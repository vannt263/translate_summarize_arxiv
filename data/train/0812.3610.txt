    "a broad class of theories is singled out by the hypothesis of minimal flavor violation ( mfv )  @xcite , which states that any flavor violation originates from yukawa couplings .",
    "the mfv hypothesis effectively suppresses new - physics contributions to most of the flavor - violating processes .",
    "however , in the search for new effects in @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 physics it is useful to consider departures from exact mfv .",
    "usually such departures are described in terms of a small expansion parameter that measures the breaking of the flavor group or of one of its subgroups .",

    "_ 1 ) degeneracy . _",
    "the starting point is the universality assumption  @xcite , which states that @xmath6 and @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : softt ] ) behave as flavor singlets .",
    "a distortion from exact universality comes from additional contributions to @xmath6 and @xmath7 which are fully generic in flavor space , but their size is characterized by a smaller mass scale , @xmath8 .",
    "the small expansion parameter is given by the ratio of these two scales , @xmath9 , _",
    "i.e. _  the ratio between the flavor - violating and flavor - symmetric terms .",
    "the rotation angles that diagonalize the squark mass matrices are generally large , because they are neither suppressed by the expansion parameter nor related to ckm angles .",
    "the suppression of flavor - violating amplitudes arises from the near degeneracy of the quark mass eigenstates .",
    "_ 2 ) alignment .",
    "_ the assumption is that quark and squark mass matrices are nearly simultaneously diagonalized by a supersymmetric field rotation , either in the down or in the up sector  @xcite .",
    "the bounds from the kaon system severely constrain the case in which @xmath10 is aligned along the up direction . the bounds on @xmath11@xmath12 mixing give important constraints on the alignment along the down direction  @xcite .",
    "correlations between quark and squark mass matrices leading to alignment are possible in models where some approximate flavor symmetry determines the form of yukawa couplings and soft terms  @xcite .",
    "flavor alignment does not imply mass degeneracy of squarks .",
    "thus , in this case the situation is exactly reversed with respect to the case of degeneracy .",
    "the suppression of flavor violating processes is due to the small squark mixing angles , while squark masses can be widely different .",
    "_ 3 ) hierarchy . _ the flavor structure of the first and second generation squarks is tightly constrained by @xmath3 physics . on the other hand ,",
    "the upper bounds on the masses of the first two generations of squarks are much looser than for the other supersymmetric particles",
    ". therefore one can relax the flavor constraints , without compromising naturalness , by taking the first two generations of squarks much heavier than the third  @xcite . as discussed in more detail in section  [ sec : nat ] , this procedure alleviates , but does not completely solve , the flavor problem and a further suppression mechanism for the first two generations must be present . however , it is not difficult to conceive the existence of such a mechanism which operates if , for instance , the soft terms respect an approximate u(2 ) symmetry acting on the first two generations  @xcite . in the case of hierarchy ,",
    "the small expansion parameter describing the flavor violation is the mismatch between the third - generation quarks identified by the yukawa coupling and the third - generation squarks identified by the light eigenstates of the soft - term mass matrix .",
    "this small mismatch can be related to the hierarchy of scales present in the squark mass matrix and to ckm angles . however , for the phenomenological implications we are interested in , we do not have to specify any such relation and we can work in an effective theory where the first two generations of squarks have been integrated out .",
    "their only remnant in the effective theory is the small mismatch between third - generation quarks and squarks .    in this paper",
    ", we will revisit the properties of hierarchical soft terms , concentrating especially on their implications in flavor physics .",
    "we will show how the hypothesis of hierarchy predicts correlations between @xmath13 and @xmath14 processes which are different from the correlations found in scenarios with degeneracy .",
    "we will present the bounds on the expansion parameters of the hierarchy case and compare them with the case of degeneracy . as a particularly interesting example we will study the phase of @xmath1 mixing , for which there are some claims  @xcite that experiments have measured an excess with respect to the sm prediction .",
    "we will show that the case of hierarchy is compatible with much larger phases of @xmath1 mixing than the case of degeneracy , and thus a hierarchical squark spectrum has more room to explain the alleged effect .",
    "the hypothesis of hierarchical soft terms states that the first two generations of squarks and sleptons are much heavier than the rest of the supersymmetric particles , assumed to lie near the electroweak scale .",
    "we will denote by @xmath15 the mass of the heavy squarks and sleptons and by @xmath16 the mass scale of the other  light \" supersymmetric particles .",
    "the original motivation of this hypothesis  @xcite is that @xmath15 is more weakly bound by naturalness arguments than other supersymmetric parameters , because its radiative effect on the higgs mass parameter @xmath17 is rather moderate .",
    "the leading effect comes from a one - loop renormalization of @xmath17 proportional to an induced hypercharge fayet - iliopoulos term ( ym^2)= tr(m_q^2+m_d^2 - 2m_u^2-m_l^2+m_e^2 ) .",
    "[ eq : fy ] assuming that soft terms are generated at the gut scale , this term leads to a naturalness bound on @xmath15 just below the tev scale  @xcite . nevertheless , the term in eq .",

    "( [ eq : fy ] ) is only multiplicatively renormalized , it will remain zero at any scale .",
    "if the fayet - iliopoulos term vanishes , then the leading renormalization of @xmath17 proportional to @xmath18 comes from two - loop effects . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nat ] we show an upper bound on @xmath15 , assuming that first and second generation scalars are degenerate at a matching scale @xmath19 , where we start the renormalization group flow .",

    "still , multi - tev squarks are allowed by naturalness .",
    "it is also possible to reach values of @xmath15 in the range of 10 tev , but only if soft terms are generated at a very low scale @xmath19 .    , assuming that first and second generation scalars are degenerate at a matching scale @xmath19 .",
    "the bound corresponds to an upper limit @xmath20 on the fine - tuning parameter.,scaledwidth=66.0% ]    another bound on the hierarchy of soft terms comes from the requirement that @xmath15 does not drive the squared masses of third - generation squarks to negative values , through its two - loop renormalization - group effect  @xcite .",
    "this bound , although weaker than the previous one , is independent of naturalness arguments .",
    "assuming complete degeneracy of the heavy states with mass @xmath15 and of the light states with mass @xmath16 , the condition that color remains unbroken imposes @xmath22 , if @xmath19 is close to the gut scale .",
    "in the case of low @xmath19 , where the effect is due to two - loop threshold effects not log enhanced , the bound becomes @xmath23 .",
    "however , these bounds can be avoided by choosing appropriate boundary conditions of the soft terms at the scale @xmath19 .",
    "for instance , all sfermions could be heavy at @xmath19 , but yukawa effects could dynamically bring the third generation to be light  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to introduce new states that approximately cancel the two - loop renormalization - group contribution to @xmath24 proportional to @xmath25 and maintain the stability of the soft - term hierarchy against large radiative corrections  @xcite .",
    "these upper bounds on @xmath15 have to be compared with the lower limits coming from flavor - violating effects in the @xmath3 system . assuming",
    "that the heavy squark sector is neither degenerate nor aligned , we find the bound . the effect of qcd corrections for heavy squarks has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] _ h > 35from the real part of the @xmath26 transition , and _",
    "h > 800from @xmath27 .",
    "this shows that the hypothesis of hierarchical soft terms is not sufficient to solve the flavor problem , unless one is willing to give up naturalness , in the spirit of split supersymmetry  @xcite , assuming that the first two generations of sfermions are directly coupled to the supersymmetry - breaking sector .",
    "more concretely , we can retain naturalness and rely on a scheme for suppressing the flavor transitions in the heavy sector , as can be achieved by an approximate u(2 ) symmetry acting on the first two generations . in this respect ,",
    "the hierarchical structure of soft terms can be a useful way of parametrizing supersymmetric theories which , for model - dependent reasons , have a certain separation of scales in the scalar sector .",
    "moreover , hierarchical soft terms are interesting because they make specific predictions in flavor physics controlled by relatively few parameters related to physical quantities , like the mass hierarchy .",
    "as we will show , hierarchical soft terms offer a well - defined benchmark to be compared with the new experimental results in flavor physics .",
    "let us first consider the gluino contribution to a @xmath28 process in the left - handed down quark sector , @xmath29 , neglecting for simplicity chirality changes .",
    "the amplitude of such a process is proportional to @xmath30 here @xmath31 is a loop function , @xmath32 is the gluino mass and @xmath33 is the unitary matrix diagonalizing the 6@xmath346 down squark squared mass matrix @xmath35 in a basis in which the down quark mass matrix is diagonal",
    ". we can simplify eq .",
    "( [ eq : ampl ] ) by using a perturbative expansion in the small off - diagonal entries of the squark mass matrix .",
    "it is often sufficient to keep the first order in the expansion .",
    "however , the second order can become important and even dominate in the case of 12 transitions , depending on the relative size of the 12 expansion parameter compared to the product of the 13 and 23 ones , and on the relative sizes of the sfermion masses .",
    "one important example of the case in which the second order dominates is the hierarchy case discussed below , in which the first order is suppressed because of the heaviness of the sfermions of the first two families .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ eq : ampl ] ) becomes  @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 the `` mass insertion '' @xmath40 is the expansion parameter and we have normalized it to a mass @xmath41 which can be chosen to be a typical scale of squark masses .",
    "this parameter effectively accounts ( at first order ) for the flavor transition .",
    "the `` degenerate '' case is obtained in the limit in which the squark masses in the loop function coincide , @xmath42 with this assumption , we obtain @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the @xmath46-th derivative of the function .",
    "the @xmath47 parameters are in this case normalized to the universal scalar mass @xmath48 .    in the `` hierarchical '' limit , the contribution to the loop function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ampl ] ) from the heavy squarks is negligible . therefore eq .  ( [ eq : ampl ] ) becomes @xmath49 here @xmath50 as before , where now @xmath48 is interpreted as the third - generation squark mass .",

    "however , this @xmath56 difference becomes larger when we consider @xmath57 processes and turns out to affect the predicted correlation between @xmath28 and @xmath57 .",
    "in fact , let us now consider the gluino contribution to a @xmath57 @xmath58 process .",

    "such processes are proportional ( for given chiralities and charge of the gaugino involved ) to the a priori independent three quantities @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "a partial correlation among the three processes could in principle be generated by higher order contributions to the @xmath68 transitions , _",
    "e.g. _ the ones proportional to @xmath73",

    "this is because of the limits on the two factors @xmath74 and @xmath75 and because the four - insertions @xmath73 contribution is proportional to @xmath76 , _",

    "in this section we define the setting of hierarchical soft terms in greater detail . in order to obtain the expressions for the amplitude of a generic flavor process in the hierarchical case",
    ", it suffices to consider the case of a one - variable loop function , as in @xmath13 transitions .",
    "the generalization to more variables is straightforward .",
    "let us then consider an amplitude whose dependence on sfermion masses comes through @xmath80 in the expression above , @xmath81 is the mass of the relevant gaugino , @xmath82 is the @xmath83 sfermion squared mass matrix in the up squark , down squark , or charged slepton sector ( the extension to sneutrinos is again straightforward ) , written in a basis in which the corresponding fermion mass matrix is diagonal and positive .",
    "the amplitude corresponds to a flavor transition between two fermions with chirality @xmath84 of families @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath33 is the unitary matrix diagonalizing @xmath82 , so that @xmath87 is the mixing between the fermion `` @xmath88 '' and the @xmath89-th sfermion mass eigenstate , @xmath90 .    according to our assumption , 4 out of the 6 squarks are much heavier than the others or the gaugino mass .",
    "their contribution to the loop function is then suppressed by the light - to - heavy ratio of squared masses @xmath91 ( at least , up to logarithms ) with respect to the contribution from third - generation squarks . however , for flavor transitions between quarks of the first two families , the exchange of third - generation squarks comes at the price of mixing angles , also suppressed by powers of the heavy mass scale @xmath92 . nevertheless , as shown in the appendix , the contribution of heavy squarks to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ampl2 ] ) is subdominant , as long as some gim mechanism is operative in the first two generation squark sector . since this must be the case in order to evade the strong constraints from @xmath27",
    ", we can neglect the effect of the heavy squarks in the summation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ampl2 ] ) .",
    "alternatively , the assumption of neglecting the heavy - state exchange is justified when the first two generations of squarks are completely decoupled and the flavor mixing of the third - generation squarks are determined by quark rotation angles ( see appendix ) .    we are then left with two light squarks with masses @xmath93 and mixings @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the index of the light eigenstates .",
    "this gives a total of 2 + 20 real parameters .",
    "however , since the mixings always appear in the combination @xmath96 , the overall phases of the mixing parameters ( for any value of @xmath97 ) do not affect eq .",
    "( [ eq : ampl2 ] ) and the number of effective parameters is 2 + 18 .",
    "this is still more general than needed .",
    "in fact , the decoupling of the first two sfermion families leads ( under certain assumptions ) to two additional constraints , as discussed in the appendix .",
    "first , in the limit in which the 4 heavy sfermions decouple , the 2@xmath342 matrix @xmath98 that diagonalizes the 2@xmath342 third - family sfermion mass matrix is approximately unitary .",
    "it is then always possible to describe it in terms of an angle @xmath99 and a phase @xmath100 .",
    "the angle @xmath101 corresponds to the usual mixing angle between the two chiral components of third - generation squarks .",
    "second , the chirality - changing mixing is subdominant with respect to the chirality - conserving one , except within the third family .",
    "this means that the leading effect in any chirality - changing transition comes from the combination of a chirality - conserving one times a @xmath101-angle rotation .",
