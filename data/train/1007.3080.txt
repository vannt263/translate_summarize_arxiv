    "in equilibrium statistical mechanics , the boltzmann - gibbs probability distribution is at the heart of the connection between the micro- and macroscopic level of systems made of a large number of particles @xmath0 . from that distribution",
    ", one may compute the relevant thermodynamic potentials which may be interpreted as rate functions at speed @xmath0 governing the large deviations of the macroscopic quantity of interest .",
    "typically , the lack of strict convexity of the thermodynamic potentials is the signature of the existence of phase transitions . out of equilibrium",
    ", there is not a such thing as the boltzmann - gibbs formula for the microscopic configurations and , in order to understand the macroscopic behaviour of a given material , one must proceed differently .",
    "building on the seminal work of onsager and machlup @xcite , several authors have built a general picture of the macroscopic current fluctuations in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics , see @xcite for overviews of the subject .",
    "although this approach is rigorously justified only in the framework of stochastic interacting particles , the scope is much more ambitious .",
    "macroscopic fluctuation theory describes , after a diffusive rescaling of space and time , the macroscopic behaviour of extended systems crossed by a flow of a conserved quantity : energy , mass or other relevant quantities . in this approach ,",
    "the classical thermodynamical potentials are replaced by a rate function describing the fluctuations in space - time of the local currents and energies . from the point of view of the theory of large deviations",
    "this rate functional is strictly analogous to the equilibrium thermodynamic potentials in the sense that it is a large deviations rate function at speed @xmath0 . from the knowledge of this rate function",
    "one may , as in equilibrium , compute the cumulants of the relevant physical quantities . starting from a quadratic form for the rate functionnal ,",
    "this is what is achieved in @xcite where a relation for the successive cumulants of the current is obtained .",
    "a fundamental issue , on which almost no result exist for realistic physical systems , is to determine the form of the non - equilibrium rate function .    in this paper ,",
    "our goal is to derive the form that this rate function must take in a general class of hamiltonian models including aerogels .",
    "these materials are gels whose liquid component has been removed and replaced by atoms of gases .",
    "because of their particular insulating properties , they have proved useful in applications ranging from the manufacturing of new insulating glasses to the engineering of key parts of space probes .",
    "the theoretical models we will consider are easy to study numerically and well described by a local equilibrium assumption @xcite in a weakly interacting regime .",
    "using a stochastic approximation , we show that the function describing the macroscopic fluctuations of those models is drastically different from the one generally expected and obtained since the work of onsager and machlup @xcite . as a function of the current it is _ not _",
    "a quadratic function around the stationary current .",
    "more than that , it is neither a smooth nor a strictly convex function .",
    "this means , by analogy with the equilibrium case , that aerogels must exhibit interesting out of equilibrium phase transitions phenomena .",
    "this should also apply to a class of models made of tracers and scatterers recently considered by several authors @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that our main working hypothesis is the validity of the description of the systems at a diffusive space - time scale .",
    "this amounts to assuming the _ existence _ of a rate function and does not have any implication _ a priori _ on the specific shape that this function must take .",
    "the validity of the diffusive description of macroscopic systems should hold for a large class of mechanical systems . on the other hand ,",
    "there are very few a priori constraints imposed on the rate function except a global one imposed by the gallavotti - cohen symmetry and arguably local ones ( on the first two derivatives ) imposed by linear response theory .",
    "we will see , however , that the collisional mechanism by which the energy is transported through the system by the microscopic components is responsible for a singular shape of the rate function .",
    "the two constraints stated above are still satisfied .",
    "the dynamics that we want to consider is as follows .",
    "consider @xmath0 particles of unit mass with positions and momenta @xmath1 , with @xmath2 .",
    "the positions are measured with respect to @xmath0 fixed centers located on a 1d lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath3 takes the form @xmath4 , \\label{hamilton}\\ ] ] where the interaction potential @xmath5 is equal to zero inside a region @xmath6 with smooth boundary @xmath7 of dimension @xmath8 , and equal to infinity outside .",
    "likewise , the pinning potential @xmath9 is assumed to be zero inside a bounded region @xmath10 and infinite outside , implying that the motion of a single particle remains confined for all times .",
    "the regions @xmath11 and @xmath10 being specified , the dynamics is equivalent to a billiard in high dimension .",
    "a typical example is given by the figure below .",
    "each disk moves freely within its square cell and collides with a neighbor when they both get sufficiently close to the hole located in the wall separating their adjacent cells .",
    "the first type of such models , in which the local dynamics is described by semi - dispersing billiards , was introduced in @xcite and its thermal transport properties were studied in @xcite .",
    "general collisional models of this type have been introduced and analyzed in @xcite . to model those systems out of equilibrium ,",
    "one couples them at their boundaries with stochastic thermal walls at different temperatures .",
    "rigorously , almost nothing is known about the invariant state of such systems .",
    "heuristically , however , the behavior of such systems is easy to guess @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the energy of the @xmath12-th particle may be written as , @xmath13-j_{n\\to n+1}[0,t].\\ ] ] where @xmath14&= & { { \\frac{1}{2}}}\\sum_{0\\leq k\\leq n_t } \\left [ p_{n}^\\bot(s_k)^2 -      p^\\bot_{n+1}(s_k)^2 \\right]\\label{timeint } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath15 is the component of the vector @xmath16 in the direction of the unit vector @xmath17 at the time of collision , namely @xmath18 .",
    "the integer @xmath19 counts the number of collisions up to time @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the @xmath22-th collision time .",
    "assume now that such systems are thermalized at different temperatures at their boundaries . in order to understand the transfer of energy from one side to the other , one is interested in the ergodic behavior of the current and in computing @xmath23 , $ ] giving the average current of energy in the stationary state .",
    "because of the special form of the time - integrated current ( [ timeint ] ) , a natural guess to make is that local equilibrium settles in and to assume that this limit is given by @xmath24=\\nu \\ , ( t_n - t_{n+1 } ) \\label{fourier}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the frequency of collisions between neighbors under local equilibrium conditions and @xmath26 is the average kinetic energy of the particles .",
    "the conductivity is thus identified to the frequency of collisions .",
    "typically , the collisions occur when the particles get near the boundaries of their cell and thus the frequency of collisions is roughly proportional to the average number of visits to the boundaries per unit time . because the particle travels freely within its cell , this is proportional to the square root of the average energy and thus to @xmath27 .",
    "numerical studies show that the identification of the conductivity with the frequency of collisions holds true to a very high degree of accuracy in a wide class of collisional dynamics , when the individual particles collide rarely @xcite .",
    "in macroscopic fluctuation theory , the evolution of the relevant variables is described after a diffusive rescaling .",
    "one introduces a macroscopic evolution time variable @xmath28 and a continuous space variable @xmath29 to describe functions on the spatial lattice by functions on the interval @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "one assumes that the system may be described by smooth functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 related to the original time - integrated current and energy by @xmath33&=&n\\hat j\\left(\\frac{i}{n},\\frac{t}{n^2}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ e_i(t)&=&\\epsilon \\left(\\frac{i}{n},\\frac{t}{n^2}\\right ) .",

    "nevertheless , in the stochastic models that have been studied so far , it is known that @xmath42 is a quadratic function of the current around the stationary current in the diffusive scaling limit @xcite .",
    "we assume that macroscopic fluctuation theory applies to our models in the sense that there exist smooth functions @xmath32 and @xmath31 and that ( [ ldn ] ) and ( [ phi0 ] ) hold true .",
    "we argue now that in the deterministic models described above @xmath42 can not be quadratic in @xmath37 and is rather given by ( [ scaling ] ) below .",
    "we assume that the functions @xmath42 , @xmath37 and @xmath32 are sufficiently smooth , we discretize space with increments of size @xmath43 and time with small steps of size @xmath44 and set : @xmath45}\\sum_{k=1}^{n } \\phi_{k , l } \\label{riemann}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with , @xmath46,e_k(l\\delta s)\\right ) \\ ] ] and we identify @xmath47 as the probability of observing an instantaneous current @xmath48 at site @xmath22 during a small macroscopic time interval @xmath44 , while the local energy and energy gradient are fixed . a key observation for our purpose is the following : as the macroscopic time varies by a small increment @xmath44 , the energy @xmath32 changes only by an amount proportional to that increment . on the other hand , in terms of the original microscopic variables",
    ", this corresponds to very long time scale @xmath49 . observing an instantaneous current @xmath50 over a small interval of time",
    "@xmath44 corresponds to observing an average time - integrated current @xmath51=j_k(s)n\\delta s. $ ] because of this relation we identify the probability of finding an instantaneous current @xmath48 with the probability of observing an average time - integrated current ( over a microscopic time interval @xmath49 ) equal to @xmath52 .",

    "we assume further that the dynamics is sufficiently chaotic so that the dynamical correlations between neighbors are destroyed between two collisions among them .",
    "this leads us to model the system during a time slice @xmath44 by the following stochastic dynamics .",
    "each particle moves freely in its cell and the effect of the collisions of a given particle with its neighbors is modeled by the action of hot walls at fixed temperatures .",
    "the temperatures of the walls correspond to the average energies of the particles , which are fixed during the small macroscopic time interval @xmath44 .",
    "pictorially , the model of figure 1 is transformed into the model of the figure below .",
    "clearly , the direction orthogonal to the array of heat baths is irrelevant to the transport of energy and one is thus lead to the model of _ confined tracers _ introduced in @xcite .",
    "each particle moves freely in an interval and when it encounters the hot walls located at its boundaries , its velocity is reflected and it gets a new random speed @xmath56 distributed according to the distribution : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the inverse of the temperature of the wall where the collision has taken place .",
    "we note that when the temperatures on the boundaries are equal , the invariant distribution of the random process describing the evolution of the position and velocity of the particle is given by the equilibrium maxwell - boltzmann - gibbs formula @xcite .",
    "it is very important to note that if one takes as the updating rule a maxwellian distribution , one does _ not _ get the maxwell - boltzmann - gibbs distribution as the invariant measure for the random process . in the stochastic model the energy",
    "current corresponding to a given particle is given by : @xmath59=\\sigma_0\\frac 1 2\\sum_{k=1}^{n_t}(-1)^k v_k^2\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the speed the particle gets at the @xmath22-th collision with a wall , @xmath19 is the number of collisions up to time @xmath20 and @xmath61 is the sign of the initial velocity .",
    "it is important to note at this stage that the form of the current is based on the deterministic part of dynamics , it simply corresponds to the kinetic energy carried by particles moving back and forth . as we will see below , @xmath19 , whose large deviation properties",
    "will be central to our argument , depends in a simple fashion on the sequence of velocities assumed by the particle .",
    "this is because the deterministic motion of the particle between the interactions with the walls is ballistic .",
    "one can show that , @xmath62}{t}=\\frac{t_l - t_r}{(\\frac{\\pi}{2t_l})^{{\\frac{1}{2}}}+(\\frac{\\pi}{2t_r})^{{\\frac{1}{2}}}}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the left and right temperatures .    in @xcite , we study in details the large deviations functional of the current @xmath65 defined as : @xmath66}{t}= j\\right)\\sim e^{-t { { \\ensuremath{\\mathcal i } } } ( j,\\tau , t)},\\quad t\\to\\infty.\\ ] ] @xmath67 is the probability associated to the stochastic dynamics with a fixed temperature difference @xmath68 between the two walls and average temperature @xmath69 .",

    "\\label{scaling}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 . when @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "denoting the rhs by @xmath75 , we observe that it has the gallavotti - cohen symmetry : @xmath76 the most striking feature of the functionals @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the fact that they vanish on the interval @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "the origin of this phenomenon may be traced back to the occurrence of slow velocities with sufficiently large probability in the course of the motion of the particle .",
    "more precisely , the process can be entirely characterized by the sequence @xmath80 of waiting times between collisions of the particle with the walls .",
    "those waiting times are equal to the inverse of the random speeds @xmath81 and are thus distributed according to a density : @xmath82 the study of the large deviations of the current boils down to analyzing the large deviations of the markov renewal process @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the fact that the distribution @xmath86 decays only polynomially as @xmath87 , implies that the large deviations functional of @xmath88 is identically equal to zero between @xmath89 and @xmath90 . a key point to see this is the following : for @xmath91 , @xmath92 + 1}>t\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & \\geq & { { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb p } } } _ { \\tau , t}\\left(t_1",
    "> t\\right)\\sim t^{-2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and taking the log on both sides of the inequalities , dividing by @xmath20 , this implies that the large deviations functional vanishes at least in @xmath93 . taking care of technicalities which involves the proof of the convexity of the functional ( see @xcite ) , one concludes .",
    "we go back to the computation @xmath94 : we basically identify the lhs of ( [ phij ] ) with the large deviations functional of the stochastic dynamics .",
    "namely , we write :    @xmath95    then , using ( [ scaling ] ) and ( [ riemann ] ) one obtains finally : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is given by the rhs of ( [ scaling ] ) .",
    "as a rigorous derivation of the relation ( [ scaling ] ) for deterministic systems seems at the moment out of reach , it is of great importance to derive observable consequences which could be tested either in physical experiments or in numerical simulations . by analogy with the equilibrium case , we expect the lack of analyticity of @xmath42 to be responsible for the occurrence of phase transitions .",
    "how those will manifest themselves in physical or numerical experiments is at this stage an open question .",
    "we note that those phase transitions are of different kind than the ones found in @xcite . in those works",
    ", they are obtained from a quadratic @xmath42 when optimizing the energy profile to get a given current . in our case",
    ", they are present in the system from the beginning , in the sense that @xmath42 itself is a non - analytic function",
    ". it would be interesting to determine what happens to the relation giving the successive cumulants of the current derived in @xcite which was based on a quadratic form of @xmath42 .",
    "we expect the relation ( [ scaling ] ) to be generic in local collisional dynamics , not only in the models we described above but also in deterministic models made of tracer particles and fixed scatterers @xcite .",
    "this is because our argument is based only on the fact that the current is carried by a particle travelling ballistically between one collision and the next and on a local equilibrium hypothesis implying the occurence of particles with arbitrarily low speed in the system .",
    "more precisely ( [ scaling ] ) should govern the macroscopic fluctuations of the system whenever it appears to be well described by a local equilibrium distribution .",
    "this applies to the dynamics of @xcite in a weakly interacting regime and to the _ confined _ tracers models of @xcite .",
    "however , it does _ not _ apply to those among the models of @xcite in which the tracers are allowed to travel from cell to cell . in those models ,",
    "the average over long times of the local transfer of energy can not be a local quantity .",
    "indeed the local transfer of energy is due to particles travelling all along the system and their average frequency of visits to a given cell will depend on the temperatures of every scatterers they meet during their journey .",
    "we do not expect the behaviour described by ( [ scaling ] ) to occur in other types of lattice hamiltonian dynamics in which the components interact through a smooth potential .",
    "we emphasize also that it is not the fact that we replaced the deterministic collisions by stochastic ones that is responsible for the special behaviour of @xmath42 .",
    "this is caused by what is left of the deterministic dynamics , namely the ballistic motion of the particle .",
    "in particular , one should not expect the same phenomenon to occur in the case of self - consistent harmonic chain @xcite .",
    "the main striking feature of @xmath42 , namely its flat part , is due to the deterministic part that we have not modified .",
    "therefore , one should expect this feature to be robust and independent of the approximations that we made for the collisional part of the dynamics .",
    "we note finally that a similar large deviations functional has been found in the context of random walks in random environments @xcite ."
