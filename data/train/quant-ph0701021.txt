    "<S> it is well known that the dissipation or dephasing will deteriorate the degree of nonclassicality of the optical fields . </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative measure of non - classicality of quantum fields is necessary for further investigating the dynamical behavior of their non - classicality . </S>",
    "<S> many authors have investigated the relations between non - classicality of optical fields and the entanglement and shown that non - classicality is a necessary condition for generating inseparable state via the beam splitter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> based on them , a measure called the entanglement potential for quantifying the non - classicality of the single - mode optical field has been proposed @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> nevertheless , experimental measurement of the entanglement potential is still a challenge task . how to quantify the variation of the nonclassicality of quantum fields based on the current mature laboratory technique is an interesting topic . </S>",
    "<S> the wigner function is a quasi - probability distribution , which fully describes the state of a quantum system in phase space . </S>",
    "<S> the partial negativity of the wigner function is indeed a good indication of the highly nonclassical character of the state . </S>",
    "<S> reconstructions of the wigner functions in experiments with quantum tomography @xcite have demonstrated appearance of their negative values , which can not be explained in the framework of the probability theory and have not any classical counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to seek certain possible monotonic relation between the partial negativity of the wigner distribution and the entanglement potential may be an available first step for experimentally quantifying the variation of nonclassicality of quantum optical fields in dissipative or dephasing environments .    here , for clarifying the feasibility of this idea </S>",

    "<S> is introduced , and our calculations show it reduces with the increase of decay time . </S>",
    "<S> the total negative probability and the entanglement potential of pure photon - added coherent states exhibit the similar dependence on the beam intensity . </S>",
    "<S> the reduce of total negative probability is consistent with the behavior of entanglement potential for the dissipative single - photon - added coherent state at short decay times .    </S>",
    "<S> the photon - added coherent state was introduced by agarwal and tara @xcite . the single photon - added coherent state ( spacs ) is experimentally prepared by zavatta et al . and its nonclassical properties are detected by homodyne tomography technology @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a state represents the intermediate non - gaussian state between quantum fock state and classical coherent state ( with well - defined amplitude and phase ) @xcite . for the spacs </S>",
    "<S> , a quantum to classical transition has been explicitly demonstrated by ultrafast time - domain quantum homodyne tomography technique . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is timely to analyze how the photon loss affects the non - classicality of such kind of optical fields .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first briefly recall the definition of the photon - added coherent states ( pacss ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pacss are defined by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the coherent state with the amplitude @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the creation operator of the optical mode . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the @xmath12th - order laguerre polynomial . </S>",
    "<S> when the pacs evolves in the photon loss channel , the evolution of the density matrix can be described by @xcite = ( 2a^-a^a-^a ) , where @xmath13 represents dissipative coefficient . </S>",

    "<S> for the dissipative photon - added coherent state in eq.(3 ) , the total output state passing through a 50/50 beam splitter characterized by the unitary operation @xmath15 with a vacuum mode b can be obtained or _ tot = d_a(t)d_b(t)^_k=0 + ^k^|0000|^m^d^_a(t)d^_b(t),where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the displacement operators of the modes a and b , respectively , where @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 . the local unitary operators can not change entanglement , therefore , we only need to consider the entanglement of the mixed state given as follows : ^_tot=^_k=0 + ^k^|0000|^m^.the log - negativity of the above density matrix can be analytically solved for the case of single photon excitation , i.e. @xmath20 , but its expression is still lengthy . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding entanglement potential of the spacss quantified by log - negativity is given in fig.5(b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the presence of negativity in the wigner function of the field is also the indicator of nonclassicality . </S>",
    "<S> the wigner function , the fourier transformation of characteristics function @xcite of the state can be derived by @xcite w()=[(_e-_o)()^()],where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the even and odd parity operators respectively . in the photon loss channel described by the master equation ( 2 ) , the time evolution wigner function satisfies the following fokker - planck equation @xcite w(q , p , t)&=&(q+p)w(q , p , t ) + & & + ( + ) w(q , p , t).where @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent the real part and imaginary part of @xmath25 , respectively . substituting the initial wigner function of a spacs @xcite w(q , </S>",
    "<S> p,0)=e^-2|q+ip-|^2and the initial wigner function of a two photon - added coherent state ( tpacs ) @xcite w(q , p,0)=e^-2|q+ip-|^2into the eq.(7 ) , we can obtain the time evolution wigner function . in fig.1 , the wigner function of the spacs with @xmath26 at three different values of decay time are plotted . </S>",
    "<S> the phase space wigner distribution of the pure spacs with @xmath26 loses its circular symmetry and moves away from the origin because of the appearance of a definite phase . </S>",
    "<S> the partial negativity of the wigner function indicates the nonclassical nature of the single quantum excitation of the classical coherent field . </S>",
    "<S> the photon loss causes the gradual disappearance of the partial negativity of the wigner function . </S>",
    "<S> the tilted ringlike wings in the distribution gradually start to disappear and the distribution becomes more and more similar to the gaussian typical of a classical coherent field . in fig.2 , </S>",

    "<S> , width=240 ]    a natural question arises whether the partial negativity of the wigner function can be used to quantitatively measure the non - classicality of certain kinds of nonclassical fields . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that the negative minimum of the wigner function can not appropriately quantitatively measure the nonclassicality . </S>",

    "<S> comparing fig.2(a , b ) with fig.4(a , b ) respectively , the negative minimum in the wigner function of the pure spacss is smaller than the one of the pure tpacss . </S>",
    "<S> however , there was already the evidence that the pure tpacss possesses larger nonclassicality than the pure spacs with the same @xmath32 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the absolute value @xmath37 of the total negative probability of the wigner function may be a good choice for quantifying the nonclassicality . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37 is defined by p_nw=|_w(q , p)dqdp|,where @xmath38 is the negative wigner distribution region , and @xmath39 represents the absolute value of @xmath40 . in fig.5(a ) , we plot @xmath37 of the spacss with different values of @xmath8 as the function of @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37 decreases with @xmath28 , and becomes invisible after a threshold value of @xmath41 . in fig.5(b ) , the entanglement potential quantified by log - negativity of spacss in the photon - loss channel is plotted . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement potential also decreases with @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations partially elucidate the consistent between @xmath37 and the entanglement potential of the dissipative spacss at short time . </S>",
    "<S> currently , the experimental quantitative investigation of the nonclassicality of the quantum optical fields is still an open issue , and the experimental measurement of entanglement potential has still several technical difficulties . </S>",
    "<S> so , the measurement of @xmath37 may be adopted as a replaced approach to investigate the influence of photon loss on the nonclassicality of the spacss . in fig.5(c ) , we also investigate the effect of photon loss on @xmath37 of the tpacss with various values of @xmath8 . at short decay times </S>",
