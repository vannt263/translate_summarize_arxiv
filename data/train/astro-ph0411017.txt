    "when a co white dwarf accretes matter , its centre gets denser and hotter . at some point ,",
    "the c - c burning ignites mildly in the centre . when the radiative luminosity can no longer get rid of the heat produced , a convective core forms and grows as the burning releases more and more energy . during the burning process",
    ", urca pairs such as @xmath1ne are produced .",
    "these release neutrinos through emission and capture of electrons preferentially around urca shells . the net amount of energy released and the change in the electron fraction at the time of the explosion have always been uncertain due to the lack of a convective model self - consistent with the energy and chemistry budgets @xcite .",
    "former theoretical attempts @xcite to describe the interplay between convection and chemistry have all left open the question of energy conservation . +",
    "a better understanding of the phase immediately preceding the thermal runaway provides an essential link between the core evolution in the progenitor and the supernova explosion .",
    "knowledge of the physical and chemical profile at the time of the explosion may also provide new insight in the physics of the explosion itself .",
    "indeed , the neutron excess at the time of ignition is a crucial parameter of the explosion , and it is strongly affected by the convective urca process .",
    "except for the work of iben @xcite , the convective urca process has been so far neglected in presupernova computations .",
    "this is because we lack a proper energy equation in a convective region . indeed , far from the urca shell , out of equilibrium nuclear heating overwhelms neutrino losses @xcite .",
    "hence the net heating crucially depends on the actual chemical mixing .",
    "the amount of convective work necessary to carry the electrons is uncertain @xcite .",
    "last but not least , in degenerate matter chemistry controls the buoyancy and thence the convective velocities .",
    "fortunately , the problem is well known and solved in the _ radiative _ state .",
    "our basic idea is to mimic convection by considering the interaction between two _ radiative _ columns of fluid side by side @xcite .",
    "the resulting convective model * guarantees energy conservation*. besides , it is time - dependent , non - local , allows for different rising and descending convective velocities , describes horizontal chemical inhomogeneities and treats the interaction of convection with the mean flow .",
    "we have checked carefully different limits of our model against corresponding existing convective models @xcite and found good agreement .",
    "although the full model would be rather difficult to implement in a convective core , the one - stream , local , time independent limit yields a straightforward extension of the mixing length theory fully consistent with chemistry and energy budget .",
    "the main difference with the mixing length is the dependence of the convective velocity on the chemical gradients .",
    "we use our convective model to compute convective cores with a homogeneous total abundance for the urca pair a=23 .",
    "indeed this pair operates at mass density 1.7  10@xmath2  g  @xmath3 and is hence one of the main actors at the onset of c burning which occurs around density 2  10@xmath2  g  @xmath3 and temperature 3  10@xmath4  k.      we first used the full two - stream model to compute _ stationary _ convective cores .",
    "we varied the mass fraction of urca matter @xmath5 from 10@xmath6 to 10@xmath7 .",
    "strong modifications of the convective profile occur for mass fractions higher than 10@xmath8 as fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows .",
    "analytical arguments on the existence of a stationary convective core confirm this low threshold .     of the urca pair a=23 . ]",
    "the convective velocities are strongly reduced by the presence of urca matter .",
    "indeed , the velocity of a convective blob is proportional to its difference in density with the surrounding medium .",
    "besides , the density of degenerate matter depends mainly on the electron number density .",
    "this means that * convection in degenerate matter crucially depends on electron emissions and captures*. these simulations also show that the one - stream , local limit is a good approximation to the two - stream model in this context .",
    "we have started to implement a one - stream , stationary limit of the two - stream model in p.  eggleton s stellar evolution code @xcite .",
    "this has already required significant changes to the code to handle chemical gradients with sufficient accuracy .",
    "first , it appears that the backreaction of the chemical gradients on the convective velocity , and hence the mixing , causes serious convergence problems .",
    "we momentarily overcome these problems by artificially lowering the mixing at the outer edge of the convective core .",
    "simulations with @xmath9 confirm the reduction of the convective speed which now takes place only upward of the urca shell .",
    "second , for higher urca mass fractions , our code breaks down when the outer edge of the convective core reaches the urca shell . at this point ,",
    "the convective state changes on short time scales due to the gradient of the urca composition .",
    "we have developed a new convective model suitable for studying the convective urca process .",
    "a first application to stationary convective cores suggests that electron emissions and captures control convection in degenerate matter .",
    "we hence expect to uncover new results on the initial conditions for the explosion of type ia ( and possibly core - collapse supernovae ) .",
    "in particular , we shall be able to predict the degree of neutronisation at the time of the thermal run - away , a crucial parameter for explosive nucleosynthesis        9 paczyski b. 1972 , apl 11 , 53 bruenn s. 1973 , apj 183 , l125 couch r. g. , arnett w. d. 1975 , apj 196 , 791 iben i. 1978 , apj 219 , 213 iben i. 1978 , apj 226 , 996 iben i. 1982 , apj 253 , 248 barkat z. , wheeler j. c. 1990 , apj 355 , 602 mochkovitch r. 1996 , a&a 311 , 152 stein j. , barkat z. , wheeler , j. c. 1999 , apj 523 , 381 bisnovatyi - kogan g. s. 2001 , mnras 321 , 315 eggleton p. p. 1983 , mnras 204 , 449 grossman s. a. , narayan r. , arnett d. 1993 , apj 407 , 284 canuto v. m. 1999 , apj 524 , 311 lesaffre p. , podsiadlowki ph . , tout c. a. 2004 , mnras _ submitted _ unno w. 1967 , pasj 19 , 140 eggleton , p. p. , 1971 ,",
