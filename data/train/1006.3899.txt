    "the observed fractions of various types of core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) provide key information about the evolution and ultimate fates of massive stars .",
    "because of their tremendous luminosity , sne can potentially be used as diagnostics of mass loss and the evolution of individual stars at great distances and in a variety of galactic environments , but only if we first understand how to map initial masses and evolution of different progenitor stars to the various types of sne that they produce .",
    "if drawn from a stellar population that obeys a standard initial mass function ( imf ) , the observed fractions of different ccsn types constrain the ranges of initial mass for their progenitors , as well as the evolutionary paths they take before death .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore how the imf can be sampled in order to be consistent with the observed fractions of ccsn types .",
    "the main observed types of sne that we consider are ii - p ( plateau ) , ii - l ( linear ) , iin ( relatively narrow lines ) , iib ( transitional ) , ib , ic , and ibc - pec ( see  2 ) .",
    "spectroscopic classification criteria for these are reviewed by filippenko ( 1997 ) .",
    "pre - sn mass loss of the progenitor star determines which of these types of sn is seen , stripping away various amounts of the star s h and possibly he envelopes before core collapse ejects the remaining envelope .",
    "sne  ibc are the result of complete removal of the h envelope , sne  iib have retained only a small h mass ( typically @xmath00.5 m@xmath1 ) , while sne  ii - l and ii - p have retained increasingly more of their h envelopes .",
    "sne  iin are different in the sense that their spectral appearance is determined largely by shock interaction with circumstellar material ( csm ) lost in the decades or centuries preceding core collapse .",
    "the three potential mechanisms for a sn progenitor s mass loss are via steady winds , eruptive mass loss , or mass transfer due to roche - lobe overflow ( rlof ) in a close binary system . depending on which dominates , the amount of mass lost may or may not depend in a simple way on metallicity or on the initial mass of the progenitor star , making reliable predictions difficult without a more complete understanding of mass loss .",
    "the evolutionary state  red supergiant ( rsg ) , blue supergiant ( bsg ) , luminous blue variable ( lbv ) , and wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars of the wn and wc sequences  and hence the stellar radius at the time of explosion , are also important , although these can be considered as largely the _ result _ of mass loss .",
    "massive stars have substantial steady stellar winds through most of their lives ( see lamers & cassinelli 1999 ) , with either metallicity - dependent , line - driven winds in hot stars ( kudritzki & puls 2000 ) , or slow , pulsation / dust - driven winds in cool stars ( reimers 1977 ) .",
    "single - star evolution models adopt simple prescriptions for these steady winds ( meynet et al .",
    "1994 ) , and aim to predict the fates of massive stars as functions of initial mass and metallicity ( e.g. , heger et al .  2003",
    "; eldridge & tout 2004 ) .    recent observational work , however , has demonstrated that the standard observational mass - loss rates used as input to these models are far too high ; the standard mass - loss rates of hot stars ( e.g. , nieuwenhuijzen & de jager 1990 ; de jager et al .",
    "1998 ) are reduced by factors of 310 when the effects of clumping are considered properly ( bouret et al .",
    "2005 ; fullerton et al .  2006 ; puls et al .  2006 ) .",
    "there is also a parallel problem in cool star mass - loss rates  reduction of an order of magnitude to the standard reimers formula for red giants may be required ( mszros et al.2009 ) , and it would be interesting if this also affects more massive rsg stars .",
    "these lower mass - loss rates have a profound impact on stellar evolution and sn progenitors , requiring us to turn to either eruptive mass loss ( smith & owocki 2006 ) or close binaries ( e.g. , paczyski 1967 ) to make up the deficit .",
    "we will see that this turns out to be a major theme in explaining the frequencies of sn types .",
    "the stripping of a star s h envelope due to mass transfer in rlof binary systems has long been considered a likely mechanism to produce wr stars and the progenitors of sne  ibc ( e.g. , paczyski 1967 ; podsiadlowski et al .",
    "recent stellar evolution models attempt to account for this ( e.g. , eldridge et al .",
    "2008 ) , but considerable uncertainty surrounds empirical estimates of binary fractions ; see kobulnicky & fryer ( 2007 ) and references therein .",
    "in addition to close binary evolution , a major uncertainty concerns the net effect of episodic and eruptive mass loss during late stages of stellar evolution ( smith & owocki 2006 ) .",
    "these outbursts are observed to occur , and studies suggest that they shed more mass from a star than do steady winds ( smith & owocki 2006 ) . the importance of sudden , short - duration eruptive mass loss is a concern for the predictive power of any stellar evolution model , none of which currently include it .",
    "observational clues from csm interaction in sne  iin dictate that heavy mass loss sometimes occurs shortly before core collapse ( e.g. , smith et al .",
    "2007 , 2008b , 2010 ; chugai et al.2004 ) ; if heavy mass loss is concentrated in brief events during the last few thousand years before core collapse , then the statistical distribution of end fates ( i.e. , sn types ) wo nt necessarily reflect the observed relative fractions of wn , wc , rsg , lbvs , and so on , which are determined by the time spent in each state .",
    "this is critical and potentially misleading , since many stellar evolution codes are linked to these observed fractions .",
    "another key point is that both binaries and eruptions are probably less sensitive to metallicity than line - driven winds of hot stars .",
    "some studies have shown that the observed fraction of sne  ibc compared to sne  ii increases with metallicity , implying that metallicity - dependent winds play an important role ( prantzos & boissier 2003 ; prieto et al .",
    "2008 ; boissier & prantzos 2009 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "observations have also revealed a large population of wr stars in low - metallicity galaxies , which can not be explained by stellar winds alone ( izotov et al .",
    "1997 ; brown et al .  2002",
    "; crowther & hadfield 2006 ) , while the broad - lined sne  ic that accompany gamma - ray bursts ( see woosley & bloom 2006 for a review ) seem to prefer low metallicity ( stanek et al .",
    "2006 ; modjaz et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "there have been a few previous investigations of relative sn rates that our study builds upon .",
    "cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) examined the statistics from 110 sne ( including sne  ia ) , deriving widely adopted rates of various sn types in different environments .",
    "more recently , smartt et al .  ( 2009 ) considered a volume - limited sample of nearby ccsne and examined the relative fractions of sne ii - p , ii - l , iib , iin , ib , and ic , as we do .",
    "our results are different from theirs , as described below , leading to some quite different implications for massive stars .",
    "finally , arcavi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have recently submitted a paper independent of our study using sne from the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) , finding a difference in the relative fractions of sne ii , iib , ib , ic , and broad - lined ic between large galaxies and dwarf galaxies . since our survey did not adequately sample dwarf galaxies , the study by arcavi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) is complementary to ours , although we find significantly different relative fractions of sn types in large galaxies .",
    "we also consider direct detections of sn progenitor stars from pre - explosion data , discussed in considerable detail below and reviewed recently by smartt ( 2009 ) . throughout",
    ", we include this information along with current ideas about massive single and binary stars .",
    "here we present and discuss the implications of the observed relative fractions of different types of ccsne in a new volume - limited sample , measured during the course of the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ) conducted with the katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ; filippenko et al .",
    "this follows a series of papers discussing loss .",
    "paper i ( leaman et al .  2010 ) describes the method of deriving rates from loss data , paper ii ( li et al .",
    "2010a ) discusses the luminosity functions of sne and gives a detailed discussion of how the different fractions of sn types were derived , and paper iii ( li et al .",
    "2010b ) presents relations with host galaxies and other details .",
    ".volume - limited core - collapse sn fractions [ cols=\"<,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "figure  [ fig : pie ] shows a pie chart illustrating the relative fractions of different types of ccsne derived from loss .",
    "these values are taken from the volume - limited fractions of all sn types derived in paper  ii , with the thermonuclear ( type  ia ) explosions subtracted from the sample .",
    "the relative fractions of the total for ccsne are listed in table 1 , and these values are adopted throughout this work . see paper  ii for further details on how these numbers are derived from our survey . errors in table  1 were estimated using a random poisson number generator to sample from a list of fake sne with fractions corrected for various observing biases , with 10@xmath2 realizations .",
    "paper  ii discusses this in more detail .",
    "there are several important points to note here .",
    "this volume - limited sample of ccsne excludes most of the so - called `` sn impostors '' ( e.g. , van dyk 2010 ; smith et al .  2010 , in preparation ) , which appear as relatively faint sne  iin that are often discovered by kait .",
    "if we had included them , the fraction of sne  iin would be significantly higher ; note that even without the sn impostors , however , our relative fraction of sne  iin is higher than in previous studies ( cappellaro et al .",
    "1999 ; smartt 2009 ) .",
    "the criteria for excluding an individual sn impostor are admittedly somewhat subjective , but this is a necessary step since the diversity and potential overlap of sne  iin and massive star eruptions are not fully understood yet . generally ,",
    "if an object has a peak absolute @xmath3 or unfiltered magnitude brighter than @xmath4 and has line widths indicating expansion speeds faster than about 1000 km s@xmath5 , we include it as a real sn  iin .",
    "less luminous and slower objects are considered impostors and are excluded .    unlike previous studies , we include a category called `` sne  ibc - pec '' ( peculiar ; see paper ii ) .",
    "this category was necessary to introduce in paper  ii because some sn  ibc vary significantly from the template light curves used to derive the control times for sne  ib and ic .",
    "as such , the `` ibc - pec '' category in paper ii includes some broad - lined sne  ic such as sn  2002ap that are clearly sne  ic .",
    "we have moved these to the sn  ic category for the purpose of this paper , since they clearly correspond to massive stars that have fully shed their h and he envelopes .",
    "this has a small effect on the overall statistics , because broad - lined sne  ic are very rare in our sample , contributing only 12% of all ccsne .",
    "this is in agreement with the recent study of arcavi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , who find that broad - lined sne  ic contribute only 1.8% of ccsne in large galaxies .",
    "it is noteworthy , however , that arcavi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) find broad - lined sne  ic to be much more common ( @xmath613% of ccsne ) in low - metallicity dwarf host galaxies .",
    "we also exclude sne occurring in highly inclined galaxies , where dust obscuration may introduce statistical problems that are difficult to correct . as a result of these minor adjustments , made because our goal of investigating implications for massive - star evolution is different from the goal of deriving relative rates and correcting for observational biases , the relative fractions of various sn types in table  1 and",
    "figure  [ fig : pie ] differ slightly from the results in paper  ii .    in quoting fractions of various sn types , we ignore metallicity , galaxy class , and other properties ,",
    "although we are cognizant of the importance of these properties and consider them in our discussion below .",
    "the galaxies included in the loss survey span a range of luminosity , with most of the ccsn hosts corresponding roughly to metallicities of 0.52 @xmath7 ( garnett 2002 ; the loss galaxy sample spans a range of @xmath8 from about @xmath920 to @xmath926 mag , but most of the ccsn hosts are in the range @xmath922 to @xmath925 mag ; see paper  ii ) .",
    "we note some trends in paper  ii , such as the fact that sne  iin appear to prefer lower luminosity spirals , whereas sne  ibc seem to prefer large galaxies and therefore higher metallicity , consistent with previous studies ( prantzos & boissier 2003 ; prieto et al .",
    "2008 ; boissier & prantzos 2009 ) . loss is biased against very faint dwarf galaxies , since larger galaxies with potentially more sne were targeted to yield a richer harvest of sne",
    ". however , low - luminosity galaxies seem to have more than their expected share of star formation per unit mass , and probably contribute 520% of the local star formation ( young et al .  2008 ) . if unusually luminous sne  iin and ii - l favour such low - luminosity galaxies , as some recent studies may imply ( smith et al .",
    "2008 ; miller et al .  2009 ; quimby et al .",
    "2009 ) , then this may slightly raise the relative fractions of sne  iin and ii - l compared to our study .",
    "recently commissioned untargeted surveys can help constrain this contribution ( see arcavi et al .",
    "2010 , as noted above regarding broad - lined sne  ic in dwarf hosts ) .",
    "our volume - limited survey within 60 mpc includes 80 ccsne , compared to the heterogeneous volume - limited study of 92 ccsne within 28 mpc summarised by smartt ( 2009 ) .",
    "however , because the loss survey was conducted with the same telescope in a systematic way , we are able to make proper corrections for the observing biases , as paper ii describes in detail .",
    "we also have much more complete spectroscopic follow - up observations and we monitor the photometric evolution of the sne we discovered , which particularly affects the relative fractions of sn",
    "ii - p vs.  ii - l , iin , and iib , all of which are sometimes called simply `` type ii '' in initial reports .",
    "thus , samples of sne using identifications from initial reports are often unreliable or unspecific , but our study resolves this issue because our more extensive photometric and spectroscopic follow - up observations allow us to more reliably place the sne in subclasses .",
    "consequently , our observed fractions of ccsn types differ from those of previous studies in a few key respects .",
    "the main differences compared to sn fractions listed in various studies reviewed by smartt ( 2009 ) are as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) we find a lower sn  ii - p fraction of only @xmath648 % , in contrast to larger values of 59% in previous studies , although some of these did not differentiate among sn  ii subtypes .",
    "this impacts the `` rsg problem '' as discussed below .",
    "\\(2 ) we find correspondingly larger fractions of sne  ii - l , iin , and iib compared with smartt et al .",
    "this mostly reflects our spectroscopic and photometric follow - up observations mentioned above .",
    "\\(3 ) we find a larger fraction of sne  ibc than cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , although similar to other estimates ( van den bergh et al .",
    "1987 ; prantzos & boissier 2003 ; prieto et al .",
    "2008 ; boissier & prantzos 2009 ; smartt et al .",
    "the number ratio of sne  ibc to all sne  ii that we measure is @xmath10 = 0.35 , whereas cappellaro et al .",
    "found a value for @xmath10 of only 0.29 .",
    "prieto et al.(2008 ) noted that @xmath11 = 0.27 in the full sample they considered , but they also found a metallicity dependence , with higher values comparable to ours at around solar metallicity .",
    "the high ratio we find is the crux of the `` wr problem '' that we discuss herein .",
    "the imf describes the relative number of stars as a function of initial mass , @xmath12 , and within a given mass range this dictates the distribution of initial masses for progenitors of sne .",
    "we adopt a simple approximation of the imf as a single power law and exponent @xmath13 given by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is a constant . to understand the implications of sn rates for massive stars , we investigate the imf within a mass range bounded by the lowest initial mass that results in a ccsn , @xmath16 , and extending up to the upper mass limit for the initial masses of stars .",
    "one expects @xmath16 to be around 8 m@xmath1 , but there are uncertainties involved , as discussed further below .",
    "we take the upper limit to initial masses to be 150 m@xmath1 ( figer 2005 ) , although this choice has little effect on our analysis because the most massive stars are so rare in the local universe ( all the stars from 100 to 150 m@xmath1 make up less than 2% of the population , comparable to our uncertainties ) .",
    "a handy quantity is @xmath17 , which we define as the fraction of all ccsne contributed by stars with initial mass @xmath18 or higher , up to 150  m@xmath1 . for an unbroken power - law imf ,",
    "this is given by    @xmath19}{[1-(m_{\\rm sn}/150)^{\\gamma+1 } ] } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 = @xmath92.35 for a standard salpeter ( 1955 ) mass function ( note that this differs from the logarithmic form that is sometimes used , where salpeter corresponds to @xmath201.35 ) .",
    "bastian et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have provided a recent review of the literature on possible variations in the imf , and conclude that there is no clear evidence that the imf varies strongly in the modern universe .",
    "clearly , @xmath21 is the cumulative fraction contributed by stars between the lower bound ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath18 .",
    "this assumes that sn progenitors occupy the full mass range from @xmath16 to 150 m@xmath1 , with no large mass interval where stars consistently collapse directly to a black hole without any visual display ( fryer 1999 ) ; the latter remains a possibility , and implications are discussed later .",
    "figures  [ fig : fm2 ] and [ fig : fm ] show plots of @xmath21 and @xmath17 , respectively , for three different representative values of @xmath16 = 8.0 , 8.5 , and 9.0 m@xmath1 , as well as for two different values of @xmath13 = 2.35 ( salpeter 1955 ) or 2.4 ( e.g. , humphreys & mcelroy 1984 ) for comparison .",
    "one can see that small variations in @xmath13 have little effect on the results .",
    "figure  [ fig : fm2 ] also illustrates a hypothetical case of @xmath13 = @xmath91.8 , which is large enough to make a substantial difference ( this is the slope that would be needed to reconcile the disagreement between the observed fraction of sne  ii - p and the observed mass range for the corresponding progenitors ; see below ) .",
    "this slope , however , is more top - heavy than allowed by measurements of local stellar populations outside of the inner parts of the densest star clusters ( see bastian et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "small differences in the adopted value of @xmath16 can have a substantial effect , however .",
    "this is due to the fact that lower - mass stars are so much more numerous in a bottom - heavy imf , and small changes in @xmath16 therefore have a disproportionate influence on the distribution of sn types .",
    "this is relevant in regard to the still - uncertain lower bound to initial masses that experience fe core collapse and those that may suffer less energetic explosions via electron - capture sne ( ecsne ) . according to smartt ( 2009 ) ,",
    "directly observed rsg progenitors of normal sne  ii - p extend down to around 8 m@xmath1 and their statistical distribution favours @xmath22 m@xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "theories for ecsne predict that these explosions occur somewhere in the range 811 m@xmath1 depending on assumptions about metallicity , mass loss , and other factors ( nomoto 1984 ; woosley et al .",
    "2002 ; kitaura et al.2006 ; wanajo et al .  2009 ; pumo et al .",
    "theory generally predicts that if ecsne occur within this range , they would tend to be less energetic and fainter than a standard fe ccsn , releasing @xmath610@xmath23 erg of kinetic energy ( instead of @xmath610@xmath24 erg ) and producing less @xmath25ni than standard ccsne .",
    "it has been hypothesised that an ecsn may have given birth to the crab nebula ( davidson et al .",
    "1982 ; nomoto 1984 ; kitaura et al .  2006 ; wanajo et al .  2009 ) .",
    "a note of caution is that if the corresponding observed visual displays are indeed much fainter than normal ccsne , then it is possible that some of these ecsne may not be included in the loss sample , since we chose to exclude faint type  iin events such as sn impostors , @xmath26  car analogs , lbvs , or other peculiar faint transients in the observed fractions of ccsne ( paper ii ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if ecsne do not give rise to these sn impostors , but appear instead as the relatively faint end of the distribution of sne  ii - p ( objects like sn  2005cs ; pastorello et al .",
    "2007 ) , then they will be included in the loss rates as sne  ii - p . the luminosity functions in paper",
    "ii reveal an enhancement at the very bottom of the luminosity range of sne ii - p .",
    "this uncertainty is unfortunate , but the ecsn phenomenon is not understood sufficiently well to confidently account for it . for this reason , figures  [ fig : fm2 ] and [ fig : fm ] show values for @xmath16 of 8.0 , 8.5 , and 9.0 m@xmath1 and the range of uncertainty that this introduces .",
    "independent of the questions surrounding ecsn theory , however , an empirical value of @xmath16 = 8.0@xmath271.0 m@xmath1 is favoured by smartt ( 2009 ) based on the distribution of masses for directly observed sn  ii - p progenitors ( although one must remember that this value is model dependent as well , and subject to systematic effects ; see smartt 2009 for details ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath16 = 8.5 m@xmath1 for most discussion in this work .",
    "if the ecsn phenomenon occurs above 8.5 m@xmath1 , we consider it likely that those ecsne will be included among the population of faint sne  ii - p anyway , while those below could be excluded if they masquerade as faint transients or sn impostors ( e.g. , thompson et al .  2009 ) .    .",
    "this is a cumulative distribution function beginning at the bottom of the mass range for ccsne ( @xmath16 ) , showing the fraction of ccsne contributed by stars in the mass range from @xmath16 up to @xmath18 .",
    "the three solid black curves are for three example values of @xmath16 = 8.0 , 8.5 , and 9.0 m@xmath1 using a salpeter slope of @xmath13 = @xmath92.35 .",
    "the dotted curves are for @xmath13 = @xmath92.4 , whereas the grey dot - dashed curve illustrates the hypothetical top - heavy case of @xmath13 = 1.8 ( see text ) . the long - dashed curve labeled",
    "`` 74% '' shows the same function for @xmath16 = 8.5 m@xmath1 and @xmath13 = 2.35 , but it excludes 26% of the total number ( 26% is the sum of the fractions of all sne  ibc ) , assuming that they follow a different evolutionary path in close binaries over the full mass range considered ; this possibility is discussed later in  4.2 and 4.3 .",
    "the gray box denotes the range of uncertainty in the upper bound to rsg progenitors of sne  ii - p , based on the properties of progenitors detected so far ( smartt et al .",
    "the horizontal line is the observed fraction of sne  ii - p.,width=288 ]      red supergiants ( rsgs ) represent the expected endpoint of post - main - sequence stellar evolution for the majority of single stars with initial masses above 8 m@xmath1 , and it is straightforward to associate their extended h - rich envelopes with sne  ii - p  the most common type of ccsn .",
    "this has long been expected ( e.g. , falk & arnett 1977 ; litvinova & nadyozhin 1983 ; doggett & branch 1985 ; wheeler & swartz 1993 ) , but the rsg / ii - p connection has received firm footing in the past decade with the identification of rsgs as the progenitor stars of several sne  ii - p .",
    "this work has been based on attempting to locate progenitor stars ( or upper limits to them ) in pre - explosion archival data at the same position as the sn ( barth et al .",
    "1996 ; van dyk et al .  1999 , 2003a , 2003b , 2003c ; smartt et al .  2001 , 2002 , 2003 , 2004 ;",
    "li et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 , 2007 ; maund & smartt 2005 ) , and in some cases the rsg disappears after the sn has faded .",
    "these multiple progenitor studies have reassured us that rsgs are the progenitors of sne  ii - p , but what range of initial masses do they imply ?",
    "there are many potential systematic errors involved : masses derived from progenitor luminosities rely upon model - dependent evolutionary tracks , and circumstellar dust that may have surrounded the progenitor could have been vaporised by the sn , causing the extinction derived toward the sn progenitor  and therefore its luminosity and mass  to be underestimated .",
    "smartt ( 2009 ) has reviewed the recent literature on the identification of sn  ii - p progenitors as rsgs in pre - explosion data and discussed these systematics .",
    "altogether , smartt ( 2009 ) argues that the available collection of sn ii - p progenitor detections and upper limits favours 8.516.5 m@xmath1 for the range of initial masses , adopting a normal salpeter imf , and smartt et al .",
    "( 2009 ) give an upper limit to initial masses of sn ii - p progenitors of 21 m@xmath1 with 95% confidence . the upper limit in the range of 16.5 to 21 m@xmath1",
    "is shown by the gray shaded area in figure  [ fig : fm2 ] .    in our volume - limited sample of sne",
    ", we find that sne  ii - p constitute about 48% of ccsne ( figure  [ fig : pie ] ) .",
    "this is a lower fraction than reported in previous studies ( smartt 2009 ; smartt et al .  2009 ;",
    "note that several other previous studies did not explicitly separate sne  ii - p from ii - l or other sne  ii ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fm2 ] compares this loss observed fraction of sne  ii - p , @xmath28 , to the quantity @xmath21 ( see eqn .",
    "3 ) , which is the fraction of ccsne one expects integrating from the bottom of the ccsn range at @xmath16 = 8.0 , 8.5 , or 9.0 m@xmath1 up to mass @xmath18 .    from figure  [ fig : fm2 ] we see that the initial mass range of 8.516.5 m@xmath1 over which rsg progenitors of sne  ii - p have been identified would provide more than enough sne to account for the observed fraction of sne ii - p , under the assumption that all stars within this mass range explode as sne  ii - p .",
    "in fact , stars in the initial mass range 8.516.5 m@xmath1 would constitute roughly 62% of all the stars above 8.5 m@xmath1 ( for @xmath13 = @xmath92.35 ) that undergo core collapse , producing _ too many _",
    "sne  ii - p .",
    "the mass range 8.513.7 m@xmath1 would be sufficient to produce the observed fraction of sn ii - p .",
    "thus , there is apparently no rsg problem from the `` supply - side '' point of view , in the sense that the observed range of masses for sn  ii - p progenitors supplies a _",
    "large enough _ fraction of ccsne . looking more closely",
    ", however , there is a `` demand - side '' problem in the sense that stars in the initial mass range of 817 m@xmath1  which are in fact observed to explode as sne  ii - p  produce _ too many _",
    "sne  ii - p compared to the observed fraction of this sn subtype .",
    "smartt et al .",

    "smith & owocki ( 2006 ) have discussed this , pointing out that giant lbv - like eruptions may provide a way to make up the deficit , but the mass range over which this applies is uncertain ; eruptive mass loss is probably dominant in only the most massive stars .",

    "in other words , the wr problem can be stated simply as    @xmath39    according to figure  [ fig : fm ] , roughly half the sn  ibc population must originate from stars that are less massive than initial masses corresponding to the observed or theoretically expected population of wr stars .",
    "there are several possible solutions to this problem .",
    "( 1 ) the wr phase for many lower - mass stars is not observed because it is extremely short - lived , perhaps because eruptions in late evolutionary phases remove the remaining h envelope even down to lower masses than we normally associate with lbvs . in this case , however , some sne  ibc should show signs of interaction with h - rich csm at late times , because that h must have been shed recently , while only a few do .",
    "sn  2001em is one example ( chugai & chevalier 2006 ; schinzel et al.2009 ; van dyk et al .",
    "2009 ) , but perhaps there are more where the csm interaction is missed at very late times .",
    "( 2 ) alternatively , the population of h - free stars that correspond to the progenitors of almost half of sne  ibc may be underluminous because of significant mass loss in binary rlof .",
    "if underluminous , their radiation - driven winds  and hence , their emission - line spectra  may be weak and so they are not discovered or identified observationally as classical wr stars .",
    "these may be hidden by brighter companion stars in binary systems ( i.e. the overluminous mass gainers ) , making them more difficult to observe .",
    "smartt ( 2009 ) mentioned this as a potential explanation for the lack of any detection of sn  ibc progenitors so far .",
    "the idea that rlof dominates the population of sn  ibc progenitors was suggested long ago ( e.g. , filippenko 1991 ; branch , nomoto , & filippenko 1991 ; podsiadlowski et al .",
    "1992 ) but has been hard to confirm .",
    "we find , as discussed further below , that _ this is the likely origin of at least half and possibly most sne  ibc_.    this is not to say that the expectations of single - star evolution are completely irrelevant . while binary rlof may be largely independent of metallicity and initial mass , stellar winds may still play an important role .",
    "rlof in binaries provides a likely way to strip the h envelopes at any metallicity , but it is less likely to strip the he envelope except for the shortest - period systems .",
    "the same goes for shedding the h envelope via giant lbv - like eruptions , which may also be insensitive to metallicity ( smith & owocki 2006 ) .",
    "however , the _ subsequent _ evolution of the stripped he core  from one with a small residual h mass to a h - free and he - rich surface , and eventually toward removal of the he layer as well  can be accomplished by the line - driven wind of the wr star itself , _ which does depend strongly on both metallicity and luminosity ( and therefore initial mass)_. this is supported by the observation that the ratio of wn stars to wc stars varies from @xmath61 in the milky way to 5 and 10 in the lmc and smc , respectively ( e.g. , crowther 2009 ) .",
    "even as binaries , some of the sne  ibc  in particular the sne  ic  may therefore appear to obey expected trends of single - star evolution , where the most luminous and higher metallicity stars are more able to shed their he envelopes via radiation - driven winds or eruptions , leading to wc stars and sne  ic .",
    "this may explain why studies of the positions of wr stars and sne in their host galaxies find that wc stars and sne  ic seem to imply higher initial mass and higher metallicity environments ( kelly et al .  2008 ; anderson & james 2009 ; leloudas et al .  2010 ; see also papers i , ii , and iii ) , even if binary evolution or lbv eruptions dominate the removal of the h envelope .",
    "we emphasise that it will be quite important in future studies to distinguish between sne  ib and ic while studying sn statistics as functions of metallicity and redshift . by the same token",
    ", it may be important to distinguish among subtypes of sne  ii , as discussed next .          at odds with the standard scenario for the formation of wr stars as the descendants of the most massive stars with @xmath40",
    "is the uncertain fate of lbvs and their connections to sne . in this standard scenario ( e.g. , conti 1976 ) , winds of o - type stars on the main sequence shed much of the h envelope , leaving a very brief ( @xmath610@xmath41 yr ) transitional lbv stage at the end of core - h burning that finishes the job of forming h - free wr stars .",
    "recent work ( bouret et al .  2005 ; fullerton et al .",
    "2006 ; puls et al .  2006 ) has demonstrated that o - star winds are clumped and that their mass - loss rates are too weak , so it appears likely that lbv giant eruptions must dominate this mass loss if wr stars are to form via single - star evolution ( smith & owocki 2006 ) .",
    "if these eruptions are not strong enough , the star will fail to shed much of its h envelope before core collapse , producing a sn  iin ( smith & owocki 2006 ) .",
    "in fact , recent studies have provided mounting evidence that some lbvs explode as sne before the stars are able to fully shed their h envelopes .",
    "luminous sne  iin , which are thought to be powered by shock interaction with dense csm , require large masses of material ejected in sudden eruptions that occur within decades before core collapse , in some cases as high as 1020 m@xmath1 ( chugai et al .",

    "the large csm masses for luminous events like sn  2006tf and sn  2006gy require very massive progenitor stars to account for the mass budget , since the large ejecta mass corresponds only to the h - rich envelope ejected just before core collapse ( i.e. , the true initial mass of the star also includes the he core and any mass shed during the star s lifetime ) .",
    "one of the hypotheses for the pre - sn mass ejections of sne  iin is that they suffered pulsational pair instability ejections before core collapse , in which case _ very _ massive progenitor stars with @xmath42 are needed ( heger et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "there are other , anecdotal signs of a link between lbvs and sne iin as well , having to do with their wind speeds , absorption profiles , and circumstellar nebulae ( kotak & vink 2006 ; smith 2007 ; trundle et al .",
    "much more directly , gal - yam & leonard ( 2009 ) showed that the lbv - like progenitor of the sn  iin 2005gl subsequently disappeared , providing a strong case that lbvs do in some cases explode as sne  iin , despite that fact that no contemporary stellar evolution models predict this .",
    "gal - yam & leonard inferred a high initial mass of @xmath4350 m@xmath1 for the progenitor of sn  2005gl .",
    "the `` lbv problem , '' then , is the fact that lbvs or some other very massive , unstable h - rich stars explode as sne  iin , even though current models expect very massive stars to shed their h envelopes .",

    "we also mention a compromise `` hybrid '' scenario .",
    "our analysis is intended to guide intuition in future studies , and to provide tests for single / binary - star population synthesis models .",
    "we first consider the familiar hypothesis that at a given metallicity , increasingly more massive and more luminous stars have monotonically increasing mass - loss rates , such that higher initial masses invariably lead to greater stripping of the h and he envelopes .",
    "it is essentially a hypothesis that single - star mass loss dominates over close binary interactions in stripping a massive star s envelope , thereby determining the distribution of sn types .",
    "this is widely considered to be the `` standard '' view of mass loss connecting stellar initial masses to their ultimate fates as a function of metallicity ( e.g. , heger et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this picture",
    ", the most massive stars fully shed their h envelopes by virtue of their own strong winds or lbv - like eruptions to produce sne  ibc . at intermediate masses",
    ", stars do not fully shed their h envelopes , instead producing sne  iin , iib , and ii - l , depending on how much h mass was lost , and how recently this occurred ( i.e. , the density of the immediate csm ) .",
    "the lowest mass range corresponds to rsgs that do not shed their h envelopes and produce sne  ii - p .",
    "figure  [ fig : imfs ] shows how the imf would need to be subdivided in this hypothetical single - star framework , dictated by the observed fractions of various sne types determined by loss ( figure  [ fig : pie ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : imfs ] is largely a more succinct restatement , in graphical form , of the discussion above concerning inconsistencies with rsgs , wr stars , and lbv progenitors .",
    "while in principle this scenario is consistent with the qualitative expectation that more massive stars have stronger pre - sn mass loss , it also comes with many inconsistencies , and conflicts with several observational constraints on the likely progenitors of various sn types .",
    "some obvious problems evident from figure  [ fig : imfs ] are the following :    \\(1 ) the mass range occupied by the observed fraction of sne  ii - p ( 8.513.7 m@xmath1 ) is too small compared to the directly observed mass range of sne  ii - p progenitors , 8.517 m@xmath1 or more ( smartt 2009 ) .",
    "in other words , if all stars in the range 8.517 m@xmath1 produced sne  ii - p , then the fraction of ccsne that are ii - p would be much higher than observed .",
    "\\(2 ) this scenario contradicts the observational indication that some sne  iin have very massive lbv - like progenitors , as discussed above .",
    "a few sne  iin appear to have progenitors with initial masses of at least 5080 m@xmath1 , whereas figure  [ fig : imfs ] requires that no stars above 22 m@xmath1 retain any h envelopes at core collapse .",
    "\\(3 ) similarly , recent identifications of yellow supergiants as sne  ii - l progenitors place them at the upper extreme of the range allowed for sne  ii , or even above 22 m@xmath1 .",
    "masses inferred for the sne  ii - l 2009kr and 2009hd are 1824 m@xmath1 and 2025 m@xmath1 , respectively ( elias - rosa et al .",
    "2010b ; 2010c ) .",
    "\\(4 ) most importantly , there are far too many observed sne  ibc , requiring that all stars above 22 m@xmath1 completely shed their h envelopes , whereas the expected value @xmath31 is roughly 35 m@xmath1 . even at solar metallicity , stars below @xmath31 do not have sufficiently high mass - loss rates to shed their h envelopes  certainly not through metallicity line - driven winds or rsg winds , and probably not through lbv eruptions either .",
    "the known initial mass range for most nearby wr stars accounts for only half the sn  ibc population .",
    "we regard this disagreement as strong evidence that standard single - star evolution with mass loss simply can not account for the observed distribution of sne types , and that binary rlof is therefore needed to account for at least half of the sn  ib / ic population , possibly most of it ( this is the next case discussed below ) .    introducing the hypothesis that some stars collapse directly to bhs without making a visible sn does not help .",
    "if we assume that the most massive stars collapse to bhs ( with @xmath4440 m@xmath1 , for example ; fryer 1999 ) , then it pushes the dividing mass between sne  ii and sne  ibc to even lower values , making the problem worse .",
    "it would also push the upper mass for sn  ii - p progenitors even lower , causing an even worse discrepancy with direct progenitor mass estimates .",
    "a partial solution relying on bhs would require a finely tuned or carefully chosen set of intermediate mass ranges for bhs , but it is still unsatisfying ( i.e. , assuming that stars of , say , 20 - 30 m@xmath1 initial mass collapse to bhs could bring the mass range of sne  ibc into better agreement with @xmath31 , but it would worsen the problem in points 1 - 3 above ) .",
    "direct sn - less collapse to a bh may nevertheless be a possibility .",
    "better constraints on the disappearance of stars without sne are needed ( e.g. , kochanek et al.2008 ) .",
    "an alternative to single - star mass loss is that mass ejection or mass transfer via rlof in interacting binaries plays a dominant role in stripping away the h envelope for a significant fraction of sn progenitors .",
    "this binary hypothesis for explaining wr stars and sne  ibc has been around longer ( paczyski 1967 ) than the idea that stellar winds of single stars remove the h envelope ( conti 1976 ) .",
    "several studies of the effects of binary rlof on massive star evolution have been conducted ( e.g. , podsiadlowski et al .",

    "; eldridge et al.2008 ) .",

    "we argue here that low mass - loss rates of single stars combined with the large sn  ibc fraction now _ demand _ that binary rlof plays a dominant role for a large fraction of sne  ibc .",

    "\\(1 ) the initial mass range of 8.518 m@xmath1 occupied by the @xmath648% of ccsne that are sne  ii - p is now in much better agreement with the inferred mass range of rsg progenitors ( smartt 2009 ) .",

    "\\(3 ) by redistributing the remaining sne  ii over all initial masses , this scenario allows for sne  iin to be associated with the most massive stars , consistent with their presumed massive lbv progenitors , and with the pulsational pair instability in the most extreme cases .",
    "this scenario also has the appealing characteristic that the h - rich sequence ii - p @xmath45 ii - l / iib @xmath45 iin corresponds to a sequence of single progenitors with increasing mass - loss rate , and hence sne with increasing csm interaction .",
    "\\(4 ) owing to the fact that sne  ib are relatively rare , the mass range of sne  ib ( including sne  ibc - pec ) is surprisingly narrow and low , at only 8.512.4 m@xmath1 , if they occupy lower masses than sne  ic within the binary zone in figure  [ fig : imfb1 ] .",
    "there are currently no direct detections of sn  ib progenitors .",
    "a potential objection to this simple binary scenario is that the fraction of sne  ibc compared to sne  ii is observed to be metallicity dependent ( prantzos & boissier 2003 ; prieto et al .",
    "2008 ; boissier & prantzos 2009 ; papers i , ii , and iii ) , as are different wr subtypes ( crowther 2007 ) , and that sne  ic are thought to be associated with massive stars and higher metallicity because of their specific locations in galaxies ( kelly et al .  2008",
    "; anderson & james 2009 ; papers i and ii ) .",
    "however , this may still be true even in the simple binary scenario .",
    "binary rlof is only effective at removing the h envelope in most cases , leaving the he core exposed .",
    "more massive and luminous stars will have stronger winds with higher radiation - driven mass - loss rates , which will dominate the _",
    "subsequent _ evolution .",
    "consequently , only more massive stars ( or perhaps the closest binaries ) experience further significant mass stripping , driving evolution from wn to wc to produce sne  ic rather than sne  ib .",
    "a corollary is that line - driven winds of wr stars are metallicity dependent , so while removal of the h envelope ( either by rlof or lbv - type eruptions ) is insensitive to metallicity , the further evolution from wn to wc ( and hence , the production of sne  ic ) will be highly dependent on metallicity .",
    "one last complication is that this scenario places sne  iib as single stars and sne  ib as binaries .",
    "this leaves us without a satisfying explanation as to why such a tiny difference in surface h mass separates sne  iib and sne  ib ( e.g. , chornock et al .",
    "2010 ; elmhamdi et al .",
    "2006 ; filippenko et al .",
    "1994 ) , which otherwise look extremely similar , and it ignores observational results suggesting that the progenitor of the nearby type  iib sn  1993j was most likely a binary system ( aldering et al .",
    "1994 ; maund et al .  2004",
    "; maund & smartt 2009 ) .",
    "there is also evidence for binarity in the case of sn  2001ig ( ryder et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ; silverman et al .  2009 ; maund et al.2007 ) , which was also type  iib .",
    "these issues motivate the alternative binary scenario discussed next .",
    "the second binary - dominated progenitor scenario that we consider is similar to the first , except that we now include all sne  iib along with sne  ib and ic as stars that lose their h envelopes primarily through binary rlof .",
    "the motivation for this , as explained above , is the close morphological relationship between sne  iib and ib  sne  iib essentially _ are _ type  ib except for a small amount of h at early times  plus the observational evidence of the progenitor of sn  1993j and models for its evolution that are suggestive of a binary system ( podsiadlowski et al .",

    "figure  [ fig : imfb2 ] shows how the imf could be divided according to observed sn fractions if we assume that all `` stripped - envelope sne , '' now including sne  iib along with sne  ibc , arise from binary rlof .",
    "including sne  iib as binary systems has three main consequences compared to the binary # 1 scenario :    \\(1 ) the fraction of all ccsne progenitors that lose their h envelopes through binary rlof is higher , at @xmath637% instead of @xmath626% . note that both cases binary # 1 and # 2 imply rather high binary fractions , as the stripped - envelope progenitors are mainly the mass losers in rlof binary systems , but the implied close binary fraction is within reason ( see kobulnicky & fryer 2008 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) the upper mass bound for sn  ii - p progenitors is shifted to higher masses ( 23.6 m@xmath1 ) .",
    "this upper bound is somewhat troublesome , as it exceeds the 95% confidence upper limit of 21 m@xmath1 derived from the properties of sn  ii - p progenitors ( smartt et al.2009 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) most significantly , the mass range for sne  ib shifts to higher mass progenitors than in the binary # 1 scenario . assuming that progenitors of sne  ib are less massive than sne  ic in the binary # 1 scenario would dictate that sne  ib arise from initial masses of 8.512.4 m@xmath1 ; as noted above , this is low and quite narrow . if we assume the same for the binary # 2 hypothesis , but also add the assumption that sne  iib , in turn , are less massive than sne  ib , then the corresponding ranges of initial masses would be 8.511 m@xmath1 for sne  iib , 1116 m@xmath1 for sne  ib , and @xmath4416 m@xmath1 for sne  ic .",
    "this is an improvement over the binary # 1 scenario in that it pushes the dividing mass between sne  ib and ic to higher masses , although 16 m@xmath1 still seems quite low for wr stars that we expect to shed their own he envelopes via line - driven winds .",
    "this is remedied in the `` hybrid '' scenario discussed next .",
    "an important caveat is that the monotonic transition sne  iib @xmath45 ib @xmath45 ic with increasing initial mass is probably not strict , as it also depends on initial binary separation ( i.e. , very close binaries can remove all of the h and even he layers in rlof ) .",
    "thus , sne  iib could extend to higher masses than 11 m@xmath1 if they arise in relatively wide binaries , for example ( see below ) .    by dividing sn types into two different and distinct channels corresponding to single stars and binaries ,",
    "the binary # 2 hypothesis has the appealing quality that it provides a natural continuity in sn types within each channel , which is lacking otherwise .",
    "with increasing levels of envelope stripping due to rlof followed by wr wind mass loss , the binary channel gives sne  iib @xmath45 ib @xmath45 ic .",
    "there may be a continuum of sn progenitors with different levels of envelope stripping , probably corresponding to increasing initial metallicity or luminosity , such that a small amount of residual h separates sne  iib and ib ( e.g. , elmhamdi et al .  2006 ; chornock et al .",
    "2010 ) , whereas a small difference in he mass may separate sne  ib from ic .        in the binary # 2 hypothesis , there is also now a natural continuity in the single - star channel , giving sne  ii - p @xmath45 ii - l @xmath45 iin with increasing initial mass and pre - sn mass loss , and without the puzzling ambiguity between the origins of sne  iib and ii - l .",
    "the few direct detections of progenitors that are available support the notion that the progenitors of sne  ii - l are more massive than those of sne  ii - p ( elias - rosa et al .  2010b ; 2010c ) , and that progenitors of sne  iin are more massive than sne  ii - l ( gal - yam & leonard 2009 ) . the same is true for levels of csm interaction : sne  ii - p tend to have extremely weak or undetectable csm interaction signatures , sne  ii - l tend to have stronger radio and x - ray emission ( sramek & weiler 1990 ) , and their h@xmath46 profiles with weak p - cygni features are thought to arise from heating of the sn ejecta by csm interaction ( e.g. , chugai 1991 ) .",
    "sne  iin obviously have the strongest levels of csm interaction , but there is wide diversity even among the subclass , with the faintest sne  iin like sn  2005ip looking basically like a sn  ii - l with strong narrow emission lines ( smith et al .",
    "2009b ) , whereas the csm is opaque and qualitatively changes the sn in more luminous sne  iin such as sn  2006tf and sn  2006gy ( smith et al .",
    "the full range for sne  iin ( 34150 m@xmath1 ) encompasses the most luminous rsg that may be responsible for the fainter sne  iin ( smith et al .",
    "2009a ; see also yoon & cantiello 2010 ) , intermediate cases of sne  iin consistent with normal lbvs ( gal - yam & leonard 2009 ) , as well as the most massive stars with violent pre - sn mass loss ( smith et al .",
    "2007 , 2010 ; woosley et al.2007 ) .",
    "if we relax the requirement that all of the most massive single stars make successful sne  iin , then the lower - right corner of figure  [ fig : imfb2 ] provides an attractive parameter space for massive stars that can collapse to a bh without making a sn display . if , for example , we allow all _ single _ stars above 50 m@xmath1 in the binary # 2 scenario to quietly make bhs , then the redistribution of the remaining mass ranges for sne  ii - p , ii - l , and iin are still in rough agreement with observational constraints",
    "of course , this would fail to produce the very luminous sne  iin that are thought to come from the most massive stars .",
    "a drawback of this binary # 2 scenario is that the initial mass range for sne  ic still reaches to uncomfortably low masses , and therefore dominates most of the mass range for binary progenitors .",
    "note that if we allow some of the most massive stars in the binary channel to undergo quiet bh collapse , we would need to shift the boundary between sne  ic and ib to even lower initial masses , exacerbating this problem .",
    "also , the binary # 2 scenario does not allow any sne  ic to come from single stars , and begs the question of the origin and fate of single wr stars , which presumably arise from eruptive lbv mass loss in very massive stars or perhaps through strong winds at super - solar metallicity .",
    "the next scenario allows some of the most massive single stars to produce sne  ic as well .",
    "one can , of course , play this game _ ad nauseum _ by adjusting the fraction of sn progenitors that experience binary rlof , and redistributing the remainder among single stars in various ways .",
    "figure  [ fig : imfh ] shows an example of one `` hybrid '' scenario , which is a compromise between the standard view of single - star evolution and the binary # 2 scenario . here we have assumed that roughly half of the sn  ic population ( we take a fraction equal to 8.8% of all ccsne for convenience , equal to the sne  iin fraction ) may arise from single - star evolution , while the remainder of sne  ic form via binary rlof along with sne  ib ( including ibc - pec ) and sne  iib as before , so that the binary rlof fraction is 28% in this hypothetical scenario",
    ". the binary fraction may be somewhat different or may be mass dependent , and one can adjust a version of figure  [ fig : imfh ] accordingly to match precise values ; the goal here is to be conceptual .",
    "although such a scenario may seem more complicated and somewhat _ ad hoc _ , it is well motivated , and balances several competing factors . among the most massive stars with initial masses above 23 m@xmath1",
    ", it allows single stars to die as _ either _ sne  ic or iin .",
    "this may be the case if the efficiency of single - star mass loss depends on additional factors such as rotation or metallicity .",
    "one can imagine , for example , that very massive stars may be unable to shed their h envelopes if low metallicity or slower initial rotation rates weaken their winds or tame the lbv instability . under these circumstances , massive stars",
    "might then die as sne  iin if they suffer core collapse while still in the process of attempting to shed their h envelopes .",
    "indeed , we noted in paper  ii that sne  iin tend to prefer smaller , lower metallicity galaxies .",
    "the remainder of more rapidly rotating single stars or higher metallicity single stars might successfully shed their h envelopes via winds or lbv eruptions and die as sne  ic .",
    "lbv eruptions do seem to be more catastrophic among the most massive stars ( smith & owocki 2006 ) .    aside from being hypothetical , this scenario has no obvious disadvantages in view of our knowledge of sn progenitors , and it has some strengths as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) it maintains very good agreement between the mass range of sne  ii - p and the inferred mass range of directly detected rsg progenitors ( smartt 2009 ) .",
    "putting some of the sne  ic back into the single - star channel has the consequence that it lowers the upper mass bound required for sne  ii - p compared to the binary # 2 scenario , improving the agreement with observations .",
    "obviously , we could have chosen the fraction of sne  ic to be a little larger in order to precisely match the upper mass range for sne  ii - p .",
    "\\(2 ) the mass range of sne  ii - l , albeit narrow , is entirely consistent with known progenitors of this class mentioned earlier .",
    "\\(3 ) figure  [ fig : imfh ] allows sne  iin to arise from among the most massive stars , consistent with their hypothesised lbv or pulsational pair instability progenitors .",
    "as in the binary # 1 and # 2 scenarios , it provides for the apparent continuity in pre - sn mass loss from sne  ii - p to ii - l to iin .",
    "the initial mass range of sne  iin progenitors is roughly 23150 m@xmath1 , commensurate with the known initial mass range of lbvs ( smith et al .",
    "we show an alternative version of a hybrid scenario in figure  [ fig : imfh2 ] , wherein we separate sne  iin and single - star sne  ic by mass , instead of dividing them half - and - half across all single - star masses above 23 m@xmath1 .",

    "the wider mass range would allow more diversity in the progenitors of sne  iib , consistent with the expectations of chevalier & soderberg ( 2010 ) .",

    "the initial masses corresponding to sne  ib ( and sne  ibc - pec ) would then be roughly 1225 m@xmath1 .",
    "these are massive stars in binaries whose winds can get rid of the remaining h , but are not strong enough to fully remove the he envelope , probably because they are underluminous after rlof .",

    "there is some empirical support for this ( kelly et al .",

    "\\(8 ) sne  ib are less common and there are fewer well - studied examples compared to sne  ic , but a recent detailed investigation of the sn  ib 2007y revealed a small ejecta mass that suggested a low initial mass of only 1013 m@xmath1 for the progenitor , and interestingly , deduced a progenitor mass - loss rate of only @xmath3410@xmath47 m@xmath1 ( stritzinger et al .",
    "this mass - loss rate derived from radio and x - ray data is quite low compared to mass - loss rates of classical wr stars , supporting the idea that sne  ib arise from lower - mass stars than classical wr stars , and that they have relatively low luminosity and weak winds ( see also filippenko 1991 ) .",
    "it is even possible , for instance , that the wind of the mass - gainer companion ( e.g. , an ob supergiant ) will be stronger than the wind of the sn  ib progenitor star , and that the sn blast wave will interact mostly with its companion s wind .",
    "whether or not the wind is h - poor is difficult to ascertain from radio or x - ray observations , and deriving a progenitor mass - loss rate depends also on an assumed wind velocity ( i.e. , it may be significantly lower for a slow b - supergiant wind than for a fast wr wind ) .",

    "2007 ) may fit in a similar transitional category of very massive stars .",
    "all things considered , we favour a hybrid scenario like figure  [ fig : imfh ] as the basic explanation for the observed fractions of various sn types in large galaxies , invoking binary rlof to account for most sne  iib , ib , and some ic , and yet retaining single - star mass loss with increasing mass to account for sne  ii - p , ii - l , iin , and some ic in the most extreme cases .",
    "we stress , however , that this is hypothetical , with specific binary fractions and other parameters adopted to encapsulate only the broad properties of various sn types .",
    "figure  [ fig : imfh ] adopted a constant fraction of progenitors that go through rlof , whereas this may obviously depend on initial mass , and rlof efficiency may depend on other factors like binary separation and metallicity .",
    "thus , the mass divisions between various types are meant as a general guide , rather than definitive values .",
    "this is certainly an oversimplification , and there may well be exceptions for individual cases or extreme conditions .",
    "more study is needed , including detailed population synthesis models with both binary evolution and lbv - like mass loss for massive stars .",
    "the binary fraction and its variation with initial mass are key parameters , as is the behaviour of wind and eruptive mass loss with metallicity and rotation .",
    "however , we hope that keeping a scenario such as figure  [ fig : imfh ] in mind will be useful to guide intuition for mapping sne to stellar initial masses .",
    "if sne  iib really result from a different channel than other sne  ii , a simple comparison of the relative numbers of sne  ibc and sne  ii ( including sn  iib with other sne  ii ) is probably misleading . such a comparison would make sense in the standard single - star scenario where all stars above some threshold mass , @xmath31 , make wr stars and sne  ibc ( figure  [ fig : imfs ] ) , but we have argued that this simple hypothesis is contradicted by sn observations . instead , an analysis that retains sn types in - line with the separate binary and single - star channels discussed here would be more appropriate .",
    "for example , whereas envelope stripping via binary rlof should not necessarily depend on metallicity or initial mass ( unless the close binary fraction changes with mass ) , the transition sn  iib @xmath45 ib @xmath45 ic is caused directly by the line - driven wind of the post - rlof wr - like star ( i.e. , proceeding from a low - luminosity wn with some h , to a normal wn , to wc ) .",
    "we should therefore be very interested to see how fractions of these _ subtypes _ change with metallicity .",
    "thus , previous studies that have compared the ratio n@xmath48/n@xmath49 , lumping sne  iib together with other sne  ii , may produce somewhat misleading trends and may inspire erroneous conclusions . in future studies ,",
    "as larger numbers of all types of sne become available , it will be useful to compare relative numbers of individual subtypes ( iib : ib : ic ) as well as the ratio of larger groups that represent different channels [ e.g. , ( iib + ib + ic ) / ( ii - p + ii - l + iin ) ] with metallicity and host - galaxy environment .",
    "the properties of sn  ii environments would be particularly interesting ; the binary # 2 or hybrid hypotheses would predict , for example , that sne  iin come from more massive stars and should therefore trace clusters and h  ii regions to a higher degree than sne  ii - p and ii - l . this would not be so noticeable for the single - star scenario shown in figure  [ fig : imfs ] .",
    "we would not necessarily expect , however , that sne  iin would be concentrated in galaxy centers , as that may betray a high - metallicity effect , which leads instead to sne  ic for the most massive stars .",
    "very massive stars that retain their h envelopes until shortly before core collapse might instead favour lower metallicity , and hence smaller host galaxies .",
    "this does indeed seem to be the case , as we point out in paper  ii .",
    "a central hypothesis is that sne  ib trace a population of moderately massive stars that have lost their h envelopes primarily via binary rlof .",
    "these progenitors are like classical wr stars in that they are h deficient , but they differ in that they are likely to be underluminous with relatively weak winds , and stem from a lower range of initial masses of roughly 1225 m@xmath1 .",
    "these may not be recognised as wr stars because of their weaker winds and less prominent emission lines ( see also filippenko 1991 ) . in nearby stellar populations ,",
    "the sn  ib progenitors may be among the group of underluminous early wn stars , or they may reside in binary systems where they are hard to detect next to their overluminous mass - gainer companions .",
    "we have speculated that these post - rlof systems of moderate mass may appear as be or b[e]-like stars , perhaps with asymmetric csm .",
    "other potential sn  ib or ic progenitor systems are famous wr+ob systems like v444 cygni , @xmath50 vel , or ry  sct .",

    ". it will be especially important to further clarify the residual he surface mass that separates sne  ib from ic ; there may obviously be examples of a smooth transition in he mass between them .",
    "if sne  ib arise from rlof in binary systems , then the mass - loss rates of the progenitor stars derived from radio and x - ray observations may be tricky to interpret .",
    "for example , we noted that the wind of the overluminous mass - gainer companion may be stronger than the sn progenitor star itself , and so interaction between the sn blast wave and the companion s wind might dominate the observed radio and x - ray emission . without a radiative shock to produce strong balmer lines",
    ", it would be difficult to determine whether the wind is deficient in hydrogen .",
    "lastly , it would be interesting to further investigate differences among environments and progenitors of sne  ic , since this class alone makes up 15% of all ccsne ( a substantial fraction of the most massive stars ) , and may have multiple progenitor channels .",
    "do the broad - lined sne  ic arise preferentially from one channel ?",
    "this is a key question in regard to the progenitors of long - duration gamma - ray bursts .",
    "we have studied the observed fractions of different sn types from loss , and considered the implications for massive star evolution . assuming a salpeter imf , we have examined what ranges of initial mass are needed to account for the observed fractions of sne  ii - p , ii - l , iin , iib , ib , and ic under various assumptions about the roles of stellar winds and close binary rlof in stellar evolution .",
    "we briefly list the main conclusions here , which apply to stellar evolution in relatively large galaxies .",
    "\\(1 ) a major finding is that the high observed fraction of sne  ibc can not be reconciled with predictions of single - star evolution , where a star s own wind dominates the removal of its h envelope .",
    "the initial - mass range corresponding to the observed population of classical wr stars can only account for about half of the observed sne  ibc , so classical wr stars are not the progenitors of a significant fraction of sne  ibc .",
    "similarly , the initial mass above which single stars are expected to shed their own envelopes provides a vastly insufficient fraction of stripped - envelope progenitors , even with the overly generous mass - loss rates adopted in most stellar evolution models .",
    "\\(2 ) instead , we find it likely that rlof in binary systems is responsible for the stripped - envelope progenitors of most sne  iib and ib , and probably a large fraction of sne  ic as well .",
    "if these are distributed over the full range of masses , then sne  iib and ib probably arise from lower initial masses of 8.525 m@xmath51 , and sne  ic arise from more massive stars with stronger winds .",
    "\\(3 ) even if binary rlof dominates the removal of the h envelope , the further removal of the he layer depends on metallicity - dependent line - driven winds of the wr star , so sne  ic are still expected to favour more luminous stars and higher metallicity environments .",
    "\\(4 ) if the progenitors of sne  ib and iib are not classical wr stars because their initial masses are too low , then what kind of stars are the progenitors ? we conjecture that they are probably underluminous h - poor stars with weak winds that would not necessarily be recognised as wr stars with prominent emission - line spectra .",
    "they may be easily hidden by their overluminous mass - gainer companions , which may in some cases appear as b[e ] supergiants or related stars with asymmetric csm .",
    "if so , one must be cautious when interpreting signatures of the csm interaction in sne  ib , as the emission may in some cases be dominated by sn shock interaction with a companion star s wind .",
    "\\(5 ) if binary rlof is important in producing stripped - envelope progenitors that are a substantial fraction ( 1/4 to 1/3 ) of all sn progenitors , then it would be a mistake to use statistics of sn types or wr / o - star ratios to guide models for single - star evolution .",
    "\\(6 ) after shifting most stripped - envelope progenitors to the binary rlof channel , the progenitors of the remaining sn types ( h - rich single stars , wide binaries , and possibly mass - gainers in rlof binaries ) must be redistributed across the full range of initial masses . in our favoured scenario ( figure  [ fig : imfh ] ) , sne  ii - p correspond to initial masses of roughly 8.518 m@xmath1 , sne  ii - l to 1823 m@xmath1 , and sne  iin to 23150 m@xmath1 .",
    "this produces good agreement with mass ranges inferred from progenitor studies of sne  ii - p , ii - l , and iin . in particular , this allows some sne  iin to arise from among the most massive stars , as suggested by some very luminous sne  iin .",
    "most stellar evolution models fail to account for very massive stars reaching core collapse without shedding their h envelope , but this is an expected outcome of the lower mass - loss rates now dictated by observations .",
    "we also find it likely that some fraction of the most massive single stars shed their h envelopes to produce wr stars and sne  ic , probably due to high metallicity .",
    "this allows for the possibility that sne  iin favour low - metallicity environments .",
    "\\(7 ) we briefly consider the possibility that some massive stars collapse directly to bhs without a visible sn display .",
    "we can rule out this option for the scenario of standard single - star evolution , because it would make all the problems we note with figure  [ fig : imfs ] worse .",
    "we find no empirical support for the argument that the `` rsg problem '' may imply direct sn - less bh formation , because this problem largely goes away with more reliable sn subtype fractions and with the realization that some rsg stars evolve to other types of progenitors before exploding . though we can not rule out the possibility that some massive single stars within a particular mass range suffer quiet collapse to a bh in a binary - dominated scenario , quiet bh collapse is not required to explain the observed relative fractions of ccsne .",
    "we are grateful to the many students , postdocs , and other collaborators who have contributed to the katzman automatic imaging telescope and the lick observatory supernova search over the past two decades .",
    "we thank the lick observatory staff for their assistance with the operation of kait .",

    "<S> we analyse the observed fractions of core - collapse supernova ( sn ) types from the lick observatory sn search ( loss ) , and we discuss the corresponding implications for massive star evolution . for a standard initial mass function , observed fractions of sn types can not be reconciled with the expectations of single - star evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the mass range of wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars that shed their hydrogen envelopes via their own mass loss accounts for less than half of the observed fraction of type  ibc supernovae ( sne  ibc ) . the true progenitors of sne  ibc must extend to a much lower range of initial masses than classical wr stars , and we argue that most sn  ibc and sn  iib progenitors must arise from binary roche - lobe overflow . in this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> sne  ic would still trace higher initial mass and metallicity , because line - driven winds in the wr stage remove the helium layer and propel the transition from sn  ib to ic . </S>",
    "<S> less massive progenitors of sne  ib and iib may not be classical wr stars ; they may be underluminous with weak winds , possibly hidden by overluminous mass - gainer companions that could appear as b[e ] supergiants or related objects having aspherical circumstellar material . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining sn types ( ii - p , ii - l , and iin ) need to be redistributed across the full range of initial masses , so that even some very massive single stars retain h envelopes until explosion . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the possibility of direct collapse to black holes without visible sne , but find this hypothesis difficult to accommodate in most scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> major areas of remaining uncertainty are ( 1 ) the detailed influence of binary separation , rotation , and metallicity , ( 2 ) mass differences in progenitors of sne  iin compared to sne  ii - l and ii - p , and ( 3 ) the fraction of sne  ic arising from single stars with the help of eruptive mass loss , how this depends on metallicity , and how it relates to diversity within the sn  ic subclass . continued studies of progenitor stars and their environments in nearby galaxies , accounting for sn types , may eventually test these ideas .    </S>",
