    "the _ order of diluteness _ can be defined as @xmath15 , and much larger than 1 .",
    "the argument in the paper is valid only for an extremely weakly interacting bose system , and therefore can not be applied to a strongly interacting system such as real liquid @xmath16he .",
    "the transition temperature of the non - interacting homogeneous bose gas in d - dimensions is @xcite t_c^0(d ) = , [ 1 ] where @xmath0 and @xmath17 is the riemann - zeta function .",

    "[ 6 ] the difficulty in finding the @xmath18 comes from a breakdown of perturbation theory at the second order transition temperature . comparing with eq .",
