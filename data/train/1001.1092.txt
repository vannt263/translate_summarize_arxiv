    "the discovery of superconductivity above 50 k in iron pnictides has posed a strong impact in the community of condensed matter physics.@xcite one of the key issues here is about the superconducting pairing mechanism . theoretically it was suggested that the pairing may be established via inter - pocket scattering of electrons between the hole pockets ( around @xmath7 point ) and electron pockets ( around m point ) , leading to the pairing manner of an isotropic gap on each pocket but with opposite signs between them ( the so - called s@xmath8).@xcite meanwhile other models adopt the s@xmath8 pairing gap but assume that the pairing interaction is established via the local magnetic super - exchange.@xcite besides , by varying the height of the pnictogen to the fe planes , it was argued that the pairing symmetry may be switched from s@xmath8 to d - wave pairing,@xcite as corroborated by the data in lafepo where a nodal gap was inferred from the penetration depth measurements.@xcite similarly , experimental results about the pairing symmetry remain highly controversial leaving the perspectives ranging from s@xmath9-wave , to s@xmath8 and to d - wave.@xcite further comprehension to this essential topic is highly desired .    in a superconductor ,",
    "the disorder induced impurity scattering and pair breaking strongly depend on the very details of the pairing gap , therefore it is informative to detect the disorder scattering effect in the superconducting state . according to the anderson s theorem,@xcite in a conventional s - wave superconductor",
    ", nonmagnetic impurities will not lead to apparent pair - breaking effect .",
    "however , a magnetic impurity , owing to the effect of breaking the time reversal symmetry , can break cooper pairs easily . in sharp contrast , in a d - wave superconductor , nonmagnetic impurities can significantly alter the pairing interaction and induce a high density of states ( dos ) due to the sign change of the gap on a fermi surface .",
    "this was indeed observed in cuprate superconductors where zn - doping induces t@xmath10-suppression as strong as other magnetic disorders , such as mn and ni.@xcite as for the pairing through exchanging the af spin fluctuations between different fermi pockets with the s@xmath8 pairing , it has been pointed out that nonmagnetic impurities could severely suppress @xmath11 and the gap.@xcite in this paper , we report the doping effect of mn and zn to the fe sites of superconductor ba@xmath0k@xmath0fe@xmath1as@xmath1 .",
    "we found that the mn - doping ( leading to the magnetic impurities ) depresses t@xmath10 drastically , while the impurity scattering and suppression to t@xmath10 by zn - doping ( nonmagnetic scattering centers ) is negligible .",
    "the contrasting impurity scattering effects as revealed by our results need to be reconciled with the theoretical expectations of the picture of inter - pocket scattering via exchanging af spin fluctuations .",
    "the mn - doped and zn - doped polycrystalline samples ba@xmath0k@xmath0(fe@xmath12tm@xmath13)@xmath1as@xmath1 ( tm = mn and zn ) were fabricated by solid state reaction method@xcite .",
    "powders k@xmath14as , feas , baas , znas and mnas were prepared previously as precursors .",
    "the samples with different doping concentrations were pressed into pellets under the same pressure , wrapped in ta foils and sintered under exactly the same conditions to eliminate the possible errors in the sample - making process . the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurement",
    "was performed using an mxp18a - hf - type diffractometer with cu - k@xmath15 radiation .",
    "the analysis of x - ray diffraction data was done by using the softwares powder - x and fullprof , the obtained results are consistent with each other .",
    "the compositions of the samples were examined by scanning electron microscopy ( sem , hitachi s-4200 ) and the energy dispersive x - ray analysis ( edx , oxford-6566 ) .",
    "the ac susceptibility measurements were carried out through an oxford cryogenic system maglab - exa-12 .",
    "the resistivity , magnetoresistance and hall effect were measured with a quantum design instrument physical property measurement system ( ppms ) , and the dc magnetization by a quantum design instrument squid ( mpms-7 ) .",

    "in fig.1(a ) , we show the temperature dependence of resistivity of the mn - doped samples ba@xmath0k@xmath0(fe@xmath12mn@xmath13)@xmath1as@xmath1 .",
    "one can see that the superconducting transition temperature was suppressed quickly upon the doping of mn , and the superconductivity vanishes in the sample with x = 0.08 . in contrast , as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , the zn - doped sample does not exhibit a clear change of t@xmath10 with the nominal doping concentration as high as x = 0.10 .",
    "the zn - doping effect in the iron pnictide has been under a heavy debate .",
    "it was found by li et al.@xcite that the zn - doping to the fe sites in lafeaso does not change t@xmath10 clearly .",
    "however , also in the zn - doped but high pressure synthesized lafeaso samples , guo et al.@xcite found that the superconductivity can be destroyed completely at a very low doping level of 2% .",
    "actually in our zn - doped ba-122 samples , the slight change of t@xmath10 in the samples with different zn concentrations may be attributed to the random scattering of t@xmath10 values induced in the synthesizing process .",
    "the temperature dependence of ac susceptibilities for the mn - doped and zn - doped samples are shown in fig.2(a ) and fig.2(b ) , respectively .",
    "for mn - doped ones , the suppression of @xmath11 is remarkable . the sample with x",
    "= 0.08 does not show diamagnetism down to 2 k. this is consistent with the resistivity data .",
    "for zn - doped ones , however , there are not much differences in the values of @xmath11 for different doping levels ( x = 0 to 0.1 ) .      in order to know whether the zn - impurities are really introduced into the lattice",
    ", we have carried out detailed analysis on the compositions of the grains in each sample using the edx analysis .",
    "the undoped sample ba@xmath0k@xmath0fe@xmath1as@xmath1 exhibits superconductivity at about @xmath11 = 35 k , combining with the lattice constants@xcite , we conclude that our sample is slightly overdoped .",
    "the edx data reveals that the actual doping levels of mn is very close to the nominal composition up to 8% , while zn doping has a nonlinear ratio between the really measured composition and the nominal one : 3.1 @xmath17 0.3 @xmath18 in sample x = 0.04 , about 4.5 @xmath17 0.5 @xmath18 in the one x = 0.10 .",
    "we randomly selected 10 typical grains and analyzed the compositions on them.taking the sample with nominal zn=10% as an example , the sem image and edx analysis process were shown in fig.4 and table i. this fact indicates that the zn impurities have been successfully doped into the lattice , although the measured composition is lower than the nominal one .",
    "above discussion can be corroborated by the characterization of the xrd data .",
    "the xrd patterns for all samples were shown in fig.3(a ) and fig.3(b ) .",
    "for mn - doped ones , one can see that the phase is rather clean and no impurities could be detected up to x=0.08 .",
    "the lattice constants of a - axis and the cell volume increase monotonically with doping of mn ( as shown in fig.3(c ) ) , which indicates that the mn atoms were successfully introduced into the lattice . assuming that the mn ionic state is `` + 2 '' , since the ionic radius of mn@xmath19 ( 0.8 @xmath20 ) is bigger than that of fe@xmath19 ( 0.74 @xmath20 ) , it is understandable that the in - plane lattice constant expands and the unit cell volume increases about 1.6% . while for zn - doped samples , since the ionic radius for fe@xmath19 and zn@xmath19 are both 0.74 @xmath20 , therefore the distortion is much smaller , as evidenced by the slight increase of the unit cell volume ( 0.34% ) . in both systems",

    "slight impurity phase emerges when the nominal doping composition goes up to 8% .",
    "( c ) and ( d ) show that the doping dependence of the a - axis and c - axis lattice constants , as well as the volume of unit cell .",

    "one can see that by doping more mn into the system the positive hall coefficient r@xmath22 becomes smaller , indicating the doping of holes into the system . while zn - doping does not change the hall coefficient too much .",

    "the suppression to t@xmath10 in mn - doped samples is drastic , but that by zn - doping is negligible .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath4 is much weaker in the zn - doped sample as compared with the mn - doped one .",
    "the blue dashed line indicates the t@xmath10-drop for the zn - doped samples if we adopt the simple relation @xmath23 and taking the same suppression rate of the mn - doped system.,width=302 ]      it order to know what has been carried out microscopically through doping mn and zn in our samples , we measured the hall coefficient @xmath24 , magnetoresistance ( mr ) and dc magnetization .",
    "as shown in fig.5(a ) , @xmath24 is positive in the undoped sample , indicating hole dominant conduction in ba@xmath0k@xmath0fe@xmath25as@xmath25 . as we dope mn into the sample and keep increasing the doped content , the r@xmath22 reduces systematically",
    "this can be explained by introducing more holes into the system through mn - doping , though complexity will be brought in understanding the hall data of the multiband system.@xcite actually doping mn induces similar effect as doping cr.@xcite the temperature dependence of r@xmath22 is also shown for the zn doped sample ( x=0.06 , 0.08 ) in fig .",
    "one can see that the data of zn - doped sample overlap roughly with the undoped one in a broad temperature region , indicating that the zn@xmath19 is almost identical to fe@xmath19 in donating electrons .",
    "fig.5(b ) presents the mr of the mn - doped sample with x = 0.08 , a clear negative mr effect was observed at low temperatures .",
    "this negative mr can be easily understood as due to the enhanced electron - spin scattering : doping mn induces more and more magnetic centers which have stronger magnetic moment compared to that of fe@xmath19 .",
    "this argument is supported by the enhanced magnetic susceptibility in the mn - doped samples . as shown in the inset of fig.5(b ) , the temperature dependence of dc magnetization of the mn - doped sample can be described nicely by the curie - weiss law @xmath26 ) with @xmath27 , yielding @xmath28 = 0.482 @xmath6/(fe ) in the undoped sample , 0.645 @xmath6/(fe+mn ) in the mn - doped ( x=0.08 ) sample , 0.362 @xmath6/(fe+zn ) in the zn - doped ( x=0.04 ) sample . assuming that each fe - site has also 0.482 @xmath6 in the mn - doped sample , then each mn - site contributes about 2.58 @xmath6 .",
    "zn - doped sample naturally lowers down the paramagnetic susceptibility , suggesting that nonmagnetic impurities have been formed .",
    "although it is still under debate whether the af order is due to the localized moment or itinerant electrons , it is qualitatively correct to make an assessment that the increase of the value of constant `` @xmath29 '' in the curie - weiss law could be attributed to the enhancement of local magnetic moments upon mn - doping , this argument is also consistent with the negative magnetoresistivity data ( kondo - like scattering ) .",
    "finally we summarize the main results in fig.6 . for mn - doped samples , as the doping concentration increases , @xmath11 decreases quickly with a rate of @xmath2/mn-@xmath3 = - 4.2 k , while for the zn - doped samples the variation of @xmath11 is rather small which could be termed as negligible . according to the abrikosov - gorkov formula,@xcite",
    "if the impurities act as strong pair breakers , the t@xmath10 suppression due to pair breaking is essentially related to the impurity scattering rate @xmath30 , where @xmath4 is the residual resistivity and can be roughly expressed as @xmath31 in the single band description with @xmath32 the charge carrier density , @xmath33 the effective mass .",
    "therefore we present also the doping dependence of @xmath4 in fig.6 .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath4 is much stronger for the mn - doped samples compared with the zn - doped ones , which indicates different impurity scattering effects in the two sets of samples . for mn - doped samples",
    ", the enhanced average magnetic moments could act as pair breakers and be responsible for the quick suppression of superconducting transition temperature , on the other hand the negative uniaxial chemical pressure effect along the a - axis ( according to the change of lattice constants ) may also have contributions on that . while for zn - doped samples the residue resistivity does not increases so much , therefore perhaps the impurity scattering by the zn impurities are mainly small angle scattering ( or small momentum transfer ) , therefore it can not break the interpocket scattering pairing .",
    "this is understandable since the zn@xmath19 and fe@xmath19 have very similar ionic sizes .",
    "one may argue that the weak suppression to t@xmath10 in the zn - doped samples is due to the weak impurity scattering effect ( which is actually also very intriguing ) , however , even taking this small change of @xmath4 in the zn - doped samples and assuming the same suppression rate @xmath34 of the mn - doped system , we should have a 3.4 k drop of t@xmath10 at the doping level of 10%-zn / fe .",
    "as marked by the blue dashed line in fig.6 , this is still outer of the range of the data .",
    "this result is consistent with the impurity scattering effect by doping other transition metals such as co and ni,@xcite rh , ir and pd to the fe sites,@xcite where no local strong magnetic moments have been detected and the superconductivity are rather robust together with quite strong impurity scattering , as indicated by the large residual resistivity and small residual resistivity ration ( rrr ) in these materials . the weak impurity scattering as well as",
    "the pair breaking effect given by nonmagnetic disorders in iron pnictide may suggest that these dopants all act as impurity scatters with small momentum transfer . by changing the doping level ,",
    "once these scattering vector in the momentum space is as large as the interpocket vector , we shall see a strong pair breaking effect , although it is non - magnetic .",
    "it is very worthwhile to check this interesting scenario .    before concluding the paper",
    ", we should mention another interesting discovery in our data .",
    "it is found that @xmath35/[\\rho(300k , x)-\\rho(0,x)]$ ] is doping independent in all temperature regions and all data with different doping levels can be nicely scaled ( see fig.7 ) .",
    "this indicates that , in the single band approach , the @xmath36/[m^*(0)/\\tau(0,t)n(0,t)e^2]$ ] is temperature independent .",
    "regarding the similar temperature dependence of all the curves , we would assume that @xmath37 , therefore the temperature independent scaling is due to the electron - boson coupling strength @xmath38 in terms of the effective mass relation @xmath39 .",
    "suppose that adding zn has two effects : ( 1 ) adding impurity scattering and ( 2 ) changing the coupling strength with spin fluctuations ( bosons here ) .",
    "the latter assumption is pretty logical in view of the strong effect of zn on the magnetic properties of the parent compound .",
    "if this is true , zn doping may enhance the superconducting pairing , but unfortunately it is offset by its pair - breaking effect as an impurity .",
    "it is very worthwhile to check whether this scaling holds also in other systems .    /[\\rho(300k , x)-\\rho(0,x)]$ ] for zn - doped samples with different doping levels , where @xmath40 represents the resistivity of the sample at temperature `` @xmath41 '' and with doping level `` @xmath42''.,width=302 ]",
    "we fabricated and measured the resistivity , hall effect , magnetoresistance and dc magnetization in mn and zn doped ba@xmath0k@xmath0fe@xmath1as@xmath1 samples .",
    "the mn - doping enhances the residual resistivity and suppresses the superconducting transition temperature drastically .",
    "further analysis indicates that the mn - doping induces strong local magnetic moments ( @xmath5 2.58 @xmath6 ) which play as pair breakers .",
    "the impurity scattering measured by the residual resistivity @xmath4 in the zn - doped samples is very weak , accompanied by a negligible suppression to t@xmath10 .",
    "a possible explanation is that the impurity scattering by the zn impurities are mainly small angle scattering ( or small momentum transfer ) , therefore it can not break the pairing given by the interpocket scattering .",
    "finally we found a scaling of the normal state resistivity : @xmath35/[\\rho(300k , x)-\\rho(0,x)]$ ] .",
    "this is explained as the enhancement of the coupling strength between electrons and the spin fluctuations induced by the zn doping .",

    "<S> resistivity , hall effect , magnetoresistance and dc magnetization were measured in mn and zn doped ba@xmath0k@xmath0fe@xmath1as@xmath1 samples . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the mn - doping can depress the superconducting transition temperature drastically with a rate of @xmath2/mn-@xmath3 = -4.2 k , while that by zn - doping is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> detailed analysis reveals that the mn - doping enhances the residual resistivity ( @xmath4 ) significantly , and induces strong local magnetic moments ( @xmath5 2.58 @xmath6 ) which play as pair breakers . while the impurity scattering measured by @xmath4 in the zn - doped samples is much weaker , accompanied by a negligible pair breaking effect . </S>",
    "<S> a possible explanation is that the impurity scattering by the zn impurities are mainly small angle scattering ( or small momentum transfer ) , therefore it can not break the pairing induced by the interpocket scattering and thus affect the superconducting transition temperature weakly . </S>"
