    "ref.@xcite for a related detailed investigation .    however , when the parameters are such that a true bulk part of the pattern is established in which amplitude _ and _ wave number are constant then the selected frequency and lateral pattern profile seem to be independent of the system size .",
    "this always occurs in sufficiently large systems when the through - flow is sufficiently strong .",
    "we have investigated convection roll structures in systems of finite length that propagate downstream in an externally applied lateral flow with roll axes perpendicular to the flow direction subject to six different inlet / outlet bcs . within the absolutely unstable parameter regime",
    "a unique pattern selection is observed .",
    "the selected convection patterns are independent of parameter history , initial condition , and system length provided the latter is large enough to allow for a saturated bulk region with homogeneous pattern amplitude and wave number .",
    "but they depend on the lateral bc . the outlet bc influences the convection structures only locally in the vicinity of the outlet while the globally constant frequency and the lateral profiles of pattern amplitude and wave number and their bulk values are basically determined by the inlet bc .",
    "the selected frequency @xmath51 of the pattern oscillation is an eigenvalue of a nonlinear eigenvalue problem with the set of time periodic convection fields , @xmath171 , being the associated eigenfunction .",
    "the analysis of the appropriate gle approximation suggests that the eigenfunction associated to the selected eigenfrequency varies as smoothly and as little as possible under the imposed bc .",
    "this property is similar to the ground state behavior of the linear stationary quantum mechanical schrdinger equation .    different lateral bcs entail different frequencies and eigenfunctions , i.e. , lateral pattern profiles .",
    "for example , inlet conditions that exert a phase pinning force on one or more of the fields of traveling convection rolls reduce the frequency .",
    "the spatial growth behavior and the pattern profile of the convective structures in the region between inlet and bulk saturated pattern is strongly influenced by the inlet bc and can be quite intricate . while the frequencies and bulk wave numbers obtained for various bcs and through - flow rates well inside the absolutely unstable regime differ substantially they all fall onto a linear dispersion curve . finally , when approaching with increasing @xmath55 the border between absolute and convective instability the eigenfrequencies and also the spatial pattern profiles belonging to different bcs approach each other  with increasing growth length of the pattern from the inlet the influence of the latter on spatiotemporal properties of the convection pattern becomes weaker .",
