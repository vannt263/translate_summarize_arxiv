    "computational modeling of multi - cellular systems has become an increasingly useful tool for the interpretation and understanding of experimental data in a variety of biological areas .",
    "numerous studies have been performed within the modeling community , with application to collective dynamics of unicellular organisms , such as myxobacteria @xcite and slime molds @xcite , and to dynamics within multicellular organisms .",
    "studies of the latter include avascular tumor growth @xcite , tumor angiogenesis @xcite , embryogenesis @xcite , and cell sorting @xcite .",
    "a fundamental issue in modeling cell populations is that of scale .",
    "one is typically interested in systems composed of tens of thousands to many millions of cells , and yet the cell population is often phenotypically heterogeneous .",
    "therein lies the problem of whether or not to include more biological realism at the cellular level , with the inevitable computational cost of being limited to smaller numbers of cells .",
    "the different modeling techniques currently employed can be viewed as different compromises to this inescapable problem . at the most coarse - grained level one",
    "erases cell identity and uses continuous cell densities to describe the system .",
    "the classic model of this type is the keller - segel differential equation model of aggregation in social amoeba @xcite .",
    "similar differential equation models have been applied to many other areas , including , of course , tumor growth @xcite .",
    "cell densities can also be modeled using finite element methods @xcite . at the next finer scale , cells within the population",
    "are modeled as discrete objects , yet with little or no internal structure @xcite .",
    "such models may be constructed either as cellular automata on a grid , or else as many - body simulations with no underlying lattice .",
    "recent work has indicated that in the presence of chemotaxis , grid effects can lead to strong artifacts @xcite .",
    "proceeding to smaller length scales , cells are endowed with a size ( which can change with time during the cell cycle ) , and perhaps anisotropy ( e.g. modeled as ellipsoids ) to mimic cell shape and/or cell polarity @xcite .",
    "an ingenious and popular model of this type is that due to graner and glazier , in which cells are represented as clusters of potts spins on a fine grid @xcite .",
    "the potts model approach has been applied to a wide range of systems , including cell sorting @xcite , slug formation in _ dictyostelium _",
    "@xcite , and avascular tumor growth @xcite . at smaller scales",
    "still , the internal biochemical or biomechanical dynamics of the cell are included , e.g. signal transduction for response to chemical signals , and/or cytoskeleton dynamics via actin polymerization @xcite . as the scale of biological detail becomes more fine , computational constraints limit the size of the cell population . indeed , models primarily concerned with cytoskeleton dynamics typically focus on a single cell .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a framework for modeling multi - cellular systems which is designed to allow simulation of large numbers of cells in three dimensions , but also allows for adaptive cell shape dynamics and the accommodation of successive degrees of intra - cellular biology .",
    "this framework uses `` sub - cellular elements '' ( defined below ) as the fundamental dynamical variables , along with overdamped langevin dynamics @xcite for temporal development of the system .    the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we describe the sub - cellular element model in the next section . in section 3 ,",
    "we use a succession of mean - field approximations to connect our model to more coarse - grained descriptions . in section 4",
    "we briefly discuss efficient implementation of the model and give a simple example of numerical output .",
    "we conclude in section 5 with a summary of the main results of the paper and a discussion of biological extensions of the model .",
    "the cell sets the fundamental scale in multi - cellular systems . as such",
    ", it is natural to base model descriptions of these systems at the cellular scale .",
    "one of the key properties to incorporate in a cell - based model is dynamical change in cell shape ( or more generally , cell polarity ) , which can occur in response to local mechanical interactions with neighboring cells , or in response to long - ranged chemical signaling @xcite .",
    "adaptive changes in cell shape / polarity allow coherent dynamics of large numbers of cells . for example , several mechanisms of large - scale morphological change during gastrulation are due to cell intercalation , which is driven by elongation of individual cells along a particular axis @xcite . from a modeling perspective , cell shape is difficult to parameterize .",
    "for instance , systematically extending an ellipsoid model of cells in three dimensions requires complicated geometrical constructions . ideally , one would like a model in which cell shape emerges from cellular interactions  in other words , for cell shape to be adaptive to the local environment . here , we attempt to instantiate this property by sub - dividing each cell into a number of `` sub - cellular elements . ''",
    "both the intra- and inter - cellular dynamics are written in terms of interactions between these elements .",
    "we shall first describe this dynamics by writing the equations of motion for the elements , and then discuss how this dynamics can be interfaced with the underlying biology .    for simplicity",
    ", consider a system with a constant number @xmath1 of cells in three spatial dimensions , with each cell being composed of @xmath2 elements .",
    "we label an individual cell by @xmath3 and an element in cell @xmath4 by @xmath5 .",
    "for ease of discussion we assume that chemical signaling is absent from the system , so that cells respond purely to local biomechanical interactions . in this case",
    ", the position vector of element @xmath6 is taken to change in time according to three processes : i ) a weak stochastic component , which mimics the underlying fluctuations in the dynamics of the cellular cytoskeleton , ii ) an elastic response to intra - cellular biomechanical forces , and iii ) an elastic response to inter - cellular biomechanical forces .",
    "we assume further that the elements motion is over - damped , so that inertial effects can be ignored .",
    "the equation of motion for the position vector of element @xmath6 takes the form : @xmath7 on the right - hand - side , the noise term @xmath8 is a gaussian distributed random variate with zero mean and correlator @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are vector component labels in the three - dimensional space .",
    "the second and third terms on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ elementeq ] ) represent , respectively , intra- and inter - cellular interactions between the elements .",
    "these interactions are completely characterized by the phenomenological potentials @xmath12 and @xmath13 . at this level of description ,",
    "all relevant biological detail must be encoded into these two potentials .",
    "the elemental composition of cells , along with the inter - elemental potentials , are shown schematically in fig .",
    "1 . we have assumed that `` two - body '' potentials are sufficient to describe the dynamics .",
    "it may be necessary to use `` three - body '' potentials to capture the essence of more complicated interactions .    for given biological applications of this modeling framework , one must intuit ( or better , derive ) reasonable forms for @xmath14 and @xmath13 . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "consider a population of cells which are weakly adhesive to one another .",
    "sub - cellular elements both within and between cells will be mutually repulsive if their separation is below the equilibrium size of an element . for separations larger than this size",
    ", the elements will be mutually attractive , but with the strength of attraction falling off rapidly with separation .",
    "these properties can , for example , be conveniently encoded via a generalized form of the morse potential , which is commonly used in physics and chemistry to model inter - molecular interactions @xcite .",
    "the ( generalized ) morse potential has the explicit form @xmath15 and is illustrated in fig .",
    "it is straightforward to evaluate the position and depth of the attractive potential minimum in terms of the four parameters @xmath16 . in a simple application of the element model",
    ", one can use morse potentials for both @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with parameters chosen to ensure that the former has stronger inter - elemental adhesion than the latter .",
    "this condition is necessary , in this simplest version of the model , to maintain the mechanical integrity of the cells .",
    "the introduction and explicit choice of these potentials has so far been purely phenomenological , and some discussion of the biological motivation for these potentials is necessary . considering a `` typical '' tissue cell , such as a fibroblast or epithelial cell , the mechanical integrity of the cell is maintained by the internal cytoskeleton @xcite .",
    "this is a complex network of different types of interconnected filaments , with actin being the most important filament type for cell motility .",
    "dividing the cell into elements corresponds to modeling the shape and mechanical integrity of the cell in terms of volume elements of cytoskeleton .",
    "the intra - cellular attraction between elements arises from the mechanical rigidity of the cytoskeleton , more specifically , the elastic forces transmitted through filaments connecting neighboring elements .",
    "these interactions are local and thus it is necessary that the potential has a rapid decay with distance .",
    "elements at opposite sides of a cell _ mechanically _ interact through elastic forces mediated by elements comprising the interior of the cell .",
    "the biochemical and biomechanical interactions between cells is complex , and arises from a variety of cell - cell ( and cell - matrix ) contacts , such as gap , tight , and anchoring junctions @xcite .",
    "still , the interactions are local , and , once the cells are linked , one can think of the interaction in terms of a short - ranged elastic potential .",
    "there is no reason to favor the morse potential at this level of description  there are many reasonable potentials that one can write down .",
    "such potentials will , however , be characterized by at least four parameters  two energy scales ( for short - ranged repulsion , and intermediate - range adhesion ) and two length scales , which characterize the size of an element , and its adhesive range .",
    "there are a number of models which have been focused on the detailed mechanics of the cytoskeleton , and its role in cell motility @xcite .",
    "an interesting subject of future study is the derivation of inter - elemental potentials from coarse - graining the underlying cytoskeletal mechanics considered in these more detailed studies .",
    "in this technical section we sketch the derivation of coarser - grained models by applying a succession of mean - field approximations to the element model .",
    "the essence of this section is summarized in fig .",
    "3 , which shows the fundamental objects / fields characterizing the cell models at different scales .    in the first of these coarse - graining steps , we replace the element model by a sub - cellular density model , in which the discrete elements within a given cell @xmath4 are replaced by a smooth average density field @xmath17 .",
    "we stress that a separate density field exists for each cell in the system , although the density fields are strongly correlated to one another . to proceed , we first recast the sub - cellular element model in terms of the probability distribution of individual elements .",
    "we define the probability distribution of element @xmath6 by @xmath18 , where the angled brackets denote an average over the noise @xmath19 . starting from eqs .",
    "( [ elementeq ] ) and ( [ noise ] ) we use standard methods @xcite to derive an equation of motion for @xmath20 , which takes the form @xmath21 \\sum \\limits _",
    "{ \\beta _ { i } \\ne \\alpha _ { i } } p_{\\alpha _ { i},\\beta _ { i}}({\\bf x},t;{\\bf x}',t ) \\\\ & + &   \\nabla \\cdot \\int d^{3}x ' \\ \\left [ \\nabla v_{\\rm inter}(|{\\bf x}-{\\bf x}'| ) \\right ] \\sum _ { j \\ne i } \\sum \\limits _",
    "{ \\beta _ { j } } p_{\\alpha _ { i},\\beta _ { j}}({\\bf x},t;{\\bf x}',t ) \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the `` two - element '' distribution function .",
    "the equation of motion for this two - element distribution will involve the three - element distribution , and so on .",
    "the simplest truncation scheme to break the hierarchy of equations is the mean field approximation ( mfa ) , in which the statistical correlations between elements are discarded . within this mfa",
    "we have @xmath23 .",
    "we now define the sub - cellular density of cell @xmath4 via @xmath24 .",
    "summing over @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ palphai ] ) , and imposing the mfa , we find a closed equation for this sub - cellular density function , which takes the form of an advection - diffusion equation : @xmath25 where the velocity potential experienced by the density field of cell @xmath4 is given by @xmath26 the mfa used to derive this density equation will typically be good when the number of elements used to define the cell is very large",
    ". the density representation may well be interesting to explore from an analytical standpoint . however , it is probably not so useful for numerical implementation . for simulation of @xmath1 cells ,",
    "one must simultaneously integrate @xmath1 coupled partial differential equations on a fine three dimensional grid .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , the underlying element model , expressed in eq .",
    "( [ elementeq ] ) , can be very efficiently encoded for simulation with no need of an underlying grid .",
    "we take this opportunity to mention that eq .",
    "( [ subcellade ] ) can be discretized in such a way that it resembles a master equation @xcite . in this representation",
    ", the density of cell @xmath4 can be interpreted as a probability distribution of identical elements , which move from one grid site to the next by activated hopping .",
    "the hopping rate has the arrhenius form @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 is the change in velocity potential , for an element from cell @xmath4 , between the two grid sites of interest , which is actually non - trivial to compute since it depends self - consistently on the density @xmath29 ) . the multi - cellular system as a whole is then defined on a grid , with each grid site able to accommodate ( one or more ) elements from the @xmath1 different cells .",
    "the elements move about the lattice ( and consequently interact ) via activated hopping , with highly non - linear hopping rates as indicated above .",
    "this representation , although not easily implemented , illustrates a qualitative connection between a discretized form of the sub - cellular element model ( after one level of mfa ) and the lattice - based potts model @xcite .",
    "this discretized form of the element model has the flavor of a lattice - gas analog to the potts model  in the sense that a lattice - based element moves over the lattice and yet keeps its original parent cell identity , whereas a potts spin is defined at a lattice site and identifies , at a given time , the cell spanning that particular site .",
    "having to hand these two distinct models of multi - cellular systems ( the sub - cellular element model , as expressed in eq.([elementeq ] ) , and the potts model ) defined at similar scales of biological realism , will allow useful cross - validation of these approaches , especially when applied to complicated biological systems .",
    "we can use the density equation ( [ subcellade ] ) to coarse - grain to another scale  where now only gross properties ( which we refer to loosely as `` moments '' ) of the sub - cellular density field are used to characterize the cell .",
    "this coarse - graining step is analogous to a multipole expansion in electromagnetism .",
    "the zeroth moment of cell @xmath4 is its mass , which is defined by @xmath30 . within the present discussion ,",
    "this quantity is independent of time and cell index @xmath4 since we have assumed that all cells have the same number of elements , and that the number of elements does not change with time .",
    "proceeding to the first moment , we define the position vector of the center of mass of cell @xmath4 via @xmath31 .",
    "the equation of motion for this position vector is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ subcellade ] ) and takes the form @xmath32 we briefly mention the second moment of cell @xmath4 , namely its inertia tensor @xcite .",
    "this is defined via @xmath33 .",
    "an equation of motion , similar to eq .",
    "( [ com ] ) , can be written down for this tensor .",
    "this quantity contains crucial information regarding the _ mechanical polarity _ of the cell .",
    "higher order moments can be defined and contain successively more information about the shape and density distribution of the cell .",
    "since the equations of motion of these moments are written in terms of integrals over the sub - cellular density , they are all strongly inter - dependent . to write closed equations again requires some form of truncation . here",
    "we use the simplest , which is again a form of mfa , namely : @xmath34 .",
    "this allows us to express the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ com ] ) in terms of @xmath35 , and we find the closed equation @xmath36 there are two interesting points to note : i ) the intra - cellular potential has vanished under this approximation , since we are essentially shrinking the cells to points , and ii ) the dynamics are now deterministic . concerning the first point ,",
    "the intra - cellular potential will reappear in this coarse - grained description if we include second - order effects  namely , if we derive two coupled equations for each cell , describing the time - dependence of the cell s position vector and its inertia tensor .",
    "concerning the second point , the effect of the noise @xmath37 has vanished since the first mfa leading to eq .",
    "( [ subcellade ] ) essentially assumes an infinite number of elements , so that the explicit noise terms are averaged to zero .",
    "the noise from a finite number ( @xmath2 ) of elements will be non - zero , and have a variance which scales as @xmath38 .",
    "this weak noise ( which describes the random wandering of the center of mass ) can be added to eq .",
    "( [ discrete ] ) _ a posteriori _ in order to retain stochasticity in this discrete cell representation . one can then write eq .",
    "( [ discrete ] ) as @xmath39 where the noise @xmath40 has zero mean , and correlator @xmath41 , where @xmath42 .",
    "this stochastic model , which tracks the positions of the cells , is precisely that studied by newman and grima @xcite . as shown in that work , a further mfa applied to eq .",
    "( [ discrete_noise ] ) leads to a closed equation for the density of cells , which is defined via @xmath43 .",
    "we omit the details here and simply give the final result : @xmath44 where the coarse - grained velocity potential @xmath45 for the cell density has the form @xmath46 a rigorous derivation of this last step has been given by stevens in the context of chemotaxis @xcite , and uses the limit of infinite cell number , with an appropriately scaled chemotactic coupling .    finally , after three levels of coarse - graining , we have arrived at a partial differential equation for the cell density , as given in eqs .",
    "( [ deneq ] ) and ( [ velpot ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , this level of description has been widely used to describe the large - scale dynamics of cell populations .",
    "however , as should be clear from this analysis , a great deal of statistical information and smaller - scale biomechanics must be discarded at this scale",
    ". it would be very interesting to rederive the density equations from a more careful analysis .",
    "some details of the intra - cellular potentials ( especially regarding cell polarity ) can be captured in this largest - scale description through i ) calculating renormalized parameters , such as the diffusion coefficient @xmath47 , in the density description ( [ deneq ] ) , and ii ) deriving the companion equation for a `` cell polarity field '' from the discrete cell equations for the inertia tensor .",
    "we now return to the sub - cellular element model as described in section 2 .",
    "the numerical implementation of this model turns out to be fairly straightforward and efficient .",
    "since the fundamental dynamical variables are position vectors , we have no need for an underlying grid , and simply need to track the values of the @xmath48 vectors @xmath49 which completely describe the state of the system at any given time .",
    "it is worth mentioning that some care must be taken in constructing the algorithm so as to avoid a cpu cost which scales as @xmath50 .",
    "this would arise from attempting to interact every element with every other in order to update the system .",
    "clearly this is not necessary since the potentials are short - ranged . as such , the algorithm only needs to interact a given element @xmath6 with those elements which are close enough to have a non - negligible interaction .",
    "so long as we can efficiently identify these nearby elements , our algorithm will have a cpu cost which scales as @xmath51 .",
    "this will allow the simulation of large numbers of cells with moderate to large numbers of elements per cell .",
    "there are a number of ways to identify nearby elements .",
    "the methods to achieve this have been developed over the years in molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "examples are neighbor tables and the more sophisticated binary search trees and octrees .",
    "we have employed a method based on `` sectors . ''",
    "the three dimensional system is broken up into a grid of sectors , the size of a sector chosen to be about twice the range of inter - elemental interactions .",
    "the dynamics of the elements are completely oblivious to the sectors .",
    "the sectors simply allow one to construct a look - up table wherein for each sector there is a list of the identity of those elements in that sector .",
    "when one calculates the interactions of a given element , one computes the interactions between that element and all those in its own sector and the nearest - neighbor sectors .",
    "temporal development is performed using an explicit euler discretization , with time increment @xmath52 .    in fig .",
    "4 we show an example of the output of this algorithm .",
    "in this example we have simulated 128 cells , with each cell constructed from 20 sub - cellular elements .",
    "both the intra- and inter - cellular potentials are chosen to be generalized morse potentials , with parameter sets @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "other parameter values are @xmath55 and @xmath56 . for ease of presentation we have simulated the cells in a quasi - two - dimensional geometry , with hard - wall boundary conditions at @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which could represent an epithelial layer bounded by a basement membrane .",
    "the system is shown after about 3000 iterations , starting from a random distribution of cell positions ( with the initial positions of the elements for each cell randomly distributed in a small region about these cell positions ) .",
    "this simulation requires about 3 minutes on a 2ghz pc . extrapolating to larger systems",
    ", we see that thousands of iterations for a system of @xmath59 cells ( each with 20 elements ) requires a few hours of cpu time on a pc .",
    "more sophisticated optimization of the algorithm will allow further improvements in efficiency .",
    "note that as a result of the elements attempting to form inter - cellular adhesive bonds with elements of nearby cells , the cells have adapted their cell shapes to their local biomechanical environment .",
    "a more systematic numerical study comparing the different coarse - grained descriptions is currently in progress @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a model of interacting multi - cellular systems , in which the fundamental objects are not cells , but `` sub - cellular elements ''  by which we mean , in the simplest sense , small volume elements of intra - cellular cytoskeleton .",
    "the dynamics of the elements is described by langevin equations , as given in eq .",
    "( [ elementeq ] ) .",
    "the three dynamical contributions to a given element s motion are i ) a weak stochastic component , ii ) local biomechanical interactions with other elements within the same cell , described by a phenomenological potential @xmath12 , and iii ) local biomechanical interactions with elements in nearby cells , these described by a potential @xmath60 ( see fig .",
    "the success of the model in a given biological application depends , in large part , on well - chosen forms of these potentials .",
    "the generic form of these potentials is reasonably well captured by the generalized morse potential ( fig .",
    "we have outlined , in section 3 , a series of coarse - graining procedures ( summarized in fig .",
    "3 ) , whereby the sub - cellular element model can be linked to models at larger scales , such as discrete cell models and differential equation models describing the macroscopic cell density . in section 4",
    "we indicated how an efficient algorithm may be constructed to integrate eq .",
    "( [ elementeq ] ) forward in time for large numbers of cells / elements , and gave an example from a simulation of a sheet of cells ( fig .",
    "4 ) .        for simplicity , in this introductory paper",
    "we have presented the element model for a population of @xmath1 identical cells .",
    "phenotypic heterogeneity at the cell level can be described by attaching cell labels to the noise strength ( @xmath61 ) , intra - cellular potentials ( @xmath62 ) , and inter - cellular potentials ( @xmath63 ) .      for many applications it will not be sufficient to construct a cell from @xmath2 identical elements . for instance",
    ", it might be necessary to distinguish elements in the interior of the cell ( `` cytoplasmic elements '' ) from elements on the surface of the cell ( `` membrane elements '' ) .",
    "different element types can easily be instantiated by defining the appropriate classes of intra- and inter - cellular potentials . in the example",
    "just given , the inter - cellular interactions would primarily be described by an inter - cellular potential connecting membrane elements from neighboring cells , while the cytoplasmic elements would interact only with elements within the same cell .",
    "in addition , elements can be endowed with internal variables registering environmental variables such as ph or nutrient level , and communicate these variables to neighboring elements to trigger appropriate cell response .",
    "cells not only adhere to each other , but also interact biomechanically with a range of non - cellular environmental structures , such as the extra - cellular matrix or various gel - like media @xcite . in some cases these structures",
    "are produced by the cells themselves . within the spirit of the element model",
    ", these extra - cellular structures can also be constructed from elements ( i.e. elastically coupled degrees of freedom on the same length scale as the sub - cellular elements ) with appropriately defined interaction potentials to describe the cell / non - cell interactions .      we have been exclusively concerned with short - ranged biomechanical interactions in this paper . equally important for many applications ( e.g. embryogenesis , wound healing ) are long - ranged chemical interactions .",
    "the simplest way to introduce such interactions in the element model is to chemically couple the centers of mass of cells which are signaling to one another .",
    "then , since the source and sink of the signal are points , it is straightforward to implement the green function methods developed in some detail in newman and grima @xcite .",
    "these methods encode the diffusion of chemical signals through the diffusion equation green function ( which allows one to avoid introducing a fine grid for explicit integration of the chemical diffusion equations ) .",
    "more sophisticated treatments would be based on cell polarity induced by the chemical signal .",
    "for instance , one could use chemically responsive element types within the cell , so that the cell as a whole responds to a chemical signal via a sub - cellular element response , followed by a cell - level response mediated by elastic interactions of the responsive element to the non - responsive ones .      for many applications , and in particular that of tumor growth ,",
    "cells in the population are undergoing numerous cell divisions over the time scales of interest .",
    "cell growth can be accommodated in the modeling framework by allowing new elements to be spawned within the cell ( based on , for instance , an internal monitoring of nutrient levels as discussed above in subsection 5.2 ) .",
    "mitosis is more complicated .",
    "it can be `` forced '' upon a cell using some form of threshold conditions , under which the elements segregate into two daughter cells .",
    "however , more elegant mechanisms can no doubt be devised .    in this final section",
    "we have tried to give a flavor of possible biological extensions of the model , and the ease with which they can be implemented within the element framework .",
    "this flexibility must ideally be tempered by minimal incremental model - building in order to keep models simple enough to understand from both quantitative and biological perspectives . with this caveat in mind",
