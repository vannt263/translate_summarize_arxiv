    "in fact , a number of surveys have demonstrated that most star - forming galaxies between @xmath0 are clumpy , disturbed , or disk - like , and only @xmath8 have surface brightness profiles consistent with galactic spheroids ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "there are two limitations to the analyses cited above .",
    "the first is associated with the wavelength of observation . to date , most morphological surveys of @xmath5 galaxies have been conducted in the rest - frame ultraviolet , where light from newly - born stars dominates .",
    "this limitation can have a profound effect on the results , as in the nearby universe , galaxies become less concentrated , more clumpy , and more asymmetric as one shifts the observing window from the red and infrared to the ultraviolet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a second limitation of most morphological analyses arises from the galaxy sample selection .",
    "most studies of @xmath5 systems have focused on objects that were identified , at least in part , on the basis of their continuum brightness .",
    "this criterion creates a bias in favor of high stellar - mass objects located on the bright end of galaxy luminosity function .",
    "lower - mass objects , which represent the bulk of the epoch s galaxies , have not been well - represented .    in this investigation , we address these two problems using images from the _ hubble space telescope s ( hst ) _ wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) and the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) that were taken as part of the cosmic assembly near - ir deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels ) , the great observatories origin deep survey ( goods ) , and the wfc3 early release science ( ers ) program @xcite .",

    "the structural properties of our @xmath5 galaxies were measured using a reduction pipeline very similar to that developed by @xcite for the analysis of rest - frame uv images .",
    "we began with the wfc3 f160w frames and extracted an @xmath44 postage - stamp region around each galaxy .",
    "we then identified all possible sources within each galaxy cutout by using the sextractor catalog builder @xcite with extraction parameters detect_minarea@xmath45 , deblend_mincont @xmath46 , and a uniform background .",
    "a second sextractor pass , this time with detect_minarea@xmath47 , was employed to compute the flux - weighted centroid of each object .",
    "we note that in this particular analysis of @xmath5 galaxy morphology , the identification of f160w counterparts to our emission - line selected galaxies was not an issue . for the oelgs , which were originally selected using the g141 infrared grism on the wfc3 ,",
    "the identification of the f160w source was part of the discovery and spectral extraction process @xcite .",
    "for the laes , the formal @xmath48 astrometric uncertainty of the musyc frames was confirmed by @xcite during their analysis of laes on _ hst _ rest - frame uv images . with this precision ( @xmath49 pixels on the archival f160w frames ) , there is little ambiguity as to the most likely counterpart .",
    "finally , most of the galaxies studied in this program have data in at least six filters : f435w , f606w , f775w , f814w , f850lp , an f160w .",
    "this wide wavelength coverage , coupled with the requirement that the galaxy be well - detected ( s / n @xmath50 ) on the f160w image , ensured that any source present in the discovery image was also detectable on multiple candels frames .",
    "once the likely f160w counterparts were identified , we measured their sizes through a series of circular apertures centered on the galaxies centroids in the f160w image .",
    "( because of the relatively high signal - to - noise ratio of the detections , the choice of filter used for this centroiding has little effect on the analysis . )",
    "we then estimated each galaxy s petrosian - like radius by calculating the radial distance at which the galaxy s local surface brightness , @xmath51 , falls to half the mean surface brightness contained with its aperture @xcite .",
    "in other words , @xmath52 as this quantity is defined in terms of a surface brightness ratio , it is relatively insensitive to the depth of the image and thus a robust measure of size . moreover , in almost all cases , the @xmath53 radius is very close to what would be derived for the galaxy s half - light radius , if the surface brightness profile were to be extrapolated to infinity @xcite .    along with size , we also computed each galaxy s compactness as viewed in the rest - frame optical .",
    "following @xcite we defined a system s concentration index using the ratio of radii enclosing 80% and 20% of the galaxy s light , i.e. , @xmath54\\ ] ] through this definition , elliptical galaxies in the local universe would have values of @xmath55 , bulgeless spiral galaxies would have @xmath56 , and a gaussian profile would have @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "since cosmological surface - brightness dimming makes it difficult to measure the total luminosity of faint , distant galaxies , we again adapted a dimensionless ratio of surface brightnesses in our measurements of concentration .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that for intermediate redshift objects , the total magnitude of a galaxy is well approximated by the light contained within a radius that is 1.5 times that defined by @xmath58 , and it is this value we use to compute @xmath59 .",
    "finally , we repeated the above analyses in the rest - frame ultraviolet , using the deep f435w , f606w , f775w , f814w and f850lp images of the fields .",
    "these data , which are drizzled to @xmath60  per pixel , have roughly twice the resolution as the f160w frames , but reach a similar depth .",
    "these additional images allowed us to trace the behavior of concentration and size versus the wavelength of observation .    to estimate the uncertainties on our galaxy sizes",
    ", we used the results of @xcite , who conducted a series of monte carlo simulations on the f814w images of the goods @xcite , gems @xcite , and hudf surveys .",
    "their analysis showed that the fractional uncertainty in the measured half - light radius is related to the total flux , @xmath61 , contained within an object by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the pixel - to - pixel flux uncertainty derived from the weight map , i.e. , @xmath64 .",
    "we adopt this relation for measurements in all our filters .",
    "our size and concentration results for oelgs and laes in the f814w and f160w filters are presented in tables [ tbl : oelg ] and [ tbl : lae ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : sizes ] displays histograms of the half - light radii listed in these tables . before interpreting these data , however , it is important to understand their limitations .",
    "the majority of the galaxies detected in our survey have small angular sizes and may be unresolved , even at _ hst _ resolution . to investigate this possibility , we determined the instrumental resolution of our images using ` tiny tim ` , the _ hst s _ point - spread - function ( psf ) modeling program @xcite . using this software",
    ", we created a series of point source images through the acs / f814w and wfc3/f160w filters and measured their half - light radii in exactly the same manner as for our galaxies .",
    "these simulations reveal that objects with @xmath65 less than 2.8 pixels ( @xmath66 ) in the acs s f814w filter and 2.4 pixels ( @xmath67 ) in wfc3 s f160w filter have sizes consistent with that of the median value of our modeled point sources . any galaxy with a value of @xmath65 smaller than these limits",
    "should therefore be treated as unresolved . in figure",
    "[ fig : sizes ] , the resolution limits are shown as a dotted line ( for the f814w frames ) and a dashed line ( for the f160w data ) .    as is apparent from figure  [ fig : sizes ] ,",
    "virtually all of the @xmath7 star - forming galaxies present in our sample are ( at least marginally ) resolved at rest - frame ultraviolet wavelengths . however , when viewed at longer wavelengths with the @xmath68  per pixel plate scale of the wfc3 s infrared camera , more than half ( @xmath69 ) of our targets have profiles consistent with that of a point source . for the laes , only 12 of the",
    "35 ( @xmath70 ) are resolved at wfc3 resolution , while for the oelgs the fraction is 21 out of 61 ( again , @xmath70 ) .",
    "although this limitation prevents us from probing the full range of rest - frame optical morphologies exhibited by our @xmath5 emission - line sources , we can still use the data to draw conclusions about the epoch s star - forming population .",
    "the first conclusion arises from the similarity between the size distribution of laes and that found for galaxies identified via their rest - frame optical emission lines .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test can find no statistically significant difference in the distributions , either in the uv or in the optical .",
    "the same is true for the galaxies concentration index , which typically falls between 2 and 3 : the distribution of @xmath59 values for laes is statistically indistinguishable from that of oelgs .",
    "although the number of ly@xmath2 emitters in our study is relatively small , the result does confirm the analysis of @xcite , who showed that galaxies selected on the basis of their ly@xmath2 emission have very similar properties to those of systems found via their rest - frame optical emission lines .",
    "our concentration indices of laes in the rest - frame uv also match those of @xcite , who measured the same quantity in @xmath33 laes .",
    "a second result comes from the wide - range of sizes exhibited by our emission - line selected galaxies .",
    "although the bulk of the galaxy population is extremely compact , with half - light radii less than @xmath6  kpc , there is a tail to the distribution that extends to almost 6  kpc .",
    "interestingly , this spread is not entirely driven by stellar mass .",
    "as figure  [ fig : radius_mass ] illustrates , there is a correlation between radius and stellar mass , but the scatter about the relation is substantial . at the high - mass end ( @xmath71 ) , our rest - frame uv results are consistent with the analysis of @xcite , who have traced the @xmath72 evolution of the size - mass distribution using continuum - selected candels galaxies with photometric results .",
    "our results also agree with the measured the sizes and masses of @xmath73 ly@xmath2 and h@xmath2 selected galaxies with @xmath74 @xcite . unfortunately , while we would like to derive a similar relation for the galaxies in the rest - frame optical , the limited resolution of the _",
    "wfc3 ir camera currently precludes this possibility .",
    "the fact that many of our @xmath5 emission - line galaxies can not be resolved in the f160w frames leads to the most important result of this study : most of the galaxies analyzed in this program have smaller half - light radii in the rest - frame optical than they do in the rest - frame ultraviolet .",
    "this result is displayed vividly in figure  [ fig : rvr ] , where we plotted the rest - frame uv half - light radius of each galaxy , as derived from their median size on the f435w , f606w , f775w , f814w , and f850lp frames , against their their half - light radius in f160w .",
    "the offset in the sizes is obvious .",
    "the relation is not perfect , and some galaxies are larger in the rest - frame optical than they are in the uv .",
    "nevertheless , the result is striking , and demonstrates that the star - forming regions detected by the rest - frame uv images of _ hst _ are not simply knots imbedded in larger , somewhat older systems .",
    "the difference between the rest - frame optical and rest - frame uv sizes can be quantified using the kaplan - meier estimator for the empirical cumulative distribution function @xcite . this estimator accounts for the existence of censored data ( i.e. , points with only upper limits ) , and calculates @xmath75 confidence intervals on the solution using a method developed by @xcite .",
    "( see chapter 10 of @xcite for more on information on the analysis of censored data . )",
    "the results of the kaplan - meier test are shown in figure  [ fig : kaplan_ecdf ] . from the figure",
    ", it is apparent that @xmath76 of our oelgs and laes are smaller in the rest - frame optical than they are in the uv , and that the median fractional change in @xmath65 is 40% .",
    "this wavelength shift in the appearance of our @xmath5 emission - line galaxies is also reflected in the systems mean concentration index .",
    "the majority of the galaxies in our dataset are unresolved on the f160w frames , and hence their concentrations are undefined . however ,",
    "if we only consider those objects which are resolved , there is a systematic change in their structure with wavelength .",
    "specifically , as figure  [ fig : cvc ] illustrates , both the oelgs and laes appear more concentrated in the rest - frame optical than in the uv by a median value of @xmath77 .",
    "moreover , this offset is not due to issues associated with small , semi - resolved objects , as the effect is larger in the more extended galaxies .",
    "thus , the behavior we observe in the local universe , with galaxies appearing less concentrated in the ultraviolet , is mimicked at high-@xmath78 .    could those objects which appear larger in the rest - frame optical than in the uv be associated with mergers ? to investigate this possibility , we used the candels catalog to compute the surface density of objects present on the images , and then increased this number by @xmath79 to account of possible sources that are present in our sextractor catalog but below the candels limit .",
    "based on this density , objects projected within @xmath80 of any program galaxy have less than a @xmath81 chance of being a chance superposition .",
    "those objects with companions satisfying this criterion are shown in figure  [ fig : rvr ] as open symbols .",
    "as one can see from the figure , close - by companions are principally associated with large systems : although @xmath82 of the @xmath5 star - forming galaxies studied in this program have neighbors superposed within @xmath80 , six out of our eight largest systems ( @xmath83  kpc ) belong to this subset .",
    "less clear is the evidence for associating the @xmath84 galaxies with mergers : just 1/3 of those systems have nearby companions .",
    "thus , it is possible that galaxy interactions may have an affect on the rest - frame optical sizes of star - forming galaxies , but the signal is weak at best .      figures  [ fig : sizes ] , [ fig : rvr ] , and [ fig : kaplan_ecdf ] all demonstrate that our @xmath5 star forming galaxies appear smaller at observer s frame infrared wavelengths than in the observer s frame optical .",
    "this behavior is opposite to the effect produced by diffraction , and the opposite of that expected from localized starbursts within the galaxies , where the uv may be emitted in just a few star forming regions .",
    "but it is still possible that the offset is due to an instrumental systematic or a product of our reduction procedures . to test for such effects",
    ", we undertook a series of experiments to explore the effects of image depths , binning , and wavelength on the results .    to test for a systematic error due to image depth , we added variable amounts of gaussian noise to our images , and re - measured the half - light radii of the galaxies as a function of this noise .",
    "this analysis indicates that even when the signal - to - noise ratio is decreased by a factor of 30 , there is no bias in our size measurements .",
    "( the precision of our estimated radii decreases , of course , as there is much greater scatter in the computed half - light radii .",
    "however , the values of @xmath65 remain unbiased . )",
    "this result suggests that our conclusions are not being biased due to variations in the depths of the images .",
    "the @xmath68  per pixel image scale of the wfc3 s ir camera is twice as large as that for the acs , which was used for all the other bandpasses in this study . to test whether this observational constraint has any affect on our results , we ran a @xmath85 boxcar smoothing algorithm over our acs f814w frames ( to mimic the effect of the drizzled images correlated noise ) , binned the resultant image @xmath85 , and remeasured the sizes of our galaxies .",
    "the result is that the half - light estimates on the more coarsely binned frames are @xmath86 _ larger _ than those on the original image .",
    "( this result is true even if we do not smooth prior to binning . )",
    "thus , the effect of the larger pixel size is opposite that needed to explain the offset between observing windows .",
    "finally , we can examine the behavior of @xmath65 with wavelength using solely the ccd data from the acs .",
    "the acs images range over 4000    in the observed frame , and , for objects at @xmath3 , extend from the far uv ( @xmath87   ) to the very near uv ( @xmath42   ) .",
    "this bandpass may be just large enough to check for a wavelength dependence on galaxy size that is independent of the wfc3 instrument .",
    "figure  [ fig : pearson ] illustrates the results of this experiment by plotting the pearson correlation coefficient derived for a size versus wavelength regression against f814w half - light radius . for the oelgs and @xmath3 laes , measurements through the acs s f435w , f606w , f775w , f814w , and f850lp filters all went into deriving the correlation coefficient , while for the @xmath4 laes , the bluest filter was omitted from the analysis ( due to it lying blue ward of lyman-@xmath2 ) . for the smallest objects , i.e. , those with radii only slightly larger than the frame s point spread function ,",
    "there is little evidence for systematic behavior : if anything , the galaxies become larger with wavelength , as might be expected if the psf were dominated by diffraction effects .",
    "however , for the larger galaxies , there is clear evidence for an inverse correlation between the wavelength of observation and size .",
    "again , this result supports our conclusion that emission - line galaxies in the @xmath0 epoch are more extended in the rest - frame uv than they are in the optical .",
    "there are three possible explanations for the shift in observed size for @xmath0 star - forming galaxies .",
    "perhaps the simplest interpretation involves reddening due to dust . in the local universe ,",
    "the measured effective radius of a galaxy decreases significantly with increasing wavelength ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is mostly due to internal extinction : as one moves inward in a galaxy , the surface density of dust increases , leading to an increase in obscuration , especially in the ultraviolet .",
    "the result is a shift in the balance of total flux towards larger radii , which artificially increases the half - light radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the same effect may be in play at the redshifts of our galaxies .    to test for this possibility",
    ", we used the slope of the galaxies uv spectral energy distribution ( @xmath88 ) , which has been measured for all the oelgs in our sample @xcite . in general , the stellar extinction in these galaxies is rather low :",
    "if we adopt @xmath89 as the expected uv slope from an unreddened starburst population @xcite , then the median value of @xmath90 translates into a stellar differential extinction of only @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is no significant correlation between @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "this strongly suggests that reddening is not responsible for the smaller values of optical @xmath65 .",
    "alternatively , one might argue that our measurements are affected by the presence of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "this explanation is extremely unlikely .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have tested for agn activity in our samples of ecdf - s laes by excluding objects detected in x - rays and by performing a deep x - ray stacking analysis on the objects .",
    "furthermore , @xcite reported that , while low - luminosity agn could be present in some of our oelgs , their contribution to the rest - frame uv continuum and the rest - frame optical emission lines must be very small .",
    "finally , any agn that would be bright and unobscured enough to affect the distribution of optical light would most likely be even brighter in the uv , thereby shortening the half - light radii .",
    "this effect would work against the trend we observe .",
    "finally , the shift of @xmath65 with wavelength may arise from a gradient in the stellar population .",
    "inside - out models of galaxy formation predict that older stars should condense towards the centers of galaxies , perhaps in a bulge or pseudo - bulge @xcite .",
    "inside - out formation has previously been observed in massive galaxies of the @xmath7 epoch ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and for @xmath94 galaxies at @xmath95 @xcite . here",
    ", we see that the process is also at work in @xmath7 galaxies with much lower stellar masses , @xmath96 .",
    "our results suggest that even the low - mass galaxies of the epoch are beginning to form a bulge or pseudo - bulge , with older stars concentrated in the middle of the galaxy .",
