    "dileptons are crucial probes for studying the properties of the strongly interacting , hot and dense matter which is created in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite .",
    "they are produced during the whole evolution of the created matter , and are not subject to strong interactions with the medium .",
    "dielectron pairs are sensitive probes of the medium properties throughout the spacetime evolution of the medium  @xcite because they are produced through a variety of mechanisms and in several different kinematic regimes .    in the low invariant mass region , @xmath7 gev/@xmath4 ( lmr ) ,",
    "the dilepton production is dominated by in - medium decay of vector mesons ( @xmath2 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) in the hadronic gas phase . in - medium",
    "modifications to the mass and width of the vector mesons are considered a link to chiral symmetry restoration  @xcite . in the vacuum , chiral symmetry",
    "is spontaneously broken , which results in mass differences between chiral partners [ e.g. @xmath2 and @xmath10 . in the hot , dense medium , chiral symmetry",
    "is expected to restore and the mass distributions of @xmath2 and @xmath11 are expected to change and degenerate . since it is extremely challenging to measure a spectral function for the @xmath11 meson , one can not directly observe the disappearance of the mass splitting between the @xmath2 and @xmath11 experimentally .",
    "instead , efforts are devoted to studying the modification of vector meson spectral function .",
    "two schematic scenarios are used to describe the in - medium @xmath2 spectrum function : a broadened and a dropping - mass @xmath2 .",
    "the broadened @xmath2 scenario incorporates finite temperature effects into self - energy corrections through medium interactions and @xmath12 annihilations  @xcite .",
    "the dropping mass scenario uses the quark mean field from a high temperature / density regime wherein constituent quarks are the relevant degrees of freedom , and then extrapolates down to a low temperature / density regime wherein hadrons are appropriate degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the ceres experiment at the cern - sps reported an excess dielectron yield with respect to the known hadronic sources in the lmr in pb+au collisions at @xmath1 = 17.2 gev , which indicates that the vector mesons are modified in medium  @xcite .",
    "more recently , na60 published a precise measurement of the dimuon invariant mass spectra in in+in collisions at @xmath1 = 17.3 gev  @xcite .",
    "the results show a significant excess in the lmr above the hadronic sources . in both cases ,",
    "the excess is consistent with a broadened @xmath2 spectral function  @xcite , but not with a @xmath2 dropping - mass scenario  @xcite , where both models have been evaluated for the same fireball evolution . in the model calculation , the coupling to the baryons in the medium plays a dominant role in the broadening of the @xmath2 spectral function  @xcite .    at rhic ,",
    "a significant enhancement in the dielectron continuum , compared with the known hadronic sources , has been observed in the lmr by both the phenix and star collaborations in au+au collisions at @xmath13 gev  @xcite .",
    "results from the star collaboration show that the excess dielectron yield in the mass region 0.3 - 0.76 gev/@xmath6 follows an @xmath14 dependence , where @xmath15 is the number of participant nucleons in a collision  @xcite . however , the phenix collaboration reported significant higher excess dielectron yields in central collisions  @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations  @xcite , which describe the sps dilepton data , fail to consistently describe the low - mass enhancement at low transverse momentum ( @xmath16 ) observed by phenix in both 0 - 10% and 10 - 20% central au+au collisions  @xcite . the same calculations",
    ", however , correctly describe the star measurement of the low-@xmath16 and low - mass enhancement from peripheral to central au+au collisions  @xcite . while the discrepancy between star and phenix in central au+au collisions at @xmath13 gev is still under investigation , it is important to have dilepton measurements at rhic at lower beam energies with the same large acceptance as for the 200 gev data . since the total baryon density does not change significantly from @xmath17 17.3 gev to @xmath17 200 gev  @xcite , it is essential to confirm that the broadened @xmath2 spectral function , which describes the results at 17.3 gev and the 200 gev star data , is consistent with the 19.6 gev results .    in the intermediate mass region , @xmath18 gev/@xmath4 ( imr ) , dilepton production",
    "is expected to be directly related to thermal radiation of the partonic phase , which is considered to be the prime signature of deconfinement  @xcite .",
    "an enhanced yield in this region was first observed by helios/3  @xcite and na38/na50  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the na60 collaboration reported an enhancement in the imr which can not be connected to decays of _ d _ mesons , but may be the result of thermal radiation  @xcite .",
    "however , it is experimentally challenging to extract the signal in the presence of significant background sources from open heavy - flavor semi - leptonic decays , such as @xmath19 or @xmath20 .    in this letter , we report the first dielectron measurements at mid - rapidity in minimum - bias au+au collisions at @xmath1 = 19.6 gev with the star detector  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we present the first acceptance - corrected dielectron excess mass spectra in au+au collisions at @xmath17 19.6 and 200 gev which are compared with measurements from na60 and theoretical model calculations .",
    "the invariant excess dielectron spectra at different centralities and energies allow for a first systematic study of the lifetime of the hot , dense medium using electromagnetic probes at rhic .",
    "it was pointed out that the excess dielectron yield at low mass is proportional to the total lifetime of the hot , dense medium at @xmath1 = 6 - 200 gev  @xcite .",
    "in this analysis , 33 million minimum - bias ( mb ) au+au ( 0 - 80% ) events at @xmath17 19.6 gev , recorded by the star experiment in the year 2011 , were used .",

    "after the velocity cut , electron identification is achieved by cutting on the normalized ionization energy loss ( @xmath33 ) measured by the tpc , where @xmath34 is the energy loss , @xmath35 is the expected @xmath34 for an electron and @xmath36 is the @xmath34 resolution of an electron , which is better than 8%  @xcite .",

    "the like - sign pairs are used to statistically reproduce the combinatorial and correlated pair backgrounds .",

    "the correlated background is the result of two electrons , each of which comes from a different but correlated process of a particle decay or a jet fragmentation .",

    "this correlated background can be reproduced by like - sign pairs .",
    "the unlike - sign and like - sign pairs have different acceptances due to dead areas of the detector and the different bending curvatures of positively and negatively charged particles in the magnetic field .",

    "a mixed - event technique  @xcite is applied to estimate the acceptance differences between the unlike - sign and like - sign distributions .",

    "we subtract the like - sign background ( corrected for the acceptance difference using the mixed event technique mentioned above ) from the unlike - sign distributions to obtain the raw dielectron signals .",
