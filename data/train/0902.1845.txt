    "study of the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) in semiconductor low dimensional structures and its application for spintronics devices have attracted much attention recently @xcite .",
    "there are two important kinds of soi in conventional semiconductors : one is the dresselhaus soi induced by bulk inversion asymmetry @xcite , and the other is the rashba soi caused by structure inversion asymmetry @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the rashba soi is dominant in a narrow gap semiconductor system and the strength of the rashba soi can be tuned by an external gate voltage in hgte @xcite , inas @xcite , in@xmath0ga@xmath1as @xcite , and gaas @xcite quantum wells .",
    "recent research is focused on the electrically - induced generation of a spin - dependent current ( sc ) mediated by soi - type mechanism , e.g. as in the intrinsic spin hall effect in a 3d p - doped semiconductor @xcite and in a 2d electron gas with rashba soi @xcite . here",
    "we study a high quality spin - interacting quantum rings ( qrs ) with a radius on the nanometer scale @xcite .",
    "these systems show aharonov - bohm - type ( ab ) spin - interferences @xcite .",
    "in particular we investigate the dynamics triggered by time - dependent electric fields as provided by time - asymmetric pulses @xcite or tailored laser pulse sequences @xcite .",
    "the quantity under study is the spin - resolved pulse - driven current , in analogy to the spin - independent case @xcite . in a previous work @xcite ,",
    "we investigated the dynamical response of the charge polarization to the pulse application .",
    "no net charge or spin - dependent current is generated because the clock - wise and anti - clock - wise symmetry of the carrier is not broken by one pulse or a series of pulses having the same linear polarization axis .",
    "this symmetry is lifted if two time - delayed pulses with non - collinear polarization axes are applied @xcite . however , to our knowledge all previous studies on light - induced currents in quantum rings did not consider the coupling of the spin to the orbital motion ( and hence to the light field ) , which is addressed in this work .",
    "as detailed below , having done that , it is possible to control dynamically the spin - dependent current in a 1d quantum ring with rashba soi by using two time - delayed linearly polarized electromagnetic pulses . for transparent interpretation of the results only the rashba soi is considered in this work .",
    "the presence of the dresselhaus soi may change qualitatively the results presented here for the spin - dependent non - equilibrium dynamic of the carriers , which can be anticipated from the findings on for the equilibrium case @xcite .",
    "we study the response of charges and spins confined in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) ballistic qr with soi to the application of two short time - delayed linearly polarized asymmetric electromagnetic pulses @xcite .",
    "the effective single particle hamiltonian reads @xmath2 @xcite , with @xmath3 @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the electric and the magnetic fields of the pulse .",

    "the single - particle eigenstates of @xmath7 are represented as @xmath18 where @xmath19 are spinors in the angle dependent local frame , and @xmath20 ( _ t _ means transposed ) where @xmath21 ( if we ignore the zeeman splitting caused by the static magnetic field @xcite ) .",

    "a single pulse does not generate in qr any net charge current because of the degeneracy of the orbital states .",
    "however , the charge will be polarized @xcite and corresponding dipole moments oscillate in the @xmath29 direction with an associated optical emission . applying a second pulse as described above",
    "leads to a non - equilibrium net current , in addition to the persistent charge current caused by the static flux and the soi which causes a su(2 ) vector potential and manifests itself in an induced spin - dependent persistent charge current @xcite .",

    "it has been experimentally observed both in gold rings of radius with 1.2 and 2.0 @xmath57 m @xcite and in a gaas - algaas ring of radius about 1 @xmath57 m @xcite .",

    "we shall present the total charge current ( tcc ) which is a sum of pcc and dcc over all the occupied states .",
    "total spin - dependent current ( tsc ) is obtained in the same way @xcite .",
    "2 shows how the flux and the soi affect the pcc , dcc and tcc . without the soi ,",
    "the jump of the pcc occurs at integer flux for even pair occupation , shown in fig .",
    "the jumps are different in other occupations ( see @xcite ) , here we only focus on the even pair occupation case for clarity .",
    "the periodic sawtooth dependence of the pcc on the flux exhibits has been studied before , e.g. @xcite . at finite soi the jumps in pcc",
    "are shifted to @xmath111 ; the two jumps are the consequences of a superposition of the contributions from the two spin channels .",
    "when the soi strength is such that @xmath112 , ( @xmath113 ) the two jumps become at the half integer which is just the case of @xmath114 occupation in absence of the soi @xcite .",
    "the slope ratio between the two jumps is the same . as can be inferred from the analytic expressions dcc ( cf .",
    "2 ) depends smoothly on the flux .",
    "soi results in a phase shift moving or even exchanging the positions of the minima and maxima , as is for @xmath115 .",
    "the origin of the shape of tcc is deduced from those of pcc and dcc . here",
    "the magnitudes of the two contributions is crucial : the pcc magnitude is related to the numbers of charge carriers , while the dcc magnitude is determined primarily by the product of the @xmath37 and @xmath48 ( that can be externally varied by changing the pulse intensities ) , the delay time @xmath116 , and the ring radius .",
    "3 shows the tcc dependence on the ring radius ( in the absence of the soi ) .",
    "as expected , a larger @xmath117 enhances the dcc . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath117 enters the bessel function argument whose increase suppresses the magnitude of dcc .",
    "it can be shown that the period of the oscillation with @xmath116 increases with increasing the radius .",
    "the magnitudes of the maxima and minima are larger with larger radius .",
    "now we discuss the spin - dependent current projected onto the @xmath27 direction @xcite , i.e. @xmath118 .",
    "the spin - dependent current projected onto the @xmath22 direction ( e.g. the quantization axis of the local spin frame ) is @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "psc posses steps at pcc jumps ( fig .",
    "4(a ) ) as a function of @xmath120 .",
    "this can be understood from the ratio of pcc for different spins ; the soi only introduces a relative effective flux shift ( see eq .",
    "( [ effflux ] ) ) leading to a constant spin - dependent current between the jumps . for dsc vs. @xmath120 ( fig .",
    "4(b ) ) the effective flux leads to a shift of the dsc along the flux axis .",
    "the physics behind this shift is that soi provides a su(2 ) flux , meaning that the pulse - driven ( local frame ) spin - up electrons experience a different flux than those with down spin , leading to a substantial spin - dependent current .",
    "in contrast , a static magnetic flux does not induce a spin - dependent current in the absence of the soi .",
    "this shift and the jumps in the step function of the psc explain the behaviour of tcc in fig .",
    "4(c ) .    the control of tcc and tsc by tuning the pulse - field parameters is demonstrated in fig .",
    "5 . because the two pulses transfer a net angular momentum setting the electrons in motion but they do not couple directly to the spins the tcc and tsc show the same pattern with @xmath116 and @xmath33 . from an experimental point of view",
    "it is essential to note that we are dealing with non - equilibrium quantities which opens the way for their detection via their emission .",
    "e.g. , the tcc and tsc can be detected by measuring the current - induced magnetization of the ring and the generated electrostatic potential @xcite .",
    "in presence of spin - orbit coupling , two time - delayed appropriately shaped electromagnetic pulses generate spin - dependent charge currents . as shown previously for the spin - independent case @xcite , the sign of the current and its magnitude are controllable via the delay time and the strengths of the pulses . from a symmetry viewpoint",
    ", similar phenomena may be expected to occur for other geometries ( wires , squares , etc ) . however , as shown for unbiased superlattices @xcite ( without soi ) details of the generated currents may differ qualitatively .",
    "application of an appropriate train of pulses open the possibility of controlling or even stopping the current @xcite . for increasing the magnitude of the current more intense pulses should be applied .",
    "for generating currents in quantum rings one may also apply circular polarized laser pulses @xcite . in this context",
    "we note the following : from an electrodynamics point of view , generating currents by our pulses is a completely classical effect , i.e. currents are generated in a completely classical system , even though in our case the subsequent excited carrier evolution is quantum mechanical .",
    "for this reason our current is robust to disorder and geometry modifications .",
    "in addition , the tunable time delay between the pulses allows an ultra - fast control the current properties . using circular polarized laser pulses generates currents for quantized systems ( in which case",
    "the rotating - wave approximation can be applied ) . for systems with level broadening on the order of level spacing no appreciable",
    "current is generated .",
    "our disadvantage however is that our pulses are much more demanding to realize experimentally , whereas laser pulses are readily available , in particular at high light intensities allowing thus for a strong current generation .",
    "the dsc is proportional to the dcc which can be comparable to the pcc for small or moderate occupation number case as seen in fig .",
    "the dcc depends on the strength of the field and the delayed time between the two pulses sensitively and dramatically .",
    "we provide now an explicit calculation for the typical values of the cc and sc . for in@xmath0ga@xmath1as /inp",
    "quantum well @xcite we have @xmath121 . for a ring with radius of 100 nm ,",
    "the line velocity is then about @xmath122 , and the current unit is @xmath123 which corresponds to the angular velocity current for one particle .",
    "if we convert it into the unit of an induced magnetization it is a radius - independent quantity @xmath1242 mev / t ( here we use the formula @xmath125 valid for rings considered here @xcite ) .",
