    "periodic distributions of elastic scatterers in an elastic host medium with different physical properties are known as phononic crystals ( pc ) @xcite and they are the elastic analogous of the well - known photonic crystals @xcite . if one of the materials in pc is a fluid , then the system is called sonic crystal ( sc ) @xcite .",
    "all of these systems present interesting physical properties and recently they have received increasing attention mainly due to the great number of applications in several branches of physics and engineering @xcite .",
    "one of the most important properties of these inhomogeneous materials are the so - called band gaps ( bg ) : frequency ranges where waves do not propagate through the periodic system .",
    "the existence of these bg leads to a several applications , for instance , in the case of sc as acoustic filters @xcite , acoustic barriers @xcite or waveguides @xcite , among others .    in periodic systems",
    "bloch s theorem and fourier expansion of the periodic physical properties , transform the acoustic wave equation in an eigenvalue problem .",
    "the eigenfrequencies @xmath1 for each bloch s vector @xmath0 inside the irreducible part of the first brillouin zone constitute the band structure . this methodology is usually called plane wave expansion ( pwe ) @xcite and it can be used to obtain the so - called band structures , i.e. the propagating modes through the periodic system .",
    "the band structures reveal that bg are ranges of frequencies where no real @xmath0 exists .",
    "it has been shown that the eigenvalues of the problem have real value for the case of sc @xcite .",
    "one of the most important properties of the periodic structures is the emergence of the localized modes within the bg when a point defect is introduced @xcite .",
    "a widely technique used in the literature to obtain the effect of the creation of point defects in crystals is the supercell approximation in pwe @xcite .",
    "this approximation gives information only about the propagation nature of the localized modes in the point defects .",
    "in these cases when periodicity is broken or when sc have finite size , evanescent modes inside the periodic system may appear .",
    "localized modes or modes inside the bg are characterized by its evanescent behaviour @xcite . then a more accurate analysis is needed to characterize all the properties of the modes inside the periodic system .",
    "a wave impinging on a complete periodic system with a given frequency @xmath2 inside the bg , is characterized by complex valued wave numbers @xmath3 which represent the multiexponential decay of the evanescent mode inside the periodic system @xcite .",
    "recent works @xcite show an extension of the plane wave expansion ( extended plane wave expansion ( epwe ) ) obtaining the complex part of the bloch s waves revealing that the decay of the modes inside the bg grows as the frequency reaches the center of the bg . in this sense",
    "a localization factor has been defined recently to show this behaviour @xcite .",
    "the localization factor can be also related with recent results that show that , although the decay of these localized modes is multi - exponential , it can be approximated by an exponential like decay considering only the first harmonic of the bloch waves in sc made of rigid cylinders @xcite .    on the other hand , sainidou et al .",
    "@xcite have introduced a novel extension of the multiple scattering theory @xcite for analyzing slabs which consist of slices of different material as long as the periodicity parallel to the surface of the slab is preserved .",
    "the method , called layer multiple scattering ( lms ) allows to study the scattering problem of slabs that are finite in the direction parallel to the surface of the slab , but infinite in the normal directions to this surface .",
    "alternatively , one can use this method to calculate the complex phononic band structures of an infinite crystal , associated with a given crystallographic plane . in this case",
    "the method provides the propagating and evanescent bloch waves of the elastic field in the given crystal , corresponding to a given @xmath0 and a given frequency .",
    "lms has been used to analyze the guidance and quasiguidance of elastic waves in a glass plate coated on one side with a periodic monolayer of polymer spheres , immersed in water , observing the dispersion diagrams of the interacting modes of the composite slab @xcite .",
    "the goal of the paper is to analyze the three main characteristics of defect modes in sc : splitting , symmetry vibrational patterns and evanescent decay of the modes .",
    "in addition to the pwe , to do this study we have used the epwe with supercell approximation because it is fundamental for the complete understanding of the localized modes .",
    "we present the explicit matrix formulation of the supercell approximation in the epwe for @xmath4 point defects . from the complex and real band structures we observe the splitting , and the evanescent behaviour of the localized modes inside the bg around the defect .",
    "we analyze the localized modes inside multi - point defects , specially in the double point defect case .",
    "mst in finite sc is used to analyze the vibrational patterns of the localized modes in a double point defect . in this case , when the distance between both defects is low enough , it appears a symmetric and antisymmetric vibrational modes similar to the case of a system formed by two masses and three springs , or to the zeeman effect in the atomic spectra @xcite .",
    "novel experimental data that are in good agreement with theory show for first time the symmetry of the vibrational patterns of the localized modes in such a double point defect .",
    "moreover we observe the decay of the localized modes outside the double - point defect in good agreement with the results obtained by epwe with supercell approximation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first of all we show the main ingredients of the extended plane wave expansion as well as the explicit matrix formulation of the problem and the extension for a supercell with @xmath4 point defects .",
    "after that , it is shown the numerical , analytical and experimental results of a double - point defect , showing the complete explanation of the splitting , the symmetry of the vibrational patterns and the decay of the localized modes .",
    "finally we show a summary as well as the main conclusions of the work .",
    "the analysis of the propagating modes can be done by the @xmath5 formulation , where the existence of bg is indicated by the absence of bands in determined ranges of frequencies .",
    "the mechanism of creation of bg in finite crystals could be understood by the evanescent behaviour of the modes inside it . at a given frequency @xmath2 inside the bg ,",
    "the evanescent wave is characterized by a complex valued bloch vectors @xmath6 that characterize the decay of the mode inside the periodic structure .",

    ". however , this localized mode presents evanescent behaviour out of the defect because it is surrounded by a perfect periodicity , thus the excited mode in the surrounding crystal by the localized mode presents an imaginary @xmath0 which is related with the evanescent behaviour of the mode outside the point defects @xcite .",
    "the rest of modes inside the bg only present imaginary part , then they are killed inside the crystal because of their evanescent behaviour .      in order to analyze the splitting of the localized modes we have calculated the real and the complex band structures of a sc with a double point defect with the epwe with the supercell approximation using a supercell of size @xmath62 .",

    "when a wave with one of these frequencies impinges on the crystal from outside , the double point defect is sawn and the wave penetrates into the cavity .",
    "then , the borders of the cavity act as a perfect mirrors producing the localization of the wave inside the cavity .",
    "this results in a coupling inside the double - point defect producing two localized modes depending on the distance between the point defects @xcite .",
    "because the splitting depends on the distance and on the shape of the multi - point defect , one can study the vibrational patterns that appear inside the multi - point defect , analyzing the differences in frequency of the localized modes .",
    "the factor @xmath81 indicates how the splitting will be produced . for big values of this factor",
    ", one can expect modes separated in frequencies ( as many as single - point defect constituting the multi - point defect ) , whereas a small factor represents a weak overlap between the point defects in the multi - point defect , which produces narrow splitting .",

    "this real part is related with the wave vector for the localization frequency whereas the imaginary part of the localized mode is related with the rate of decay outside the defect but inside the sc .",
    "as we have seen , the localized modes in the double point defect are distributed around the localized mode of a single point defect",
    ". however , the localized mode of the single defect point appears a little above the midgap frequency ( 926 hz ) .",
    "thus it is expected that the imaginary part of the localized modes of double - point defects present different values for each mode and , as a consequence , each mode presents different evanescent behaviour outside the defect ( see figure [ fig : epwe_figure]b ) .",
    "this prediction of the epwe will be used for distinguishing experimentally the symmetric respect to the antisymmetric modes .",
    "the previous discussion about the splitting of the modes in multi - point defects does not provide information about how the modes are localized or what is the distributed field inside the double cavity .",
    "this will be discussed now .",
    "the results obtained by the pwe or epwe for the localized modes could be used to plot the modal shapes for the defect modes using the eigenvectors . however",
    ", these modal shapes do not take into account the effect of the finite size of the crystal .",
    "thus , for comparing with experimental data corresponding to a sc of finite size , in this section , we have calculated the modal shapes inside the double defect using multiple scattering theroy ( mst ) .",

    "moreover , the difference in the value of imaginary of complex wave vector is a direct evidence of the existence of different vibrational modes in multi - point defects and revels the existence of a coupling between them .",
    "usual calculations with plane wave expansion , @xmath1 methods , do not provide any information about the evanescent behaviour of the localized modes in point defects inside periodic structures . in this work we present the explicit matrix formulation of the extended plane wave expansion ( epwe ) with the supercell approximation for a supercell with @xmath4 point defects for sc .",
    "this technique allows us to study the evanescent behaviour of the modes inside sc with multipoint defects .",
    "localized modes in sc are mainly characterized by three properties : splitting of frequencies , the symmetry of the vibrational patterns and evanescent behaviour inside the crystal .",
    "epwe in addition to pwe both with supercell approximation have been used to analyze the whole properties of the localized modes in a sc with a double point defect .",
    "first we analyze the splitting produced by the generation of a double - point defect , showing the effects in both the real and imaginary band structures . from the imaginary complex band structure",
    "we obtain that the localized modes present different values for the imaginary part of @xmath0 , that means each mode has a different decay rate inside the crystal .",
    "this property has been observed experimentally by fitting the exponential decay for each localized mode inside the crystal .",
    "the symmetry of the vibrational patterns in double - point defect have also been analyzed in the paper by means of mst calculation and experimental data .",
    "novel experimental evidences show the symmetric and antisymmetric vibrational patterns in sc with double - point defects .",
    "these data are in very good agreement with analytical data .",
    "finally , using the different decay rate of both vibrational modes , we confirm our conclusions giving a new methodology to determine different vibrational modes in periodic media .",
    "this work shows the basis for the correct understanding of the design of narrow filters and wave guides based on periodic structures with multi - point defects .",
