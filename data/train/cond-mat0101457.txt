    "the study of halogenide adsorption on metal surfaces has become a very interesting field in surface science .",
    "important questions such as adsorption geometries and energetics have been addressed in experimental studies .",
    "the adsorption of chlorine on the ag(111 ) surface has been studied by various groups and with different techniques including low energy electron diffraction ( leed ) @xcite , surface extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( sexafs ) @xcite , auger spectroscopy @xcite , thermal desorption@xcite , measurements of adsorption isobars and isotherms @xcite , work function measurements @xcite and scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite .    however , there is still an ongoing discussion on the correct interpretation of the experiments .",
    "various explanations of observed adsorption patterns have been proposed , and the bond length has been measured twice with significantly different results @xcite .",
    "we recently presented a theoretical study of the chlorine adsorption on the cu(111 ) surface @xcite and we are therefore confident that simulation can shed some light on the difficult question of chlorine adsorption . as a test of our computational method",
    ", we performed additionally calculations on ag bulk and the clean surfaces .",
    "these are presented in section [ agbulksection ] .",
    "the question of chlorine adsorption is discussed in section [ chlorineadsorptionsection ] .",
    "we used a local basis set formalism where the basis functions are gaussian type orbitals centered at the atoms as implemented in the code crystal @xcite . in order to examine the effect of various treatments of electron exchange and correlation , we have used the local density approximation ( lda ) with dirac - slater exchange @xcite and the perdew - zunger correlation functional @xcite , the gradient corrected exchange and correlation functional of perdew and wang ( gga - pw ) @xcite and the gradient corrected functional of perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( gga - pbe ) @xcite .    for silver",
    ", we used a relativistic pseudopotential with corresponding basis set @xcite . for the calculation on the free atom",
    ", we used the original basis set . for the calculation on the solid and surfaces",
    ", we kept the inner exponents ( @xmath1 $ ] ) fixed and re - optimized the outermost exponents within the gga - pw approximation .",
    "values of 0.63 @xmath2 ( with the bohr radius @xmath3 ) and 0.11 @xmath2 for the @xmath4-exponents , 0.23 @xmath2 for the @xmath5-exponent and 0.18 @xmath2 for the @xmath6-exponent were obtained ( the most diffuse @xmath4-exponent could not be optimized and was kept fixed at a value of 0.11 @xmath2 to avoid numerical instabilities ) .",
    "this resulted as a whole in a @xmath7 $ ] basis set .",
    "the cl basis set is @xmath8 $ ] as used in our recent study of cl adsorption on cu(111 ) @xcite .",
    "the density functional potential was fitted with an auxiliary basis set , which consisted , for both ag and cl , of 12 @xmath4 and @xmath5 functions with exponents taken to be a geometrical sequence from 0.1 @xmath2 to 2000 @xmath2 . for cl",
    "5 @xmath6 functions with exponents in the range 0.8 @xmath2 to 100 @xmath2 were employed , for ag 8 @xmath6 and @xmath9 functions from 0.1 @xmath2 to 100 @xmath2 .",
    "we used a pack - monkhorst net of shrinking factor 16 for brillouin zone sampling , which resulted in 145 irreducible @xmath10-points for the bulk , 45 for the clean ( 100 ) surface , 81 for the clean ( 110 ) surface , 30 for the clean ( 111 ) surface , and 30 or 73 for the system cl / ag(111 ) , depending on the adsorption site ( 30 for hcp , 73 for fcc , bridge and atop site  an explanation of the sites is given in section [ chlorineadsorptionsection ] ; see also figure [ fort34-figure ] @xcite ) .",
    "a smearing temperature of 0.03 @xmath11 was applied to the fermi function ( @xmath11=27.2114 ev ) .",
    "this approach has been shown to give stable results for lithium bulk and surfaces @xcite as well as for the study of cl on the cu(111 ) surface @xcite .",
    "results for cohesive properties of bulk ag are in excellent agreement with those published in the literature ( table [ agbulktable ] ) . the tendency of the lda to overbind results in a short lattice constant , too high bulk modulus and too high binding energy .",
    "gga improves the binding energy and bulk modulus ; the deviation of the lattice constant is similar to lda ( with opposite sign , however ) .",
    "surface formation energies ( in @xmath11 per surface atom ) of the clean , unrelaxed surfaces are displayed in table [ agsurfsummtable ] .",
    "the surfaces were modeled with a finite number of ag layers ( typically from 1 to 7 ) ; this model was @xmath12 periodically repeated in space .",
    "the surface energy was found to be stable from three layers onwards .",
    "the bulk energy was computed with the same computational parameters ( basis set , shrinking factors , smearing temperature ) .",
    "lda binding energies are approximatively 50% higher than those obtained with gradient corrected functionals , which is higher than found in a previous study @xcite .",
    "gga - pw and gga - pbe turned out to give practically identical results in all cases which are in excellent agreement with the literature @xcite .",
    "the adsorption of cl on the ag(111 ) surface has been investigated by several groups .",
    "still , there is no agreement on adsorption patterns , coverages , preferred sites and bond lengths . in the first study with leed and auger spectroscopy @xcite , a @xmath0 pattern at low chlorine coverage and a @xmath13 pattern at higher coverage were observed . in a second study ,",
    "a @xmath0 pattern at a coverage of 1/3 and a @xmath14 pattern at a coverage of 0.49 were found @xcite . within an arrhenius model ,",
    "the binding energy was determined to be 0.080 @xmath15 .",
    "a similar energy was found in another experiment@xcite , but the leed pattern was interpreted as an epitaxial agcl layer .",
    "a @xmath0 pattern at a coverage close to one was found in ref . .",
    "scanning tunneling microscopy experiments have been interpreted as a parallel double row structure , where cl atoms occupy bridge and threefold hollow sites @xcite , or as @xmath16 overlayer at saturation @xcite .    a structural determination with sexafs gave a ag - cl bond length of 2.70 @xmath17 0.02   at a nominal coverage of 1/3 of a monolayer and 2.70 @xmath17 0.01   at a nominal coverage of 2/3 of a monolayer@xcite .",
    "cl was found to adsorb in threefold hollow sites in a @xmath0 pattern , for the higher coverage a vacancy honeycomb structure was proposed .",
    "this determination has been questioned in a recent article where a bond length of 2.48@xmath170.04   has been deduced from sexafs measurements for a nominal coverage of 1/3 of a monolayer@xcite . in this study",
    "an order - disorder transition was found at 195 k , below which a @xmath0 pattern at a coverage of 1/3 of a monolayer was identified in leed measurements ; this pattern was found to vanish above the transition temperature .",
    "in addition , a @xmath18 overlayer was identified at a coverage of 0.37 .",
    "the bond length of 2.48   was found to fit better with other bond lengths of chlorine adsorbates on 3@xmath6 and 4@xmath6 fcc metals .",
    "therefore , it was suggested that previous experiments should be reinterpreted .",
    "a variation of the bond length with coverage was neither found for cl on ag(111 ) @xcite nor for the similar system of i on rh(111 ) @xcite .",
    "these experimental observations therefore pose an interesting problem for simulation studies . in our calculations , we modeled the adsorption of cl on ag(111 ) as a slab periodic in two dimensions but with a finite thickness of three or four layers of silver .",
    "this was found to be sufficiently thick to obtain stable results for the surface energy of the clean ag(111 ) surface .",
    "the slab was covered by a layer of chlorine corresponding to a coverage of one third of a monolayer , in a @xmath0 pattern .",
    "cl was adsorbed in four different sites : the atop site on top of a silver atom in the top layer , the bridge site in the middle of two ag in the top layer , and hcp ( and fcc ) hollows where the chlorine sits in threefold hollow sites with a silver atom in the second ( third ) layer under the chlorine atom ( see figure [ fort34-figure ] ) . in the following ,",
    "all the calculations were performed at the gga - pw level , if not explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "the results of these calculations are summarized in table [ clonagtable ] .",
    "first , it turns out that the threefold hollow sites are lowest in energy , with the bridge site being about 0.003 @xmath11 higher and the atop site 0.017 @xmath11 higher in energy .",
    "this picture is quite similar to that of chlorine adsorption on the cu(111 ) surface @xcite .",
    "as the threefold sites are nearly degenerate in energy , we considered an improved model with four silver layers to investigate the dependence of the results with respect to the number of layers .",
    "it turns out that the fcc hollow stays lower in energy , although the energy difference is reduced from 0.001 @xmath11 ( three layers ) to only 0.0004 @xmath11 ( four layers ) .",
    "therefore , a fully reliable prediction of the adsorption site can not be made as more layers might still change this picture .",
    "the total adsorption energy is 0.111 @xmath11 per chlorine atom .",
    "we computed a dissociation energy @xmath19 @xmath11 , vibrational constant @xmath20 and internuclear distance @xmath21   for the chlorine dimer which is in reasonable agreement with experiment ( @xmath22=0.091 @xmath11 , @xmath23 , @xmath24=1.99  ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , our binding energy corresponds to 0.123 @xmath11 per @xmath25 when computed with respect to the @xmath25 molecule , using our computed binding energy for the chlorine dimer .",
    "this is higher than that deduced from thermal desorption experiments @xcite(0.080 @xmath11 ) and measurements of adsorption isobars and isotherms @xcite ( @xmath26 0.088 @xmath11 for the heat of adsorption of cl@xmath27 ) .",
    "however , the first experimental value depends on an empirical prefactor assumed in the arrhenius model and was questioned in ref . ; the authors stated that it should be higher as @xmath22 of the @xmath25 molecule because desorption as atomic cl was observed .",
    "another important aspect is the adsorption geometry .",
    "we allowed the top silver layer to relax vertically and a slight inwards relaxation by about 0.04   was found for all adsorption sites .",
    "the ag - cl bond length was determined to be 2.62   for the threefold hollow sites , 2.54   for the bridge site and 2.38   for the atop site .",
    "tests on the 4-layer slab demonstrated that these bond lengths are stable with respect to the number of layers .",
    "other tests such as varying the outermost diffuse exponents in the basis set or applying a smaller smearing temperature were performed , and it turned out that the bond length was also stable with respect to these parameters ; the variation was of the order @xmath17 0.02  .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the computed bond length is not highly sensitive to computational details .",
    "the remaining approximation in our simulations is the choice of the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "the effects of this choice were examined by recomputing the surface properties within the lda ( table [ clonagtablelda ] ) .",
    "lda gives the same preference of adsorption sites and a similar energy splitting .",
    "the adsorption energies are 20 - 25 @xmath28 higher than those computed using the gga - pw , and the bond lengths are shorter by 0.05 - 0.07  .",
    "the bond length computed with our model ( 2.62   in gga - pw , 2.55  in lda ) is intermediate between two controversial experiments ( 2.48 @xcite and 2.70 @xcite ) ; therefore we can not support either experiment over the other .    combining our data for cl on ag(111 ) and",
    "cl on cu(111 ) , we can comment on the effective radius of the cl adsorbate , under the assumption that both the chlorine adsorbate and the copper and silver surfaces are made of hard spheres . for the fcc site and cl on cu , a bond length of 2.40",
    "  was obtained .",
    "if we subtract the atomic radius of copper of @xmath29 , then we obtain a radius for cl of 1.12  .",
    "for cl on ag , we obtain a radius of @xmath30@xmath31= 1.17  .",
    "this radius for cl is intermediate between the atomic ( 0.99  ) and ionic ( cl@xmath32 ; 1.81  ) ) @xcite .",
    "the bond lengths predicted here and previously computed for the cu(111)-@xmath33-cl give a consistent picture of the radius of the adsorbed cl@xmath32 ion .",
    "the mulliken population analysis gave a slight charge transfer of 0.2 e to 0.25 @xmath34 to the chlorine atom , increasing in the order @xmath35 ; of course , one has to keep in mind that the error associated with this number is larger in the case of metals with diffuse basis functions because the diffuse cl basis functions can be used to partially describe ag states and vice versa .",
    "still , it is very interesting to compare the charge transfer with the position of the cl @xmath36 eigenvalue ( table [ clpopulationtable ] ) .",
    "if we assume that intra - atomic interactions dominate the core eigenvalues of the cl atom , then the position of the cl @xmath36 eigenvalue provides a measure of the atomic charge : the more negatively charged the cl ion , the lower the binding energy of the core eigenvalue . as this is related to the observable core level shift , it can provide an experimental mechanism for distinguishing adsorption sites .",
    "we observe this correlation in our results for different adsorption sites ( table [ clpopulationtable ] ) , but we find that this correlation is not retained when comparing cl adsorption on cu to that on ag .",
    "the @xmath36 eigenvalue is at lower binding energy for cl on the ag surface despite the cl charge being lower in magnitude than that of cl on the cu surface .",
    "this could be due to errors in the mulliken charge estimates which are more reliable within a consistent set of basis sets .",
    "the position of the cl levels is visible in the mulliken projected densities of states ( figures [ clonagdensity],[dosonclpxpypzbridge ] and [ agcuprojecteddos ] ) .",
    "first , we projected the density of states on the chlorine orbitals ( figure [ clonagdensity ] ) .",
    "the @xmath36 level moves as described to higher energies ( corresponding to lower binding energies ) with higher mulliken orbital populations .",
    "for all adsorption sites , the valence band contribution consists of a broad background from @xmath37 to @xmath38 which contains contributions from cl @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the peak at @xmath41 is due to @xmath42 and @xmath43 contributions in all cases ; there is no distinct peak from @xmath40 contributions .",
    "the @xmath42 peak and @xmath43 peak are virtually identical in the case of fcc , hcp or atop adsorption sites ; for the bridge site the @xmath44 peak carries more weight than the @xmath45 peak ( figure [ dosonclpxpypzbridge ] ) .",
    "these findings are consistent with orbital projected mulliken charges ( table [ clpxpypztable ] ) which are highest for @xmath45 and @xmath44 in the case of fcc , hcp and atop site . for the bridge site , the @xmath44 population is higher than @xmath45 and again higher than @xmath46  note that , in our choice of geometry , for the bridge site , the cl @xmath42 orbital overlaps more with the silver atoms in the top layer than the cl @xmath43 orbital ( see figure [ fort34-figure ] ) . we can therefore conclude that in all sites the charge transferred to the cl atom occupies those orbitals which have lowest overlap with the silver atoms .",
    "this is consistent with an ionic rather than covalent picture of the bonding .",
    "we note that these orbitals may be separately observed by exploiting the polarization dependence of angle resolved photoemission @xcite .",
    "when comparing the chlorine adsorption on silver with the chlorine adsorption on copper ( figure [ agcuprojecteddos ] ) , we find that the bandwidth of the 3@xmath5 states is similar ; as mentioned earlier the @xmath36 peak is at slightly higher energy for cl on ag than for cl on cu , although the charge is a bit smaller in magnitude ( -0.207 @xmath34 for copper vs -0.198 @xmath34 for silver ) .",
    "the peak structure is different from cl on ag(111 ) as we find one additional peak for cl @xmath40 ; the two other peaks carry equal weight from cl 3@xmath45 and cl 3@xmath44 . as in the case of silver ,",
    "the cl @xmath42 and @xmath43 orbitals carry slightly more charge than cl @xmath40 .",
    "finally , in figures [ chargedensitytotal ] and [ chargedensitydifference ] , we display the total charge density of cl adsorbed in the fcc hollow site and the charge density difference .",
    "the plane was chosen in such a way that the center of the chlorine atom , the center of one of the nearest neighbor silver atoms ( at a distance of 2.62  ) and the centers of two more silver atoms ( at a distance of 3.91  ) lie in the same plane .",
    "the charge density difference has been obtained by subtracting the charge densities of a clear ag slab ( with the geometry of the system ag(111)-@xmath33-cl ) and a layer of chlorine atoms from the charge density of the system after the chlorine adsorption .",
    "we find no evidence of bond formation in the charge density plots so that these plots support the idea of an ionic binding mechanism .",
    "a further evidence of an ionic bonding is the very small overlap population of @xmath26 0.01 @xmath34 between cl and the nearest silver atom .",
    "we have studied the adsorption of chlorine on the ag(111 ) surface using density functional theory calculations in which we have paid close attention to numerical accuracy .",
    "the fcc hollow site was found to be the preferred adsorption site , slightly lower in energy than the hcp site .",
    "the adsorption energy is computed to be 0.111 @xmath11 per atom with respect to free cl atoms or 0.123 @xmath11 per @xmath25 molecule .",
    "the computed ag - cl distance of 2.62   at the gga - pw level ( or 2.55   at the lda level ) are intermediate between two controversial values deduced from experiment .",
    "the bond length is consistent with that computed for cl on cu which would indicate an effective radius of the cl adsorbate of @xmath26 1.15  . for the different adsorption sites of cl on ag(111 ) , we find that the charge on chlorine is consistent with the relative position of the cl @xmath36 level , i.e. the higher the charge on cl , the lower the binding energy of the @xmath36 level",
    ". this might be valuable in the interpretation of core level shift observations . from projected densities of states , we conclude that the chlorine charge is larger in those orbitals which are most separated from silver which means that the character of the bond tends towards ionic rather than covalent . in our choice of geometry , the chlorine @xmath42 and @xmath43 orbitals have a slightly higher occupation than the chlorine @xmath40 orbital for the threefold hollow sites which might also be observable in photoemission experiments .",
