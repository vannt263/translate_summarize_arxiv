    "we see there are indeed three different field regimes that correspond to the expected metamagnetic transitions .",
    "first , at low fields @xmath74 t and including zero field , the sans temperature dependences share a common form , with intensity at low temperatures entering abruptly , rather like an order parameter with a transition temperature of @xmath75k .",
    "then , at an intermediate applied field of 1.5 t , the magnitude of this order - parameter - like response appears somewhat increased compared to the low field regime . finally at high fields",
    "@xmath76 t the sans intensity rises smoothly with falling temperature , and also increases with increasing field .    to understand the origin of the sans intensity appearing at low temperatures , we first consider the possibility that the sans signal at fields @xmath77 arises from superconducting vortices in the sample . to check for sharp bragg reflections from a well - defined superconducting vortex lattice , at selected low applied fields we also collected data as the samples were rocked through the expected bragg angles",
    "the field direction of the cryomagnet was initially aligned relative to the neutron beam using the vortex lattice in a nb single crystal .",
    "no angular dependence was observed in the rocking scans on our honi@xmath7b@xmath7c samples , precluding a well - defined vortex lattice . at zero field , a sans signal",
    "is observed even when no superconducting vortices are present ( no spontaneously forming vortices are anticipated because the magnetic ground state is antiferromagnetic ) .",
    "hence superconducting vortices , even in a disordered ensemble , can not account for the observed sans response .",
    "next we turn to the possibility that temperature - induced sans is generated by multiple bragg scattering between slightly misoriented crystallites in the samples .",
    "this possibility would be completely excluded by working at neutron wavelengths @xmath78 above the bragg cutoff @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the maximum @xmath81-spacing of the bragg diffraction planes . for honi@xmath7b@xmath7c , @xmath82 , corresponding to the @xmath83 magnetic bragg reflection that appears at @xmath8k in the commensurate nel state . unfortunately working at @xmath84",
    "is infeasible due to the lack of flux at these wavelengths at even the best of today s neutron facilities .",
    "instead we used @xmath85 .",
    "nonetheless we may defenestrate multiple bragg scattering since this usually manifests itself as isolated spots on the small - angle detector that typically change rapidly with rotations of the sample or with neutron wavelengths . here , in contrast , we observe a smooth sans profile ( c.f .",

    ", we find @xmath95 .",
    "the atomic form factor @xmath96 of the ho@xmath46 moments is essentially constant at low @xmath56 , and the sans profile probes directly how these moments arrange .",
    "the porod behaviour implies a network of interfaces or surfaces , with the @xmath94 signifying that these interfaces are smooth .",
    "our experiments do not probe sufficiently small scattering vectors to access the guinier regime of the @xmath97 profile and we therefore deduce a lower bound @xmath98  for the characteristic size @xmath99 of the network .    in the high field region , we find that the anisotropy of the temperature - induced sans is very similar to that of the crystallographic background , as characterized by the angular dependence of * q * measured over the 2d sans detector .",
    "the same can be said for the low field region , although here there are fewer counts with which to make this evaluation . like",
    "the temperature - induced foreground sans intensity , the crystallographic background exhibits a porod law @xmath100 , indicative of grain boundaries and dislocation surfaces .",
    "it is likely that the temperature - induced sans also originates at these crystal grain boundaries and dislocations . in the antiferromagnetic @xmath59 region at zero and low fields , we conjecture that the grain boundaries and dislocations serve as pinning sites for antiferromagnetic domain walls that carry a net magnetic moment . due to the crystal electric field , at high fields the ho@xmath46 moments",
    "align to the [ 110 ] direction that is nearest to the applied field * h * ; we postulate that additional small - angle scattering appears at decreasing temperatures from interfacial moments at the grain boundaries and dislocations that are susceptible to align directly along * h * instead of along @xmath16 $ ] . as mooted in sec .",
    "[ magnetizationsection ] , these free moments at extrinsic interfaces may also account for the discrepancies between the reported values of the paramagnetic magnetization for * h *  @xmath25  * c*.",
    "to summarize , we have performed magnetometry , transport and small - angle neutron scattering ( sans ) measurements on honi@xmath7b@xmath7c single crystals .",
    "additional sans intensity @xmath86 appearing at low temperatures is observed at all fields . in a low field region",
    "@xmath101 t that includes zero field , the temperature dependence of the signal is order - parameter - like with a transition at @xmath75k . at high fields @xmath102 t ,",
    "the sans increases continuously on cooling across the temperature range probed ( from @xmath19k to @xmath103k ) .    at low but finite fields , superconducting vortices will exist in the sample with an arrangement that is known to be rather disordered from previous local hall probe  @xcite and bitter decoration work  @xcite .",
    "sans @xmath97 profiles similar to those observed here were previously reported on polycrystalline sr@xmath104la@xmath105cuo@xmath0 and interpreted as scattering from disordered vortices  @xcite .",
    "such an interpretation can not account for our honi@xmath7b@xmath7c scattering data since we also observe a sans signal at zero field .",
    "the agreement between the observed field regimes and the expected metamagnetic transitions , plus the porod - law behaviour exhibited in @xmath97 , lead us to conclude that the low - temperature sans stems from uncompensated moments at crystallographic grain boundaries and dislocations . at low fields ,",
    "these uncompensated moments are associated with domain walls in the antiferromagnetic @xmath59 phase , while at high fields they are suggested to stem from paramagnetic moments at the interfaces that align along the field direction rather than along the nearest [ 110 ] easy axis in the bulk ferromagnetic structure .",
    "we emphasize that these magnetic structures form a network of large length scales @xmath98 .",
    "magnetic contrast over similar scales has already been observed in bitter decoration of non - superconducting tbni@xmath7b@xmath7c and of the normal state of erni@xmath7b@xmath7c  @xcite . in these high - resolution decoration studies ,",
    "the lamellar magnetic flux structures observed were thought to be linked to crystallographic twin boundaries by magnetoelastic stresses . in honi@xmath7b@xmath7c",
    "magnetoelastic effects lead to an orthorhombic distortion such that the unit cell length along the [ 110 ] ( tetragonal ) direction closest to * h * shrinks by @xmath106% compared to @xmath107 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "these large magnetoelastic strains would likely favour the location of magnetic domain walls at crystallographic grain boundaries and dislocations @xcite .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to explore , in future work , the physics of antiferromagnetic magnetoelastic domain wall boundaries using high - resolution microscopy techniques in honi@xmath7b@xmath7c and in other materials .",

    "<S> the superconducting and magnetic properties of honi@xmath0b@xmath0c single crystals are investigated through transport , magnetometry and small - angle neutron scattering measurements . in the magnetic phases that enter below the superconducting critical temperature , the small - angle neutron scattering data uncover networks of magnetic surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> these likely originate from uncompensated moments e.g.  at domain walls pinned to crystallographic grain boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> the field and temperature dependent behaviour appears consistent with the metamagnetic transitions reported in earlier works . </S>"
