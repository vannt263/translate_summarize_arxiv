    "inconsistency measuring is helpful to compare different knowledge bases and to evaluate their quality @xcite .",
    "a number of logic - based inconsistency measures have been studied , including the maximal @xmath0-consistency @xcite , measures based on variables or via multi - valued models @xcite , n - consistency and n - probability @xcite , minimal inconsistent subsets based inconsistency measures @xcite , shapley inconsistency value @xcite , and more recently the inconsistency measurement based on minimal proofs @xcite .",
    "there are different ways to categorize the proposed measures .",
    "one way is with respect to their dependence on syntax or semantics : semantic based ones aim to compute the proportion of the language that is affected by the inconsistency , via for example paraconsistent semantics .",
    "whilst , syntax based ones are concerned with the minimal number of formulae that cause inconsistencies , often through minimal inconsistent subsets .",
    "different measures can also be classified by being formula or knowledge base oriented .",
    "for example , the inconsistency measures in @xcite consist in quantifying the contribution of a formula to the inconsistency of a whole knowledge base containing it , while the other mentioned measures aim to quantify the inconsistency degree a the whole knowledge base . some basic properties @xcite such as _ consistency , monotony , free formula independence _",
    ", are also proposed to evaluate the quality of inconsistency measures .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a syntax - based framework to measure inconsistencies using a novel methodology allowing to resolve inconsistencies in a parallel way . to this end , _",
    "distributable mus - decomposition _ and _ distribution index _ of a kb are introduced .",
    "intuitively , a distributable mus - decomposition gives a reasonable partition of a kb such that it allows multiple experts to solve inconsistencies in parallel ; and the distribution index is the maximal components that a kb can be partitioned into .",
    "this methodology is of great importance in a scenario where the information in a kb is precious , large , and complex such that removing or weakening information requires intensive and time - consuming interactions with human experts .",
    "consider @xmath1 .",
    "intuitively , @xmath2 contains a large number of inconsistencies . and interestingly",
    ", our approach can recognize @xmath3 as @xmath4 distributable parts of @xmath2 such that each expert can focus on verifying a single part carefully and independently .",
    "in contrast , classical approaches follow the idea of resolving inconsistency as a whole without being able to break a kb into independent pieces .",
    "take , for example , the classical hitting set approach which identifies a minimal set of formulae , e.g. @xmath5 of @xmath2 , to remove for restoring consistency .",
    "note that @xmath2 has many such hitting sets of a big size @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , even if working in parallel , each expert needs to verify a large number of formulae , which is time consuming . more problematic in general , there are often overlaps among hitting sets so that multiple experts have to waste time in unnecessarily rechecking the overlaps .",
    "this is the same if we simply distribute one minimal inconsistent subsets to an expert .",
    "however , the proposed distributable mus - decomposition avoids this problem because it gives a disjoint decomposition of a kb .",
    "the methodology is inspired and a side - product of our exploration of the _ decomposition _ property defined for inconsistency measures , which is rarely discussed in the literature due to its modeling difficulty @xcite .",
    "our technical contributions are as follows :    * we propose _ independent decomposability _ as a more reasonable characterization of inconsistency measures .",
    "* we define a _ graph representation _ of kbs to analyze connections between minimal inconsistent subsets by exploiting the structure of the graph .",
    "such a representation is then used to improve an existing inconsistency measure to satisfy the independent decomposability . *",
    "based on the graph representation , a series of _ mus - decompositions _ are introduced and used for defining the _ distribution - based inconsistency measure @xmath6_. we show the interesting properties of @xmath6 and give a comparison with other measures , which indicates its rationality . * we study the complexity of @xmath6 ( via an _ extended set packing problem _ ) and we provide encodings as a 0/1 linear program or min cost satisfiability for its computation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sections [ sec : preliminaries ] and [ sec : miv ] give basis notions and recall some inconsistency measures relevant to the present work . in section [ sec : partition ] , we propose a graph representation of a kb and use it to revise an existing measure . section [ sec : kbmeasure ] focuses on _ mus - decomposition _ and _ distribution - based inconsistency measure_. section [ sec : computation ] gives the complexity results of the proposed measure and its computation algorithms whose efficiency is evaluated in section [ sec : experiments ] .",
