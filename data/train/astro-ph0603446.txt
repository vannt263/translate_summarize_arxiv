    "apart from the classic sweep of the polarization position angle across a pulsar s average profile , the orthogonal polarization modes ( opm ) are perhaps the most striking feature in the polarization of pulsar radio emission .",
    "the modes appear in bimodal histograms of polarization position angle as two concentrations of data points separated by about @xmath0 ( e.g. stinebring et al .",
    "the modes are elliptically as well as orthogonally polarized , so that the polarization states of the modes reside at antipodal points on the poincar sphere ( cordes et al . 1978 ) .",
    "opm are thought to arise from wave propagation effects in the magnetized plasma above the pulsar s polar cap ( e.g. allen & melrose 1982 ; barnard & arons 1986 ) .",
    "the simultaneous interaction of the modes may be responsible for the depolarization of the emission at high radio frequency ( manchester et al .",
    "1975 ; morris et al .",
    "1981 ) .",
    "the notion that opm are elliptically polarized suggests that the emission s linear and circular polarization should be analyzed together , instead of individually , for a proper interpretation of pulsar polarization measurements ( mckinnon 2003 ; hereafter m03 ) .",
    "comprehensive methods have been developed recently for displaying and analysing the polarization data in this way .",
    "for example , karastergiou et al . ( 2003 ) plotted the measured orientation angles of a pulsar s polarization vector in a hammer - aitoff projection , confirming the association of circular polarization handedness with opm in psr b1133 + 16 .",
    "similarly , edwards & stappers ( 2004 ; hereafter es04 ) displayed the vector s orientation angles in a lambert equal - area projection to document and explore the intriguing deviations from mode orthogonality in psr b0329 + 54 .",
    "they also showed that the circular polarization in the pulsar is generally consistent with an origin in elliptically polarized opm .",
    "mckinnon & stinebring ( 1998 , 2000 ) developed a statistical model of superposed opm that predicts that polarization measurements at a given pulse longitude should form a single , prolate ellipsoid in the three - dimensional space defined by the stokes parameters q , u , and v. the prediction is generally supported by the analyses conducted by mckinnon ( 2004 ; hereafter m04 ) and es04 , who independently developed eigenvalue techniques to quantify the dimensions and orientations of the ellipsoids .",
    "while the eigenvalue analyses and the projections of polarization vector angles are generally supportive of the superposed opm hypothesis , it has yet to be demonstrated that the observed orientation angles are consistent with those predicted by the opm statistical model .",
    "the statistics of the orientation angles derived in m03 are limited in their applicability , primarily because they are restricted to the specific case of opm with equal polarization amplitudes .",
    "the objectives of this paper are to derive a general distribution for a polarization vector s orientation angles by expanding the work of m03 and to compare the theoretical distribution with the distributions of observed orientation angles .",
    "the derivation is presented in  [ sec : angles ] , and the comparison is made in  [ sec : compare ] .",
    "conclusions are discussed in  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "the joint probability density of a polarization vector s amplitude , colatitude , and longitude must be determined from the stokes parameters to calculate the individual distributions of the orientation angles . from the statistical model of pulsar polarization ( m03 ) ,",
    "the equations for the measured stokes parameters are @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3    the random variables @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the amplitudes of the mode polarization vectors .",
    "they have means @xmath6 and @xmath7 and standard deviations @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in general , @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "can be correlated random variables , but they are assumed to be independent in what follows .",
    "the gaussian random variable @xmath10 accounts for the instrumental noise .",
    "it has a zero mean and a standard deviation @xmath11 .",
    "the fixed angles @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the colatitude and longitude , respectively , of the diagonal in the poincar sphere along which the fluctuations in pulsar - intrinsic polarization occur .",
    "the angles correspond to twice the ellipticity and twice the position angle , respectively , of the polarization vector ( i.e. @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the nomenclature of es04 ) .",
    "as discussed in m04 , the emission may contain additional components , such as randomly polarized radiation ( rpr ) .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , these components are neglected , or alternatively , assumed to be absorbed in the @xmath10 terms provided that their fluctuations are gaussian with a zero mean and that their q - u - v covariance matrix is a scaled identity matrix .",
    "the basic shape of a data point cluster formed by the equations for the stokes parameters is a prolate ellipsoid .",
    "the orientation of the ellipsoid s major axis is determined by @xmath12 and @xmath13 . to simplify the derivation of the joint probability density of a polarization vector s amplitude and orientation , it is convenient to specify @xmath16 so that the ellipsoid is symmetric about the z - axis in a conventional cartesian coordinate system . by virtue of this symmetry ,",
    "the longitude of the polarization vector is uniformly distributed over the interval @xmath17 , and the longitude and colatitude distributions are statistically independent . since the ellipsoid retains its shape on rotation , measured distributions of colatitude and longitude can be compared with the theoretical result by determining the orientation of the measured ellipsoid s major axis , rotating the q - u - v data points that form the ellipsoid via matrix multiplication so that the major axis of the rotated ellipsoid is aligned with the z - axis , and computing histograms of the rotated values of colatitude and longitude .    when @xmath16 and when the mode polarization amplitudes , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are independent , gaussian random variables , the joint probability density of the measured polarization vector s amplitude and orientation is    @xmath18 .",

    "but at locations where @xmath55 , the mean stokes parameters will be small , and consequently equations  [ eqn : phi ] and  [ eqn : theta ] will produce poor estimates of @xmath13 and @xmath12 . alternatively , one could compute the covariances of the stokes parameters , and the directional cosines of the principal eigenvector of the 3x3 covariance matrix could be used to estimate @xmath13 and @xmath12",

    "histograms of the measured values of colatitude and longitude were computed at different locations within the pulse of psr b2020 + 28 using the 1404 mhz single pulse , polarization observations of stinebring et al .",

    "the resulting values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 were used in equation  [ eqn : rotate ] to rotate the q - u - v data points that formed the polarization ellipsoid .",
    "finally , the rotated stokes parameters were used to calculate corresponding values of colatitude and longitude , which were binned into 50 intervals spread over the appropriate range of angles to form the histograms .",

    "the solid horizontal line in each of the longitude histogram panels represents the uniform distribution expected from the opm statistical model .",
    "the generally good agreement between the theoretical and measured longitude distributions , combined with the observation that the ratios of the minor axes of the q - u - v data point clusters are no larger than 1.09 at these locations within the pulse ( m04 ) , suggests that the polarization ellipsoids are rotationally symmetric about their major axes .",
    "the observed symmetry of the ellipsoids also suggests that the longitude and colatitude of the polarization vector are statistically independent , as predicted by the opm statistical model .",
    "however , the symmetry does not rule out the possibility that @xmath60 and @xmath26 can be correlated or dependent upon one another .",
    "indeed , the deviations from orthogonality documented in es04 and m04 are evidence that the two angles can be correlated .",

    "the excellent fits show that equation  [ eqn : gencolat ] is capable of representing a broad range of polarization behavior .",
    "furthermore , these fits and the measurements of cluster dimensions by m04 together imply that the clusters are nt just any ellipsoids , but the ellipsoids expected from the opm statistical model , suggesting quantitative , in addition to qualitative , consistency between the model and the data .",
    "the data used to construct the histograms had significant circular polarization , and the ellipsoidal shape of the q - u - v data point clusters illustrates the association of circular polarization handedness with opm in psr 2020 + 28 , similar to what was found in psr 1133 + 16 by karastergiou et al .",

    ". however , the sizes of the ellipsoids minor axes , and thus the effective noise of the observations , are much larger than the off - pulse noise , causing the lower - than - expected values of @xmath25 .",

    "the statistical model of pulsar polarization developed by mckinnon & stinebring ( 1998 ) predicts that multiple measurements of the variable stokes parameters at a fixed pulse longitude will form a single , prolate ellipsoid in poincar space .",
    "the analyses presented in es04 and m04 show that q - u - v data point clusters in psr b0329 + 54 , psr b1929 + 10 , and psr b2020 + 28 are indeed prolate ellipsoids . in this paper ,",
    "the favorable comparison between the theoretical and measured distributions of polarization vector colatitude and longitude in psr b2020 + 28 suggest that the data point clusters are consistent with the ellipsoid expected from the model .",
    "this implies quantitative consistency between the model and the data , and supports the fundamental , underlying assumption of the statistical model which is the observed polarization is determined by the simultaneous interaction of two , orthogonally polarized modes .    the analysis of orientation angles presented here and the observations and analyses of cordes et al .",

    "( 2003 ) , and es04 clearly demonstrate the association of circular polarization handedness with opm , confirming that the modes are elliptically polarized and occupy antipodal points on the poincar sphere . this result could be interpreted to conclude that the circular polarization is formed by the appropriate phasing of the naturally occurring , linearly polarized modes through mode coupling ( e.g. lyubarskii & petrova 1998 ; petrova 2001 ) as the radiation propagates through the pulsar s magnetospheric plasma .",
    "if this were the case , we would only observe circular polarization in parts of the pulse where both modes were found .",
    "however , there are clear examples of circular polarization where only one mode occurs ( e.g. top left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:6hist ] and fig . 3 of m04 ) .",
    "so , unless one mode just so happens to be completely coupled \" in the process of creating circular polarization , other propagation effects , such as the gyrotropy of the magnetospheric plasma , or cyclotron absorption ( melrose 2003 ) must be responsible for the production of circular polarization in the radio emission .    karastergiou et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and es04 displayed the orientation angles of the polarization vector at a fixed pulse longitude using hammer - aitoff and lambert equal - area projections .",
    "the colatitude and longitude histograms computed in  [ sec : compare ] are simply another method for conveying the same information .",
    "both the projections and the histograms effectively illustrate the fluctuations in the colatitude and longitude of the emission s polarization vector .",
    "a comprehensive version of the conditional density for the polarization vector s orientation angles was derived . in its limiting forms",
    ", the conditional density follows the watson bipolar distribution when the polarization amplitude is small ( @xmath63 ) and follows the fisher distribution when the polarization fluctuations are small compared to the effective noise ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "since both the watson and fisher distributions have many applications in the statistical analysis of scientific data ( m03 ) , the comprehensive version of the conditional density given by equation  [ eqn : comp ] may have more widespread applications .",
    "the small values of polarization signal - to - noise ratio found in the orientation angle analysis and the inflated q - u - v data point clusters found by m04 and es04 are reminders that the effective noise of single pulse , polarization observations is much larger than the noise measured off the pulse",
    ". the additional noise may be due to rpr . the colatitude distribution ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : gencolat ] ) was derived assuming gaussian fluctuations in mode polarization amplitudes , and it is remarkable that the equation fits the data so well , regardless of the actual type of pulsar - intrinsic polarization fluctuations . perhaps the good match between equation and data can be attributed to the idea that the observed fluctuations are heavily influenced by the large , effective gaussian noise .",
    "the caution to interject here is that we are sifting through a large effective noise component in analyzing these data , irrespective of how low the off - pulse noise might be .",
    "consequently , it is important to account for the effective noise in statistical models so that the data can be properly interpreted ."
