    "cell lineage data consist of observations of some quantitative characteristic of the cells ( e.g. their length , growth rate , time until division ,  ) over several generations descended from an initial cell .",
    "track is kept of the genealogy to study the inherited effects on the evolution of the characteristic .",
    "as a cell usually gives birth to two offspring by division , such genealogies are structured as binary trees . @xcite",
    "first adapted autoregressive processes to this binary tree structure by introducing bifurcating autoregressive processes ( bar ) .",
    "this parametric model takes into account both the environmental and inherited effects .",
    "inference on this model has been proposed based on either a single - tree growing to infinity , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or for an asymptotically infinite number of small replicated trees , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite .",
    "more recently , studies of aging in single cell organisms by @xcite suggested that cell division may not be symmetric .",
    "an asymmetric bar model was therefore proposed by @xcite , where the two sets of parameters corresponding to sister cells are allowed to be different .",
    "inference for this model was only investigated for single - trees growing to infinity , see @xcite , @xcite for the fully observed model or @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for missing data models .",
    "cell division data often consist in recordings over several genealogies of cells evolving in similar experimental conditions .",
    "for instance , @xcite filmed 94 colonies of escherichia coli cells dividing between four and nine times .",
    "we therefore propose a new rigorous approach to take into account all the available information . indeed",
    ", we propose an inference based on a finite fixed number of replicated trees when the total number of observed cells tends to infinity .",
    "we use the missing data asymmetric bar model introduced by @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the observed genealogies are modeled with a two - type galton - watson ( gw ) process . however , we propose a different least - squares estimator for the parameters of the bar process that does not correspond to the single - tree estimators averaged on the replicated trees .",
    "we also propose an estimator of the parameters of the gw process specific to our binary tree structure and not based simply on the observation of the number of cells of each type in each generation as in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we study the consistency and asymptotic normality of our estimators and derive asymptotic confidence intervals as well as wald s type tests to investigate the asymmetry of the data for both the bar and gw processes .",
    "our results are applied to the escherichia coli data of @xcite .",
    "we also provide an empirical study of the convergence rate of our estimators and of the power of the symmetry tests on simulated data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s :",
    "methodo ] , we describe a methodology for least - squares estimation based on multiple data sets in a general framework . in section  [ s : model ] , we present the bar and observations models . in section  [",
    "s : inference ] we give our estimators and state their asymptotic properties . in section  [",
    "s : data ] , we propose a new investigation of @xcite data . in section  [ s : simu ] we give simulation results .",
    "the precise statement of the convergence results , the explicit form of the asymptotic variance of the estimators and the convergence proofs are postponed to the appendix .",
    "we work with the following general framework .",
    "consider that several data sets are available , obtained in similar experimental conditions and then assumed to come from the same parametric model .",
    "suppose that there exists a consistent least - squares estimator for the parametric model .",
    "this estimator can be computed on each individual data set , but we would like to take into account all the data at disposal , which should improve the accuracy of the estimation .    to this aim , we assume that the different data sets are independent realizations of the parametric model . a natural idea is to average the single - set estimators .",
    "it may be a good approach if the single - set estimators have roughly the same variance , which is usually the case when the data sets have the same size .",
    "however , if the data sets have very different sizes , the single - set estimators may have variances of different orders and this direct approach becomes dubious .",
    "instead , we propose to use a global least - squares estimator .",
    "suppose that we have @xmath0 data sets .",
    "let @xmath1 be the ( possibly multivariate ) parameter to be estimated , and @xmath2 the least - squares estimator build with the @xmath3-th data set for @xmath4 .",
    "the global least - squares estimator @xmath5 decomposes as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a normalizing matrix and @xmath8 a vector of the same size as @xmath1 , involved in the decomposition of the single - set least - squares estimator @xmath2 as follows @xmath9 note that the estimator @xmath5 thus constructed is neither an average nor a function of the @xmath2 .",
    "hence , the asymptotic behavior of the global estimator @xmath5 can not be deduced from that of the single - set estimators @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath2 is often obtained through the convergence of the normalizing matrices @xmath7 and of the vectors @xmath8 separately , which gives the convergence of the global estimator @xmath5 as the number @xmath0 of data sets is fixed .",
    "note that the asymptotic is not the number @xmath0 of data sets .",
    "the aim of this paper is to apply this methodology to cell division data with missing data . in this special case ,",
    "the convergence of the global estimator @xmath5 is not straightforward , because we have to prove it on a set where the convergence of each @xmath7 and @xmath8 is not ensured .",
    "our aim is to estimate the parameters of coupled bar and gw processes through @xmath0 i.i.d .",
    "realizations of the processes .",
    "we first define our parametric model and introduce our notations .",
    "the bar and gw processes have the same dynamics as in @xcite , the main difference is that our inference is here based on several i.i.d .",
    "realizations of the processes , instead of a single one .",
    "additional notations together with the precise technical assumptions are specified in [ s : apx1 ] .",
    "consider @xmath0 i.i.d .",
    "replications of the asymmetric bar process with coefficient @xmath10@xmath11 .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath4 , the first cell in genealogy @xmath3 is labelled @xmath12 and for @xmath13 , the two offspring of cell @xmath14 are labelled @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "as we consider an asymmetric model , each cell has a _ type _ defined by its label : @xmath15 has type _ even _ and @xmath16 has type _ odd_. the characteristic of cell @xmath17 in genealogy @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "the bar processes are defined recursively as follows : for all @xmath19 and @xmath13 , one has @xmath20 let us also define the variance and covariance of the noise sequence @xmath21,\\qquad \\sigma_1 ^ 2={\\mathbb{e}}[\\varepsilon_{(j,2k+1)}^2],}\\qquad \\rho={\\mathbb{e}}[\\varepsilon_{(j,2k)}\\varepsilon_{(j,2k+1)}].\\ ] ] our goal is to estimate the parameters @xmath10@xmath22 and @xmath23 , and then test if @xmath24 or not .",
    "we now turn to the observation process @xmath25 that encodes for the presence or absence of cell measurements in the available data @xmath26 to take into account possible asymmetry in the observation process , we use a two - type galton - watson model .",
    "the relevance of this model to e. coli data is discussed in section  [ s : data ] .",
    "again , we suppose all the @xmath0 observation processes to be drawn independently from the same two - type gw process . more precisely , for all @xmath4 , we model the observation process @xmath27 for the @xmath3-th genealogy as follows .",
    "we set @xmath28 and draw @xmath29 independently from one another with a law depending on the type of cell @xmath17 .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath30 , if @xmath17 is of type @xmath31 we set @xmath32 @xmath33 for all @xmath34 .",
    "thus , @xmath35 is the probability that a cell of type @xmath31 has @xmath36 daughter of type @xmath37 and @xmath38 daughter of type @xmath39 . and",
    "if a cell is missing , its descendants are missing as well .",
    "figure [ f : tree ] gives an example of realization of an observation process .",
    "we also assume that the observation processes are independent from the bar processes .",
    "our first goal is to estimate the reproduction probabilities @xmath35 of the gw process from the @xmath0 genealogies of observed cells up to the @xmath40-th generation to be able to test the symmetry of the gw model itself .",
    "our second goal is to estimate @xmath41 from all the observed individuals of the @xmath0 trees up to the @xmath40-th generation .",
    "we then give the asymptotic properties of our estimator to be able to build confidence intervals and symmetry tests for @xmath42 .",
    "denote by @xmath43 the total number of observed cells in the @xmath0 trees up to the @xmath40-th generation of offspring from the original ancestors , and let @xmath44 be the non - extinction set , on which the global cell population grows to infinity .",
    "thus , our asymptotic results only hold on the set @xmath45 .",
    "this global non - extinction set is the union and not the intersection of the non - extinction sets of each single - tree .",
    "it means that some trees may extinct , which allows us to take into account trees with a different number of observed generations .",
    "we are thus in a case where averaging single - tree estimators is not recommended .",
    "the possibility of extinction for some trees is also the reason why the convergence of the multiple - trees estimator @xmath5 is not straightforward from existing results in the literature .",
    "conditions for the probability of non - extinction to be positive are given in  [ s : apx1 ] .",
    "there are many references on the inference of a multi - type gw process , see for instance @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our context of estimation is very specific because the information given by @xmath25 is more precise than that given by the number of cells of each type in a given generation that is usually used in the literature .",
    "indeed , not only do we know the number of cells of each type in each generation , but we also know their precise positions on the binary tree of cell division .",
    "the empiric estimators of the reproduction probabilities using data up to the @xmath40-th generation are then , for @xmath46 in @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and if the denominator is non zero , the estimator equalling zero otherwise .",
    "note that the numerator is just the number of cells of type @xmath31 in all the trees up to generation @xmath51 that have exactly @xmath36 daughter of type @xmath37 and @xmath38 daughter of type @xmath39 in the @xmath40-th generation .",
    "the denominator is the total number of cells of type @xmath31 in all the trees up to generation @xmath51 .",
    "set also @xmath52 the vector of the @xmath53 reproduction probabilities for a mother of type @xmath31 , @xmath54 the vector of all @xmath55 reproduction probabilities and @xmath56 its empirical estimator .      for the parameters of the bar process , we use the standard least - squares ( ls ) estimator @xmath57 with all the available data from the @xmath0 trees up to generation @xmath40 .",
    "it minimizes @xmath58 consequently , for all @xmath59 we have @xmath60 with @xmath61 where , for @xmath62 we defined @xmath63 note that in the normalizing matrices @xmath64 the sum is over all observed cells for which a daughter of type @xmath31 is observed , and not merely over all observed cells . to estimate the variance parameters @xmath65 and",
    "@xmath66 , we define the empiric residuals . for all @xmath67 and @xmath4 set @xmath68",
    "we propose the following empirical estimators @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the set of all cells which have at least one offspring of type @xmath31 , for @xmath62 and @xmath71 is the set of all the cells which have exactly two offspring , in the @xmath0 trees up to generation @xmath40 .",
    "we now state the convergence results we obtain for the estimators above .",

    ", one can naturally construct confidence intervals and tests .",
    "their explicit formulas are given in  [ ss : cigw ] and [ ss : cibar ] .",
    "we applied our procedure to the escherichia coli data of @xcite .",
    "the biological issue addressed is aging in single cell organisms .",
    "e. coli is a rod - shaped bacterium that reproduces by dividing in the middle .",
    "each cell has thus a new _ pole _",
    "( due to the division of its mother ) and an old one ( one of the two poles of its mother ) .",
    "the cell that inherits the old pole of its mother is called the _ old pole _ cell , the other one is called the _ new pole _ cell .",
    "therefore , each cell has a _ type _ : old pole or new pole cell , inducing asymmetry in the cell division . on a binary tree",
    ", the new pole cells are labelled by an even number and the old pole cells by an odd number .",
    "@xcite filmed 94 colonies of dividing e. coli cells , determining the complete lineage and the growth rate of each cell .",
    "the number of divisions goes from four to nine .",
    "the 94 data sets gather @xmath84 data ( 11189 of type even and 11205 of type odd ) .",
    "not a single data tree is complete .",
    "missing data mainly do not come from cell death ( only 16 cells are recorded to die ) but from measurement difficulties due mostly to overlapping cells or cells wandering away from the field of view .",
    "note also that for a growth rate to be recorded , the cell needs to be observed through its whole life cycle .",
    "if this is not the case , there is no record at all , so that a censored data model is not relevant . the observed average growth rate of even ( resp .",
    "odd ) cells is 0.0371 ( resp .",
    "these data were investigated in @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a statistical study of the averaged genealogy and pair - wise comparison of sister cells .",
    "they concluded that the old pole cells exhibit cumulatively slowed growth , less offspring biomass production and an increased probability of death whereas single - experiment analyses did not .",
    "however they assumed independence between the averaged couples of sister cells , which does not hold in such genealogies .",
    "the other studies are based on single - tree analyses instead of averaging all the genealogical trees .",
    "@xcite model the growth rate by a markovian bifurcating process , but their procedure does not take into account the dependence between pairs of sister cells either .",
    "the asymmetry was rejected ( p - value@xmath85 ) in half of the experiments so that a global conclusion was difficult .",
    "@xcite has then investigated the asymptotical properties of a more general asymmetric markovian bifurcating autoregressive process , and he rigorously constructed a wald s type test to study the asymmetry of the process .",
    "however , his model does not take into account the possibly missing data from the genealogies .",
    "the author investigates the method on the 94 data sets but it is not clear how he manages missing data .",
    "more recently , @xcite proposed a single - tree analysis with a rigorous method to deal with the missing data and carried out their analysis on the largest data set , concluding to asymmetry on this single set .",
    "further single - tree studies of the 51 data sets issued from the 94 colonies containing at least 8 generations were conducted in @xcite .",
    "the symmetry hypothesis is rejected in one set out of four for @xmath24 and one out of eight for @xmath86 forbidding a global conclusion .",
    "simulation studies tend to prove that the power of the tests on single - trees is quite low for only eight or nine generations .",
    "this is what motivated the present study and urged us to use all the data available in one global estimation , rather than single - tree analyses .    in this section ,",
    "we propose a new investigation of e. coli data of @xcite where for the first time the dependence structure between cells within a genealogy is fully taken into account , missing data are taken care of rigorously , all the available data , i.e. the 94 sets , are analyzed at once and both the growth rate and the number / type of descendants are investigated .",
    "it is sensible to consider that all the data sets correspond to bar processes with the same coefficients as the experiments where conducted in similar conditions .",
    "moreover , a direct comparison of single - tree estimations would be meaningless as the data trees do not all have the same number of generations , and it would be impossible to determine whether variations in the computed single - tree estimators come from an intrinsic variability between trees or just the low accuracy of the estimators for small trees .",
    "the original estimation procedure described in section  [ s : methodo ] enables us to use all the information available without the drawbacks of low accuracy for estimators or low power for tests on small single - trees .",
    "we now give the results of our new investigation of the e. coli growth rate data of @xcite .",
    "we suppose that the growth rate of cells in each lineage is modeled by the bar process defined in eq .",
    "( [ defbar ] ) and observed through the two - type gw process defined in section [ ss : gw ] .",
    "the experiments were independent and lead in the same conditions corresponding to independence and identical distribution of the processes @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "we first give the point and interval estimation for the various parameters of the bar process .",
    "table [ tab:1 ] gives the estimation @xmath89 of @xmath1 with the 95% confidence interval ( ci ) of each coefficient together with an estimation of @xmath90 .",
    "this value is interesting in itself as @xmath90 is the fixed point of the equation @xmath91=a_i+b_i{\\mathbb{e}}[x_i]$ ] .",
    "thus it corresponds to the asymptotic mean growth rate of the cells in the lineage always inheriting the new pole from the mother ( @xmath92 ) or always inheriting the old pole ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the confidence intervals of @xmath94 and @xmath95 show that the _ non explosion _",
    "assumption @xmath96 and @xmath97 is satisfied .",
    "note that although the number of observed generations @xmath98 may seem too small to obtain the consistency of our estimators , theorem [ th : tcl ] shows that their variance is of order @xmath99 . here",

    "however , it is not possible to interpret this asymmetry in terms of the division of e. coli , since the cause of missing data is mostly due to observation difficulties rather than some intrinsic behavior of the cells .",
    "to investigate the empirical rate of convergence of our estimators as well as the power of the symmetry tests we have performed simulations of our coupled bar - gw model . in particular , we study how they depend both on the ratio of missing data and on the number of observed generations .    in a complete binary tree ,",

    "an immediate application is the investigation of asymmetry in cell lineage data .",
    "this model of coupled gw - bar process generalizes all the previous methods on this subject in the literature because it rigorously takes into account :    * the dependence of the characteristic of a cell to that of its mother and the correlation between two sisters through the bar model , * the possibly missing data through the gw model , * the information from several sets of data obtained in similar experimental conditions without the drawbacks of poor accuracy or power for small single - trees .",
    "furthermore , we propose the estimation of parameters of a two - type gw process in the specific context of a binary tree with a fine observation , namely the presence or absence of each cell of the complete binary tree is known . in the context where missing offspring really come from the intrinsic reproduction , and not from faulty measures ,",
    "the asymmetry of the parameters of the gw process can be applied to cell lineage data and be interpreted as a difference in the reproduction laws between the two different types of cell .",
