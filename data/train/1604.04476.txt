    "mm - wave rotational transitions in the 3 mm band are the workhorses of interstellar chemistry and molecular line radioastronomy .",
    "their analysis usually consists of a combined excitation / radiative transfer calculation that derives a set of rotational excitation temperatures , optical depths and emergent line intensities as for instance outlined in the widely used large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approximation by @xcite and embodied in various standard tools like radex and the meudon pdr code ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "a comprehensive review of the constituent steps is given by @xcite .    because the analysis is cast in terms of excitation temperatures and optical depths , discussion of the practical observability of a species or transition",
    "is often expressed in terms of the so - called critical density that is sufficient to excite the transition above the cosmic microwave background ( which peaks in the 3 mm band ) .",
    "although somewhat loosely defined , a typical use of the critical density equates the downward collision rate of the upper level of a transition to its spontaneous emission rate .",
    "@xcite defines the optically - thin critical density by equating the spontaneous emission rate to the total rate of excitation , up and down , out of a given level .",
    "critical densities are often quite large , eg @xmath2 and much higher than the densities that are derived from detailed analysis of quite bright lines .",
    "@xcite shows how the estimates of the required density can be decreased when other considerations , for instance radiative trapping , are included .",
    "here we develop an alternative approach to calculating the brightness of molecular transitions when the density is far below the critical density , an approach that was first introduced by @xcite and subsequently elaborated for the j=1 - 0 transition of hcn by @xcite .",
    "some aspects of this methodology have been cited in the interpretation of sub - mm observations of water @xcite and the two - level fine - structure excitation of c  @xcite but they are much less commonly recognized in the context of mm - wave transitions . in any case , the formalism is broader , more powerful and more generally useful than is apparent from these earlier references , as we hope will be made clear in this work .    given that the critical density is so high , this approach is applicable even to fairly dense gas under conditions of appreciable optical depth .",
    "the underlying physics is simply that when collisional excitation is weak , collisional de - excitation is also weak : downward collisions are rare compared to spontaneous and stimulated emission , so energy put into the rotation ladder by upward collisions eventually emerges from the gas even if it is repeatedly absorbed and scattered , not only when the medium is optically thin .",
    "the last remnant of energy injected by an upward collision from the j=0 level eventually emerges in the j=1 - 0 line .",
    "calculating the brightness of a line consists merely of determining the rate at which collisions are putting energy into the line without recourse to solution of the rate equations for the level populations , the optical depth , and indeed , without detailed knowledge of the spontaneous emission rate .",
    "the ultimate point is that for any transition or species , no matter how low the ambient number density of collision partners , there is a molecular column density that will produce a given brightness . _",
    "a priori _ there is really no minimum density needed to produce a detectable line , only a required number density - column density product that we define as the molecular emission measure because ( as we show ) it is the line of sight integral of the product of two number densities .",
    "the constant of proportionality between the emission measure and line brightness depends on the collision rate and to a minor extent on the explicit molecular structure , i.e. , the rate coefficients for collisions with ambient particles and the wavelength at which a transition occurs , but not the optical depth or spontaneous emission rate .",
    "the structure of this work is as follows .",
    "in section 2 we re - derive the expression for the emergent brightness of weakly excited lines in the framework of the underlying physics of `` bulk excitation '' and we discuss collisional excitation of @xmath0 , hnc and cs by @xmath3 , he and electrons . in section 3",
    "we discuss the bulk excitation of @xmath0 , hnc and cs in the framework of the escape probability formalism underlying the lvg approximation and we show that lvg and bulk excitation calculations yield the same results when rather broad limits ( which we derive ) on the number density and line brightness are observed .",
    "section 4 gives a brief discussion of some implications and limitations and section 5 is a summary .",
    "the approach taken here is a perturbation approximation where the equilibrium condition throughout the molecular rotational energy ladder is pure radiative equilibrium with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) at 2.725 k , minutely disturbed by collisions with ambient particles at the local kinetic temperature .",
    "consider the canonical two - level atom with a transition at frequency @xmath4 , immersed in a gas of total density of h - nuclei n(h ) and kinetic temperature .",
    "the lower and upper levels are labelled _",
    "l _ and _ u _ , respectively , at energies e@xmath5 and e@xmath6 above the ground level , having statistical weights g@xmath5 and g@xmath6 .",
    "the number densties of molecules in the lower and upper levels are n@xmath5 and n@xmath6 and the levels are connected by collisions having rate coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( units of @xmath9 ) where @xmath10 = g@xmath5/g@xmath11 .",
    "the upward and downward collision rates ( units of @xmath12 ) are c@xmath13 = n(h)@xmath7 and c@xmath14 = n(h)@xmath8 ; the rate coefficients @xmath15 are normalized to reflect this definition as discussed below .",
    "the levels are also connected by the spontaneous emission rate of the upper level , a@xmath14 , and by transitions induced by the cosmic microwave background at temperature t@xmath16 = 2.725 k. the exact solution for the level populations , including the radiation field of the cosmic microwave background is @xmath17 }    { [ p_\\nu(t_{cmb})+1 + c_{ul}/a_{ul } ] } \\eqno(1)\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    for low - lying rotation transitions in the 3 mm band",
    ", h@xmath4/k = 4.3 k ( @xmath4/100 ghz ) and g@xmath5/g@xmath20 , so , at typical kinetic temperatures @xmath21 4 k it follows that @xmath22 and @xmath23 : if collisional excitation is weak , c@xmath24 a@xmath14 , collisional de - excitation is even weaker .",
    "thus in the limit of weak excitation , for the transitions considered here with relatively small values of @xmath25 , we will also have @xmath26 and the excess population in the level @xmath27 over that which would obtain in radiative equilibrium with the cosmic microwave background is @xmath28 this is obtained by differencing eq .",
    "1 evaluated with and without collisions and neglecting the collisional term in the denominator : note the change from @xmath29 in eq . 1 to @xmath30 in eq . 2 and succeeding equations . since @xmath31 ,",
    "the fractional shift of population out of the lower level , away from the radiative equilibrium established by the cosmic background , @xmath32 , is very small .",
    "@xmath37 independent of a@xmath14 .",
    "this is the origin of the approach taken here : in the limit of weak collisional excitation ( wce ) , spectral lines are merely conduits for the energy that is deposited into them and the energy is radiated at the same rate that it is injected , not at rates determined by the a - coefficients .",
    "independence from the spontaneous emission coefficient that is the main determinant of the critical density has clear implications for the limiting spatial extent of lines of different chemical species .        in the linear molecules considered here , all upward transitions out of lower - lying levels j",
    "@xmath39 j@xmath6 inject energy into the @xmath40 - @xmath41 line .",
    "thus for the 1 - 0 line , all rates @xmath42 for the 0 - 1 , 0 - 2 , etc .",
    "transitions are summed ; for the j=2 - 1 line , rates for the transitions 0 - 2 , 0 - 3 ... 0-n and 1 - 2 , 1 - 3 ... 1-n .",
    "@xmath43 where the cmb correction is included on a term - by - term basis as a modification of the collision rates @xmath44  and c@xmath6 is normalized so that the effective excitation rate coefficient into the level u , @xmath45 , is given by        @xmath49 with @xmath50 = 2.725 k. the total number density of molecules summed over all levels is just @xmath51 .",
    "some 60% of the total rotational population is in the j=0 level for @xmath0  and hnc in radiative equilibrium with the cmb , or 40% for cs .",
    "the only temperature that appears explicitly in these equations is that of the cosmic background , and the kinetic temperature dependence is entirely contained in the rate coefficients @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath54 independent of the optical depth .",
    "limiting the density in this way is necessary to justify the approximations leading to eq",
    ". 3 , but the importance of the requirement that n(h ) @xmath55 n(h)@xmath52 should not be understood merely as a limit on the excitation temperature : it is also necessary to allow energy injected into the line by collisions to escape the medium without being re - absorbed back into the thermal reservoir of the gas by collisional de - excitation . the weak collisional excitation ( wce ) approximation with a fixed proportionality between line brightness and the emission measure only applies when n(h ) @xmath55 n(h)@xmath52 .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in section 3 where a value q = 1/8 is derived by considering the relationship of the line brightness and the emission measure in the limits of high density and implicit optical depth .",
    "when n(h ) @xmath21 n(h)@xmath52 there may still be a regime where for suitably faint lines the brightness is linearly proportional to column density ( figure 3 of @xcite ) , but the ratio of brightness to emission measure decreases because progressively fewer excitations directly result in observable photons .",
    "our n(h)@xmath52 is different from the usual critical density because it is defined in terms of upward rates and because it sums over collisions that do not directly involve the level in question ( for instance @xmath56 includes 0 - 1 , 0 - 2 , 0 - 3 , etc collisions ) .",
    "the values of a@xmath57 are quite similar to the optically - thin critical densities discussed by @xcite but our n(h)@xmath52 are smaller by the factor q. values of n(h)@xmath52 are given in tables 2 and 3 for the case q = 1/8 that is discussed in section 3 .",
    "for excitation by neutral particles ( table 2 ) , n(h)@xmath52 = @xmath58 for the j=1 - 0 lines of @xmath0and hnc , and about 10 times higher for their j=2 - 1 transitions .",
    "values of n(h)@xmath52 for cs are about 5 times smaller for both lines .",
    "when electron excitation dominates for x@xmath59 ( table 3 ) the limiting densities n(h)@xmath60 are on the whole lower by a factor of order 10 .",
    "importantly , note in tables 2 and 3 that einstein a - coefficients increase much more rapidly with j@xmath6 than do the collision rates and the limiting densities n(h)@xmath52 increase with j@xmath6 , quite rapidly at the bottom of the rotation ladder . thus if the weak - excitation case applies to any transition , it is even more valid for yet higher - lying lines .",
    "@xmath62 where @xmath63 is kept inside the integral to account for variations in the kinetic temperature : the integral is defined and discussed here as the molecular emission measure .",
    "the radiative transfer of reabsorption by intervening material along the line of sight is ignored here with the understanding that the range of validity of such an assumption will be derived .",
    "the physical basis for the assumption is the limitation to densities below n(h)@xmath52 so that scattered photons are not re - absorbed back into the bath of thermal energy by downward collisions .",
    "if the relative abundance of species y , x(y ) = n(y)/n(h ) is constant , the emitted energy w@xmath64 x(y ) @xmath65 dl is heavily weighted to regions of higher density and strongly influenced by clumping .",
    "if the density n(h ) and relative abundance x(y ) are constant , w @xmath66 n(h ) n(y ) where n(y ) is the total column density of species y ( this is the analog of the lvg calculation described in section 3 ) . for any density n(h ) @xmath55 n(h)@xmath52 there is a column density n(y ) that will produce a given output w. the observability of a line is determined by the molecular emission measure , essentially the product of the density and column density .",
    "@xmath69 with n(he)/n(h ) = 0.0875 @xcite , x@xmath70 = n(e)/n(h ) and 2  = 2n(@xmath3)/n(h ) ( maintaining the usual definition of the latter ) .",
    "for the cases where all the hydrogen is in @xmath3 , n(@xmath3 ) = n(h)/2 . we ignore collisions with atomic hydrogen that is generally ineffective at exciting molecules ( and consider gas in which all the hydrogen is molecular ) but include collisions with electrons having a proportion x@xmath70 = n(e)/n(h ) . with the exception of co to which the wce limit does not apply over an interesting range of n(h ) and/or n(co ) ( see section 4.1 ) , collisions with electrons",
    "will usually dominate the excitation when co does not bear the majority of the gas phase carbon , see @xcite .",
    "references to the collision rate coefficients used here are given in table 1 and the dominance of electron excitation is apparent when collision rates are tabulated ( see appendix a ) .      for strongly - polar species having permanent dipole moments",
    "@xmath71 debye , excitation by electrons has a strongly dipole character ( @xmath72 ) and rate constants are well represented in separate closed forms for molecular ions @xcite and neutrals @xcite .",
    "however , more accurate rates for e-@xmath0  and e - hnc collisions have been calculated by @xcite and @xcite , respectively and for cs by @xcite .",
    "these have the additional virtue that they include the smaller terms with @xmath73 that are important for determining line brightness ratios over the rotation ladder in a single species ."
