    "radial velocity surveys have established that @xmath5 of solar - type stars in the solar neighborhood have periodic velocity variations with semiamplitude @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the interpretation of these velocity variations as being due to the presence of jupiter - mass planets was clinched by the observations of transits in hd 209458 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the surveys have revealed three surprising properties ; first , many of the systems have planets in extremely small ( @xmath7 au ) orbits .",
    "second , the orbits , when not subject to tidal damping , are typically highly eccentric ( @xmath8 being typical ) . finally",
    ", the host stars are often highly metal rich ( @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we explore possible explanations for the high metallicities of the stars - with - planets .",
    "two general classes of explanation have been proposed for the high metallicities seen in stars - with - planets ; high intrinsic metallicities , and accretion of metal rich material .",
    "a correlation between high intrinsic metallicity and the presence of a radial velocity planet might arise if metal rich gas disks are a prerequisite of either planet formation or planet migration .",
    "alternately , such a correlation would result from the ingestion of rocky material or metal rich gas giant planets as a result of the migration process .    here",
    "we point out that a third explanation is currently viable , namely selection effects .",
    "we discuss several possible selection effects .",
    "we point out an apparent color cutoff in the underlying samples producing the radial velocity stars .",
    "we also discuss the bias associated with the finite precision of the surveys combined with the apparent increase in number of planets with decreasing planetary mass .    in this paper",
    "we examine all three types of explanation by comparing the sample of radial velocity planet stars with a sample of dwarf stars in the solar neighborhood recently studied by @xcite .",
    "we find that the available data is consistent with the notion that a substantial amount of iron , of order six earth masses ( @xmath9 ) on average , has been accreted onto the central stars in the radial velocity systems .",
    "however , it is also possible , although in our judgment less likely , that the trends in metallicity we see are due to the selection effects mentioned above .",
    "the explanation based on high intrinsic metallicity is inconsistent with the observation that several low stellar mass radial velocity systems have substantially subsolar metallicities ; neither does it explain the variations in metallicity as a function of stellar mass that we find .",
    "however , there is evidence that _ some _ radial velocity systems are intrinsically metal rich ; hd 38529 sits in the hertzsprung gap , indicating that it currently has a very deep convection zone , yet it has a high metallicity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ data ]",
    "we examine the @xmath10 colors as a function of stellar mass , and the distribution of metallicity as a function of stellar mass and age for both stars - with - planets and the murray et al . sample .",
    "we show that the radial velocity sample has @xmath11 , but in  [ selection ] we argue that neither this nor the difficulty of achieving high precision radial velocities for metal poor or blue stars completely explains the metallicity trends we find . neither does the decreasing sensitivity of radial velocity surveys with increasing stellar mass ( with the subsequent weakening of the absorption lines ) , combined with the reduced frequency of more massive planets , appear to explain the sharp increase in with increasing stellar mass . in  [ pollution ] we use monte carlo models of stellar pollution to estimate the amount of accreted iron needed to reproduce the observed metallicity trends , assuming that they are not due to selection effects . in  [ discussion ] we compare our results with recent results by other authors , and we summarize our conclusions in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we find the masses and ages of the known planet - bearing stars using their hipparcos parallaxes , combined with their @xmath12 magnitudes , their effective temperatures @xmath13 if available ( or @xmath10 colors when @xmath13 is not known ) , and their metallicities . for the bulk of the stars with planets we use spectroscopically determined values of the metallicity taken from the literature @xcite , but in the case of a few of the more recently discovered systems we use color - based metallicities , primarily from the coravel web site ( http://obswww.unige.ch/  udry / planet / planet.html ) .",
    "we fit to the grid of stellar models described in @xcite , to which we refer the interested reader for further details .    in finding the ages and masses of the stars",
    "we have used models which have uniform compositions . in the light of the findings presented below",
    ", such models are only good as a lowest order approximation .",
    "we have modified chaboyer s stellar evolution code to handle polluted models , but defer discussion of the results to later publications .",
    "we compare the sample of stars - with - planets to the sample of 466 main sequence stars , and to a sample of 19 slightly evolved ( or `` hertzsprung gap '' ) stars described in @xcite . the color - magnitude diagram for both samples",
    "is shown in figure [ fig_hr ] .",
    "the hertzsprung gap stars are located in the sparsely sampled region between the main sequence ( running from the lower right to the upper left hand corner of the plot ) and the giants ( in the uppr right hand corner ) ; the gap stars are just coming off the main sequence , and have convection zones ten times more massive than the surface mixing layer the star possessed while on the main sequence ( either convectively or rotationally mixed ) .",
    "they are useful as a control , since their deep convection zones tend to minimize the effect of any accretion of iron rich material that may have occurred while the star was on the main sequence .",
    "we note that there are two giants stars in the current sample of stars - with - planets .",
    "one of these , hd 177830 , has a radius of about @xmath14 according to our models .",
    "however , its planet orbits at @xmath15 au , still at many tens of stellar radii . direct comparison between the metallicities of dwarfs and giants are problematic , so the giant stars are not shown in any of the following plots .",
    "figure [ fig_b_minus_v ] shows the b - v color as a function of stellar mass for both samples .",
    "the lower panel is the data for the murray et al .",
    "stars , the upper for stars with planets ; in both panels the solid squares are stars on the main sequence , while the open triangles are stars in the hertzsprung gap .",
    "comparing the two panels shows that the radial velocity surveys have a selection effect : with two exceptions all the stars with planets have @xmath11 ( the horizontal solid line in the figure ) .",
    "in contrast , the murray et al .",
    "stars less massive than @xmath16 range down to @xmath17 .    at fixed stellar mass ,",
    "metal poor stars have lower values of @xmath10 than metal rich stars of the same age .",
    "alternately , at fixed @xmath10 , increasing stellar mass implies increasing metallicity .",
    "thus the current radial velocity surveys are biased against low metallicity stars , and a plot of versus mass based on such a selection criterion will have a lower limit corresponding to increasing with increasing mass could be a real effect , as opposed to a selection effect",
    ". however , we note below that the sample from which the planet bearing stars found by mayor and co - workers were drawn appears to have @xmath18 .",
    "we note however that for stars less massive than @xmath19 none of the stars in the murray et al .",
    "sample have @xmath20 , so for stars less massive than this the color cutoff introduces no bias .",
    "furthermore , we show below that applying the @xmath10 cutoff to the murray et al .",
    "sample introduces only a slight change in an vs mass plot , a change not large enough to explain the difference between the murray et al .",
    "sample and the sample of stars with planets .",
    "figure [ fig_histogram ] shows the metallicity histograms of the murray et al .",
    "sample and the stars with planets .",
    "the unshaded histogram drawn with the heavy solid line is for all the stars in the murray et al .",
    "sample , while the histogram drawn with the dotted line includes only stars in that sample with @xmath11 ; the difference is negligible .",
    "it is clear that the stars - with - planets sample is metal rich relative to the other two samples , supporting the results of earlier workers ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is also clear that this difference is not due to the color selection criterion .",
    "a histogram of those stars - with - planets having @xmath21 has a lower average metallicity , but so does the analogous histogram for the murray et al .",
    "sample ; the result is that there is still a significant difference between the two samples . since stars with @xmath22",
    "do not appear to be as blue as @xmath23 , this demonstrates again that the difference in between the two samples is not due to the apparent @xmath10 selection .",
    "the excess metallicity of the stars with planets is even more striking when the metallicity is plotted as a function of stellar mass , as in figure [ fig_fe_mass ] ( see also laughlin 2000 ) .",
    "the lower panel shows the metallicity of the stars from murray et al .",
    "having @xmath11 .",
    "the upper panel shows the metallicity of the stars with planets ( excluding two giants ) . from this figure",
    "it is clear that , while low mass stars - with - planets cover the same range of metallicities as the murray et al .",
    "sample , the high mass stars - with - planets are all metal rich .    in the upper panel of figure [ fig_fe_mass ]",
    "we have depicted those stars having planets with semimajor axes @xmath24 au by open squares .",
    "the filled squares denote those stars with hot jupiters , having @xmath25 au . in figure",
    "[ fig_fe_mass_cold]a we show all stars having planets with @xmath26 au .",
    "it demonstrates that the metallicity trends seen in the stars - with - planets sample ( figure [ fig_fe_mass ] ) are not strong functions of the semimajor axis of the planets .",
    "we discuss the significance of this result in  [ discussion ] .",
    "the solid line in both panels shows the boundary between chaboyer s stellar models with @xmath11 ( up and to the left of the line ) and those with @xmath20 below and to the right ) .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath10 depend on the age of the model ; both pre - main sequence and evolved stars are redder than stars of the same mass and metallicity on the main sequence . in plotting the solid line we have taken models on the main sequence at or near the age at which @xmath10 is minimized .",
    "if all the stars in both samples were near the zero age main sequence , essentially all would be above and to the left of this solid line ( assuming our colors are good matches to those of real stars ) .",
    "this is true for the stars - with - planets sample , but not for the murray et al . sample .",
    "our models indicate that the latter sample has many stars which are evolving off the main sequence , and which are currently redder than @xmath23 even though younger stars with their mass and metallicity would have @xmath20 .",
    "the location of the hertzsprung gap stars ( plotted as open triangles ) is consistent with this interpretation .",
    "the width of the main sequence in figure [ fig_hr ] near the upper end ( @xmath27 ) is also consistent with this picture .",
    "if the trend of increasing with increasing mass were due to the ( apparent ) color selection of the radial velocity surveys , we would expect that the bulk of the metallicities of the parent stars would be above and to the left of this solid line , with the possibility that some slightly evolved stars would be below and to the right , as is seen in the murray et al . sample .",
    "in fact all the stars with planets _ are _ above the @xmath23 line ; even for stars with mass below @xmath28 , when the color selection should not matter ( according to figure [ fig_b_minus_v ] ) the stars - with - planets are all well above the line .",
    "we conclude that the mass - metallicity trend seen at the high mass end of the stars - with - planets sample is not due entirely to the @xmath10 cutoff ; as noted above , in the case of stars with @xmath29 , the color cutoff has no effect .",
    "binning the data by mass ( figure [ fig_fe_mass_binned ] ) again shows that the metallicity properties of the murray et al .",
    "sample differ from those of the stars with planets .",
    "the data points in this figure show the average in mass bins @xmath30 wide , along with the associated standard errors ( variance divided by the square root of the number of star less one ) .",
    "the open squares correspond to the murray et al .",
    "sample , the filled squares to a subset of that sample with @xmath11 .",
    "as noted above , the color selection criterion does not effect the metallicity distribution for stars below @xmath19 ; even for more massive stars , the differences between the average with and without applying the color cutoff , while noticeable , are much smaller than the differences between the murray et al .",
    "sample and the stars with planets sample ( filled triangles ) .",
    "we note that the average metallicity of the stars with planets rises much more rapidly with increasing mass than either the hertzsprung gap or the main sequence stars without planets .",
    "this strongly suggests that the stars with planets have accreted iron rich material after they reached the main sequence .",
    "we quantify this below .",
    "it is also instructive to plot metallicity as a function of stellar age , since younger stars are expected to be metal rich when compared to older stars .",
    "as seen in the lower panel of figure [ fig_fe_age_binned ] , there is a correlation between stellar age and metallicity in the murray et al . sample",
    "; younger stars are , on average , more metal rich than older stars . the average value of rises steadily from @xmath31 at 10 gyrs to @xmath32 at the present .",
    "compared to this rather regular rise , the age - metallicity distribution of the stars - with - planets sample ( the upper panel ) is odd .",
    "it jumps rather abruptly from @xmath33 ( or solar ) at @xmath34 gyrs to @xmath35 for stars of all ages less than @xmath36gyrs .",
    "we must account for the difference in @xmath10 between the two samples to make a fair comparison ; we do so by plotting only those stars with @xmath11 and mass less than @xmath37 as open squares in the bottom panel .",
    "there is a slight difference , but the result is nothing like the data in the upper panel .      the sample of stars - with - planets was apparently drawn from a stellar sample with a selection criterion of @xmath2 .",
    "this by itself can not explain the the rapid rise of metallicity with stellar mass , as demonstrated by figures [ fig_fe_mass ] and [ fig_fe_mass_binned ] .    however , there is another possible selection effect .",
    "the radial velocity technique relies on a cross - correlation between a known spectrum ( usually provided by an iodine cell placed in the beam ) and the stellar spectrum .",
    "stars that are more massive and hence hotter have weaker lines than less massive stars ; similarly metal poor stars have weaker lines than metal rich stars .",
    "thus massive metal poor stars will have weak , sparse spectra , and achieving high precision radial velocities for such stars is likely to be problematic .",
    "this line of argument suggests that part of the metallicity trend we see might be due to the inability of radial velocity surveys to identify planets around massive metal poor stars . to evaluate this",
    "properly one could examine the radial velocity errors as a function of stellar mass and metallicity , or as a function of @xmath10 , since increasing mass and decreasing metallicity both tend to reduce @xmath10 .",
    "we urge observers to do so .    lacking this information , we instead examine the distribution of the semiamplitude @xmath38 with stellar mass ; see figure [ fig_k_mass ] .",
    "there does appear to be a mass - dependent lower envelope ; for stars more massive than @xmath39 , the minimum @xmath38 increases with increasing stellar mass .",
    "we also note that for stars less massive than the sun , the minimum @xmath38 increases with _ decreasing _ stellar mass . both of these trends may be due simply to the small numbers involved ; most stars with planets have very nearly solar masses , with only a few stars more massive than @xmath40 or less massive than @xmath41 .",
    "however , it is possible that the apparent trends are due to a @xmath38 selection effect . here",
    "we will assume that it is , and show that such a selection does not appear to explain the rapid rise in with stellar mass .",
    "to do so we plot versus stellar mass , but only for those systems having @xmath42 ( see figure [ fig_fe_mass_cold]b ) , on the assumption that the current surveys are reasonably complete for @xmath38 this large .",
    "the trend with stellar mass is unchanged .",
    "there is a third possible selection effect related to the masses of the parent stars .",
    "the distribution of planet masses appears to indicate that there are more low mass planets than high mass planets .",
    "a power law provides a rough fit , @xmath43 , with @xmath44 of order 1 .",
    "suppose that the current radial velocity surveys can detect @xmath45 for all stars up to @xmath46 .",
    "a star of @xmath46 must have a planet twice as massive as a star of @xmath47 in order to produce a wobble of amplitude @xmath48 .",
    "the more massive star is then only @xmath49 as likely to have such a planet , assuming stars of different masses have the same chance of having a planet of a fixed mass .",
    "examining equal numbers of high and low mass stars would then yield more planets around low mass stars .",
    "if the sample is not complete near @xmath48 , the high mass stars would then tend to be more metal rich than the low mass stars , since the low metallicity high mass stars with low @xmath38 would be harder to detect .",
    "we believe however , that the current samples are reasonably complete for @xmath42 , so this seems unlikely to explain the strong trend seen in the versus stellar mass plot .",
    "we tentatively conclude that the trend of increasing with increasing stellar mass is a real physical effect .",
    "the odd distribution of with stellar age for the stars - with - planets sample is also hard to explain as the result of a selection effect . assuming that stars - with - planets only form in high metallicity clouds also fails to explain the age - metallicity relation , since it would predict uniformly high metallicities . in the next section we present monte carlo models of polluted stellar populations and compare them to the data .",
    "to model the pollution we follow murray et al .",
    "the outer layers of the star are assumed to be well mixed down to a depth which depends on the mass and bulk metallicity of the star . for stars less massive than @xmath40",
    ", the mass of this mixed layer is assumed to be given by the mass of the surface convection zone . for more massive stars",
    "murray et al .",
    "used the observed lithium abundances of open clusters to infer the mass of the surface mixing layer .",
    "briefly , the abundance of lithium as a function of stellar mass ( or effective temperature ) shows a dramatic dip around @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the dip is believed to be due to the thermonuclear destruction of lithium at depths where the temperature exceeds @xmath51k .",
    "this strongly suggests that surface material is mixed down into the star well below the bottom of the convection zone , which is very thin in a @xmath50 star .",
    "murray et al .",
    "describe a crude empirical model for the depth of this surface mixing layer as a function of stellar mass and composition ; we use that model in this section .    the stars in the murray et al .",
    "sample show a distinct jump in around @xmath16 , just above the lithium dip ( the open squares in figure [ fig_fe_mass_binned ] ) .",
    "they argue that the stars in their sample , the bulk of which are not known to have jupiter - mass planets , have accreted iron rich material after having reached the main sequence . using their model for the depth of the mixing layer , they compare monte carlo simulations of polluted stellar populations to the observed mass - metallicity distribution to infer that , on average , the stars in their sample have accreted @xmath52 of iron .",
    "( we reproduce the result in figure [ fig_theory ] . )",
    "the hertzsprung gap stars afford a test of this conclusion .",
    "if most stars are polluted , then when they evolve and develop or deepen surface convection zones , their metal rich surface layers will be mixed with the relatively metal poor inner layers , reducing the surface iron abundance . as can be seen from figure [ fig_theory ] ,",
    "the hertzsprung gap stars ( shown as open triangles ) are metal poor compared to unevolved stars of the same mass .",
    "figure [ fig_theory ] also shows that a polluted model can fit all three data sets ( including the stars - with - planets sample ) with only one free parameter , the average mass of accreted material .",
    "the unpolluted model is shown as the dotted line , which passes through the error bars associated with the hertzsprung gap stars . as mentioned above , the solid line , which is a best fit model for the unevolved stars in the murray et al .",
    "sample , corresponds to an average mass of accreted iron of @xmath53 .",
    "the dashed line running through the stars - with - planets data corresponds to a model with an average of @xmath3 of accreted iron .",
    "this plot makes a clear prediction ; stars above @xmath54 that have short to moderate period jupiter - mass planets will have very high metallicities .",
    "the plot suggests of order @xmath55 .",
    "we caution that this prediction assumes that our unpolluted models are good representations of stars that have surface layers much more metal rich than their interiors ( by about @xmath56 dex ) .",
    "this assumption must be checked using polluted models .",
    "nevertheless , we feel that stars with short period jupiters having masses larger than @xmath54 will have metallicities substantially above @xmath57 dex .",
    "the same monte carlo models yield the histogram of polluted stars shown in figure [ fig_theory_histogram ] .",
    "the model is shown by the open histogram , on which is superimposed the histogram of stars - with - planets . in both samples",
    "we include only stars less massive than @xmath37 , since there are only two stars in the stars - with - planets sample more massive than this value .",
    "the agreement is excellent .    finally ,",
    "the monte carlo models give the run of average with age .",
    "the solid lines in figure [ fig_fe_age_binned ] give the results .",
    "we see that the model with @xmath53 of added iron gives a good fit to the murray et al .",
    "sample , while the model with @xmath3 of added iron fits the stars - with - planets data .",
    "we stress that the underlying ( unpolluted ) variation of metallicity with stellar age is the same in both monte carlo models .",
    "thus pollution can explain the variation of with mass , and the variation of with stellar age , in both samples .",
    "this result bolsters our confidence that the stars - with - planet sample has suffered a substantial amount of pollution .",
    "four recent papers @xcite have presented figures similar to the upper panel of our figure [ fig_fe_mass ] .",
    "laughlin also shows data for photometrically determined as a function of stellar mass , much like the bottom panel of figure [ fig_fe_mass ] .",
    "both laughlin and gonzalez et al .",
    "conclude that the data are consistent with pollution of the outer envelopes of the stars - with - planets by iron rich material , _ after the stars have reached the main sequence_.    in contrast , both santos et al .",
    "papers conclude that the data `` support the idea that a star needs to be formed out of a metal rich cloud to form giant planets '' .",
    "they argue that their results rule out pollution .    in view of the fact that there are now seven stars - with - planets having @xmath58 , and that four of these have @xmath59 , the statement that a star needs to be born in a metal rich cloud to form giant planets seems unwarranted .    from figure [ fig_fe_mass ]",
    "we see that the distribution of metallicity for stars with @xmath60 is nearly the same for stars - with - planets and stars without ( known ) planets . from figure",
    "[ fig_fe_mass_binned ] we see that the average metallicity rises with mass for both classes of stars , although it rises much more rapidly for stars - with - planets .",
    "in contrast , it rises only very slowly for hertzsprung gap stars .",
    "murray et al . argue that the rise seen in their sample arises partly from pollution , and partly from the fact that less massive stars tend to be older than more massive stars ( the ` age - mass relationship ' ) , and older stars tend to be metal poor .",
    "we note that the age - mass relationship we find for the stars - with - planets sample is very similar to that of the murray et al .",
    "sample , yet the versus stellar mass relation for the stars - with - planets sample rises much more rapidly than that of the murray et al . sample .",
    "we have shown above that accretion of @xmath3 of iron will produce such a rise . in the absence of a known selection effect capable of producing such a dramatic trend , this suggests that the stars - with - planets have accreted substantial amounts of iron rich material .",
    "@xcite also show , in their figure 4 , a histogram of stars - with - planets together with sample in which they added @xmath61 of iron to their sample of 43 stars with low limits on @xmath38 ( that is , stars which do nt have jupiter - mass planets in short to moderate period orbits ) .",
    "they restricted their stars to have mass less than @xmath40 .",
    "they find that there are too many polluted stars at high values of compared to the stars - with - planets sample , and that the steep fall at the high metallicity end of the distribution is not reproduced .",
    "they conclude that that a simple pollution model can not explain the observations .",
    "our results , illustrated in figures [ fig_theory_histogram ] and [ fig_theory ] , contradict with this statement .",
    "the main differences appear to be that santos et al .",
    "added @xmath61 of iron , about three times the amount added in our best fit model , and that they took a smaller mass ( equal to the mass of the convection zone ) for the surface mixing layer of even their most massive stars .",
    "since the iron content of the convection zone of their @xmath62 star of solar metallicity is about @xmath63 , they find stars with approaching unity when they add @xmath61 of iron .",
    "our models use a slightly more massive surface mixing layer for stars above @xmath40 ( taken from an empirical fit to lithium abundance data , see murray et al .",
    "more importantly , we add less iron , so we do not find many stars with metallicities above @xmath55 dex .",
    "santos et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also plot versus mass ( their figure 5 ) for their sample of planet - less dwarfs .",
    "the latter sample shows a lower envelope of increasing with increasing mass , which tracks the lower envelope of the stars - with - planets .",
    "in contrast , as can be seen in our figure [ fig_fe_mass ] , while we see a lower envelope that increases with increasing mass in our sample , it has a much lower value of at any given stellar mass",
    ". clearly their sample of dwarfs differs from the one we employ .",
    "in fact a quick check shows that all but two stars in the @xcite planet - less sample satisfy @xmath64 .",
    "the bluest star has @xmath65 ; it appears as an outlier in the lower right hand corner of their figure 5 .",
    "had they allowed for planet - less stars as blue as @xmath66 ( as found in the stars - with - planets sample , and applied to the stars in the murray et al . sample as plotted in figure ( [ fig_fe_mass ] ) they would have seen many planet - less stars at every mass having much lower than the stars - with - planets sample .",
    "the peculiar behavior of with stellar age for the stars - with - planets sample is a second indication that pollution has occurred in these stars . restricting @xmath10 to be larger than @xmath66 ( as shown by the open squares in the bottom panel of figure [ fig_fe_age_binned ] ) or even @xmath67 in the murray et al .",
    "sample does not produce the very sharp rise at ages around 10 gyrs . however , the polluted model that fits the versus mass data naturally produces a good fit to the versus stellar age data .",
    "as pointed out in murray et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , slightly evolved ( or hertzsprung gap ) stars offer a possible test of the pollution scenario ; they should have , on average , lower metallicities if most stars are polluted .",
    "our fits to evolutionary tracks show that only one star in the current stars - with - planets sample , hd 38529 , is such a star ; this star can be seen in the hertzsprung gap in figure ( [ fig_hr ] ) .",
    "hd 38529 has a rather high @xmath68 .",
    "we conclude that at least some of the high metallicities seen in this sample are likely to be due to a high primordial metallicity .",
    "we stress however , that high primordial metallicities are not required to produce radial velocity planets , nor will they produce the steep trend in seen in the low mass stars . more stars - with - planets will be discovered in the hertzsprung gap as the radial velocity surveys proceed , which will allow an unbiased test of the pollution scenario .",
    "laughlin and adams ( 1997 ) showed that accretion of jupiter - mass planets pushed into their parent stars during the lifetime of the protoplanetary disk would produce little or no pollution of low mass stars .",
    "however , lin ( 1997 ) has speculated that jupiter - mass bodies may be accreted after the gas disk has dissipated .",
    "we argue that such a scenario is unlikely to explain the difference between the stars - with - planets sample and the murray et al .",
    "sample , assuming the steep increase in in the former is not a selection effect .",
    "figure [ fig_fe_mass_cold ] demonstrates that the elevated metallicities seen in the stars - with - planets does not require the presence of a very short period jupiter ; 9 of the systems with @xmath69 exhibit innermost planets having semimajor axes exceeding 1 au , and several have @xmath70au .",
    "hd 27442 is a solar mass star ( @xmath71 ) with a planet of mass @xmath72 at @xmath73 au on a nearly circular orbit ; the star has @xmath74 .",
    "if this star ingested a jupiter mass planet , it did so with out the aid of the remaining planet .",
    "figure [ fig_fe_mass ] shows that there is a distinct shortage of low metallicity stars - with - planets having masses greater than about @xmath75 .",
    "if this is due to pollution , then essentially every star - with - planet is polluted ; if a significant fraction were not polluted , then we would see some low but slightly evolved high mass stars - with - planets , as well as unevolved low mass stars - with - planets closer to the @xmath10 cutoff .",
    "our models show that the average amount of accreted iron in the stars - with - planets sample is of order @xmath9 . in contrast , no more than about @xmath76 of the the stars in the murray et al .",
    "sample could have accreted that much material , or the distribution of would be double peaked , contradicting the observations .    the tight correlation between the presence of a radial velocity planet and the accretion of several earth masses of iron is difficult to explain as the result of the accretion of a jupiter - mass body .",
    "it requires that most or all stars with radial velocity planets accrete jupiter - mass bodies ( after @xmath77 myrs ) independent of the semimajor axis of the remaining planet(s ) , while less than @xmath78 of stars lacking radial velocity planets do so .",
    "( note that the rather weak metallicity mass trend found by murray et al .",
    "shows that no more than @xmath79 of stars lacking radial velocity planets could have accreted a jupiter - mass planet with the metallicity of jupiter . )",
    "it is difficult to believe that the presence of a jupiter - mass planet at @xmath80 au , as seen in several systems , can ensure the accretion of a second jupiter - mass planet .",
    "we note that our own jupiter , at @xmath81 au , almost certainly did not cause the accretion of any jupiter - mass objects onto our sun 20 myrs after it formed .    on the other hand jupiter did cause the accretion of a substantial mass of asteroids onto the sun , of order @xmath82 .",
    "it is likely that jupiter migrated inward @xmath83 au during the ejection of interplanetary material , but the presence of the inner asteroid belt , as well as the regular orbits of both jupiter and saturn , suggest that jupiter did not migrate several au .",
    "the small orbits of the currently known extrasolar planets are consistent with the notion that they migrated inward several au .",
    "if there was a massive planetesimal disk inside the original location of these planets , a substantial fraction , of order @xmath84 , of the material in the disk would have been dropped on the star ( @xcite ) as a result of resonant interactions between the planet and the planetesimals .",
    "if the migration proceeds to very small semimajor axes ( @xmath85 au ) a second process becomes efficient , namely scattering of planetesimals by the planet onto the star .",
    "this will add another @xmath86 of the disk mass onto the star @xcite .",
    "if the planetesimal disk is _ responsible _ for the inward migration ( @xcite ) , then the amount of accreted material will be larger for more massive planets .",
    "this effect should be most dramatic in more massive stars , since they have less massive surface mixing regions .",
    "a plot of versus @xmath87 , for stars more massive than @xmath47 ( figure [ fig_msini ] ) does hint at such a trend of increasing metallicity with increasing mass , but the trend is significant only at the two - sigma level . increasing the size of the stars - with - planets sample will allow this question to be answered more definitively .",
    "another possible signature of planetesimal accretion is the relative enhancement of volatile ( e.g. , c , n ) versus refractory ( fe , ni ) elements .",
    "asteroids and terrestrial planets are depleted in noble gases ; terrestrial planets ( but not most asteroids ) are also strongly depleted in elements such as carbon , presumably because the formed from material that condensed at high temperature . by contrast ,",
    "jupiter and the other giant planets in our solar system are carbon rich ( they are presumably also iron rich , but there is no direct evidence ) .",
    "thus , accreting material that condensed very close to the star would enhance the iron abundance , but not the carbon abundance .",
    "accreting rocky material that formed farther from the star would enhance both carbon and iron , as would the accretion of jupiter .",
    "we conclude that stars having radial velocity planets in orbits of order @xmath57 au or smaller are likely , in the planetesimal accretion scenario , to have accreted material that is rich in refractories such as iron and magnesium , but volatile poor , since the planetesimals in such small orbits condense from the protoplanetary disk at high temperature .",
    "there is some evidence indicating that this is the case ( @xcite ) .",
    "previous work has shown that stars possessing radial velocity planets appear , on average , to be metal rich compared to field stars of the same mass and age ( @xcite ) .",
    "we confirm this result .",
    "our work has emphasized that part of this difference is due to a color selection effect : the stars - with - planets appear to be drawn from a sample chosen to have @xmath11 ( or @xmath88 in the case of the sample presented in santos et al .",
    "2001 ) . as a result ,",
    "the high mass stars included in the present surveys _ have _ to have high metallicity , skewing the distribution of in the resulting sample of stars - with - planets .",
    "however , we have shown this color cutoff does not affect stars with @xmath21 ; even for the subset of stars less massive than this , the stars - with - planets still have higher average metallicity than our control sample . applying the same @xmath10 cutoff to the control sample",
    "does in fact increase the average of the high mass stars , but not by enough to explain the difference between the two samples .",
    "we conclude that the high metallicity of the stars - with - planet sample is not due to the color selection effect . nor is the steep rise in as a function of stellar mass in the range @xmath89 , or the lack of a trend in as a function of stellar age , explained by the color selection effect .",
    "our monte carlo simulations of pollution show that all three observations ( high average , rapid increase in with stellar mass , and the lack of a trend in with age ) can be produced by the addition of @xmath90 of iron to those stars which have radial velocity planets .",
    "laughlin ( 2000 ) has pointed out that measurements of in those stars - with - planets having stellar companions can be used to test the pollution hypothesis .",
    "we point out another test , examining stars - with - planets in the hertzsprung gap .",
    "the one star in the current sample that resides in the gap is metal rich , suggesting that its bulk metallicity is high ; no pollution is required for this object , although it might have had an even higher ( apparent ) metallicity while on the main sequence .",
    "a third test will be provided by the discovery of planets around stars more massive than @xmath91 ; if pollution is occurring on the scale suggested here these stars should be very metal rich .",
    "further theoretical work is needed to determine exactly how metal rich they should be .",
    "we argued that any accreted iron is unlikely to have been added in the form of a gas giant planet , and suggested that trends in the abundances of volatile versus refractory elements can be used to distinguish between gas giant accretion , and planetesimal accretion ( @xcite ) . a second trend , namely higher in systems with more massive planets , as hinted at in figure [ fig_msini ] ,",
    "could also be used to distinguish between planetesimal accretion and gas giant accretion . establishing",
    "the reality of either trend would strongly suggest that pollution plays a significant role in such systems .",
    "support for this work was provided by nserc of canada , by nasa , and by a nsf career grant to brian chaboyer .",
    "dr chaboyer is a cottrell scholar of the research corporation .",
    "this research made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france ."
