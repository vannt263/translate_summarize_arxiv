    "extensive research and development have been done recently on quantum information technologies , and teleportation is known to provide important tools for quantum communication and information processing .",
    "its protocol was originally proposed by using a two - dimensional system , qubit , such as the polarization of light @xcite .",
    "other protocols were also considered to teleport the quadrature phase components @xcite and the multi - dimensional states such as photon number states @xcite . among these media for quantum teleportation , the photon number fock space may be considered more promising in the view point that it provides higher dimensional states such as qutrits to carry more quantum information than qubits .    in order to perform faithfully the number state teleportation in some finite dimensional subspace of fock space ,",
    "maximally entangled einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) resource is required .",
    "then , we have proposed recently a practical method to generate such epr states @xcite .",
    "that is , more entangled states are obtained from a pair of squeezed vacuum states via swapping by performing the number - phase bell measurement . in particular , the resultant states are maximally entangled by adjusting the two squeezing parameters to the same value .",
    "this may be viewed as entanglement concentration @xcite .",
    "the number state teleportation can be performed by using these number - phase bell states .",
    "it is noticed in this teleportation that some manipulations are made such as shift and truncation of photon number states and also scaling of amplitudes by the ratio of two squeezing parameters . in this way",
    ", teleportation protocols may be considered at the same time as those to manipulate input states by projectictive measurements with epr resources ( irrespective of teleportation fidelity ) .",
    "in fact , quantum scissors protocol is investigated for number state truncation by projective measurement @xcite .",
    "therefore , we may expect that various manipulations of number states are implemented via teleportation without knowing the input states .",
    "this method can also be used to transfer to the output states the quantum information encoded in the epr resources .    in this article , we examine various manipulations of number states based on teleportation using projective measurement of bell state with certain number sum . for this purpose ,",
    "epr resources with number difference 0 and those with number sum @xmath0 are found to be useful .",
    "these essential ingredients for teleportation , epr resources and projective measurements , will be realized experimentally with linear optics , specifically beam splitters , phase shifters and zero - one - photon detectors . squeezed vacuum states",
    "are used as primary entanglement resource , while single - photon sources are not required .",
    "this may be an interesting point in the present scheme .    in sec .",

    "[ sec : summary ] is devoted to summary .",
    "we begin with examining the epr resource which may be shared by bob and alice for number state teleportation .",
    "we present in the following two kinds of epr resources with certain number difference and sum , respectively , and consider their characteristic properties .",
    "an epr state with number difference 0 is given generally with amplitude distribution @xmath1 by @xmath2 among such states , squeezed vacuum states generated by parametric down conversion may be primarily interesting .",
    "they are used widely as entanglement resource in various experiments utilizing photons .",
    "a two - mode squeezed vacuum state is described as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the squeezing parameter .",
    "this non - uniform number distribution with @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ svs ] ) is attributed to the fact that the fock space is infinite dimensional while the energy should be finite for the physical states .",
    "hence , the squeezed vacuum states are not maximally entangled .",
    "we may also use a photon - subtracted state which is generated from a squeezed vacuum state @xcite : @xmath6 epr states with number difference @xmath7 may further be used , with which the photon number shift is induced via teleportation .",
    "they are , however , not considered in the following , since the number shift of @xmath8 is also realized by taking number sum @xmath0 epr states and number sum @xmath9 measurement , as seen in sec .",

    "some general methods to obtain @xmath0-photon entangled states have been investigated by utilizing linear optical devices @xcite .",
    "we adopt the measurement resulting in projection to certain bell state with number sum @xmath9 , @xmath41 where @xmath9 may or may not be equal to @xmath0 of the epr resource @xmath42 . actually , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f - bell ] , the number sum measurement for the bell state @xmath43 may be performed with some probability by setting suitably linear optical elements , i.e. , beam splitters , phase shifters and zero - one - photon detectors .",

    "since the total number of photons is conserved through this linear optical set , the number sum @xmath9 is measured as the total count of photon detections .",
    "the aim of the present analysis is to provide various manipulations of photon number states with linear optics , and hence we assume for clarity that the zero - one - photon detectors can ideally discriminate the photon numbers @xmath44 = 0 , 1 and more .",
    "the estimate of efficiency in actual experiments with imperfect detectors will be presented elsewhere specifically for the manipulations of qubits and qutrits .",
    "the single - photon detection is essential and quite challenging for realizing quantum communication and processing with photon number states .",
    "it is indeed encouraging that some significant developments and new proposals have been made for single - photon detection to achieve the quantum efficiency close to unity @xcite .",

    "( [ bell+ ] ) will be done as follows by attaching some number of _ ancilla _ modes which are initially in the vacuum states @xmath45 . by suitably setting the optical elements and choosing their parameters ,",
    "the desired bell state may be transformed as @xmath46 with nonzero coefficient @xmath47 , while any orthogonal state @xmath48 does not contain the first component , where  @xmath49 \" in the second line represents the output states with other photon number distributions .",
    "then , by registering one photon in the output ports @xmath50 to @xmath51 and no photon in the others , we can measure the bell state @xmath43 conditionally with success probability @xmath52    it should be mentioned that the number sum is not enough to specify the bell state in eq .",
    "( [ bell+ ] ) with the amplitude distribution @xmath53 .",

    "generally , it should be noted that any unitary transformation of @xmath85 among @xmath0 photon modes can be realized in this way @xcite .",
    "the number - phase bell measurement can be done for the cases of @xmath86 by using a 50/50 beam splitter with @xmath87 as shown in fig .",
