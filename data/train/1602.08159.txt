    "quantum physics , which is the fundamental framework of physics , exhibits rich dynamics , sufficient to explain natural phenomena in microscopic worlds . as feynman pointed out  @xcite , the simulation of quantum systems on classical computers is extremely challenging because of the high complexity of these systems .",
    "instead , they should be simulated by using a machine of which the operation is based on the laws of quantum physics .    motivated by the recent rapid experimental progress in controlling complex quantum systems , non - conventional information processing utilising quantum physics has been explored in the field of quantum information science  @xcite .",
    "for example , certain mathematical problems , such as integer factorisation , which are believed to be intractable on a classical computer , are known to be efficiently solvable by a sophisticatedly synthesized quantum algorithm  @xcite . therefore",
    ", considerable experimental effort has been devoted to realising full - fledged universal quantum computers  @xcite . on the other hand , quantum simulators",
    "are thought to be much easier to implement than a full - fledged universal quantum computer . in this",
    "regard , existing quantum simulators have already shed new light on the physics of complex many - body quantum systems  @xcite , and a restricted class of quantum dynamics , known as adiabatic dynamics , has also been applied to combinatorial optimisation problems  @xcite . however , complex real - time quantum dynamics , which is one of the most difficult tasks for classical computers to simulate  @xcite and has great potential to perform nontrivial information processing , is now waiting to be harnessed as a resource for more general purpose information processing . specifically , the recent rapid progress in sensing and internet technologies has resulted in an increasing demand for fast intelligent big data analysis with low energy consumption . this has motivated us to develop brain - inspired information processing devices of a non - von neumann type , on which machine learning tasks are able to run natively  @xcite .    here",
    "we propose a novel framework to exploit the complexity of real - time quantum dynamics in ensemble quantum systems for nonlinear and temporal learning problems .",
    "these problems include a variety of real - world tasks such as time - dependent signal processing , speech recognition , natural language processing , sequential motor control of robots , and stock market predictions .",
    "our approach is based on a machine learning technique inspired by the way the brain processes information , so - called _ reservoir computing _  @xcite .",
    "in particular , this framework focuses on real - time computing with time - varying input that requires the use of memory , unlike feedforward neural networks . in this framework ,",
    "the low - dimensional input is projected to a high - dimensional dynamical system , which is typically referred to as a _ reservoir _ , generating transient dynamics that facilitates the separation of input states @xcite . if the dynamics of the reservoir involve both adequate memory and nonlinearity @xcite , emulating nonlinear dynamical systems only requires adding a linear and static readout from the high - dimensional state space of the reservoir .",
    "a number of different implementations of reservoirs have been proposed , such as abstract dynamical systems for echo state networks ( esns ) @xcite or models of neurons for liquid state machines @xcite .",
    "the implementations are not limited to programs running on the pc but also include physical systems , such as the surface of water in a laminar state @xcite , analogue circuits and optoelectronic systems @xcite , and neuromorphic chips @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been reported that the mechanical bodies of soft and compliant robots have also been successfully used as a reservoir @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the refinements required by learning algorithms , such as in deep learning @xcite , the approach followed by reservoir computing , especially when applied to real systems , is to find an appropriate form of physics that exhibits rich dynamics , thereby allowing us to outsource a part of the computation .",
    "nevertheless , no quantum physical system has been employed yet as a physical reservoir .    here",
    "we formulate quantum reservoir computing ( qrc ) and show , through a number of numerical experiments , that disordered quantum dynamics can be used as a powerful reservoir .",
    "although there have been several prominent proposals on utilising quantum physics in the context of machine learning  @xcite , they are based on sophisticatedly synthesised quantum circuits on a full - fledged universal quantum computer .",
    "contrary to these software approaches , the approach followed by qrc is to exploit the complexity of natural ( disordered ) quantum dynamics for information processing , as it is .",
    "here disordered quantum dynamics means that couplings are random , and hence no fine tuning of the parameters of the hamiltonian is required .",
    "any quantum chaotic ( non - integrable ) system can be harnessed , and its computational capabilities are specified .",
    "this is a great advantage , because we can utilise existing quantum simulators or complex quantum systems as resources to boost information processing . among existing works on",
    "quantum machine learning  @xcite , our approach is the first attempt to exploit quantum systems for temporal machine learning tasks , which essentially require a memory effect to the system . as we will see below , our benchmark results show that quantum systems consisting of 57 qubits already exhibit a powerful performance comparable to the esns of 100 - 500 nodes .",
    "not only its computational power , qrc will also provide us an operational means to approach complex real - time quantum dynamics . while there had been a missing operational link between classical chaos and quantum chaotic systems manifested by a wigner - dyson type statistics of the energy level spacing  @xcite , it is quite natural to connect them via the qrc framework naturally as an emulation of classical chaos by quantum chaotic systems .",
    "moreover , since complex quantum dynamics is ubiquitous , this framework provides us new operational understanding of quantum physics , such as quantum simulation , thermodynamics in closed quantum system and fast scrambling in black hole .",
    "is injected into the quantum system . the signal @xmath0 is obtained from each qubit .",
    "( b ) comparison between conventional ( upper ) and quantum ( lower ) reservoir computing approaches .",
    "note that the circles in the qrc do not represent qubits , but the basis of the hilbert space like the nodes in quantum walk  @xcite .",
    "the true nodes correspond to a subset of basis of the operator space that are directly monitored by the ensemble measurements .",
    "the hidden nodes correspond to the remaining degrees of freedom .",
    ", width=302 ]      in this subsection , we will explain how to describe quantum system and dynamics for the readers who are not familiar with quantum information .",
    "the minimum unit of information in quantum physics is a quantum bit ( qubit ) , which consists of a two - level quantum system , namely a vector in a two - dimensional complex vector space of spanned by @xmath1 .",
    "let us consider a quantum system consisting of @xmath2 qubits , which is described as a tensor product space of a complex vector space of two dimensions . a pure quantum state is represented by a state vector @xmath3 in a @xmath4-dimensional complex vector space .",
    "we may also consider a statistical ( classical ) mixture of the states of the pure states , which can be described by a @xmath5 hermitian matrix @xmath6 known as a density matrix . for a closed quantum system , the time evolution for a time interval @xmath7 is given by a unitary operator @xmath8 generated by a hermitian operator @xmath9 called hamiltonian .",
    "specifically , for the density matrix the time evolution is given by @xmath10 where the hamiltonian @xmath9 is an @xmath5 hermitian matrix and defines the dynamics of the quantum system .",
    "measurements in quantum system is described by a set of projective operators @xmath11 , which satisfies @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "then the probability to obtain the measurement outcome @xmath14 for the state @xmath6 is given by @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "the state after the measurement gets a backaction and is given by @xmath16}$ ] .",
    "that is , a single quantum system inevitably disturbed by the projective measurement . by repeating the projective measurements",
    ", we can calculate average values @xmath17 $ ] of an observable @xmath18 . 0 in general , measurements in quantum system",
    "is described by measurement operators @xmath19 , which satisfy @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 means that @xmath23 , namely positive semidefinite ) .",
    "the probability obtaining @xmath14 and the post - measurement state are given by @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "such a generalized measurement is called a povm ( positive operator valued measure ) measurement and can be realized by a projective measurement with an ancilla system .",
    "here we consider an ensemble quantum system , where the system consists of a huge number of the copies of @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath26 .",
    "cold atomic ensembles and liquid or solid state molecules are natural candidates of such an ensemble quantum system . for example , in an nmr ( nuclear magnetic resonance ) spin ensemble system , we have typically @xmath27 copies of the same molecules  @xcite . nuclear spin degree of freedoms of them can be employed as the quantum system , like nmr spin ensemble quantum computers or synthetic dimensions of ultra cold atoms for quantum simulations .",
    "we here assume that we can obtain the signals as a macroscopic observable from the ensemble quantum system directly , where the ensemble quantum system and the probe system are coupled by an extremely weak interaction .",
    "actually , the nmr bulk ensemble average measurement is done in this way .",
    "there is almost no backaction , or backaction is much smaller than other imperfections like the t@xmath28 relaxation  @xcite . in qrc , we make an active use of such a property of the ensemble quantum systems to exploit the complex quantum dynamics on the large degrees of freedom .      as nodes of the network of the qr",
    ", we use an orthogonal basis of quantum states .",
    "the idea is similar to the quantum walks  @xcite , where each individual node is defined not by qubits ( subsystems ) but by basis states like @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath2 qubits , we have @xmath30 basis states for a pure quantum state",
    ". moreover , here we employ the density matrix in general , we define the nodes of the network by an orthogonal basis of the operator space of the density matrices . by using the hilbert - schmidt inner product ,",
    "the density matrix can be represented as a vector @xmath31 on a @xmath32-dimensional operator space . here",
    "the @xmath14-th coefficient @xmath33 of @xmath31 is defined by @xmath34 $ ] by using the set of @xmath2-qubit products of the pauli operators @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 ) .",
    "specifically , we choose the first @xmath2 elements such that @xmath37 for convenience in the definition of the observables later .    in this operator space ,",
    "the time evolution is reformulated as a linear map for the vector @xmath31 : @xmath38 here @xmath39 is a @xmath40 matrix whose element is defined by @xmath41.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] owing to the unitarity of the dynamics @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 .",
    "if the system is coupled to an external system for a measurement and/or a feedback operation , the time evolution ( for the density matrix ) is not given by the conjugation of the unitary operator @xmath44 ; instead , it is generally given by a complete positive trace preserving ( cptp ) map @xmath45 for the density matrix @xmath6 .",
    "even in such a case , the dynamics is linear , and hence the time evolution for @xmath46 is given in a linear form : @xmath47 where the matrix element is defined @xmath48 .",
    "\\label{eq : cptpmap}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to exploit quantum dynamics for information processing , we have to introduce an input and the signals of the quantum system ( see fig .",
    "[ figxx ] ( a ) ) .",
    "suppose @xmath49 is an input sequence , where @xmath50 can be a binary ( @xmath51 ) or a continuous variable ( @xmath52 $ ] ) .",
    "a temporal learning task here is to find , using the quantum system , a nonlinear function @xmath53 such that the mean square error between @xmath54 and a target ( teacher ) output @xmath55 for a given task becomes minimum .",
    "to do so , at each time @xmath56 , the input signal @xmath50 is injected into a qubit , say the @xmath57st qubit , by replacing ( or by using measurement and feedback ) the @xmath57st qubit with the state @xmath58 , where latexmath:[\\ ] ] where the subsequent 17 timesteps that are used for the computation of @xmath248 were chosen because they correspond to approximately one full `` loop '' of the attractor .",
    "figure [ figsi3 ] plots the behaviour of @xmath248 for four cases .",
