    "polarimetry is a powerful diagnostic of specific phenomena at work in cosmic sources in the radio - wave and optical energy bands , but very few results are available at high photon energies : the only significant observation in the x - gamma energy range , to date , is the measurement of a linear polarisation fraction of @xmath0 of the 2.6kev emission of the crab nebula by a bragg polarimeter on board oso-8 @xcite . at higher energies , hard - x - ray and soft - gamma - ray telescopes that have flown to space in the past",
    "( comptel @xcite , batse@xcite ) were not optimized for polarimetry , and their sensitivity to polarisation was poor .",
    "presently active missions ( integral ibis@xcite and spi @xcite ) have provided some improvement , with , in particular , mildly significant measurements of @xmath1 ( 130 to 440 kev @xcite ) and @xmath2 ( 200 to 800 kev @xcite ) for the crab nebula .",
    "a number of compton polarimeter / telescope projects have been developed , some of which also propose to record photon conversions to @xmath3 pairs .",
    "a variety of technologies have been considered , such as scintillator arrays ( pogo @xcite , grape @xcite , polar @xcite ) , si or ge microstrip detectors ( mega @xcite , astrogam @xcite ) or combinations of these ( si @xmath4 labr@xmath5 for grips @xcite , si @xmath4 csi(tl ) for tigre @xcite ) , semiconductor pixel detectors ( cipher @xcite ) and liquid xenon ( lxegrit @xcite ) time projection chambers ( tpc ) . in most compton telescopes",
    "the reconstruction of the direction of the incident photon provides an uncertainty area which has the shape of a thin cone arc .",
    "the tracking of the recoil electron from the first compton interaction with a measurement of the direction of the recoil momentum , as is within reach with a gas tpc , allows to decrease the length of the arc and therefore to improve dramatically the sensitivity of the detector ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "some of these telescopes are sensitive to photon energies up to tens of mev in the compton mode , but their sensitivity to polarisation above a few mev is either nonexistent or undocumented .",
    "as is well known , the sensitivity to polarisation of compton scattering is excellent at low energies ( thomson scattering ) , as the polarisation asymmetry @xmath6 , also known as the modulation factor and defined by the phase - space dependence of the differential cross section , @xmath7 } \\right ] , \\label{eq : def : diff : cross : section : compton}\\ ] ] reaches @xmath8 at a polar angle @xmath9 of @xmath10 ( fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this expression , @xmath11 is the azimuthal angle , that is the angle between the scattering plane and the direction of polarisation of the incident photon .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath6 is decreasing with energy , and as the precision of the measurement scales as @xmath12 when the background noise is negligible and where @xmath13 is the number of signal event , the sensitivity of compton polarimetry decreases at high energies . with the goal of a quantitative assessment of this sensitivity , in this paper we compute the average polarisation asymmetry @xmath14 from the klein - nishina differential cross section on free electrons at rest @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 is defined from the differential cross section in @xmath11 , that is after the full differential cross section ( eq . ( [ eq : def : diff : cross : section : compton ] ) ) has been integrated over the other variables that describe the final state : @xmath15 } \\right ] .",

    "the asymmetry , the non - evenness of the @xmath40 distribution makes the non - zero average due to the beam polarisation explicit .",
    "moment s methods are equivalent to a likelihood analysis in the case where the pdf is a linear function of the variables that one aims to measure , as is the case here , but they are much simpler to instantiate as one just has to compute @xmath69 , and average it over the whole statistics . although the analysis of experimental data is beyond the scope of this paper , the following considerations apply :    * background subtraction reduces to a simple subtraction in computing the average of @xmath40 .",
    "their @xmath70-dimensional parametrization is not needed .",
    "* likelihood methods need the use of a @xmath70-dimensional parametrization of the acceptance , or efficiency , for correction .",
    "this is pretty simple in the case of compton scattering for which the final state is described by only two variables , but for higher - dimensional systems , producing enough monte carlo ( mc ) statistics and determining a parametrization becomes a nightmare : in that case the use of a moments - based efficiency correction becomes mandatory ( for a real - case presentation see eg . , section iv.a , eqs .",
