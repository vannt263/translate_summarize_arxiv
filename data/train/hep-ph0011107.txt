    "this talk is mainly based on earlier papers  @xcite on the light scalars and on a more recent one @xcite on the  in charm decay , including a few new comments .",
    "first we shall discuss the evidence for the light  and explain how one can understand the controversial light scalar mesons with unitarized quark model ( uqm ) , which includes most well established theoretical constraints :    * adler zeroes as required by chiral symmetry , * all light two - pseudoscalar ( pp ) thresholds with flavor symmetric couplings in a coupled channel framework * physically acceptable analyticity , and * unitarity .",
    "a unique feature of this model is that it simultaneously describes the whole scalar nonet and one obtains a good representation of a large set of relevant data .",
    "only six parameters , which all have a clear physical interpretation , are needed , such as an overall coupling constant , the bare mass of the @xmath11 or @xmath12 state , the extra mass for a strange quark ( @xmath13 mev ) , a cutoff parameter ( @xmath14 gev / c ) .    after describing our understanding of the @xmath1 nonet",
    ", we discuss the recently measured @xmath15 decay , where the  is clearly seen as the dominant peak .",
    "the interpretation of the nature of lightest scalar mesons has been controversial for long .",
    "there is no general agreement on where are the @xmath1 states , is there a glueball among the light scalars , are some of the scalars multiquark or @xmath16 bound states ? as for the @xmath0 , authors do not even agree on its existence as a fundamental hadron , although the number of supporters is growing rapidly .",
    "= 12 cm = 6 .",
    "cm    a light scalar - isoscalar meson ( the ) , with a mass of twice the constituent @xmath17 quark mass , or @xmath18 mev , coupling strongly to @xmath19 is of importance in all nambu  jona - lasinio - like ( njl - like ) models for dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry . in these models",
    "the @xmath0 field obtains a vacuum expectation value , i.e. , one has a   @xmath1 condensate in the vacuum , which is crucial for the understanding of all hadron masses , as it explains in a simple way the difference between the light constituent and chiral quark mass",
    ". then most of the nucleon mass is generated by its coupling to the @xmath0 , which acts like an effective higgs - like boson for the hadron spectrum .    in fig .",
    "1 we have plotted with filled circles the results of 22 different analyses on the  pole position , which are included in the 2000 edition of the review of particle physics @xcite under the entry @xmath20 or . most of these find a  pole position near 500-i250 mev .    also , at a recent meeting in kyoto @xcite devoted to the @xmath0 , many groups reported preliminary analyzes , which find the  resonance parameters in the same region .",
    "these are plotted as triangles in fig . 1 . here",
    "it was not possible to distinguish between breit - wigner parameters and pole positions , which of course can differ by several 100 mev for the same data .",
    "it must also be noted that many of the triangles in fig .",
    "1 rely on the same raw data and come from preliminary analyzes not yet published .",
    "we also included in fig .",
    "1 ( with a star ) the  parameters obtained from the recent e791 experiment at fermilab @xcite , where 46% of the @xmath21 dalitz plot is @xmath22 . the open circle in the same figure represents the  parameters extracted from the cleo analysis of @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the njl model is an effective theory which is believed to be related to qcd at low energies , when one has integrated out the gluon fields .",
    "it involves a linear realization of chiral symmetry .",
    "after bosonization of the njl model one finds essentially the linear sigma model ( ) as an approximate effective theory for the scalar and pseudoscalar meson sector .",
    "about 30 years ago schechter and ueda @xcite wrote down the @xmath24  for the meson sector involving a scalar and a pseudoscalar nonet .",
    "this ( renormalizable ) theory has only 6 parameters , out of which 5 can be fixed by the pseudoscalar masses and decay constants ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the sixth parameter for the ozi rule violating 4-point coupling must be small .",
    "one can then predict , with no free parameters , the tree level scalar masses @xcite , which turn out to be not far from the lightest experimental masses , although the two quantities are exactly the same thing but can differ for the same model and data by over 100 mev .",
    "the important thing is that the scalar masses are predicted to be near the lightest experimentally seen scalar masses , and not in the 1500 mev region where many authors want to put the lightest @xmath1 scalars . the  is predicted @xcite at 620 mev with a very large width ( @xmath18 mev ) , which well agrees with fig .",
    "the @xmath26 is predicted at 1128 mev , the @xmath3 at 1190 mev , and the @xmath27 at 1120 mev , which is surprisingly good considering that loop effects are large .",
    "in figs .  2 - 4 we show the obtained fits to the @xmath28 , @xmath19 s -waves and to the  resonance peak in @xmath29 .",
    "the partial wave amplitude ( pwa ) in the case of one  resonance , such as the @xmath26 , can be written as : @xmath30},\\ ] ] where : [ pwa ] im(s)&=&_i im_i(s ) [ impi ] = -_i _ i^2(s - s_a , i)e^-k_i^2/k_0 ^ 2 ( s - s_th , i )  , + re(s)&=&1^_s_th,1 ds  . here",
    "the coupling constants @xmath31 are related by flavour symmetry and ozi rule , such that there is only one over all parameter @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath33 are the positions of the adler zeroes , which are near @xmath34 .",
    "( 1 ) can be looked upon as a more general breit - wigner form , where the mass parameter is replaced by an @xmath35-dependent function ,  the running mass \" @xmath36 .    in the flavourless channels the situation is a little more complicated than in eq .",
    "( 1 ) since one has both  and states , requiring a two dimensional mass matrix ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . note that the sum runs over all light pp thresholds , which means three for the : @xmath37 and three for the : @xmath38 , while for the @xmath39 s there are five channels : @xmath40 .    in fig .",
    "5 we show , as an example , the running mass , @xmath41 , and the width - like function , @xmath42 , for the i=1 channel .",
    "the crossing point of the running mass with @xmath35 gives the @xmath43 mass of the .",
    "the magnitude of the  component in the  is determined by @xmath44 , which is large in the resonance region just below the  threshold .",
    "these functions fix the pwa of eq .",
    "( 1 ) and fig .  3 .",
    "6 the running mass and width - like function for the strange channel are shown .",
    "these fix the shape of the @xmath28 phase shift and absorption parameters in fig .",
    "1 . as can be seen from figs .  1 - 3 , the model gives a good description of the relevant data .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the  was missed because only poles nearest to the physical region were looked for , and the possibility of the resonance doubling phenomenon , discussed below , was overlooked .",
    "only a little later we realized with roos @xcite that two resonances (  and @xmath45 ) can emerge although only one @xmath5 bare state is put in .",
    "then we had to look deeper into the second sheet and found the broad  as the dominant singularity at low mass .",
    "in fact , it was pointed out by morgan and pennington  @xcite that for each  state there are , in general , apart from the nearest pole , also image poles , usually located far from the physical region . as explained in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , some of these can ( for a large enough coupling and sufficiently heavy threshold ) come so close to the physical region that they make new resonances . and ,",
    "in fact , there are more than four physical poles with different isospin , in the output spectrum of the uqm model , although only four bare states , of _ the same nonet _  @xcite , are put in!. the  and the  of the model thus turn out to be two manifestations of the same state .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details )",
    ". there can be two crossings ( see fig .",
    "7 ) with the running mass @xmath46 , one near the threshold and another at higher mass , and each one is related to a different pole at the second sheet ( or , if the coupling is strong enough , the lower one could even become a bound state pole , below the threshold , on the first sheet ) .",
    "similarly the  and the  could be two manifestations of the @xmath47 state . only after realizing that this resonance doubling is important the light and broad  was found in the model @xcite . in table 1",
    "we list the pole positions of the six relevant poles , all manifestations of the same @xmath1 nonet .    .",
    "the pole positions of the resonances in the s - wave @xmath48 amplitudes  @xmath49 .",
    "the first resonance is the  which we name here @xmath50 .",
    "the two following are both different manifestations of the same @xmath5 state .",
    "the last entry is similarly an image pole of the , which in an improved fit could represent the @xmath51 .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath52 for the @xmath53 or @xmath0 is with respect to @xmath54 , while for the two heavier @xmath39 s it is with respect to @xmath5 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     another important effect that the model can explain is the large mass difference between the @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "because of this large mass splitting many authors argue that the @xmath26 and @xmath3 are not  states , since in addition to being very close to the  threshold , they are much lighter than the first strange scalar , the @xmath27 .",
    "naively one expects a mass difference between the strange and nonstrange meson to be of the order of the strange - nonstrange quark mass difference , or a little over 100 mev .    figs . 5 and 6",
    "explain why one can easily understand this large @xmath57 mass splitting as a secondary effect of the large pseudoscalar mass splittings , and because of the large mass shifts coming from the loop diagrams involving the pp thresholds .",
    "if one puts figs . 4 and 5 on top of each other one sees that the 3 thresholds @xmath58 all lie relatively close to the @xmath26 , and all 3 contribute to a large mass shift . on the other hand , for the @xmath27 , the @xmath59 related thresholds ( @xmath60 ) lie far apart from the @xmath56 , while the @xmath61 nearly decouples because of the physical value of the pseudoscalar mixing angle .",
    "this large mass of the @xmath27 is also one of the reasons why some authors want to have a lighter strange meson , the @xmath62 , near 800 mev .",
    "cherry and pennington @xcite recently have strongly argued against its existence .",
    "but , we heard carla gbel in her talk describing some evidence for such a light @xmath62 in the e791 data for @xmath63 . here",
    "the signal is much less evident , since , differently from the case of the @xmath0 , which is seen as a clear peak over background , the inclusion of a @xmath62 only improves the @xmath64 in the region dominated by the @xmath65 .",
    "perhaps one should try a more sophisticated breit - wigner amplitude for the s - wave , as that in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , before one can make more definite statements about the @xmath62 .",
    "possibly such a light @xmath62 could be understood in connection to the resonance doubling phenomenon discussed above and which we discussed with roos @xcite .",
    "the recent experiments studying charm decay to light hadrons are opening up a new experimental window for understanding light meson spectroscopy and especially the controversial scalar mesons , which are copiously produced in these decays .",
    "in particular we refer to the e791 study of the @xmath66 decay @xcite where it is shown how adding an intermediate scalar resonance with floating mass and width in the monte carlo program simulating the dalitz plot densities , allows for an excellent fit to data provided the mass and the width of this scalar resonance are @xmath67 mev and @xmath68 mev .",
    "this resonance is a very good candidate for the @xmath0 . to check this hypothesis we adopt the e791 experimental values for its mass and width and using a constituent",
    "quark meson model ( cqm ) for heavy - light meson decays @xcite we compute the @xmath69 non - leptonic process via _ factorization _",
    "@xcite , taking the coupling of the @xmath0 to the light quarks from the linear sigma model @xcite .",
    "in such a way one is directly assuming that the scalar state needed in the e791 analysis could be the quantum of the @xmath0 field of the linear sigma model .",
    "according to the cqm model and to factorization , the amplitude describing the @xmath69 decay can be written as a product of the semileptonic amplitude @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the axial quark current , and @xmath72 .",
    "the former is parameterized by two form factors , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , connected by the condition @xmath75 , while the latter is governed by the pion decay constant @xmath76 .",
    "as far as the product of the two above mentioned amplitudes is concerned , only the form factor @xmath74 comes into the expression of the @xmath69 amplitude . moreover we need to estimate it at @xmath77 , that is the physically realized kinematical situation .",
    "the cqm offers the possibility to compute this form factor through two quark - meson 1-loop diagrams that we call the _ direct _ and the _ polar _ contributions to @xmath74 .",
    "these quark - meson loops are possible since in the cqm one has effective vertices ( heavy quark)-(heavy meson)-(light quark ) that allow us to _ compute _ spectator - like diagrams in which the external lines represent incoming or outgoing heavy mesons while the internal lines are the constituent light quark and heavy quark propagators .    in figs . 8 and 9",
    "we show respectively the _ direct _ and the _ polar _ diagrams for the semileptonic amplitude @xmath78 , the former being characterized by the axial current directly attached to the constituent quark loop , the latter involving an intermediate @xmath79 or @xmath80 state .",
    "these two diagrams are computed with an analogous technique and one finally obtains a determination of the direct and polar form factors @xmath81 .",
    "the extrapolation to @xmath82 is safe for the direct form factor while is not perfectly under control for the polar form factor since the latter is more reliable at the pole @xmath83 , @xmath84 being the mass of the intermediate state in fig .",
    "we take into account the uncertainty introduced by this extrapolation procedure and signaled by the fact that we find @xmath85 ( computing @xmath86 from the polar diagram with @xmath87 intermediate polar state and @xmath88 from that with intermediate @xmath89 state ) .",
    "our estimate for @xmath90 is in reasonable agreement with an estimate of @xmath91 carried out in @xcite using the e791 data analysis and a breit - wigner like approximation for the @xmath0 .",
    "the meson - quark loops in figs . 8 and 9",
    "are computed substituting the meson vertices with the heavy meson field expressions found by heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) ( since cqm incorporates heavy quark and chiral symmetries ) and the quark lines with the propagators of the heavy and light constituent quarks .",
    "the light constituent mass @xmath92 is fixed by a njl - type gap equation that depends on @xmath92 , and on two cutoffs @xmath93 and @xmath94 in a proper time regularization scheme for the diverging integrals .",
    "the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath93 is fixed by the scale of chiral symmetry breaking , @xmath95 , and we consider @xmath96 gev .",
    "the remaining dependence of @xmath92 on the choice of the infrared cutoff @xmath94 has an expression similar to that of a ferromagnetic order parameter , @xmath97 being different from zero for @xmath94 values smaller than a particular @xmath98 , and zero for higher values .",
    "when @xmath94 ranges from @xmath99 to @xmath100 mev , the value of @xmath92 is almost constant , @xmath101 mev , dropping for higher @xmath94 values .",
    "a reasonable light constituent quark mass is certainly @xmath100 mev and this clearly leaves a @xmath100 mev open window for choosing the infrared cutoff . enforcing the kinematical condition for the meson to decay to its free constituent quarks , which must be possible since the cqm model does not incorporate confinement , requires @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "therefore we pick up the @xmath103 mev value .",
    "the results are quite stable against @xmath104 variations of the uv and ir cutoffs .",
    "the cqm semileptonic @xmath78 transition amplitude is represented by the loop integrals associated to the direct and to the polar contributions .",
    "the result of the integral computations must then be compared with the expression for the hadronic transition element @xmath105 and this allows to extract the desired @xmath106 form factors .",
    "an estimate of the weight of @xmath107 corrections can also be taken into account @xcite .",
    "this computation indicates that the scalar resonance described in the e791 paper can be consistently understood as the @xmath0 of the linear sigma model .",
    "of course a calculation such as the one here described calls for alternative calculations and/or explanations of the e791 data for a valuable and useful comparison of point of views on the @xmath0 nature .",
    "an often raised question is : why are the mass shifts required by unitarity so much more important for the scalars than , say , for the vector mesons ?",
    "the answer is very simple , and there are three main reasons :    * the scalar coupling to two pseudoscalars is very much larger than the corresponding coupling for the vectors , both experimentally and theoretically ( e.g. , spin counting gives 3 for the ratio of the two squared couplings ) . * for the scalars the thresholds are s - waves , giving nonlinear square root cusps in the @xmath108 function , whereas for the vectors the thresholds are p - waves , giving a smooth @xmath109 angular momentum and phase space factor . * chiral symmetry constraints , in particular adler zeroes , are important for the scalars when analyzing pseudoscalar scattering , and make , e.g. , @xmath110 very weak near the thresholds . in the case when a light scalar is produced in charm decay , as in e791 , these zeroes are less important .",
    ".2 cm    one could argue that the two states  and  are a kind of @xmath16 bound states ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , since these have a large component of @xmath16 in their wave functions . however , the dynamics of these states is quite different from that of normal two - hadron bound states . if one wants to consider them as bound states , it is the @xmath111 interaction which creates their binding energy , not the hyperfine interaction as in ref .",
    "thus , although they may spend most of their time as @xmath16 , they owe their existence to the   state .",
    "therefore , it is more natural to consider the  and  as two manifestations of the same   state .    the wave function of the @xmath26 ( and @xmath3 ) can be pictured as a relatively small core of  of typical  meson size ( 0.6 fm ) , which is surrounded by a much larger standing s - wave of virtual ( see fig .",
    "10 ) due to the fact that these resonances are just below the @xmath112 threshold and they strongly couple to @xmath16 .",
    "this picture also gives a physical explanation of the narrow width : in order to decay to @xmath29 , the  component must first virtually annihilate near the origin to .",
    "then the  can decay to @xmath29 as an ozi allowed decay .    finally , in sec . 5",
    ", we showed that the recent e791 data on @xmath69 can be understood in the cqm model assuming the @xmath0 to be predominantly a @xmath113 state , similar to the @xmath0 of the linear sigma model .",
