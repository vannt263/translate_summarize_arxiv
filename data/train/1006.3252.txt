    "in this paper we construct the abelian chern - simons topological quantum field theory directly from the theory of classical theta functions .",
    "it has been known for years , in the context of abelian chern - simons theory , that classical theta functions are related to low dimensional topology @xcite , @xcite .",
    "abelian chern - simons theory is considerably simpler than its non - abelian counterparts , and has been studied thoroughly ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) . here",
    "we do not start with abelian chern - simons theory , but instead give a direct construction of the associated topological quantum field theory based on the theory of classical theta functions and using skein modules .",
    "we consider classical theta functions in the representation theoretic point of view introduced by andr weil @xcite . from this point of view",
    ", the space of theta functions is endowed with an action of a finite heisenberg group ( the schrdinger representation ) , which induces , via a stone - von neumann theorem , the hermite - jacobi action of the modular group .",
    "all this structure is what we shall mean by the theory of theta functions .",
    "we show how the finite heisenberg group , or rather its group algebra and its schrdinger representation on the space of theta functions , lead to algebras of curves on surfaces and their actions on spaces of curves in handlebodies .",
    "these notions are formalized using skein modules .",
    "the hermite - jacobi representation of the modular group on theta functions is a discrete analogue of the metaplectic representation .",
    "the modular group acts by automorphisms that are a particular case of the fourier - mukai transform ; in this paper we will refer to them as discrete fourier transforms .",
    "we will show that discrete fourier transforms can be expressed as linear combinations of curves .",
    "a careful analysis of their structure and of their relationship to the schrdinger representation yields the reshetikhin - turaev formula @xcite of invariants of 3-dimensional manifolds , for @xmath0 chern - simons theory .    as a corollary of our point of view",
    "we obtain an explanation of why the composition of discrete fourier transforms and the non - additivity of the signature of 4-dimensional manifolds obey the same formula .",
    "the paper uses results and terminology from the theory of theta functions , quantum mechanics , and low dimensional topology . to make it accessible to different audiences we include a fair amount of detail .",
    "in section 2 we review the theory of classical theta functions on the jacobian variety of a surface .",
    "the action of the finite heisenberg group on theta functions can be defined by translations in the associated line bundle , as it is usually done in algebraic geometry , or via weyl quantization of the jacobian variety in the holomorphic polarization .",
    "we follow the second approach , because in our opinion it explains better the combinatorial picture of this action .",
    "in fact it has been discovered in recent years that chern - simons theory is related to weyl quantization @xcite , @xcite , and this was the starting point of our paper .",
    "section 3 describes the weyl quantization of the jacobian in the real polarization , and compares it to that in the holomorphic polarization . building on this",
    ", the next section exhibits the combinatorial picture of theta functions , the action of the finite heisenberg group , and the hermite - jacobi action .    up to this point topology has not come into play , but in section 5 we show that the combinatorial picture of the theory of theta functions is topological in nature .",
    "we reformulate it using algebras of curves on surfaces , together with their action on skeins of curves in handlebodies which are associated to the linking number .    in section 6",
    "we derive a formula for the discrete fourier transform as a skein .",
    "this formula is interpreted in terms of surgery in the cylinder over the surface .",
    "section 7 analizes the exact egorov identity which relates the hermite - jacobi action to the schrdinger representation .",
    "this analysis shows that the topological operation of handle slides is allowed over the skeins that represent discrete fourier transforms , and this yields in the next section to the reshetikhin - turaev formula for invariants of 3-dimensional manifolds , and to a @xmath0-topological quantum field theory .",
    "we point out that the above - mentioned formula was introduced in an ad - hoc manner by its authors in @xcite , however this paper shows how to arrive at this formula in a natural way , at least in the context of the @xmath0-theory .",
    "section 9 shows how to associate to the discrete fourier transform a 4-dimensional manifold .",
    "this will explain why the cocycle of the hermite - jacobi action is related to that governing the non - additivity of the signature of 4-dimensional manifolds @xcite .",
    "section 10 should be taken as a conclusion ; it brings everything to the context of chern - simons theory .",

    "moreover , @xmath24 has a canonical symplectic form , which in the @xmath28-coordinates is given by @xmath30 the jacobian variety with the complex structure and symplectic form @xmath31 is a khler manifold .",
    "the symplectic form induces a poisson bracket for smooth functions on the jacobian , given by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the hamiltonian vector field defined by @xmath34 .    the _ classical theta functions _",
    "show up when quantizing @xmath24 in the complex polarization , in the direction of this poisson bracket .",
    "for the purpose of this paper , we perform this quantization in the case where planck s constant is the reciprocal of an _ even _ positive integer : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "the hilbert space of the quantization consists of the holomorphic sections of a line bundle obtained as the tensor product of a line bundle with curvature @xmath38 and the square root of the canonical line bundle .",
