    "the @xmath0 resonance has been drawing intensive attention . on top of the long - standing problem of its structure ( three - quark versus hadronic molecule ) ,",
    "new issues have been discussed recently : the influence of the @xmath0 to the @xmath1 interaction in relation to the possible antikaon bound states in nuclei , and the two - pole structure of the scattering amplitude for the @xmath0 .",
    "these issues are stimulated by the recent experimental studies as well as theoretical developments of the nonperturbative chiral coupled - channel dynamics .",
    "here we address several issues of the @xmath0 in connection with the renewed interests on this resonance .",
    "the low energy hadron physics is systematically studied by chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) . however ,",
    "when the hadron interaction is strongly attractive , we certainly need a nonperturbative technique beyond chpt .",
    "this is indeed the case for the @xmath4 meson - baryon scattering where the leading order interaction in chpt reads @xmath5 and the diagonal couplings @xmath6 and @xmath7 are attractive enough to generate singularities of scattering amplitude . a nonperturbative chiral approach has been developed in refs .  , where the coupled - channel scattering amplitude @xmath8 is determined by solving the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation @xmath9 with the interaction kernel @xmath10 in eq .  .",
    "the amplitude constructed in this way reproduces well the @xmath11 scattering observables , with the @xmath0 resonance being generated from the coupled - channel meson - baryon dynamics .",
    "this framework was applied to the various hadron scatterings with the pseudoscalar meson , successfully reproducing experimental data of the scatterings and resonance properties .",
    "these remarkable successes in a variety of channels can be understood that the leading order chiral interaction is determined model independently,@xcite which is the driving force to generate the resonances.@xcite    an interesting observation has been made@xcite that the @xmath0 resonance is associated with two poles of the scattering amplitude close each other with the same quantum numbers . a simple explanation of this structure is given in ref .  ; both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels are attractive , and each attractive interaction provides one singularity . since the sign and the strength of the interaction   are determined by the chiral low energy theorem , the two - pole structure of the @xmath0 is a natural consequence of the chiral symmetry in the coupled - channel @xmath1-@xmath2 system .",
    "the study of possible bound state of antikaon in nuclei is a hot topic in nuclear physics.@xcite the structure of the @xmath0 is of great importance to these studies , because the only experimental information below @xmath1 threshold is the spectrum of the @xmath0 in @xmath2 channel .    in order to study the few - body nucleus with an antikaon ,",
    "a realistic @xmath1 potential is needed , which reproduces the scattering amplitude in vacuum . in order to derive such a potential based on chiral dynamics,@xcite",
    "we first construct the single - channel @xmath1 interaction which incorporates the full coupled - channel effects .",
    "next we approximate this interaction by a local potential in schrdinger equation , keeping the scattering amplitude the same with the prediction of chiral dynamics .    an important observation in ref .",
    "is that the resonance structure in the @xmath1 amplitude appears at around 1420 mev , not in the nominal position of 1405 mev observed in @xmath2 spectrum .",
    "the physics behind this observation is the strong @xmath2 dynamics which eventually leads to the two - pole structure of the @xmath0 . as a consequence of the weaker binding energy ,",
    "the strength of the effective single - channel @xmath1 interaction is roughly one half of the phenomenological potential.@xcite the application of this chiral su(3 ) potential to the three - body @xmath12 system@xcite provides a smaller binding energy than the purely phenomenological approach .",
    "it is also found that the local potential approximation works only at around the threshold and overestimates the amplitude obtained by the bs equation  , when extrapolated down to @xmath13 mev .",
    "this indicates the substantial uncertainty in the subthreshold extrapolation of the @xmath1 interaction , which is relevant for the discussion of the deeply bound antikaons in nuclei .",
    "one of the recent interests in hadron physics is the structure of the hadron resonances .",
    "there are several discussions about the structure of the baryon resonances : three - quark versus five - quark , or hadronic molecule versus quark originated structure . in principle",
    ", all these structures eventually stem from qcd dynamics and mix each other .",
    "nevertheless it helps our physical understanding to decompose a resonance state , and inspect the dominant component for the resonance .",
    "for instance , the @xmath0 can be schematically written as @xmath14 where the third term is understood as the dynamical meson - baryon component other than the cdd pole,@xcite which could be identified within the scattering theory of hadrons.@xcite one naively expects that the baryonic resonances in chiral dynamics are dominated by this component , but this is not always true and substantial cdd pole contribution was found for some resonances.@xcite here we attempt to unveil the structure in eq .   by studying the @xmath3 scaling of the @xmath0 poles@xcite and by utilizing the renormalization condition.@xcite",
    "the study of the @xmath3 behavior is a powerful tool to clarify the quark content of hadron resonances,@xcite since the @xmath3 scalings are known for @xmath15 mesons and @xmath16 baryons.@xcite in ref .",
    ", we study the @xmath3 behavior of the @xmath0 resonance in chiral dynamics . because of the nontrivial @xmath3 dependence of the leading order chiral interaction found in ref .  , the attractive @xmath1 interaction remains finite in the large @xmath3 limit . as a consequence , the @xmath1 bound state exists in the large @xmath3 limit .",
    "the two poles of the @xmath0 behave differently from the scaling of ordinary @xmath16 baryons , indicating that the @xmath17 component in eq .",
    "does not dominate the @xmath0 .    in the framework of nonperturbative chiral dynamics ,",
    "we propose a method to distinguish the dynamical component from the cdd pole contribution by studying the physical meaning of the renormalization condition.@xcite we point out that the previous phenomenological chiral models have included the cdd pole contribution in the loop function . with a natural renormalization condition",
    ", we extract the cdd pole contribution hidden in the loop function into the kernel interaction @xmath18 , as it should be in the framework of the @xmath19 method . by examining the phenomenological chiral models , we find that the amplitude for the @xmath20 requires the cdd pole at around 1.7 gev , while that for the @xmath0 lies at an irelevant energy of 17 gev .",
    "this implies that the @xmath21 component dominates the @xmath0 , while substantial quark - originate contributions @xmath22 are expected in the @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath0 is very unique baryon resonance , and plays an important role in various fields of nuclear and hadron physics .",
    "the strong @xmath1 interaction is the principle ingredient of the @xmath0 , but at the same time we should appreciate the strong @xmath2 interaction , from the viewpoint of chiral symmetry .",
    "the two - pole structure of the @xmath0 is no longer a theoretical issue of hadron spectroscopy , but is relevant for the discussion of @xmath1 phenomenology . in order to understand the structure of the @xmath0 ,",
    "we make use of the @xmath3 scaling and renormalization condition .",
    "both the analyses consistently imply that the @xmath0 would be dominated by the dynamical content .",
    "the precise experimental data on @xmath1 scattering length and @xmath2 spectrum is highly desired in order to reduce the theoretical uncertainty to explore the strongly interacting @xmath1-@xmath2 system , and to clarify the structure of the @xmath0 resonance .",
