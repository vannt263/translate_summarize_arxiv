    "in this study we are concerned with constituent quark models where the confinement interaction contains the two - body color operator @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this means to assume that the one - gluon exchange picture survives to all distances .",
    "there is no real justification for applying this rule to the confinement , except simplicity .",
    "this relatively easy model has been widely used in baryon spectroscopy together with a hyperfine interaction generated either by the one - gluon exchange @xcite or by the goldstone boson ( pseudoscalar meson ) exchange @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 model has often been revived as being a convenient framework for studying @xmath3 systems ( tetraquarks ) , see e. g. ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath4 systems ( pentaquarks ) , see e. g. ref .",
    "@xcite or @xmath5 system ( the nucleon - nucleon problem ) , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the present work is devoted to baryons , seen as @xmath0 systems .",
    "the starting point is the observation that the presence of the @xmath2 color operator implies that the hamiltonian , besides color singlets , also possesses color octet and decuplet states at low energies .",
    "these states are undesirable .",
    "their existence is in conflict with the experiment and with conclusions drawn from lattice or continuous formulations of qcd in the confining phase . in practice",
    ", these states have tacitly been ignored , relying on the assumption that they do not exist . however , as shown below , colored states are found close to singlets in the spectrum of consituent quark models .",
    "therefore they should either be shifted to higher energies , by a change in the dynamics of the quark model , so that they could be ignored , or otherwise transformed into colorless states by coupling to gluons as for example in @xcite , or to color octet sea @xmath6 pairs as for example in @xcite .",
    "a solution in the first direction has recently been proposed by dmitrasinovic @xcite .",
    "although ocd has a local exact su@xmath7(3 ) symmetry , in qcd - inspired potential models this symmetry appears as global , by construction .",
    "the observation was that by considering only two - body confining forces in a hamiltonian model implies that the global su@xmath7(3 ) symmetry is implemented only in a restricted way , namely the hamiltonian is expressed in terms of the quadratic ( casimir ) invariant operator of su(3 ) only .",
    "more generally , one could express any quark model hamiltonian inspired by qcd in terms of every su(3 ) invariant operator . based on this argument , in ref .",
    "@xcite a three - quark confining potential that depends on the cubic invariant operator of su(3 ) has been added to the usual two - body confinement . in a qualitative way",
    ", it was shown that such an interaction can increase the gap between the singlet and color states , provided its strength has a specific sign and range .",
    "besides its implications on the spectrum of ordinary @xmath0 systems , its role in exotic @xmath8 hadrons has also been considered .    the three - body confinement interaction of ref .",
    "@xcite has subsequently been analysed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of a harmonic oscillator confinement where the size of its effect on the gap between the color and singlet states in the spectrum of a @xmath0 system has been estimated .",
    "also the @xmath5 system with relevance to the nucleon - nucleon problem has been discussed .",
    "below we first show explicitly how much the singlet and color states of a realistic constituent quark model appear close to each other .",
    "next , by introducing a three - body confinement force related to the cubic invariant of su(3 ) , we demonstrate that one can separate them largely enough so that the color states can be ignored . for this purpose , here we consider the semirelativistic constituent quark model of ref .",
    "@xcite , into which we implement a three - body confinement interaction . by using the faddeev approach of ref .",
    "@xcite we calculate the lowest singlet , octet and decuplet states of a three - quark system , with this additional three - body confinement force .",
    "here we present the nucleon sector , namely s=1/2 and i=1/2 . the lowest color octet and decuplet",
    "@xmath0 states compatible with the pauli principle are displayed in tables [ octet ] and [ decuplet ] respectively . for orientation ,",
    "their excitation energy @xmath9 , estimated in a two - body harmonic oscillator confinement , is shown in the last column . in the same harmonic oscillator confinement",
    "the first colorless negative parity state is 395 mev above the ground state .",
    "therefore one can see that the @xmath10 color octet and decuplet states appear substantially below this negative parity state . in the following",
    "we shall consider only the lowest color states , namely the @xmath10 and @xmath11 octets and the @xmath10 decuplet .",
    "it is necessary to displace all color states at energies where they can safely be neglected , if the nucleon resonances are to be interpreted as pure @xmath0 excitations .",
    "this can indeed be achieved by an additional three - body force , as shown below .",
    "the realistic total hamiltonian presently under discussion has the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the momentum and the constituent mass of the quark @xmath15 , @xmath16 the two - body confinement , @xmath17 the three - body confinement and @xmath18 the hyperfine interaction .",
    "taking @xmath17 = 0 one recovers the chiral constituent quark model of ref .",
    "@xcite which is the simplest semirelativistic version ( no tensor , no spin - orbit ) of the model originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the hyperfine interaction is spin and flavor dependent .",
    "the origin of such an interaction is thought to be the pseudoscalar meson exchange between quarks .",
    "this model , either in a nonrelativistic or a semirelativistic form , reproduces well the spectra of light baryons and in particular the correct order of positive and negative parity states .",
    "it has been shown that the addition of a tensor interaction to the spin - spin interaction in the goldstone boson exchange model has a minor effect and thus maintains the quality of the spectrum @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the present study where the emphasis is made on the confining interaction the tensor force can be ignored .",
    "although we have chosen a particular model , we expect our conclusions to be relevant for any reasonable constituent quark model with three valence quarks .",
    "the detailed parametrization of @xmath18 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and we do not reproduce it here , the main emphasis being laid on the confinement potential .",
    "we use a @xmath16 term of the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the color charge operator of the quark @xmath15 , @xmath21 are the gell - mann matrices and @xmath22 with @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 mev as in ref .",
    "the color part of @xmath16 is consistent with refs .",
    "@xcite but different from that of @xcite .",
    "it stems from the stability condition of a @xmath6 pair but it depends on an arbitrary constant which is fixed to 7/3 .",
    "anyhow , we rescale this interaction such as to reproduce the spectrum obtained in @xcite ( see below ) .    the three - body confinement interaction has the form @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the radial part and @xmath28 is the color operator @xmath29 with @xmath30 some real constants , symmetric under any permutation of indices and defined by the anticommutator of the gell - mann matrices as @xmath31 .",
    "the operator ( [ 3b ] ) can be rewritten in terms of the two independent invariant operators of su(3 ) as @xmath32~,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the quadratic ( casimir ) and @xmath34 the cubic invariant .",
    "the expectation values of ( [ eq4 ] ) can thus easily be obtained from the eigenvalue of @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xcite for any irreducible representation @xmath35 of su(3 ) .",
    "these eigenvalues are @xmath36 and @xmath37    our attempt to choose a form for @xmath27 is related to the present knowledge of confinement .",
    "lattice calculations are ambiguous about the static three - quark potentials in baryons .",
    "both y - shapes @xcite and @xmath1 shapes @xcite are supported .",
    "the difficulty to distinguish between them is due to the fact that the difference between the two gives at most 15 % in the dominant area law for the baryonic potential ( for a recent review see e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "note that these results concern color singlet states only while here we deal with both color singlet and octet states .",
    "potentials between static color sources in higher representations of su(3 ) , including the octet one , do also exist @xcite .",
    "they satisfy the so - called casimir scaling which means that potentials between sources in different representations are proportional to each other such as their ratios is given by the respective ratios of the eigenvalues of the corresponding ( quadratic ) casimir operators .",
    "on the other hand the scaling proportional to the number of fundamental flux tubes embedded into a higher representation coincides with the casimir scaling .",
    "in this situation we deemed reasonable to consider the working ansatz that @xmath27 has either a triangular shape @xmath38~,\\ ] ] or a y - shape @xmath39~,\\ ] ] with @xmath40 the point where the three flux tubes meet such as to satisfy the su@xmath7(3 ) gauge invariance ( see e.  g.  @xcite ) . taking @xmath41 and @xmath42 with a strength tension @xmath43 gev @xmath44 in ( [ delta ] ) , one recovers the linear confinement potential used in realistic consituent quark models as for example the model of ref .",
    "@xcite where the form ( [ delta ] ) is used in conjunction with a two - body color operator @xmath2 which brings the factor 1/2 in @xmath45 .",
    "taking @xmath41 and @xmath46 in ( [ y ] ) one recovers the confinement potential used for example in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite or @xcite where no color operator is present in the confinement part , thus one deals with colour singlets only . here",
    "we use the radial form ( [ delta ] ) or ( [ y ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ 3btotal ] ) , i.e. in conjunction with a three - body color operator . in our calculations",
    "the value of @xmath45 appearing both in ( [ delta ] ) and ( [ y ] ) is taken to be the same as in eq .",
    "( [ radial ] ) and the parameter @xmath47 thus represents the relative strength of the three - body versus the two - body force . by assuming the same triangular shape both in @xmath16 and @xmath17 analytic calculations can be carried for a while . in this way in ref .  @xcite it was found that @xmath47 must be located in the interval @xmath48",
    "the upper limit ensures that the lowest color singlet is below the lowest color octet state .",
    "the lower limit was required by the stability condition of the nucleon , @xmath49 . in ref .",
    "@xcite some arbitrariness was noticed for the lower bound because this is related to the choice of the color operator in ( [ v2b ] ) .",
    "however , as the numerical results of sec .",
    "iv will reveal , the above range of @xmath47 is entirely satisfactory for our discussion of the triangular shape , because the gap of between the colorless and color states will turn out to be large enough .",
    "in fact the common conclusion of @xcite and @xcite was that @xmath47 must be negative in order to obtain an increase in the gap between the color octet and singlet states in a @xmath0 system .",
    "therefore in the calculations below related to the triangular shape , we take @xmath50    the hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) was solved by using the faddeev approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , adequate for confining potentials .",
    "the necessary expectation values for the two - body color operator appearing in ( [ v2b ] ) are given in table [ twobody ] .",
    "the expectation values of the three - body color operator ( [ eq4 ] ) are taken from @xcite or @xcite .",
    "these are 10/9 , -5/36 and 1/9 for the singlet , octet and decuplet su(3 ) states , respectively .",
    "a particular advantage of the faddeev approach is that the incorporation of permutation symmetry is very easy . for identical quarks , as in this case , the three faddeev components of the three - quark wave function have the same functional form in their own jacobi coordinate systems .",
    "therefore the three equations can be reduced to a single one . from the structure of this equation",
    "it follows that the correct symmetry of the wave function under the exchange of any two particles is automatically guaranteed if the correct symmetry is implemented in one of the three components . in our calculation a bipolar harmonic basis was used , combined with spin , isospin and color basis states . if we select the basis states such as @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath15 and @xmath47 are the relative angular momentum , spin , isospin and color quantum numbers of a two - quark pair , the pauli principle for the three - quark system is satisfied .",
    "we have @xmath54 = 1 when @xmath55_c=[2]$ ] and @xmath54 = - 1 when @xmath55_c=[11]$ ] , where @xmath55_c$ ] is a given partition in the color space .",
    "if we denote the total angular momentum by @xmath56 and the total parity by @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the relative angular momentum of the third particle with respect to the pair , then the lowest color octets must have @xmath59 and the lowest decuplet @xmath60 . in table [ pauli ]",
    "we show the structure of the lowest color states with the corresponding quantum numbers of their components .",
    "this treatment of permutation symmetry as well as the whole numerical procedure were checked against the exact harmonic oscillator results of ref .",
    "as mentioned above , our purpose is to understand the implications of a three - body color confinement interaction in a realistic model .",
    "we look separately at its effect either due to the @xmath1-shape ( [ delta ] ) , or to the y - shape ( [ y ] ) .",
    "this shape is currently used in conjunction with a two - body @xmath2 color operator as an approximation to the y - shape @xcite .",
    "here we use it both in @xmath16 and @xmath17 as discussed above . then the contribution of the color part of @xmath16 and @xmath17 sum up together to @xmath61 ( i=1,8,10 ) as in eq .",
    "( 14 ) of ref .",
    "@xmath62    in fig .  1",
    "we show the dependence of some eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) as a function of @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "the case @xmath47 = 0 is the model @xcite for which we reproduced the ground state nucleon mass @xmath65=940 mev , and the resonance masses n(1440)1/2@xmath66= 1459 mev , n(1535)1/2@xmath67 = 1522 mev and n(1710)1/2@xmath66= 1783 mev . for @xmath68 the lowest color octets @xmath10 and @xmath69 acquire the masses 1536 mev and 1758 mev respectively and the @xmath10 color decuplet has 2077 mev .",
    "thus in a constituent quark model with three valence quarks the color states are so low that they can not be ignored . if the three - body interaction ( [ delta ] ) is switched on , the singlet states go substantially down and the color states go slightly up ( or down ) and a clear gap between the lowest color singlet s=1/2 , i=1/2 states and the color @xmath0 states emerges .",
    "this gap increases when @xmath47 is decreased .",
    "at @xmath70 it aquires a substantial value of more than 1500 mev .",
    "note however that the singlet states part of the spectrum shrinks and one has to bring it back close to the experimental spectrum .",
    "this can be achieved by a readjustment of the model parametres defined in ref",
    "in particular , in order to enlarge the distance between color singlet states one has to increase the strength tension @xmath45 in ( [ radial ] ) which will amount to an increase of the gap between the color and colorless states as well .",
    "it is then inferred that the gap will be large enough so that color states can safely be neglected .    before ending this subsection",
    "a word should be mentioned about the influence of the choice of the additional constant 7/3 in ( [ v2b ] ) on the results . as shown by dmitrasinovic @xcite the presence of this positive",
    "constant is crucial for the stability of a @xmath71 pair . in ref .",
    "@xcite some arbitrariness was noticed regarding this constant . in the @xmath0 spectrum , a change in the above additional constant amounts to a shift of the whole spectrum and some change in the slope of the confinement . if one wants to restore the spectrum to its initial form one has to change the arbitrary constant @xmath72 and the quantity @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ radial ] ) .",
    "for example , if the additional constant is increased , @xmath45 must be decreased . as a consequence the gap between the color and singlet states decreases . but this can be compensated by further decreasing the lower limit of @xmath47 below - 1.5 , which is allowed in the way discussed in @xcite .",
    "this is a genuine three - body force , both in the coordinate and the color space as well",
    ". then the color part contributions of @xmath16 and @xmath17 does not sum up analytically to @xmath61 as in eq .",
    "( [ chi ] ) , because the expectation value of the radial part of @xmath16 is different from that of @xmath17 .",
    "hence the numerical calculation of the entire spectrum is slightly more complicated .    in the y - shape ,",
    "the flux tubes meet at 120@xmath73 in order to ensure the minimum energy .",
    "if one of the interior angles of the flux - tube configuration is greater than 120@xmath73 the minimum energy condition can not be satisfied and the corresponding flux - tube collapses to a point which means that @xmath74= @xmath40 for @xmath15 = 1 , 2 or 3 .",
    "thus the y shape moves continuously into a two - legged flux - tube configuration , where the legs meet at an angle greater than 120@xmath73 .",
    "the geometrical arguments are clearly given in ref .",
    "@xcite for example .",
    "the spectrum associated to the y - shape ( [ y ] ) is presented in fig .  [ fig2 ] . in this case",
    "the lower limit on @xmath47 imposed by the inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) is no more valid but @xmath47 must remain negative .",
    "so we varied the parameter @xmath47 between zero and - 2 .",
    "at @xmath75 the spectrum is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the trend is similar to the @xmath1-shape case , but the mass of every colorless state vary more slowly with the strength @xmath76 of the three - body y - shape force . if one would rescale the @xmath76-axis by a factor 1/2 , the @xmath1 and the y - shape results would look closer to each other .",
    "to better understand the role of the three - body confinement force we also calculated the root - mean - square radii associated to the states of fig .",
    "these are displayed in fig .",
    "one can see that the quark core radii of the ground state nucleon and its lowest n(j=1/2 ) resonances increase slowly with @xmath76 .",
    "this is obviously the effect of the decrease of the confinement contribution through the addition of the three - body term . on the other hand ,",
    "the radii of the color states remain practicaly unchanged , similar to their energies .",
    "through the example of the goldstone boson exchange model  @xcite we have shown that the spectrum of a realistic constituent quark model with a pairwise color confinement operator and a linearly increasing behaviour can accomodate both singlet and color low - lying @xmath0 states .",
    "the lowest octet and decuplet color states appear in the middle of the observed spectrum which means they can not be ignored .",
    "in this situation there are two alternatives :    \\1 ) to keep simplicity . then , as shown here , the addition of a three - body confinement interaction can increase the gap between singlet and color states by 1 . 5 gev or more .",
    "then the color states can be neglected in calculations and the presently observed baryons can be described as pure @xmath0 states . to restore the quality of the spectrum one has to refit the parameters of the model , including the strength tension @xmath45 , which has to be increased in order to enlarge the spacing between colorless states .",
    "the increase of @xmath45 will lead to a further increase of the gap between the colorless and color states .",
    "\\2 ) if however the color states are maintained low in the spectrum of a hamiltonian with a pairwise confinement interaction only , one has to give up the simple @xmath0 picture of baryons .",
    "the color states could give rise to colorless hybrid baryons having singlet - singlet + octet - octet color components either of type @xmath77 or of type @xmath78 .",
    "in the context of a potential model based on a one - gluon exchange hyperfine interaction , applied to the study of tetraquarks i. e. @xmath79 systems , it has been shown @xcite that there is a strong mixing between states formed of two color singlet and two color octet @xmath80 pairs which leads to a substantial lowering of the variational energy .",
    "this should also be the case for hybrid baryons where singlet - singlet @xmath81 and octet - octet @xmath82 components could mix substantially .",
    "the present study suggests that such hybrids are to be expected in all partial waves if only two - body @xmath2 are considered .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite based on a two - body confinement and a schematic flavor and spin dependent hyperfine interaction model .",
    "the subject deserves a separate investigation inasmuch as the hybrid baryons raise a new interest @xcite .",
