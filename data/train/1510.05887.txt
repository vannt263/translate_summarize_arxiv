    "in recent years , the study of the harmonic oscillator problem in connection with the minimal length formalism has attracted the interest of theoretical physicists [ 1 - 16 ] .",
    "this minimal length may be described in a quantum system theoretically as a nonzero minimal uncertainty in position measurements .",
    "a major feature of this concept is that the physics below such a scale becomes inaccessible and then it defines a natural cut - off which prevents the usual uv divergences @xcite .",
    "this interesting subject has been studied within the frameworks of various branches of physics including string theory @xcite , quantum cosmology @xcite , black hole physics @xcite , general relativity @xcite and special relativity @xcite .    in 2002 , chang et al .",
    "@xcite illustrated how certain features of string theory may manifest themselves in simple quantum mechanical systems through the modification of the canonical commutation relation .",
    "recently , pedram @xcite presented the energy eigenvalues of a quantum bouncer in the framework of the generalized ( gravitational ) uncertainty principle ( gup ) via quantum mechanical and semiclassical schemes .",
    "he also used two equivalent nonperturbative representations of a deformed commutation relation in the form @xmath10=i\\hbar(1+\\eta p^2)$ ] , where @xmath11 is the gup parameter .",
    "this new representation is formally self - adjoint and preserves the ordinary nature of the position operator .",
    "he showed that both representations lead to the same modified semiclassical energy spectrum and agree well with the quantum mechanical description .",
    "very recently , the nikiforov - uvarov technique has been applied to solve the dirac equation in minimal length quantum mechanics @xcite .    using the formula method for bound state problems @xcite in the present work",
    ", we determine the solutions for fermionic massive spin @xmath12 particles , interacting with a harmonic oscillator , where the coordinates and momenta are assumed to obey the commutation relation @xmath0=i\\hbar\\left(1+\\eta p^2\\right)$ ] .",
    "furthermore , we obtain the nonrelativistic limit of our solution and then proceed to the construction of the creation and annihilation operators for harmonic oscillator with minimal length uncertainty relation .",
    "the heisenberg algebra we need to study , can be obtained when the commutation relation between the position and momentum is modified from the canonical one to @xcite @xmath13=i\\hbar\\left(1+\\eta p^2\\right ) , \\label{ee1}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is an extremely small positive deformation parameter . according to this algebra , which implements the minimal length",
    ", we have the deformed uncertainty relation , which appears in perturbative string theory as @xmath14 } , \\label{ee2}\\ ] ] and this implies the existence of a minimal length @xmath15    we denote the position and momentum operators obeying equation ( [ ee1 ] ) in momentum space by @xcite @xmath16,\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\hat{p}=p . \\label{ee4}\\ ] ] here @xmath17 is an arbitrary constant , which does not appear in the commutation relation ( 1 ) , and does not affect the relativistic energy spectrum we derive , but only the weight function in the scalar product in the momentum space @xcite @xmath18^{1-\\alpha}}\\xi'^*(p)\\xi(p ) , \\label{ee5}\\ ] ] with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "now , consider the dirac equation of a particle with mass @xmath21 moving under the influence of multi - scalar @xmath22 and @xmath23 potentials as @xmath24\\right\\}\\psi_n(p)=\\left[e_r - v(\\hat{x})\\right]\\psi_n(p ) } , \\label{ee6}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the relativistic energy of the system , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are @xmath28 dirac matrices defined by @xmath29 taking the spinor eigenfunctions as @xmath30 and substituting them into equation ( [ ee6 ] ) , we find the following two - coupled equations    @xmath31    further solving equations ( [ ee9a ] ) and ( [ ee9b ] ) simultaneously and making use of the formula @xmath32 we can eliminate @xmath33 and then obtain @xmath34 for the case of an equal multi - scalar potential , we obtain the following wave equation produces a nontrivial nonrelativistic limit with a potential function @xmath35 , and not @xmath36 . accordingly , it would be natural to scale the potential terms in equation ( [ ee9a ] ) and equation ( [ ee9b ] ) so that in the nonrelativistic limit the interaction potential becomes @xmath23 , not @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "thus , these modifications have been made in equation ( [ ee12 ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath38 now inserting the harmonic oscillator potential , @xmath39 into equation ( [ ee12 ] ) we get @xmath40 furthermore , substituting operator ( [ ee4 ] ) into equation ( [ ee13 ] ) and using @xmath41\\ ] ] as well as defining the following two parameters @xmath42 we finally obtain @xmath43 we employ the formula method ( fm ) to solve equation ( [ ee16 ] ) . the fm has been introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and has been used in some physical systems to obtain the whole spectra in a very simple way .",
    "here we proceed with its application to relativistic equations in minimal length quantum mechanics .",
    "we give a brief review of this method and all formulas required for our calculation in the next section .",
    "one of the calculational tools utilized in solving the schrdinger - like equation including the centrifugal barrier and/or the spin - orbit coupling term is the so called fm . for a given potential",
    "the idea is to convert the schrdinger - like wave equation into the standard form given by equation ( 1 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. @xmath44 via an appropriate coordinate transformation of the form @xmath45 .",
    "the prime represents the first derivative with respect to the argument @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are parameters .",
    "then , the energy eigenvalues and the corresponding wave functions can be obtained if the problem is exactly solvable .",
    "we use the following formulas    @xmath48 ^ 2}{2\\left[\\frac{1 - 2n}{2}-\\frac{1}{2k_3}\\left(k_2-\\sqrt{(k_3-k_2)^2 - 4a}\\right)\\right]}\\right]^2-k_5 ^ 2=0 , k_{3 } \\neq 0 \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{and } \\label{ee18a}\\\\[2 mm ] & & \\psi_n(s)=n_ns^{k_4}(1-k_3s)^{k_5}\\ _",

    "in order to solve equation ( [ ee16 ] ) by the fm , we introduce a new transformation of the form @xmath51 with the interval @xmath52 , which maintains the finiteness of the transformed wave functions on the boundaries .",
    "thus , we find @xmath53 furthermore , we perform a substitution @xmath54 which maps the region @xmath55 to @xmath56 . in that case ,",
    "equation ( [ ee20 ] ) can be transformed into @xmath57 now , let us transform this equation to the form of equation ( [ ee17 ] ) . to this end , we introduce another transformation of the form @xmath58 to obtain @xmath59 since equation ( [ ee22 ] ) is now suitable for an fm solution , we compare it with equation ( [ ee17 ] ) and thus , we can determine the parameters @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) where @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . also , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . furthermore , by means of equation ( [ ee19 ] ) , we can derive @xmath67 and @xmath68 as follows : @xmath69 using the equation ( [ ee18a ] ) which can be rewritten as @xmath70 leads to the following relativistic energy spectrum with minimal length uncertainty relation @xmath71 or @xmath72 .",

    "we see that the momentum - space wave function can also be expressed in terms of gegenbauer polynomials @xmath77 .",
    "now , let us take the nonrelativistic limit of our solution .",
    "de souza dutra et al .",
    "@xcite found that there is a possibility of obtaining approximate nonrelativistic ( nr ) solution from relativistic ones .",
    "very recently , sun @xcite proposed a meaningful approach for deriving the bound state solutions of nr schrdinger equation ( se ) from the bound state of relativistic equations .",
    "the essence of this approach is that , in the nr limit , the se may be derived from the relativistic one when the energies of the two potentials @xmath78 and @xmath79 are small compared to the rest energy @xmath80 , then the nr energy approximated as @xmath81 and the nr wave function is @xmath82 .",
    "that is , nr energies , @xmath83 can be determined by taking nr limit values of the relativistic eigenenergies @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , we can write @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the reduced mass in a nr case @xcite . consequently , the nr energy spectrum becomes @xmath87 } \\label{ee31}\\ ] ] and the momentum - space wave function @xmath88 which essentially coincide with the ones obtained previously via the functional analysis approach @xcite .",
    "before we end this work , we shall identify the creation and annihilation operators for the wavefunctions via the factorization method .    . for principal quantum numbers @xmath89 , ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 )",

    "we study the problem of finding the creation and annihilation operators for the position - space wave function which we can obtain by equation ( [ ee32 ] ) via the fm .",
    "as shown in previous works [ 30 - 38 ] , the ladder operators can be constructed directly from the wave function by considering the recursion relations of the special functions and then constructing an appropriate lie algebra in terms of these ladder operators without introducing any auxiliary variable .",
    "therefore , we search for differential operators @xmath94 satisfying the property @xmath95 specifically , these operators are in the form @xmath96 which depends only on the physical variable @xmath97 .",
    "the calculation in this section is impossible without calculating the normalization constant @xmath98 . for this purpose ,",
