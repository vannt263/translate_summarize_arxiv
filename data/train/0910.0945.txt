    "sub - riemannian geometry is proved to play an important role in many applications , e.g. , in mathematical physics and control theory .",
    "sub - riemannian geometry enjoys major differences from the riemannian being a generalization of the latter at the same time , e.g. , geodesics may be singular , the hausdorff dimension is larger than the manifold topological dimension , the exponential map is never a local diffeomorphism . there exists a large amount of literature developing sub - riemannian geometry .",
    "typical general references are @xcite .",
    "the sub - lorentzian case is less studied and the first works in this directions appeared rather recenlty , see @xcite .    in the development of sub - riemannian geometry ,",
    "one observes several examples , which are mainly nilpotent lie groups , with either a left or right invariant distribution and metric .",
    "a sample representative is the heisenberg group ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "analysis of these groups in the sub - riemannian setting , is already well studied .",
    "while these groups enjoy the advantage that explicit results are easier to obtain , their properties are sometimes too nice to be good examples to reveal all specific features of sub - riemannian geometry in its generality . for instance , the cut locus and the conjugate loci for the heisenberg group globally coincide .",
    "a natural next step after considering nilpotent groups is to consider semisimple lie groups .",
    "let @xmath2 be such a group with the lie algebra @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 be the cartan involution sending an element @xmath5 from the lie algebra to minus its conjugate transpose .",
    "then there is a splitting @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the @xmath9 and @xmath10 eigenspaces of @xmath11 .",
    "remember that the killing form @xmath12 is non - degenerate when @xmath3 is semisimple . if @xmath2 is compact ( or more generally , if @xmath13 is compact , where @xmath14 denotes the center of @xmath2 ) , then @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , is positive definite on @xmath3 .",
    "so , we can use this to define a bi - invariant riemannian metric on @xmath2 .",
    "the restriction of this metric to a distribution on @xmath2 gives a sub - riemannian manifold .",
    "an example of such a manifold , namely @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 considered as unit quaternions ) , was considered in @xcite .",
    "the problem of geodesic connectivity on @xmath18 was addressed in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath2 is non - compact and @xmath19 ( i.e. , @xmath13 is non - compact ) , then the killing form restricted to @xmath8 is positive definite .",
    "we consider a left translation of @xmath8 as our horizontal distribution , and using the metric induced by the killing form , we obtain a sub - riemannian manifold equipped with a bi - invariant metric .",
    "let @xmath20 be a subgroup of @xmath2 with the lie algebra @xmath7 .",
    "then @xmath2 is diffeomorphic to @xmath21 , by @xmath22 , and if @xmath2 has a finite center , then @xmath20 is a maximal compact subgroup .",
    "in addition , the above mentioned distribution is horizontal with respect to the quotient map @xmath23 it follows that all normal geodesics are liftings of geodesics from @xmath24 , hence they are of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the initial point .    here",
    "we consider an example with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "although non - holonomic geometry on @xmath0 ( or the isometric case of @xmath29 ) was first considered earlier in , e.g. , @xcite , we will obtain new results and a more complete description of geodesics both in sub - riemannian and sub - lorentzian settings .",
    "much of all meaningful results come from the analysis of the universal cover of @xmath0 , which we denote by @xmath1 , and which is of its own interest as a new representative of a non - nilpotent lie group over the topological space @xmath30 .",
    "we remark also that the khler manifold @xmath31 , is of particular importance in quantum field theories describing a black hole in two - dimensional spacetime by means of an @xmath31-gauged wess - zumino - novikov - witten model , see e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath32 be the lie algebra of @xmath0 .",
    "when considered as a bilinear form on the entire @xmath32 , the killing form is an index 1 pseudo - metric .",
    "furthermore , the induced lorentzian metric on the lie group makes @xmath0 isometric to what is called the anti - de sitter space @xmath33 in general relativity .",
    "this makes it tempting to study sub - lorentzian geometry on @xmath0 .",
    "apart from the fact that the hamiltonian approach was proposed in @xcite to study sub - lorentzian structures on @xmath0 , the authors are not aware of other concrete examples so far , where sub - lorentzian geometry is studied on any other manifold different from the heisenberg group @xcite or an extension of it to a @xmath34-type carnot group @xcite .",
    "the notion of distance in sub - lorentzian geometry , as well as in lorentzian geometry , is given by the supremum of length over timelike curves .",
    "since timelike loops may appear in @xmath0 , the distance function behaves badly ( more specifically the distance from a point to itself is @xmath35 ) .",
    "therefore , sub - lorentzian geometry on @xmath1 is more interesting and meaningful than on @xmath0 .",
    "we are also interested in comparison of sub - lorentzian and lorentzian geometries on @xmath1 , to try to understand somewhat more how the geometry changes when the lorentzian metric is restricted to a distribution .",
    "the strong interplay between @xmath1 and @xmath0 will , however , be practical for all explicit calculations .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to general definitions and relations between sub - riemannian and sub - lorentzian geometry , and optimal control .",
    "section 3 describes the lie groups @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "section 4 contains results concerning sub - riemannnian geometry .",
    "we describe the number of geodesics connecting two points and give explicit formulas for the distance functions .",
    "the cut and conjugate loci on both lie groups are given .",
    "we discuss the connection between the conjugate locus and the behavior of the geodesics . in section 5",
    ", we completely describe the two - point connectivity problem by sub - lorentzian geodesics , and compare it with the lorentzian case .",
    "the lorentzian and sub - lorentzian future for @xmath1 are compared .",
    "it turns out that the reachable sets for lorentzian and sub - lorentzian normal geodesics intersect but are not included one to the other .",
    "section 6 contains the proofs of main results .",
