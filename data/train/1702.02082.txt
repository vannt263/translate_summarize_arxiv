    "optical quantum information processing can be classified mainly into two approaches depending on encoding of quantum information : one is based on continuous electric field quadratures ( thus , referred to as continuous - variable quantum information ) , and the other is based on discrete photon numbers ( discrete - variable quantum information ) .",
    "each of the approaches has its own advantages compared with the other : e.g. , in the continuous - variable approach , highly multimode entangled states can be deterministically generated  @xcite , and in the discrete - variable approach , quantum processes that can not be classically simulated can be implemented  @xcite . therefore , a new approach to combine both advantages has attracted much attention , which is called hybrid quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental operations for the hybrid approach is single - photon subtraction , mathematically described by the annihilation operator @xmath0 .",
    "it introduces a non - gaussian characteristic ( i.e. negativity of wigner function ) in continuous - variable quantum information  @xcite , which plays essential roles in various quantum information processing , e.g. , universal  @xcite and genuine  @xcite quantum computing , preparation of coherent - state - superposition  @xcite and hybrid entanglement  @xcite , noiseless linear amplification  @xcite , and entanglement concentration  @xcite .",
    "the conventional way of implementing the single - photon subtraction is to detect a single photon tapped from an input light using a low - reflectance beam splitter  @xcite .",
    "such a method works well for a single - mode state  @xcite , but it is unsuitable for a multimode state because the detected photon comes from any mode in an incoherent way , which results in a complete mixture of annihilation operators over the multiple modes  @xcite . to fully benefit from the highly multimode",
    "entangled states available in the continuous variable approach  @xcite , one accordingly requires a single - photon subtraction that is able to operate only in the desired modes by maintaining their mode coherence  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we implement and characterize a single - photon subtractor which can be tuned to subtract a single photon exclusively from one desired time - frequency mode of light or coherently from multiple time - frequency modes .",
    "the single - photon subtractor is based on the detection of a single photon generated via a sum frequency interaction between an input beam and a strong gate beam in which the choice of the gate - beam modes determines the time - frequency modes of single - photon subtraction  @xcite . to characterize single - photon subtractions with various choices of the gate beam modes",
    ", we measure the _ subtraction matrix _ of each single - photon subtraction by employing coherent - state quantum process tomography  @xcite : the subtraction matrix contains complete information about a general single - photon subtraction ( i.e. amplitude , phase , and coherence between different modes ) , and can be used to quantify its performances .",

    "on the other hand , single - photon subtraction can be diverse because it can consist of , for example , one annihilation operator from multiple modes or several annihilation operators from multiple modes , added as a superposition or as a mixture .",

    "this fact implies that one can get enough information about single - photon subtraction by measuring only the success probability without measuring the output state . when a coherent state @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the normalized amplitude ( @xmath40 ) for @xmath41-th mode , and @xmath42 is the average photon number in the entire modes , is used as an input state of single - photon subtraction in eq .",
