    "quasiparticle tunneling through narrow constrictions or point contacts that bring counter - propagating edges close could serve as a powerful tool to probe both the bulk topological order as well as edge properties of fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) liquids  @xcite .",
    "in particular , interference signatures from double point contact devices may reveal the statistical properties of the quasiparticles that tunnel through them  @xcite , especially the non - abelian ones  @xcite . in recent interference experiments at the @xmath2 fqh state  @xcite ,",
    "willett _ et al .",
    "_ found that quasiparticles with charge @xmath3 and @xmath4 both contribute to the interference patterns and dominate in different regimes , which was anticipated in earlier theoretical work@xcite . to have a complete understanding of these experiments",
    ", one needs quantitative information on the relative importance of quasiparticles with different charges .",
    "motivated by this , four of the authors and a co - worker  @xcite performed microscopic calculations of the tunneling matrix elements of various types of quasiparticles , for both the abelian laughlin state , and the non - abelian moore - read ( mr ) state .",
    "the focus of the previous work was the dependence of these matrix elements on the tunneling distance : the main result was that the ratio between tunneling matrix elements for quasiparticles with different charges decays with tunneling distance in a gaussian form , which originates from their charge difference .",
    "such considerations and results are required for a complete understanding of the non - abelian interferometer  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the system size dependence of the tunneling matrix elements is also an interesting issue . in microscopic studies ,",
    "we start from interacting electrons with fermionic statistics . with proper choices of microscopic hamiltonian ,",
    "ground states with nontrivial topological properties emerge , together with fractionally charged quasiparticle excitations , which may obey either abelian or non - abelian statistics .",
    "naturally , in a calculation relevant to quasiparticle tunneling amplitude we can read out the information of the scaling dimension of the corresponding tunneling operator .",
    "in particular , the finite system size cutoff in the numerical calculations may introduce scaling behavior in the tunneling amplitude with an exponent imprinted with the quasiparticle conformal dimension .    in the present paper",
    "we study the system size dependence of these matrix elements in the laughlin and the moore - read states . by combining numerical calculations with effective field theory analysis",
    ", we show that their size dependence takes power - law forms with exponents related to the scaling dimensions of the corresponding quasiparticle operators .",
    "furthermore , in the limit when the annulus deforms continuously into a quasi - one - dimensional ring , we conjecture the precise functional forms of the size dependence , which is not only consistent with the expected power - law form in the scaling limit , but also verified to be true in finite - size systems ( using the exact jack polynomial approach , rather than the lanczos diagonalization with controllable error ) , indicating their exactness .",
    "we also attempt to extend the discussions to the read - rezayi states .",
    "we review our model and earlier results in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fieldtheory ] we formulate a scaling theory for the tunneling amplitude of abelian quasiparticles and compare it with numerical scaling results .",
    "we then conjecture closed - form expressions for the tunneling amplitude , from which we extract exact scaling exponents in sec .",
    "[ sec : conjecture ] .",
    "we discuss the scaling behavior for the charge-@xmath3 non - abelian quasihole in the moore - read state in sec .",
    "[ sec : nonabelian ] and generalize the discussion to the read - rezayi states in sec .  [ sec : readrezayi ] .",
    "we summarize in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in the plane ( disc ) geometry we consider an fqh droplet at various filling fractions , which correspond to the series of the laughlin states , the moore - read state , and the read - rezayi parafermion states .",
    "we generate various abelian and non - abelian quasiparticles at the center of the droplet .",
    "we assume a single - particle tunneling potential @xmath5 which breaks the rotational symmetry .",
    "for the many - body states with @xmath6 electrons , we write the tunneling operator as the sum of the single - particle operators , @xmath7 we compute the bulk - to - edge tunneling amplitude @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the fqh ground states with and without a quasihole ( at the disc center ) , respectively . for convenience",
    ", we will henceforth set @xmath11 as the unit of the tunneling amplitudes . as seen in the earlier work  @xcite ,",
    "the matrix elements consist of contributions from the respective slater - determinant components @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14s and @xmath1s are the angular momenta of the occupied orbitals .",
    "a non - zero contribution only enters when @xmath15 and @xmath16 are identical except for a single pair @xmath17 and @xmath18 with the corresponding angular momentum difference .",
    "more details are available in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to be more relevant to the experimental situations in which quasiparticles tunnel between two edges , we study the edge - to - edge tunneling by inserting @xmath19 laughlin quasiholes into the center of the droplet  @xcite .",
    "this transforms a wavefunction @xmath20 to @xmath21 , so that each component slater determinant becomes a new one , picking up a new normalization factor .",
    "the first @xmath19 orbitals from the center are now completely empty and the electrons are occupying orbitals above @xmath19 , effectively producing an fqh droplet on an annulus .",
    "the tunneling distance @xmath22 between the inner and outer edges decreases monotonically under this transformation .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath23 is defined as the edge - to - edge tunneling amplitude .",
    "the earlier work  @xcite found that the tunneling amplitude ratio of quasiparticles with different charges decays with a gaussian tail as the interedge distance increases .",
    "the characteristic length scale associated with this dependence originates partially from the difference in the corresponding quasiparticle charges . in the moore - read state , for example",
    ", the tunneling amplitude for a charge @xmath3 quasiparticle is larger than that for a charge @xmath4 quasiparticle  @xcite .",
    "our analyses  @xcite also show intriguing size dependence in the tunneling amplitudes for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 quasiholes , although their ratio appears to be size independent in the annulus geometry .",
    "these observations motivated us to extend the study on the size dependence of @xmath23 for different types of quasiholes in the read - rezayi series of fqh states , which include laughlin and moore - read states as special members .",
    "we note that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : electrontunneling ] ) we introduced the bare tunneling potential for _ electrons _ , which form fractional quantum hall liquids .",
    "our results represent the tunneling amplitudes for _ quasiparticles _ ( not for electrons ) and have therefore taken into account the many - body correlations of the system .",
    "but for quasiparticles , when treated as elementary excitations of the system , these are bare tunneling amplitudes at the microscopic length and energy scales .",
    "they are subject to further renormalization when effective low - energy theories are constructed by integrating out degrees of freedom at higher - energy and shorter length scales .",
    "we start with a field theoretical analysis of the quasiparticle tunneling amplitude , which illustrates our calculation and provides an expectation on the results .",
    "we consider , for illustration , a system of electrons and quasiparticles on a cylinder with circumference @xmath24 and edge - to - edge distance @xmath25 .",
    "this geometry is equivalent to an annulus with an edge - to - edge distance much smaller than the radius . for fixed @xmath26 , the system size @xmath27 .",
    "we assume that the edge runs around the @xmath28 direction , while tunneling occurs along the @xmath29 direction at @xmath30 .",
    "we introduce quasiparticle operators @xmath31 , with @xmath32 corresponding to the two edges , while @xmath33 is quasiparticle type , and normalize @xmath34 ( at each edge ) such that the equal time green s function satisfies @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the conformal dimension of @xmath37 , and proper factors of microscopic length scale @xmath38 are implied to ensure the correct dimensionality of all quantities .    in a low - energy effective theory",

    "we include a prefactor @xmath24the jacobian when transforming @xmath41 on the annulus to @xmath42 on the cylinder .",
    "a state generated by tunneling a quasiparticle from one edge to another takes the following form ( which is a momentum eigenstate ) : @xmath43 it is easy to show using eq .",
    "( [ eq : qpgreen ] ) that the normalization factor @xmath44 for @xmath45 in which case the corresponding quasiparticle tunneling operator is relevant in the renormalization group ( rg ) sense@xcite .",
    "we define the bare quasiparticle tunneling matrix element @xmath46 where we used the properties ( [ eq : qpgreen ] ) and ( [ eq : relevance ] ) and @xmath47 encodes @xmath26-dependence of @xmath40 , which is expected to be dominated by the landau level gaussian factor@xcite .",
    "this scaling behavior is expected for `` elementary '' abelian quasiholes of the laughlin type , e.g. , the charge-@xmath48 quasiholes in the @xmath49 laughlin state , as well as for the charge-@xmath4 quasihole ( in the identity sector ) in the @xmath50 moore - read state .",

    "the dashed line attempts to fit the exponent to a linear dependence on the conformal dimensions of the charge and neutral components [ eq .  ( [ eq : fit])].,width=453 ]",
    "in summary , we find that the tunneling amplitude for abelian quasiparticles exhibits finite - size scaling behavior with an exponent related to the conformal dimension of the quasiparticles , irrespective of whether their inter - edge tunneling is relevant or not .",
    "this is true for abelian quasiparticles in both abelian and non - abelian quantum hall states .",
    "generically , we find that in our model the inter - edge tunneling amplitude for an ideal quasiparticle ( arising from the variational wavefunctions ) with charge @xmath68 and a conformal dimension of @xmath69 can be expressed as @xmath70 where @xmath71 for an abelian quasiparticle with charge component only , e.g. , @xmath72 for the charge @xmath4 abelian quasihole in the moore - read state .",
    "we note that @xmath73 is related to the propagation of charge bosons and neutral ( para)fermions perpendicular to the edges , which contain additional dependency on @xmath26 as observed for @xmath74 .",
    "the observation of the scaling behavior suggests that the systems are described by underlying conformal field theories ; in fact , the conformal dimensions of the abelian quasiholes obtained from the tunneling amplitudes are in perfect agreement with those in the @xmath75 parafermion theories for quantum hall wavefunctions , based on which we can deduce the conformal dimensions of non - abelian quasiholes . computing",
    "the conformal dimensions of quasiparticles from wavefunctions has also been attempted in the pattern of zeros classification  @xcite and in the jack polynomial approach  @xcite .",
    "the scaling behavior can be alternatively expressed by a differential equation @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 . here",
    "we fix the edge - to - edge distance @xmath26 and the filling fraction @xmath79 so the number of electrons @xmath80 , where @xmath24 is the length of the edge ; in the large @xmath6 limit the annulus is thin so we do not need to distinguish the lengths of the inner and outer edges .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : rg ] ) resembles the renormalization group flow equation in the context of edge state transport  @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath81 for the quasiparticles with charge @xmath55 is negative , which reflects that the quasiparticles are irrelevant to inter - edge tunneling .    for the charge-@xmath3 non - abelian quasihole in the moore - read state , we find @xmath82 ( not 3/4 ) and we speculate that the contributions from the charge and neutral components are asymmetric .",
    "interestingly , the scaling exponent coincides with that of the charge-@xmath4 abelian quasiparticle and therefore we obtain perfect data collapse in fig .  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite for different @xmath6 .",
    "generically , in the non - abelian quasiparticle tunneling amplitudes for the read - rezayi @xmath75 parafermion states , we find anomalous scaling behavior ( hence the signature of non - abelian statistics in model simulations ) beyond simple scaling analysis .",
