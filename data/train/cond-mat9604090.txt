    "the explicit solution of the model of one - dimensional interacting electron gas @xcite ( luttinger liquid ) allowed to describe analytically the gap in the tunnel density of states for the region of energies close to the fermi level .",
    "the physical origin of the gap is that , in order to add an electron to the interacting system , a shift , vacating an extra space , should be created .",
    "then the gap reveals the smallness of the overlap of many ",
    "electron wave functions with and without such a shift .",
    "the bosonization transformation @xcite permits one to present the formation of the shift as a creation of plasmon modes in the system .",
    "the fact that the dispersion law of plasmons is linear in one dimension : @xmath0 , results in a power  law behavior of the density of states @xmath1 .",
    "for tunneling into the edge of a single  channel liquid the density of states has a form @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the fermi velocity .",
    "matveev an glazman @xcite have traced the evolution of the exponent in ( [ sv ] ) with increasing number of channels .",
    "bosonization procedure can be generically extended to the the case of longitudinally inhomogeneous luttinger liquid .",
    "if the spacial scale of inhomogeniety is much larger than the fermi wave length , @xmath4 , it can be considered as a `` scattering potential '' for the plasmon modes , so that a plasmon gets partially reflected after propagation through the region of inhomogeniety .",
    "if the boundaries of this region are abrupt compared to the wave length of a plasmon ( but smooth on the scale of @xmath4 ) , the reflection coefficient , as a function of frequency , exhibits the interference oscillations .",
    "such oscillations were first considered in ref . . in ref .",
    "it was demonstrated that the oscillations of the reflection coefficient lead to the oscillating structure in the density of states , superimposed on the power  law increase .    in the present paper",
    "we consider another realization of inhomogeniety .",
    "namely , we assume that the density of the luttinger liquid is periodically modulated with a period @xmath5 .",
    "we show that such a modulation results in additional singularity in the tunnel density of states .",
    "the origin of the singularity is a gap in the plasmon spectrum , which opens due to the periodic modulation . in complete analogy with motion of an electron in a periodic potential , the position of the center of the gap , @xmath6 ,",
    "is determined by the condition @xmath7 , so that @xmath8 .",
    "we assume the modulation to be weak .",
    "then the width of the gap , @xmath9 , is much smaller than @xmath6 , the ratio @xmath10 being proportional to the relative amplitude of the modulation .",
    "it is also proportional to the interaction strength , since it is obvious that without interaction the gap is absent . in the vicinity of @xmath6 the modulation  induced correction to the tunnel density of states , @xmath11 , is a function of @xmath12 . for @xmath13",
    ", @xmath14 behaves as a power law with the same exponent as in ( [ sv ] ) .",
    "since we study the tunneling into the edge , the actual shape of @xmath14 appears to depend strongly on the _ phase _ of the modulation .",
    "this is because for plasmons with frequencies close to @xmath6 the behavior of the field near the edge is determined by this phase .",
    "the other reason is that , with periodic modulation , the presence of an edge leads to the formation of a localized plasmon mode with frequency within the gap . for an electron in a periodic potential",
    "this fact was established more than 60 years ago @xcite . the frequency of the localized mode sweaps through the gap as the phase of modulation changes .",
    "we show that the localized plasmon provides a contribution to @xmath14 comparable to that from the extended modes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section the form of the hamiltonian for an inhomogeneous luttinger liquid is established . in sect .",
    "iii we derive a general formula for inhomogeneity  induced correction to the tunnel density of states . in sect .",
    "iv the plasmon modes for the case of a weak sinusoidal modulation of the electron concentration are found .",
    "the results for @xmath15 are analyzed in sect .",
    "v. section vi concludes the paper .",
    "in this section we will establish the form of the hamiltonian for the luttinger liquid with spatially varying concentration of electrons @xmath16 .",
    "we start from the classical equation of motion @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the electron mass ; @xmath19 is the displacement ; @xmath20 is the electron density : @xmath21 , with @xmath22 describing the temporal fluctuations ; @xmath23 is the actual electric field consisting of static and fluctuating parts ; @xmath24 is the hydrostatic pressure .",
    "the static electric field can be eliminated from eq .",
    "( 1 ) using the equilibrium condition @xmath25 which gives @xmath26 . substituting this value into ( 1 ) and linearizing ( 1 ) with respect to @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , we obtain @xmath30    let @xmath31 be the potential of electron  electron interactions , screened by the presence of a gate electrode . then @xmath28 can be presented as a field created by the density fluctuations @xmath32 @xmath33 as usually we will assume that the screening radius is much smaller than the characteristic spatial scale of the fluctuations",
