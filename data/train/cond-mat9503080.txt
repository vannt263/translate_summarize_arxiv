    "effects of single - charge tunneling in ultrasmall capacitance junctions has become of much experimental and theoretical interest . for a review see for instance ref .  .",

    "we develop a nonlinear response approach to the cooper pair tunneling in voltage biased ultrasmall sis junctions basing on the elementary tunneling hamiltonian for quasiparticles .",
    "since this hamiltonian describes only the tunneling of single quasiparticles ( 1e ) the cooper pair tunneling ( 2e ) corresponds in perturbation theory to a process of higher order . in leading order this approach yields the known result of quasiparticle tunneling @xcite . because of the voltage biasing and due to eq .",
    "( [ ineq1 ] ) the ordinary josephson current which is also an effect of first order perturbation theory does not play any role .",
    "the current - voltage characteristic of small tunnel junctions is essentially influenced by the external circuit .",
    "this electromagnetic environment is able to absorb energy which is for superconducting electrodes at zero temperature the only possibility to transfer the energy gain of the tunneling process . because cooper pairs live in the condensate they can not absorb this energy . to simplify matters",
    "we restrict ourselves to the limiting cases of low- and high - resistance environments ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) at @xmath0 where the quasiparticle currents are suppressed for voltages lower than the thresholds @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "@xmath8 is the quantum resistance and @xmath9 labels the superconducting energy gap .",
    "the additional part @xmath10 corresponds to the coulomb energy . for single junctions",
    "is known that the coulomb blockade can only be observed if the junction is sufficiently decoupled from the voltage bias by a high - resistance environment . beyond the thresholds cooper pairs",
    "can break up into quasiparticles and the tunnel current is carried mainly by quasiparticles .",
    "cooper pair tunneling is described in literature by using the model of an effective hamiltonian @xcite with the perturbation term @xmath11 where the operator @xmath12 changes the macroscopic charge @xmath13 on the junction by the value @xmath14 corresponding to the charge of a cooper pair .",
    "this means that simultaneously tunneling of two electrons ( cooper pair ) is introduced by hand .",
    "then the calculated supercurrent reads @xcite @xmath15 with @xmath16 the function @xmath17 contains the information about the structure of the environment ( @xmath18 ) @xcite @xmath19-i\\sin\\omega\\tau\\right\\}\\mbox{d}\\omega\\ ; , \\label{jf1}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 .",

    "the definition of @xmath36 differs from that of @xmath37 ( eq . ( [ pf1 ] ) ) by the lack of the factor 4 in front of the function @xmath17 . the dependence of the supercurrent on the factor @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ sc1 ] ) indicates that the supercurrent has something to do with the squared josephson current amplitude @xmath39 .",
    "this is motivation to express the supercurrent @xmath3 by means of a perturbation theory of higher order in the elementary tunneling hamiltonian @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 stand for quasiparticle annihilation operators of the left and right electrode satisfying anticommutation relations .",
    "the spin is labeled by the subscript @xmath43 .    in this way the special features of cooper pair tunneling ( transfer of charges 2e , energy transfer only to the environment ) arise automatically . in other words",
    "we do not consider tunneling particles with charge @xmath44 from the beginning .",
    "rather than we start with elementary particles ( electrons ) with charge @xmath45 and the supercurrent arises as an effect of higher order .",

    "the reason is the following .",
    "the separation of the voltage dependence in the correlation functions ( @xmath71 ) without signature zero ( e.g. @xmath72 ) leads to expressions containing time dependent ( @xmath73 ) terms .",
    "furthermore , a phase @xmath74 remains indeterminated additionally .",
    "this corresponds to common josephson physics where one has contributions proportional to @xmath75 and @xmath76@xcite .",
    "however , in josephson physics the phase @xmath74 is defined by current biasing . therefore",

    "( [ alg1 ] ) and using new time variables @xmath77 eq .",

    "the operators @xmath82 in the interaction representation can be written as @xmath83 where the operators @xmath84 carry only the time dependence with respect to the electrodes and the phase dependend operators @xmath85 carry those with respect to the environment .",
    "for instance the function @xmath79 reads therefore @xmath86 these other terms arise due to the resolution of the interlaced commutators .",
    "the decisive step of the identification of the contributions which describe cooper pair tunneling is to reduce the 4-correlators with respect to @xmath87 into 2-correlators containing only operators with the same signature , namely @xmath88 this decomposition guarantees that only condensate states corresponding to cooper pairs are taken into account .",
    "one can prove this from the point of view of the elementary operators @xmath89 and @xmath89 .",
    "then the decomposition is equivalent to @xmath90 and one can see that on both banks of the junction only the condensate properties contribute .",
    "the terms which have been neglected in this decomposition belong to quasiparticle tunneling of higher order and processes including both quasiparticles and cooper pairs .",
    "the correlators @xmath91 can be expressed by the current amplitude @xmath92 in the following way @xcite @xmath93 note the symmetry @xmath94 .",
    "the phase correlations can also be calculated , for instance by generalizing the method presented in ref .  .",

    "concerning the structure of the current let us concentrate on the case of a high - resistance environment ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "the opposite case of a low - resistance environment corresponds to the condition @xmath112 .",
    "one can make the following remarks :    * the current is an antisymmetric function of the applied voltage which reflects the expectation that a reversed voltage leads to a reversed current . *",
    "the current shows a @xmath113-like singularity at @xmath114 corresponding to the fact that the energy @xmath115 connected with the tunneling of a cooper pair has to be transferred to the environment . because cooper pairs live in the condensate they can not absorb this energy .",
    "of course , this singular expression will be smoothed both due to finite temperatures and finite environment resistances .",
    "* there is an additional current contribution which is proportional to @xmath116 . because of eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) and of the known structure of @xmath117 in standard bcs theory ( @xmath118)@xcite @xmath119 this current contribution only exists if @xmath120 or @xmath121 which is just the condition for the onset of the quasiparticle current . since our approach is based on higher order perturbation theory we are only interested in effects which occur in the gap region of quasiparticle tunneling . therefore , only the first term of eq .",
    "( [ sc6 ] ) has to be considered .",
    "the integral in the first term of eq .",
    "( [ sc6 ] ) reminds of the definition of @xmath122 according to the kramers - kronig relation .",

    "nevertheless , it is reasonable to discuss the case @xmath123 corresponding to the subgap region between @xmath124 and the position of the riedel peak .",

    "[ fig2 ] , where we have plotted the expressions @xmath128 ( see ref .  ) and @xmath129 respectively , shows for @xmath130 that sufficiently far from the position of the riedel peak the approximation @xmath131 holds which becomes exact for @xmath132 .",
    "hence , for @xmath123 one can write @xmath133    using this approximation , the supercurrent reads @xmath134 which corresponds for @xmath135 and @xmath136 exactly to the result of eq .",

    "there is no contradiction to the inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) because @xmath139 is satisfied provided that the relation @xmath27 holds .",
    "however , this condition is just necessary for single - charge tunneling because it guarantees that quantum fluctuations can be neglected . roughly speaking ( cf .",
