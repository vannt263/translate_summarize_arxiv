    "during the late quaternary period , after the last glacial maximum ( lgm ) , from 18 kyears ago till present , a global warming was responsible for the melting of the glaciers leading to a fast increase in the sea level . in approximately 13 kyears , the sea level rised up to about 120 meters , reaching the actual level",
    "however , the sea level did not go up in a continuous fashion , but rather , it has evolved in a pulsatile way , leaving behind a signature of what actually happened , the continental shelf , i.e. the seafloor .",
    "continental shelves are located at the boundary with the land so that they are shaped by both marine and terrestrial processes .",
    "sea - level oscillations incessantly transform terrestrial areas in marine environments and vice - versa , thus increasing the landscape complexity @xcite .",
    "the presence of regions with abnormal slope as well as the presence of terraces on a continental shelf are indicators of sea level positions after the last glacial maximum ( lgm ) , when large ice sheets covered high latitudes of europe and north america , and sea levels stood about 120 - 130 m lower than today @xcite .",
    "geomorphic processes responsible for the formation of these terraces and discontinuities on the bottom of the sea topography are linked to the coastal dynamics during eustatic processes associated with both erosional or depositional forcing ( wave cut and wave built terraces respectively @xcite ) .    the irregular distribution of such terraces and shoreface sediments is mainly controlled by the relationship between shelf paleo - physiography and changes on the sea level and sediment supply which reflect both global and local processes .",
    "several works have dealt with mapping and modeling the distribution of shelf terraces in order to understand the environmental consequences of climate change and sea level variations after the lgm @xcite .    in this period of time the sea - level transgression was punctuated by at least six relatively short flooding events that collectively accounted for more than 90 m of the 120 m rise .",
    "most ( but not all ) of the floodings appear to correspond with paleoclimatic events recorded in greenland and antarctic ice - cores , indicative of the close coupling between rapid climate change , glacial melt , and corresponding sea - level rise @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we analyze data from the southeastern brazilian continental shelf ( sbcs ) located in a typical sandy passive margin with the predominance of palimpsests sediments .",
    "the mean length is approximately 250 km and the shelfbreak is located at 150 m depth .",
    "it is a portion of a greater geomorphologic region of the southeastern brazilian coast called so paulo bight , an arc - shaped part of the southeastern brazilian margin .",
    "the geology and topography of the immersed area are very peculiar , represented by the mesozoic / cenozoic tectonic processes that generated the mountainous landscapes known as `` serra do mar '' . these landscapes ( with mean altitudes of 800 m ) have a complex pattern that characterize the coastal morphology , and",
    "leads to several scarps intercalated with small coastal plains and pocket beaches .",
    "this particular characteristic determines the development of several small size fluvial basins and absence of major rivers conditioning low sediment input , what tends to preserve topographic signatures of the sea - level variations .    for the purpose of the present study , we select three parallel profiles acquired from echo - sounding surveys , since for all the considered profiles ,",
    "the same similar series of sequences of terraces were found .",
    "these profiles @xcite are transversal to the coastline and the isobaths trend , and they extend from a 20 m to a 120 m depth .",
    "the importance of understanding the formation of these ridges is that it can tell us about the coastal morphodynamic conditions , inner shelf processes and about the characteristics of periods of the sea level regimes standstills ( paleoshores ) . in particular , the widths of the terraces are related to the time the sea level `` stabilized '' .",
    "all this information is vital for the better understanding of the late quaternary climate changes dynamic .",
    "we find relations between the widths of the terraces that follow a self - affine pattern description .",
    "these relations are given by a mathematical model , which describes an order of appearance for the terraces .",
    "our results suggest that this geomorphological structure for the terraces can be described by a devil s staircase @xcite , a staircase with infinitely many steps in between two steps .",
    "this property gives the name `` devil '' to the staircase , once an idealized being would take an infinite time to go from one step to another .",
    "so , the seafloor morphology is self - affine ( fractal structure ) as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , but according to our findings , it has a special kind of self - affine structure , the devil s staircase structure .",
    "a devil s staircase as well as other self - affine structure are the response of an oscillatory system when excited by some external force .",
    "the presence of a step means that while varying some internal parameter , the system preserves some averaged regular behavior , a consequence of the stable frequency - locking regime between a natural frequency of the system and the frequency of the excitation .",
    "this staircase as well as other self - affine structures are characterized by the presence of steps whose widths are directly related to the rational ratio between the natural frequency of the system and the frequency of the excitation .    in a similar fashion , we associate the widths of the terraces with rational numbers that represent two hypothetical frequencies of oscillation which are assumed to exist in the system that creates the structure of the sbcs , here regarded as the sea level dynamics ( sld ) , also known as the sea level variations .",
    "then , once these rational numbers are found , we show that the relative distances between triples of terraces ( associated with some hypothetical frequencies ) follow similar scalings found in the relative distance between triples of plateaus ( associated with these same frequencies ) observed in the devil s staircase .",
    "the seafloor true structure , apart from the dynamics that originated it , is also a very relevant issue , specially for practical applications .",
    "for example , one can measure the seafloor with one resolution and then reconstruct the rest based on some modeling @xcite . as we show in this work ( sec .",
    "[ model ] ) , a devil s staircase structure fits remarkably well the experimental data .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ data ] , we describe the data to be analyzed . in sec .",
    "[ devil ] , we describe which kind of dynamical systems can create a devil s staircase and how one can detect its presence in experimental data based on only a few observations . in sec .",
    "[ devil_in_data ] , we show the evidences that led us to characterize the sbcs as a devil s staircase , and in sec . [ model ] we show how to construct seafloor profiles based on the devil s staircase geometry . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusao ] , we present our conclusions , discussing also possible scenarios for the future of the sea level dynamics under the perspective of our findings .",
    "the data consists of the tree profiles given in fig . [ meco_fig1](a - b ) .",
    "the profile considered for our analyzes is shown in fig .",
    "[ meco_fig1](b ) , where we show the continental shelf of the state of so paulo , in a transversal cut in the direction : inner shelf ( `` cost '' ) @xmath0 shelfbreak ( `` open sea '' ) .",
    "the horizontal axis represents the distance to the cost and the vertical axis , the sea level ( depth ) , @xmath1 .",
    "we are interested in the terraces widths and their respective depths .",
    "the profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ meco_fig1 ] were the result of a smoothing ( filtering ) process from the original data collected by sonar @xcite .",
    "the smoothing process is needed to eliminate from the measured data the influence of the oscillations of the ship where the sonar is located and local oscillations on the sea floor probably due to the stream flows .",
    "smaller topographic terraces could be smoothed or masked due to several processes such as : coastal dynamic erosional during sea - level rising , holocene sediment cover , erosional processes associated with modern hidrodynamic pattern ( geostrophic currents ) .",
    "for that reason we only consider the largest ones , as the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ meco_fig2 ] , ( located at @xmath2 with the width of @xmath3 ) .",
    "as one can see , the edges of the terraces are not so sharp as one would expect from a staircase plateau .",
    "again , this is due to the action of the sea waves and stream flows throughout the time . to reconstruct what we believe to be the original terrace",
    ", we consider that its depth is given by the depth of the middle point , and its width is given by the minimal distance between two parallel lines placed along the scarps of the terrace edges",
    ". using this procedure , we construct table [ table1 ] with the largest and more relevant terraces found .    we identify a certain terrace introducing a lower index @xmath4 in @xmath5 and @xmath1 , according to their chronological order of appearance .",
    "more recent appearance ( closer to the cost , less deep ) smaller is the index @xmath4 .",
    "we consider the more recent data to have a zero distance from the cost , but in fact , this data is positioned at about 15 km away from the shore , where the bottom of the sea is not affected by the turbulent zone caused by the break out of the waves . the profile of fig .",
    "[ meco_fig1](b ) was the one chosen among the other tree profiles because from it we could more clearly identify the largest number of relevant terraces @xcite .",
    ".terrace widths and depths .",
    "while the depths present no representative deviation , the deviation in the widths become larger for deeper terraces .",
    "the deviation in the widths is estimated by calculating the widths assuming many possible configurations between the placement of the two parallel lines used to calculate the widths .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we do not expect to have eq .",
    "( [ regra_terrace_2 ] ) satisfied .",
    "we only require that the difference between the left and right hand sides of this equation , regarded as @xmath6 , is the lowest possible , among all possible values for @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 ) , for a given @xmath10 , with the restriction that the considered largest terraces are related to largest plateaus of eq .",
    "( [ circle_map ] ) , and thus @xmath11=@xmath12 and @xmath13=@xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",

    "using bigger values for @xmath29 has the only effect to increase the value of @xmath6 .",
    "we have not identified rationals that can be associated with the terraces @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which means that for @xmath29 and @xmath30 within @xmath33 $ ] and @xmath34 $ ] , we find that @xmath35 .",
    "we have assumed that they could be either a daughter or a parent .    from now on ,",
    "when convenient , we will drop the index @xmath4 and represent each terrace by the associated frequency ratio .",
    "so , the terrace 1 , for @xmath4=1 , is represented as the terrace with @xmath36 .",
    "table [ table2 ] can be represented in the form of the farey tree as shown in fig .",
    "[ meco_fig3 ] .",
    "the branch of rationals in the farey tree in the form @xmath37 belongs to the most stable branch , which means that the observed terraces should have the largest widths .",
    "we believe that the other less important branches of the complete devil s staircase present in the data were smoothed out by the action of the waves and the flow streams throughout the time , and at the present time can not be observed .",
    "notice that as the time goes by , the frequency ratios are increasing their absolute value , which means that if this tendency is preserved in the future , we should expect to see larger terraces .    in the following , we will try to recover in the experimental profile , the universal scaling laws of eqs .",
    "( [ scaling_1 ] ) and ( [ scaling_2 ] ) .",
    "regarding eq .",
    "( [ scaling_1 ] ) , we find that @xmath5 scales as @xmath38 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ meco_fig5 ] , which is the expected global universal scaling for a complete devil s staircase . regarding eq .",
    "( [ scaling_2 ] ) , and calculating @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 using the triple of terraces with widths @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , as represented in fig . [ meco_fig6_1 ] , we find @xmath45=0.89 .",
    "using the triple of terraces ( @xmath4=3,@xmath4=4,@xmath4=5 ) , we find that @xmath45=0.87 .",
    "both results are very close from the universal fractal dimension @xmath46 , found for a complete devil s staircase .",
    "motivated by our previous results , we fit the observed shelf as a complete devil s staircase , using eq .",
    "( [ circle_map ] ) .",
    "notice that the only requirement for eq .",
    "( [ circle_map ] ) to generate a complete devil s staircase is that the function @xmath47 has a cubic inflection point at the critical parameter @xmath48 .",
    "whether eq .",
    "( [ circle_map ] ) is indeed an optimal modeling for the shelf is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "we only chose this map because it is a well known system and it captures most of the relevant characteristic a dynamical systems needs to fulfill in order to create a devil s staircase .",
    "we model the sbcs as a complete devil s staircase , but we rescale the winding number @xmath49 into the observed terrace depth .",
    "so , we transform the complete devil s staircase of fig .",
    "[ meco_fig7 ] as good as possible into the profile of fig .",
    "[ meco_fig1](b ) , by rescaling the vertical axis of the staircase in fig .",
    "[ meco_fig7 ] .",
    "we do that by first obtaining the function @xmath50 ( see fig .",
    "[ meco_fig4 ] ) whose application into the terrace depth @xmath51 gives the frequency ratio @xmath52 associated with the terrace .",
    "for the triple of terraces @xmath53=(1/8,2/17,1/9 ) , we obtain @xmath54)=0.14219 + 0.00057853d[km ] ,   \\label{function_f1}\\ ] ] and for the triple of terraces @xmath53=(1/17,2/35,1/18 ) , we obtain @xmath54)=0.080941 + 0.00029786d[km ] .",
    "\\label{function_f2}\\ ] ] therefore , we assume that , locally , the frequency ratios are linearly related to the depth of the terraces .    then , we rescale the vertical axis of the staircases in figs .",
    "[ meco_fig7](a - b ) and calculate an equivalent depth , @xmath1 , for the winding number @xmath49 by using    @xmath55    we also allow tiny adjustments in the axes for a best fitting .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ meco_fig8](a ) for the triple of terraces @xmath53=(1/8,2/17,1/9 ) and in fig .",
    "[ meco_fig8](b ) for the triple of terraces @xmath53=(1/17,2/35,1/18 ) .",
    "we see that locally , for a short time interval , we can have a good agreement of the terrace widths and positions , with the rescaled devil s staircase . however , globally , the fitting in ( a ) does not do well , as it is to be expected since the function @xmath50 is only locally well defined and it changes depending on the depths of the terraces .",
    "notice however that this short time interval is not so short since the time interval correspondent to a triple of terraces is of the order of a few hundred years .",
    "the assumption made that @xmath48 is also supported from eq .",
    "( [ cutoff ] ) . using this equation",
    ", we can obtain an estimation of the maximum value of @xmath56 from a terrace with a frequency ratio that has the largest denominator . in our case , we observed @xmath57 . using @xmath58=35 in eq .",
    "( [ cutoff ] ) , we obtain @xmath59 .    in fig .",
    "[ meco_fig8](a ) , we see a 1/7 plateau positioned in the zero sea level . that is the current level .",
    "thus , the model predicts that nowadays we should have a large terrace , which might imply in an average stabilization of the sea level for a large period of time .",
    "however , this prediction might not correspond to reality if the sea dynamics responsible for the creation of the observed continental shelf suffered structurally modifications .",
    "we have shown some experimental evidences that the southern brazilian continental shelf ( sbcs ) has a structure similar to the devil s staircase .",
    "that means that the terraces found in the bottom of the sea are not randomly distributed but they occur following a dynamical rule .",
    "this finding lead us to model the sbcs as a complete devil s staircase , in which , between two real terraces , we suppose an infinite number of virtual ( smaller ) ones .",
    "we do not find these later ones , either because they have been washed out by the stream flow or simply due to the fact that the time period in which the sea level dynamics ( sld ) stayed locked was not sufficient to create a terrace . by our hypothesis",
    ", the sld creates a terrace if it is a dynamics in which two relevant frequencies are locked in a rational ratio .",
    "this special phase - locked dynamics possesses a critical characteristic : large changes in some parameter responsible for a relevant natural frequency of the sld might not destroy the phase - locked regime , which might imply that the averaged sea level would remain still . on the other hand , small changes in the parameter associated with an external forcing of the sld could be catastrophic , inducing a chaotic sld , what would mean a turbulent averaged sea level rising / regression .    in order to interpret the shelf as a devil s staircase",
    ", we have shown that the terraces appear in an organized way according to the farey mediant , the rule that describes the way plateaus appear in the devil s staircase .",
    "that allow us to `` name '' each terrace depth , @xmath60 , by a rational number , @xmath61 , regarded as the hypothetical frequency ratio .",
    "arguably , these ratios represent the ratio between real frequencies that are present in the sld .",
    "it is not the scope of the present work to verify this hypothesis , however , one way to check if the hypothetical frequency ratios are more than just a mathematical artifact would be to check if the sld has , nowadays , two relevant frequencies in a ratio 1/7 , as predicted .    the newly proposed approach to characterize the sbcs rely mainly on the ratios between terraces widths and between terraces depths . while single terrace widths and depths are strongly influenced by local properties of the costal morphology and the local sea level variations , the ratios between terrace widths and depths should be a strong indication of the global sea level variations .",
    "therefore , the newly proposed approach has a general character and it seems to be appropriated as a tool of analysis to other continental shelves around the world .    reminding that the local morphology of the studied area , the `` serra do mar '' does not have a strong impact in the formation of the shelf and assuming that the local sld is not directed involved in the formation of the large terraces considered in our analyses , thus",
    ", our results should reflect mainly the action of the global sld .",
    "if the characteristics observed locally in the so paulo bight indeed reflect the effect of the global sld , then the global sld might be a critical system .",
    "hopefully , the environmental changes caused by the modern men have not yet made any significant change in a relevant parameter of this global system .",
    "the profiles used in this work were obtained by the use of polinomial spilines in a two dimensional grip of points 10 km appart .",
    "this also imposes limits in the indentification of terraces that have small widths ."
