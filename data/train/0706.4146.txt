    "measuring the fe abundance is one of the essential clues to classify the sn type of any specific remnant .",
    "the k - shell x - ray emission lines from ionized fe offer the most direct information for abundance determination .",
    "in fact , strong fe - k@xmath4 lines had been observed from tycho s snr ( e.g. , hwang et al .",
    "1998 ; decourchelle et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in sn  1006 ,",
    "vink et al .  ( 2000 ) suggested the possible presence of an fe - k emission line at 6.3@xmath50.2  kev from the bepposax mecs spectrum .",
    "however , the detection was not clear , because the energy resolution of the mecs ( a gas scintillation counter ) was relatively poor ( fwhm@xmath6500  ev @6  kev ) .",
    "other recent x - ray missions , chandra and xmm - newton , have not succeeded in detecting an fe - k line .",
    "cold fe in the interior of sn  1006 is known to exist based on ultraviolet absorption studies .",
    "blue and red - shifted fe absorption lines were detected in the spectra of background stars ( wu et al .",
    "1993 ; hamilton et al .  1997 ; winkler et al .",
    "2005 ) , and interpreted as being due to unshocked fe in the interior of the remnant .",
    "these results show that portions of the fe - rich ejecta are still expanding freely , and have not yet been overrun by the reverse shock .",
    "however the amount of fe inferred in these studies ( @xmath7 0.16 m@xmath8 ) is much less than the amount ( 0.60.8 m@xmath8 ) predicted to be produced in the thermonuclear disintegration of a @xmath61.4 m@xmath8 white dwarf .    in the early phases of supernova remnant evolution ,",
    "even the shock - heated plasma is far from thermal equilibrium in terms of either the ionization or particle ( electron and ion ) temperatures .",
    "the ionization age , a key diagnostic of the non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) state , is defined as @xmath9 , the product of the electron density and the time since the gas was heated .",
    "typically , @xmath9 is required to be @xmath10  @xmath1  s for full ionization equilibrium ( masai 1984 ) .",
    "the thermal x - ray spectrum of sn  1006 suggests an ionization timescale of @xmath11  @xmath1  s ( vink et al .",
    "2000 ) , which is far from the full ionization equilibrium , and lower than nearly all other galactic snrs .",
    "the electron temperature at the northwest rim of the remnant has been estimated to be @xmath12  kev ( long et al .",
    "2003 ) or @xmath13  kev ( vink et al .",
    "2003 ) . since these values are much lower than the ion temperature expected from the shock velocity of @xmath62980  km  s@xmath14 ( ghavamian et al .",
    "2002 ) , non - equilibration of ion and electron temperatures is present in sn  1006 as well .",
    "the extreme non - equilibrium state and high shock velocity are likely due to the low density of the ambient gas , because sn  1006 ( @xmath15 ) is further from the galactic plane than other galactic snrs , such as cas  a ( @xmath16 ) and tycho s snr ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "although kepler s snr ( @xmath18 ) is nearly as far above the plane as sn1006 ( when their respective distances are included ) , kepler appears to be evolving into a dense circumstellar medium .",
    "therefore , the evolutionary state of sn  1006 may be the lowest of these youngest galactic snrs , even though the real age is @xmath63 times older than the others .    in this paper",
    ", using the type ia snr , sn  1006 , we consider the x - ray spectra to investigate this very early phase of snr evolution .",
    "suzaku ( mitsuda et al .  2007 ) , with its high sensitivity for diffuse sources and spectroscopic resolution in the @xmath6510  kev energy range , is well - suited for this study .",

    "this paper reports on the imaging and spectral results obtained with the xis .",
    "the xis consist of three front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds and one back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd .",

    "in particular that of nxb , we applied the same data - screening criteria to both the sn  1006 se and nep observations , and took background spectra from the same detector coordinates as the source regions after excluding point - like sources detected in the nep data .",

    "2002 ) . in the initial fits",
    ", we found a significant inconsistency between the fi and bi spectra near the energy of the o - edge  ( 0.54  kev ) .",
    "this may be due to incomplete calibration information for the contamination layer on the optical blocking filter ( obf ) of the xis ( koyama et al .",
    "since the calibration of the obf contamination for the bi is more accurate than that for the fi , we decided to retain the bi data across this energy band and ignore the 0.50.63  kev band in the fi spectrum .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : low]a , with the best - fit temperature and ionization parameter of @xmath38 0.58  ( 0.560.59 )  kev and @xmath39 6.7  ( 6.66.8 )  @xmath35  @xmath1  s.    in figure  [ fig : low]a , we find an apparent disagreement between the data and model in the @xmath60.70.85  kev energy band . usually , this energy band is dominated by the iron l - shell line transitions of @xmath40  ( @xmath6730  ev ) and @xmath41  ( @xmath6830  ev ) from fe .",
    "although the fluxes of these two lines in nei models are nearly equal over a wide range of plasma conditions , extrapolation to the extremely low ionization states that we see here in sn  1006 is quite uncertain . in particular , for the young type ia snr e0509@xmath42 , warren and hughes ( 2004 ) found that the fe l - shell emission was dominated by an emission from a line feature near 0.73 kev , which was not sufficiently strong in the spectral models and had to be included as a separate gaussian component .",
    "based on the strength of other fe - l emission lines and the weakness of o emission in e0509@xmath42 the additional line feature at 0.73 kev was confidently associated with fe - l emission .",
    "although we can not eliminate the possibility that the residual comes from faint fe - l emission , here we consider a different explanation .",
    "the best - fit spectral model of the oxygen lines are shown in figure  [ fig : low]b , in which the black and red solid lines are k - shell transitions from o and o , respectively . in most astrophysical plasmas , the best - fit temperature of @xmath60.6  kev gives weak k - shell lines of o compared to those of o. on the other hand , in lower temperature plasmas ( e.g. , @xmath43  kev ) where the o k@xmath4 line is dominant , the line fluxes decrease rapidly along the k - shell transition series ( k@xmath44 , etc . ) .",
    "therefore , k - shell lines in the higher transitions can be safely ignored , and hence conventional nei codes do not include o k - shell transition lines higher than k@xmath45 .",
    "this is the reason that no oxygen line in the @xmath60.70.85  kev band is present in the best - fit model ( figure  [ fig : low]b ) . in sn  1006 , however , the ionization timescale is low , while @xmath34 is moderate , so the fluxes of higher level k - shell transitions from o may be relatively strong and can not be ignored . to account for them",

    "the flux ratio of o  ly@xmath46 to ly@xmath45 predicted by the neivers  1.1 code is @xmath60.5 ( see figure  [ fig : low]b ) . in the absence of a detailed calculation we merely assumed that the flux ratio of the o lines follow the same pattern , namely k@xmath46/k@xmath45 = k@xmath47/k@xmath46 = 0.5 .",
    "the best - fit results with these additional lines , see figure  [ fig : low]c , are a reasonably good fit . the additional artificial lines are also shown as the dotted lines in figure  [ fig : low]b .",

    "our two - component spectral model for the ejecta is a highly simplified view of what is surely a complex multi-@xmath9 and multi-@xmath34 structure that varies throughout the interior of the snr .",
    "a longer observation , particularly of the inner regions of sn  1006 , will help to improve the statistical accuracy of the fe - k line flux , and allow us to study this apparent discrepancy in more detail .",

    "this is consistent with our estimate of the ambient density of @xmath100  @xmath1 .",
    "the low density of the ambient medium will allow the velocity of the shock front to remain high for a relatively long time .",
