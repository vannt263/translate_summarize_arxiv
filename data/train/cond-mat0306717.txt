    "models used in demand analysis of transportation and communication problems usually assume that demand represents the result of decisions of each individual in the population .",
    "these decisions consist of choices made among finite sets of possibilities . as an example of a sequence of choices , in the context of airline transportation demand , consider decision to be taken by potential air passenger .",
    "if the passenger wills to fly from the origin port @xmath1 to destination port @xmath2 , he has to choose among offers of carriers , accounting for many factors relevant for decision , as e.g. scheduled departure and arrival times and how they relate to his needs , flight durations , flight fares , numbers of stops and changes on the route @xmath3 , availability of seats in first class , probability of delays , declared and expected quality of service and many other aspects , too numerous to itemize . in order to quantify such process of decision making ,",
    "one incorporates discrete choice models in hope of better understanding and predicting behaviour of such complex system as transportation network and thus obtaining hints for marketing and revenue management decisions .",
    "one of the key concepts used in decision theory , dating back to the xix - th century economy by jeremy bentham and other representatives of so called utilitarians economy , is the concept of _ utility _ , which had been further evolving since that time and found its more rigorous utterance in the classical work of von neumann and morgenstern @xcite and in neoclassical economic theory ( cf",
    ". e.g. refs @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "utility function ascribes real numbers to alternatives and so defines the preference order on the choice set and puts the choice making process on more rational footing .",
    "an approach to communication based on discrete choice models has long history and abundant literature ( cf .",
    "e.g. refs @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "utility function in neoclassical economic theory is defined axiomatically . in order to use it in specific applications of choice models ,",
    "one has to postulate a lot from outside of the theory and to find an effective way to either derive it from any fundamental or general theory or to parametrize it and estimate from data .",
    "derivation of the utility function from first principles represents major theoretical problem because of lack of fundamental theory of human behaviour .",
    "normally , one has to rely on partially justified models using power series approximations for utility functions , often restricted to linear or quadratic terms ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and finding empirically relevant variables and estimators for parameters , if any data are available at all .",
    "apart from those problems , numerous conceptual difficulties arise when applying utility functions to quantify the behaviour of the choice makers and to predict them .",
    "in particular , classical bentham s approach of maximizing the overall utility , integrated over individuals , when taking market decisions , is often a subject of serious objections @xcite .",
    "being aware of a long - lasting debate around the meaning and the role of utility functions in economy , social sciences and , more generally , in game theory , in this paper we try to incorporate it into economic games on somewhat different way .",
    "first , extending from the concept of utility , we find an analogy between the utility function , as it is used in choice models , and the energy function for physical systems .",
    "after specifying the system , consisting of an airline network and a set of passengers , and its state space , we discuss assumptions normally taken in theories of systems in thermal equilibrium and build quasistatic probability measures on the state space for equilibrium ensembles .",
    "this allows us to derive complete classical thermodynamics for the communication network .",
    "we consider the canonical and the grand canonical statistical ensembles for systems with fixed and variable numbers of clients .    as a possible extension of the model",
    ", we propose to consider also the network topology and the number of network vertices as a multidimensional random variable and formulate generalized canonical ensemble where the existence of any connection between sites may fluctuate and is represented by a binomial random variable . in the frameworks of the canonical and the grand canonical formalisms , we find some analytical results for thermodynamics of particular network topologies and perform numerical simulations .",
    "we study thermodynamical potentials , response functions and correlations between extensive variables in the system .",
    "the case of random topology is discussed in general terms only .",
    "it needs more study of a couple of specific and self - contained problems and this , altogether with numerical results , is relegated to future work .",
    "we also develop another approach , based on so called @xmath0-distributions or _ escort _ distributions , which allows us to monitor fluctuations and correlations of interesting characteristics of the network , their temperature evolution and phase relations in the network .",
    "building our formalism we keep in mind its specific application to networks of airline traffic and often use its terminology , although we believe that this framework and most of its features are general enough to be used for other network - related problems , as various kinds of telecommunication , communications in social groups , traffic routing , energy networks , etc . on the other hand ,",
    "the model we build does not account for many features of real airline markets , either because of lack of knowledge about utility functions or simplifications of the model at this stage .",
    "in choice models considered here we assume that decision makers are individuals and that these individuals are independent of each other .",
    "such models are usually called _ disaggregate_. assumption on independence of decisions between individuals is rather poorly justified and often just not true in reality . but for many practical applications this assumption is not restrictive and depends on further details of the model , in particular on the utility function . in many cases , also in this paper , one may redefine the notion of a decision maker and consider a group of individuals as the decision maker , without loss of generality , and only mutual independence of such defined decision makers is relevant .",
    "this assumption can be further criticized because the ways decisions are taken by groups , even for very restricted class of consumer decisions considered here , certainly depend on the size and internal communication structure of groups and are qualitatively different than in case of individuals .",
    "thus the utility function for aggregated decision makers may differ from that of individuals . in order to give full account of these diffences in general case , which we do not pretend to do in this paper",
    ", one has to consider many additional effects , as internal negotiations inside groups , their dynamics , possible splits , compactness of groups etc .",
    "however , at this stage of model development and for the case of limited number of variables relevant for utility , and for reasonably homogeneous groups , we feel it is fair to assume that utilities for all decision makers are independent and identically distributed stochastic variables . in other words , we assume high degree of _ decision coherence _ of groups , in the sense that decisions of aggregated individuals do not differ significantly from that of real individuals .",
    "analysis of the choice requires knowledge of the complete set of options disponsible for the choice maker .",
    "the set of options , or alternatives , @xmath4 is called _ the choice set _ @xmath5 .",
    "the complete set of all possible options available to any individual is called _ the universal choice set _ and a subset of the universal choice set considered by a particular individual is called _ the reduced choice set_. if @xmath6 is the universal choice set then all possible reduced choice sets correspond to events and form what is called _ @xmath7-algebra over @xmath6 _ in the probability calculus .",
    "hereon we assume that results of a choice performed by any decision maker are unique for given specification of the choice set .",
    "this means that results of a choice are those elements of @xmath7-algebra which correspond to elementary events of the probability theory .",
    "finally , we consider only _ discrete choice models _ , i.e. those for which their choice sets are finite and all options can be explicitly enumerated .",
    "each alternative of the choice set can be characterized by a set of _",
    "generally , attributes are random variables in the sense used in probability theory , i.e. they are funcions defined on reduced choice sets with values in other sets . we consider both directly observable attributes and functions of attributes .    in order to construct decision rules , the decision maker has to be able to compare alternatives . in neocalassical economy @xcite two alternatives @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "are comparable using _ the preference - indifference _",
    "operator @xmath10 which orders @xmath6 linearly , i.e.    1 .",
    "the @xmath10 is reflexive : @xmath11 2 .",
    "the @xmath10 is transitive : @xmath12 3 .",
    "any two alternatives are comparable : @xmath13    since the choice set @xmath6 is finite , the existence of the most preferred alternative @xmath14 is guaranteed @xmath15 because of the properties ( [ eq1]-[eq3 ] ) there exists finite random variable @xmath16 , refered to as _ the utility function _",
    ", such that @xmath17 from eq . ( [ eq4 ] )",
    "it follows that the most prefered alternative @xmath14 has the largest utility @xmath18 @xmath19 or the smallest _ disutility _ @xmath20 .",
    "hence , important property of @xmath21    disutility function is bounded from bottom .      our system @xmath22 consists of a complex communication network @xmath23 , represented by a set of directed graphs , and set of decision makers .",
    "nodes of graphs in @xmath23 represent airports and its directed edges correspond to air connections between them . each ordered pair @xmath3 of the origin @xmath1 and destination @xmath2 ports and set of all directed paths , called _ routes _",
    ", connecting @xmath1 and @xmath2 , excluding loops , constitute the @xmath24-th _ market _ and is represented by the graph @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the whole network @xmath23 is the sum of market graphs @xmath27 using graph - theoretic terminology , markets are represented by sets of hamilton paths , i.e. no one site on the route is visited more than once .",
    "so defined markets can overlap .",
    "the system is further specified by defining all features relevant for its state as sets of potential passengers ( decision makers ) for each market , resources of aircrafts , flight schedules , flight fares , etc . _",
    "the state _ of the system is defined using results of choices performed by all decision makers , which means that the state - space consists of all possible distributions of all decision makers for all markets of the network .",
    "we assume quasistatic approximation , meaning that any time variation of the system as a whole is slow compared to the time of individual decision .",
    "moreover , specifying the state of the system , we accumulate decisions taken by individuals in time interval at least an order of magnitude shorter than the system time scale , but not necessarily short compared to individual decision time . in airline practice ,",
    "one day is normally a good time bin for accumulation of decisions .",
    "in present model we do not embed the network in any metric space , such that only the topology , or connectivity scheme , is relevant and not the geometry .",
    "accounting for geometry may appear necessary along with sofistication of our model for utility .    for each market @xmath24",
    "we define the total _ market disutility _ as a sum of disutilities of all passengers from this market @xmath28 where @xmath29 stands for index of the @xmath30-th passenger in the @xmath24-th market @xmath31 @xmath32 overall _ network disutility _ @xmath33 is a sum of market disutilities over all @xmath34 markets @xmath35    states of the system are defined in discretized time , which means that for definitions of functions of states we use all individual decisions taken in given time interval , e.g. one day .      in order to find the probability of the state of the network using utility function and incorporating classical boltzmann - gibbs arguments",
    ", the utility has to be _ an additive stochastic variable_. disutility @xmath21 of the system is called additive with respect to any two subsystems @xmath36 and @xmath37 if their disutilities add up to @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath38 ( cf . e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for more detailed discussion ) . therefore , additivity requires the notion of the subsystem to be clarified first . in our case ,",
    "the subsystems can not be defined by dividing the connectivity net only , because the smallest meaningful entities in the theory are the markets , represented by graphs @xmath25 @xmath39 .",
    "we decompose the system @xmath22 into the sum of markets @xmath40 where @xmath41 means the set sum of corresponding graphs _ and",
    "_ individuals being ascribed to corresponding markets .",
    "[ fig : fg0 ] illustrates decomposition of an example system into markets .",
    "decomposition of the network into markets , width=302,height=207 ]    each market @xmath42 can be further split into routes @xmath43 $ ] in the same way . for our example from fig .",
    "[ fig : fg0 ] decomposition of markets into routes is the following : @xmath44 \\nonumber \\\\ ( 1,3 ) & = & [ 1,2,3]\\oplus [ 1,2,4,3 ] \\nonumber \\\\ ( 1,4 ) & = & [ 1,2,4]\\oplus [ 1,2,3,4 ] \\nonumber \\\\ ( 2,3 ) & = & [ 2,3 ] \\oplus [ 2,4,3 ] \\nonumber \\\\ ( 2,4 ) & = & [ 2,4 ] \\oplus [ 2,3.4 ] \\nonumber \\\\ ( 3,4 ) & = & [ 3,4 ] \\oplus [ 3,2,4 ]   \\label{eq8_2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and reversed @xmath45 pairs .    for subsystems defined in this way , from the definition of network disutility ( [ eq7],[eq8 ] )",
    ", it follows by construction    network disutility is an additive random function of state .",
    "in addition , also _ the extensivity _ of disutility , in the sense used in ref .",
    "@xcite , can be easily justified . if @xmath46 is the number of decision makers in the system , then thermodynamic limit of disutility exists @xmath47 for @xmath21 proportional to @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) . by definition ,",
    "this is our case with @xmath50 , hence    network disutility is an extensive random function of state .    from properties 1 , 2 and 3 it follows , that network disutility function has all the same properties relevant for the construction of probability measure as the total energy function of finite physical system with no long - range interactions .",
    "therefore it can play the same role in construction of statistical ensemble of systems as hamiltonians do , viz .",
    "it can be used for definition of the exponential probability measure on the state - space . for doing this",
    "we note that because of assumption of disaggregate choice model and additivity of disutilities , for any two subgroups of passengers , either belonging to different markets or from the same market , disutilities of subgroups are independent of each other .",
    "hence , we find    for any independent subgroups of decision makers , disutilities of subgroups are mutually independent random variables .",
    "validity of boltzmann and gibbs arguments , as applied to @xmath21 , follows from properties 1 - 4 .",
    "hence , the probability of the state of the network for given value @xmath51 of the network disutility @xmath33 is equal to @xmath52 an important consequence of this is that one can consider statistical ensemble of networks and statistical thermodynamics for them with the probability density ( [ eq9 ] ) , and there is no need for non - extensive statistics with power - law stochastic measure . at first sight , this seems counter intuitive because of apparent long - range correlations in the communication network which usually entails usage of non - extensive statistics ( cf .",
    "this is understandable when realizing that only sites , and not markets , are really correlated in this model .",
    "markets , representing elementary objects in the system , are uncorrelated since decision makers decide on routes only , as mentioned above .",
    "the choice of the market is not a subject of the game considered here .",
    "correlations between markets appear when additional constraints are taken into account , as e.g. finite transmittance of nodes .    in the following",
    "we restrict our model to equilibrium thermodynamics , or require existence of stationary states , which on turn requires assumption on existence of the first moment of disutility function @xmath53 otherwise , the equilibrium temperature @xmath54 would not exist .",
    "we are not particularly concerned here neither in studying processes leading to equilibrium nor in all sufficient conditions for existence of equilibria in general .",
    "therefore we do not start our discussion of ensembles from defining transition probabilities and deriving probability densities from detailed balance .    in our approach",
    "we do not incorporate random intensive variables .",
    "it has been recently shown @xcite that in the most general case of all variables of the system being stochastic , including intensive ones , one arrives to the class of ensembles with even more general proability densities than levy and tsallis power - law functions .",
    "our assumption purposefully limits generality of statistical ensembles considered here , since our original intent was to consider intensive variables of the system as simple steering parameters .",
    "assuming existence of stationary regime for time evolution of complex network and using utility functions discussed above , it is straightforward to find probability measure on the state - space of the network .",
    "as known from statistical thermodynamics , the specific form of the probability density is determined by the nature of constraints on the system , or the set of variables of merit which are allowed to be stochastic .      in the simplest case of disutilities being the same for all states of the system or , for non - discrete case , localized in very narrow interval @xmath55 $ ] , @xmath56",
    ", one normally assumes the probabilities for all states being the same and calls it _ the principle of a priori equal probabilities_. ensemble of systems so defined is called _ the microcanonical ensemble _ and corresponds to the extremly tight , and rather unrealistic in our case , constraints imposed on the system , and on the set of decision makers in particular .",
    "this means that the overall disutility is insensitive to the distribution of decision makers which could be interpreted as either lack of decision makers sensitivity to the conditions of the network or as an extremly poor offer of the carrier , giving no choice to its customers .",
    "this is rather trivial case and we do not discuss it furtheron .",
    "as the first non - trivial case consider _ the canonical ensemble _ of systems where the number @xmath57 of decision makers is fixed and the structure of connectivity , or the topology of the connections network , does not vary in time .",
    "one defines _ the partition function _ or _ the statistical sum _ of the system @xmath58 the @xmath59 stands for the partition function of the @xmath24-th market and index @xmath60 runs over all @xmath61 distributions of passengers over routes belonging to the @xmath24-th market .",
    "note that each market itself is treated here as a canonical ensemble , which means that also numbers of clients @xmath62 ( @xmath26 ) belonging to each market is fixed .",
    "this means that potential passengers from given origin node are at least decided as for their destination node , although they may not _ a priori _ know which route to fly there .",
    "due to additivity of disutility for each market ( [ eq7 ] ) the @xmath63 can be rewritten in terms of explicit sums over @xmath64 routes for the @xmath24-th market @xmath65 where @xmath66 are passenger s indices running over @xmath64 routes and @xmath67 runs over passengers .",
    "assuming further the _ non - subjectivity _ of the utility , i.e. that utility for given route does not depend on the decision maker , @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , the partition function for the @xmath24-th market can be written as @xmath70 where @xmath71 stands for the partition function for the @xmath24-th market with one passenger on it .",
    "the state of the system in the canonical ensemble is defined by specifying disutility for the complete set of distributions of passengers over all markets , i.e. @xmath72 . probabilities of states are @xmath73 noteworthly , the choice probability given by formula ( [ eq14 ] ) is the same as obtained in the framework of _ the multinomial logit choice models _ , usually using strong assumptions on the type of distributions , extreme value or gumbel , for the stochastic components of the utility ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "mean disutility can be calculated using ( [ eq14 ] ) , or by diffentiation over the lagrange multiplier @xmath74 : @xmath75 and if its value @xmath76 is also known from measurements , their equality determines the equilibrium temperature @xmath77 .",
    "the entropy and disutility fluctuations are given by formulae @xmath78 and @xmath79      in _ the grand canonical _ case , both disutility @xmath21 and the number of decision makers @xmath57 represent random variables , but the connectivity of the network remains fixed .",

    "following intuitive meaning of the chemical potential for physico - chemical systems , _ a priori _ one could think about different chemical potentials for different markets , as individual passengers from different markets may contribute unequally to the overall disutility of the system .",
    "here we assume , however , _ the hypothesis of chemical uniformity _ of the system which states that chemical potentials of all markets are equal : @xmath84 .",
    "this hypothesis does not exclude multiphase systems from our considerations , so that our communication network corresponds to the case of a one - component , though not necessarily one - phase , chemical system .",
    "in further sofistication of this formalism one should categorize passengers regarding professions , wealth , aims of travels etc , and consider different chemical potentials for different categories .",

    "we observe that degree of those equations depends on the symmetry of the network and is equal to the number of topologically different markets for given networks : for the maximum connectivity all markets are the same , for hub - and - spoke there are two types of markets and for the spider - web there are three types of markets .",
    "we further observe that the number of local minima is less by one than the degree of those equations .",
    "we strongly suspect that this is true for higher numbers of different markets . at the moment",

    "it is interesting to observe that for certain values of @xmath162 , where the hub - rim market occupancy increases with temperature , two other sorts of markets tend to decrease , reaching local or global maxima .",
    "such non - trivial behaviour demonstrates potential power of the model developed here , for estimation of market occupancies .",
    "summarizing , we proposed a formalism , based on the equilibrium statistical thermodynamics , describing complex communication systems , consisting of sets of communicating nodes and individuals able to make decisions on how they travel . in classical approach to the problem of choice making , based on game theory , the key concept is the utility function which quantifies choice probabilities .",
    "utility function was defined axiomatically , according to neoclassical economic theory .",
    "we defined our system as a sum of markets , each market represented by a directed graph with two communicating endpoints and set of hamilton paths connecting them .",
    "our networks were not embeded in metric spaces and thus the model deals with topologies and not with geometry .",
    "the state of the system is defined by ascribing each individual to the market and specifying its choice of the comunication route .",
    "disutility of the whole system , ascribed to each state of it , is defined as a sum of individual disutilities , integrated over all markets .",
    "we have shown that such disutility is an additive and extensive stochastic function and therefore the probability measure on the state space is of boltzmann type , thus reproducing the multinomial logit choice model , known from decision theory , using quite general and fundamental reasoning .",
    "further , we considered statistical ensembles : the microcanonical , canonical , grand canonical and super canonical .",
    "the first three are commonly known in statistical mechanics and are rather straightforward to construct and use , whereas the super canonical ensemble incorporates random network topology and needs much further and more detailed specifications .",
    "we did not randomize intensive variables and kept them as nonrandom variables or control parameters .",
    "generalizations in this direction and using random intensive fields of temperature , pressure etc . seem quite natural and are certainly ahead of us in further developments .",
    "incorporation of geometry , i.e. using metric characteristics of connections like distances , shapes etc .",
    ", are quite straightforward but not equally relevant in all applications . in particular , for airline networks",
    ", topology plays principal role , as long as intercontinental connections are not concerned .",
    "following usual procedures , known from classical equilibrium therodynamics , we find the entropy and first moments of extensive random variables of the model and their correlations .",
    "we also propose using escort distributions for monitoring of temperature evolution of moments of stochastic variables .",
    "we applied our model to networks with specified topologies and we obtained analytical results for two topologies : the maximum connectivity and the hub - and - spoke , using rather simplistic disutility function , proportional to the number of route segments . for this disutility we found physical analogy , as the hierarchy of routes of lengths increasing in steps of one unit",
    "can be directly mapped onto the one - dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator and exhibits close analogy to systems of bosons . for the spider - web topology",
    "the formulae can be also found but are very complex .",
    "any network can be in principle simulated numerically .",
    "we performed such simulations , in the framework of the grand canonical ensemble for all topologies , in order to crosscheck our analytical findings .",
    "our simulations , however , were done so far for rather small networks consisting of five nodes and average number of thousand decision makers .",
    "evaluation of statistical sums requires summing over all possible distributions of decision makers over all hamiltonian paths on the graph and this is in general very demanding computationally .",
    "since the world air traffic integrated over one day incorporates millions of passengers , its realistic simulations , even with tight constraints not accounted so far , will require more efficient software tools .",
    "we see considerable economic potential of our thermodynamic approach to the process of decision making in communicating population . after complementing the model with constraints making it more suitable for real life applications in air transportation , as bunching of passengers in finite - size planes , realistic flight schedules , availability of air space and time slots , finite node transmittance , accounting for delays and other perturbations , and finally ,",
    "using realistic disutility function , and many other factors , it can be used for monitoring and forecasting the state of the network . predictions for market occupancies and fluctuations of numbers of individuals depending on passenger s disutility and all types of correlations between disutilities and occupancies are useful for management of resources .      * network description in the framework of super - canonical ensemble , i.e. using random topology , and incorporation of geometric characteristics of the network by embeding the graph in metric space , * monitoring of collective phenomena in the communication network using entropies , response functions and an approach based on the phase space uniformity , developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , * transforming our choice model into the full game , with airline operators and carriers being also active players in such game .",
    "this needs finding a coupling mechanism between utility functions of all parties , being e.g. typical predator - prey coupling of the lotka - volterra type , as a good starting point for further developments .",
