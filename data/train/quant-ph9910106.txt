    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) is a technique to provide two parties with a secure , secret and shared key .",
    "such a key is the necessary ingredient to the only _ provably _ secure way to communicate with guaranteed privacy , the one - time pad or vernam cipher @xcite .",
    "the first complete protocol was given by bennett and brassard @xcite ( bb84 ) following first ideas by wiesner @xcite .",
    "it uses the fact that any channel which transmits two non - orthogonal states perfectly , automatically makes eavesdropping on this channel detectable .",
    "we consider the bb84 protocol in a typical quantum optical implementation .",
    "ideally , alice sends a sequence of single photons which are at random polarized in one of the following four states : right or left circular polarized , or vertically or horizontally polarized .",
    "bob chooses at random between two polarization analyzers , one distinguishing the circular polarized states , and the other distinguishing the linear polarized states . following a public discussion about the basis of the sent signals and the measurement apparatus applied to them , sender and receiver",
    "can obtain a shared key made up from those signals where the measurement device gives deterministic results .",
    "this is the _ sifted key _",
    "proofs of security of this scheme against the most general attack , even in the presence of noise , have been obtained @xcite . in this article",
    "we follow another goal : we would like to illuminate to which extend already very simple attacks can render qkd  impossible once realistic imperfections like lossy lines and non - ideal signal states are taken into account .",
    "the difficulties implied , for example , by the use of weak coherent states in combination with lossy lines has been pointed out earlier @xcite and this subject has been illuminated in depth in @xcite , where bounds on coverable distances are given . positive security proofs for sufficiently short distances and taking into account the realistic signals are given for individual attacks @xcite and coherent attacks @xcite .",
    "the eavesdropping attacks which crack the secrecy of the key for set - ups exceeding this secure distances are still quite complicated .",
    "the eavesdropper needs to perform a qnd measurement on the total photon number of the signal , then he has to split a photon off the occurring multi - photon signals @xcite , store that photon , and then , finally , measure it after the public discussion .    in this paper we are looking into much simpler eavesdropping strategies which make use of the opportunities arising from lossy lines and non - ideal signals .",
    "such an attack has been proposed by bennett @xcite and yuen @xcite .",
    "it uses the fact that eve can , with finite probability , discriminate the four signal states unambiguously .",
    "whenever such a discrimination is performed successfully , the eavesdropper knows immediately which of the four signal states was sent and can send this information via a classical channel to bob s detector , in front of which she places a state preparation machine to prepare the identified state . this way this state does not experience the losses of the actual quantum channel without that eve has to invest into a perfect quantum channel .",
    "the investigation of this scenario refines bennett s and yuen s analysis since it takes into account that , to a certain extend , the photon statistics of the signals arriving at bob s detectors can be monitored .",
    "the results illuminate the restrictions placed on implementations of qkd  on lines with strong losses .",
    "thereby we can show that the currently widely used conditional security standard of security against beamsplitting attacks @xcite is incomplete .",
    "especially , contrary to common belief , the use of unambiguous state discrimination can be a more efficient eavesdropping strategy than the beamsplitting attack , even for dim coherent states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secunambiguous ] we recapitulate the principles of unambiguous state discrimination .",

    "[ secstrategy ] we introduce an eavesdropping attack based on unambiguous state discrimination ( usd  attack ) and analyze it in detail , taking the photon number distribution of the signals arriving at bob s detectors into account . in sec .",
    "[ secusd ] we discuss the relation between the beam splitting attack and the usd   attack .",
    "[ secconclusions ] concludes the article with a short summary .",
    "unambiguous state discrimination is possible whenever the @xmath0 states in question are linearly independent .",
    "the problem can be described by a measurement which can give the results `` state 0 '' , `` state 1 '' , ",
    "`` state @xmath1 '' , and the result `` do nt know '' .",
    "the constraint is that the measurement results should never wrongly identify a state , and the goal is to keep the fraction of `` do nt know '' results as low as possible .",
    "this problem has been investigated by ivanovic @xcite for the case of two equal probable non - orthogonal states .",
    "peres @xcite solved this problem in a formulation with probability operator measures ( pom ) . later jaeger and shimony @xcite extended the solution to arbitrary a priori probabilities .",
    "peres s solution has been generalized to an arbitrary number of equally probable states which are generated from each other by a symmetry operator by chefles and barnett @xcite . their result can be summarized as follows : the symmetry allows to write the input states in the form @xmath2 where the states @xmath3 represent some set of orthonormal states .",
    "note that the states @xmath4 form another orthonormal set .",
    "it turns out that the optimal strategy for unambiguous state discrimination consists of two steps . in the first step a filter operation",
    "is performed such that the output states are either the orthonormal states @xmath5 or some linear dependent states .",
    "this step can be described by a complete positive map with the two kraus operators .",
    "they are defined with the help of the minimum coefficient @xmath6 as @xmath7 the conditional state in the event of successful filtering is now given as @xmath8    in a second step , we can perform a von neumann projection measurement on this state to identify unambiguously the state @xmath9 via the orthonormal state @xmath10 .",
    "the probability of this successful identification is given by @xmath11 for the case of two equal probable non - orthogonal polarization states of a single photon a quantum optical implementation following this two - step idea has been given by huttner et al .",
    "@xcite and by brandt @xcite .",
    "a first description of realistic signal states is that of a coherent state with a small amplitude @xmath12 .",
    "this corresponds to the description of a dimmed laser pulse .",
    "the coherent state is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the creation operator for one of the four bb84 polarizations which can be expressed in terms of two creation operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( corresponding , e.g. , to two linear orthogonal polarizations ) as @xmath17 in terms of these two modes the signal state become therefore @xmath18 we can calculate the values of the @xmath19 in terms of the overlaps of the four states according to the formula @xcite @xmath20 { \\langle\\psi_k|\\psi_\\ell \\rangle}\\ ] ] and find as a function of the expected photon number @xmath21 @xmath22 the minimum of these four functions depends on the value of @xmath23 .",
    "the four functions @xmath24 are plotted in fig .  [ f-1 ] from where we can read off @xmath25 as the minimum .",
    "it turns out , however , that for realistic sources these states are not the correct description of the situation .",
    "the reason is that eve does not have a phase reference , that means that for a given polarization she does not see the coherent state @xmath26 but the phase averaged density matrix @xmath27 .",
    "this results in signal states which are mixtures of fock states with a poissonian photon number distribution described by the density matrix @xmath28 here the state @xmath29 denotes the fock state with @xmath30 photons in one of the four bb84 polarization states . the optimal strategy to discriminate between the four possible density matrices",
    "can be logically decomposed into a qnd measurement on the total photon number in the modes @xmath31 and @xmath32 together and a following measurement which unambiguously discriminates between the four resulting conditional states for each total photon number .",
    "the justification for this is that the total photon number via the qnd measurement `` comes free '' , since the execution of this measurement does not change the signal states .",
    "however , given the resulting information , we know the optimal strategy on the conditional states according to @xcite . therefore we find that the total probability of unambiguous state discrimination @xmath25 is given in terms of the respective probabilities for each photon number subspace @xmath33 as @xmath34 the conditional states resulting from the qnd measurement and corresponding to @xmath30 photons in total satisfy again the symmetry condition which allows to apply the results by chefles and barnett .",
    "we find for the four coefficients ( as a function of the photon number @xmath35 ) the expressions @xmath36 therefore the maximum probability of unambiguous state discrimination for fixed value of @xmath30 is given by @xmath37 it is possible to sum up the contributions from different photon numbers from the poissonian distribution and we obtain the expression @xmath38    this result is compared to the result for coherent states in fig .",
    "[ f0 ] .",
    "as expected , the probability for unambiguous state identification is lower for the mixture of fock - states than for the coherent states .",
    "an expansion in terms of the photon number @xmath23 gives @xmath39 for both situations .",
    "for lower than third order the signal states are not linearly independent , so that no unambiguous state discrimination is possible . note that an actual implementation does not necessarily need to follow the decomposition into a qnd and another measurement .",
    "we just need to implement one generalized measurement .",
    "actually , bennett et al .",
    "@xcite and yuen @xcite gave a simple beam - splitter setup which obtains a discrimination probability of @xmath40 .",
    "we now consider the realistic situation that alice uses the phase - averaged coherent states as signal states which are described by a poissonian photon number distribution with mean photon number @xmath23 . in this scenario",
    "we fix our eavesdropping strategy , to which we refer as the _ unambiguous state discrimination attack _ ( usd  attack ) as follows : the unambiguous state discrimination allows eve to identify a fraction of the signals without error . for this fraction , she can prepare a corresponding state close to bob s detectors such that no errors appear for these signals .",
    "whenever the identification does not succeed , she sends the vacuum signal to bob to avoid errors , which therefore will not be relevant in the considered scenario .",
    "we need to study this strategy under realistic constraint .",
    "an important constraint is that the transmittance of the quantum channel connecting both parties is given by the transmission efficiency @xmath41 .",
    "we consider a detection setup where bob monitors each polarization mode in the chosen basis by one detector .",
    "these detectors have a finite detection efficiency @xmath42 , in which we include any additional loss on bob s side , e.g.  from a polarizing beamsplitter .",
    "the detectors are modeled as `` yes / no '' detectors , which either fire , or they do not fire ; they can not distinguish the number of impinging photons .",
    "it is clear that once eve identified a signal she is interested to produce a signal in the corresponding polarization such that bob will detect it despite his inefficient detectors .",
    "one strategy is to send a stronger signal than the original one in the correct polarization .",
    "this will work as long as bob measures in the polarization basis which includes the signal polarization ( sifted key ) , but it will lead to an increased coincidence rate of clicks in both of bob s detectors otherwise .",
    "our analysis extends previous analysis to include the additional constraint put on the eavesdropping strategy by the fact that bob observes not only the rate of clicks of one or the other detector , but also the rate of events when both detectors fire , each monitoring one of the orthogonal polarization modes .",
    "the latter event will be observed ideally only when alice and bob use different bases , independently of the presence of absence of an eavesdropper .",
    "eve s aim is to reproduce these two observables with the minimum number of non - vacuum signals to make efficient use of the successfully identified signals .    in the absence of eve ,",
    "whenever alice and bob use the same polarization basis bob s expects to find at most one detector clicks ; the probability of a click is @xmath43 as follows from the poissonian photon - number statistics of coherent states .",
    "whenever alice and bob use different bases a double - click may occur ; its probability is @xmath44 ^ 2 .",
    "\\label{p2bar}\\ ] ]    what happens in the presence of eve depends on the signals eve sends for the successfully detected alice s signals .",
    "it is clear that eve can avoid the occurrence of double clicks when alice and bob measure in the same basis , since she unambiguously determined the signal .",
    "therefore it is not useful to monitor the double click rate when alice and bob use the same basis .",
    "note that we do not need to include detector dark count rates or errors due to misalignment into account .",
    "the reason for that is that we will investigate the limit when the usd   attack gives complete information to eve while it reproduces the expected probabilities @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the values of these probabilities in the absence of an eavesdropper and the reproduced values resulting from a successful usd   attack will be affected in the same way by the error mechanisms of dark counts and misalignment etc .",
    ", so that the resulting real observed rates will still be indistinguishable .",
    "let us suppose now , that whenever eve succeeds in the unambiguous state discrimination she sends a number state ( with correct polarization ) containing @xmath0 photons to bob .",
    "if she fails she simply sends no photon .",
    "if alice and bob use the same basis , at most one of two bob s detectors will click .",

    "\\label{p2}\\ ] ]      of course , there is no reason to restrict eve only to the use of number states .",
    "after successful state discrimination she can send to bob any pure state or mixture . however , from bob s point of view these signals are effectively mixtures of photon number states because of the nature of his detectors ( they may be described by the pair of projectors : @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) . therefore it is sufficient to analyze only a mixture of photon number states in the polarization of the identified signal , so that only the photon number statistics remains to be chosen by eve .",
    "as already mentioned , bob is interested only in the number of single clicks ( in case that his and alice s bases coincide ) and double clicks ( if the bases differ ) .",
    "one can plot very illustrative diagram displaying relations between corresponding single - click and double - click probabilities ( see fig .",

    "as we can see , this condition is satisfied in all current experiments and does not pose a serious restriction to the validity of our analysis especially for non negligible loss .",
    "now let us turn our attention to the condition ( [ cond2 ] ) which , whenever condition ( [ mucond ] ) is fulfilled , determines whether the working point is in the region of insecurity .",
    "it can be expressed in the following form @xmath87 due to the complicated dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath23 we failed to find its analytical solution .",
    "the analytical statement we can do without any extra approximation is based on the observation that @xmath88 this implies that there exists always a range of values for @xmath23 starting from @xmath89 for which we have @xmath90 , i.e.  the security of the key distribution can not be cracked completely by the usd  attack .",
    "it is easy to evaluate condition ( [ fcond ] ) numerically . in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] we give an example for the values of line transmittance @xmath91 and detection efficiency @xmath92 ( so that @xmath93 ) . in this particular case ,",
    "the transmission becomes insecure in about 2.07 photons .",
    "it is not completely satisfying to have to fall back to numerical methods to investigate the security against the usdattack .",
    "fortunately , it is possible to get some analytic results in a situation which is relevant to applications .",
    "the results of the previous sections illuminate to which extend eve can achieve perfect eavesdropping by making an unambiguous state discrimination measurement followed by sending the identified signals directly to bob s detectors , thereby bypassing the lossy quantum channel .",
    "however , eve does not necessarily need to access the whole lossy quantum channel to be successful . by accessing we mean ,",
    "that eve can avoid these losses either by replacing a quantum channel by a perfect , loss - free one , or by replacing it by classical communication and state preparation .",
    "the formulas of the previous sections still apply if we collect in the quantity @xmath42 all those losses on the way to bob s detector which are not accessible to eve , while @xmath41 denotes now only that loss that is accessible to her .",
    "it is instructive to look at the limit of high non - accessible losses ( @xmath94 ) . in that case",
    "we can approximate the function @xmath95 of equation ( [ fcond ] ) by @xmath96 the insecurity criterion @xmath97 in the region @xmath98 ( from eqn .",
    "( [ mucond ] ) ) then leads to the condition @xmath99 which is independent of @xmath42 .",
    "it can be approximated by @xmath100    condition ( [ etacond ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ usdadd ] as a solid line . to make statements about security against the usd  attack , we need to consider additionally condition ( [ mucond ] ) , which can be approximated by @xmath101 in leading order of @xmath42 and",
    "is shown as a dashed line .",
    "we now can conclude that the system is secure against usd  attacks in the regime of small detection efficiencies @xmath42 if we are in the parameter region with @xmath90 and @xmath98 .",
    "furthermore , the system is insecure in the region @xmath97 and @xmath98 . for the region with @xmath102 we can only make indirect statements .",
    "one is , that if the system is secure for a pair of values @xmath103 , then it must be secure for all values @xmath104 with @xmath105 , otherwise eve could gain an advantage by not accessing all the loss available to her .",
    "therefore the only region about which we can not make a statement with the present calculation is the region with @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "here more detailed calculation would be necessary .",
    "note that these considerations are valid for @xmath94 and only in this limit @xmath42 does no longer play any role . for higher values of @xmath42",
    "this changes .",
    "one should keep in mind that all of bob s measurements have a statistical character .",
    "bob does not measure probabilities but finite numbers of clicks which naturally fluctuates . in practice bob must set certain limits of a `` confidential interval '' of acceptable numbers of detector clicks .",
    "this effects that in some cases bob will reject the transmission even if no eavesdropper is present .",
    "a more serious implication is that there is always some non - zero probability that eve will not be detected even if the working point lies outside the insecurity region .",
    "note that eve does not need to eavesdrop all the time ",
    "she may let pass a fraction of the signal sequence without any intervention .",
    "her ( deterministic ) information on the key decreases with this strategy . but both bob s single- and double - click probabilities also change . the point corresponding to such an eavesdropping strategy ( in the diagram as in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) shifts along the straight line connecting `` full - time '' eve s strategy point with alice s and bob s working point .",
    "the relative shift equals the fraction of transmission during which eve is active .    for practical purposes it would be necessary to determine the probability that eve s information on the key ( due to the usd  attack ) will be smaller than a certain chosen limit , as a function of the limits of the confidential interval and of the length of the key",
    "this represents a challenge for the further research in this field .",
    "traditionally , security against the beamsplitting attack @xcite has been used as a practical level of security . in the beamsplitting attack",
    "the lossy line is replaced by an ideal loss - free line complemented by a beamsplitter such that the total loss of the original line is reproduced .",
    "the eavesdropper stores any photons coming out of the free arm of the beamsplitter .",
    "whenever the eavesdropper _ and _ the receiver obtain a photon , which is possible for multi - photon signals , eve can measure her signal after she learns the polarization basis in the public announcement and she will learn thereby the bit value of these signals completely .",
    "it is interesting to note that security against beamsplitting attack suggests that one can obtain a secure key even for large average photon numbers . in the absence of errors , the gain rate of secure key bits per signal bit can be approximated in a way similar to that used in @xcite for the optimal individual attack .",
    "this approximation is given by @xmath108 where the factor @xmath109 stems from discarding signals with unequal polarization basis .",
    "then @xmath110 is the probability that bob receives a signal , while @xmath111 is the joint probability that eve learned the bit value of a signal and that the signal is received by bob . to point out the basic problem of the beamsplitting attack it is sufficient to consider the case of @xmath112 and of coherent states .",
    "then we find for poissonian photon statistics and a transmission rate @xmath113 of the system @xmath114\\right\\},\\\\ g_{\\rm bs } & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-(1-\\eta ) \\mu ) \\left[1-\\exp(-\\eta \\mu ) \\right ]   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is always positive .",
    "actually , the optimum is obtained for @xmath115 .",
    "it is clear from our analysis , however , that for large values of @xmath23 and typical loss rates , the usd   attack will render the quantum key distribution protocol completely insecure .",
    "the awareness of this problem is low , and it is thought that it can be avoided by complementing the beamsplitting attack with the additional requirement to keep the average photon number low , much lower than @xmath73 , as to keep the set - up in the quantum domain .",
    "this seems rather odd , since there is no obvious justification for this requirement .",
    "more importantly , even for photon numbers @xmath116 we find that for sufficiently large loss the transmission becomes insecure according to the usd   attack while the analysis according to the beamsplitting attack makes us believe that we are dealing with a secure key .",
    "it seems that the usd   attack is underestimated since the probability of success in the unambiguous state discrimination goes with @xmath117 since only for three or more photons the four signal states are actually linear independent . the beamsplitting attack , however , succeeds with a probability of order @xmath118 , since already two photons can be split by the beamsplitter .",
    "this seems to imply that beamsplitting is the more powerful attack .",
    "however , this is not the case since the two attacks vary in their power differently as the loss of the system increases . in the usd   attack",
    "the probability to identify a signal depends only on the average photon number @xmath23 , and once this probability is high enough to generate the expected number of signals for the receiver ( which depends on the amount of loss ) then the transmission becomes insecure .",
    "in the beamsplitting attack , on the other hand , the total probability of identified signals @xmath111 depend on @xmath23 _ and _ on the transmission coefficient @xmath113 , and this probability goes _ down _ with increasing loss for fixed @xmath23 . and indeed , we find that @xmath119 .",
    "in other words , the beamsplitting attack becomes less efficient with increasing loss .",
    "this is easy to see in a simple example of a two - photon signal .",
    "the probabilities @xmath120 that @xmath121 photons arrive at bob s detectors and @xmath122 photons go to eve in the beamsplitting attack are given by @xmath123 this means , that for high losses ( @xmath124 ) most likely both photons are sent to eve .",
    "probability of this event is @xmath125 , while the splitting probability goes down as @xmath126 .",
    "the respective probabilities for @xmath30-photon signals are of the same order of magnitude in @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , clearly , there is a crossover as a function of @xmath113 where for fixed average photon number @xmath113 the usd   attack is more efficient than the beamsplitting attack .",
    "we would like to stress again that from a technological point of view the usd   attack seems to be easier to implement than the beamsplitting attack .",
    "this is based on two points .",
    "firstly , experience indicates that a complete measurements destroying the quantum state completely , as possible by the usd   attack , are easier to realize ( at least in some approximation ) than the realization of a quantum channel with reduced loss , as required by the beamsplitting attack .",
    "secondly , the beamsplitting attack implies the use of quantum memory , which could store the split - off signal photons until the polarization bases for each signal are announced .",
    "finally we would like to point out again that a security proof for realistic signals with poissonian photon number distribution exists for individual attacks @xcite and coherent attacks @xcite .",
    "naturally , these security proofs include the security against the beamsplitting attack and against the usd   attack .",
    "we have quantitatively analyzed an attack against realistic quantum crypto systems which enables an eavesdropper to gain information on the key without causing any errors in case of a lossy channel or poor detection efficiencies .",
    "it uses unambiguous discrimination of linearly independent signal states",
    ". this attack does not require the ability to store quantum states or to perform complicated quantum dynamics .",
    "moreover , the attack does not require to substitute the lossy quantum channel by a perfect one .",
    "we have derived a set of conditions which allow to judge whether a given system can be totally insecure under the usd   attack .",
    "we have shown a secure parameter regime in terms of the total transmission efficiency and the mean photon number . in the important limit of small detection efficiencies",
    "@xmath42 we have obtained an analytic result so that we can give explicitly a set of parameters ( line transmittances , detector efficiencies and mean photon numbers in coherent states sent by alice ) for which the transmission is secure / insecure under the usd   attack . in theory , the signal can always be chosen to be weak enough to allow secure communication . in practice , however , the detector noise places restrictions on that end @xcite .",
    "finally , we showed that security against beamsplitting attacks does not necessarily imply security against the usd   attack .",
    "this implies that we need to search for a better conditional security criterion against attacks deemed practically with currently available technology .",
