    "collisionless shocks form ubiquitously in tenuous cosmic plasmas via collective , electromagnetic viscosities .",
    "the formation process of such shocks inevitably produces suprathermal particles in addition to thermal particles with maxwellian velocity distributions @xcite .",
    "these nonthermal particles can be further accelerated to very high energies through the interactions with resonantly scattering alfvn waves in the converging flows across a shock , by diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) @xcite .",
    "detailed nonlinear treatments of dsa predict that a small fraction of incoming thermal particles can be injected into the cr population , and that a significant fraction of the shock kinetic energy can be transferred to crs @xcite .",
    "simulations of dsa in spherical supernova remnants ( snrs ) indicate that crs can absorb up to 50% of the initial blast energies @xcite .",
    "support for rapid and efficient dsa in that setting has been provided by recent x - ray observations of young snrs such as sn1006 and cas a that indicate the presence of short - lived , tev electrons emitting nonthermal synchrotron emission immediately inside the outer snr shock @xcite . on a galactic scale",
    "it is well known that the cr energy density is comparable to the gas thermal energy density in the interstellar medium and plays important dynamical roles in the evolution of our galaxy .",
    "although the galactic crs are commonly believed to be accelerated mostly at snr shocks , cr acceleration is probably important in all shock - heated astrophysical plasmas .",
    "cr populations are also indicated by extended , diffuse nonthermal emissions in some galaxy clusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "one likely contribution to that cr population is large scale shocks associated with the formation of the clusters . according to hydrodynamic simulations of large scale structure formation in the universe ,",
    "nonlinear structures such as pancakes , filaments , and knots are surrounded by `` external '' accretion shocks and contain complex webs of `` internal '' flow shocks including , but not limited to , accretion shocks around individual clusters and merger shocks inside clusters @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the characteristics of such cosmic shocks and showed that they have a wide range of physical parameters with shock speeds , @xmath5 , up to @xmath6 , preshock temperatures of @xmath7 k , and mach numbers up to a few 100 .",
    "they showed that in the present universe the mass inside nonlinear structures has been shocked approximately twice on average over cosmic time , and that shocks with @xmath8 have contributed @xmath9 of the total energy dissipated at the shocks . utilizing nonlinear dsa model calculations of @xcite",
    ", ryu estimated that the ratio of cr energy to gas thermal energy resulting from dissipation at cosmological shocks is @xmath10 .",
    "hence , the cr energy density could be dynamically important in the intracluster medium , just as in the interstellar medium of our galaxy and might have had some dynamical influences on large scale structure formation .",
    "the above `` cosmic structure shocks '' are an inevitable consequence of gravitational collapse , and are central to virialization of diffuse baryonic matter .",
    "the dsa process behind our present discussion depends , of course , on the existence of a magnetic field in the shock vicinity to mediate alfvnic turbulence that scatters the crs .",
    "the effectiveness of the scattering at a particular particle momentum , @xmath11 , can be expressed in terms of the dsa diffusion time , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the spatial diffusion coefficient , @xmath14 is the particle gyroradius , @xmath15 is the magnetic field , and @xmath16 characterizes the magnitude of resonant wave magnetic fields .",
    "particles will generally be accelerated from low energies to @xmath17 on timescales a few times @xmath18 ( see equation [ tacc ] ) .",
    "efficient transfer of kinetic energy to crs typically becomes apparent in dsa simulations by the time transrelativistic crs are accelerated , establishing the relevant time scale for the introduction of nonlinear feedback into the shock dynamics .",
    "evidence is strong that magnetic fields exist in clusters at levels exceeding at least a few @xmath19gauss @xcite .",
    "fields of that strength lead , with bohm diffusion ( @xmath20 ) , to diffusion times for transrelativistic crs , @xmath21 of the order of a few years for @xmath22 in fast cosmic shocks with speeds @xmath23 .",
    "direct evidence for microgauss - level magnetic fields where most cosmological shocks form , that is , outside individual clusters , is currently quite limited .",
    "however , there are good reasons to expect fields adequate for efficient dsa in most cosmic shocks . for example , even in the absence of any primordial seed field , magnetic fields are likely to be spontaneously generated at `` external cosmic shocks '' by some combination of the biermann battery @xcite and the weibel instability @xcite .",
    "whether such seed fields are initially strong enough to reduce diffusion times to cosmologically interesting values or not , quasi - linear plasma theory and simulations show that the streaming motion of suprathermal particles can induce resonant alfvn wave generation and strong field amplification upstream of collisionless shocks @xcite . @xcite have argued that magnetic fields can ultimately be amplified to produce magnetic pressures that are a substantial fraction of the ram pressure through the shock , @xmath24 .",
    "that limit would correspond to field strengths @xmath25gauss , where @xmath26 is the hubble parameter in units of 100 km / sec / mpc , @xmath27 is the local overdensity ratio , @xmath28 is the redshift of the epoch , and @xmath29 is the shock speed in units of @xmath30 .",
    "a baryon density fraction , @xmath31 , is assumed .",
    "even magnetic fields only one percent of this value would be sufficient to accelerate crs to relativistic energies , and , hence establish nonlinear cr feedback on timescales of thousands of years in the shocks of interest .    once shocks develop nonlinear properties in response to cr feedback , there are several important characteristics that distinguish them from more familiar gasdynamic shocks : 1 ) cr shocks continue to evolve over relatively long times and broaden as they do so . while full thermalization takes place instantaneously at a simple , discontinuous jump in an `` ideal ''",
    "gasdynamic shock , cr acceleration and the corresponding modifications to the underlying flow depend on suprathermal particles passing back and forth diffusively across the shock structure .",
    "these processes develop , therefore , on the diffusion time scale , @xmath32 , and diffusion length scale , @xmath33 , as alluded to earlier .",
    "generally , these scales are expected to be increasing functions of particle momentum , so cr acceleration and shock evolution rates slow over time .",
    "for very high energy particles dsa time and length scales often approach the age and the radius of curvature of astrophysical shocks .",
    "2 ) cr diffusion upstream of the shock discontinuity leads to strong pressure gradients in a shock precursor , enhancing the total compression through the shock transition over that in the `` viscous '' subshock .",
    "the total compression through a high - mach - number cr shock can greatly exceed the canonical value @xmath34 for strong gasdynamical shocks @xcite ( where @xmath35 is the gas adiabatic index ) .",
    "3 ) both the effective compressibility of the combined thermal - cr plasmas and the mean cr diffusion coefficient increase over time as relativistic crs absorb more energy and as escaping crs remove energy from the shock structure .",
    "details of these properties depend on the cr momentum distribution . thus",
    ", downstream states of the cr modified shock can not be found from simple  shock jump conditions \" , but rather have to be integrated time - dependently from given initial states or , for steady solutions , found in terms of some predefined limits to the cr spectrum ( an upper momentum cutoff ) .",
    "4 ) energy transfer to the crs rather than to the thermalized gas in the shock transition reduces the downstream thermal energy of a cr modified shock compared to a gasdynamic shock with the same shock speed and mach number .",
    "the mach number of the gas subshock is also reduced . even in a shock with a very large total mach number ,",
    "the subshock mach number and compression ratio are typically @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "in order to study these processes closely we recently developed a numerical scheme that self - consistently incorporates a thermal leakage cr injection model based on the analytic , nonlinear calculations of @xcite @xcite and implemented it into a combined adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) gas dynamics and cr diffusion - convection code @xcite .",
    "as described in the following section , there is only one rather well constrained parameter needed to express this injection model ; namely , the strength of nonlinear mhd waves immediately downstream of the plasma subshock with respect to the upstream longitudinal magnetic field strength .",
    "previously , we applied our new code to a preliminary investigation of cosmic shocks emerging in large scale structure formation of the universe @xcite . utilizing the bohm diffusion model in 1d quasi - parallel , plane - parallel shocks we showed that the resulting cr modified shocks evolve roughly `` self - similarly '' if the shock structure is expressed in terms of diffusion time and length scales , and that the time asymptotic states depend mainly on the shock mach number , with only a weak dependence on the parameter needed in the injection model .",
    "we found for strong shocks that about @xmath37 of incoming thermal particles are injected into the cr population with our thermal leakage injection model over the long term , and up to @xmath9 of the shock kinetic energy flux measured in the initial shock frame is transferred to crs . in the present contribution",
    "we confirm and extend our previous studies by including simulations of shock models with a broader range of physical parameters suitable for application to cosmic structure formation shocks , and also by including the influence of a pre - existing , upstream cr population , since many of the shocks of interest will probably form in previously shocked plasma .",
    "our numerical simulations here are limited to quasi - parallel shocks in which the mean magnetic field lines are parallel to the direction of shock propagation .",
    "in quasi - planar shocks this is not a strong limitation so long as the obliquity of the magnetic field is small enough to keep its intersection subluminal and so long as the magnetic field is too weak to be dynamically important @xcite .",
    "in addition , since streaming motions inside cosmic sheets and filaments appear to stretch the field lines @xcite , many structure formation `` internal '' shocks are likely to be quasi - parallel",
    ". the principle concern may be the influence of obliquity on the injection of low energy crs at the shocks , as we discuss below .    in the following section we briefly outline our numerical methods in the cr / amr hydrodynamics code .",
    "the simulation results are presented and discussed in  3 , followed by a summary in  4 .",
    "our conservative , eulerian cr / amr hydrodynamics code , crash ( cosmic - ray amr shock ) , solves the gasdynamic equations with cr pressure terms added for one dimensional plane - parallel geometry , along with the diffusion - convection equation for the cr momentum distribution function , @xmath38 .",
    "the full cr shock transition includes a very wide range of length scales associated with the particle diffusion lengths that must be resolved to follow the shock evolution properly . to include crs injected by thermal leakage",
    ", these scales must extend down close to the subshock thickness . in order to handle this dynamic range efficiently , an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) technique",
    "is applied to regions around gasdynamic shocks , which are tracked as discontinuous jumps by a front - tracking method @xcite .",
    "an additional equation for the `` modified entropy '' , @xmath39 , is solved to follow accurately the adiabatic changes outside of shocks , particularly in the precursor region of strong shocks @xcite .",
    "readers are referred to these previous papers for further numerical details .",
    "dsa , along with the time and length scales for cr acceleration , and subsequent shock modification , depend on the spatial diffusion coefficient for the crs .",
    "the diffusion coefficient can be expressed in terms of a mean scattering length , @xmath40 , as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the particle velocity . as noted earlier , for alfvn wave scattering one can write @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the bohm diffusion model , representing a saturated wave spectrum ( @xmath44 ) and the minimum diffusion coefficient , gives @xmath45 .",
    "if we assume `` bohm - like '' diffusion with @xmath46 with @xmath47 , the diffusion coefficient can be expressed as @xmath48 where hereafter momentum , @xmath49 , is expressed in units of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , represents the diffusion coefficient far upstream of the shock for crs with @xmath52 .",
    "the assumed density dependence for @xmath53 accounts for compression of the perpendicular component of the wave magnetic field and also inhibits the acoustic instability in the precursor of highly modified cr shocks @xcite .",
    "also , hereafter , we use the subscripts 0 , 1 , and 2 to denote conditions far upstream of the shock , immediately upstream of the gas subshock and immediately downstream of the subshock , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath54 represents the far - upstream gas density .",
    "the so - called dsa diffusion time , @xmath55 , defined in the introduction represents the time scale for hydrodynamical advection across the cr diffusion length , @xmath56 , which , in turn represents the length on which cr diffusion upstream is balanced by advection towards the subshock . conveniently , @xmath32 also provides a natural time unit to measure the acceleration time for individual crs .",
    "the residence time for individual particles on each side of the shock is proportional to @xmath57 , while the cr fractional momentum gain per shock crossing pair is proportional to @xmath58 .",
    "the resulting acceleration time scale for a particle to reach momentum @xmath49 @xcite is defined as @xmath59 the approximate , mach - number - based expression in equation ( [ tacc ] ) is based on the compression through a gasdynamic shock for @xmath60 and sets @xmath61 . once again , @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the cr acceleration time depends on both the speed and the mach number ( actually compression ) of the shock in addition to the diffusion coefficient . in the limit of strong shocks ( @xmath63 ) , however , it becomes independent of the shock mach number , and is about an order of magnitude greater than the nominal diffusion time , @xmath64 .",
    "we note , however , that in cr modified shocks the compression factor across the total shock structure can be greater than that of strong gasdynamic shocks , and that higher energy crs with greater diffusion length see a greater compression ratio .",
    "consequently , the mean acceleration timescale at a fixed cr energy is somewhat smaller than that given in equation ( [ tacc ] ) .      in the `` thermal leakage '' model for cr injection at shocks ,",
    "most of the downstream thermal protons are locally confined by nonlinear mhd waves and only particles well into the tail of the postshock maxwellian distribution can leak upstream across the subshock @xcite . in particular , `` leaking '' particles not only must have velocities large enough to swim against the downstream flow in order to return across the shock , they must avoid being scattered by the mhd waves that mediate the plasma subshock . the latter effect further strongly filters particles against leaking .",
    "thus , the ratio of the breadth of the postshock thermal velocity distribution to the downstream flow velocity in the subshock rest - frame is central to the injection problem .",
    "@xcite and @xcite developed a nonlinear analytic model to incorporate these features , and we have adapted that model to our simulations . in order to model this injection process numerically @xcite constructed a `` transparency function '' , @xmath65 that expresses the probability of supra - thermal particles at a given velocity , @xmath42 , leaking upstream through the postshock mhd waves .",
    "one free parameter , defined by @xcite , controls this function ; namely , @xmath66 , which is the ratio of the amplitude of the postshock mhd wave turbulence @xmath67 to the general magnetic field aligned with the shock normal , @xmath68 .",
    "as noted by @xcite this parameter is rather well constrained , since @xmath69 is indicated for strong parallel shocks .",
    "however , such large values of @xmath70 lead to very efficient initial injection and most of the shock energy is quickly transferred to the cr component for strong shocks of @xmath71 @xcite , causing a numerical problem at the very early stage of simulations .",
    "consequently , we reduced the shock transparency by setting @xmath72 in this study .",
    "@xcite showed that time asymptotic states of the cr shocks depend only weakly on the values of @xmath70 in this range . on the other hand",
    ", smaller @xmath70 values may also be more in tune with behaviors in moderately oblique shocks , since finite magnetic field obliquity also reduces shock transparency and the rate of thermal injection @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite estimate that the injection rate for angles @xmath73 falls below the critical injection rate for efficient shock modification , @xmath74 ( as defined in equation [ xieq ] ) , and cr acceleration becomes very inefficient .",
    "the ideal gasdynamic equations in 1d planar geometry do not contain any intrinsic time and length scales , but in cr modified shocks the cr acceleration and the precursor growth can be characterized by the diffusion scales , @xmath18 and @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath76 provides a useful canonical value , since nonlinear feedback from crs to the underlying flow becomes significant typically by the time transrelativistic crs are accelerated .",
    "consequently , we normalize our shock evolution times and structure scales by @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , respectively , where @xmath79 is a characteristic flow speed .",
    "one expects intrinsic similarities in the dynamic evolution and structure of two cr shock models with the same mach number , but with different shock speeds , _",
    "so long as the results are expressed in terms of @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "_ this approach removes the need for any particular choice in @xmath82 , but we note for convenience that @xmath83 , where @xmath84 . then for example , a characteristic diffusion time , @xmath85 sec , and @xmath86 cm , where @xmath87 km / sec .    in the simulations described below",
    "we express pressures and energy densities in units @xmath88 , where @xmath89 will be an appropriate fiducial gas density .",
    "again , for reference , we can express these quantities in practical units in terms of the preshock cosmic overdensity ratio , @xmath90 , as @xmath91 and @xmath92 , with the same cosmological choices mentioned in the introduction .",
    "when the shock speeds are less than a percent or so of the speed of light , freshly injected crs are essentially nonrelativistic ( @xmath93 ) , so both the diffusion coefficient and cr partial pressure take power law forms ; thus , allowing self - similar behaviors in modified shock evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "once the shock speed exceeds a percent or so of the speed of light , the full expression for the particle speed , @xmath94 , must be applied , so neither the diffusion coefficient nor the cr partial pressure permit self - similar scalings .",
    "consequently , the physical shock speed does influence the evolution of the fastest shocks we simulated in this study .",
    "we model shocks that form in an accretion flow entering through the right boundary in a 1d simulation box,@xmath95 $ ] .",
    "the inflow has constant density , speed , and pressure .",
    "this flow reflects off the left boundary , or piston , to initiate the shock , which evolves in response to crs accelerated via dsa as it propagates to the right . with the normalization constants described above , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 in code units , where @xmath99 is the accretion flow mach number .",
    "the gas adiabatic index , @xmath100 .",
    "the shock normalization constants are set by two parameters , @xmath99 and @xmath101 , through @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the upstream sound speed of the accretion flow .",
    "we assume the preshock gas is fully ionized with a mean molecular weight , 0.61 .",
    "we do not include complexities due to interactions between neutral and ionized gas in our numerical treatment .",
    "we also ignore added energy transport processes such as radiative cooling , the diffuse radiation emitted by the shock - heated gas and thermal conduction .",
    "however , they should be included in future studies for more realistic model calculations .    for a gasdynamic shock with compression ratio , @xmath104 , the speed of the shock reflected from the piston is @xmath105 in the piston ( simulation ) frame and @xmath106 in the upstream flow frame .",
    "from this relation , the _ initial _ shock speed with respect to the upstream flow spans the range @xmath107 for accretion mach numbers , @xmath108 .",
    "however , as cr pressure builds in the shock precursor , the total compression through the shock increases , and the shock slows down .",
    "that is , the _ instantaneous _ shock speed , @xmath109 , relative to the accretion flow decreases over time . in addition , the gas subshock weakens as the flow is decelerated and heated in the precursor by the cr pressure gradient .",
    "we ran most simulations until time @xmath110 , which is generally sufficient to reach an approximate dynamical steady state , as discussed in  3 .",
    "several much longer simulations based on a new `` coarse grained momentum finite volume '' code in development have also been carried out to confirm the time asymptotic behaviors , as discussed in  3.5 .",
    "the simulated space is @xmath111 $ ] for @xmath112 and @xmath113 $ ] for @xmath114 with @xmath115 spatial zones on the base grid .",
    "the simulations were carried out on a base grid with @xmath116 using @xmath117 additional grid levels with a refinement of two , so @xmath118 at the finest grid level .",
    "the number of refined zones around the shock is @xmath119 on the base grid and so there are @xmath120 zones on each refined level . to avoid technical difficulties",
    "the amr technique is turned on and the cr injection and acceleration are activated only after the shock propagates to a half length of the pre - defined amr refinement region in the base grid .",
    "this initial delay of the cr injection and acceleration should not affect the final outcomes .",
    "for all models we use 230 uniformly spaced logarithmic momentum zones in the interval @xmath121=[-3.0,+3.0]$ ]    shocks formed by steady accretion flow onto cosmic structure pancakes provide a convenient prototype of our modeled shocks .",
    "we , therefore , refer to the upstream flows as `` accretion flows '' , and specify the flow speed and mach number with respect to the reflecting symmetry plane .",
    "the models are also applicable to other cosmic structure shocks associated with filaments , knots and individual clusters .",
    "in @xcite we considered a set of models with fixed infall speed , @xmath122 ( `` constant @xmath123 '' models ) , while the preshock temperature was varied according to @xmath124 with @xmath108 . in @xcite , on the other hand , we set the preshock temperature at @xmath125 k ( `` constant @xmath126 '' models ) , and varied the shock speeds according to @xmath127 , with @xmath128 .",
    "we now extend the study of @xcite to include higher preshock temperatures , and also to include the effects of pre - existing crs in the shock evolution .",
    "in particular we include : 1 ) @xmath129 k shocks without pre - existing crs , 2 ) @xmath125 k shocks with pre - existing crs , and 3 ) @xmath129 k shocks with pre - existing crs . for @xmath125",
    "k upstream conditions models with @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) are considered , while for @xmath129k conditions we include cases with @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "we note , for @xmath129k conditions , models with @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) would be relevant for cosmic structure shocks , but models with @xmath136 and 50 are included to explore the similarity issue discussed above in  2.4 . in determining these sets of model parameters , we considered the following factors . in astrophysical environments photoionized gas of @xmath137 k is quite common .",
    "for example , ly @xmath138 clouds and the intergalactic medium in cosmological sheets and voids are believed to be photoionized during the reionization epoch @xcite . also the preshock gas can be photoionized and heated to @xmath139 k by the diffuse radiation emitted by hot postshock gas when @xmath140 @xcite . on the other hand , hot and ionized gas of @xmath141 k",
    "is also found in the hot phase of the ism @xcite and in the intracluster medium of x - ray clusters @xcite .",
    "since cosmological simulations indicate that most diffuse plasma in large scale cosmic structures is likely to be shocked more than once during structure formation , it is likely that many `` internal shocks '' process plasma that carries previously accelerated crs .",
    "we , therefore , include shock simulations including these populations . for pre - existing , upstream crs we assumed a simple power - law spectrum smoothly connected to the upstream thermal maxwellian distribution ( @xmath142 ) at a momentum @xmath143 as @xmath144 for @xmath145 , where @xmath146 , @xmath147 . for @xmath125",
    "k shocks we considered in the pre - existing cr cases an upstream cr pressure condition , @xmath148 , using @xmath149 . for @xmath129 k shocks we included three different upstream conditions ; namely , @xmath148 ( @xmath150 ) , @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) and @xmath153 ( @xmath154 ) . the cr spectral forms represent test - particle populations for previous shocks with moderate mach numbers in the range , @xmath155 .",
    "table 1 provides a summary of the new models computed for the present study .",
    "it is useful to characterize the efficiency with which low energy crs are injected at the shocks .",
    "we define the injection efficiency as the fraction of particles that have entered the shock from far upstream and then injected into the cr distribution : @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the cr distribution function , @xmath158 is the particle number density far upstream , and @xmath159 is the time when the cr injection / acceleration is turned on ( @xmath160 for @xmath161 and @xmath162 for @xmath163 ) .    if the subshock speed becomes steady , then @xmath164 is the same as the particle flux swept by the subshock , @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the particle number density immediately upstream of the subshock .",
    "however , in our simulations these two flux measures can differ by up to 10% for strong shock models , because the shock speed is changing slowly .    as a measure of efficiency of cr energy extraction at shocks",
    ", we define the `` cr energy ratio '' , @xmath167 ; namely , the ratio of the total cr energy within the simulation box to the kinetic energy in the _ initial shock frame _ that has entered the simulation box from far upstream , @xmath168 all shock models have the same normalized upstream mass density and velocity , @xmath54 and @xmath123 , but different upstream gas thermal energy density , @xmath169 , depending on @xmath99 . therefore , we use the kinetic energy flux rather than the total energy flux to normalize the `` cr energy ratio '' .",
    "alternatively , the ratio defined with the total energy flux , @xmath170 $ ] , can be calculated from the following relation , @xmath171 where we assume @xmath172 for the preshock cr population .",
    "this shows that @xmath173 for large values of @xmath99 , while @xmath174 for @xmath163 and @xmath175 .",
    "we can define three key stages of shock evolution in response to cr feedback : 1 ) development of the shock precursor that slows and heats the flow entering the gas subshock , reducing the mach number of the latter ; 2 ) achievement of an _ approximately _ time - asymptotic dynamical shock transition , including nearly steady postshock cr and gas pressures ; 3 ) continued , approximately `` self - similar '' evolution of the shock structure for bohm - type diffusion , as crs are accelerated to ever higher momenta .",
    "once stage ( 3 ) is reached , there is little change in the dynamical properties of the shocks , and , in particular , little change in the total efficiency with which kinetic energy is transferred to crs .",
    "thus , given the rapidly increasing computational cost to simulate acceleration of crs to still higher energies with bohm diffusion ( which more than quadruples for each factor of two increase in maximum cr momentum ) , we deemed it sufficient to the questions being addressed to terminate the simulations at the times indicated .",
    "as @xcite showed , the evolution of cr modified shocks with bohm - type diffusion are mainly determined by the shock mach number for a given injection parameter .",
    "this includes the efficiency of energy transfer to crs , @xmath167 .",
    "that is , two shocks with the same mach number , but with different shock speeds evolve qualitatively similarly when expressed in terms of characteristic diffusion scales , @xmath176 and @xmath177 . during the early evolutionary stage ,",
    "however , the similarity between the two shocks may break down as pointed out in  2.4 .",
    "as described there , this happens if the shock speed is larger than a percent or so of the speed of light , on account of the different momentum - velocity scalings for nonrelativistic and relativistic particles at injection . as a result ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath178 increases faster and nonlinear modification sets in earlier in terms of @xmath179 in the shock with lower speed .",
    "thus , depending on when the transition from nonrelativistic to relativistic population occurs , early evolution of the two shocks can be different ( see @xmath136 models in figure 2 ) , although they still eventually approach similar time - asymptotic states .",
    "the other factor that can affect the similarity is the presence of pre - existing crs . for strong shocks of @xmath180 ,",
    "the preshock cr pressure is only a few percent of the total energy flux even when @xmath181 far upstream . in those cases",
    "the presence of pre - existing crs is effectively equivalent to having a slightly higher injection rate ( larger @xmath70 ) , which speeds up the initial shock evolution . for strong shocks",
    ", our previous studies have shown that the time asymptotic cr acceleration efficiency depends only weakly on the injection rate @xcite , provided the injection remains above a minimum threshold for `` efficient '' dsa ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , for weak shocks , a pre - existing cr pressure comparable to the upstream gas pressure represents a significant fraction of the total energy entering the shock , so pre - existing crs have far more impact .",
    "also the time asymptotic cr acceleration efficiency in weak shocks depends sensitively on the injection rate and increases with @xmath70 .",
    "hence we should expect that relatively weak cr shocks ( @xmath182 ) will be substantially altered by the presence of a finite upstream @xmath183 .",
    "figure 1 compares the time evolution of two cr modified shock models with accretion mach number @xmath184 , but with different physical flow speeds and upstream cr conditions .",
    "the light lines show the flow model with @xmath125 k and the pre - existing cr population , @xmath185 , while the heavy lines show the model with @xmath129 k and @xmath186 .",
    "the pressure due to the pre - existing cr particles is @xmath187 in both models .",
    "note that the physical time and length scales are different , since @xmath188 and @xmath189 ( @xmath190 for @xmath125 k models and @xmath191 for @xmath129 k models ) .    in the model with @xmath192 cr particles",
    "are injected at much lower injection momenta . since for a fixed mach number their initial acceleration times scale as @xmath193 , the acceleration and",
    "shock modification takes place more rapidly in these time units compared to the model with @xmath194 .",
    "the value of @xmath178 approaches 0.8 for the model with @xmath192 , while it approaches 0.65 for the model with @xmath194 .",
    "otherwise , the overall evolution is roughly similar .",
    "figure 2 shows that even for much higher mach numbers , @xmath136 , two shocks with @xmath195 and @xmath196 approach similar time - asymptotic states , although their early evolutions are very different .",
    "however , as the shock speed increases further , substantial differences develop in the early evolution . for @xmath197 models , for example , unlike the shocks shown in the figures , the overall shock structures then evolve much more slowly in our normalized time units , since the injection momentum is no longer nonrelativistic .",
    "then the bohm - like diffusion coefficient and the cr partial pressure near this momentum do not scale with @xmath198 as they do for nonrelativistic momenta .",
    "the approximate self - similarity of the shock evolution breaks down under those conditions .",
    "even those shocks , however , do approach similar time asymptotic states for a given mach number .",
    "the flow entering the piston is decelerated first by the precursor and then by the subshock in our simulation . for a pure gas fluid with a constant adiabatic index",
    ", the postshock flow speed relative to the piston should be uniformly zero .",
    "this should be approximately true for the models with inefficient cr acceleration in our simulations ( see , for example , fig.4 below ) . in cr modified shocks , however , the `` effective '' adiabatic index decreases due to increasing cr energy , so the total compression through the shock increases and the shock slows down over time .",
    "this transition in the compressibility of the flow leads to a net forward flow velocity of @xmath199 in the piston rest frame for the two models shown in figs . 1 and 2",
    "however , the net flow speed is decelerated by the positive gradient of the combined postshock pressure ( @xmath200 ) and approaches a smaller value ( @xmath201 ) at the terminal simulation time .    as noted in previous _ time - dependent _ studies",
    "( see the references in  1 ) , the compression factor for these cr dominated shocks relaxes to values still higher than that for a gasdynamic shock , even a for a fully relativistic gas , even though energy is not leaving the system in our simulations .",
    "the reason has to do with the _ evolving _ distribution of energy in the system .",
    "in particular , for a diffusion coefficient increasing with @xmath49 , especially for high mach number , cr dominated shocks , the compression factor can remain much higher than what is expected in a steady - state , energy - conserving shock jump for relativistic gas ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "this is because energy is being continuously transported out of the region of the subshock by diffusion of the highest energy crs with an ever - increasing diffusion scale @xmath203 ) .",
    "more extensive discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "figure 3 compares the evolution of shocks _ with _ and _ without _ pre - existing , upstream crs .",
    "four sets of shocks are illustrated : 1 ) @xmath184 , @xmath204 , and @xmath125 k ( upper left panel ) , 2 ) @xmath184 , @xmath205 , and @xmath129 k ( upper right panel ) , 3 ) @xmath136 , @xmath206 , and @xmath125 k ( lower left panel ) , and 4 ) @xmath136 , @xmath207 , and @xmath129 k ( lower right panel ) .",
    "the approximate self - similarity for the evolution of these shocks , when described in normalized units is apparent .",
    "in addition one can see that the presence of pre - existing crs is clearly more important for low mach number shocks .",
    "it is especially important to consider the influence of pre - existing crs in low mach number shocks , since internal shocks with @xmath208 may be the most important for dissipation in shock - heated gas inside nonlinear structures @xcite .",
    "we already know that cr acceleration efficiency in low to moderate strength shocks depends sensitively on the injection rate and increases with @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "our new simulations show that the cr acceleration efficiency in these shocks depends similarly on the pre - existing ( upstream ) cr pressure .",
    "that trend was apparent in figure 1 .",
    "figure 4 emphasizes the point impressively for even lower mach number shocks .",
    "it shows the time evolution of the models with accretion flow mach number @xmath163 and @xmath209 , which drive shocks with initial mach number of @xmath210 into the preshock gas with @xmath129 k. three models are compared in the figure : 1 ) a model with no pre - existing crs ( solid lines ) , 2 ) a model with @xmath211 ( dotted lines ) , and 3 ) a model with @xmath212 ( dashed line ) . for the model without the pre - existing crs and with injection parameter , @xmath72 , the cr injection is small and the resulting cr acceleration is inefficient .",
    "the solution is essentially a test - particle solution , with minimal cr modifications to the flow structure .",
    "there are a couple of related reasons for the impact of the upstream crs in the two other models .",
    "first , the pressure of the pre - existing crs can not be neglected in the shock transition compared to the total shock energy flux .",
    "in addition , the inflowing crs act like a large source of injected crs , effectively enhancing the injection rate ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite also considered similar @xmath163 models without the pre - existing crs ( @xmath122 , and @xmath213 k ) , but with a range of injection parameters , @xmath214 .",
    "we found that the postshock cr pressure increased over this range of @xmath70 from @xmath215 to @xmath216 , while the associated injection rate rose from @xmath217 to @xmath218 ( see figure 8 in * ? ? ?",
    "these results imply that even in low mach number shocks the cr acceleration can have significant dynamical influences , when the injection rate is as high as @xmath219 or when the upstream cr pressure is greater than a few times 10 % of the gas pressure",
    ". this could be important in the context of cosmic structure shocks , especially for `` internal shocks '' in which the upstream plasma already carried a significant population of crs produced in an earlier era .",
    "time evolution of the distribution function @xmath220 _ at the gas subshock _ is shown in figure 5 for the models with @xmath129 k and with @xmath185 .",
    "the dotted line shows the initial maxwellian distribution with @xmath126 and the specified power - law distribution for the pre - existing cr population .",
    "the postshock thermal distribution during the early evolution ( before shock modification ) should have @xmath221 , so the injection momentum , @xmath222 for @xmath223 .",
    "however , as energy transfer to crs increases over time and the gas subshock weakens , the peak in the maxwellian distribution shifts to lower momenta .",
    "the model with @xmath136 shows this effect clearly .",
    "this nonlinear feedback is greater for higher mach number , so that the postshock temperature of evolved cr modified shocks depends on @xmath99 much more weakly than the standard @xmath224 .",
    "it is useful to identify @xmath225 as the momentum above which @xmath226 drops sharply , characterizing the effective upper cutoff in the cr distribution , at a given time since shock formation .",
    "this momentum is generally easily identified .",
    "we find that it is approximately related to the age of the shock as @xmath227 for @xmath228 .",
    "this explains why values of @xmath225 are similar at a given value of @xmath179 for all models considered here , independent of @xmath79 , injection momentum , or shock mach number .",
    "the previously described back reaction of the crs on the gas subshock acts to move the shock towards a limiting form and postshock state . on the one hand",
    ", a fraction of cr particles injected at early times continues being accelerated to higher momenta , so that @xmath229 always increases until they are subject to escape due to geometry or insufficient scattering .",
    "on the other hand , particle injection becomes less efficient as the subshock feature weakens . because of this reduced source spatial diffusion causes the number density of crs near the subshock at a given momentum to decrease with time for any @xmath230 .",
    "combined , these effects cause the postshock cr pressure , @xmath183 , to approach a time - asymptotic value , and , for bohm - like diffusion , the shock structure to become approximately self - similar .",
    "figure 6 illustrates the time averaged injection efficiency , @xmath231 , defined by equation ( 9 ) for models without pre - existing crs .",
    "the calculated injection efficiency ranges from @xmath232 to @xmath233 , depending on the subshock mach number , the shock speed , and the injection parameter , @xmath70 . as outlined in  2.4 and",
    "discussed fully in @xcite , the modeled thermal - leakage injection process is less efficient for weaker subshocks and for smaller @xmath70 ( stronger wave trapping of suprathermal particles in the postshock environment ) .",
    "injection is also less efficient for lower shock speeds , because the diffusive flux of injected particles crossing the subshock is smaller for smaller injection momentum ( @xmath234 ) .",
    "so , for a given mach number the models with higher shock speed ( higher @xmath126 in figure 6 ) have larger values of @xmath231 . for strong shocks",
    "the subshock weakens significantly due to the cr nonlinear feedback , so the injection efficiency slowly decreases over time .",
    "figure 7 shows for the models with @xmath125k the cr energy ratio , @xmath167 , the cr pressure and the gas pressure at the subshock normalized by the far upstream ram pressure in the _ initial _ shock frame , @xmath235 , and @xmath236 .",
    "in addition the bottom panels show the cr pressure normalized by the far upstream ram pressure in the _ instantaneous _ shock frame , @xmath237 , the left panels illustrate the models without pre - existing crs , while right panels show the models with @xmath211 .",
    "as described in the previous subsection , the postshock @xmath183 for all mach numbers increases until a balance between injection / acceleration and advection / diffusion of crs is achieved . after that time , which corresponds in these simulations to the generation of moderately relativistic crs in the shock ,",
    "the postshock cr pressure remains almost steady .",
    "simultaneously , the cr energy ratio , @xmath167 , also initially increases with time , but then asymptotes to a constant value , once @xmath238 has reached a quasi - steady value .",
    "the asymptotic values result from the `` self - similar '' behavior of the @xmath239 distribution .",
    "since both the numerator and denominator in equation ( [ crenrat ] ) increase approximately linearly with time in the case of the self - similar evolution of @xmath240 , @xmath167 becomes steady when @xmath238 becomes constant .",
    "as illustrated in figure 7 , time - asymptotic values of @xmath167 increase with the accretion mach number @xmath99 , approaching @xmath241 for @xmath242 by the simulation termination times .",
    "as expected from the discussion in  3.4 , the presence of pre - existing crs increases the asymptotic postshock @xmath183 for the weaker shock , @xmath184 model , while it does not affect the strong shock models with @xmath243 .",
    "figure 7 also illustrates the well - known result that strong shocks can be mediated mostly by crs while the postshock gas thermal energy is reduced greatly compared to that in conventional gasdynamic shocks of the same mach number . as a result of nonlinear feedback",
    "the shock slows down and so the ratio of @xmath244 can reach @xmath245 , while the ratio of @xmath246 reaches @xmath247 in these models .",
    "in figure 8 we present the same quantities for the models with @xmath129k .",
    "as explained in the previous section , due to the higher injection momenta , the cr acceleration is slower to develop for the models with @xmath248 , compared to the same mach number model with lower shock speed . especially for the @xmath197 model , the postshock @xmath183 continues to increase at the termination time ( @xmath249 ) of the simulation .",
    "again , the presence of pre - existing crs significantly increases the postshock @xmath183 at low mach number models ( @xmath250 ) .",
    "we show the same quantities for low mach number simulations with even higher pre - existing @xmath183 in figure 9 .",
    "we see that the postshock @xmath183 increases with the pre - existing @xmath183 for these low mach number models .",
    "as discussed above , some characteristics of the cr modified shocks seem to have reached quasi - steady states well before the termination time for most of the models considered in this work .",
    "we have further explored these time asymptotic behaviors by performing much longer simulations with a new `` coarse - grained momentum finite volume '' ( cgm ) numerical scheme under development .",
    "cgm utilizes the fact that the distribution function can be approximated as a piecewise power - law within a given broad momentum bin and so only roughly one momentum bin per octave is necessary to follow the cr population numerically .",
    "details and tests of the cgm numerical method will be presented in a forthcoming paper @xcite . in figures 10 and 11",
    ", we show the simulation results of @xmath184 and @xmath136 models , respectively , which were calculated by this cgm method up to @xmath251 .",
    "no pre - existing crs were assumed and 14 momentum bins were used for these calculations .",
    "the heavy solid lines are for the simulation results at @xmath252 for the @xmath184 model and @xmath253 for the @xmath136 model which were calculated by the `` fine - grained momentum '' method described in  2 and used for all the other results presented in this paper .",
    "those simulations were carried out with 240 momentum bins .",
    "these figures confirm very firmly the aforementioned `` self - similarity '' of the shock evolution and the time - asymptotic behaviors .",
    "thus we show in figure 12 values of the cr energy ratio @xmath167 at the termination time as a function of the initial unmodified shock mach number , @xmath254 , as a simple measure of the cr acceleration efficiency . for convenience in comparing with other plots values of @xmath254",
    "are listed against @xmath99 in table 1 .",
    "flows with @xmath125 are shown in the upper panel , while shocks developed in @xmath129 flows are represented in the lower panel . for comparison , we also plotted in the upper panel results from `` constant @xmath123 '' models with @xmath255 and @xmath256 k , originally presented in figure 7 of @xcite . those models , which did not include a pre - existing cr population ,",
    "behave similarly to the new models considered in the present work . in each series of simulations the efficiency asymptotes to @xmath257 for large @xmath254 .",
    "this asymptotic efficiency is independent of @xmath258 ; the level of pre - existing crs .",
    "it also reflects the fact that the postshock cr pressures in the high mach number shocks evolve in all cases roughly to 60% of the inflowing ram pressure measured in the initial shock rest frame , @xmath259 . in weak",
    "to moderate strength shocks , on the other hand , the cr efficiencies shown in figure 12 , or the postshock cr pressures illustrated in figures 7 and 8 , depend strongly on @xmath258 .",
    "a rough dividing line for these two behavior domains is @xmath260 . for the @xmath210 model without the pre - existing crs and @xmath72 , the injection rate @xmath261 and @xmath167 approaches to only 0.04 . since @xmath69 is indicated for strong shocks @xcite and",
    "weaker wave fields are expected in lower mach shocks , leading to larger values of @xmath70 , we show three addition models for @xmath262 0.25 , 0.3 , and 0.4 with @xmath210 , @xmath213k and no pre - existing crs , originally presented in figure 8 of @xcite , in the upper panel of figure 12 . in @xcite the cr efficiency model , @xmath263 , for @xmath264 was adopted in the calculation of the cr energy generated by cosmic stricture shocks .",
    "we note that the functional minimum in @xmath263 for the models with pre - existing crs is an artifact of the definition of @xmath167 , which is normalized by the inflowing kinetic energy , not the total energy .",
    "the thermal energy flux is a significant fraction of the kinetic energy flux for low mach number shocks .",
    "there is no minimum in the function @xmath265 , as defined in equation [ crenprime ] .",
    "for instance the value @xmath266 shown in figure 12 , becomes @xmath267 .    as also pointed out in  3.2",
    ", the increases in cr energy ratio for weak shocks when they process plasma that contains pre - existing crs , could be important to understanding the properties of cosmic structure formation shocks .",
    "in addition , most baryonic matter in clusters has been shocked more than once before the current epoch @xcite .",
    "this means that many of the shocks primarily responsible for energy dissipation during structure formation may be influenced by crs accelerated in previous shock events , since magnetic field strengths at levels discussed in the introduction should tie crs up to moderately relativistic energies to the thermal plasma over cosmic time scales @xcite . in that case , those shocks may be substantially more efficient at cr acceleration than one might otherwise expect .",
    "energy dissipation at collisionless shocks involves complex physical processes and plays crucial roles in the evolution of shock - heated astrophysical plasmas . here",
    "our focus is cr acceleration via the first - order fermi process at cosmic shocks that form in and around nonlinear structures during the formation of large scale structure in the universe . using our cosmic - ray amr shock code @xcite ,",
    "we have calculated the cr acceleration at 1d quasi - parallel shocks driven by plane - parallel infall flows with @xmath268 and preshock temperatures of @xmath0k .",
    "mach numbers of the resulting shocks range over @xmath269 , which covers the characteristic shock mach numbers found in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of a @xmath270cdm universe @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this study is to explore how the cr acceleration efficiency at cosmic structure shocks depends on the preshock temperature , shock speed and pre - existing crs as well as shock mach number .",
    "this , in turn , affects the thermal and dynamical history of the shocked - heated baryon gas , since the energy transfer to crs reduces the thermal energy of the gas and increases the compressibility of the gas flow , much like radiative shocks .    unlike pure gasdynamic shocks",
    ", downstream states of the cr modified shocks can not be found from `` shock jump conditions '' , so they have to be integrated time - dependently from given initial states or found from nonlinear analytical methods .",
    "time - dependent simulations are computationally expensive , because the cr diffusion and acceleration processes contain a wide range of length and time scales . fortunately , there are approximate similarity properties that can be employed to study the time asymptotic behavior of evolved cr modified shocks when they are mediated by bohm - like diffusion .",
    "firstly , the cr pressure approaches a steady - state value in a time scale comparable to the acceleration time scales for mildly relativistic protons after which the evolution of cr modified shocks becomes approximately `` self - similar '' .",
    "this feature enables us to predict time asymptotic values of the cr acceleration efficiency , although we followed the cr acceleration up to only moderately relativistic energies ( @xmath271 ) .",
    "we have confirmed these time asymptotic behaviors through much longer simulations with a new , more efficient , numerical scheme @xcite , which were extended to achieve the cut - off momentum @xmath272 .",
    "secondly , _ two models with the same mach number , but with different accretion speeds _ show qualitatively similar evolution and structure when the dynamical evolution is presented in terms of characteristic diffusion scales , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "such similarities are only approximate , however , because the partial cr pressure and the bohm diffusion coefficient for transrelativistic crs do depend on the momentum @xmath273 .",
    "since the effective injection momentum is @xmath274 , the initial evolution depends on the shock speed as well as mach number .",
    "\\1 ) suprathermal particles can be injected efficiently into the cr population at quasi - parallel cosmic shocks via the thermal leakage process . for a given injection parameter defined in the text , @xmath70 , the fraction of injected crs increases with the subshock mach number , but approaches @xmath275 in the strong shock limit .",
    "\\2 ) for a given value of @xmath70 , the acceleration efficiency increases with the shock mach number , but approaches a similar value in the strong shock limit .",
    "time asymptotic values of the ratio of cr energy to inflowing kinetic energy , @xmath167 , converge to @xmath241 for @xmath71 and it is relatively independent of other upstream or injection parameters ( see figure 12 ) .",
    "thus , strong cosmic shocks can be mediated mostly by crs and the gas thermal energy can be up to @xmath276 times smaller than that expected for gasdynamic shocks .",
    "\\3 ) for weak shocks , on the other hand , the acceleration efficiency increases with the injection rate ( or @xmath70 ) and the pre - exiting @xmath183 ( see figure 12 ) . for cosmologically common @xmath210 shocks , for example , @xmath277 for @xmath72 and @xmath278 for @xmath264 in the absence of pre - existing crs .",
    "the presence of a pre - existing cr population acts effectively as a higher injection rate than the thermal leakage alone , leading to greatly enhanced cr acceleration efficiency in low mach number shocks .",
    "we found even for weak shocks of @xmath210 , that up to 40 % of the total energy flux through the shocks can be transferred to crs , when the upstream cr pressure is comparable to the gas pressure in the preshock flow .",
