    "for instance we refer to a training procedure based on iterative learning , or a working system based on replacements or repairs of failed items . starting from the sequence @xmath0",
    ", we derive some properties of new weighted cumulative distribution via stochastic orders , and its connection with covariance and cumulative entropy .",
    "our investigation is also devoted to disclose iterative rules that allow to compute the mean and the cumulative entropy of the random variables of the sequence , whose computational efficiency is illustrated by some numerical examples .",

    "they obtained some results on this sequence and its connections to the cumulative residual entropy .",

    "a simpler case was studied by baxter @xcite , who considered a stochastic process generated by the successive failures of a component which on failure is replaced by a component of equal age .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the reversed relevation transform , with a preliminary result based on the usual stochastic order , and an application to parallel systems involving the proportional reversed hazards rate model . some dual results for the relevation",
    "transform are then provided .",
    "we also address the problem of determining necessary and sufficient conditions such that the reversed relevation transform and the relevation transform are commutative .",
    "the new weighted distributions and their characteristics based on stochastic orders and ageing properties are discussed in section 3 , where the new notion of decreasing reversed hazard rate in length - biased sense is also considered . in section 4",
    ", various kinds of entropy such as shannon entropy , cumulative entropy and dynamic cumulative entropy are interviewed .",
    "then the connections between the earlier mentioned entropies and several functions of the given sequence are discussed .",
    "specifically we also obtain some iterative results for the involved quantities .",
    "these include a new probabilistic meaning for the cumulative entropy , which can be expressed as difference of means of consecutive random variables of the considered sequence .",
