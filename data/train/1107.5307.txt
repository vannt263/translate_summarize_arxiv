    "alternatively , several classes of agns are known to generate relativistic jets ( blazars , narrow - line seyfert 1 [ nls1 ] galaxies ) . if _ sw _  j2058 + 05  is shown to result from an agn ( e.g. , via repeated outbursts over the coming years ) , we would have uncovered yet another unique example of the already diverse phenomenology of variability from active galaxies .    throughout this work ,",

    "this field had been observed previously by the vla at 1.4ghz , once on 1996 july 8 as part of the nrao vla sky survey ( nvvs ; @xcite ) , and three times in 2009 ( march 9 , march 16 , and may 9 ) as part of the faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters ( first ;",

    "in figure  [ fig : lxlo ] , we plot the x - ray and optical luminosity of _ sw _  j2058 + 05  at an ( observer - frame ) time of @xmath65d after discovery . for comparison",
    ", we also plot analogous measurements for a sample of long - duration grb x - ray afterglows ( at the same epoch post - burst ) , as well as nearby agns , more distant , luminous quasars from sdss , and some of the most dramatically variable blazars _ observed while in outburst_. with an isotropic x - ray luminosity @xmath66ergs@xmath2 , _ sw _  j2058 + 05  is much too luminous at this late time to result from a grb . yet with an absolute magnitude of @xmath67mag , the observed optical emission is several orders of magnitude underluminous compared with the brightest x - ray quasars and blazars .",
    "even compared with simultaneous x - ray and optical observations of the strongest high - energy flares from some of the best - known blazars ( e.g. , markarian501 , @xcite ; 3c279 , @xcite ; markarian421 , @xcite ) , the ratio of x - ray to optical luminosity appears to be quite unique .",
    "however , _",
    "j2058 + 05  occupies a nearly identical region of this phase space as _ sw _  j1644 + 57 .",
    "this similarity is further reinforced when adding the radio observations to the broadband spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : sed ] we plot the sed of _ sw _  j2058 + 05  at @xmath68d after discovery , compared with analogous measurements for a sample of blazars , the most dramatically variable class of agns ( and also known sources of relativistic jets ; @xcite ; see  [ sec : physics ] ) .",
    "blazars exhibit a well - defined luminosity `` sequence '' whereby the lower - frequency maximum of their double - peaked sed occurs at lower energies for more luminous sources @xcite . while the radio and optical emission from _ sw _  j2058 + 05  are comparable to those seen in low - luminosity blazars , the x - ray emission outshines even the brightest sources of this class .",
    "on the other hand , the sed of _ sw _  j1644 + 57 , at a time of @xmath69d , provides a good match to the observed properties of _ sw _  j2058 + 05  ( particularly after correcting for the large but uncertain dust extinction from _ sw _  j1644 + 57 ) .",
    "while the sequence plotted in figure  [ fig : sed ] may represent the ensemble properties of blazars as a class , individual sources may exhibit quite different behavior . during an outburst , blazar seds can undergo radical changes  for example , as a result of a rapid brightening in 1997 , the low - energy ( synchrotron ) spectral peak in markarian501 shifted frequencies by approximately two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "we therefore also compare the observed sed of _ sw _  j2058 + 05  with that of several high - energy outbursts from known blazars in figure  [ fig : xrayopt ] .",
    "even when compared with these extreme cases , the ratio of the x - ray to optical flux observed in _",
    "j2058 + 05  stands out , being similar only to the broadband properties of _ sw _  j1644 + 57 .",
    "the sole remaining defining characteristic of _ sw _  j1644 + 57  is its association with the nucleus of a nonactive galaxy @xcite . at the current time , the observed optical emission from _ sw _  j2058 + 05  appears to be dominated by the transient , and we have no constraints on the location of the host nucleus from pre - outburst observations .",
    "future high - resolution observations , when the transient light has faded , should be able to constrain the transient - nucleus offset .",
    "that said , the detection of strong absorption features indicates that the line of sight penetrates a dense region of the host galaxy ( as in the case of some grbs ) .",
    "finally , we utilize the optical spectrum to search for evidence of past agn activity . like blazars ,",
    "nls1 galaxies are another subclass of agns that can sometimes power relativistic jets ( e.g. , @xcite ;  [ sec : physics ] ) .",
    "similarly , some nls1 galaxies have been associated with luminous ( @xmath70ergs@xmath2 ) x - ray outbursts ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the case of _ sw",
    "_  j1644 + 57 , all of the detected emission lines were unresolved , and standard diagnostic diagrams revealed no evidence for ionization from a hidden ( i.e. , compton thick ) agn @xcite .",
    "the larger redshift precludes such an analysis for _ sw _  j2058 + 05 , as the standard diagnostic lines do not fall in the optical bandpass .",
    "however , we have compiled all of the available spectra from sdss of known nls1 galaxies ( from the catalog of @xcite ) with @xmath71 ( 478 objects ) , and used these to create an nls1 template . this composite spectrum is plotted alongside that of _ sw _",
    "j2058 + 05  in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "the template exhibits strong , broad emission from ] @xmath482324 , [ ] @xmath722422 , 2424 , and in particular @xmath722796 , 2803 .",
    "none of these emission lines are detected in our spectrum of _ sw _",
    "j2058 + 05 .",
    "in fact , of the 478 known nls1 galaxies in sdss with @xmath71 , all but one have well - detected ( @xmath73 ) in emission .",
    "unless exceedingly rare , the optical spectrum of _ sw _  j2058 + 05  suggests that it is not an nls1 galaxy .",
    "we have furthermore performed a similar analysis with all known bl lac sources from @xcite at @xmath71 in the sdss archive ( 68 sources ) ; the resulting median spectrum is shown in red in figure  [ fig : spec ] . by definition ,",
    "bl lacs lack the bright emission features present in the spectra of nls1 galaxies , and therefore they more closely resemble the observed spectrum of _ sw _  j2058 + 05 .",
    "however , bl lac spectra do typically exhibit @xmath743934 , 3968 in absorption , which is lacking in _ sw _  j2058 + 05 , and not a single bl lac in the sdss database exhibits strong absorption .",
    "while we can not entirely rule out a new mode of variability in a blazar , the unique sed and optical spectrum distinguish _ sw _",
    "j2058 + 05from known members of this class as well .",
    "we have shown in the previous section that _ sw _  j2058 + 05  does not appear consistent with any known class of agns ( particularly blazars and nls1 ) .",
    "based on the many similarities with _",
    "_  j1644 + 57 , we can use the same arguments to derive the basic physical parameters for _ sw _  j2058 + 05  ( e.g. , @xcite ) . from our nir observations ,",
    "we derive an upper limit on the host - galaxy absolute @xmath75-band magnitude of @xmath76mag ( we have used an s0 galaxy template from @xcite for the k - correction based on the lack of emission features in the optical spectrum ) . applying the black hole mass vs. bulge luminosity @xcite correlation from @xcite and assuming a bulge - dominated system , we limit the mass of the putative central black hole to be @xmath77 m@xmath6 .",
    "separately , the shortest observed x - ray variability time scale can be used to constrain the central black hole mass using causality arguments ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for an observer - frame variability time scale of @xmath78s , we find @xmath79 m@xmath6 .",
    "the most dramatic short time scale variability observed from _",
    "sw _  j1644 + 57  occurred at @xmath80d @xcite , before we commenced x - ray observations of _ sw _",
    "j2058 + 05 .",
    "but even at late times , the x - ray light curve of _ sw _  j2058 + 05  exhibits a degree of variability ( changes of an order of magnitude on time scales of a few days ) not seen in _",
    "j2058 + 05 , suggesting an imperfect analogy between these two sources .",
    "finally , we can constrain the central mass using the black hole fundamental plane , a relationship between mass , x - ray luminosity , and radio luminosity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "application of this relation requires knowledge of the beaming fraction , for which we adopt a value of @xmath81 ( see below ) .",
    "following @xcite , we find @xmath82 m@xmath6 ; however , we caution that the scatter in this relationship is even larger than that found in the black hole mass vs. bulge luminosity relation .    the derived black hole mass , @xmath83 m@xmath6 , is of vital importance for two main reasons .",
    "first , the tidal disruption of a solar - type star will only occur outside the event horizon for @xmath84 m@xmath6 .",
    "as such , if the origin of the accreting material is indeed the tidal disruption of a nondegenerate star ( or more massive object ) , the mass of the central black hole in the host galaxy of _ sw _  j2058 + 05  must be sufficiently small m@xmath6 ; @xcite ) , and may even allow for the disruption of a white dwarf @xcite . ] .",
    "future observations of the host , when the optical transient light has faded , should provide a significantly improved estimate of @xmath85 .",
    "second , for @xmath86 m@xmath6 , the observed x - ray emission exceeds the eddington luminosity .",
    "in particular , the peak isotropic 0.310kev x - ray luminosity of @xmath87ergs@xmath2 exceeds the eddington value by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "given the long - lived nature of the central engine , this suggests the outflow is likely to be collimated with a beaming factor @xmath88 ( cf . , @xcite )",
    ". an even larger degree of collimation is required to reconcile the observed rate of these outbursts with theoretical predictions for tdfs (  [ sec : implications ] ) .",
    "more robust evidence for beaming is provided by the large radio luminosity .",
    "it is well known that the brightness temperature of an incoherent radio source can not exceed @xmath89k for extended periods of time @xcite . utilizing this fact , we can derive a lower limit on the angular size of the radio - emitting region , @xmath90@xmath91as .",
    "assuming that the outflow commencement coincides with the hard x - ray discovery , this implies a mean expansion velocity of @xmath92 , or a mildly relativistic expansion with @xmath93 .",
    "furthermore , the radio emission will be collimated into a viewing angle @xmath94 due to relativistic beaming effects .    if we integrate over the x - ray light curve to date ( 2011 july 20 ) , we find that _ sw _  j2058 + 05  has emitted a total 0.310kev fluence of @xmath95erg@xmath17 .",
    "if we assume this accounts for @xmath96 of the broadband luminosity , the total isotropic energy release is @xmath97erg , comparable to that of _ sw _  j1644 + 57  at a similar epoch .",
    "for a typical radiative efficiency for accretion power ( @xmath98 ) , the tidal disruption of a solar - type star would require a significant beaming correction .",
    "if only a small fraction of the available energy is allocated to the observed relativistic component ( @xmath99% ) , this would imply @xmath100 .",
    "in addition to the weaker degree of x - ray variability , we wish to draw attention to two other important differences between these sources .",
    "unlike that case of _ sw _  j1644 + 57 , the observed uv / optical sed of _ sw _",
    "j2058 + 05  is quite blue .",
    "in fact , the rest - frame uv data for _ sw _  j2058 + 05  can be well fit by a blackbody spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xrayopt ] ) , with @xmath101k , @xmath102ergs@xmath2 , and @xmath103au .",
    "the derived blackbody parameters are similar to the thermal emission observed from previous tdf candidates discovered at uv and optical wavelengths @xcite , and are strongly suggestive of an accretion disk origin for the optical light . in this sense , _ sw _  j2058 + 05  may serve as a link between the bright , nonthermal x - rays observed in the relativistic tdf candidates , and the thermal disk emission from `` classical '' tdfs . such comparisons were not possible for _ sw _  j1644 + 57  due to dust in the host galaxy .    more importantly , the radio spectral index of _ sw _  j2058 + 05  appears to be quite flat ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "this stands in stark contrast to _ sw _  j1644 + 57 , which was optically thick ( @xmath105 ) up to high frequencies in the days and weeks following discovery @xcite .",
    "this may simply reflect physical differences in the jet ( e.g. , microphysics ) or its environment ( e.g. , density ) , as is suggested by the different extinction properties .",
    "however , it may also imply a more extended ( and hence long - lived ) radio source , which would be difficult to reconcile with a tidal disruption origin .",
    "future high - resolution radio interferometry ( i.e. , vlbi ) may be able to resolve this issue .",
    "the detection of a second member of this new class of relativistic tdfs would have important implications for the rate of these events . given the larger redshift of _ sw",
    "_  j2058 + 05 , a significantly larger comoving volume ( factor of 20 ) is accessible to detect analogous sources .",
    "if we adopt the local density of supermassive black holes from @xcite ( @xmath106@xmath107mpc@xmath108 ) and a tdf rate per galaxy of @xmath109yr@xmath2 ( @xmath11010 ; @xcite ) , the all - sky rate of tdfs within this volume is @xmath111yr@xmath2 .",
    "given the long - lived nature of the hard x - ray emission , it seems likely that the _ swift_-bat would be capable of detecting similar outbursts within this volume over the entire sky during the course of its 7 years of operations to date .",
    "thus , if all tdfs emitted similarly bright high - energy radiation isotropically , _",
    "would have detected @xmath112 such outbursts to date .",
    "given the unique x - ray light curve , it is unlikely we have confused a large number of these events with long - duration grbs ( or , for that matter , other high - energy transients ) .",
    "so that the observed rate is reduced by a factor of @xmath113 , commensurate with having only seen two such events , we are therefore left to conclude either ( 1 ) the typical beaming fraction of these sources is extremely small ( @xmath4 ) , or ( 2 ) only some fraction of tdfs are capable of generating these relativistic outflows .",
    "drawing an analogy with grbs and core - collapse supernovae , it may be that rapid rotation of the central black hole is required to generate _",
    "_  j2058 + 05-like events .",
    "if so , tdfs could provide a truly unique diagnostic to constrain the spin of the central black holes in distant galaxies .",
    "late - time radio observations should be able to distinguish between these two possibilities @xcite . much as has been done with long - duration grbs @xcite , accurate calorimetry can be performed in the nonrelativistic regime when the outflow is spherical , bypassing any concerns about geometric corrections .",
    "separately , the detection of off - axis events could also help address this fundamental issue @xcite , and such searches will be greatly facilitated by future wide - field radio telescopes ( e.g. , lofar , ska ) .    if , on the other hand , it is demonstrated that the emission from _ sw _  j2058 + 05  was powered by an agn ( e.g. , if repeated outbursts are detected in upcoming months and years ) , this would add yet another example to the already complex taxonomy of active galaxies .",
    "the rapid onset of accretion ( when compared to the typical system lifetime , @xmath114yr ) would likely require some revision of our understanding of how material is channeled into the supermassive black hole , and/or the physical processes responsible for launching blazar jets .",
    "it would also greatly complicate the search for future tdfs , as standard spectroscopic diagnostic diagrams would appear to be insufficient to distinguish agns from normal inactive galaxies .",
