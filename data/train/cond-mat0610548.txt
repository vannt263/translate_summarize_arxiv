    "the @xmath0-axis conductivity in layered superconductors is at the same time a fascinating puzzle and a source of interesting information on the nature of high-@xmath6 cuprates .",
    "focussing on bi@xmath7sr@xmath7cacu@xmath7o@xmath2 ( bi:2212 ) , on passing from underdoping to overdoping , the @xmath0-axis resistivity @xmath8 changes from monotonically decreasing from @xmath6 to high temperature to a non - monotonic behaviour , displaying a minimum at a temperature usually higher than the pseudogap temperature @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this latter feature has led to a description in terms of tunnelling phenomena along the @xmath0-axis accompanied by some kind of charge localization on the @xmath9 planes @xcite .",
    "such localization becomes even stronger in the so - called pseudogap phase @xcite , as testified by an increase of @xmath8 and a change of slope in the in - plane resistivity ( @xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "+ in addition to the study of the @xmath0-axis resistivity , many investigations have been devoted to the study of the nonlinear electrical response exhibited by the @xmath11 characteristic @xcite , @xmath5 curves @xcite , @xmath12 at high applied voltages @xcite or a combination of such measurements @xcite .",
    "while in general terms it is fair to say that by means of such measurements one can get information both on the normal state underlying the pseudogap state and on the pseudogap state itself as well as on the superconducting state quasiparticle response , the discussion on such data is still very active @xcite .",
    "+ confining for the moment our attention to some feature of the measurements taken in artificially patterned mesa structures , the so called `` intrinsic tunnelling spectroscopy '' , we recall some of the results that are particularly pertinent to the present work . in overdoped and",
    "optimally doped bscco mesas @xcite , composed by several unit cells , the differential conductivity exhibits two distinct behaviours for voltages higher than a characteristic value , @xmath13 , and for small ( vanishing ) voltages , @xmath14 .",
    "the ( @xmath14 ) behaviour usually regarded as originating from quasiparticles , but the strangest features came from the large voltage behaviour indicated as `` normal '' resistance @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , it was found that @xmath15 was linear in @xmath16 down to @xmath17 , in contrast with the usual behaviour of @xmath8 .",
    "this feature does not seem to have been satisfactorily described .",
    "+ in two recent papers @xcite we have addressed the issue of the out - of - plane , normal state @xmath8 resistivities within a phenomenological model for bilayer superconductors , based on the existence of two energy barriers with different height and width , over which the electrical transport was determined by two complementary processes , namely incoherent tunnelling @xcite and thermal activation across the two barriers . in spite of the simplicity of the model , we have been able to fit a very wide set of @xmath8 data taken in bscco following the change of the temperature dependence of the @xmath0-axis resistivity with increasing doping @xmath18 .",
    "more precisely we showed that : + _ ( i ) _ for @xmath19 the model ( which explicitly refers to the genuine normal state , with an electron density of states that is uniform in energy ) was able to describe the @xmath8 data with a reduced number of fitting parameters , with a direct physical interpretation .",
    "the accuracy of the fit was as good in the underdoped region as in the overdoped one .",
    "( ii ) _ for @xmath20 , using the normal @xmath0-axis resistivity as determined by our model , we described the loss of conductivity in the pseudogap state by a reduction of the effective number of charge carriers .",
    "we obtained the fraction @xmath21 of the `` gapped '' carriers that do not participate to the conduction along the c - axis , defined through @xmath22 \\rightarrow \\rho_c(t)=\\frac{\\rho_{c , n}(t)}{1-\\eta(t ) } \\label{eta_def}\\ ] ] and we found that the curves @xmath21 at different dopings could be scaled onto a universal curve @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we extend the analysis of the data by means of the proposed model , by extending it to nonzero voltages , thus allowing a comparison of the model with the data taken on the mesa structures .",
    "the main result of this paper will be a comprehensive and satisfactory explanation of the mesa resistivity branches , both for @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) and for @xmath13 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the basic idea of the two - barrier model .",
    "we extend the model to finite applied voltage , and we discuss the limiting forms . in sec.[fits ] we compare the model to a variety of measurements taken at various @xmath16 on bscco crystals .",
    "conclusions are reported in sec.[conc ]",
    "-axis resistivity .",
    "the different processes ( thermal activation and tunnelling ) and heights @xmath25 and widths @xmath26 of the barriers are depicted .",
    "the barriers can be thought of as arising from the ca layer and the sr - bi - bi - sr block , respectively . ]",
    "as already mentioned , in two recent papers @xcite we have presented a phenomenological model for the out - of - plane resistivity @xmath12 in bilayer superconductors . in this model",
    "the temperature dependence of the @xmath0-axis resistivity in the genuine normal state ( @xmath27 , where @xmath3 indicates the pseudogap opening ) arises from the existence of two different energy barriers along the @xmath0-axis , taken of rectangular shape with different heights ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 , as measured from the fermi level ) and widths @xmath30 and @xmath31 , as depicted in fig.[rectbarrier ] . in this spatial energy landscape , in the normal state two mechanisms ( for each barrier ) contribute to the interlayer transport : _ (",
    "i ) _ thermal activation of the carriers above the barrier _ ( ii ) _ tunnelling of the charge carriers partially inhibited by incoherent in - plane scattering .",
    "+ the tunnelling contribution over each of the barriers was identified as given by the model of ref.@xcite , for which the tunnelling contribution to the @xmath0-axis resistivity is modified by the existence of the interplanar incoherent scattering , leading to a confinement of the charge carriers in the @xmath32 planes . in this model , the in - plane phononic , inelastic scattering , with characteristic time @xmath33 , reduces the tunnelling matrix element @xmath34 to @xmath35 when @xmath33 is much smaller than the time between two tunnelling elements .",
    "these features of the model imply a relation between the in - plane and the out - of - plane resistivities .",
    "the overall expression for the normal state effective resistivity along the c - axis , @xmath36 , is obtained as a function of the in - plane @xmath37 from the series of the two barriers @xcite : @xmath38^{-1 } \\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\sum_{i=1,2}\\frac{d_{i}}{d_{1}+d_{2}}\\left [   \\frac{1}{\\rho_{tun , i}}+ \\frac{1}{\\rho_{th , i}}\\right]^{-1 } \\label{rholin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last equality defines the tunnelling ( @xmath39 ) and thermal ( @xmath40 ) resistivities of the @xmath41th barrier , respectively , the term @xmath42 takes into account the increased localization due to the in - plane phononic scattering and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is the spacing between the layers ( we have taken @xmath45  , @xmath46  , the bilayer and the sr - bi - bi - sr block thickness , respectively ) . in this expression @xmath47 $ ] ( with @xmath48 @xcite ) and @xmath49 is the height of the @xmath50-th barrier .",
    "since the in - plane resistivity @xmath37 is independently measured , eq.[rholin ] contains five adjustable parameters : @xmath51 , with the additional constraint that @xmath52 is doping - independent .",
    "@xmath53 is determined by @xmath54 , with its prefactor absorbed in @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "note that @xmath57 can be combined in such a way that only two of them determine the shape of the fitting curve , while the third affects the fit only through a scale factor .",
    "+    [ htb ]    -axis resistance as calculated in the two - barrier model ( black thick line ) , @xmath58 , where s is the transverse section .",
    "here we have neglected ( see text ) the thermal conductivity across the higher barrier .",
    "the contributions of the first barrier ( red thick line ) and the thermal ( dashed line ) and tunnel ( thin continuous line ) contributions of the second barrier are separately plotted ( @xmath59 for the tunnelling resistance of each barrier , and similarly for the thermal contribution ) .",
    "we also report the effect of increasing @xmath29 ( dotted lines ) . ]    in order to avoid unnecessary complications , we recall that the thermal contribution to the higher barrier ( 1 ) was found to be negligible @xcite , with @xmath60 , so that for this barrier we can safely assume @xmath61 in the whole temperature range explored ( @xmath62300k ) .",
    "the reference expression for the effective resistivity then simplifies to : @xmath63 in figure [ rhomaster ] we present a sketch of the resulting temperature dependence of the @xmath0-axis normal state resistivity @xmath36 . a thorough discussion of the parameters involved in equation [ rholin ] , and of their dependence on doping @xmath18 has been given in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "however , it is interesting to plot separately the various contributions to the overall resistivity , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "+ in particular , equation [ overall_rho_c ] predicts for @xmath36 the following general behaviour : at very low @xmath16 , @xmath64 , so that @xmath36 is substantially the sum of the two tunnelling resistivities @xmath65 and @xmath66 , both of them linearly increasing as a function of @xmath16 . as a result",
    ", @xmath36 increases linearly with @xmath16 at low temperatures . at intermediate @xmath16 , @xmath67 so that in this temperature region the resistivity of the barrier 2 is dominated by the thermal activation term and is thus decreasing with @xmath16 , and so is also the overall @xmath36 .",
    "finally , at high @xmath16 @xmath68 , so that @xmath69 , again increasing linearly with @xmath16 .",
    "the crossover from thermally activated ( @xmath70 ) to tunnel dominated behaviour ( @xmath71 ) occurs for @xmath721 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this crossover reproduces in a natural way the minimum experimentally found in measurements of @xmath12 in optimal and overdoped samples , assigning it to a smaller @xmath29 with respect to underdoped samples . in this framework ,",
    "the minimum is not a manifestation of the opening of the pseudogap , which occurs at a lower temperature .",
    "we stress that , as mentioned in @xcite , the fits of @xmath12 ( at low voltages ) only allow us to set a lower bound for @xmath52 . +",
    "a second interesting feature of the model is that it naturally leads to @xmath0-axis resistance linear in @xmath16 at low temperature , as observed in mesa structures at high voltage bias ( that is for applied voltages @xmath13 , where @xmath73 is a typical voltage applied to the mesa structure above which the @xmath11 curve becomes approximately linear ) .",
    "these data are reported , e.g. , in fig.2 of ref.@xcite and in fig.1 ( inset ) of ref.@xcite . + within our model , as the voltage is increased the effective height of the second barrier decreases ( see also below ) while the much higher first barrier remains substantially unaffected . as a result ,",
    "both the thermal and tunnelling resistivities of the second barrier become much smaller than their zero voltage values , so that the high voltage resistivity approaches the tunnelling value @xmath65 : @xmath74 ( @xmath75 is the cross - section of the mesa structure ) which , due to the linear dependence ( as a function of @xmath16 ) of the in - plane resistivity directly explains the ( so far unexplained ) linear behaviour of @xmath76 , as observed in mesa structure data @xcite .",
    "+ in the following , we analytically extend our model to nonvanishing voltages @xmath77 , in order to compare the predictions with the large amount of data taken on mesa structures . + to be quantitatively applied to measurements of the nonlinear resistance , @xmath11 and @xmath5 characteristics , the model requires a generalization that includes a direct effect of the applied voltage on the barrier height . in this case",
    "the rectangular barrier framework is no longer appropriate and a more accurate modelling of the barrier must be performed in order to take into account the decreasing of the barrier height with the external electric field . as depicted in fig.[parabolic ] , we have chosen parabolic barriers since this choice allows for analytical results . the energy profile along the @xmath0-axis ( @xmath78 direction )",
    "is then given by two parabolic barriers with the shape : @xmath79 in the interval @xmath80 , and zero otherwise .",
    "the parameter @xmath81 is directly related to the previously defined height of the barrier @xmath49 through the relation @xmath82 ( see also figure [ parabolic ] ) , while @xmath83 .",
    "we stress that the choice of parabolic barriers , given the same widths @xmath26 as in the rectangular barriers , does not introduce additional parameters .",
    "+        now we describe the different transport processes in the finite voltage regime .",
    "we consider first the activation process . in the presence of an external electric field",
    "@xmath84 , the barrier becomes @xmath85 .",
    "assuming that the volume density of carrier @xmath86 outside the barrier , the thermal charge current density is @xcite : @xmath87/k_{b}t}dx } \\label{jth}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath89 is the voltage drop across the @xmath50-th barrier .",

    "the integral on rhs can be expressed in terms of the error function @xmath91 , and after some straightforward calculation one gets the contribution of the activation to the diffusion transport current for a single barrier : @xmath92      2 \\phi\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{(4u_{ci}-ev_{i})^{2}-16e_{f}u_{ci}}{16u_{ci}k_{b}t}}\\right ) } \\label{jthfin}\\ ] ] in considering the tunnel resistivity , we make use of the expression @xmath93 de \\label{jtun}\\ ] ] as for the field emission effect with the additional localization considered in reference @xcite , which we assume to be valid also in the nonlinear regime . here @xmath94 is the ( energy dependent ) transparency of the barrier and @xmath95 is the fermi function . to calculate @xmath94",
    ", we use the same barrier s profile @xmath96 used to calculate the thermal contribution . for a generic energy level @xmath97 in an external field the barrier s profile is shown in fig.[parabolic ] . after some calculation",

    "@xmath101 is the electric field on the @xmath50-th barrier .",
    "the total current in the series of the two barriers is the sum of the various contributions each with its specific values of the parameters .",
    "+ it must be noted that , in the nonlinear regime , several complications arise .",
    "first of all , the energy dependences of the current densities ( thermal and tunnelling ) is very complex by itself , and additionally due to the very similarity of the energy scales involved : the energy @xmath97 , the fermi level @xmath102 and , in some ranges , the thermal energy @xmath103 are all of the same order of magnutude .",
    "a second , more subtle complication is due to the nature of the double barrier : the experimentally controlled parameter is the external potential @xmath77 , applied at the series of two barriers ( assuming , as in measurements of the mesa structures , that one knows the number of junctions @xmath104 involved , the applied voltage is just @xmath105 ) .",
    "however , @xmath77 is _ not _ the voltage across each barrier , but the sum of the potential drops over the two barriers : @xmath106 . due to the temperature and to nonlinear effects ,",
    "the ratio @xmath107 is not constant .",
    "one can implicitly obtain each @xmath89 by requiring that the total current through the two barriers be the same : @xmath108 , with @xmath109 ( the cross section @xmath75 is the same throughout the sample ) .",
    "one can thus solve numerically to obtain @xmath110 and @xmath111 as a function of @xmath77 and the @xmath112 and @xmath113 for every temperature and arbitrary @xmath77 .",
    "+ we are now in the position to perform some comparison between the model here developed and the data for the @xmath0-axis transport .",
    "the next section is dedicated to this task .",
    "in this section we report the application of the model developed in sec.[model ] , based on parabolic barriers , to experimental data for @xmath0-axis transport in bscco reported in the literature or measured in our laboratory .",
    "we first analyze the data for the @xmath0-axis resistance taken in optimally doped bscco single crystal mesa structures @xcite . since those data were taken at small ( @xmath14 ) and large ( @xmath114 ) voltages , the simultaneous fitting of both sets of data allows a precise determination of the doping - independent value of @xmath52 .",
    "once determined , this value will be kept fixed in the fits of all the other data at various dopings .",

    "due to the illustrative nature of these fittings , we describe in some detail the procedure that we followed in order to reduce the number of fitting parameters . for the small voltage resistivity , we have to refer to eq.[rholin ] , which contains the in - plane resistivity @xmath10 . since those data were not available in @xcite , we compared the out - of - plane resistance with our data taken in bscco single crystals at various doping @xmath18 by an eight terminal contact method , which allows us to extract simultaneously @xmath12 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "as reported in fig.[figv0vg ] , our data for a crystal with nominal doping @xmath1170.255 coincides with the @xmath116 data in @xcite within an overall scale factor .",
    "we then decided to use our data for @xmath10 in the fitting . by adjusting @xmath29 , @xmath122 , @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    "it is possible to fit well the normal state @xmath116 down to a temperature @xmath3 where the pseudogap opens ( we come back to this point below , see also @xcite ) . for the data of @xmath115 one",
    "has to refer to the complex procedure decribed in sec.[model ] , calculating the total @xmath123 with the dynamic voltage partition between the two barriers . in this case",

    "we have taken @xmath1252000 k , as indicated by the simultaneous fittings above performed .",
    "thus , once a simultaneous fit of low and high voltage resistance has been performed at a single doping , the fits at all the other dopings contain only four adjustable parameters ( one of which acts as a scale factor only , see sec.[model ] ) . as can be seen",
