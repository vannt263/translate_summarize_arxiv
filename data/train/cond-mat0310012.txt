    "more than a hundred years ago drude put forth a theory of metallic conduction @xcite . in his theory electrons",
    "are treated as a gas of particles which are assumed to move along classical trajectories until they collide with one another or with the ions .",
    "the collisions abruptly alter the velocity of the electrons , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figintro1 ] . since that time several details of drude",
    "s theory have been improved . in drude",
    "s time , for example , it seemed reasonable to assume that the electronic velocity distribution at equilibrium was given by the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "about a quarter of a century later , sommerfeld replaced the maxwell - boltzmann distribution by the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "a further important step was the description of collisions beyond the relaxation time approximation , which finally led to the boltzmann equation for the dynamics of the distribution function .",
    "in many cases the transport theory based on the boltzmann equation successfully describes the electrical conductivity of metals . on the other hand",
    "the boltzmann theory still assumes that electrons move along classical trajectories , and quantum mechanical interference effects are neglected .",
    "the latter become important at a high concentration of defects or in very small systems .",
    "therefore , in the limits of strong disorder or small system size , the boltzmann equation fails and the transport becomes non - classical .    alternatively , following landauer  @xcite , one can adopt a quantum mechanical description of charge transport : consider , for example , a constriction as shown in fig .",
    "[ figintro2 ] .",
    "an incoming electron wave is transmitted or reflected at the constriction with amplitudes @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the current is then proportional to the transmission probability , _",
    "i.e. _  the squared modulus of the amplitude . for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to zero temperature and a one - dimensional conducting channel for now . by assuming two different chemical potentials in the left and right reservoir , @xmath3 , the current through the constriction is given by @xmath4 the factor",
    "two is due to the electron spin .",
    "the product of the density of states @xmath5 times the velocity @xmath6 does not depend on energy and is equal to @xmath7 . as a result",
    "the conductance of the constriction is determined as @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "+        the connection between the scattering amplitudes and the conductance was first proposed by landauer  @xcite . generalizations of the conductance formula ( [ eqintro2 ] ) , including for example many transport channels and more than two leads , have been discussed intensively in the literature @xcite .",
    "the landauer approach to the conductance has been successfully applied to describe transport through structures where the quantum mechanical coherence of the electron wave functions is maintained over the full system .",
    "a fascinating example is the transport through quantum point contacts , which has been studied using both , semiconductor devices @xcite as well as single atoms  @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we will focus on the transport in metallic systems , where the classical approach to the conductivity is still a good starting point , but quantum effects give rise to various types of corrections to the drude conductivity .",
    "the two corrections that will be considered in this review are weak localization , which is a pure one - particle phenomenon , and effects arising from the combination of disorder and electron - electron interactions .    in order to give a simple idea of how these quantum corrections arise and to highlight the connection between the semiclassical and landauer s approach",
    ", we present here a physical picture of the origin of weak localization . for reviews on this subject see @xcite . the weak localization correction to",
    "the conductivity arises as a result of the quantum interference of electron waves in disordered systems .",
    "is the phase coherence time , and @xmath10 is the diffusion constant.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to travel from point @xmath11 to point @xmath12 electrons move along classical paths . in order to obtain the total probability for a transfer from point @xmath11 to @xmath12 , in classical physics",
    ", one has to sum the probabilities for a particle to move along all possible paths . in quantum mechanics",
    "one has to sum the amplitudes of each path and take the modulus squared at the end .",
    "the relevant paths for weak localization are those with self - intersections and with the velocities of the incoming and outgoing paths in opposite directions as shown in fig .",
    "[ figintro3 ] .",
    "an electron can travel around the path clockwise or anti - clockwise .",
    "the two paths can be assigned an amplitude @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; the probability is then proportional to @xmath15 the first two terms on the right hand side correspond to the classical probabilities .",
    "the third term , giving the interference between @xmath13 and @xmath14 , only appears in quantum mechanics .",
    "for the special type of paths considered , the interference term is always positive , _",
    "i.e. _  due to interference the probability of the process is enhanced . neglecting the interference corresponds to a classical description of the electrons ( drude - sommerfeld theory , boltzmann equation ) .",
    "this article summarizes recent contributions to the theoretical description of transport in mesoscopic conductors .",
    "the central questions addressed are the following :    * in which way is transport modified by electron - electron interactions ? * what happens in the presence of a large voltage , when linear response theory fails ?",
    "both questions are relevant for the interpretation of experiments : shortly after the discovery of weak localization , it was found that similar effects in the conductivity are caused by the electron - electron interaction @xcite .",
    "furthermore electron - electron interactions are also relevant for weak localization itself , since they provide a mechanism for phase breaking . however , while it is clear that inelastic scattering contributes to dephasing , the exact way this happens is far less obvious , as is evident from the recent debates in the literature @xcite .",
    "the importance of studying non - linear transport is also apparent : several transport experiments on mesoscopic samples are carried out at low temperatures . under these conditions inelastic scattering events which drive the electron system towards local equilibrium freeze out .",
    "therefore non - equilibrium conditions can be realized even at rather low voltages .    here",
    "we will use the quasiclassical formalism which , as its historical predecessor , _",
    "i.e_.  the boltzmann equation , is very powerful in dealing with situations far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "this was , for example , exploited in studying the dynamics of superconductors in the 1960s and 1970s @xcite and hybrid mesoscopic systems in the 1990s @xcite . in particular , we will show , that the quasiclassical method provides a convenient framework to describe both quantum interference ( weak localization ) and coulomb interaction effects in normal - conducting systems out of equilibrium .",
    "the article is arranged as follows : in section [ chclassical ] we introduce the green s function technique in the non - equilibrium ( keldysh ) formulation , which is the main theoretical tool used throughout this article . in particular , after giving the definition of the quasiclassical green s function , we derive the equation of motion as well as the boundary conditions to be used in the presence of interfaces . following the literature we will demonstrate how a boltzmann - like theory and the drude conductivity are recovered within this formalism . in section [ chcoul ] transport beyond the drude - boltzmann theory will be considered . by extending the formalism of section [ chclassical ] contributions to the current density due to",
    "`` maximally crossed diagrams '' and due to the coulomb interaction will be calculated .",
    "sections [ chcoulapp ] and [ secnanno ] will be devoted to applications , _",
    "i.e. _ , the general expression for the current density of section [ chcoul ] will be evaluated explicitly for different experimental setups . to begin with , in section [ chcoulapp ]",
    ", we will consider the limit of weak electric field and derive the well - known expression for the coulomb correction to the drude conductivity .",
    "this will be followed by a discussion of the the non - linear conductivity in films .",
    "furthermore we will investigate the question of whether the phase coherence time @xmath16 , which is a central quantity for weak localization , is relevant for the coulomb interaction corrections to the conductivity as well . in section [ secnanno ] we will analyze non - linear transport in wires and in the presence of interfaces . in order to illustrate the power of the method",
    "we first show how to obtain the coulomb blockade theory .",
    "we will also discuss the different regimes that arise depending on how the length of the wire compares with the thermal diffusion , inelastic electron - electron and electron - phonon lengths .",
    "chapter [ secsummary ] summarizes the main results .",
    "a few technical details are provided in the appendices . in appendix [ secappa ]",
    "we outline the correspondence of the quasiclassical formalism with the field - theoretic approach based on the non - linear sigma model . in appendix",

    "while castellani _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite came to the conclusion that the answer is `` yes '' to both questions , raimondi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite who reexamined the problem , confirmed the suggestion that dephasing is relevant also in the interaction contribution to the conductivity , but found a different dephasing time for the latter compared to weak localization .",
    "after some historical remarks we will give a semi - quantitative summary of the analysis carried out in @xcite .    while it is clear that inelastic scattering contributes to dephasing , the precise way this happens is less obvious .",
    "it was first noted by schmid @xcite that the inelastic quasi - particle scattering time is enhanced in the presence of disorder . the dephasing time was initially assumed to be identical to the inelastic quasi - particle scattering time @xcite , thus the inverse dephasing time was assumed to be @xmath310 in two dimensions . some time later , fukuyama and abrahams @xcite reexamined the problem in terms of standard diagrams and calculated the `` mass '' that develops in the particle - particle propagator ( the cooperon ) in the presence of coulomb interaction .",
    "they also found an inverse time proportional to @xmath311 .",
    "furthermore a mass term also appears in the particle - hole propagator ( the diffuson ) @xcite .",
    "the mass in the particle - hole propagator turned out to coincide with that in the particle - particle propagator .",
    "however , calculating a mass is not sufficient in order to draw final conclusions ; altshuler , aronov , and khmelnitskii @xcite , for example , calculated the dephasing time via a path - integral approach and predicted an inverse dephasing time proportional to @xmath42 , in contrast to @xcite .",
    "this result  see also @xcite  has been confirmed in many experiments .",
    "the approach of altshuler , aronov , and khmelnitskii has been extended later in order to determine the relevant dephasings times for the universal conductance fluctuations @xcite , and in the particle - hole channel @xcite .",
    "the general idea is that the phase of an electron which is propagating along a path @xmath312 is shifted by @xmath313 . in the presence of fluctuating internal fields",
    "this results in phase fluctuations which finally destroys phase coherence . in thermal equilibrium",
    "the internal electric field fluctuations are given by @xmath314 where @xmath315 , @xmath316 are the keldysh and the retarded coulomb interaction , and low frequencies ( @xmath317 ) have been assumed . the assumption of low frequencies is essential here since only in this frequency regime the classical field fluctuations , _",
    "i.e_.  the keldysh component of the interaction , dominates whereas at higher frequencies the nontrivial structure of the interaction in keldysh space has to be taken into account .",
    "it has been shown by fukuyama and abrahams @xcite and castellani _ et al . _",
    "@xcite that the high frequency contributions of the coulomb interaction renormalize parameters like the diffusion constant but do not contribute to dephasing .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to neglect these high frequency contributions in the following .",
    "the particle - particle propagator ( cooperon ) and the particle - hole propagator ( diffuson ) in the presence of the fluctuating field can then be written as a path - integral : @xmath318 d^\\eta_{t , t'}({\\bf x } , { \\bf x } ' ) & = & \\int_{{\\bf x}'_{t ' } = { \\bf x } ' } ^{{\\bf x}_t= { \\bf x } } { \\cal d } { \\bf x}_{t_1 } \\exp- ( s_0^{\\rm p.h.}+ s_1^{\\rm p.h . } ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath319   \\\\ & & s_0^{\\rm p.h . }",

    "since we have to consider the phase difference of pairs of classical paths , the vector potential appears twice in @xmath320 . in the case of the cooperon",
    "the two paths are the time reversed of the other , _ i.e_. , to a velocity @xmath322 on path `` @xmath323 '' corresponds a velocity @xmath324 on path `` @xmath325 '' and in the expression for the phase difference the sum of two vector potentials appears . in the case of the diffuson",
    "the two paths are traversed in the same direction , but at different times .",

    "the low frequency electric field fluctuations considered here , can not explain the strong phase breaking observed in @xcite .",
    "however we expect similar results for other phase breaking mechanisms : we suggest that a mechanism leading to strong dephasing in the particle - particle channel will also cause strong dephasing in the particle - hole channel .",
    "in particular when @xmath16 becomes comparable to or shorter than the thermal time @xmath309 , the relevant time scale which sets the amplitude of the coulomb interaction contribution to the conductivity will be @xmath16 instead of @xmath309 .",

    "experimentally the magnetic field scale varies as @xmath349 , which is close to the temperature variation of the dephasing rate .",
    "this suggests that the origin of the spin component of the magneto - resistance might indeed be the coulomb interaction contribution to the conductance , but in the presence of an up to now unidentified phase breaking mechanism .",

    "<S> we consider the corrections to the boltzmann theory of electrical transport arising from the coulomb interaction in disordered conductors . in this article </S>",
    "<S> the theory is formulated in terms of quasiclassical green s functions . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the formalism is equivalent to the conventional diagrammatic technique by deriving the well - known altshuler - aronov corrections to the conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the conventional approach , the quasiclassical theory has the advantage of being closer to the boltzmann theory , and also allows description of interaction effects in the transport across interfaces , as well as non - equilibrium phenomena in the same theoretical framework . as an example , by applying the zaitsev boundary conditions which were originally developed for superconductors , we obtain the @xmath0-theory of the coulomb blockade in tunnel junctions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we summarize recent results obtained for the non - equilibrium transport in thin films , wires and fully coherent conductors . </S>"
