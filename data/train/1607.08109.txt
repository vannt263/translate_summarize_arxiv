    "the spontaneous decay of nuclear particles , or the empirical evidences for the big bang , lead various authors @xcite to consider modifications of the principles of quantum mechanics in order to include time - asymmetry . despite a long standing effort",
    ", the need for these modifications is still debated . however , the debate stimulated the developments of theoretical tools and paradigms by a growing community of scientists .",
    "these tools recently found surprisingly applications in nonlinear physics and photonics @xcite .",
    "the time - asimmetric dynamics of quantum systems are also relevant in biophysics , fluid dynamics , network theory , entanglement generation and epigenetic studies ( see for example @xcite and the references therein ) . the decay from local maxima in the energetic landscape of complex systems",
    "is generically retained irreversible .",
    "however the origin of this irreversibility in the case of microscopic quantum structures , or in quantum inspired models of networks @xcite , is unconsidered so far @xcite .",
    "the leading theoretical background of time - asymmetric quantum mechanics ( ta - qm ) is the rhs , an enlarged hilbert space , which includes non - normalizable wave packets that get amplified , or decay exponentially with time .",
    "the paradigmatic model for ta - qm is the reversed harmonic oscillator ( rho ) .",
    "whithin standard qm the description of the evolution of a wavefunction may be done by using the continuous spectrum of the hamiltonian . in ta - qm",
    "one considers a rhs , and generalized eigenvalues with complex energies do have physical meanings @xcite .",
    "the corresponding non - normalizable eigenvectors are the so - called `` gamow vectors '' @xcite and form a numerable generalized basis for integrable functions .",
    "this discrete resummation of the continuous spectrum furnishes novel physical insights for the spontaneous decay of a wave packet . for example",
    ", one can predict the surprising result of the quantization of the decay rates , which has been experimentally observed in an optical emulation @xcite .",
    "a further intriguing outcome of the ta - qm is the fact that it unveils a particular structure in the phase space .",
    "namely , one can discriminate initial data in terms of their projection on the eigenvectors of the rho continuous spectrum .",
    "these projections engender different vector subspaces depending on specific hardy spaces .",
    "the question if this classification has direct physical counterpart has no answer at the moment , albeit mathematically this has important implications .",
    "if the initial wavefunction belongs to a particular space , it is completely represented by a numerable set of generalized eigenfunctions . on the contrary",
    ", the representation is given in terms of a finite number of gv and a background function .    despite these mathematical properties",
    "have been studied by several authors @xcite , a direct physical evidence of their implications is lacking , even in the simplest case of rho . in this manuscript",
    ", we review the basics of ta - qm and of the gv approach to the rho .",
    "moreover , we study the way the function space of the input wavefunctions has a direct counterpart in the long term evolution .",
