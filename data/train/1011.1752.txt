    "standard parametrisations of surfaces in computer aided geometric design are based on tensor product b - spline functions , defined from a grid of nodes over a rectangular domain @xcite .",
    "these representations are easy to control but their refinement has some drawback . inserting a node in one direction of the parameter domain implies the insertion of several control points in the other directions . if for instance , regions along the diagonal of the parameter domain should be refined , this would create a fine grid in some regions where it is not needed . to avoid this problem , while extending the standard tensor product representation of cagd , spline functions associated to a subdivision with t - junctions instead of a grid , have been studied .",
    "such a t - mesh is a partition of a domain @xmath4 into axis - aligned boxes , called the cells of the t - mesh .",
    "the first type of t - splines introduced in @xcite , are defined by blending functions which are products of univariate b - spline basis functions associated to some nodes of the subdivision .",
    "they are piecewise polynomial functions , but the pieces where these functions are polynomial do not match with the cells of the t - subdivision .",
    "moreover , there is no proof that these piecewise polynomial functions are linearly independent .",
    "indeed , @xcite shows that in some cases , these blending t - spline functions are not linearly independent .",
    "another issue related to this construction is that there is no characterization of the vector space spanned by these functions .",
    "for this reason , the partition of unity property which is useful in cagd is not available directly in this space .",
    "the spline functions have to be replaced by piecewise rational functions , so that these piecewise rational functions sum to @xmath5 .",
    "however , this construction complexifies the practical use of such t - splines .",
    "being able to describe a basis of the vector space of piecewise polynomials of a given smoothness on a t - mesh is an important but non - trivial issue .",
    "it yields a construction of piecewise polynomial functions on the t - subdivision which form a partition of unity so that the use of piecewise rational functions is not required .",
    "it has also a direct impact in approximation problems such as surface reconstruction @xcite or isogeometric analysis @xcite , where controlling the space of functions used to approximate a solution is critical . in cagd",
    ", it also provides more degrees of freedom to control a shape .",
    "this explains why further works have been developed to understand better the space of piecewise polynomial functions with given smoothness on a t - subdivision .",
    "to tackle these issues special families of splines on t - meshes have been studied . in @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "these splines are piecewise polynomial functions on a hierarchical t - subdivision .",
    "they are called pht - splines ( polynomial hierarchical t - splines ) .",
    "dimension formulae of the spline space on such a subdivision have been proposed when the degree is high enough compared to the smoothness @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and in some cases for biquadratic @xmath6 piecewise polynomial functions @xcite .",
    "the construction of a basis is described for bicubic @xmath6 spline spaces in terms of the coefficients of the polynomials in the bernstein basis attached to a cell .",
    "when a cell is subdivided into 4 subcells , the bernstein coefficients of the basis functions of the old level are modified and new linearly independent functions are introduced , using bernstein bases on the cells at the new level .    in this paper , we analyse the dimension of the space @xmath7 of bivariate functions that are piecewise polynomial of bi - degree @xmath8 of smoothness @xmath2 along the interior edges of a general planar t - mesh @xmath3 , where @xmath2 is a smoothness distribution on @xmath3 .",
    "as we will see , computing this dimension reduces to compute the dimension of the kernel of a certain linear map ( namely the map @xmath9 introduced in section [ sec:2 ] ) .",
    "thus for a given t - mesh , a given smoothness distribution @xmath2 and a given bi - degree @xmath10 , it is possible to compute the dimension of @xmath0 by linear algebra tools ( see eg . a software implementation developed by p. alfed for such computations ) .",
    "we would like to avoid a case - by - case treatment and to describe this dimension in terms of combinatorial quantities attached to @xmath3 and easy to evaluate .",
    "as shown in @xcite or @xcite , the dimension may also depend on the geometry of the t - mesh and not just on its topology .",
    "this explains why it is not always possible to provide a purely combinatorial formula for the dimension of @xmath0 .",
    "the main results in this paper are    * a description of the dimension in terms of a _ combinatorial _ part that depends only on the topology of the t - mesh and an _ homological _ part that takes into account the fact that the dimension may depend on the geometry of the t - mesh ( theorem [ thm : dim ] ) ; * _ combinatorial _ lower and upper bounds on the dimension that are easy to evaluate ( theorem [ thm : dim : bound ] ) ; * sufficient conditions under which the lower and upper bounds coincide so that the dimension depends only on the topology of the t - mesh ( theorem [ thm : weighted ] ) .",
    "we proceed as follows . by extending homological techniques developed in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we obtain combinatorial lower and upper bounds on the dimension of these spline spaces for general t - subdivisions .",
    "we relate the upper bound to the maximal interior segments and their weights and show that the lower and upper bounds coincide for @xmath11-meshes which are enough regular .",
    "namely , if a t - mesh is @xmath12-weighted , the dimension depends directly on the number of faces , interior edges and interior points .",
    "in particular , we obtain the dimension formula for a constant smoothness distribution @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , providing a new proof of a result also available in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for a hierarchical t - mesh .",
    "the algebraic approach gives an homological interpretation of the method called smoothing cofactor - conformality method in @xcite .",
    "it allows us to generalize the dimension formulae obtained by this technique @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we also give a rule of subdivision to construct hierarchical t - meshes for which the lower and upper bounds coincide .",
    "as a consequence , we can recover the dimension of the space of locally refined splines described in @xcite .",
    "we do not consider the problem of constructing explicit bases for these spline spaces , which will be analyzed separately .",
    "in the first section , we recall the notations and the polynomial properties which are needed in the following .",
    "section [ sec:2 ] describes the chain complex associated to the spline space and analyzes its homology . in section [ sec:3 ] , we give lower and upper bounds on the dimension of the spline space and analyze cases where these bounds are coincide . section [ sec:4 ] deals with the properties of hierarchical @xmath11-meshes , obtained by recursive subdivisions of cells . in the last section , we analyse some examples for small degree and smoothness .",
