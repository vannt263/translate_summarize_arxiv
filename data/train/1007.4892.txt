    "in this work we investigate the spatio - temporal structure of a family of stochastic interacting particle systems , specifically exclusion processes , in the case of the extreme event in which the system supports a very large current for an extended period of time , i.e. , while the system is in a state very far from typical behaviour . as this type of non - equilibrium behaviour does not have a long history of study in statistical mechanics , we first make some brief remarks on how this problem is situated in general terms in the study of the statistical properties of extreme events .",
    "then we state the precise problem that we are going to address .",
    "when studying statistical properties of extreme events @xcite , i.e. , of highly non - typical values of some physical observable in a many - body system with noisy dynamics , the first question to ask is the full probability distribution of that observable since one wishes to know not only fluctuations around its mean , but also the distribution very far from it . from that knowledge",
    "one may be able to infer knowledge on the extreme value statistics for that observable .",
    "then , a second problem of interest is the spatio - temporal patterns that generate such atypical values of observables over some period of time . even though very difficult to tackle , this is an important question since a good understanding of this aspect of non - equilibrium behaviour , which lies beyond a purely statistical description in terms of extreme value statistics , may give insight into the physical mechanisms that generate extreme events .",
    "one could potentially identify and apply forces to enhance the probability of such rare events . notice that in this setting we are not interested in searching for just _ any _ force that would make some rare large fluctuation of a physical observable typical but for those very specific forces that retain the spatio - temporal patterns of the original unforced process that generates these rare fluctuations by its own intrinsic random dynamics .",
    "conversely , if suitable forces would suppress the relevant space - time patterns , one could make such events even more unlikely .",
    "carrying out such an analysis is obviously very difficult even for relatively simple complex systems .",
    "however , this problem turns out to be interesting already in the context of simple exactly solvable statistical mechanics models . to be specific ,",
    "we consider in this work the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) @xcite and we look for the spatio - temporal patterns that generate an atypically large flux over a long period of time and for which effective hopping rates ( arising from some extrinsic applied force ) would generate such a state as typical stationary state .",
    "earlier exact work on currents below the typical value have revealed that long - lasting low - current events are supported by travelling waves which represent density profiles with two regions of constant densities @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "such spontaneous phase separation behaviour has earlier been suggested by fogedby @xcite who used renormalization group arguments to show that atypical low - current fluctuations are realized by a gas of shock and antishock solutions of the noisy burgers equation that describes the large scale behaviour of the asep . in the context of phase separation",
    "these shocks and antishocks are the domain walls that separate regions of high and low density . on a microscopic level",
    "the shocks are known to be sharp , the bulk properties of each phase are reached quickly within a small distance from the shock position @xcite .",
    "understanding how the particle system organizes itself microscopically for atypically _ large _ currents , and how such a microscopic structure could be generated as typical event by introducing suitable forces , requires a different and careful exact analysis .",
    "a step in this direction was done in recent work by simon @xcite , where the effective hopping rates of the particles in specific regimes of the asep with open boundaries were computed . to make further progress and to investigate an arbitrary number of particles we consider in the present work periodic boundary conditions . using bethe ansatz we compute the quasi - stationary distribution of the system conditioned on sustaining a large current and",
    "we obtain an exact effective interaction potential between particles that would make this quasi - stationary distribution stationary , i.e. typical .",
    "we also stress an interesting analogy with random matrix ensembles .",
    "it will transpire that for very large currents our results for the asep are rather generic .",
    "the results remain valid for all exclusion processes with nearest neighbour hopping , irrespective of the hopping asymmetry or even particle number conservation .",
    "hence our approach covers also e.g. reaction - diffusion processes of the type studied in @xcite .",
    "these include the well - known contact process , diffusion - limited annihilation , the coagulation / decoagulation model and other well - studied processes .",
    "moreover , the same results are valid for the limit of large hopping activity , irrespective of direction .",
    "we also point out an intriguing connection to quantum mechanical expectation values for free fermion systems .    the paper is organized as follows : in the following section ( [ approach ] ) we define the problem and present our approach .",
    "mainly for pedagogical reasons this is briefly illustrated for the case of just two particles ( sec .",
    "[ sec : twoparticles ] ) and then in detail for three particles in sec .",
    "[ sec : threeparticles ] . from these preliminaries",
    "we proceed to the investigation of an arbitrary number of particles in the limit of very large current in sec .",
    "[ sec : nparticles ] where our main results are derived .",
    "we finish with a brief summary and discuss generalizations of our results to other particle systems ( sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] ) .",
    "in the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) @xcite in one dimension with periodic boundary conditions and @xmath3 sites , particles jump independently after an exponentially distributed random time with mean @xmath4 to a nearest neighbor site , provided that the target site is empty .",
    "the probability to choose the right neighbour ( clockwise in a periodic chain ) is @xmath5 while the probability of choosing the left neighbour ( anticlockwise ) is @xmath6 . throughout the paper , we assume @xmath7 for notational simplicity . if the target site is occupied the jump attempt is rejected .",
    "this exclusion principle guarantees that each site is always occupied by at most one particle .",
    "an instantaneous configuration of this system with @xmath8 particles can therefore be represented by an ordered set of integer coordinates @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 for all @xmath12 .",
    "mathematically , the dynamics of the asep can be defined through a master equation for the probability @xmath13 to find a configuration @xmath14 at time @xmath15 starting from a configuration @xmath16 at time @xmath17 .",
    "the master equation takes the form @xmath18   , \\label{2 - 1}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the transition rate ( 0 , @xmath20 or @xmath21 for the asep ) to go from a configuration @xmath22 to a configuration @xmath23 . by integrating ( [ 2 - 1 ] )",
    "one obtains the solution of the master equation for any given initial configuration @xmath16 , i.e. , the conditional probability to find a particle configuration @xmath14 at time @xmath15 , given that the process started from configuration @xmath16 . in the stationary distribution of a system with @xmath8 particles , all particle configurations are equally likely .",
    "therefore , up to finite - size corrections of order @xmath24 , the stationary particle current has the simple form @xmath25 for particle density @xmath26 . for details , see e.g. @xcite . since the master equation can be used generally for describing markov processes we shall use at some places below the generic symbol @xmath27 for microscopic configuration of a process .    from the linear form of ( [ 2 - 1 ] )",
    "it is obvious that the master equation can be cast in matrix form @xmath28 where the probability vector @xmath29 has all the probabilities @xmath30 as its canonical components . in a conveniently chosen tensor basis",
    "the stochastic generator @xmath31 of the asep , often called `` quantum hamiltonian '' , takes the form @xcite @xmath32 = w_+ + w_- + w_0\\ ] ] here @xmath33 are the @xmath34 spin-1/2 ladder operators acting on site @xmath12 of the lattice and @xmath35 is the projection operator on states with a particle on site @xmath12 .",
    "the operators @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 correspond respectively to the pure right - jump generator , to the pure left - jump generator and the diagonal part ( see below for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the stationary distribution is encoded in the right eigenvector of @xmath31 corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue 0 .",
    "the process as defined above describes only the evolution of the microscopic particle configuration , but does not keep track of the current that flows during the evolution .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing another random variable which counts the number of jumps across a given bond @xmath39 of the lattice , see @xcite for a detailed description .",
    "then each time a particle jumps across that bond to the right ( left ) the value of the current counter is incremented ( decremented ) by one unit . after some time",
    "@xmath15 this random variable then provides the integrated current , i.e. , the total net number of jumps @xmath40 across bond site @xmath41 up to time @xmath15 . because of particle number conservation one may equivalently one may also count the total net number of jumps in the lattice .",
    "we denote this quantity by @xmath42 . by the law of large number",
    "one expects an asymptotically linear growth @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the stationary current of the asep .    with these definitions at hand we can sharpen the question of space - time realizations for extreme currents and define precisely our problem .",
    "following @xcite we consider histories such that for a given initial configuration a certain integrated current @xmath45 has flown until some large time @xmath46 .",
    "we then ask how the system behaves during a time interval @xmath47 $ ] such that both @xmath48 and @xmath49 are far from the initial time 0 and the final time @xmath46 . as shown in @xcite",
    "this is tantamount to computing an effective stochastic process that has @xmath50 as its typical current and computing the stationary distribution of that effective process .",
    "this yields the quasi stationary distribution of the original asep conditioned on sustaining an atypical average flux @xmath44 . before proceeding with the discussion of this distribution",
    "we make two short digressions , the significance of which will become clear immediately further below .",
    "first we point out that generally the generator of a stochastic process can be written @xmath51 where matrix elements @xmath52 of the off - diagonal matrix @xmath53 is given by the negative transition rates @xmath54 from a configuration @xmath27 to another configuration @xmath55 , while the diagonal matrix @xmath56 is given by the negative sum of rates out of a given configuration , i.e. , @xmath57 .",
    "this property ensures that all diagonal elements of @xmath31 are positive real numbers , while all off - diagonal elements are negative real numbers .",
    "conservation of probability is encoded in the fact that by construction the matrix elements in each column of @xmath31 sum up to 0 . from this property",
    "it follows that there is a left eigenvector @xmath58 with eigenvalue 0 where all components are equal to 1 .",
    "this property along with the positivity ( negativity ) and reality condition on the matrix elements guarantee that @xmath31 is the generator of some markovian stochastic dynamics .",
    "generalizing an observation made in @xcite we now consider an irreducible matrix @xmath59 with non - negative diagonal and non - positive off - diagonal part . by the perron - frobenius theorem its lowest eigenvalue , denoted @xmath60 below , is real and nondegenerate , and the respective left and right eigenvectors @xmath61 have all positive real components @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "let us define a diagonal matrix @xmath64 with the components @xmath65 on the diagonal and consider the transformed and shifted matrix @xmath66 it is easy to see that @xmath67 has an eigenvalue @xmath17 with a right eigenvector @xmath68 and left eigenvector @xmath69 with constant components equal to one .",
    "moreover , by construction all off - diagonal elements of @xmath67 are non - positive real numbers , while the diagonal of @xmath59 remains unchanged up the constant real - valued shift @xmath60 . hence the matrix @xmath67 is the generator of a markov process .",
    "the construction ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) thus provides a general recipe how to obtain a stochastic generator from a rather general family of non - degenerate matrices with non - positive real off - diagonal and non - negative real diagonal part .",
    "the stationary distribution can be written in terms of the lowest eigenvectors of @xmath59 as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the normalization that ensures that the sum of all probabilities is equal to 1 .",
    "we remark that for symmetric @xmath59 one has @xmath72 .",
    "then @xmath59 is also hermitian and therefore can be seen as the hamiltonian of some quantum system .",
    "we find it intriguing that in such a case the stationary distribution of the associated classic stochastic dynamics defined by the markov generator @xmath67 is given by the quantum mechanical , i.e. , quadratic probability distribution of the quantum system .",
    "the classical interpretation of the presence of both the left and right eigenvectors in this formula is the following  : conditioning on an atypical current up to a final time @xmath46 requires to produce this current both between @xmath17 and @xmath15 and between @xmath15 and @xmath73 .",
    "computations made in @xcite show that the left eigenvector take into account the first part @xmath74 $ ] whereas the right one takes into account the second part @xmath75 $ ] ; there are both a forward - in - time and a backward - in - time effect of the global conditioning .",
    "next we comment specifically on the current distribution @xmath76 $ ] in the asep .",
    "we introduce the time - averaged current @xmath77 , sometimes simply called current , as opposed to the integrated current @xmath45 .",
    "asymptotically the current distribution has the large deviation form @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the large deviation function . introducing the auxiliary parameter @xmath80 conjugate to the integrated current one obtains the scaled asymptotic cumulant function @xmath81 which is given by the largest eigenvalue of the modified rate matrix@xcite @xmath82 here @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the off - diagonal part of the generator of the asep , corresponding to moves to the right and left resp . ,",
    "and @xmath85 $ ] is the diagonal part .",
    "thus one obtains the modified rate matrix from the original generator @xmath31 ( [ 2 - 3 ] ) simply by multiplying all off - diagonal elements with @xmath86 .",
    "notice the sign convention that we adopt here to remain consistent with @xcite : for @xmath87 we have @xmath88 .",
    "the two large deviation functions @xmath79 and @xmath89 are related by a legendre transformation @xmath90 .",
    "\\label{2 - 9}\\ ] ] this construction is in complete analogy to a change between ensembles in equilibrium thermodynamics where @xmath45 would be regarded as extensive variable ( here : extensive in time ) whereas @xmath80 would be the conjugate intensive quantity . on the one hand one might want to study for a given time @xmath15 space - time histories with a fixed value of @xmath91 .",
    "alternatively , one could study the transformed ensemble where @xmath45 is fluctuating , and the conjugate quantity @xmath80 is chosen fixed such that the current has the same mean value @xmath92 by construction this conditional current  is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath80 and it coincides at the point @xmath87 with the stationary current of the asep .",
    "so positive ( negative ) values of @xmath80 correspond to an atypical current enhanced ( reduced ) with respect to the typical stationary current of the asep .",
    "equivalently one may write @xmath93 to obtain the inverse relation between @xmath80 and @xmath44 .    with these notions",
    "we can address the question of how the asep , conditioned to produce an atypical current @xmath44 during a long period of time , behaves dynamically .",
    "we consider this question in the ensemble of fixed @xmath80 rather than fixed @xmath44 where for a given @xmath44 the conjugate value of @xmath80 is given by ( [ 2 - 11 ] ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite the general construction presented in our digression can be used to solve this problem .",
    "the rates of the effective markov process are expressed in terms of the left eigenvector of the modified rate matrix ( [ modifiedratematrix ] ) corresponding to its largest eigenvalue as @xmath94 here @xmath95 , @xmath96 are rates of change @xmath97 in the original and in the effective stochastic process",
    ". the unnormalized stationary state vector of the effective process is given by ( [ 2 - 6 ] ) and can be written in bra - ket notation as @xmath98 the stationary flux ( [ 2 - 10 ] ) of the effective stochastic process is equal to the atypical flux , on which the original stochastic process is conditioned .    from a probabilistic point of view , the transformation from the initial markov process to the conditioned one with the modified matrix @xmath99 correspond to a change of measure .",
    "the expectation value under the new process of any observable @xmath100 at time @xmath15 can be expressed as : @xmath101 the existence of the limit and its relation to the conditioning under the current are deduced from the large deviation principle satisfied by the current @xmath102 .",
    "such a change of measure makes explicit the conjugation relation between the parameter @xmath80 and the current @xmath42 , similar to equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "so , if we succeed to solve the largest eigenvalue problem for the modified rate matrix ( [ modifiedratematrix ] ) , the effective stochastic process and its respective stationary state can be constructed .",
    "the aim of this paper is to construct such an effective stochastic process for the asep on a ring , conditioned to produce a high particle current .",
    "the stationary distribution of the unconditioned asep does not have long - range correlations and the process itself has only has hard - core on - site interaction . conditioning the process on an atypical high flux , one expects that the respective space - time particle trajectories ( for long periods when this high flux can be observed ) , avoid forming clusters , thus generating an effective repulsive interaction . in this paper",
    "we find the analytical form of such interaction for very high fluxes .",
    "the asep is chosen for simplicity of presentation , but it will transpire that our results are generalizable to non - conservative simple exclusion processes with nearest neighbour hopping , i.e. to a class of reaction - diffusion processes .",
    "we consider first the special cases of two and three particles on a ring of @xmath3 sites , and then generalize to the case of an arbitrary number of particles @xmath8 . for calculations we use the fact that the modified rate matrix for the asep belongs for all @xmath80 to the class of integrable models whose eigenfunctions can be found using the bethe ansatz .",
    "we stress that three different connections of classical stochastic processes to quantum mechanics are described in this work .",
    "they are independent from each other and have their own meaning .",
    "the first one presented in the previous section is the quantum hamiltonian formalism to describe the evolution of the probability distribution .",
    "it arises from the markov property of the stochastic process , in particular from the linearity of the temporal evolution of the process .",
    "however , the classical probabilities are linear in the right eigenvector , while quantum mechanical expectations are quadratic . the second connection , which is _ new _ , stems from the effective dynamics where the conditioned expectation values are now quadratic in the eigenvectors ( see ) as in quantum expectations .",
    "this fact is independent of the previous quantum formalism .",
    "finally , the determinantal free fermion structure described in the next sections for a large current is also a _ new _ feature of the present regime of the exclusion process and is not a direct consequence of the two previous facts .",
    "the eigenfunction of the modified rate matrix @xmath103 is found using the coordinate bethe ansatz ( for the present context see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath104 and the amplitude @xmath105 is given by requirement that @xmath106 is an eigenfunction for particles being nearest neighbours @xmath107 moreover , periodic boundary conditions require @xmath108    the translation invariance of the problem together with the constant sign of the components of the ground state yields @xmath109 and therefore @xmath110 for the ground state . it is convenient to parametrize @xmath111 .",
    "then ( [ a21per ] ) is a transcendental equation which has @xmath3 solutions for @xmath112 .",
    "the amplitude corresponding to a configuration with two particles at distance @xmath113 follows as @xmath114    we have to determine that value of @xmath112 that gives the largest eigenvalue . from the fact that the largest eigenvalue @xmath115 is real",
    ", it follows that @xmath112 is either real or imaginary . @xmath112 as function of @xmath80 is determined by solving ( [ a21 ] ) with substitution ( [ a21per ] ) . for @xmath80 close to @xmath17 , it turns out that real @xmath112 corresponds to @xmath116 and imaginary @xmath112 corresponds to @xmath117 . for large @xmath118",
    ", @xmath112 is real and the bethe amplitude @xmath119 ( [ y_n , n+l ] ) of the largest right and left eigenvectors is given by @xmath120 the origin of the above formula will be explained in the section [ sec : nparticles ] .",
    "the case of two particles was treated as an introductory pedagogical example . in this section",
    "we study the case of three particles in more detail .",
    "the eigenfunction of the modified rate matrix @xmath103 for @xmath121 particles on a ring is given by the bethe ansatz @xmath122 where @xmath123 are the @xmath124 permutations of indices @xmath125 .",
    "this eigenfunction has eigenvalues@xmath126 and the amplitudes @xmath127 are given by requirement that @xmath128 is an eigenfunction for particles being nearest neighbours @xcite ) .",
    "this yields e.g. @xmath129 and similar relations for any other permutation of two indices . from the periodic boundary conditions it follows that @xmath130 for all @xmath12 .    as in the previous case @xmath131 , from translation invariance for the ground state components",
    "we have @xmath132 we get @xmath133 , so we have only two unknown parameters .",
    "they must be found from the bethe ansatz equations ( [ betheansatz ] ) and the requirement of maximization of the eigenvalue @xmath134 . using ( [ betheamplitudesratio ] ) , ( [ betheansatz ] ) , and @xmath133 , the bethe amplitudes @xmath135 for @xmath136 may be brought to the form @xmath137+a_{213}[1\\leftrightarrow2 ] \\label{asep3_righteigenvector}\\ ] ] where @xmath138 , and @xmath139 $ ] stands for the substitution @xmath140 in the expression inside the first square brackets in ( [ asep3_righteigenvector ] ) .",
    "consider the limit @xmath118 , which corresponds to a dynamic restriction on an atypically large current .",
    "treating @xmath141 as a small parameter , we can write the bethe equations in the form @xmath142 we look for the solution for @xmath143 in the form @xmath144 . we choose @xmath145 as @xmath146 this choice leads to the maximal eigenvalue we are searching ( basically , we have to pick up the set of @xmath143 with the largest real part ) .",
    "note that in the following we shall also assume the large @xmath3 limit @xmath147 .",
    "solving self - consistently the bethe equations , we obtain after some algebra @xmath148 , so that @xmath149    the respective maximal eigenvalue of the modified rate matrix is given by @xmath150 where @xmath151 the respective magnitude of the enhanced current is @xmath152 .",
    "so indeed the choice @xmath118 corresponds to large atypical current .    substituting the solution of the bethe equations ( [ asep3 ] ) into ( [ asep3_righteigenvector ] )",
    ", we obtain the right eigenfunction @xmath153 , which corresponds to a configuration with @xmath154 particles , separated by distances @xmath155 where @xmath156 .",
    "the result is ( up to an overall constant ) @xmath157 where @xmath158 , or , alternatively , as @xmath159    the left eigenfunction turns out to be the same as the right eigenfunction , which can be demonstrated either from the gallavotti - cohen symmetry or by the following argument .",
    "the transposition of the matrix @xmath160 results in the exchanging @xmath161 in the original matrix @xmath162 . denote the bethe roots of the transposed matrix as @xmath163 .",
    "in can be verified that the bethe ansatz equations and eigenvalue of the transposed matrix coincide with the old ones ( [ betheamplitudesratio ] ) , ( [ asep3eigenvalue ] ) , after substitution @xmath164 for all @xmath12 . under these substitutions ,",
    "the amplitudes of the left eigenfunction become @xmath165 .",
    "however , note from ( [ asep3 ] ) that @xmath166 , and @xmath167 up to corrections @xmath168 .",
    "therefore , by relabelling the roots @xmath169 we obtain @xmath170 .    with that in mind , we are in a position to construct the _ effective stochastic dynamics _ , defined by ( [ effectivedynamicsrate ] ) conditioned on large flux .    to this end , notice first that the stationary probabilities to find the configuration of particles at distances @xmath155 , is given by ( [ effectivedynamicsstationarystate ] ) @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the normalization factor .",
    "with ( [ y123_product ] ) it is readily checked that    * * ( a ) * the configuration with @xmath173 is the most probable one * * ( b ) * all configurations with _ any _ single finite distance @xmath174 .",
    "i.e. , where @xmath175 , and arbitrary other distances @xmath176 have vanishing probability    indeed , this is consistent with the intuition that the configurations where two particles are coming near each other ( close on lattice scale ) should be avoided in the effective stochastic dynamics , because it would tend to cause a current reduction due to hard - core repulsion .",
    "the rates for the _ effective stochastic dynamics _ are given by ( [ effectivedynamicsrate ] ) .",

    "we see that the rates ( [ favourablerates ] ) driving two particles apart are larger than those driving them together ( [ unfavourablerates ] ) , and therefore the configurations with two particles forming a cluster are difficult to reach . however , in any finite system @xmath189 , even in the limit @xmath190 , configurations with particle distances ( @xmath191 ) are possible .",
    "it is instructive at this point to compare the probability of forming of a cluster in the model with the effective dynamics and in the original asep . in the model with the effective dynamics",
    "the single - cluster probability is @xmath192 and the probability of a cluster of two particles is@xmath193 on the other hand in the original unconstrained asep with @xmath154 particles on a ring , the probability to form a single cluster is @xmath194 for @xmath147 , and the probability to form a cluster of two particles is @xmath195 for @xmath147 .",
    "so we see that the clustering is strongly suppressed in the effective dynamics , with respect to the unforced asep , which is natural to expect in  a system conditioned to produce a large current . on the other hand ,",
    "the stationary probability of equidistant state @xmath173 ( the most probable state in the effective dynamics ) @xmath196 is only @xmath197 times larger than in the unconstrained asep @xmath198 for @xmath147 .",
    "finally , we can define an _ effective potential _",
    "@xmath199 , felt by the particles evolving according to the effective stochastic dynamics , in obvious analogy with equilibrium thermodynamics , by@xmath200 where @xmath201 is the effective inverse temperature .",

    "although the similarity is striking , a deep understanding of the connection between both models and the existence of further similarities ( dynamical fluctuations , corrections in @xmath141 ) are still missing .",
    "let us consider a special case of finite number of particles @xmath8 , which form a _",

    "such a choice corresponds to a minimal modification in the set ( [ gamma_k ] ) and it is inherited from the underlying free fermion quantum system .    computing the difference between the eigenvalues @xmath313 and @xmath314 given by the set ( [ gamma_k ] ) and the new set , we obtain to leading order in @xmath315 the real part of the spectral gap of @xmath308 , as @xmath316    &   \\sim p{\\mbox{\\rm e}}^{s}(\\cos\\pi(\\rho-\\frac{1}{l})-\\cos\\pi(\\rho+\\frac{1}{l } ) ) \\nonumber\\\\ &   = 2 p { \\mbox{\\rm e}}^{s}\\sin{\\frac{\\pi}{l}}\\sin\\pi\\rho \\label{spectrumgap}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the particle density . since our choice of bethe roots corresponds to @xmath214 limit , we see that for large @xmath3 the gap in the rescaled effective hamiltonian is inversely proportional to the system size @xmath317 .",
    "note that in the unconstrained asep the real part of the spectrum gap scales as @xmath318 .",
    "we conclude that the long - range interaction of the effective process leads to a marked reduction of the longest relaxation time ( which is the inverse spectral gap ) .",
    "we have shown that conditioning the asep on a long period of strongly enhanced current can be described in terms of an effective exclusion process with long range interactions .",
    "numerical evaluation of bethe ansatz equations and perturbation theory in @xmath319 show that the explicit asymptotic results that we have obtained for very large fluxes are rather robust with respect to the value of @xmath80 , at least for finite number of particles @xmath320 and large system sizes @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , as can be seen in fig.[fig_ufor2 ] , the effective two - particles potential @xmath251 for @xmath321 is difficult to distinguish from the limit @xmath322 for @xmath323 . for @xmath324 , the differences from the limiting case would become visible in fig.[fig_ufor2 ] only at values @xmath325 and higher ( curves not shown ) .",

    "the hopping rates corresponding to the limiting effective dynamics have been computed explicitly , see ( [ e^-sw ] ) .",
    "they can be interpreted as arising from an equilibrium potential that depends only on the interparticle distance .",
    "we have computed various space - time properties of the dynamics conditioned to carry a large current for a long time , i.e. , of the quasi - stationary distribution .",
    "density correlations decay with a power law and have a periodic modulation ( [ particle - particlecorrelation ] ) .",
    "temporal correlations decay with a dynamical exponent @xmath327 rather than with the kpz exponent @xmath328 that characterizes the typical behaviour of the asep .",
    "hence in the extreme - current regime the process is in a different universality class , indicating a phase transition as one enters into the regime of strongly non - typical behaviour .",
    "non - analytic behaviour of physical observables in the regime of strong non - typical behaviour has been shown to occur also for atypical small currents and in the zero - range process for high currents .",
    "our approach highlights a surprising analogy between the _ classical _ stochastic problem we have started from with an intrinsically _ quantum _ problem of @xmath8 free fermions on a periodic lattice .",
    "this analogy goes far beyond the quantum formalism used in section [ approach ] to describe the stochastic classical dynamics .",
    "in fact , the expression ( [ slaterdeterminant ] ) , and , correspondingly , also ( [ sinvandermonde ] ) is a slater determinant describing the wave function of a system of free fermions , the so - called @xmath329 model,@xmath330 with periodic boundary conditions @xmath331 .",
    "the probabilities of the _ classical _ particle configurations under effective dynamics given by @xmath332 , coincide , up to terms of order @xmath141 , with _",
    "expectation values for the free fermion problem because of the presence of both left and right eigenvectors , whereas the unconditioned probability involves only the right eigenvector .",
    "the reason why the free fermion hamiltonian has a common eigenvector with the modified rate matrix in the limit @xmath333 is simple : in this limit , the modified rate matrix becomes @xmath334 , which commutes with @xmath329 hamiltonian .",
    "our asymptotic results are not limited to the asep and they are also not limited to conditioning on the current .",
    "one would obtain the same spatio - temporal organization of the particle system in the limit of large activity , i.e. , counting the number of jumps irrespective of direction .",
    "in that case the modified rate matrix ( [ modifiedratematrix ] ) would take the form @xmath335 . in this case the limit @xmath336 would directly lead to the @xmath329 hamiltonian ( [ hxx0 ] ) .",
    "similarly one can study non - conservative exclusion processes where particles can be created or annihilated , see e.g. the 16-parameter family of reaction diffusion processes defined in @xcite .",
    "this includes diffusion - limited annihilation , the contact process and other well - studied processes .",
    "for all these processes the quasi - stationary distribution for large current or activity is the same as for the asep computed here . hence our asymptotic results apply to a large family of interacting particle systems .",
    "the connection to the circular unitary ensemble for @xmath337 and the already known connections of the asep with the gaussian unitary ensemble raise the question of further connections with random matrices .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to perform the first corrections in @xmath141 of the effective probability @xmath338 , in order to check if it corresponds to the corrections of some potential on the unitary group @xmath281 .",
