    "it is noted that , other than the light charged particles , @xmath152sn has the larger level density .",
    "this ascertains the fact that with larger the phase space the ternary combinations becomes more probable than the other ternary fragments .",

    "@xmath0cf we obtained the sn + ni + ca as the most probable ternary combination at the temperatures @xmath6 2 and 3 mev .",
    "for the nuclei @xmath1pu and @xmath2u , however , we obtained few different fragmentations at @xmath6 2 and 3 mev .",
    "for these nuclei , at @xmath6 2 mev , the si / p / s are the possible ternary fragments along with the corresponding fragments . for @xmath6 3 mev , the oxygen isotopes have the larger yield values .",
    "the trmf results for the @xmath0cf at @xmath193 and 3 mev resemble very well with those for the frdm . whereas , they strikingly differ from each other at @xmath194 mev . in the case of @xmath2u ,",

    "the mass distributions for the trmf model and frdm are by and large at variance at all the temperatures considered .",
    "thus , it seems that the mass distribution of the fission fragments are quite sensitive to the effects on the excitation energy and the level density parameter due to the thermal evolution of the deformation and the single - particle energies .",
