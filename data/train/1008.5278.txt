    "the magnetic field at the visible surface of the sun is known to take the form of bipolar regions and the field continues in an arch - like fashion .",
    "these formations appear usually as twisted loop - like structures .",
    "these loops can be thought of as a continuation of more concentrated flux ropes in the bulk of the solar convection zone .",
    "twisted magnetic fields are produced by a large - scale dynamo mechanism that is generally believed to be the motor of solar activity ( parker 1979 ) .",
    "one such dynamo mechanism is the @xmath0 effect that produces a large - scale poloidal magnetic field from a toroidal one . in order to study the emergence of helical magnetic fields from a dynamo , we consider a model that combines a direct simulation of a turbulent large - scale dynamo with a simple treatment of the evolution of nearly force - free magnetic fields above the surface of the dynamo . in the context of force - free magnetic field extrapolations",
    "this method is also known as the stress - and - relax method ( valori et al .",
    "2005 ) . above the solar surface",
    ", we expect the magnetic fields to drive flares and coronal mass ejections through the lorentz force . in the present paper",
    "we highlight some of the main results of our earlier work ( warnecke & brandenburg 2010 ) .",
    "the equation for the velocity correction in the force - free model is similar to the usual momentum equation , except that there is no pressure , gravity , or other driving forces on the right - hand side , so we just have @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the lorentz force , @xmath3 is the current density , @xmath4 is the vacuum permeability , @xmath5 is the viscous force , and @xmath6 is here treated as a constant the determines the strength of the velocity correction .",
    "equation  ( [ dudtext ] ) is solved together with the induction equation . in the lower layer",
    "the velocity is excited by a forcing function and the density is evolving using the continuity equation .",
    "the forcing function consists of random plane helical transversal waves with an average forcing wavenumber @xmath7 .",
    "the magnetic field grows first exponentially and then shows subsequent saturation that is typical for forced turbulent dynamo action . in the turbulent layer the magnetic field reaches around @xmath8 of the equipartition field strength , @xmath9 .",
    "the dynamo generates a large - scale field whose vertical component has a sinusoidal variation in @xmath10 . after some time the magnetic field extends well into the exterior where it tends to produce an arcade - like structure , as seen in the left panel of figure  [ ai ] .",
    "the arcade opens up in the middle above the line where the vertical field component vanishes at the surface .",
    "this leads to the formation of anti - aligned field lines with a current sheet in the middle .",
    "the dynamical evolution is seen clearly in a sequence of field line images in the left hand panel of figure  [ ai ] , where anti - aligned vertical field lines reconnect above the neutral line and form a closed arch with plasmoid ejection above .",
    "this arch then changes its connectivity at the foot points in the sideways direction ( here the @xmath10 direction ) , making the field lines bulge upward to produce a new reconnection site with anti - aligned field lines some distance above the surface .",
    "field line reconnection is best seen for two - dimensional magnetic fields , because it is then possible to compute a flux function whose contours correspond to field lines in the corresponding plane . in the present case",
    "the large - scale component of the magnetic field varies only little in the @xmath11 direction , so it makes sense to visualize the field averaged in the @xmath11 direction .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ ai ] shows clearly the recurrent reconnection events with subsequent plasmoid ejection .     increasing from red ( positive ) to pink ( negative ) .",
    "the normalized time @xmath12 is giving in each panel .",
    "_ right panel _ : time series of the formation of a plasmoid ejection .",
    "contours of @xmath13 are shown together with a color - scale representation of @xmath14 ; dark blue stands for negative and red for positive values .",
    "the contours of @xmath13 correspond to field lines of @xmath15 in the @xmath16 plane.the dotted horizontal lines show the location of the surface at @xmath17 . adapted from warnecke & brandenburg ( 2010 ) .",
