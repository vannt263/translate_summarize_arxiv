    "matter wave interferometers for electrons @xcite have significantly improved in the last decades .",
    "they are applied to measure the rotational phase shift due to the sagnac effect @xcite , to study coulomb - induced quantum decoherence @xcite , the magnetic aharonov - bohm effect @xcite or the talbot - lau effect for magnetic field sensing @xcite .",
    "the topic is influenced by recent technical innovations and improvements concerning the beam source @xcite , the precise electron guiding @xcite , the coherent beam path separation @xcite and the development of spatial and temporal single - particle detection methods @xcite .",
    "the progress has potential novel applications in electron microscopy @xcite and sensor technology for inertial forces @xcite , mechanical vibrations @xcite and electromagnetic frequencies @xcite .",
    "small deviations of the partial waves in the two separated beam paths in a matter wave interferometer lead to a clear phase shift on the detector after they get superposed .",
    "this simple feature makes interferometric measurements extremely sensitive towards external perturbations .",
    "in contrast to neutral atoms , the phase of electron matter waves can be shifted not only by mechanical vibrations , temperature drifts or rotations of the setup but also by external electromagnetic frequencies .",
    "usually , these perturbations lead to a time dependent dephasing , causing a `` wash - out '' of the temporally integrated interference pattern that can be observed in a reduced interference contrast .",
    "this is particularly a challenge for sensitive long - time phase measurements such as proposed for the measurement of the electric aharonov - bohm effect @xcite , for decoherence measurements @xcite or the interferometry of ions @xcite .",
    "we recently demonstrated in a biprism electron interferometer @xcite that such dephasing effects can on the one hand be corrected and on the other hand used for an accurate measurement of the perturbation frequencies @xcite .",
    "thereby , the dephasing was detected and reduced with the high spatial and temporal single - particle resolution of a delay line detector @xcite . a second - order correlation analysis in combination with a fourier analysis",
    "was performed on the detection events after the interference was recorded .",
    "it can reveal multifrequency electromagnetic oscillations and mechanical vibrations .",
    "the spectrum of the unknown external frequencies , their amplitudes , the interference contrast and the pattern periodicity can be extracted from a spatially `` washed - out '' pattern @xcite .",
    "for that reason electron matter wave interferometers have a high potential in sensor technology .",
    "however , due to their large dimensions current experimental setups are not suitable for portable sensor applications @xcite . to apply an electron interferometer as a sensor for electromagnetic and vibrational frequencies or for the mobile analysis of the coherence of a beam source , it is necessary to construct a small and transportable device .    in this article",
    "we present a compact biprism matter wave interferometer for free electrons with minimized distances between all parts and a high mechanical stability .",
    "the distance between the tip and the superposition plane before magnification is only including all components for beam guiding and diffraction .",
    "in combination with the recently developed tools for spectrum analysis by correlation theory @xcite , the compact setup is an important prerequisite for a portable , mobile sensor based on matter wave interferometry with electrons .",
    "the setup of the biprism interferometer is illustrated in fig .",
    "the source for coherent electrons is a field emission tip that can be prepared by pulsed etching of a polycrystalline tungsten wire @xcite .",
    "the beam gets aligned by two deflection electrodes to coherently illuminate a biprism fiber .",
    "it acts as a beamsplitter for the electron matter waves , if a small positive voltage is applied on the fiber .",
    "the electric force bends the separated beam paths towards each other and superimposes them in front of a magnifying quadrupole lens .",
    "the key feature of the electron biprism , analogue to the optical biprism , is that all possible beam paths get deflected by the same angle , leading to a common angle of superposition at the entrance of the quadrupole @xcite .",
    "the superposition of the two partial beams leads to an interference pattern parallel to the biprism fiber .",
    "the interferogram has a typical pattern periodicity of several hundred nanometers and needs to be magnified by the quadrupole lens to fit the spatial resolution of the multi - channel plate ( mcp ) detector .",
    "such lenses are optimal suited for biprism interferometry since it is only necessary to magnify the pattern in the direction normal to the interferences",
    ". a small misalignment of the biprism fiber towards the magnifying axis , can be corrected by an image rotating coil . in our experiment , a drift distance of between the exit aperture of the quadrupole lens and the mcps of the detector was chosen .",
    "the electron signal gets amplified by the mcp and detected by a hexagonal delay line @xcite with a spatial and temporal resolution of @xmath0 and @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "an image of the interferometer is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the whole setup is fixed between two grounded copper half - shells with a length of and an outer diameter of .",
    "some individual parts are identical or based on constructions used in interferometers by hasselbach et al .",
    "the field emission tungsten tip is spot welded on a commercial holder and has a typical radius between and .",
    "the length of the tip profile and the radius can be controlled by the parameters in the etching process @xcite .",
    "the tip is positioned in front of an aperture of diameter acting as a grounded counter electrode .",
    "its distance to the biprism is @xmath1 = and to the entrance of the quadrupole lens @xmath2 = .",
    "the tip emits electrons with an acceleration voltage of into a double deflector module , consisting of four pairs of flat deflection electrodes with a length of and oriented around the beam with a distance of between them .",
    "the positive and negative voltage applied between two opposing electrode pairs is equal to keep a zero potential on the beam axis .",
    "the biprism fiber consists of a glass fiber with a diameter of that was manufactured by a special procedure described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it is coated with a gold - palladium alloy to ensure a smooth , conductive surface and is glued on a holder isolated by a non - conductive foil .",
