    "extinction of light plays a major role in the observation of any astronomical object , but even more so for intermediate- and high - redshift ones due to the intrinsically fainter signals and our poorer understanding of the dust physics involved . in the optical range of wavelengths ,",
    "dust grains are the dominant contributor to extinction .",
    "high - quality extinction curves have been constructed for our galaxy ( the milky way ; mw ) , as well as for the small and large magellanic clouds ( smc and lmc ; e.g. , cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ; pei 1992 ; weingartner & draine 2001 ) .    despite the importance of the subject ,",
    "surprisingly little is presently known about the extinction properties of dust grains in the universe at redshifts of @xmath3 .",
    "some constraints on the properties of dust have been obtained for active galactic nuclei ( agn ; laor & draine 1993 ) and starburst galaxies at low redshifts ( calzetti 1997 ) .",
    "nevertheless , our knowledge of the composition and grain size distribution of dust in intermediate- and high-@xmath4 galaxies is very limited .",
    "the only constraints set on some intermediate-@xmath4 galaxies ( @xmath5 to 0.9 ) were obtained through the analysis of multi - imaged quasars ( qsos ) behind a lensing galaxy ( falco et al .",
    "1999 ; motta et al . 2002",
    "; muoz et al .",
    "these studies utilize the fact that the lensed images have the same intrinsic spectrum .",
    "the extinction curves , which are measured and characterized by a cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) profile , range from flat ( `` gray '' ) to steep , smc - like profiles , both with and without the 2175  feature .",
    "other studies have derived attenuation curves , obtained by substituting a source population  for which an average , intrinsic spectrum can be safely assumed  for the point - like source .",
    "notable results were achieved by calzetti ( 1997 ) for starburst galaxies and by johnson et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for a sample of 1000 _ sloan digital sky survey _ ( sdss ) galaxies .",
    "strikingly , the former and latter studies yielded gray and smc - like attenuation ( or `` effective extinction '' ) curves , respectively .",
    "these studies leave open the question of whether the inferred diversity stems from intrinsic differences in the dust properties or is an effect of hidden ( and incorrect ) assumptions in the utilized methods .",
    "our relatively poor knowledge of dust physics at @xmath3 makes it difficult to derive the fundamental properties of intermediate- and high-@xmath4 galaxies such as the star formation rate ( or at least its obscured fraction ) , the metallicity of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , the rate of supernova ( sn ) explosions , and the extinction - corrected luminosity of any galactic source of light .",
    "our level of understanding of dust physics in our galaxy shows us what can be learned if high - quality extinction curves are available .",
    "studying the extinction properties of the ism in the mw has provided insight into dust composition , which has in turn taught us about grain coagulation and destruction , metal depletion ( into dust ) , and grain polarization properties ( e.g. , mathis , rumpl & nordsieck 1977 ; weingartner & draine 2001 ; draine & li 2007 ) .",
    "these pioneering studies have set the stage for asking whether mw dust physics is unique to our galaxy or evolves with redshift .",
    "differences between the mw , smc and lmc extinction laws suggest that grain properties probably vary with the local radiation field , metallicity and galactic mass , but the lack of more examples has hampered any further conclusions .    measuring",
    "the extinction curve at intermediate- or high-@xmath4 is a formidable task , due to the rarity of sources with known spectra and luminosities .",
    "the discovery of @xmath6-ray bursts ( grbs ) and their afterglows , about a decade ago , has opened a new window into the study of dust physics . in particular ,",
    "long - duration grbs are believed to occur in dusty environments , since it is thought that they result from the deaths of very massive stars .",
    "their afterglows have featureless , power - law spectra ( e.g. , liang et al . 2007 ) and intense luminosities ( @xmath7 to @xmath8 erg s@xmath9 ) , easily outshining a typical qso ( @xmath10 erg s@xmath9 ) .",
    "it has been previously demonstrated that the study of the infrared ( ir ) , optical , ultraviolet ( uv ) and x - ray afterglows of a grb can place constraints on the extinction by dust present within the host galaxy ( e.g. , price et al . 2002 ; starling et al .",
    "however , these studies lacked an unbiased measurement of the unabsorbed spectrum and its normalization , restricting the analyses to only fitting known extinction laws to the data , rather than directly measure the dust extinction .    in this paper , we pioneer a method that is similar in spirit to the previous studies , but uses less assumptions . for our study , we focus on grb 050525a , the first detection of a grb at mid - ir wavelengths with the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( garnavich et al .",
    "we demonstrate that by constructing a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the grb afterglow which includes ir and x - ray data points , one can derive an extinction curve without having to assume a known dust extinction law . in other words",
    ", our method allows a template - independent calibration of the extinction curve .",
    "we emphasize that such an approach is well - suited for observatories that are capable of simultaneously observing grb afterglows in multiple wavebands ( e.g. , _ grond _ ) .",
    "in  [ sect : observations ] , we describe the ir , optical , uv and x - ray observations used in our study . our _ spitzer _ ir observations at @xmath1 days are not contemporaneous with the optical , uv and x - ray observations used , which motivates a description , in ",
    "[ sect : lightcurves ] , of our light curve fitting procedure that interpolates for the optical , uv and x - ray sed data points at @xmath2 .",
    "using our constructed sed , we derive an extinction curve for the host galaxy of grb 050525a in  [ sect : results ] ; we further analyze its dust - to - gas ratio if known extinction laws are fitted to our curve .",
    "finally , we compare our results to that of previous studies , discuss their implications and present opportunities for future work in  [ sect : discussion ] .",
    "grb 050525a occurred at 00:02:53 ut on 2005 may 25th ( band et al . 2005 ) at a redshift of @xmath11 ( foley et al . 2005 ) .",

    "grb 050525a is thought to be observed on - axis and is associated with supernova ( sn ) 2005nc ; d06 proposed that a bump in the @xmath21 band light curve at @xmath24 20 days is due to a sn contribution peaking at between 10 and 20 days .",
    "we therefore consider @xmath21 band data only up to about 5 days .",

    "imaging and spectroscopy began on may 27.264 ( ut ) at @xmath27s @xmath28 days post - burst .",
    "we obtained measurements ( table [ tab : spitzer ] ) from the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath29 m _ irac _ channels , and from the 24.0 @xmath29 m _ mips _ channel , using the latest _",
    "spitzer science center _ pipeline products ( s16 ; 2007 dec ) .",
    "the most current flux calibration was used ( engelbracht et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the data required very little post - processing beyond the standard products , because the source was placed at the center of the array ( engelbracht et al .",
    "an aperture photometry measurement was carried out using a 7radius at the position of the source ( ra = 18h32m32.58s , dec = 26d20m22.5s , j2000 ) that required an aperture correction of 2.05 ( table 1 in engelbracht et al .",
    "2007 ) to recover all of the flux .",
    "the selected aperture radius reduces the light contamination by a nearby source ; for the same reason , the background was measured on a comparable area @xmath30 away from grb 050525a .",
    "the optical and ultraviolet contributions from the host galaxy are at the @xmath31 level on average , especially at early times ( b06 ) .",
    "there is a definitive measurement of the host galaxy contribution only in the @xmath21 band : @xmath32 mag ( d06 ) .",
    "since the x - ray and other optical / uv contributions are expected to be small , we ignore them in our analysis .",
    "however , it is conceivable that the host galaxy and grb afterglow emissions might be of comparable strengths in the 24.0 @xmath29 m band ( e.g. , zheng et al . 2006 ; martin et al . 2007 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the host galaxy contribution at 24.0 @xmath29 m can not be empirically determined with just a single epoch of ir observations .",
    "we therefore consider two bracketing scenarios : models a and b. in model a , the measured 24.0 @xmath29 m flux is assumed to be entirely from the grb afterglow . in model b ,",
    "we reduce the 24.0 @xmath29 m flux measurement by a factor of 2 when constructing a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at @xmath33 days post - burst ( see  [ sect : results ] ) .",
    "we further assume that dust extinction by the host galaxy in the ir and x - ray is negligible .",
    "we show later ( in  [ subsect : dustgas ] ) that the derived visual extinction is @xmath34 , which implies , for example , that dust extinction in the 3.6 @xmath29 m band is negligibly small , since it is @xmath35 of that in the @xmath17 band ( b. schmidt 2008 , private communication )",
    ". however , there may be a gray component to the attenuation ( e.g. , perley et al .",
    "2008 ) , which we do not consider .",
    "due to the lack of optical and uv data taken at the same time as the ir observations , we evaluate the fluxes at @xmath33 days by modeling the light curves according to the standard afterglow model ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ; panaitescu & kumar 2000 ) .",
    "the thorough sampling of the @xmath21 band light curve at late times allows for an interpolation , and not a much more dangerous extrapolation , of the data .",
    "we assume that the optical and uv radiation is powered by the same population of electrons , thus allowing for the temporal evolution of the optical and uv light curves to be the same .",

    "the transition at @xmath43 may be interpreted as a jet break ; its existence at @xmath45 to 0.2 days has been discussed in the literature ( b06 ; liang et al .",

    "the optical / uv fit is largely constrained by the @xmath21 band , for which we have the most data points ( 44 ) .",
    "the reduced chi - square value for the combined optical / uv fit is @xmath48 .",
    "since the excess @xmath49 is evenly distributed at all times and frequencies , we believe this somewhat large value of @xmath50 to be due to either an under - estimation of the data errors or to intrinsic high - frequency fluctuations in the light curve .",
    "this will be appropriately taken into account when computing the uncertainties on the fitted parameters .",

    "these fits are noticeably steeper than the @xmath98 attentuation curve derived by johnson et al .",

    "we note that if we only use the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath29 m flux measurements when fitting a power law function to the sed , then our results are consistent with zero extinction in the @xmath17 and @xmath21 bands .",

    "we caution that the galactic extinction towards grb 050525a is comparable to , and in some cases larger than , our derived intrinsic extinction .",
    "given the possible variations in the galactic extinction curve , it is possible that additional sources of errors are present which we have not considered .",
    "for example , schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) report a galactic @xmath17-band extinction of @xmath99 , but with an error of @xmath100 or @xmath101 .",
    "other sources of uncertainty include the galactic uv bump ( savage et al .",
    "1985 ) and the assumed @xmath102 value for the mw ( cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ; and references therein ) .",
    "we now wish to study the consistency of our results with the mw , smc and lmc extinction laws .",
    "these extinction laws were previously presented in weingartner & draine ( 2001 ) and li & draine ( 2001 ) , but have since been updated in draine ( 2003a , b , c ) .",
    "we first convolve the model extinction laws with the relevant filter responses , which for simplicity are assumed to be heaviside ( i.e. , `` top hat '' ) functions .",
    "the filter widths are taken to be 128 , 75 , 98 , 88 , 70 , 51 and 76 nm for the @xmath21 , @xmath17 , @xmath16 , @xmath15 , @xmath14 ( 260 nm ) , @xmath13 ( 220 nm ) and @xmath12 ( 198 nm ) bands , respectively .",
    "we then fit for the optimal value of the host galaxy hydrogen column density , @xmath103 , that allows the model law ( @xmath104 ) to be matched to the observed curve ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "we next use our power law fits to the extinction curves ( see  [ subsect : extcurve ] ) to derive the value of the visual extinction in the @xmath17 band , @xmath105 , _ in the rest frame of the host galaxy _ : @xmath106 ( model a ) , @xmath107 ( model b ) , @xmath108 ( model c ) and @xmath109 ( model d ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath110 values for models a and b are reported in table [ tab : avnh ] .",
    "we first see that the mw extinction laws , regardless of the @xmath102 value and the assumption of either model a or b , are somewhat disfavored even allowing for different dust - to - gas ratios ; less dust is generally required than expected .",
    "this conclusion is also true for models c and d. we also tabulate the ratio of our derived @xmath110 value to the theoretically expected one for the various extinction laws , a quantity we denote by @xmath111 .",
    "we see that the smc and lmc laws provide good fits to our extinction curve .",
    "based on the derived @xmath111 values , about 10 to 40% more dust is present if we use a smc fit . for the lmc fit , model a requires 10% more dust , while model b needs 20% less dust .",

    "the _ spitzer _ ir observations of grb 050525a allow us to determine the extinction curve in its host galaxy while making less assumptions than in previous studies .",
    "recently , li , li & wei ( 2007 ) applied a similar but rather risky methodology , where they attempted to determine the spectral slope of the unabsorbed continuum by employing extrapolation from the x - ray to the optical range of wavelengths .",
    "lacking the ir information means that their results are subjected to large uncertainties .",
    "in addition , the degeneracy of the x - ray spectral slope with the amount of soft x - ray photo - absorption present makes the computation of @xmath110 extremely challenging . in our treatment",
    ", the x - ray spectral information is used only as a consistency check .",
    "li , li & wei ( 2007 ) claimed that the grb hosts they study have gray extinction curves , but this is not surprising considering their basic assumption regarding the slopes of their seds .",
    "a detailed study of the properties of the host galaxy of grb 050525a is beyond the scope of our paper , but we briefly discuss some implications of our results to such a task . the origin of the 2175   bump is a subject of controversy  draine & li ( 2007 ) suggest that it is due to the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) in the dust population .",
    "however , these molecules have been found to be deficient in low - metallicity , high radiation - density , blue dwarf galaxies , the favored hosts of grbs ( e.g. , hogg et al . 2005 ; engelbracht et al .",
    "if our derived extinction curve can be more closely sampled in frequency , it will allow us to make a more definitive statement regarding the absence / presence of the 2175   bump , which may shed light on the pah hypothesis . in their study of dwarf galaxies , engelbracht et al .",
    "( 2008 ) inferred dust - to - gas ratios that differ by 3 orders of magnitude , preventing a meaningful comparison with our derived @xmath110 values .",
    "d06 analyzed the optical spectrum of grb 050525a at the time of the sn bump and concluded that sn 2005nc is akin to sn 1998bw , an energetic type ic sn ( patat et al .",
    "2001 ) , but dimmed by @xmath118 mag .",
    "if we speculate that sn 2005nc is a type ic event as well , it is interesting to ask if grb 050525a / sn 2005nc erupted in the brightest region of a spiral or irregular galaxy , where conditions are appropriate for star formation , as suggested by kelly , kirshner & pahre ( 2007 ) , and if the inferred dust - to - gas content is consistent with such an environment .",
    "such a determination is relevant to the hypothesis that metal - poor and metal - rich wolf - rayet stars , the proposed progenitors of type ic supernovae , result in long grbs and less energetic core collapse explosions , respectively ( yoon & langer 2005 ; woosley & heger 2006 ) .      the dust extinction curve at late times ( i.e. , during the afterglow phase ) may be indicative of the residual extinction present after the onset of the burst radiation .",
    "the effects of dust sublimation can be dramatic if the absorbing region is small and compact ( e.g. , in a molecular cloud ) , while they are negligible for typical ism densities ( waxman & draine 2000 ) . a direct way to quantify the modification of the dust grain population by",
    "the burst radiation is to measure the optical opacities at very early times , when these changes are occuring .",
    "however , these times are generally too short for the effects to be observable ( perna et al .",
    ".    if the absorbing region is small and compact , then variations in the optical opacities should be accompanied by changes in the effective column density due to the ionization of the gas .",
    "these effects occur on a reasonably long timescale and are detectable ( e.g. , lazzati & perna 2002 , 2003 ; campana et al .",
    "to within the measurement uncertainties , b06 detected no changes in @xmath103 from @xmath119 to 25,000 s ( see their table 6 ) .",
    "to accomodate a situation in which dust is destroyed without an accompanying , significant ionization of the gas requires specially fine - tuned conditions ( perna & lazzati 2002 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that our measured extinction curve is pristine to the host galaxy of grb 050525a and was not modified by the prompt emission of the grb .",
    "our method of deriving the dust extinction curve of a grb host galaxy is comparatively robust , since we have cut down on the number of assumptions made in previous studies .",
    "nevertheless , we regard our work as a `` proof of concept '' study , which allows extinction curves to be derived independently of the known templates .",
    "future work may improve on ours by not only obtaining more ir and optical / uv observations simultaneously ( so as to avoid the fitting procedure described in  [ sect : lightcurves ] ) and earlier in time , but also sampling the sed at more frequencies in between the ir and the x - ray .",
    "such observations should be complemented by studies of the host galaxy emission .",
    "for example , the _ gamma - ray burst optical near - infrared detector ( grond ) _ , a 2.2 m european telescope , is capable of observing grb afterglows simultaneously in 7 wavebands from 400 nm to 2.2 @xmath29 m , and is ideally suited for the type of study we have presented in this paper , provided contemporaneous x - ray measurements can be coordinated .",
    "the presence of the 2175   bump can be inferred regardless of the normalization of the unabsorbed continuum or its power - law slope .",
    "however , these two pieces of information are required to derive the shape of the extinction curve and the @xmath110 values , and therein lies the power of the ir data . besides _ grond _ , near - infrared ( nir ) , ground - based observatories will play a key role in such endeavors .",

    "<S> we construct the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the afterglow at @xmath2 and use it to derive the dust extinction curve of the host galaxy in 7 optical / uv wavebands . by comparing our derived extinction curve to known templates , we see that the galactic or milky way extinction laws are disfavored versus the small and large magellanic cloud ( smc and lmc ) ones , but that we can not rule out the presence of a lmc - like 2175   bump in our extinction curve . the dust - to - gas ratio present within the host galaxy of grb 050525a is similar to that found in the lmc , while about 10 to 40% more dust is required if the smc template is assumed . </S>",
