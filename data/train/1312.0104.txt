    "the spectrum of the conventional atmospheric neutrinos is steeper than the cosmic - ray spectrum due to pion and kaon energy losses in the atmosphere .",
    "the second component originates from the decay of charmed mesons , which have livetimes several orders of magnitude smaller than charged pions and kaons .",

    "consequently , an astrophysical flux with equal neutrino flavor contributions would yield more cascade than track events starting inside of icecube .",
    "if the neutrino interaction happens inside the detector , the cherenkov light yield of particle showers scales nearly linearly with the deposited energy , leading to an energy resolution that is better than in the muon channel . on the other hand",

    "previous cascade searches@xcite have shown that protons are of prime importance .",
    "proton primaries produce lower multiplicities of muons with higher individual energies than heavier primaries . compared to air showers induced by heavier elements , which typically lead to muon bundles reaching the detector ,",
    "proton showers are more likely to generate single high - energy muons .",
    "if such a high - energy muon has a single catastrophic energy loss , then the relative light yield between shower and muon can make the resulting event signature look shower - like .",
    "we use a simplified cosmic - ray composition model in our simulation that nevertheless reflects these qualitative differences between light and heavy elements .",
    "this two - component model considers only the two extrema of cosmic - ray composition and comprises two broken power laws , one for the proton and one for the iron spectrum , respectively ( see@xcite and fig .",

    "the statistics drop rather quickly and these low energetic events are underrepresented in the event sample . however , the risk of underestimating the background is low , since the fraction of air showers with a primary energy below @xmath72 which exhibit bremsstrahlung losses of @xmath1 ( @xmath73 ) is only @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) ( see fig .

    "cherenkov light , emitted by charged particles , traverses the optically inhomogeneous detector material and is then sampled by the three - dimensional icecube array with nanosecond precision . hence , the light s arrival times and amplitudes are the sole available information on any particle interaction in the detector .",
    "previous analyses relied on reconstruction algorithms that used only parts of this information , i.e. by considering only the integrated amplitude of all light reaching a dom or by using only the arrival time of the first photon . a new algorithm ` credo ` was developed .",
    "by using the waveform information ` credo ` is able to reconstruct not only the interaction vertex and the deposited energy but also the direction of the incident neutrino .",
    "` credo ` is the first icecube cascade reconstruction algorithm which is able to estimate the direction of the neutrino .",
    "the measurement process is described with a probabilistic model and a maximum likelihood estimator allows information on the vertex of the neutrino interaction , the neutrino direction and the deposited energy to be inferred .",
    "` credo ` considers the information on an event in the form of time intervals @xmath76 in which a dom at position @xmath77 recorded a given amount of charge @xmath78 .",
    "formally , the event is then described with the set @xmath79 , where the index @xmath80 runs over all such intervals .",
    "it should be noted , that this set also contains time intervals in which no charge has been recorded , since these time intervals also carry constraining information .",
    "the particle showers are modeled as point - like cherenkov emitters , in the same way as they are described in simulation .",
    "a particle shower is then fully specified by @xmath81 parameters @xmath82 : the time and position of the vertex , two angles for the direction of the neutrino and the deposited energy .",
    "the scattering and absorption of light in the antarctic ice are depth dependent .",
    "the ` photonics ` package@xcite is used to calculate the light propagation in the ice and to create tables with light arrival times and amplitudes as a function of the depth and the relative position between particle shower and dom . in order to avoid binning effects the table values",
    "are interpolated by multidimensional spline fits@xcite prior to being used in the reconstruction .",
    "the ` photonics ` tables are used to calculate for each time interval @xmath80 an estimate of the mean expected charge @xmath83  . in this sum @xmath84",
    "is the contribution due to the cascade @xmath85 and @xmath86 is a continuous noise contribution . in each time interval",
    "a counting experiment is performed , and the probability of a given measurement @xmath87 under the condition @xmath85 can be calculated : @xmath88 from this probability one can construct a maximum likelihood estimator , yielding the parameters @xmath89 best supported by the measurement : @xmath90    the search for the global maximum in the @xmath81-dimensional likelihood space is performed by minimizing the negative logarithm of the likelihood using the simplex minimizer in the minuit software package@xcite . in order to avoid local minima the search is done iteratively , where in each step the minimizer starts at a different position in the parameter space .",
    "the iterative minimization and the many necessary table lookups for each time interval form a time - consuming procedure that can not be applied to all events . however , this reconstruction finds the position of the particle shower with a resolution of @xmath91 horizontally and , due to the smaller dom spacing , @xmath92 vertically .",
    "the energy resolution for an astrophysical neutrino spectrum is about @xmath93 and the angular resolution is about @xmath94 .",
    "other variants of the likelihood reconstruction described here have been developed and been used in more recent analyses . by incorporating improvements in the understanding of the detector response and a better modeling of the ice they provide better resolutions and determine icecube s performance on cascades today@xcite .",
    "a small number of neutrino generated showers need to be isolated from a large background of atmospheric muons .",
    "this is achieved by finding and applying a set of conditions on the reconstructed event properties that neutrino induced showers fulfill , but atmospheric muons do not . in practice",
    "this selection is implemented as a multi - step process .",
    "the first steps in the process are aimed at conservatively reducing the background , allowing the use of computationally intensive reconstruction algorithms , that can be applied to a reduced set of events only .",
    "each step in the event selection process is referred to as a `` level '' .",
    "level @xmath30 , the trigger condition , was described in section [ section : theicecubedetector ] .",
    "level @xmath95 , the online filter applied at south pole , and subsequent levels are outlined in this section .",
    "the section will first introduce the classification schemes and cut variables used for separation of the signal from the background and then turn to a description of the individual samples .",
    "the background rejection criteria used in neutrino cascade searches can be classified conceptually as belonging in the following four categories .    * reconstructed particle parameters : * four different likelihood reconstruction routines are used in the searches described here .",
    "the routines differ in runtime , precision , initial assumptions and in the number of neutrino parameters that they infer from the event .",
    "three of the reconstruction routines return parameters with the hypothesis that the event is a particle - shower .",
    "the fourth routine used assumes the event contains a muon track .    at earlier cut levels",
    "the ` cscd_llh ` likelihood reconstruction@xcite is used .",
    "it does nt account for the optical inhomogeneities of the ice but provides a quick estimate for the vertex and a quality parameter @xmath96 that describes how well the event fits to the cascade hypothesis .    using the vertex estimate from ` cscd_llh ` another estimate for the deposited energy , @xmath97 , is provided by the ` atmcscdenergyreco ` algorithm@xcite .",
    "it is quick to compute and considers the optical inhomogeneities of the ice .    at later levels the ` credo ` algorithm",
    "described in section [ section : reconstructionofparticleshowers ] provides the best estimates for the reconstructed vertex @xmath98 , deposited energy @xmath99 and zenith angle @xmath100 .",
    "the superscript @xmath101 distinguishes , where necessary , applications of the ` credo ` algorithm with differing numbers of iterations .",
    "all events are also reconstructed with another likelihood reconstruction@xcite which assumes that the event contains a muon track .",
    "this routine gives a zenith angle estimate @xmath102 and provides a quality of fit parameter @xmath103 for the track hypothesis .",
    "the zenith angle estimator correctly identifies much of the muon background as downgoing .",
    "particle showers are preferentially interpreted as either horizontally or diagonally passing tracks which allows for some signal - background separation .",
    "* containment & vetoing : * a particularly problematic background are muon events which pass close to the edges of the detector producing a light distribution which is similar to that produced by cascades . to counter this background",
    "various containment conditions are placed on the position of the reconstructed vertex , the first - hit dom and the dom with the highest collected charge .",
    "events are excluded if the first hit dom or the dom with the highest collected charge is located in the outermost vertical layer ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : ic40detector ] ) .",
    "events are also vetoed if the depth of the first hit dom @xmath104 falls in the top or bottom @xmath105 of the detector .",
    "the reconstructed vertex @xmath106 is required to lie inside the instrumented volume and not in the top or bottom @xmath105 of the detector .",
    "the analyses presented in this paper found different containment conditions on the @xmath107-position of the vertex to be optimal , when combined with their particular selection cuts , for suppressing background while maintaining signal efficiency .",
    "the two alternative containment conditions are illustrated by the solid and dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ figure : ic40detector ] .    * topological characteristics : * the hit patterns of particle showers in icecube are approximately spherical while the muon - track hit patterns are more elongated .",
    "a number of different quantities can be calculated to characterize the different topology of cascade and muon events and used to preferentially select cascades .",
    "for example , a quantity analogous to the tensor of inertia of a rigid body , is calculated for each event .",
    "the collected charge on each dom takes the role of the rigid body s mass distribution .",
    "the ratio of the smallest eigenvalue to the sum of all of the eigenvalues , @xmath108 , tends to @xmath109 for spherical events while muon tracks typically have smaller eigenvalue ratios@xcite .",
    "another way to select spherical events is to construct a spherical volume surrounding the reconstructed event vertex @xmath106 and consider the proportion of hit doms , versus the total number of doms , in this sphere .",
    "the radius of the sphere considered is chosen to scale with the average distance between reconstructed vertex @xmath106 and position of the hit doms  a robust estimate for the overall size of the hit pattern .",
    "the fill - ratio @xmath110 denotes the fraction of doms , falling within the sphere , on which light is recorded@xcite .",
    "hence , fill - ratios close to @xmath111 are obtained for spherical hit patterns , while muon events yield lower values .",
    "the fill - ratio is especially efficient to suppress coincident muon events  two or more muons from different air showers that cross the icecube detector within microseconds of each other .",
    "a second quantity , the difference @xmath112 of two fill - ratios with different radii , is also used .",
    "this quantity provides further separation power due to the fill - ratio s dependency on the chosen radius being slightly different for the differently shaped hit patterns of cascades and tracks .",
    "* time evolution and charge distribution : * below @xmath64 energies the cherenkov light of particle showers originates within a few meters of the interaction vertex and then propagates through the detector with the speed of light in ice @xmath113 . in contrast , muon tracks traverse the detector with velocities close to the speed of light in vacuum @xmath114 and emit cherenkov photons continuously along their track .",
    "several approaches exploit this difference to separate cascade and track events .",
    "a simple approach , that can be applied before the event vertex has been reconstructed , is the ` linefit ` algorithm .",
    "the hit pattern is fitted with a straight line propagating with velocity @xmath115@xcite .",
    "relativistic muons often yield ` linefit ` velocities close to @xmath114 whereas lower velocities are obtained if the fit is applied to cascades .",
    "if the interaction time and vertex are well reconstructed then causality can be used to provide a strong constraint on whether an event is a neutrino - induced particle shower event . for each dom",
    ", light is expected to arrive at the earliest after the time necessary to cover the distance between the dom and the vertex , at velocity @xmath113 .",
    "while delayed photon arrivals are common due to light scattering in the ice , much earlier arrival times indicate a problem with the cascade hypothesis .",
    "the difference between the expected ( @xmath116 ) and observed ( @xmath117 ) arrival time is calculated for all doms and @xmath118 is defined as the smallest such delay time @xmath119 .",
    "events with large negative values of @xmath118 are removed .",
    "another approach is to sort the doms by the time they recorded light and then consider the unit vector from one hit dom to a subsequent hit dom as an individual dipole moment .",
    "the global dipole moment @xmath120 is obtained by averaging over all individual dipole moments .",
    "larger moments are expected from tracks and smaller moments from cascades@xcite .    yet another way to emphasize",
    "the different hit pattern evolution of tracks and cascades is to divide the event into two parts based on the times of the hit doms .",
    "this splits tracks into two disjunct segments and cascades into two mostly concentric shells .",
    "the ` cscd_llh ` algorithm is used to obtain , for each half , the vertices @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "large radial and vertical distances @xmath123 and @xmath124 between the vertices as well as large differences in the reconstructed time @xmath125 are then indicative of tracks .",
    "another feature of cascade events , which is also related to the fact that the particle showers are only a few meters in length , is that most of the light is recorded close to the vertex and hence early in the event .",
    "in contrast , since muons emit light continuously along their track it is more likely to see later contributions to the total charge .",
    "the variable @xmath126 denotes the fraction of the event length in which the total collected charge rises from @xmath127 to @xmath10 .",
    "greater @xmath126 values indicate a longer time interval for the second half of the event s total charge to be collected and are more likely to occur for muon events .",
    "some discrimination power comes from doms where just enough light arrives to trigger the readout and hence only a single pulse is reconstructed from the waveform . a combination of light yield , scattering in the ice and the geometric shape of the hit pattern results in a slightly higher number of these doms for muons .",
    "the ratio @xmath128 of doms with only one reconstructed pulse over the total number of hit doms tends to smaller values for cascades .",
    "finally , a useful variable is the ratio of the charge collected in the dom with the highest charge , compared to the total recorded charge @xmath129 .",
    "low energetic muons passing very close to one dom can yield a high charge concentration in this dom compared to others .",
    "these events can resemble cascade - like hit patterns and are prone to be overestimated in energy .",
    "hence , requiring a low ratio @xmath129 is useful to reject this class of background events .",
    "three event selections , named slowromancap1@a , slowromancap1@b and slowromancap2@ , were developed to search for neutrinos in the icecube-@xmath0 dataset .",
    "the multiple event selections allowed sensitivity to both high - energy astrophysical and low - energy atmospheric neutrinos as well as providing a collaboration internal cross - check .",
    "the different event selections rely on similar selection methods that are differently combined for the individual goals of the analyses .",
    "the event selections share the first three filter levels but differ at later filter steps , since analysis slowromancap1@a aimed at measuring atmospheric neutrinos whereas analyses slowromancap1@b and",
    "slowromancap2@ were optimized towards an astrophysical neutrino flux . in order to avoid experimenter s bias a blind analysis",
    "was performed .",

    "a simple cut - and - count experiment was done on the remaining @xmath10 .",
    "analyses slowromancap1@a and slowromancap1@b were developed in parallel to analysis slowromancap2@ , but only unblinded afterwards .",
    "the crucial difference is that they utilized a significantly improved background simulation described in section [ section : simulation ] , resulting in the choice of tighter cuts and a purer neutrino sample .",
    "consequently here the focus is put on samples slowromancap1@a and slowromancap1@b .",
    "an overview of the cuts performed to obtain the three samples is given in table  [ table : cutcomparison ] .",
    "a comparison of the energy thresholds and event rates is given in table  [ table : eikeunblindingresults ] .",
    "sizable systematic uncertainties must be considered in interpreting the result .",
    "therefore for samples slowromancap1@a and slowromancap1@b a bayesian approach was chosen ( described in appendix [ section : bayesianmethod ] ) and the result is reported in form of the posterior probability for the number of non - background events .",
    "triggered events are filtered online at the south pole to reduce the data volume to the bandwidth available for data transfer from the pole via satellite .",
    "the online filter , or level @xmath95 is a filter on easy - to - compute variables that retains the majority of the neutrino signal while removing a large fraction of the background .",
    "it requires the ` linefit ` velocity to be @xmath131 and the tensor - of - inertia eigenvalue ratio to be @xmath132 .",

    "the distributions show some disagreement between data and simulation .",
    "further steps in the event selection will reduce this disagreement , mostly by removing events that are too low in energy or that are not contained in the instrumented volume .",
    "the pole filter reduced the data rate by two orders of magnitude to approximately @xmath133 .    due to the energy threshold of about @xmath134 and the steeply falling energy spectrum ,",
    "the energy distribution of background events , passing level 2 is strongly peaked at lower energies . as the majority of the events",
    "are still atmospheric muons most of the events are reconstructed as downgoing tracks ( see fig .  [",
    "figure : level3_2d_zenith_energy ] ) .",
    "consequently , the level @xmath135 cuts concentrate on reducing the background at low energies .",
    "all events with a reconstructed energy @xmath136 are kept , whereas lower energetic events are subject to two more cuts .",
    "first , when reconstructed under a muon track hypothesis , events reconstructed as downgoing with zenith angles @xmath137 are rejected .",
    "secondly , those events are removed , where a ` cscd_llh ` likelihood value of @xmath138 indicates a poorly fitted event . after application of the level @xmath135 filter the data rate is reduced by another order of magnitude to approximately @xmath139 , while contained astrophysical ( atmospheric ) neutrinos were kept with an efficiency of @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) .      after level @xmath135 ,",
    "the analyses diverge .",
    "event selection slowromancap1@a aims at the observation of atmospheric neutrinos with energies of a few @xmath18 .",
    "previous cuts aimed to provide an optimal efficiency for cascades regardless of their energy and position inside the detector . as a consequence at level @xmath135 a significant number of events , that are very low in energy or happening at the border of the instrumented volume , remain in the sample . for these events no reliable separation between signal and background could be found .",
    "therefore , a set of geometric conditions has been defined to remove such events : it is required that the first hit dom is neither on the outer layer of icecube-@xmath0 ( red squares in fig .",
    "[ figure : ic40detector ] ) nor in the top or bottom @xmath142 of the detector . also doms on at least five different strings must have recorded light .",
    "this cut reduces the data rate to @xmath143 , while contained astrophysical ( atmospheric ) neutrinos are kept with an efficiency of @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "after these cuts , at the so - called level @xmath146 , additional reconstructions but no cuts were performed . in particular",
    "the remaining sample was small enough to perform the ` credo ` likelihood reconstruction described in section [ section : reconstructionofparticleshowers ] with @xmath147 iterations .",
    "muon background still dominates over atmospheric neutrino - induced showers by three orders of magnitude at selection level @xmath146 .",
    "therefore , the vertex and energy estimates are used to apply another series of event selection conditions .    at level @xmath148 ,",
    "the energy threshold is set to @xmath149 . in order to remove events where low energetic muons pass very close to a dom and where their energy is likely to be overestimated ,",
    "a cut on @xmath150 is applied .",
    "furthermore , the containment requirement is enforced : the reconstructed vertex must lie inside the blue solid boundary shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : ic40detector ] , its @xmath151-coordinate must be inside the instrumented depth interval and also the dom with the highest recorded charge in the event may not be on the outer layer . a constraint on the minimum delay time @xmath152 is used to remove events where causality rules out the cascade hypothesis .",
    "together with requiring a fill - ratio @xmath153 , this set of cuts reduces the data rate by two orders of magnitude down to @xmath154 , while retaining efficiencies for contained astrophysical and atmospheric neutrinos of @xmath155 and @xmath156 , respectively .",
    "overall agreement of event properties between simulation and experimental data is good ( see fig .  [",

    "this is a necessary precondition for the final event selection step , which uses a multivariate algorithm to distinguish signal and background events .",
    "the final step of the event selection is to remove the remaining background and obtain a sample dominated by neutrinos . for this purpose event properties that still provide separation power",
    "are used as input to a multivariate algorithm to obtain a single quality parameter for each event .",
    "the tmva package@xcite is used to train a boosted decision tree ( bdt ) . in total @xmath157 variables",
    "are combined into one final event quality variable @xmath158 .",
    "these are the ` cscd_llh ` algorithm s quality parameter @xmath96 , the vertical and radial distances @xmath159 of the time - split reconstructions , the fraction of doms with only one reconstructed pulse @xmath128 and the fraction of the event duration needed to accumulate the second half of the total charge @xmath126 .",
    "the two zenith angle estimators @xmath160 and @xmath102 enter the bdt as well as the dipole moment @xmath120 and the fill - ratio difference for two radii @xmath112 . finally , the eigenvalue ratio @xmath161 and the minimum delay time @xmath162 are used , too .",

    "closer inspection reveals that these events are muons with prominent bremsstrahlung cascades and little to no hint of the muon track .",
    "the events resemble neutrino - induced particle showers rather well .",
    "the geometry of icecube-@xmath0 with one dimension being much shorter than the others is obviously vulnerable to this class of background events . in the energy range below @xmath14 , with the given detector and the aforementioned background rejection methods , including their combination within a multivariate classifier , these events turn out to be irreducible background .",
    "this limits the possible background suppression for sample slowromancap1@a .",
    "atmospheric neutrino signal and muon background are similarly distributed at @xmath158 scores @xmath163 , so cutting at a higher value removes the atmospheric neutrino signal as much as the atmospheric muon background . as a consequence",
    "a @xmath158 value of @xmath164 is the optimal separation point between background and signal that maximizes the detection potential@xcite for an atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "however , a rather large number of @xmath165 events is expected in sample slowromancap1@a from which @xmath3 are expected to be atmospheric muons and @xmath4 conventional and prompt neutrinos .",

    "the reconstructed energy distribution is extrapolated from the low - energy region , where simulated events are still available , to higher energies .    up",
    "to @xmath64 energies , the energy spectrum of the brightest bremsstrahlung cascades along simulated muon tracks can be described by a power - law @xmath171 . for muon events , which pass the event selection , the corresponding energy spectrum is not necessarily the same , because of the energy - dependent performance of the cuts .",
    "e.g. muon events with bright bremsstrahlungs cascades are suppressed with increasing energy , since the muon becomes more likely to be detected in the veto region . on the other hand ,",
    "the selection efficiency for particle showers rises with increasing deposited energy .",
    "hence , the model used to extrapolate the muon background into the signal region is the product of two functions : the selection efficiency for particle showers as a function of deposited energy ( derived from simulation ) and a power - law with the index and normalization as free parameters .",
    "this model provides a reasonable fit to the energy distribution of background muons below the energy threshold ( see fig .  [",
