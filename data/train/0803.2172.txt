    "several important models of quasicrystals are provided by ( decorations of ) nonperiodic substitution tilings . in this paper , only tilings of the plane are considered . in larger dimensions",
    "some aspects become rather complicated , in particular , generalisations of theorem [ unifdistr ] . a substitution ( or tile - substitution , but we stick to the shorter term here ) is just a rule how to enlarge and dissect a collection of tiles @xmath0 into copies of @xmath1 , as indicated in figure [ imbal ] ( left ) or figure [ substbsp ] . iterating this rule yields tilings of larger and larger portions of the plane . however , the precise description of a substitution tiling in @xmath2 is usually given as follows .",
    "let @xmath3 be compact subsets of @xmath2 , such that each @xmath4 equals the closure of its interior .",
    "these are the _",
    "prototiles _ , the pieces our tiling is built of .",
    "we refer to sets which are congruent to some prototile simply as _",
    "tiles_. ( sometimes two prototiles are allowed to be congruent , compare figure [ imbal ] . then we equip each one of them with an additional attribute ( colour , decoration ) to distinct them .",
    "whenever we speak of congruent tiles in the sequel , this means congruent with respect to possible decorations. ) a _ tiling _ ( with prototiles @xmath1 ) is a collection of tiles ( each one congruent to some @xmath4 ) which covers @xmath2 such that every @xmath5 is contained in the interior of at most one tile .",
    "note , that each such tiling @xmath6 can be described by placements of the prototiles : @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes a rotation through @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are translation vectors .",
    "for later purposes , we define the _ orientation _ @xmath11 of a tile : if @xmath12 , @xmath13 , then @xmath14",
    ".    now , let @xmath15 and @xmath16 be a map which maps each prototile @xmath4 to a non - overlapping collection of tiles , each one congruent to some prototile @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , we require the substitution @xmath16 to be _ selfsimilar _ in the sequel .",
    "that is , @xmath17 for @xmath18 . by setting @xmath19 ,",
    "the substitution @xmath16 extends naturally to any tile congruent to some prototile . in a similar way , by @xmath20",
    ", the substitution @xmath16 extends to all ( finite or infinite ) collections of tiles .",
    "in particular , one can iterate @xmath16 on the prototiles to obtain the @xmath21-th order _ supertiles _ @xmath22 .",
    "[ defsubst ] let @xmath16 be a tile - substitution with prototiles @xmath1 .",
    "a tiling @xmath6 is called _ substitution tiling _ ( with substitution @xmath16 ) if for each finite subset @xmath23 there are @xmath24 such that a copy of @xmath25 is contained in some supertile @xmath26 .",
    "the family of all substitution tilings with substitution @xmath16 is denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "the matrix @xmath28 with @xmath29 is called _",
    "substitution matrix_. a substitution is _ primitive _ , if there is @xmath30 such that @xmath31 is strictly positive .    here",
    ", @xmath32 denotes the cardinality of the set @xmath33 .",
    "this definition of a substitution tiling fits well into several contexts , for instance , to the _ hull _ of a tiling , see section [ dynsys ] .",
    "most of the well - known substitution tilings have the property that all prototiles occur in only finitely many orientations .",
    "for instance , the penrose dart and kite tiling has just two prototiles , a convex and a non - convex quadrangle .",
    "each one occurs in one of 10 different orientations throughout the tiling .",
    "there are also substitution tilings where the tiles occur in infinitely many orientations .",
    "the most prominent examples are certainly the pinwheel tilings @xcite .",
    "but there are many other examples , compare @xcite , @xcite .",
    "two examples are shown in figure [ substbsp ] .",
    "it was known for the pinwheel tiling that there are not only infinitely many orientations of the tiles , but that they are furthermore equidistributed @xcite , @xcite .",
    "intuitively , this means that each orientation occurs with the same frequency throughout the tiling . in order to make this precise ,",
    "we need the following definition . recall that a sequence @xmath34 is _ equidistributed _ in @xmath35 , if for all @xmath36 holds : @xmath37}(a_j )   = \\frac{x - y}{2 \\pi}.\\ ] ] since the above sum is not absolutely convergent , it depends strongly on the ordering of the sequence .",
    "thus we need to order the tiles in the tiling in some not - too - weird way .",
    "this is done in the following definition .",
    "let @xmath38 be a primitive substitution tiling .",
    "let the numbering be such that the sequence @xmath39 satisfies the following property : for all @xmath40 , there is some @xmath41 such that the patch @xmath42 is congruent to some supertile @xmath22 for some prototile @xmath4 , @xmath30 .",
    "the tiling @xmath43 has _ statistical circular symmetry _ , if , for all @xmath44 , one has : @xmath45}(\\phi(t_j ) )   = \\frac{x - y}{2 \\pi}.\\ ] ]",
    "the ordering in the definition is compatible with other natural notions , for instance , ordering the tiles with respect to their distance to the origin .",
    "the following result was obtained in @xcite .",
    "only while preparing the present text , the author realized that a similar result already appeared in @xcite ; see also the comments in section [ dynsys ] .",
    "[ unifdistr ] let @xmath6 be a primitive substitution tiling in @xmath2 , where copies of some prototile occur in infinitely many orientations .",
    "then @xmath6 is of statistical circular symmetry .    in the next section this theorem",
    "is used to show that any such tiling has circular diffraction spectrum .",
    "now we show an analogue of the theorem above for tilings with tiles in finitely many orientations .",
    "one can ask whether there are substitution tilings where tiles occur more frequent in one direction than the other .",
    "this is possible , see figure [ imbal ] for an example .",
    "but this is achieved by substituting the horizontal rectangle differently from the vertical rectangle .",
    "in fact we have two prototiles in this example , each one occurring in one direction only .",
    "this is illustrated in the right part of figure [ imbal ] by assigning different decorations to the tiles .",
    "the following theorem states that each prototile @xmath4 occurs in each of its orientations with the same frequency in a primitive substitution tiling . in order to make this precise ,",
    "let @xmath46 denote the frequency of tiles @xmath47 in a tiling @xmath6 .",
    "that is , @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the closed ball of radius @xmath50 around the origin .",
    "for primitive substitution tilings , this frequency exists and is independent of the choice of the origin .",
    "this can be seen as follows : up to now , we identified types of tiles with respect to congruence congruence classes . in a tiling with",
    "finitely many orientations , one can as well identify types of tiles with respect to translation classes .",
    "usually , this results in a larger number of prototiles ( e.g. , the penrose dart and kite tilings have two prototiles up to congruence , but 20 prototiles up to translation ) .",
    "the frequency of each prototile in a primitive substitution tiling can be obtained from the substitution matrix @xmath28 .",
    "this result is folklore , see for instance @xcite , @xcite : the normed perron - frobenius eigenvector of @xmath28 contains the relative frequencies of the prototiles . in particular , in all tilings in @xmath27 ,",
    "these frequencies are the same . therefore , for any given primitive substitution",
    ", we can drop the @xmath6 in the definition of the frequency in this case and write just @xmath51 .",
    "[ finor ] let @xmath16 be a primitive substitution with prototiles @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath53 , @xmath54 then @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath53 , then the prototiles occur in finitely many orientations only , by primitivity of the substitution and theorem [ unifdistr ] .",
    "therefore we obtain finitely many prototiles with respect to translations : @xmath56 .",
    "consider a tiling @xmath57 . by the remarks preceding the theorem ,",
    "@xmath58 is well defined , and its value is the same in the tiling @xmath6 and in the tiling @xmath59 .",
    "and trivially , @xmath60 in @xmath6 equals @xmath61 in @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , @xmath63 , and the claim follows .",
    "there is a wealth of literature devoted to the mathematical description of the diffraction spectrum of nonperiodic structures , see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , or the introductory text @xcite and references therein .",
    "usually one starts with a discrete point set @xmath64 rather than a tiling . in the present context of tilings ,",
    "this can be achieved by decorating each prototile with one or more points ( atomic decorations ) .",
    "let @xmath65 be such a point set , obtained from a tiling .",
    "the diffraction spectrum of @xmath65 is the fourier transform of the autocorrelation of @xmath65 .",
    "the autocorrelation ( also called patterson function ) of @xmath65 is @xmath66 if this limit exists . here and in the following we are working in the framework of tempered distributions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus the limit above is to be understood as a vague limit .",
    "if the limit does not exist , there is a subsequence converging to an autocorrelation which is known to be translation bounded ( since we started with a translation bounded measure @xmath67 ) and positive definite . thus @xmath68 can be regarded as a translation bounded positive definite measure .",
    "now , the fourier transform @xmath69 of @xmath68 is the _ diffraction measure _ , and its support is the diffraction spectrum of @xmath65 .",
    "we are interested in the nature of @xmath69 . by lebesgue",
    "s decomposition theorem , @xmath69 has a unique decomposition @xmath70 with respect to the lebesgue measure in @xmath2 .",
    "the pure point part @xmath71 is a countable sum of dirac measures .",
    "the absolutely continuous part @xmath72 is a measure with locally integrable density function supported on a set of positive lebesgue measure .",
    "the singular continuous @xmath73 part assigns zero to all finite sets , but is supported on a set with lebesgue measure zero .",
    "the ( idealized ) diffraction spectrum of a quasicrystal is pure point , the singular parts vanish completely .",
    "the following results show that substitution tilings with statistical circular symmetry have a diffraction measure which is of ( perfect ) circular symmetry .",
    "consequently , the pure point part of the diffraction is trivial .",
    "[ thmautocor ] let @xmath74 be a primitive substitution tiling of statistical circular symmetry , with prototiles @xmath3 .",
    "choose control points @xmath75 , and define @xmath76 .",
    "then the autocorrelation @xmath77 of @xmath65 is circular symmetric .",
    "the subtlety of this theorem is that the autocorrelation is not of statistical circular symmetry only ( this is easy to see ) but of perfect circular symmetry .",
    "the rotated measure @xmath78 is defined by @xmath79 for all measurable sets @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath80 is of circular symmetry if @xmath81 for all @xmath82 .",
    "since @xmath6 is of statistical circular symmetry , @xmath6 contains tiles @xmath83 congruent to some prototile @xmath4 for ( countably ) infinitely many distinct angles @xmath84 . by equidistribution ,",
    "the frequency of tiles in one certain orientation is 0 .",
    "but , again by the equidistribution of @xmath85 , the frequency of tiles in a certain range of orientations  say , @xmath86  equals the frequency of tiles in orientations @xmath87 for all @xmath88 .",
    "the same is obviously true for supertiles in @xmath6 .",
    "the autocorrelation is defined via difference vectors @xmath89 .",
    "we deduce the circular symmetry of the autocorrelation by assigning these vectors @xmath89 to supertiles in @xmath6 .",
    "each such vector arises from a constellation of two tiles ( usually not adjacent ) .",
    "consider only vectors @xmath89 of fixed a length @xmath90 .",
    "let @xmath30 .",
    "then either @xmath91 and @xmath92 are contained in the same @xmath21-th order supertile , or in two different @xmath21-th order supertiles . with growing @xmath21",
    ", the ratio of the latter kind to the former kind tends to zero .",
    "thus it suffices to regard the former kind only .",
    "each one arises from a @xmath21-th order supertile , these are equidistributed , hence equidistribution of orientations of difference vectors @xmath89 of radius @xmath50 follows . in other words ,",
    "the frequency of difference vectors @xmath89 of length @xmath50 with orientation @xmath93 equals the frequency of difference vectors of length @xmath50 in orientations @xmath87 for all @xmath88 .",
    "it follows that @xmath94 for all rotations @xmath82 .",
    "now we can apply the following standard result , which can be found for instance in @xcite .",
    "[ taurlemma ] let @xmath82 be an orthogonal map , @xmath80 a measure , and let the measure @xmath78 be given by @xmath95",
    ". then @xmath96 .",
    "since @xmath97 , with @xmath65 as in [ thmautocor ] , it follows @xmath98 for all rotations @xmath82 .",
    "altogether we have obtained the following result .",
    "let @xmath65 be as in theorem [ thmautocor ] arising from a tiling with statistical circular symmetry .",
    "then the diffraction of @xmath65 is circular symmetric . @xmath99    an immediate consequence is that the pure point part of the diffraction spectrum of a tiling with statistical circular symmetry is at most one peak at the origin .",
    "a simple argument shows that this peak always exists , compare @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these results are relevant for physics because such tilings can serve as a simple model for powder diffraction @xcite .",
    "an important tool in investigating properties of nonperiodic tilings is the fact that such a tiling gives rise to a dynamical system , compare @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite . from the properties of the dynamical system one can deduce properties of the tiling . for brevity , we describe the metrical dynamical system corresponding to @xcite . in the context of this paper ,",
    "the topology defined by this metric is the same as the more general local rubber topology in @xcite , as well as the topology in @xcite and the local topology in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath100 be the following metric , measuring whether two tilings are close to each other .",
    "@xmath101 if @xmath102 is small , then @xmath6 and @xmath103 agree on a large ball around the origin , after a small rotation followed by a small translation .",
    "now , the _ hull _ @xmath104 of the tiling @xmath6 is the closure of @xmath105 with respect to @xmath100 .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the hull of a primitive substitution tiling with substitution @xmath16 is the family @xmath27 of all substitution tilings ( compare def .  [ defsubst ] ) .",
    "therefore , we denote the hull of @xmath6 by @xmath27 , if it is clear which substitution @xmath16 belongs to @xmath6 .",
    "a substitution @xmath16 gives rise to a dynamical system @xmath106 , where either @xmath107 ( all translations in the plane ) , or @xmath108 ( all direct euclidean motions , i.e. , all maps @xmath109 , @xmath82 a rotation , @xmath110 a translation vector ) .",
    "the study of such dynamical systems yields deep insight into the diffraction properties of the tilings in @xmath27 .",
    "a milestone in the mathematical diffraction theory is the result that the diffraction spectrum is pure point if and only if the dynamical spectrum is pure point @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "other important results are collected in the following theorem .",
    "it summarises contributions of several people to the subject over the last two decades . for brevity ,",
    "it is formulated for the special case of plane tilings only .",
    "let @xmath16 be a primitive substitution .    1 .",

    "( each @xmath27 as above contains a self - affine tiling , and by primitivity , all tilings in @xmath27 have the same cluster frequencies . )",
    "however , for tilings with statistical circular symmetry , these frequencies are zero . but see @xcite for a similar uniformity result in this case .",
