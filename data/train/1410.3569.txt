    "nature of the dark matter ( dm ) in the universe is one of the longstanding problems in both particle physics and cosmology .",
    "the dm abundance observed today is  @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the reduced hubble constant .",
    "much attention has been paid to weakly - interacting massive particles ( wimps ) as the candidates for the dm since it is the natural consequence of physics at the tev scale where the next physics threshold is expected to show up based on the naturalness argument .    among the various dm scenarios ,",
    "one of the simplest ones is that the dm particles are coupled to the standard model ( sm ) particles only through @xmath9 gauge interactions .",

    ", it is known that the dm particle mass would be completely fixed if the thermal relic explains the dm abundance in eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) . for example , the mass of a fermionic dm that belongs to the su(2)@xmath1 doublet ( triplet ) with hypercharge @xmath10 should be about 1 ( 3 ) tev .",
    "those dark matter particles are realized in the supersymmetric ( susy ) standard model as higgsino ( wino ) . in the non - thermal relic scenarios , on the other hand",
    ", the dm relic abundance could be satisfied as a result of a non - thermal production of the dm from late decay of some heavy particles such as gravitinos in susy models .",
    "in such a case , the dm particles do not necessarily have the multi - tev scale mass , and they could be as light as @xmath0 gev .",
    "if so , in addition to the standard dm searches , we may find dm signals indirectly in the collider or low energy experiments , even if they are not directly found .    in this letter , we study the electroweak - interacting fermionic dm particles with the mass of @xmath0 gev , and discuss their phenomenological consequences in a bottom - up approach .",
    "the interactions between the su(2)@xmath1 isospin multiplets and the higgs boson are described by dimension - five operators .",
    "such effective interactions violate cp symmetry generically , and thus cp - violating observables such as the electric dipole moments ( edms ) of electron , neutron and atoms are predicted .",
    "in addition , the effective interactions induce the spin - independent ( si ) dm - nucleon elastic - scattering cross section and the higgs boson decay to diphoton . in this paper",
    "we evaluate the electron edm , the si dm - nucleon cross section and the higgs signal strength for the higgs boson decay to diphoton mode , and confront them with current experimental data .",
    "future prospects are also discussed .",
    "in this section , we will describe the effective couplings of the fermionic dm particles with the higgs boson .",
    "now we assume that the dm particle @xmath11 is a fermion with the su(2)@xmath12u(1)@xmath13 gauge charges .",
    "the effective higgs couplings depend on whether @xmath11 has the u(1)@xmath13 interaction .",

    "the dm particle @xmath11 has the majorana mass term while other particles with non - zero electric charges @xmath24 have dirac ones .",
    "we take @xmath25 real positive in the following .",
    "the dm particle does not have renormalizable interactions with the su(2)@xmath1 doublet higgs boson @xmath26 , since it is assumed to be a fermion .",
    "now we take the hypercharge for the higgs boson @xmath27 .",
    "the interactions are given with higher - dimensional ones , which are induced though integration of heavy particles .",
    "the dimension - five operators are @xmath28 here , only the isoscalar couplings appear at the dimension five . while bilinears of isospin-@xmath14 multiplets include an su(2)@xmath1 adjoint representation , it is antisymmetric if @xmath14 integer .",
    "those effective interactions are induced , for example , by integration of su(2)@xmath1 @xmath29-multiplet heavy fermions with hypercharge @xmath30 at the tree level . in the wino case ,",
    "the effective interaction with higgs boson is generated by integration of the higgsinos . in this paper",
    ", we do not adopt such concrete uv models and we take a bottom - up approach as mentioned above .",
    "the effective couplings with the higgs boson contribute to the masses for @xmath15 after the higgs field gets the vacuum expectation value @xmath31 as @xmath32 where @xmath33 the masses for @xmath15 are degenerate at the tree level .",
    "however , it is known that the electroweak corrections make their masses different so that @xmath11 is the lightest . the mass difference between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 ,",

    "we take @xmath54 real without loss of generality and assume it positive for simplicity .",
    "the components with larger @xmath55 are lighter if the cp - violating coupling constant @xmath56 is negligible .",
    "thus , the lightest state is @xmath57 , and we have to take @xmath58 so that the lightest state is neutral . on the other hand , if the second term in eq .",

    "thus , the neutral fermion is the lightest only when @xmath67 , unless the tree- and loop - level contributions to the mass of the neutral fermion cancel each others accidentally .",
    "null results of the dm direct detection give a stringent constraint on the vector coupling of the dark matter particles .",
    "thus , the dm particle has to be a majorana fermion in order to forbid the vector current interaction .",
    "now let us consider the case of @xmath58 .",
    "the neutral component @xmath68 with @xmath69 is decomposed into the majorana fermions ( @xmath11 and @xmath70 ) as @xmath71 and they should not be degenerate in mass , so that the dm direct detection is suppressed .",

    "the cp - violating higgs couplings contribute to the electron edm via the barr - zee diagrams at the two - loop level  @xcite .",

    "the cp - violating anomalous @xmath86-@xmath90-@xmath91 coupling also contributes to the electron edm .",
    "however , the anomalous coupling should be zero at the one - loop level if the components in isospin multiplets are degenerate in mass .",
