    "the onset of disruptive instabilities has long stood as a puzzling barrier to the realization of magnetic confinement fusion energy in tokamaks , by preventing access to the required high confined energy regimes . as the toroidal current and confined energy are increased , a stability boundary can be crossed , typically for the @xmath0 tearing instability , which grows on a timescale slow with respect to the fast alfvn wave , but fast with respect to the global resistive time .",
    "these tearing instabilities reconnect the magnetic field at magnetic surfaces with which the perturbation is resonant @xcite .",
    "because the instability is small at the onset , the stability boundary and initial growth of the mode can be described by linearization of the equations to obtain an exponential growth .",
    "as the instability progresses , it forms magnetic islands which grow at an algebraic rate @xcite , and are nonlinear in their evolution at the minimum amplitude at which they are first detected @xcite .",
    "in fact , if the instability is marginally linearly stable , it can be easily destabilized into a nonlinear growth through coupling with another unstable mode , such as a sawtooth mode @xcite . as the mode grows to a significant island size",

    "neoclassical tearing modes can limit the achievable @xmath5 , the ratio of pressure to magnetic field energy , and often cause disruptions @xcite .",

    "this type of energetic ion population has been shown to interact with a variety of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) instabilities : resistive wall modes @xcite , sawtooth oscillations @xcite , toroidal alfvn eigenmodes @xcite , and more recently resistive mhd modes @xcite . understanding the physics driving the initial onset of the observed instabilities that cause disruptions can lead to their avoidance , and is of utmost importance in the development of a stable operational scenario for iter",

    "ion driving and damping effects are governed by the precession frequency of particles relative to the mode frequency in both cases .",
    "a number of effects can cause a finite frequency response in the resonant layer @xcite , including two - fluid species , toroidal curvature and parallel dynamics , all of which can alter the stability and mode locking boundaries .",
    "this can be particularly important when the equilibrium rotation is finite and different regimes of plasma response are traversed @xcite . however , the physics of the shear effects on the interaction with the energetic ions presented in this paper , and the resulting trends in stability , should remain intact .    while the kinetic effects of energetic electrons on the layer response @xcite can be important in high temperature tokamaks , in particular when the plasma enters the semi - collisional and collisionless regimes , the kinetic ion interaction presented in this paper is dominantly effective in the ideal outer region .",
    "this stems from the mass ratio of the electrons to ions , and the spatial scales of their orbits at the relevant temperatures .",
