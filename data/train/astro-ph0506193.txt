    "during the past decade , over two thousand radio continuum sources have been surveyed at milliarcsecond ( mas ) resolution with the techniques of very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "optical identifications and redshifts are time - consuming to obtain and are available only for a few hundred sources @xcite .",
    "for those sources , the accepted paradigm is that vlbi imaging traces the relativistic outflows on parsec scales that emerge from the accretion regions of supermassive black holes .",
    "these traditional surveys rely on self - calibration techniques and are therefore biased by targeting sources brighter than about 50  mjy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , these surveys only target sources with flat radio spectra , to enhance the prospects that synchroton - self - absorbed emission will be present on mas scales .",
    "do the parsec - scale properties of the fainter radio population , selected independent of radio spectra , differ from the properties inferred for the brighter , flat - spectrum population ?",
    "addressing this question is now feasible because of three recent developments .",
    "first , the technique of phase referencing is now in routine use on vlbi arrays @xcite , enabling astrometric imaging of sources fainter than 50  mjy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "second , wide - area radio surveys with sub - arcminute resolution have defined source populations at millijansky levels ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "third , the prior diffiulties with obtaining optical identifications and redshifts can be mitigated by focusing on faint radio sources within known optical deep fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "combining these three developments , the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was used to conduct phase - referenced observations at 5.0  ghz of faint radio sources in the 9  deg@xmath3 of the noao botes field @xcite .",
    "the noao limit of @xmath4  ( vega )  mag means it is feasible that many of these faint sources can be identified , dominantly with accretion - powered radio galaxies and quasars @xcite , and efficient follow - up with a multi - object fiber spectrograph is possible .",
    "the idea for this type of vlbi survey was first suggested by @xcite .",
    "@xcite are pursuing a different strategy that will , eventually , include some sources too faint for vlbi self - calibration ; that survey is targeting a complete sample of 95 radio sources selected independently of the presence of compact emission and at redshifts @xmath5 .",
    "also , @xcite have been using a single vlbi baseline ( arecibo - effelsberg ) to perform a survey of approximately 1000 radio sources , independent of source flux density , size or spectrum .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 describes the sample selection for the vlba survey , including the identification status in the @xmath0 band available from @xcite .",
    "the vlba observations and calibration are described in section  3 , while section  4 describes the vlba imaging strategies .",
    "the discussion begins with an overview of the vlba survey ( section 5.1 ) then explores implications related to the vlba detection rate ( section 5.2 ) , the vlba parsec - scale structures ( section 5.3 ) , and the characteristics of the eight vlba detections unidentifed in the noao botes survey ( section 5.4 ) .",
    "section  6 closes with a summary of this paper and also outlines future steps concerning this sample of faint radio sources ( rector et al.2005 , in preparation ) .    to facilitate comparison with other analyses in the noao botes field @xcite",
    ", this paper will use vega magnitudes and a flat @xmath6cdm cosmology with @xmath7  km  s@xmath8  mpc@xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "also , all quoted uncertainties will correspond to 1  @xmath11 gaussian errors , including those for poisson counting errors as tabulated by @xcite .",
    "the faint radio sources were selected from the 1999 july 21 version of the first catalog ( faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to have peak flux densities above 10  mjy at 5 resolution and deconvolved major diameters of less than 3 at 1.4  ghz .",
    "figure  1 shows the locations of these 76 faint and compact sources , while table  1 lists for each source the position - encoded first name in column  1 and the peak flux density from first at 1.4  ghz in column  2 .",
    "column  3 gives the integrated flux density at 1.4  ghz obtained from the 2002 july 18 version of the nvss catalog at 45 resolution ( nrao vla sky survey ; * ? ? ?",
    "each first source has a localization ellipse diameter at 5 @xmath11 of about 1.0 , so it is prudent to ensure that the vlba search region covers a diameter of at least 1.0 .",
    "a cross - correlation of the 76 first sources with the noao @xmath0 band catalog @xcite was made .",
    "only identifications within a total offset of 3 were considered as potential matches , although none were found with offsets between 2 - 3 .",
    "rector et al.(2005 , in preparation ) will discuss these noao identifications in detail .",
    "for now , we note only that 55 of these faint radio sources have been identified with accretion - powered radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "column  4 of table  1 indicates the identification status in the @xmath0 band of the first sources .",
    "on vla scales at 1.4  ghz , the ratio of the peak flux density from first ( column 2 , table  1 ) to the integrated flux density from the nvss ( column 3 , table 1 ) is a measure of the compactness of the first sources .",
    "this compactness ratio is plotted in figure  2 as a function of the nvss flux density , with plot symbols encoding the identification status for the first sources ( column  4 , table  1 ) .",
    "the first and nvss observations occured in 1994 july and 1995 april , respectively . in the absence of source variability ,",
    "all sources are expected to be located within the region defined by the dashed lines .",
    "figure  2 shows that the compactness ratios span the full range of possibilites arising from source - resolution effects ( from zero to unity ) , while the few instances of ratios significantly exceeding unity could plausibly be attributed to source variability .",
    "figure  2 also shows that the unidentified sources are spread throughout a wide range of compactness ratios .",
    "the vlba was used to observe the 76 first sources and calibrators during four observing segments described in table  2 . for each segment ,",
    "antenna separations spanned 240 km to 8600 km .",
    "data were acquired during about 6.5 hours in dual circular polarizations with 4-level sampling and at a center frequency 4.97949  ghz with a bandwidth of 32  mhz per polarization .",
    "this bandwidth was synthesized from 4 contiguous baseband channels , each of width 8  mhz .",
    "a strong calibrator 3c279 was observed to align the phases of the independent baseband channels .",
    "observation and correlation assumed a coordinate equinox of 2000 .",
    "correlation also assumed an integration time of 2 seconds , 32 spectral points per baseband channel , and a single pass at the _ a priori _ position of each first source . while there were a few instances where several first sources fell within the primary beam of a vlba antenna , correlation was done only for the first source at the peak of the primary beam .",
    "phase - referenced observations were made in the nodding style at elevations above 20 .",
    "successive 80-second observations of three first sources were preceded and followed by a 60-second observation of the phase , rate , and delay calibrator ( referred to as a phase calibrator hereafter ) listed in table  2 , leading to a switching time of 5  minutes . _ a priori _ positions for the phase calibrators were available in the international celestial reference frame ( extension 1 ) ( icrf - ext.1 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so all first sources detected with the vlba will have their positions measured in that frame .",
    "each first source was observed during six snapshots spread over time to enhance coverage in the @xmath12 plane .",
    "for each segment , a maximum switching angle of 2.5 was used to assign first sources to the segment s phase calibrator . as is evident from figure  1",
    ", this procedure failed for one source ( first j143152.544@xmath13340110.15 ) , for which a maximum switching angle of 2.6 was required .",
    "two phase calibrators were used during segment 3 to reach different first sources , so that segment is conceptually split into segments 3a and 3b depending on which phase calibrator was used ( table  2 ) . to help assess repeatability ,",
    "some first sources were observed during two segments .",
    "an observing frequency of 5.0  ghz was used to optimize the chances that phase - referencing would succeed for all switching angles ; phase - referencing at lower ( higher ) frequencies can be harmed by ionospheric ( tropospheric ) effects @xcite .",
    "figure  1 and table  2 also identify check calibrators that were observed similarly to each first source but with the switching angles indicated .",
    "those calibrator observations were intended to serve two purposes .",
    "first , the tabulated positions are accurate to better than 1.3  mas per coordinate in the icrf - ext.1 and can be used to check the differential astrometry .",
    "second , the calibrator data can be used to check the coherence losses .",
    "phase calibrators for some segments served as check calibrators for other segments .",
    "check calibrators j1416@xmath133444 , f14543631 , and f14653289 were also taken from the table s references .",
    "the latter two check calibrators were originally selected from @xcite to improve upon the calibrator density offered in @xcite .    for each segment ,",
    "data editing and calibration were done with the nrao aips software and following the strategies outlined in appendix c of the nrao aips cookbook .",
    "data deletion was based on system flags recorded at observation and tape weights recorded at correlation .",
    "corrections for the dispersive delays caused by the earth s ionosphere were made using electron - content models based on global positioning system data and derived at the jet propulsion laboratory .",
    "vlba system temperatures and gains were used to set the amplitude scale to an accuracy of about 5% , after first correcting for sampler errors .",
    "the visibility data for the phase calibrator were used to generate phase - referenced visibility data for the appropriate check calibrators ( table  2 ) and for the subset of first sources observed during that segment ( table  1 ) .",
    "in contrast , the visibility data for the phase calibrator and the strong calibrator 3c279 were self - calibrated .",
    "parallel and cross - hand correlations were obtained for each segment .",
    "a polarization calibration was done for the first segment , but each first source was so faint in stokes @xmath0 that stokes @xmath14 and @xmath15 were emission - free and did not usefully constrain the linear polarization percentage @xmath16 . thus for later segments",
    "a polarization calibration was not attempted . for all segments , however , the emission - free information in stokes @xmath14 for each first source proved to be a useful cross - check of the detection threshold adopted in stokes @xmath0 .",
    "the aips task imagr was used to image the stokes @xmath0 and @xmath14 emission from each first source and each calibrator . to reduce side - lobe levels for these vlba multi - snapshot data ,",
    "the visibility data were weighted uniformly with robustness 0.5 and a sensitivity loss of about 10% relative to natural weighting was incurred . a two - stage approach to the imaging was taken .",
    "the first image , not cleaned , spanned 4096 @xmath17 0.35  mas in each coordinate and had a typical angular resolution characterized as an elliptical gaussian with fwhm dimensions of 3.0  mas by 1.5  mas aligned nearly north - south ( referred to as a resolution of 2  mas hereafter ) .",
    "this image is within the field - of - view limits set by time and bandwidth averaging @xcite ; the most constraining limit follows from accepting , at the field edge , a 10% drop in the peak amplitude due to averaging over each 8-mhz baseband channel , resulting in an elliptical field of view aligned nearly north - south with major and minor axes of 3000  mas and 1500  mas , respectively . a search @xmath11 was obtained by forming a histogram of brightness variations from pixel to pixel within the search region and evaluating the root - mean - square of that histogram .",
    "given the array , observation , and imaging parameters , a detection threshold of 6 @xmath11 @xmath18 2  mjy was adopted within the search region , a square of side 1400  mas .",
    "values for the search @xmath11 vary from image to image and appear in column 6 of table  1 . for stokes @xmath0 , the right ascension and declination of the peak of that detection was recorded . for stokes @xmath14 ,",
    "the emission - free search region was analysed to cross - check and validate the 6 @xmath11 detection threshold for stokes @xmath0 . for a strong",
    "stokes @xmath0 detection , the quoted value for the search @xmath11 is typically higher than expected from thermal sensitivity , because the histogram for the search region is corrupted by side - lobes from the strong detection ( the high - valued pixels of a strong stokes @xmath0 detection were excluded from the histogram ) .",
    "analysis of this first set of images resulted in vlba detections of 30 of the first sources in table  1 and all calibrators .",
    "a second image of stokes @xmath0 was made for each vlba detection , including the 30 faint sources and all calibrators .",
    "this second image spanned 512 @xmath17 0.35  mas in each coordinate and was made by shifting the tangent point , as derived from the right ascension and declination of the peak in the first image , to the field center .",
    "these shifted images were cleaned in regions centered on the detections and spanning 2.1  mas east - west and 3.5  mas north - south for the isolated detections but spanning customized regions for the extended detections .",
    "these shifts were finite for the phase - referenced and cleaned images shown in figures  3 - 5 but zero by definition for the self - calibrated and cleaned images of the phase and strong calibrators .",
    "residual errors during phase referencing will degrade the point - source sensitivity of the vlba . to quantify the effect of this loss of coherence",
    ", individual 80-second observations of the check calibrators listed in table  2 were phase self - calibrated , imaged , and cleaned .",
    "the ratios of the peak intensities in the self - calibrated images were 1.0 to 1.4 times the peak intensities in the phase - referenced images , as tabulated in column  10 of table  2 .",
    "observations of these calibrators required switching angles of 0.6 to 2.7 , but switching angles of 2.6 or less were needed to reach the first sources . while there may be some segment - to - segment variations , a conservative correction for the loss of point - source sensitivity is about 1.2 . for the vlba nondetections in table  1 ,",
    "the quoted 6 @xmath11 upper limits for a point source have been increased by this factor .",
    "the bright components in the phase - referenced images ( figs .",
    "3 - 5 ) appear to be slightly resolved , but this apparent resolution is probably mostly artificial and due to the residual phase errors discussed in subsection 4.1 . in most cases ,",
    "a single elliptical gaussian was fit to each of these vlba images to yield the position peak and integrated flux densities quoted in table  1 .",
    "for a few images , two elliptical gaussians were fit and their integrated flux densities were summed and tabulated along with the position of the brighter gaussian . for the source showing very diffuse structure , areal integration yielded the tabulated integrated flux density and a parabolic fit of the brightest structure yielded the tabulated position .",
    "a few sources were too weak for reliable gaussian fitting ; each of them is considered as a provisional vlba detection , with a parabolic fit yielding the tabulated peak flux density ( corrected for coherence losses ) and position .",
    "for the vlba integrated flux density , no corrections were made for coherence losses and the tabulated error is the quadratic sum of the 5% scale error and the error in the gaussian model . although the phase errors leading to coherence loss do broaden the vlba detections , coherence corrections were not made because the flux densities can be largely recovered with gaussian fitting .",
    "for the vlba positions , the calculated error per coordinate is the quadratic sum of three terms : ( a ) the 1 @xmath11 error in the phase calibrator position ; ( b ) the 1 @xmath11 error in the differential astrometry ; and ( c ) the 1 @xmath11 error in the gaussian fit .",
    "as indicated in the note to table  2 , term ( a ) is always less than 1  mas in one dimension ; to be conservative , 1  mas is adopted for term ( a ) . to quantify term ( b",
    ") , the positions of the check calibrators in table  2 were measured in the phase - referenced images and subtracted from their _ a priori _ positions , leading to the position corrections , in right ascension and declination , tabulated in column  11 of table  2 . observations of these check calibrators required switching angles of 0.6 to 2.7 , but switching angles of 2.6 or less were needed to reach the first sources . while there may be some segment - to - segment variations ,",
    "a conservative estimate for term ( b ) is 2  mas in one dimension . for the weakest vlba detections of first sources , term ( c ) has a worst - case value of 0.3  mas in the north - south direction and half that in the east - west direction ; to be conservative , 1  mas is adopted for term ( c ) .",
    "thus for all the vlba detections reported in table  2 , a conservative estimate of the position error per coordinate is the quadratic sum of 1  mas , 2  mas , and 1  mas , or 2.5  mas .",
    "seventy - six faint radio sources were selected from the first catalog to have peak flux densities above 10  mjy at 5 resolution and deconvolved major diameters of less than 3 at 1.4  ghz . the compactness ratio on vla scales at 1.4  ghz , as defined in section  3 ,",
    "is plotted in figure  6 as a function of the vlba photometry at 5.0  ghz ( column  9 , table  1 ) . as for figure  2 ,",
    "the plot symbols encode the identification status for the first sources ( column  5 , table  1 ) .",
    "figure  6 shows that vlba detections occur over the full range of compactness ratios .",
    "thirty of the 76 first sources , or 39@xmath1% , were detected with the vlba at 5.0  ghz with peak flux densities above 6 @xmath19 2  mjy at 2  mas resolution . for 20 similar but somewhat fainter sources in the _ spitzer _ first - look survey @xcite , twelve sources , or 60@xmath20% , were detected with the vlba at 1.4  ghz , with peak flux densities above 2  mjy at 9 mas resolution @xcite .",
    "equally good success rates can be expected when vlba phase - referencing in the nodding style is used to target similar first sources anywhere in that survey s 10,000  deg@xmath3 . moreover , among the vlba detections reported in table  1 , first j142910.223@xmath13352946.86 was used successfully as an in - beam phase calibrator @xcite at 1.4  ghz for a vlbi survey of tens of sources covering 0.28  deg@xmath3 in the noao botes field @xcite .",
    "this illustrates how the stronger vlba detections can , themselves , serve as vlbi phase calibrators , potentially opening up much of the radio sky to phase - referencing in either the nodding or the in - beam styles .",
    "for the adopted cosmology , the achieved vlba resolution of 2  mas correponds to 17  pc or finer , while each of the panels in figures  3 - 5 spans 170  pc or less .",
    "most vlba detections at 5.0  ghz are unresolved or appear to be slightly resolved , with rest - frame brightness temperatures in the range @xmath21  k , or more if truly unresolved .",
    "such high brightness temperatures , in combination with the optical identifications discussed below , imply that these vlba detections mark accretion - driven outflows on parsec scales . also , one vlba detection ( first j142905.105@xmath13342641.06 ) appears quite diffuse and elongated , as discussed in the appendix .",
    "five others ( first j143121.320@xmath13332808.95 , first j143152.544@xmath13340110.15 , first j143449.111@xmath13354246.98 , first j143752.050@xmath13351940.08 , and first j143841.949@xmath13335809.48 ) show either double or core - jet structures , as mentioned in the appendix .",
    "the structures of these six vlba detections further enforce an outflow scenario , and we now consider some issues that can be addressed based on these structures .",
    "could some of the five vlba detections showing double or core - jet structures eventually yield evidence for counterjets , important for strong tests of unified schemes @xcite ? for sources selected independent of their radio spectra , more",
    "counterjets can be expected adjacent to core - jet structures , but may elude discovery until follow - up vlba observations with higher sensitivity .",
    "might some of the five vlba detections showing double or core - jet structures be compact symmetric objects ( csos ) , young systems offering insights into evolutionary models for radio galaxies and strong tests of unified schemes @xcite ?",
    "from vlbi imaging of a bright and flat - spectrum sample @xcite , @xcite note that about 7% show cso structures .",
    "using this as a rough guide for faint sources selected independent of their radio spectra , two cso candidates can be expected among the 30 vlba detections .",
    "but for sources selected independent of their radio spectra , more symmetric core - jet structures are to be expected , giving them the appearance of csos in the discovery images .",
    "thus follow - up vlba observations at other frequencies will be required to distinquish between candidate core - jets and candidate csos .",
    "finally , is it likely that some of the five vlba detections showing double or core - jet structures could be gravitational millilenses , caused by a cosmic population of supermassive black holes @xcite ?",
    "from vlbi imaging of a bright and flat - spectrum sample @xcite , @xcite find that for image separations 1.5 - 50  mas , the upper limit at 95%-confidence to the expected millilensing rate is about one lens per 430 sources . using this as a rough guide for faint sources selected independent of their radio spectra ,",
    "then two implications follow . first , the prospect of discovering one millilens candidate among 30 vlba detections is slim .",
    "second , expanding the present vlba survey by a factor of 14 would lead to equally good constraints on the expected millilensing rate .",
    "more than a thousand sources would have been examined in the process , with about four in ten being vlba detections searched for lensing signatures .",
    "this vlba survey method uses 0.5 hours to observe three sources , so repeating the survey in 13 other regions would require additional observations totaling 164 hours .",
    "fifty - seven of the 70 first sources , or 81% , were identified with accretion - powered radio galaxies and quasars using the noao data @xcite .",
    "a similar identification percentage applies to the 27 vlba detections , as 24 , or 89% , were identified .",
    "the three vlba detections with fainter optical hosts must still mark active nuclei .",
    "one of these three is an apparent double with an 8-mas separation ( first j143121.320@xmath13332808.95 ) , while the other two ( first j142738.625@xmath13330756.96 and first j143643.209@xmath13352222.98 ) are unresolved or appear to be slightly resolved .",
    "these three unidentified vlba detections at 5.0  ghz have rest - frame brightness temperatures in the range @xmath22  k , or more if truly unresolved .",
    "this is similar to the range of @xmath23  k for the identified vlba detections that pin - point the active nuclei of the accretion - powered radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "the three unidentified vlba detections fainter than 25.5  mag in the @xmath0 band are likely candidates for being optically - obscured active nuclei at high redshift .",
    "also in the noao botes field , @xcite recognized a similar case involving a vlbi detection at 1.4  ghz of an unidentified 20-mjy westerbork source , while @xcite report numerous cases of unidentified vla sources in the mjy regime at 1.4  ghz , for which analysis of their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) supports an accretion - power origin .",
    "rector et al .",
    "( 2005 , in preparation ) will investigate the seds of the three unidentified vlba detections mentioned above , paying particular attention to a comparison of their seds to those of the unidentified vla sources analyzed by @xcite .",
    "the vlba was used at 5.0  ghz to obtain phase - referenced images of 76 sources in the noao botes field , selected from the first catalog to have peak flux densities above 10  mjy at 5 resolution and deconvolved major diameters of less than 3 at 1.4  ghz .",

    "most vlba detections are unresolved or slightly resolved .",
    "the resulting high brightness temperatures , in combination with the optical identifications , imply that these vlba detections mark accretion - driven outflows on parsec scales .",
    "moreover , the elongated structures of six vlba detections further enforce an outflow scenario .",
    "three vlba detections are unidentified and fainter than 25.5  mag in the @xmath0 band , similar to another vlbi detection reported by @xcite . these four vlbi detections are likely candidates for being optically - obscured active nuclei at high redshift , so understanding them is essential for completing the cosmic census of supermassive black holes .    for these faint radio sources in the noao botes field ,",
    "the next steps involve obtaining redshifts , assessing intrinsic properties , examining the properties of the optical counterparts and their cluster environments , assembling the seds of the active nuclei , and tying data for the botes field to the icrf .",
    "these topics will be covered by rector et al .",
    "( 2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "here we simply note that concerning the seds , for the 30 vlba detections in table  1 , the photometry quantifies the emission from the active nuclei at 5.0  ghz ; while for the 46 vlba nondetections in table  1 , the photometry imposes upper limits on the emission from the active nuclei at 5.0  ghz .",

    "finally , we note that concerning the icrf , twenty - four of the vlba detections are identified ( column  5 , table  1 , fig .",
