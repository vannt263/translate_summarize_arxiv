    "the nearest bright hard x - ray source , 1a 1742 - 294 , was active during the first observation only .",

    "we are unable to rule out the presence of contaminating flux above this energy as there are a number of hard x - ray sources in the large 4.5@xmath164.5@xmath17 fov .",
    "we note that the consistency between the model normalizations for the pin & gso spectra would argue against the presence of a significant contaminating flux above 100 kev .",
    "our final good spectral range is xis0 , xis3 : 2 - 10 kev , xis1 : 2 - 10 kev , pin : 12 - 70 kev , and gso : 50 - 300 kev .",
    "additionally the data were rebinned prior to fitting in xspec with the ftool grppha by a factors of 4 and 8 for the xis / pin & gso spectra respectively . as the s / n in the second epoch is higher , we focus on these spectra .",
    "the results for the fits to the data from epoch i , which are similar to those from epoch ii , are presented in table [ specfit_params1 ] .",
    "the resultant spectrum ( 2 - 300 kev ) was initially fit with a model consisting of a power - law modified by interstellar extinction ( i.e. pha*po ) .",
    "the fit is found to be a poor one ( @xmath20 ) with large residuals present at higher energies . to account for these residuals",
    ", we considered 2 additional power - law models ; a model with a cutoff at high energies ( cutoffpl ) and a broken power - law ( bknpo ) .",
    "the cutoffpl provides a significant improvement over the power - law model alone @xmath21 , with the cutoff energy found to be @xmath0 150 kev ( epoch ii ) .",
    "the broken power - law provides the best fit to the data @xmath22 , with the spectrum observed to break from a very hard power - law , @xmath23 1.4 , to a softer power - law , @xmath23 1.8 , at an energy of approximately 7 kev .",
    "this clearly points towards a second component at low energies in the observed spectrum , with the most obvious culprit being thermal emission from a geometrically thin optically thick accretion disc @xcite , see table [ specfit_params1 ] for the detailed fit model parameters .",
    "inspection of the residuals from this model reveals a number of features in the xis spectral range . at low energies ( 2  3 kev ) , there remains a feature consistent with the expected position of the s xv line ( 2.45 kev ) , in addition to the presence of known systematic features in the 2.1  2.4 kev region . at energies 9 - 10 kev there is an unidentified residual ( in the form of an excess possibly due to the background although its actual origin is unclear ) , as such in all further modelling both of these regions are ignored .",
    "a large residual also exists at energies above the iron k absorption edge ( e = 7.11 kev ) .",
    "it is clear that we must accurately account for this spectral feature .",
    "to do this we use the variable iron abundance absorption model available in xspec  zvfeabs .",
    "the absorption edge energy was frozen at 7.11 kev ( allowing it to vary does not significantly improve the fit ) . as there exists a degeneracy in this model between the hydrogen column density and the metal / iron abundance ,",
    "@xmath24 was frozen at a value of @xmath25 in agreement with the previously determined _ chandra _ value @xcite .",
    "a blackbody accretion disc was now added to the power - law models above ( e.g. zvfeabs*(diskbb+po ) ) and the fitting was repeated .",
    "the resulting fit is significantly improved and is equal to the broken power - law model , see table [ specfit_params1 ] . in this case",
    "there is no difference between the cutoff power - law and power - law models .",
    "however , the cutoff energy for both epochs pegs at the xspec hard limit of 500 kev , formally we find a lower limit for the cutoff energy of @xmath0 340 kev & @xmath0 390 kev at the 90% confidence level in epochs i & ii respectively .",
    "it is rare that spectral breaks are restricted to such high energies in the low - hard state and this may be related to the fact that some models require only a small seed photon fraction to fit the data .",
    "the accretion disc is found to have a temperature of @xmath0 0.4 kev , while the disc normalization points towards a small inner radius for the accretion disc .",
    "the metal abundance is found to be high in agreement with previous _ asca _",
    "observations where the iron abundance was measured to be @xmath0 2x solar @xcite .",
    "we find an iron abundance of @xmath26 and a metals abundance of @xmath27 relative to solar abundances .",
    "the disc normalization may be used to estimate the inner radius of the accretion disc when knowledge of the distance and inclination are available , as norm @xmath28 .",
    "this estimate is subject to a number of well known corrections , e.g spectral hardening @xcite , inner radius @xcite and a number of others which are difficult to quantify , e.g. zero torque inner boundary condition @xcite and radiative transfer effects @xcite . assuming a distance of 8.5 kpc , we measure an inner radius of @xmath0 250 ( cos_i_@xmath29 ) km and @xmath0 120 ( cos_i_@xmath29 ) km for epochs i & ii respectively assuming a power - law continuum ( see table [ specfit_params1 ] ) .",
    "we note that the isco for a schwarzschild ( kerr ) black hole is 6 ( 1.23 ) @xmath30 , for a 10 m@xmath31 black hole this is equivalent to a radius of 90 ( 15 ) km .",
    "the inclination of 1e 1740.7 - 2942   is unconstrained ; however , the presence of a bi - polar radio jet @xcite would suggest a high inclination .",
    "for instance an inclination angle of 70@xmath17 , will result in an increase in the inner radii above by a factor of 3 . nonetheless the inner radii measured here are consistent with being close to the isco , i.e. @xmath32 .",
    "we test for the presence of a broad iron line by adding a laor component to the model , whose energy is restricted to the 6.4  6.97 kev range ( q = 3 , @xmath33 = 400 , i = 70@xmath17 ) .",
    "the presence of a broad line ( @xmath34 ) is only marginally required ( 99% confidence level as measured with an f - test ) . as such we freeze the inner radius at 3 @xmath30 and",
    "step the line energy through the energy region outlined above . for a relativistic line centered at 6.4 kev",
    ", we can place an upper limit in the ew of this line of @xmath0 60 ev , for higher energies , e.g. 6.7 , 6.9 kev the upper limit increases to @xmath0 150 , 200 ev respectively .",
    "likewise in order to investigate the possible contribution due to disc reflection at higher energies ( 20  40 kev ) , the best fit power - law from above was convolved with the reflection model of @xcite reflect*po .",
    "this model was then relativistically blurred ( kdblur ) to account for the proximity of the accretion disc to the isco as indicated above .",
    "the inclination was held fixed ( cos_i _ = 0.45 ) , while the abundances of metals were tied to those of the absorption component .",
    "any reflection fraction is negligible ( f @xmath0 1% ) .",
    "formally , we find an upper limit for disc reflection of 10% at the 90% confidence level .",
    "@xcite have detected numerous absorption lines , in particular fe xxv , xxvi , attributed to a disc wind in soft state observations of the microquasar grs 1915 + 105 . earlier hard state observations by @xcite had also detected some of these lines ; however , they were significantly weaker . here",
    "we test for the presence of narrow gaussian absorption lines in the fe region of the spectrum .",
    "no significant absorption lines are detected , at the 90% confidence level we place an upper limit on the equivalent width of any absorption line of @xmath14 3 ev .",

    "they fit the spectrum with a two component thermal comptonization model ( @xmath91 ) although they are unable to rule out non - thermal processes . indeed fitting the spectrum above 200 kev with a power - law produces a high quality fit ( @xmath92 ) .",
