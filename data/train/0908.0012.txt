    "replica exchange monte carlo ( mc ) , also known as parallel tempering , was independently introduced by swendsen and wang  @xcite and hukushima and nemoto  @xcite for studying spin glasses .",
    "replica exchange mc is an important tool in many areas of computational physics  @xcite where the free energy landscape has many metastable minima separated by barriers .",
    "it is the standard method for simulating spin glasses and is used for protein folding  @xcite and lattice gauge theory  @xcite .    in parallel tempering many replicas of the system are simulated in parallel using a standard mc technique for sampling the gibbs distribution such as the metropolis - hastings algorithm .",
    "the replicas are simulated at different temperatures .",
    "the fixed sequence of temperatures extends from some low temperature where the equilibration time is very long to some high temperature where the equilibration time is short .",
    "replica exchange moves permit replicas at adjacent temperatures to swap temperatures in a way that satisfies detailed balance so that the entire set of replicas equilibrates at the prescribed set of temperatures .",
    "the heuristic motivation for replica exchange is that replicas can diffuse from the lowest to the highest temperature and back to the lowest temperature . during this ` roundtrip ' equilibration occurs at high temperature so that when the replica returns to the lowest temperature its state is independent of the original state .",
    "a number of studies have focused on optimizing replica exchange mc by choosing the set of replica temperatures and other parameters to minimize the round - trip time  @xcite .",
    "replica exchange mc is also closely related both to simulated annealing and various generalized ensemble methods  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the efficiency of replica exchange mc in the context of two very simple free energy landscapes that , respectively , highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the method .",
    "the first example is a free energy landscape with two minima separated by a barrier such as occurs in the @xmath0 free energy functional . in the low temperature phase where the potential has",
    "a double well , local dynamics fully equilibrates in a time that is exponential in the barrier height though equilibration within a single well is typically much faster .",
    "as we shall see , replica exchange can reduce the barrier crossing time from exponential to a polynomial in the barrier height .    for the double well potential",
    ", we show that the equilibration time is longest when the free energy difference between the wells is a few @xmath1 or less .",
    "in this situation , the gibbs measure gives significant weight to both macrostates and equilibration involves diffusive motion of replicas .",
    "when the free energy difference between the wells is much larger than @xmath1 , equilibration depends on much faster ballistic motion of replicas . in the context of spin glasses , a free energy landscapes with multiple free energy minima",
    "is expected . in the discussion section",
    ", we argue that the longer equilibration time for nearly degenerate free energy minima may lead to an overestimate of the probability that the spin overlap in spin glasses is near zero .",
    "this reasoning suggests caution in interpreting simulations for the spin overlap .",
    "the second free energy landscape to be considered is the ` golf course ' potential .",
    "here almost all of the microstates are degenerate excited states and an exponentially small fraction of states are degenerate ground states .",
    "this model has a pseudo - first - order transition between a low temperature phase where the system is almost always in a ground state and a high temperature phase where the system is almost always in an excited state . for this particularly nasty system",
    ", replica exchange is of little help equilibrating the low temperature phase . the equilibration time is controlled by the time taken to find a ground state and this time",
    "is not reduced by bringing the system first to a higher temperature .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : remc ] we introduce replica exchange monte carlo section . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dw ] we analyze the behavior of replica exchange monte carlo for the double well free energy landscape both analytically and via numerical simulations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : golf ] we introduce the golf course potential and analyze replica exchange for this potential .",
    "the paper closes with a discussion in sec .  [",
    "sec : disc ] .",
    "replica exchange monte carlo is designed to equilibrate a set of replicas of a system at inverse temperatures , @xmath2 each of the @xmath3 replicas is equipped with dynamics that equilibrates it at its respective temperature .",
    "in addition , replica exchange moves are permitted between replicas at neighboring temperatures . in a replica exchange move",
    ", the temperatures of the two replicas are swapped . in order to satisfy detailed balance and insure that the entire set of replicas equilibrates , the probability for accepting a replica exchange move between replicas at temperatures @xmath4 and @xmath5 is given by @xmath6.\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the respective energies of the replicas that were originally at @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "if the replica exchange move is accepted , the replica whose local dynamics was set at inverse temperature @xmath4 is now set at @xmath5 and vice versa .",
    "in this section we consider a simple free energy with two minima such as occurs , for example , in a @xmath0 theory .",
    "the free energy associated with each minima or well is , @xmath9 where @xmath10 labels the well ; the deep well is indicated by @xmath11 and the shallow well by @xmath12 .",
    "although the free energy landscape itself is not explicitly prescribed , we assume that free energy at the saddle point between the wells is zero so that @xmath13 is the free energy barrier for transitions between wells . from the free energy we can obtain the internal energy @xmath14 and energy fluctuations by differentiations with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "the internal energy , which is the expectation of the energy @xmath7 is @xmath15 and the variance @xmath16 of the energy is @xmath17 the free energy difference @xmath18 between the wells is controlled by @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) and given by , @xmath21    given this free energy difference , the probability @xmath22 of being in the deep well ( i.  e.  the expectation of @xmath10 ) at inverse temperature @xmath4 is @xmath23 to completely specify the statics of the model , we assume that the energy distribution in each well is a normal distribution with mean @xmath14 and variance @xmath16 .      we suppose that each replica is equipped with single temperature dynamics that is much faster than the rate of replica exchange attempts .",
    "thus , for each replica exchange attempt , the energies of the two replicas are chosen independently from normal distributions for the given replica s temperature and well index .",
    "the time scale for transitions between wells by single temperature dynamics for @xmath24 is order @xmath25 , however , in the analysis and simulations that follow , we do not permit single temperature dynamics to effect transitions between the wells except at @xmath26 .",
    "this simplification leads to an underestimate of the equilibration time for replica exchange since the replicas near @xmath26 may also contribute to barrier crossings between the wells . since the entropy of each well is the same at @xmath27 and since there is no barrier between the wells here , we assume an initial condition for parallel tempering in which each well is equally likely to be populated for every @xmath24 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the replica exchange dynamics described above satisfies detailed balance with respect to the normal distribution of the energies in the two wells and the probability @xmath22 given in ( [ eq : pp ] ) for being in the deep well .",
    "the normal distribution of energies within each well is maintained by fiat while @xmath22 is established via replica exchange .",
    "our goal is to understand the time scale for reaching this equilibrium well distribution .    given the dynamical assumptions it is not difficult to calculate the average rate of replica exchange for the double well model .",
    "let @xmath28 be the average rate of replica exchange if the two replicas are , respectively , at inverse temperatures @xmath4 and @xmath5 in wells @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "without loss of generality , assume @xmath31 .",
    "the rate @xmath28 is obtained by averaging ( [ eq : reprob ] ) over the energy distribution , @xmath32 ) .\\ ] ] here @xmath33 is an average over the normal distributions of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the energies in the respective wells at the given temperatures .",
    "the explicit expression for the replica exchange rate is @xmath34      first consider the simpler case of degenerate wells ( @xmath35 ) , it is not hard to show that the two terms in ( [ eq : r ] ) are equal and , using ( [ eq : u ] ) and ( [ eq : sig ] ) , the gaussian integrals yield , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the complementary error function .",
    "the replica exchange rates are independent of the well indices and the dynamics of replica exchange is diffusive .",
    "given the replica exchange rate , we can estimate the equilibration time as follows .",
    "suppose there are @xmath3 equally spaced replicas with inverse temperatures ranging from @xmath38 to @xmath26 .",
    "equilibration requires that a replica in one well at the lowest temperature @xmath38 diffuses to @xmath26 where the well is randomized .",
    "up to constant factors , the equilibration time @xmath39 for @xmath3 replicas scales like the mean first passage time for a random walk between the ends of a chain of @xmath3 sites with hopping rate @xmath40 , with a reflecting boundary at @xmath38 and an absorbing boundary at @xmath26 .",
    "the mean first passage time for this process is @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "thus , from ( [ eq : rate ] ) @xmath42 from the asymptotic behavior of the error function , @xmath43 we see that the optimum number of replicas should scale as the square root of the well depth , @xmath44 .",
    "the replica exchange rate is then order unity and the optimized equilibration time in this diffusive regime , @xmath45 is proportional to the well depth , @xmath46 since the optimum number of replicas is independent of prefactors in ( [ eq : taur ] ) , we can obtain @xmath47 by numerically minimizing the rhs of ( [ eq : taur ] ) with respect to @xmath3 , the result is @xmath48    the above result represents the main strength of replica exchange monte carlo . the time for barrier",
    "crossing between the wells has been reduced from an exponential in the barrier height to linear in the barrier height .",
    "note that a key feature of the double well model required for the success of parallel tempering is the continuity of the free energy with temperature .      when @xmath49 , the wells are asymmetric and the motion of replicas is biased diffusion .",
    "replicas in the deep well move toward lower temperatures relative to replicas in the shallow well .",
    "the average replica exchange rates reflect that bias and , carrying out the integrals in ( [ eq : r ] ) , we obtain @xmath50 and @xmath51 where @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 since @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we have @xmath57 and the dynamics is biased toward deep well replicas moving to lower temperatures .",
    "the velocity @xmath58 of deep well ( shallow well ) replicas toward lower ( higher ) temperature is the difference of the rates , @xmath59 figure [ fig : vel ] shows @xmath60 vs @xmath61 for several values of @xmath19 and the choice @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the three curves correspond to @xmath65 ( bottom ) , @xmath66 ( middle ) and @xmath67 ( top ) .",
    "the qualitative features are that velocity increases as the bias , @xmath19 increases and that @xmath68 must neither be too large and nor too near zero to maximize the velocity . as the bias increases , the velocity approaches unity for an increasing range of @xmath68 .     vs.  the temperature between the replicas @xmath61 for three values of the well asymmetry parameter , @xmath65 ( blue , bottom ) , 5 ( green , middle ) and 20 ( red , top ) for the choice @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "]    as @xmath19 increases there is a complicated crossover from diffusion to biased diffusion to ballistic motion . unlike the symmetric case , for @xmath49 the arguments of the error functions depend on both the temperature difference between replicas and the absolute temperature so that evenly spaced replicas can not be expected to optimize the equilibration time",
    "nonetheless , we can make some crude estimates for the ballistic regime .",
    "the requirement for the ballistic regime is that @xmath69 for most replica temperatures @xmath4 so that each replica is nearly always in the deep well .",
    "then @xmath70 can be chosen so that @xmath71 . in this regime",
    "the equilibration time scale is simply the time required to generate order @xmath3 states in the deep well at @xmath26 and then move them to the colder replicas .",
    "this time scale is order @xmath3 .",
    "the argument of the error function must be small to achieve a velocity near unity , which is essentially the same condition as in the diffusive regime to that @xmath44 .",
    "the behavior of the equilibration time in the ballistic regime @xmath72 is expected to be @xmath73 the main point here is that the time scale is much longer for the diffusive regime than the ballistic regime . in the diffusive regime ,",
    "the equilibration time is proportional to the free energy barrier between the wells but in the ballistic regime it behaves as the square root of the free energy barrier .",
    "we have so far considered the simple situation where the free energy difference between the wells changes monotonically with the temperature  one well is the deeper than the other for all @xmath74 .",
    "if instead , the free energy difference between wells changes sign in a temperature region where there is a large barrier between the wells then the motion of replicas will be biased in a way that causes trapping and very long equilibration times .",
    "this is the situation that holds at a thermal first - order transition",
    ". it would be interesting to calculate the equilibration times in a simple free energy landscape with a first - order transition .",
    "we carried out simulations of parallel tempering for the double well model . in each step of the simulation ,",
    "a pair of adjacent temperatures @xmath4 and @xmath5 is randomly chosen .",
    "the energies of the associated replicas are chosen from normal distributions with means @xmath14 and @xmath75 and standard deviations @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "the replica exchange move is accepted with probability given by ( [ eq : reprob ] ) .",
    "if one of the replicas is at @xmath26 , the well indicator @xmath10 for this replica is chosen randomly before attempting the replica exchange move .",
    "otherwise , transitions between the two wells are forbidden and @xmath10 is conserved .",
    "one mc sweep consists of @xmath78 replica exchange attempts and time is measured in sweeps .",
    "the simulations are initialized so that each replica is randomly chosen to be in either well with equal probability .",
    "we simulated several values of the parameters @xmath19 , @xmath79 , and @xmath3 .",
    "in all simulations we chose @xmath80 and @xmath64 so as to be deep in the low temperature regime .",
    "we measured two quantities , the exponential autocorrelation time and the initial decay toward equilibrium .",
    "the exponential autocorrelation time @xmath81 is obtained from the autocorrelation function , @xmath82 of the fraction of replicas in the deep well @xmath83 , @xmath84 here @xmath85 indicates an equilibrium average and the measurement of @xmath86 is displaced by @xmath87 sweeps from @xmath88 .",
    "the equilibrium average is obtained from long time averages .",
    "the initialization time before data collection is typically several thousand sweeps and the run time is 10 to 50 million sweeps . except for an initial period of faster decay , @xmath82 is well described by a single exponential and the exponential autocorrelation time @xmath81 is obtained by fitting to a single exponential function , @xmath89 over an appropriate range of @xmath87 .",

    "the initial short time scale for @xmath98 for the strongly asymmetric @xmath66 case can be understood qualitatively as the average time for the lowest temperature replica that is also in the deep well to move to the lowest temperature @xmath38 .",

    "thus we expect that initially , @xmath98 will decay on a time scale order unity .",
    "since this initial decay persists to quite small values of @xmath98 it may be the relevant time scale for practical equilibration in the strongly asymmetric case .",

    "the golf course system is a quenched disordered system ; different realizations of disorder correspond to different sets of ground states .",
    "the microstates of the system are labeled by integers and we suppose that there is an oracle for each realization of the system that tells whether a given integer label corresponds to a ground state . on the other hand ,",
    "the set of ground states is itself inaccessible except by exhaustive search .",
    "natural realizations of golf course landscapes are studied in @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 is also the inverse temperature of a pseudo - first - order transition . for @xmath113 and large @xmath109",
    "the system is almost surely in a ground state but for @xmath114 it is almost surely in an excited state .",
    "more specifically , let @xmath22 be the probability of being in a ground state at temperature @xmath4 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that @xmath22 is given by @xmath115    the dynamics of the system is a global version of the metropolis - hastings algorithm .",
    "each step consists of proposing a random microstate , consulting the oracle to determine its energy and then accepting the proposal with probability , @xmath116 $ ] where @xmath117 is the difference in energy between the proposed and initial microstate .",
    "this dynamics converges to equilibrium , however , the equilibration time is exponential in @xmath109 . in units of mc steps , the excitation rate from a ground state to an excited state",
    "is controlled by the energy barrier @xmath118 .",
    "the de - excitation rate from an excited state to a ground state is controlled by the entropy barrier is @xmath119 .",
    "the equilibration rate is the sum of these two rates , @xmath120 . for @xmath121 the equilibration rate",
    "is dominated by the de - excitation term and the equilibration time @xmath122 is approximately , @xmath123 on the other hand , for @xmath124 , the equilibration rate is dominated by the excitation rate and the equilibration time @xmath125 is @xmath126    suppose we wish to equilibrate a system at inverse temperature @xmath127 using replica exchange monte carlo with replicas given by ( [ eq : repbb ] ) with @xmath128 .",
    "initially each replica is almost certainly in an excited state .",
    "since all replicas have the same energy , replica exchange moves are always accepted and the round trip time is independent of @xmath109 though proportional to @xmath129 .",
    "of course , this short initial round trip time is misleading and has nothing to do with the equilibration time .",
    "equilibration requires finding ground states and this happens on the exponential time scale @xmath122 .",
    "if a ground state is discovered by a high temperature replica , that ground state will quickly and nearly irreversibly be passed to lower temperature by replica exchange . if there are @xmath130 replica temperatures in the low temperature ` phase , ' that is , if @xmath131 and @xmath132 then a ground state must be discovered @xmath130 times to populate each cold replica . since there are @xmath3 systems looking for the ground state , we obtain a modest acceleration of order @xmath133 . for example , if @xmath134 , there is a factor of @xmath3 speed - up due to replica exchange .",
    "this speed - up is not dependent on faster equilibration at high temperatures but relies on simple parallelism ; all replicas are put to work independently looking for rare ground states but only @xmath130 ground states need to be found . in conclusion , for the golf course landscape , replica exchange achieves a modest speed - up in the equilibration time due to brute force parallelism .",
    "before equilibration has been achieved , the round - trip time is short and unrelated to the equilibration time .",
    "the golf course landscape is the most extreme case of the problem of the equilibrium macrostate having an exponentially small and hidden basin of attraction .",
    "the broad conclusion of this work is that replica exchange monte carlo is efficient for systems with free energy landscapes with multiple minima so long as the landscape varies continuously and monotonically with temperature and the relevant minima have large basins of attraction . in this situation ,",
    "replica exchange is able to quickly sample the minima with the correct weighting . in this context ,",
    "a basin of attraction of a macrostate is imprecisely defined as the subset of microstates that has a high likelihood of reaching the macrostate via a quench from high temperature .",
    "the speed of the quench must be much slower than the rate of equilibration within the macrostate and much faster than the transition rate between macrostates . given the assumption of large basins of attraction and exponential barriers between macrostates , parallel tempering with polynomially many replicas reaches equilibrium in a time that is polynomial in the barrier height and thus achieves exponential speed - up . on the other hand ,",
    "replica exchange yields little improvement for systems where the relevant macrostates states have small basins of attraction . here",
    "the problem is simply finding equilibrium states rather than moving between them . for real world applications",
    ", both kinds of problems may be present ",
    "barriers between multiple states and small basins of attraction .",

    "it is is known that finding ground states is np - hard  @xcite .",
    "this fact suggest , but does not prove , that the basins of attraction of the low temperature equilibrium states are exponentially small . on the other hand , for temperatures not too far below the critical temperature it may be that the basins of attraction are still relatively large and replica exchange can produce large reductions in equilibration times .    as a working hypothesis ,",
    "let us adopt the droplet picture  @xcite for the low temperature phase of the three - dimensional ising spin glass .",
    "within the droplet picture something like the double well model should describe the lowest lying states in the low temperature phase .",
    "the two wells correspond to the two orientations of the droplet and fluctuations around these orientations .",
    "each realization of disorder has different values of the barrier height and free energy difference .",
    "the statistics of these parameters are assumed to have power law behavior in the linear systems size @xmath135 .",
    "specifically , @xmath136 and @xmath137 where the overbar refers to a disorder average and @xmath138 is believed to be near 0.2 for the three - dimensional ising spin glass .",
    "parallel tempering has proved to be a successful tool for studying 3d spin glasses and it is reasonable to assume that for small systems the equilibrium states have sufficiently large basins of attraction that they can be  found \" in a reasonable time by replica exchange .",
    "even so , there is a potential source of bias in parallel tempering as it is typically used . in typical applications",
    "the length of the run is fixed independent of the realization of disorder .",
    "these parameters are chosen to insure that some disorder averages are near their equilibrium values .",
    "for example , the test described in @xcite insures that the disorder averaged energy is near its equilibrium value .",
    "however , this requirement may not guarantee that all relevant observables are well equilibrated .    in the droplet model ,",
    "the fraction of realizations with nearly degenerate lowest lying states scales as @xmath139 .",
    "thus most disorder realizations have a large free energy difference between the equilibrium state and the excited ( droplet ) state . in the context of the double well model ,",
    "these realizations have @xmath140 and , as we have seen , they will be rapidly equilibrated by parallel tempering . on the other hand , the small fraction ( order @xmath139 ) of realizations with ` active droplets ,",
    "' that is , two nearly degenerate minima , will have much longer than typical equilibration times . both because these realizations are rare and because the two droplet orientations have similar energies , the poor equilibration of these active droplet realizations will not introduce much error in the measurement of the disorder averaged energy .",
    "the same can not be said for the disorder averaged spin overlap distribution near zero overlap , @xmath141 .",
    "it is precisely the difficult to equilibrate , active droplet realizations that contribute to this quantity since these are the systems that have a significant likelihood in equilibrium of having either droplet orientation .",
    "if these realizations are not equilibrated it will lead to an overestimate of @xmath141 .",
    "in particular , the equilibrium contribution of a given realization to @xmath141 depends on the relative weight of the two droplet states .",
    "given the simplifying assumption that the two droplet states have zero overlap , a realization with free energy difference @xmath18 between the droplet states will contribute @xmath142 to @xmath141 .",
    "exactly degenerate disorder realizations contribute @xmath143 to @xmath141 but as @xmath144 becomes larger than unity , the equilibrium contribution to @xmath141 diminishes rapidly .",
    "however , for times less than the equilibration time the two droplet orientations will be close to equally populated assuming both have nearly equal basins of attraction as expected in the droplet model .",
    "the result of this bias is that , @xmath141 approaches its equilibrium value _ from above _ on a time scale associated with the equilibration of realizations with active droplets .",
    "this time scale is expected to be considerably longer than the time scale for the equilibration of the disorder averaged energy .",
    "the nature of the low temperature phase of finite - dimensional spin glasses is the subject of a long standing controversy . in the droplet scenario",
    "most realizations of disorder have a large gap between a unique equilibrium state and a macroscopically different low lying excited state .",
    "the replica symmetry breaking picture  @xcite proposes multiple nearly degenerate low lying equilibrium states with an ultrametric overlap structure .",
    "a scenario that has features of both pictures and is supported by numerical studies is the ` trivial non - trivial ' ( tnt ) picture  @xcite .",
