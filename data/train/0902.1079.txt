    "the quantum inverse scattering method ( qism ) @xcite provides a powerful framework for the construction of exactly solvable lattice models with the yang - baxter equation defining the underlying algebraic structure .",

    "the eigenvalues are encoded into the solutions to certain functional relations which have to be solved in a second step : using the analytical properties of the transfer matrix its eigenvalues can be parametrized in terms of the roots of bethe equations .    recently",
    ", such alternative routes to the solution of the spectral problem of exactly solvable models have been applied to anisotropic spin chains with open ends and general non - diagonal boundary fields . here",
    ", the boundary fields break particle number conservation and therefore the completely polarized state of spins can not be used as a pseudo vacuum for the algebraic bethe ansatz .",

    "some of these methods require restrictions on the boundary fields and/or the bulk anisotropy of the spin chain to work , other approaches rely on conjectures regarding the existence of certain limits .",
    "depending on the specific approach one obtains very different functional equations for the spectral problem and in many cases an efficient procedure for their solution is still missing .    in this paper we consider some of these approaches in a simpler setting to better understand how they are related and to assess their applicability for the solution of the spectral problem : the xxz model with general toroidal boundary conditions is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath0\\ , , \\qquad    \\sigma^\\alpha_{l+1}=k^{-1 } \\sigma^\\alpha_1 k\\ ] ] where @xmath1 , @xmath2 denote the pauli matrices for spins",
