    "quark - gluon are color charged particles .",
    "the dominant interaction among quarks and gluons are strong(color ) interaction .",
    "color interactions are analogous to electromagnetic interactions .",
    "color charge particles produce chromoelectric field .",
    "therefore chromomagnetic field will also be produced due to the motion of colored particles .",
    "effect of chromomagnetism was earlier studied by rujula , georgi , and glashow to explain mass splitting of hadron spectrum @xcite . in this work",
    "they also predicted the existence of new states of hadrons with charm quarks and the mass of charm quarks .",
    "chromomagnetism was also found useful to explain decay as well as production mechanisms of many hadrons @xcite . in these works",
    "various kind of chromomagnetic forces were found and were supported by experimental results .    in a separate work sapirstein examined the quark color magnetic moment in the framework of a quark with a constant external color magnetic field @xcite .",
    "ninomiya and sakai studied the chromomagnetism to understand the phase transitions in quantum chromodynamics(qcd ) @xcite .",
    "kapusta has studied the phase transition in a system of gluons interacting with a constant color magnetic field @xcite .",
    "therefore we find that chromomagnetism has played a vital role in explaining some complicated problems of qcd .",
    "color charge on quarks and gluons are responsible for strong or non - abelian interactions . because of color charges they may produce chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields .",
    "the chromoelectrodynamics of these particles is governed by the yang - mills equations which are analogs of the maxwell s equations . as we know",
    "that hadrons are color neutral particles but with the help of string model we have proved that hadrons can have color magnetic moment .",
    "because of color magnetic moment hadrons may show color interactions .",
    "in section two we have calculated the color magnetic moments of mesons and baryons separately .",
    "then we have calculated the partition function . with the help of partition function",
    "we have studied the chromomagnetic properties of nuclear matter and possibilities of phase transition .",
    "quarks and gluons are color charged particles . due to color charge and their motion they can produce chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields . in this paper",
    "we have discussed only quarks contribution in chromomagnetism .",
    "gluonic contributions will be discussed later in some other work .",
    "hadrons are color neutral particles but they can have color magnetic moment like a neutron , which is electrically neutral particle but it has non - zero magnetic moment .",
    "therefore hadrons can have color interaction due to their color magnetic moment .",
    "hence we have first estimated the chromomagnetic moment of hadrons .",
    "we have done the formulation in the framework of the string model of hadrons . according to this quark(or antiquark )",
    "are attached at the ends of the string .",
    "the string rotates about its center of mass . due to rotation color currents",
    "are generated .",
    "these color currents are of two type : ( i ) abelian , and ( ii ) non - abelian .",
    "the abelian current is generated due to the orbital motion of quarks and non - abelian current is generated due to the temporal variation of color charge which is well described by the wong equation @xcite .",
    "the wong s equation is written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the gauge potential , and @xmath2 is the structure constant of the gauge group , @xmath3 is the color charge of a quark , and @xmath4 is the color index .",
    "@xmath5 are four velocity vectors given by @xmath6 .",
    "it should be noted that in eq[wo ] the derivative is _ wrt _",
    "@xmath7(proper time ) not _ wrt _ ` @xmath8 '",
    ". therefore the color current produced by a quark / antiquark is given by @xmath9 with the help of wong equation the color current is obtained as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the angular velocity of quarks and @xmath12 is the relativistic factor . due to these currents",
    "hadrons have intrinsic color magnetic moments .",
    "we have divided our analysis into two parts : ( i ) mesons @xmath13 ( ii ) baryons .",
    "a meson contains quark and antiquark pair at the end of flux string ( see fig a ) . let us consider a general case of meson which contains two different kinds of quark - antiquark . due to color neutrality of meson quark - antiquark pair will have equal and opposite color charges .",
    "the orbital color magnetic moment(@xmath14 ) associated with quark @xmath15 is given by @xmath16\\frac{\\pi l^2m_2 ^ 2}{(m_1+m_2)^2}\\hat{n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 , @xmath17 are color charge and mass of quark @xmath15 , @xmath18 are gauge fields at @xmath19 .",
    "it is assumed that the quark @xmath20 is situated at location @xmath19 @xmath21 center of mass of meson .",
    "@xmath2 is the structure constant of su(3 ) group .",
    "@xmath22 is the mass of antiquark @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is the string length and @xmath11 is the orbital angular velocity of quark .",
    "@xmath25 is the unit vector in the direction of the area sweep out by the rotational motion of string .",
    "similarly we can calculate the orbital color magnetic moment of antiquark @xmath23 .",
    "the net color magnetic moment of a meson is obtained by summing up the color magnetic moments produced by quark as well as antiquark .",
    "therefore the net color magnetic moment of a meson is given by @xmath26\\frac{\\pi l^2}{(m_2+m_1)^2}\\hat{n }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    according to eq[meson ] the color magnetic moment of a meson will have abelian as well as non - abelian components .",
    "both abelian and non - abelian components are functions of masses of quarks . for a meson with same kind of quark / antiquark ( like @xmath27 , @xmath28 etc ) the abelian component of color magnetic moment will be zero .",
    "a baryon consists of three quarks ( say @xmath29 ) . it can have three possible configurations described by fig 1 .",
    "b , c,@xmath13 d. on repeating the analysis of mesons we calculate the color magnetic moments of all these configurations .",
    "the color magnetic moment for configuration decribed in fig1.b is given by @xmath30\\frac{\\pi l^2}{(m_1+m_2+m_3)^2}\\hat{n } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    similarly color magnetic moments for other two possible configurations can be calculated .",
    "all these configurations are equally probable",
    ". their average will be the color magnetic moment of a baryon .",
    "therefore the color magnetic moment of a baryon is given by @xmath31\\hat{n}+\\left[[f^{abc}q^b_1\\{a^c_o(\\vec{r}_1)-\\vec{v}_1\\cdot\\vec{a}^c(\\vec{r}_1)\\}(m_2+m_3)^2\\right .",

    "let us consider a sample of nuclear matter where hadrons ( irrespective of baryon or meson ) do not interact among themselves . to study the thermodynamic properties we first calculate the partition function .",
    "the partition function for such system is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the non - magnetic energy associated with a hadron , @xmath34 is the temperature inverse of hadronic system , and @xmath35 is the external color magnetic field acting on the nuclear matter .",
    "therefore the mean color magnetisation ( color magnetic moment per unit volume ) , @xmath36 , of a hadronic medium is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is number density of hadron for a stable nuclear matter but for unstable quark matter like quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) there will be continuous production of hadrons then @xmath38 will indicate hadron production rate and obviously @xmath36 will show the rate of change of magnetization of hadronic matter",
    ".    at very large temperature @xmath39 on following the works of karsch @xcite and huang and lissia @xcite one can show @xmath40\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for three quark flavors . in eq[hua",
    "] @xmath41 is the qcd phase transition temperature . in other words",
    "the color charge of a quark is a temperature dependent quantity .",
    "therefore from equations [ meson],[baryon ] , [ charge],and [ hua ] it is clear that the color magnetism of hadronic matter does not follow the curie law . due to the presence of non - linear temeprature dependence and non - abelian component of color",
    "magnetic moment it will show complicated behavior .",
    "so far we have studied chromomagnetism produced by quarks only . however hadrons are color neutral particles .",
    "but they may have non - zero chromomagnetic moment .",
    "due to this chromomagnetic moment they will show color interactions among each other . due to the non - abelian nature of strong interactions",
    "there are two components of chromomagnetic moment of hadrons : ( i ) abelian and ( ii ) non - abelian .",
    "this may cause the existence of different chromomagnetic phases of nuclear matter . from the analysis for a non - interacting hadronic system we have seen that chromomagnetism of hadronic matter does not follow the curie law .",
