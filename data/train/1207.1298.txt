    "entanglement has been widely investigated in the last years @xcite , and is a resource that allows for tasks that can not be performed classically , as teleportation @xcite , quantum key distribution @xcite , superdense coding @xcite , and speed - up of some algorithms @xcite , just to cite a few examples .",
    "therefore entanglement is an indisputable signature of the non - classicallity of a state .",
    "nevertheless , some authors have argued that there is more to the _ quantumness _ of a state than just its entanglement @xcite .",
    "this notion of quantumness beyond entanglement is captured by the _ quantum discord _ , which is defined as all the correlations contained in a state but the classical ones @xcite , or as a measure of disturbance of a state after local measurements @xcite , both definitions being compatible with a class of separable states with non - null quantum discord .",
    "recent investigations suggest that quantum discord can be considered a resource that gives a quantum advantage @xcite . in order to deepen our understanding of both the usefulness of such a resource and how _ quantum",
    "_ it really is , it is important to devise operational means to quantify it , and also to relate it to quantum entanglement . in this respect ,",
    "the _ geometric discord _",
    "@xcite defined as the distance between the state of interest and a properly defined _ classical _ state is an invaluable tool .",
    "unhappily the _ classical states _ do not form a convex set @xcite , and therefore one can not use the well known separating hyperplane theorem to characterize discord as is done with the witness operators in the case of the entanglement problem @xcite .",
    "interesting investigations relating entanglement and discord have been done recently @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "entanglement of formation is related to discord in a conservation equation , and in @xcite geometric discord is conjectured to be bounded by the negativity .",
    "while entanglement of formation is not computable in general , many other interesting entanglement quantifiers can be expressed in terms of optimal entanglement witnesses @xcite which , by its turn , can be calculated numerically by means of efficient semidefinite programs @xcite . in this work",
    "we will explore bounds for geometric discord by means of optimal entanglement witnesses .",
    "in particular , we will prove that negativity bounds the geometric discord .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we briefly revise quantum discord , and propose a redefinition of geometric discord using the schatten @xmath0-norm . in sec.iii , we recall the _ witnessed entanglement _ , with special attention to both negativity and robustness . in sec.iv , we derive bounds for geometric discord using witnessed entanglement . in sec.v , we illustrate our results for werner states and some families of bound entangled states .",
    "we conclude in sec.vi .",
    "the total amount of correlations of a bipartite system @xmath1 is quantified by the well known mutual information , which in the classical case can be written in two equivalent forms linked by bayes rule , namely : @xmath2 , being @xmath3 the shanon entropy of @xmath4 and @xmath5 the conditional entropy of @xmath4 given @xmath6 . for a quantum system @xmath7 , the mutual information is defined in terms of the von neuman",
    "entropy @xmath8 , and reads : @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the marginals of @xmath7 .",
    "however , the definition of a quantum _ conditional entropy _ is dependent on the choice of a given povm @xmath12 to be measured on party b , and the two expressions for the mutual information are no longer equivalent . while eq.[iab ] still quantifies the total amount of correlations in the quantum state , the other expression involving the conditional entropy needs some attention .",
    "after the measurement of @xmath13 on @xmath14 , party @xmath15 is left in the state @xmath16 , with probability @xmath17 .",
    "now we can write the conditional entropy associated to the povm @xmath12 as : @xmath18 @xmath19 quantifies the classical correlations contained in @xmath7 under measurements in the given povm .",
    "therefore , maximizing @xmath20 over all povms quantifies the classical correlations in the quantum state , namely @xcite : @xmath21 where the povms can be chosen to be rank - one @xcite . finally , the _ quantum discord _ is the disagreement between the nonequivalent expressions of mutual information in the quantum case , namely @xcite : @xmath22 note that @xmath23 is non - negative and asymmetric with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "as discord is supposed to measure the quantumness of a state , it is no wonder that the maximally entangled states eq.[maxent ] are the most discordant , while states which are a mere encoding of classical probability distributions eq.[cc ] are concordant ( i.e. @xmath25 ) @xcite .",
    "bipartite maximally entangled states in @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , have the form : @xmath28 while _ classical states _ can be written as : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are two orthonormal bases .",
    "note however , that as discord is asymmetric , if the measurements are to be done in subsystem @xmath14 , the following class of states are also concordant or classical : @xmath32 to distinguish these two classes of classical states , sometimes the former is referred to as _ classical - classical _ , while the later is _ quantum - classical_.    an alternative definition for quantum discord is based on the distance between the given quantum state and the closest classical state @xcite . adopting the hilbert - schmidt norm @xmath33 , we can write @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the set of zero - discord states .",
    "this measure can be interpreted as the minimal disturbance after local measurements on subsystem @xmath14 . in this case",
    "@xmath35 contains the states in eq.[qc ] , and @xmath36 can be calculated analytically for some states @xcite .",
    "consider the schatten @xmath0-norm for some matrix @xmath15 and positive integer @xmath0 : @xmath37\\}^{1/p},\\ ] ] which , for @xmath38 is the hilbert - schmidt norm .",
    "in finite hilbert spaces , these norms induce the same ordering @xcite . therefore we propose to extend the geometric discord for any @xmath0-norm , namely : @xmath39 note that for @xmath40 , we have @xmath41 .",
    "it follows that the 1-norm is the most distinguishable distance in hilbert space .",
    "therefore , we shall investigate the geometric discord in the 1-norm ( @xmath42 ) , besides the usual @xmath36 . as we shall see , it is easy to bound these geometric discords by entanglement witnesses .",
    "entanglement witnesses are hermitian operators ( observables - @xmath43 ) whose expectation values contain information about the entanglement of quantum states .",
    "the operator @xmath43 is an entanglement witness for a given entangled quantum state @xmath44 if the following conditions are satisfied @xcite : its expectation value is negative for the particular entangled quantum state ( @xmath45 ) , while it is non - negative on the set of separable states ( @xmath46 ) ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "we are particularly interested in optimal entanglement witnesses .",
    "_ @xmath48 _ is the oew for the state @xmath44 if @xmath49 where @xmath50 represents a compact subset of the set of entanglement witnesses @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "oews can be used to quantify entanglement .",
    "such quantification is related to the choice of the set @xmath50 , where different sets will determine different quantifiers @xcite .",
    "we can define these quantifiers by : @xmath52    an example of a quantifier that can be calculated using oews is the generalized robustness of entanglement @xcite ( @xmath53 ) , which is defined as the minimum required mixture such that a separable state is obtained . precisely , it is the minimum value of @xmath54 such that @xmath55 be a separable state , where @xmath56 can be any state .",
    "we know that the generalized robustness can be calculated from eq.[oew ] , using @xmath57 @xcite , where @xmath58 is the identity operator ; in other words , @xmath59 a particular case of the generalized robustness is the random robustness , where @xmath56 in eq.[gr ] is taken to be the maximally mixed state ( @xmath60 ) . in this case , the compact set of entanglement witnesses is @xmath61 .",
    "the random robustness @xmath62 quantifies the resilience of the entanglement to white noise , and is given by @xcite : @xmath63    the well known negativity for bipartite states , which is the sum of the negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose of the given state , @xmath64 , can also be expressed in terms of oews as @xcite : @xmath65    the construction of entanglement witnesses is a hard problem . in an interesting method proposed by brando and vianna @xcite , the optimization of entanglement witnesses is cast as a _ robust semidefinite program _ ( rsdp ) . despite rsdp",
    "is computationally intractable , it is possible to perform a probabilistic relaxation turning it into a semidefinite program(sdp ) , which can be solved efficiently @xcite .",
    "in this section we show that geometric discord , in any norm , is lower bounded by entanglement .",
    "in particular , we show that norm-2 geometric discord is bounded by negativity , but the relation is slightly different from that conjectured by girolami and adesso [ 12 ] .",
    "for any two operators @xmath15,@xmath14@xmath66 and the schatten @xmath0-norm @xmath67^{1/p}$ ] , the following inequality holds : @xmath68|,\\ ] ] where @xmath69 .",
    "the geometrical discord for a state @xmath70 is : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the closest non - discordant state .",
    "the witnessed entanglement of @xmath44 can be written as : @xmath73 \\},\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the optimal entanglement witness of @xmath44 .",
    "plugging @xmath75 and @xmath76 in eq.[sec4.1 ] , we get : @xmath77|.\\ ] ] if @xmath44 is entangled and @xmath72 is separable we have @xmath78|\\geq|tr[\\rho w_{\\rho}]|$ ] , thus : @xmath79| } { \\vert w_{\\rho } \\vert_{q}},\\ ] ] which in terms of geometric discord ( eq.2 ) reads : @xmath80 therefore , given any entanglement witness ( it does not need to be optimal ) , we have a bound for geometric discord in any norm .",
    "note that eq.6 is also valid for multipartite states . for norm-1 and norm-2 ,",
    "eq.6 reduces to : @xmath81    @xmath82}.\\ ] ]    if @xmath83 is the entanglement witness for the negativity , @xmath84 ( see eq.[sec4.3 ] ) , then @xmath85   = n_{-}$ ] , where @xmath86 is the number of negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose of @xmath44 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "thus , in norm-2 , discord is lower bounded by negativity as : @xmath88 where @xmath89 ( remember @xmath90 ) . for norm-1 discord",
    ", one has to calculate @xmath91 , which is simply the largest eigenvalue of @xmath83 in absolute value , and use eq.[sec4.7 ] .",
    "note that it is easy .",
    "one has just to form a rank-@xmath86 projector with the eigenstates or @xmath87 associated to the @xmath86 negative eigenvalues , then @xmath83 is the partial transpose of this projector .",
    "in this section we illustrate our results with numerical calculations on maximally entangled pure staes , werner states and bound entangled states .",
    "we consider the negativity and random robustness .",
    "werner states ( @xmath92 ) @xcite , which are of the bell diagonal type , can be written as : @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "the parameter @xmath95 is in the interval @xmath96 $ ] , and the state is entangled for @xmath97 .    in ( fig.[f1 ] ) we compare negativity , random robustness and 1-norm geometric discord . note that negativity and random robustness coincide in the entangled region and are always less than the discord .",
    "note also that the random robustness in the non - entangled region ( @xmath98 ) has a functional behavior similar to the discord .      bound entangled states",
    "have positive partial transpose ( @xmath99 ) and are known to be undistillable @xcite .",
    "the negativity is useless in this case , but the random robustness can give an interesting bound for the discord .      consider a hilbert space @xmath100 , and a canonical orthonormal basis @xmath101 .",
    "take the following three states @xcite : @xmath102,\\ ] ] @xmath103\\ ] ] and @xmath104,\\ ] ] where @xmath105 .",
    "the following convex combination is a @xmath99-entangled state for @xmath106 , and is separable for @xmath107 : @xmath108 + \\frac{1}{8k+1 } { | \\phi_{k } \\rangle \\langle \\phi_{k } |}.\\ ] ] note , in fig.2a , that the most discordant state of this family is the less entangled one , and vice - versa .",
    "however , it is not a general characteristic of bound entangled states , as can be seen in the next example ( fig.2b ) .      in a bipartite hilbert space @xmath109 ,",
    "an orthogonal product basis ( pb ) is an @xmath110-dimensional set of separable states spanning a subspace @xmath111 of @xmath112 .",
    "when the complement of this pb in @xmath112 has only entangled states , we say that the complete basis containing pb is a unextendible product basis ( upb ) @xcite .",
    "consider the following three classes of vectors in @xmath113 : @xmath114 now define the following vectors : @xmath115 for @xmath116 , @xmath117 for @xmath118 , and @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "finally , a @xmath99-entangled state is given by : @xmath121 in ( fig.2b ) , we plotted random robustness and 1-norm geometric discord for the convex mixture : @xmath122 which is separable for @xmath123 .",
    "we see that the discord is always greater than the entanglement , and the most discordant states are also the most entangled .      in tabs .",
    "i and ii , we compare the bounds for norm-1 and norm-2 in two maximally entangled states , an @xmath124 werner state , and a @xmath125 mixed state whose density matrix coincides with the @xmath124 werner state .",
    "the norm-1 bounds are much better than the norm-2 ones .",

    "many known measures of entanglement can be expressed by optimal ews , which implies that our bounds are quite general .",
