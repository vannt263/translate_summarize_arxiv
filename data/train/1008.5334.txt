    "we repeated this procedure for different values of the ratio @xmath98 and , for each value of @xmath99 , we reconstructed the experimental @xmath8 matrix of the process .",

    "we determined the fidelity between the experimental map and the ideal one for several values of @xmath99 , as shown in fig .",

    "we observe that @xmath110 for each value of @xmath99 ( by construction ) , while the other eigenvalue , @xmath109 , shows a decreasing behaviour as the ratio between the trasmittivities decreases , as expected from ( [ p ] ) .",
    "again , a very good agreement between experimental data and theory is obtained .",
    "the method above described can be usefully adopted even when the process under investigation is ideally trace - preserving .",
    "in fact , when a quantum process tomography is practically implemented , any interaction with the environment as well as experimental imperfections may cause the process to be non trace - preserving . in practice , to approximate the process as a trace - preserving one corresponds to minimize the likelihood function ( [ lhood ] ) with the additional constraint @xmath111 . in this way we are imposing the probability of success to be independent of the input state .",
    "we carried out the @xmath112 minimization by taking into account the constraint of the mathematica5 program that allows to numerically minimizes @xmath112 subject to the constraints cons .",
    "note that the constraint imposes the normalization tr@xmath114=1 $ ] . ] and evaluated the process fidelity between the obtained @xmath89 and the ideal matrix ( [ chimat ] ) for each value of @xmath99 .",

    "[ fidvinc ] .",
    "( red open circles ) .",
    "fidelities obtained with the previous method are also reported ( black filled triangles ) . ]",
    "as expected , this method gives results similar to those obtained in section iiia for @xmath115 , while the fidelities values are different as @xmath99 decreases .",
    "in particular , the fidelities calculated by imposing the constraint decrease as @xmath99 goes to zero . it is evident that constraining the process to be trace - preserving does not allow to correctly reconstruct the associated map .",
    "a further scenario where probability of success must be taken into account may arise when measurements are performed in post - selection .",
    "the reconstruction of the output state density matrices ( which obviously are normalized physical states ) for several input state , leads to a trace - preserving process .",
    "even in this case we evaluated the fidelities between the resulting process matrix and the ideal one obtaining the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fidnorm ] . as in the previous case",
    "the fidelity decreases as @xmath99 goes to zero .",
    "note that this approach is not correct even from a theoretical point of view : the process matrix @xmath20 obtained by normalizing the output states could be non - physical ( i.e. it could have negative eigenvalues ) and its expression depends on the chosen set of input states .",
    "this is due to the fact that normalization implies the process to be no longer a linear map and equation ( [ e2 ] ) is not valid anymore . in general",
    ", the output state normalization produces wrong process matrices for _ any _ non trace - preserving operation with state dependent success probability .",
    "a review on quantum process tomography of non trace - preserving maps has been reported .",
    "the experimental implementation of a simple non trace - preserving , state dependent process , i.e. the transformation induced by a partially polarizing beam splitter , provided process fidelities larger than @xmath116 for any value of the ratio between the transmittivities @xmath99 .",
    "particular attention has been addressed to the state dependence property of the process through evaluation of the operator @xmath0 ( [ pt ] ) .",
    "this operator has been calculated and measured in the case of a ppbs and its eigenvalues resulted to be different from unity ( see ( [ p ] ) ) , as expected for a non trace - preserving process . in order to stress the validity of the method a brief discussion about possible wrong approaches has been presented together with the explicit calculation of the ppbs process fidelities . the obtained results clearly show that approximation of a non trace - preserving , state dependent process with a trace - preserving one does not allow a correct reconstruction of the real process map .",
    "qpt of non trace preserving processes are relevant for linear optical logic gates with success probability @xmath117 .",
    "indeed , typically it is just assumed that the success probability of such gates is uniform across input states and hence it is crucial to check the validity of this assumption for any application .",
    "for example , it can be interesting to investigate whether losses in the planar integrated waveguide chips currently being used @xcite could affect different input states differently ."
