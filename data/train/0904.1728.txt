    "topological configurations of fields with the geometry of a string or a domain wall arise in various models either as solutions of classical field equations or as nonperturbative effective configurations of essentially quantum fields .",
    "string - like configurations are present in polymers , superconductors , in theoretical models of non - abelian dynamics , as well as in models of qcd confinement , and as topological defects in models with spontaneous breaking of gauge or global symmetries .",
    "metastable domain wall solutions arise in models with spontaneously broken approximate symmetry . the existence of such solutions was shown from different points of view , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "these configurations are classically stable , since there is no classical trajectory which takes from one topological solution into another with different topological number .",
    "but it may be the case that a classically forbidden trajectory for such a deformation exists so that the considered configurations are unstable quasiclassically and decay due to e.g. quantum tunneling effects . as an illustration of such decay process one can consider the example of a metastable domain wall investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite which arises in a model with a scalar field potential shown in fig.[potential ] .",
    "the domain wall solution corresponds to the interpolation between the same vacuum state at two spatial infinities , e.g. at @xmath0 and @xmath1 with the field winding around the ` peg ' in the potential .",
    "[ potential ]    such configuration is classically stable in the sense that the solution with certain winding number can not evolve classically to a solution with different topological number .",
    "however , such a transition can proceed either due to a thermal fluctuation , where the path , corresponding to the solution , is lifted over the barrier or due to quantum tunneling ( the motion in a classically forbidden region ) .",
    "the topological configurations can be metastable with respect to either a complete breaking , or a transition to an object of lower tension emerging instead of the initial one .",
    "the former situation is relevant e.g. for a break up of a qcd string with formation of a quark - antiquark pair , or a formation of a monopole - antimonopole pair@xcite , and also in a whole class of theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking@xcite .",
    "the latter situation involving a phase transition between states of a string with different tension is found e.g. in abelian higgs models embedded in non - abelian theories @xcite .",
    "a domain wall decay is analogous to the well - known spontaneous false vacuum decay process @xcite in @xmath2 dimensions . indeed ,",
    "if a hole of area @xmath3 is created in a wall with tension @xmath4 , the gain in the energy is @xmath5 .",
    "the barrier that inhibits the process is created by the energy @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being the perimeter of the hole and @xmath8 being a tension associated with the interface .",
    "thus , the ` area ' energy gain exceeds the barrier energy only starting from a critical size of the hole created , i.e. starting with a round hole of radius @xmath9 .",
    "once a critical bubble of the lower phase has nucleated due to tunneling , it expands , converting the domain wall .",
    "therefore the probability of the transition is given by the rate of nucleation of the critical holes in the domain wall .",
    "the same argument also applies to the string decay which is similar to a metastable vacuum decay process in @xmath10 dimensions .",
    "the critical size of the gap in the initial string is then @xmath11 .",
    "moreover due to the geometry of the problem such decay also bears a great similarity to the well known schwinger process of production of pair of charged particles by an external electromagnetic field @xcite .    despite the similarity with the false vacuum decay the breaking of the strings and walls involves an essential difference associated with the transverse waves propagating on the latter objects , corresponding to massless bosons , which in fact are the goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken translational invariance .",
    "the effect of the soft modes of the field of these bosons enters the probability of breaking the topological defects at the preexponential level  @xcite .",
    "the process of a metastable string transition from a state with tension @xmath12 to a state with tension @xmath13 was considered in @xcite . using the analogy with the false vacuum decay",
    "the decay rate was found with exponential accuracy in terms of the rate of nucleation of critical gaps per unit length of the string , @xmath14 there is no transverse motion for the string , and the preexponential factor can be also copied from the known result of spontaneous metastable vacuum decay @xmath15 ] , _ s = c ( - ^2 _",

    "namely , as long as the temperature @xmath23 is lower than the inverse of the critical length , @xmath24 the thermal effects in the latter processes are exponentially suppressed as @xmath25 with @xmath26 being the lowest scale for particle masses in the theory , and these effects are very small due to the strongly suppressed presence of massive particles in the thermal equilibrium@xcite . in the case of a string , however , the transverse waves on the string are massless so that their excitation has no suppression by the mass at arbitrarily low temperature .",
    "the thermal excitations of these waves create fluctuations in the distribution of the energy in the string which catalyze the nucleation of the critical gap .",
    "clearly , at @xmath27 the typical wavelength of the thermal waves @xmath28 is large in comparison with the critical length @xmath29 , and the thermal effect in the rate is quite small , although not exponentially small .",
    "the leading low temperature correction in the nucleation rate is given by the thermal catalysis factor@xcite _ s = 1 + ( d-2 ) ^8 450 ( _ 1-_2 3 _ 1-_2 ) ^2 ()^8 + o  , [ kf ] [ klow ] while as @xmath23 approaches @xmath30 , the catalysis factor develops a singularity at @xmath31 .",
    "at still higher temperatures the considered string transition behaves , in a sense , similarly to the false vacuum decay@xcite , namely the regime of the transition changes to a different tunneling trajectory , so that the temperature dependence appears in the semiclassical exponential factor in eq.([gf ] ) , rather than in the preexponential term .",
    "the effect of the thermally excited waves in the decay rate can in fact be considered  @xcite as an additional contribution to the probability of the decay due to collisions of the goldstone bosons that are present in the thermal bath . as it turns out , it is possible to identify in the thermal catalysis factor the contribution of individual such collisions and thus calculate the probability of the destruction of metastable string by colliding particles .",
    "in particular , the first temperature dependent term in the expansion ( [ klow ] ) is entirely due to the process of the critical gap creation in a collision of two particles in the limit , where their center of mass energy @xmath32 is much smaller than @xmath30 . in order to separate the terms in the decay probability originating from collisions of different number of the bosons , the standard thermal approach to calculating the decay rate at finite temperature  @xcite",
    "is modified  @xcite by formally introducing a negative chemical potential for the bosons .",
    "this allows to find the dependence of the probability of string destruction in an @xmath33-boson collision for an arbitrary relation between @xmath29 and the energy of the bosons .",
    "one of the results of such a consideration is that the string destruction takes place only in collisions of even number of bosons and is absent at odd @xmath33 .",
    "the explicit expression for the ( dimensionless ) probability @xmath34 of the critical gap creation in two - boson collisions at arbitrary values of the parameter @xmath35 has especially simple form for the decay of the string into ` nothing ' i.e. at @xmath36 : w_2=2 ^2 _ c^2 _ s ^2  , [ w20 ] with @xmath37 being the standard notation for the modified bessel function of the third order .",
    "this expression is applicable as long as the energy @xmath38 is small in comparison with the string energy scale : @xmath39 , which condition still allows for the parameter @xmath35 to be large . at @xmath40 the energy dependent factor in eq.([w20 ] )",
    "has the exponential behavior @xmath41 which matches the semiclassical approximation for the energy - dependent factor@xcite , corresponding to tunneling at the energy @xmath38 rather than at zero energy . in this sense",
    "the discussed energy dependence of the collision - induced probability of the decay describes the onset of the semiclassical behavior .",
    "one can also notice that the thermal factor @xmath42 , is singular  @xcite at @xmath43 .",
    "however the two - boson production rate does not exhibit any singularity at any value of the parameter @xmath44 , and a similar smooth energy behavior is also true for individual @xmath33-boson processes .",
    "thus the ` explosion ' of the thermal rate at @xmath43 is a result of infinite number of processes becoming important at this point , rather than due to a finite set of processes with a limited range of @xmath33 developing large probability at the energy per particle of the order of @xmath30 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to generalize to the case of a metastable domain wall the approach used for analyzing the thermal and collision induced effects in the decay of metastable strings .",
    "we find the general expression for the thermal catalysis factor @xmath45 .",
    "in particular , the leading term in this factor at low temperature ( in @xmath46 dimensions ) is given by _",
    "w = 1 + 12 ( d-3 ) ^ 2 ( 5 ) ( r _ w t ) ^ 10 +  .",

    ". we also aim at providing here a systematic and self - contained presentation of the calculations leading to our final results . to this end",
    "we recapitulate in detail in section 2 the technically simpler calculations for the processes with metastable strings , and then in section 3 expand the method to the case of a metastable domain wall .",
    "such ` semi - review ' format of the paper also allows us to illustrate the similarity and the difference between the string and the domain wall transitions .",
    "although the calculations in both cases are very much similar , the results differ in some essential details .",
    "in particular the destruction of a metastable wall is induced by a collision of any number of goldstone bosons , whereas a string can be destroyed by a collision of only even number of the bosons .",
    "another difference relates to the thermal catalysis of the decay : for a string the low temperature expansion for the enhancement of the quantum tunneling is applicable everywhere where the series is convergent , i.e. up to the temperature @xmath51 , while for a domain wall the thermal fluctuations start dominating@xcite at a lower temperature ( @xmath52 with @xmath53 being the diameter of the critical hole in the wall ) , at which the thermal effects in the quantum tunneling probability are still very small numerically .",
    "the tunneling trajectory can be described in the euclidean space by a configuration called the ` bounce'@xcite , which is a solution to ( euclidean ) classical equations of motion .",
    "the general expression for the effective euclidean space action for the string with the two considered phases can be written in the familiar nambu - goto form : s= p + _ 1 a_1 + _ 2 a_2  , [ a0 ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the areas of the world sheet for the two phases , and @xmath56 ( the perimeter ) is the length of the world line for the interface between them .",
    "[ fig2:bounce ]    the action ( [ a0 ] ) is an effective low - energy expression in the sense that it only describes the ` stringy ' variables and is applicable as long as the effects of thickness of the string and of its internal structure can be neglected .",
    "denoting @xmath57 the mass scale at which such approach becomes invalid ( e.g. the thickness of the string @xmath58 ) , one can write the condition for the applicability of the effective action ( [ a0 ] ) in terms of the length scale , @xmath59 , and the momentum scale @xmath60 . assuming that the initial very long string with tension @xmath61 is located along the @xmath62 axis",
    ", one can readily find that the action ( [ a0 ] ) has a nontrivial stationary configuration , the bounce , namely , that of a disk in the ( t , x ) plane occupied by the phase @xmath63 , as shown in figure 2 , with the radius r _ s = _ 1-_2  , [ rc ] which is the radius ( one half of the length @xmath29 ) of the critical gap .",
    "the difference between the action ( [ a0 ] ) on this configuration and on the trivial one is exactly the expression for the exponential power in eq.([g0 ] ) , and the condition for applicability of the effective action ( [ a0 ] ) requires m_0 r _ s = m_0 _ 1-_2 1  .",
    "[ rineq ] generally one also has @xmath64 , and for the strings in weakly coupled theories @xmath65 , so that the power in the exponent in eq.([g0 ] ) is large , which justifies a semiclassical treatment .",
    "the probability of the transition is determined@xcite by ( the imaginary part of ) the ratio of the path integrals @xmath66 and @xmath67 calculated with the action ( [ a0 ] ) around respectively the bounce configuration and around the initial flat string : _",
    "[ rz ] it can also be reminded that , as explained in great detail in ref.@xcite , that the imaginary part of @xmath66 arises from one negative mode at the bounce configuration , and that due to two translational zero modes the numerator in eq.([rz ] ) is proportional to the total space time area @xmath68 in the @xmath69 plane occupied by the string , so that the finite quantity is the transition probability per unit time ( the rate ) and per unit length of the string .    in order to evaluate the relevant path integrals with pre - exponential accuracy we use the cylindrical coordinates , with @xmath70 and @xmath71 being the polar variables in the @xmath69 plane ( of the bounce ) , and @xmath72 being the transverse coordinate .",
    "we consider only one transverse coordinate , since the effect of each of the extra dimensions factorizes , so that the corresponding generalization is straightforward .",
    "we further assume , for definiteness , that the space - time boundary in the @xmath69 plane is a circle of large radius @xmath73 , where the boundary condition for the string is @xmath74 .",
    "the small deviations of the string configuration from the bounce , illustrated in fig.3 , can be parametrized by the radial ( @xmath75 ) and transverse ( @xmath76 ) shifts of the boundary between the string phases : r ( ) = r _ s + f ( ) ,  z()= ( )  , [ bv ] and by the variations of the surfaces of the two string phases : @xmath77 and @xmath78 , where , naturally , z_1(r",

    "one can readily see that in the quadratic part of the action ( [ s12 ] ) the ` longitudinal ' variation of the bounce boundary in the @xmath69 plane , described by the function @xmath80 completely decouples from the rest of the variables .",
    "this implies that the path integral over @xmath75 can be considered independently of the integration over other variables and that it enters as a factor in @xmath81 . on the other hand",
    "it is this integral that provides the imaginary part to the partition function , and it is also proportional to the total space - time area @xmath68 .",

    "this however is a simple issue which is resolved by a straightforward shift of the integration variables @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",

    "the subsequent calculation of the ratio of the partition functions in eq.([g2 ] ) can in fact be reduced to a calculation of @xmath96 only . in order to achieve this reduction",
    "one should organize the partition function @xmath67 in the denominator of eq.([g2 ] ) in a form similar to eq.([z12bb ] ) as follows .",
    "although the flat string configuration makes no reference to a circle of the radius @xmath97 , the partition function @xmath67 can be calculated by first fixing the transverse variable @xmath72 at @xmath98 : @xmath99 and separating the integration over the bulk variables .",

    "the general formula for the effective length at arbitrary values of @xmath376 is found using eq.([kfwlt ] ) and the expression ( [ block3d ] ) for the elements of the matrix @xmath377 . in this way",

    "in this paper we considered the decays of metastable topological configurations such as string and domain wall . for each process",
    "we found the rate at zero temperature and calculated catalysis factor at finite temperature . using the relation between catalysis factor and probability ( effective ) length of a collision of the goldstone bosons we found probability of a string ( domain wall ) decay in a collision of two particles .",
    "the main conclusions that can be drawn from the presented here study can be formulated as follows    1 .",
    "the effect on the preexponential factor in the tunneling decay rate arising from the goldstone modes living on strings and walls is expressed in terms of boundary terms in the path integral around the bounce configuration .",
    "this effect is fully calculable within the low - energy effective action of the nambu - goto type , and essentially reduces to a renormalization of the tension of the interface between the two phases of the topological defect .",
    "we have found that this property is unique for the strings and walls and is generally lost in a description of decay of topological objects with more dimensions , where one would have to go beyond the effective nambu - goto description .",
    "the thermal effects in the tunneling rate are also fully calculable and are described by an expansion in powers of the temperature .",
    "the power - like , rather than exponential , behavior of the thermal terms is due to the presence of the massless goldstone bosons .",
    "the expansion for the thermal catalysis factor converges as long as the temperature is less than the inverse diameter of the bounce , so that in the euclidean calculation of the bounce configuration to ( the imaginary part of ) the free energy there is no obstruction to periodically replicating the bounce with the matsubara period @xmath247 . for the decay of strings this range of temperatures corresponds to the dominance of the ( thermally enhanced ) quantum tunneling over the classical thermal effects , and at the critical temperature @xmath30",
    "the regime of the transition changes and the classical thermal effects take over . for the domain wall",
    "decay the classical thermal activation starts dominating at a lower temperature , where the thermal enhancement of the quantum tunneling is still very small .",
    "4 .   the thermal enhancement of the tunneling rate can be viewed as and additional contribution to the decay probability arising from collisions of the goldstone bosons which are present in the thermal state .",
    "such an interpretation in fact allows to determine the rate of destruction of the considered topological objects in collisions of the goldstone bosons . in order to unambiguously identify in the thermal expansion the terms corresponding to the contribution of collisions between a given number of the bosons , we have modified the considered statistical ensemble by introducing a ( fictitious ) negative chemical potential @xmath292 for the goldstone bosons",
    "the calculated dependence on @xmath292 and @xmath23 of the preexponential factor in the decay rate thus serves as a generating function for the rates of the decay induced by collisions of particles , including the dependence of those rates on the energies in the collisions .",
    "we find that a destruction of a string takes place only in collisions of even number of the goldstone bosons , while a metastable wall can be destroyed in collisions of any number of the bosons , @xmath381 .",
    "we have calculated in a closed form the energy behavior of the probability of destruction of a string in a collision of two goldstone bosons , which is valid at an arbitrary relation between the energy @xmath380 and the infrared scale in the problem @xmath382 .",
    "the found expression takes an especially simple form of eq.([w20 ] ) for the decay of a string into ` nothing ' 7 .   at large values of @xmath383",
    "the collision - induced decay rate contains an exponential factor @xmath384 , which has been previously argued@xcite within the leading semiclassical approach and corresponds to a full transfer of the energy from the colliding particles to the tunneling degrees of freedom .",
    "one can readily notice that our calculation of the collision - induced rate through a thermal ensemble with an artificially introduced chemical potential is quite indirect . in a sense , this approach is reminiscent of the treatment in ref .",
    "@xcite , where finite volume effects in the energy of a two - particle state are related to the binary scattering amplitude .",
    "the obvious difference is that we calculate the free energy of a statistical ensemble rather than of a particular quantum state . in relation to this part of our calculation",
    "it would certainly be illuminating to have a more direct , and possibly simpler method for calculating the probability of creating semiclassical objects , such as the bubbles of the stable phase , in collisions of particle .",
    "however , lacking such a method at present , we have to resort to the indirect calculation described in the present paper .",
