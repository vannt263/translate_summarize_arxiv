    "for the international conference on theoretical physics that took place in 2002 at the unesco conference centre in paris , chen nin yang entitled his special plenary lecture _ thematic melodies of twentieth century theoretical physics : quantisation , symmetry and phase factor_. at that time , nobody in the audience must have been surprised that symmetry was presented as one of the major concept that extensively irrigated physics since 1905 ; but , as yang@xcite reminds us , it was not before the 1930 s that the ideas of symmetry , invariance and more generally the `` unfamiliar sophisticated mathematical concepts '' borrowed from group theory started to be widely accepted by physicists .",
    "more than ten years after emmy noether obtained her deep results , even the conservation laws  in particular the conservation of energy at microscopic scales like in the  @xmath0-decay  seem to have been not as firmly established as they are now , according to in an attempt to explain the rarity of the references to noether s work in the physics literature four decades after 1918 .    during the twentieth century , the development of quantum physics and relativity came with a semantic shift of the word `` symmetry '' in accordance with the increasing power of such a conceptual instrument .",
    "mathematicians and theoretical physicists have enlarged its meaning far beyond the one it had in the previous centuries @xcite . among the multiple uses of symmetry in theoretical physics and more generally in science , i propose to discern four clusters associated with the notion of transformation , comprehension , invariance and projection . after having defined these four facets in the next section ,",
    "i will discuss them individually with more details in sections  [ sec : transformations ] ,  [ sec : comprehension ] , [ sec : invariance ] and  [ sec : projection ] respectively .",
    "these four notions are more or less explicit and fully recognised in the natural philosophy since its very beginning but , as far as i know , addressed with very loose relations between them , if any .",
    "contemporary theoretical physics point of view on symmetry offers a new and very precise way to tight bind these notions together and cross - fertilise them . to make a long story short , originally being an aesthetic criterion it evolves in science into an efficient method of classification before it becomes a powerful theoretical tool to guide and even dictate our way of constructing models and theories .",
    "more precisely , symmetry allows    1 .",
    "[ it : linrep ] to build ( linear ) algebraic representationsi use the epithet `` algebraic '' to reinforce the distinction between a ) the precise mathematical meaning of `` representation '' in the present context ( see also   [ subsubsec : algrep ] , fig .  [",
    "fig : representation ] below ) , b ) the `` internal '' meaning it takes in cognitive science ( mental representation ) and c ) the usual `` external '' meaning ( model , symbol , image , spoken word , written sign , play , etc . ) .",
    "all the three significations share the common point of being associated to a correspondence and can refer to the target , the domain of a mapping , one of their elements or the mapping itself .",

    "[ it : selrule ] to predict selection rules .",
    "examples of  [ it : unification ] are the unification of inertial and gravitational forces in the theory of general relativity and the unification of electromagnetic and weak interactions in the standard model of quantum field theory .",
    "conservation laws are particularly manifest in [ it : solvdyn ] and [ it : selrule ] . above all ,",
    "the selection rules concern quantum processes but , as constraints on the evolution of a system , they can be found in classical dynamics as well : the conservation of the angular momentum of a particle evolving freely in a circular billiard explains the impossibility of the inversion of the sense of its rotation around the centre . in this essay",
    "i will have to say more about  [ it : linrep ] in   [ subsubsec : algrep ] and",
    "i will focus on  [ it : universal ] in ",
    "[ subsubsec : pruning ] .",
    "the roles [ it : linrep][it : selrule ] were discovered / invented by physicists essentially along the twentieth century  .",
    "these powerful functions of symmetry , far from erasing it , strengthen what is certainly the most important one : the fact that symmetry allows    @xmath1 to classify .",
    "performing classification concerns domains broader that the one of crystals , quantum particles , living organisms , historical periods , languages and philosophical camps : any law of nature can also be seen as a traduction of an objective regularity and i will try to show how the modern interpretations of symmetry allow to give a precise and , above all , coherent meaning of the terms `` objective '' and `` regularity '' .",
    "it provides a rigorous ground for the signification of universality .",
    "it also concerns the quantitative approach of inference and understanding .",
    "some connections with the dual enquiry for emergence and reduction can also be drawn .",
    "last but not least , these conceptions of symmetry shed light on a ( the ? ) characteristic of intelligence , namely modeling , and on an elementary process necessary for rational thinking , namely abstraction . since ,",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _",
    "_ _ _ ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , p.  349 ) , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this feedback of the concept of symmetry from physics to science and from science to rational thinking is quite natural after all .",
    "in this perspective , i believe that the notion of symmetry revitalises and clarifies the long - standing philosophical debate between realists and their opponents . the notions of `` reality '' , `` being '' , `` existence '' or even `` self '' have always been tricky because one can not define them without introducing some tautology . in the endless controversial discussions about ontology , these notions are , at best , acknowledged as primary concepts ( * ? ? ? * and 673 , for instance ) and are , therefore , not necessarily understood or shared in the same way by all the different schools .",
    "even more , and not only in epistemology but in the whole philosophy as well , it is quite common to find arguments for or against realism that presuppose the `` existence '' of what they are supposed to accept or deny . what sense can be indeed given to an affirmation like `` reality does ( not ) exist '' ? in less caricatured sentences , like `` an object is independent of the subject '' or `` objective facts are an illusion '' , the meaning of `` object '' , `` subject '' , `` fact '' or even `` illusion '' and the use of the verb `` to be '' reflect some kind of reality ( otherwise we fall in a vicious circle , paved with liar - like paradoxes where illusion is itself an illusion , etc .",
    "this argument is also approved by fine , @xcite , chap .  7 , ",
    "3 , first paragraph ) .    aside from practical",
    "( `` fitted '' as darwin would have said , `` convenient '' as poincar should have preferred ) everyday life , even an ultra anti - realist like a solipsist must accept the conclusion of the famous descartescredo `` i think , therefore i am '' .",
    "nominalists must accept the existence of equivalence classes that each word denotes .",
    "agnostic empiricists , phenomenologists , positivists , pragmatists , idealists , etc . must deal with the existence of facts , sensations , mental representations and so on .",
    "post - modernists of every kind use the existence of equivalence classes like historical events , social structures and groups , cultural beliefs , etc . that , whether contingent or not , may become true objects of scientific studies as soon as they contribute to a rational schema ( the social or human sciences ) . as far as rationality is concerned  and , i would say , by definition of what rationality means  the best we can do is to remain at least non self - contradictory , in a _ virtuous circle _ so to speak",
    ". my preference in this matters inclines to distribute the notion of existence into a sort of holistic web where entities have a more or less high _ degree of reality _ according to how tightly bounded they are by coherent and logical relations .",
    "i will try to show how the four facets of symmetry , through the cardinal concept of equivalence classes , help us to gain in coherence or , at least , help us to anchor and place in this circle .",
    "anyway , wherever we stand , an ouroboros loop remains unavoidable because we , as intelligent subjects , are fully part of the world and may be , therefore , considered as objects of knowledge as well .    the two oil paintings by ren magritte entitled `` la condition humaine '' ( the human condition ) could have been chosen to illustrate the complex relation between real and its representation , but its circularity is even more admirably rendered by maurits cornelis escher s lithography `` prentententoonstelling '' ( print gallery , fig .",
    "[ fig : escherprintgallery ] ) see also @xcite .    of course , i can take on safely all the self - reference aspects of the present reflections since , as being hopefully rational , they are therefore partly recursive ( rational thinking must obviously be broad enough in scope to embrace the process of rational thinking itself ) : to play with the multiple senses of the word `` reflection '' and to use a metaphor borrowed from laser physics , i hope that , through this paper , some light will be produced or at least coherently amplified , like the beam in a resonant optical cavity . this somehow risky and ambitious attempt to enlighten different other fields by extrapolating some notions",
    "whose most precise meaning can only be offered by mathematics and physics was already a strategy proposed by helmholtz in 1868 , according to ; the latter analyses carefully the precautions that must me taken to achieve this goal precisely with the help of the notion of symmetry .",
    "the physical meanings of the notion of symmetry will be our guidelines throughout this essay .",
    "however , i will start by rather formal considerations where the physical motivations remain in the background .",
    "it is only from the next sections that i will develop the physical interpretations and induce to a broader domain the matter of the present section .",
    "after the first version of this work was composed i became aware of book .",
    "the deep connection between symmetries , classifications and groups that will be shown in  ",
    "[ subsec : classification ] is already present in gordon and elena contributions .",
    "some considerations on the three first facets have already been proposed by @xcite .",
    "the oldest known trace of symmetry involved in a thought process are the engraved pieces of red ochre found at blombos cave in south africa ( fig .",
    "[ fig : blombosochre ] ) and are estimated to be older than 70,000 years @xcite .",
    "most likely , we will never know whether these engravings had a symbolic role or were a pure aesthetical game .",
    "however , historically , the concept of symmetry was first employed to refer to an aesthetic harmony made of unity , rhythm or balanced proportions emanating from internal relations , for instance in a sense exquisitely expressed by charles baudelaire in his famous poem _",
    "correspondences_.    in a scientific context these associations are formulated with some mappings  @xmath2 , defined on a set  @xmath3 of elements .",
    "a _ symmetry _ associated with the set of mappings @xmath4 encapsulates four significations that are more or less clearly distinguished in the literature :    1 .   a _ transformation _ @xmath5 where we retain the image  @xmath6 of an element ( or a set of elements )  @xmath7 by one mapping  @xmath8 belonging to  @xmath4 .",
    "2 .   a _ comprehension _ : we retain all the images of  @xmath7 obtained when applying all the mappings in  @xmath4 and collect them in the set @xmath9 when applied to many ( and ideally all ) elements of  @xmath3 we can see the mapping  @xmath10 as being a _",
    "classification_. 3 .",
    "an _ invariance _ : applying any mapping  @xmath2 of  @xmath4 on any subset of  @xmath11 gives again a subset of  @xmath11 . in the case of a mirror symmetry for instance , the action of  @xmath2 on the pair  @xmath12 where  @xmath13 is a set of points of space does not modify @xmath14 .",
    "a _ _ projection _ _ or _ symmetry breaking _ : rather than dealing with the invariant sets ( also called globally invariant or symmetric sets ) @xmath15 , @xmath16 we retain only one element for each @xmath11 i.e. @xmath17 such that  @xmath18 formally , we can see the projection as a mapping  @xmath19 where an @xmath7 is chosen to be a representative of each  @xmath11 .",
    "projection constitutes the inverse operation of comprehension and rather than the widely acknowledged expression _ symmetry breaking _ , it should have been more precise to talk about _ invariance breaking_.      recall that any classification requires the fundamental mathematical concept of _ equivalence relation _ : it is a binary relation , hereafter denoted by @xmath20 , between elements of a set  @xmath3 which is , by definition ( * ? ? ?",

    "we can define @xmath30 saying that this relation is reflexive means that there exists a transformation in  @xmath2 for which @xmath7 is invariant .",
    "a sufficient condition is of course that    a )  @xmath4 includes the identity mapping .    the symmetry property is fulfilled if    b )  every mapping is invertible and its inverse must belong to @xmath4 .",
    "finally , a sufficient condition to have the reflexivity property of the binary relation is the closure property for  @xmath4 :    c )  the composition @xmath31 of two mappings belonging to @xmath4 remains in @xmath4 .    properties a ) , b ) , c ) are rather intuitive when using the language of transformations :    a )  doing nothing is a ( somehow trivial ) transformation ;    b )  every transformation can be undone ;    c )  making two successive transformations is a transformation .    together with the associativity of the composition law ",
    "we always have @xmath32 they define the set  @xmath4 as a being _",
    "group_. the set  @xmath33 defined by   is called the _ equivalence class _ of  @xmath7 and collects all the elements that are equivalent to @xmath7 i.e. related by the equivalence relation .    summing up",
    ", we have seen how symmetry and classification are intimately related and why the group structure arises naturally .",
    "* remark : * it is conceptually interesting to remark that not only working with a group of transformations is sufficient for having a classification , but it is also a necessary condition in the sense that , given a classification , we can always construct an ad hoc group of transformations  @xmath4 such that   for the a priori given equivalence relation . for example we can choose  @xmath4 as the group generated by all one - to - one mappings ( bijections ) that are the identity everywhere but on one class .",
    "there is also the mathematical possibility of working with a set  @xmath4 that is not a group but for which   is still an equivalence relation . for instance",
    "take for  @xmath4 the set of all mappings  @xmath34 whose restriction to one class  @xmath11 is a bijection and that sends any element belonging to @xmath35 to one chosen representative element of  @xmath36 . except for degenerate cases where there is only one class or when all but one of them have exactly one element ,",
    "@xmath4 has generally not the closure property , does not contain the identity and the  @xmath34 are not invertible .",
    "in physics i do not know any relevant examples of such a situation .",
    "the procedure of constructing new mathematical _ objects _ as being equivalence classes is omnipresent in mathematics .",
    "the set of equivalence classes in  @xmath3 constructed from the relation  @xmath20 constitutes the so - called quotient set denoted by  @xmath37 .",
    "just to retain one fundamental example : a hierarchy of numbers can precisely be built with equivalence classes defined at each step with an appropriate equivalence relation : the rational numbers being equivalence classes of ordered pairs of integers , the real numbers being equivalence classes of ( cauchy ) sequences of rational numbers ( and appear , therefore , as classes constructed from classes ) , the unit - modulus numbers can be seen as classes of real numbers considered as being equivalent if they differ by an integer multiple of @xmath38 ( classes from classes from classes ) .",
    "more generally , we first define a new set  @xmath39 of elements constructed from the elements of  @xmath40 and then we classify them in  @xmath41 using an equivalence relation  @xmath20 defined in @xmath39 .",
    "another standard example is given in euclidian geometry :  @xmath40 is the set of points , @xmath42 is the set of ordered pairs of points and , eventually , vectors appear as equivalence classes of ordered pairs of points , two pairs of points being equivalent if and only if they form a parallelogram .",
    "the objects formed this way gain a sort of autonomy with respect to the primitive elements from which they are built .",
    "the different operations or relations that may exist in  @xmath40 can be used to define operations in  @xmath43 provided that they do not depend on the choice of the representative elements in the classes .",
    "therefore , computations in  @xmath43 can often ( but not always , see the last paragraph of   [ subsec : invbreak ] ) be done without any reference to computations at the `` lower '' level in  @xmath40 . to keep working with the same previous example , in a @xmath44-dimensional space",
    ", one can add two vectors using their @xmath45 coordinates , not using the @xmath46  numbers that encode the position of each points of the two representative pairs .",
    "then , when constructing the upper level  @xmath43 the information that encodes the distinction between all the elements of a class at the lower level is erased .",
    "in other words the `` internal position '' of an element in a class has been made irrelevant or superfluous @xcite as far as the manipulations of the elements of  @xmath43 are concerned .",
    "moreover , the main motivation of constructing equivalence classes is to obtain a richer structure .",
    "one can therefore truly speak of _ mathematical emergence _ in the sense that we can draw out properties in  @xmath43 that are not relevant for  @xmath40 . the emergent notions ( e.g. continuity or borel measure ) concern the elements of  @xmath43 ( e.g. the real numbers ) rather the elements of  @xmath40 ( e.g. the integers ) .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ( * ? ? ?",

    "furthermore i will follow and will consider that two active points of view can be discriminated .",
    "i will emphasise that the three physical interpretations of a transformation require the division of the universe in three parts , not two : the system  @xmath47 ( the object ) , the measurer  @xmath48 ( the subject , the observer ) who describes quantitatively  @xmath47 with the help of measuring devices , an environment  @xmath49 made of everything else and that is necessary to detect if effectively  @xmath47 or  @xmath48 have been transformed or not ( figure [ fig : transfo_passive_active ] ) . in a passive transformation ,  @xmath47 remains anchored to  @xmath49 and the measurer is transformed to  @xmath50 ( for instance the measuring instruments , the reference frame , the standards are changed ) . in the active points of view",

    "active ) transformations , like parallel transport , of geometrical objects such as vectors or forms defined on a manifold are conceptually different from ( passive ) coordinates changes .",
    "however , in physics ( and in all empirical sciences ) , active and passive transformations have much stronger conceptual differences (    [ subsec : movingboundaries ] and [ subsec : reprod_object ] ) as well as important operational differences (    [ subsubsec : opdiff ] and [ subsec : poincare ] ) .      since  @xmath47 and",
    "@xmath48 necessarily interact , the threshold between them can be a matter of convention : in the michelson - morley experiment , we may decide freely if the mirrors of the interferometer are included in  @xmath47 or in @xmath48 .",
    "as noted by , this convention is linked to the choice of what facts are considered to be observed , registered and acknowledged by  @xmath48 .",
    "for instance during an observation of the sun , @xmath48 can consider that he counts the sunspots directly or , rather , that he counts the dark spots that appear in the projection screen he uses ; he can measure the degree of excitation of the retina cells of another human being looking throw a telescope or look on a pet scan screen the activity of the corresponding brain areas during the observation .",
    "solving the a priori ambiguity of what a `` direct '' observable phenomenon or a `` sense datum '' is consists in choosing where we place , in a whole chain of processes , the border between  @xmath47 and  @xmath48 that defines the so - called `` external world '' ( implicitly external to  @xmath48 , for a comment on this expression see sankey,@xcite ) .",
    "consequently , before the interpretation in terms of _ correlations _ between data and in terms of concepts forged to cement them , this operation of cutting the chain constitutes an unavoidable task of science whose difficulty measures how remote we stand from our human sensations and from our original evolutionary - shaped abilities ( the so - called intuition or common sense ) .    _",

    "the transformations that are most pertinent are those that can be applied to a wide range of entities while keeping simple rules , that is , defined with less information than the set of elements they act on ( we will come back in   [ subsubsec : pruning ] to the reduction of information provided by any classification and therefore any symmetry ) . a reversible transformation that turns a pumpkin into a coach ,",
    "whether it concerns the three - dimensional objects or a morphing between two - dimensional images , must encapsulate the huge amount of information than encodes the pumpkin and the coach ; it can hardly be applied to anything else without artificially introducing some additional ad hoc information .",

    "the relevant groups of transformations that are considered in physics have been abstracted independently of the elements that are transformed .",
    "for instance , the usual transformations like space - translations or rotations have their roots in our intuitive geometrical conception of the three - dimensional space ; yet , in mathematical physics , they have now acquired the status of an `` abstract '' group  @xmath53 that can be _ represented _ in many ways : they do not apply to three - dimensional geometrical objects only but also to a huge collection of mathematical objects living in much more abstract spaces ( specially the quantum states and operators ) . figure  [ fig : representation ] provides a schematic view of what an algebraic representation of an abstract group is .",

    "if darwinian selection has not shaped our brains like a digital device , it has neither prepared us for a natural apprehension of the world at small scales .",
    "after one century of controversy on the quantum measurement issues , we still do not know if we will be able to obtain , within a consistent theory , the reduction of a ( possibly diagonalised by decoherence ) density operator to a pure state or if this problem is irreducible any further because of our intrinsic limitations .",

    "if we ask how we can infer the existence of other selves , we just face the old problem of other minds @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , i find the problem of self much more interesting than the problem of other minds because the latter finds naturally its answer in the necessity of escaping from a sterile kind of noological solipsism .    even though quantum theory of fields offers the most brilliant and convenient way to reconcile special relativity and quantum theory , it leaves unchanged the problem of measurement .",
    "there seems to be a deep incompatibility between objective probabilities and a four - dimensional space - time .",
    "according to everett@xcite s multiworld interpretation , a bifurcation between universe branches occurs at each measurement .",
    "had this attempt come with a proposal that clarifies the special status of measurement against pure quantum events , it would have ruled @xmath127 out but at the cost of reinforcing the importance of @xmath128 and especially @xmath129 .",
    "many physical and philosophical discussions have been devoted to the arrow of time , but relatively few concern attempts to physically define the present @xcite . maybe questions @xmath128 and @xmath129 are two aspects of the same question , the first being formulated in physical terms while the other in neuropsychological terms .    a signature of a final theory should precisely to be free of parameters with contingent value .",
    "those who believe in the existence of such a theory should therefore add a fourth problem , possibly connected to the others with the help of anthropic selectionist arguments , namely ,    ( @xmath130 ) _ the problem of constants : _ how are selected the dimensionless constants like the coupling constants at low energy scales , some cosmological characteristics or even the dimension of space - time ?",
    "however , if we deny such an ultimate goal of getting rid of contingency , the importance of @xmath130 is weaken because it is the usual statement of how to digest an effective theory into the stomach of a wider one .",
    "throughout the twentieth century , the notion of symmetry has acquired extraordinary scope and depth in mathematics and , especially , in physics . in this paper",

    "we must not confuse the domain and the image of a representation ( see note  [ fn : representation ] ) albeit they live in the same ontologic virtuous circle ; otherwise we are trapped in a solipsist - like pitfall if we just deny all but the finite number of data one or many minds can grasp ( solipsism originally coined for one mind , is not less indefensible when extended to one collectivity of minds ) .",
    "\\(b ) as any experimentalist knows , quantitative measurements should , in principle , be reported with a confidence interval .",
    "if we accept the modest realistic attitude i propose in ",
    "[ subsec : modest ] , even at the ontologic level , most of the physical quantities are associated with certain amount of uncertainty and , for instance , all the scalars may be represented by a real interval as well ( more pedantically , a neighbourhood in a topological space ) . since the first proposal of a `` law of continuity '' about the continuous nature of perception by",
    ", many successors have advocated this opinion according to which `` nature never makes leaps '' .",
    "some more arguments have been developed in that direction by cournot @xcite and poincar @xcite .",
    "the quantum theory of course strengthens this argument , via heisenberg s inequalities , notably by introducing the distinction between observable and observed quantities .",
    "half - joking i often say to my undergraduate students that `` zero does not exist in physics '' and explain that they should always keep in mind that when writing the equation  @xmath131 , it means that the quantity @xmath132 is negligible ; improving the model , modifying the order of approximations or working with a better ( or a worse ! ) precision of measurements may reveal a finite value of  @xmath132 .",
    "\\(c ) we can truly consider that some neighbourhood of infinity exists in physics .",
    "for my camera , infinity starts beyond 10 meters . in condensed matter , not only we can safely define a sample to be macroscopic when it contains an infinite numbers of atoms , but also we can choose the relevant quantities describing it to be continuous .",
    "the same can be said of course to any theory involving fields or waves ( including quantum wavefunctions if we consider that their ontological status is not very different from the classical electromagnetic waves for instance ) .",
    "\\(d ) following the same vein , actually very few physical quantities seem to me to be fundamentally discrete ( up to now ) : some topological indexes in condensed matter , some eigenvalues of some quantum operators like the angular momentum , the charge conjugation , the parity , the time reversal operator or the number of particles in a fock space are such candidates but not the eigenvalues of a hamiltonian since the coupling with the environment turns the discrete quantum energies into bands .",
    "i would also add the dimension of space - time to this short list .",
    "however , the dimensional regularisation trick @xmath133 introduced by  , though avoidable and empty of physical interpretation , provides another example of the pragmatic convenience of continuity .",

    "even a simple qbit is characterised by a continuous relative phase .",
    "\\(g ) in quantum field theory , interactions provoke the condensation of bare particles into dressed particles ( formally , as the interactions change we move inside a class of fock spaces ; this hilbert space as a whole is non - separable , i.e. that a continuous index is necessary to label every dense set , see streater and wightman , @xcite ) .",
    "this phase transition is obviously observed in condensed matter physics ( phonons , superfluidity , superconductivity , bose - einstein condensate , etc . ) but may also have occurred at a cosmological scale : the apparently discrete electric charges or masses of the elementary particles described by the standard model are involved in the coupling constants of interactions and , as renormalised quantities , may change continuously .",
    "\\(h ) even though we can construct fundamental units of length and time ( the planck length and mass ) this does not imply the discretised nature of space - time . up to now we have found no experimental clues that space - time is discrete ; without any satisfactory quantum theory of gravity , we can not but speculate about the ultraviolet cut - offs as being , say , given by the planck length .",
    "\\(i ) continuity and even smoother properties are also ubiquitously relevant in physics because they allow to take into account structural stability .",
