    "neutral species should be detectable in gas with a large hi@xmath2column density .",
    "the detection of ci@xmath2associated with dla would be particularly interesting , since the ground - state fine - structure excitation depends on the cosmic microwave background radiation , @xmath83 , and measuring the relative ground - state populations one can estimate the excitation temperature and an upper limit for @xmath83 at that epoch ( e.g. ge et al .",

    "the complex structure of the @xmath0 dla and the considerable noise in the ci@xmath21560 region makes it difficult to deblend ci@xmath2@xmath87 from further ci@xmath2components . for the system at @xmath1",

    "the upper limit for the system at @xmath1 is still compatible with the conditions expected for galactic gas but could also hint at a lower ci@xmath2content as observed for a @xmath92 dla towards 3c286 ( boiss et al .",

    "the evolution of the metagalactic ionizing background ( more intense at high @xmath3 than at @xmath93 , e.g. haardt & madau 1996 ) is probably the main reason of the ci@xmath2/hi@xmath2evolution with @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "the local presence of dust could also be playing a role , since dust grains could shield more efficiently the gas from being photoionized .",
    "in fact , the dla in table  8 with a low dust content show a low ci@xmath2/hi@xmath2ratio , regardless of the redshift .",
    "we do not see ( h@xmath94 ) or co absorption , consistently with the low metal abundances .    molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath94 ) has numerous transitions at @xmath95   and carbon monoxide ( co ) at @xmath96   .",
    "because of the blending problem it is better to look for absorption - free windows where strong h@xmath94 is expected than looking for strong lines themselves ( ge & bechtold 1997 ) .",
    "we do not find absorption at the expected positions of some strong h@xmath94 lines ( e.g. around @xmath97 ) associated with the dla at @xmath1 .",
    "the h@xmath94/h ratio is small compared to galactic interstellar clouds , a common result for dla ( ge & bechtold , 1997 ) . for the dla at @xmath0 ,",
    "the spectra do not cover the region where h@xmath94 absorption is expected .",
    "we searched for strong co transitions ( @xmath98 = 1477.568 , 1477.355 , 1509.75 , 1419.046 , 1392.525 , 1544.451  ) and obtained @xmath48 upper limits of logn(co)@xmath99 for the dla at @xmath1 and logn(co)@xmath100 at @xmath0 ( where only @xmath98 = 1544   falls in the available wavelength range ) .",
    "contrasting these values with the upper limits derived by lu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) at the keck hires resolution for several dla at high @xmath3 , we find that our co limits are roughly comparable to the values deduced for diffuse interstellar clouds in the milky way .",

    "this suggests that the region between 100 and 150 kms@xmath5is less ionized , since the feature could not be identified as a metal line associated with another absorber .",
    "the difference between mgi@xmath2  and mgii@xmath2  profiles could hint at a non - negligible contribution of an intervening hii@xmath2  region for this system .",
    "the ionized gas would produce an extra contribution to the column densities of species with an ionization potential larger than 13.6 ev , so that the measured abundances of ions like feii@xmath2 , mnii@xmath2 , siii@xmath2and znii@xmath2  would correspond to both regions .",

    "this main complex shows no ordered profile and is consistent with absorber components distributed randomly in @xmath104 .",
    "the remarkably complex structure of low and intermediate @xmath3 dla provide new hints about their nature .",
    "two kinds of models have been discussed to explain kinematic characteristics of dla at high @xmath3 : ( 1 ) thick rotating disks evolving without merging to form present - day galaxies ( prochaska & wolfe 1997a , b,1998 ) , and ( 2 ) merging protogalactic clumps in the standard cold dark matter cosmology ( haehnelt et al .",
    "1998 , mcdonald & miralda - escud submitted ) .",
    "the model of rotating thick galactic disks can explain the edge - leading asymmetry of profile structures extending up to @xmath105 kms@xmath5 .",
    "an asymmetric structure where the absorption decreases monotonously is found in the system at @xmath1 , but the one at @xmath106 shows a non - ordered profile .",

    "1997 , vladilo et al .",
    "1997 ) have suggested that dwarf galaxies rather than spiral galaxies could be responsible for dla .",
    "the extent of the kinematic profiles of our two new dla are again too large to be explained by individual dwarf galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , khersonsky & turnshek ( 1996 ) showed that dla can be associated with neutral gas in giant hydrogenous clouds that could be associated with any type of galaxy or protogalaxy .    considering only the deepest part of the absorption ( @xmath107 ) most profiles in a sample of high @xmath3 dla studied by ledoux et al .",

    "our dla at @xmath1 and @xmath109 match fairly well this behaviour , which is expected in cdm structure formation scenario ( e.g. kauffmann 1996 ) , but not if dla are disks which do not evolve kinematically .",
    "similarly to the models described by haehnelt et al .",
    "1998 for high @xmath3 , the velocity broadening in the clumps at intermediate @xmath3 would be due to a mixture of random motions , infall , merging and also rotation , which would still be important at smaller scales and could be responsible for the edge - leading asymmetry observed in some of the clumps .",
    "wolfe & prochaska ( 1998 ) found a correlation between kinematics and metallicity for a sample of 17 dla . at @xmath110",
    "they detected no systems like our two , with a large extent in the velocity space ( @xmath111 kms@xmath5 ) and low metallicity ( [ zn / h ] @xmath112 ) at the same time .",
    "on the other hand , the new systems do show moderate @xmath2  of @xmath113 @xmath8 , following the trend of larger @xmath114 to lower @xmath2observed for high redshift dla ( wolfe & prochaska 1998 ) .",
    "the ions associated with the dla at @xmath0 towards he0515@xmath104414@xmath11seem to track each other fairly well , but the lack of unsaturated lines from several ions at some velocities makes it difficult to establish the variation of the relative abundances .",
    "however , the strongest feature in the profiles of unsaturated feii@xmath2and mnii@xmath2show two absorption features of comparable intensity , while for znii@xmath2and siii@xmath2 , the first one is clearly larger .",
    "species weakly related to dust in the galactic ism seem to show a different profile than those corresponding to refractory elements .",
    "this could mean that there is more dust present in the components between @xmath55 and @xmath115 kms@xmath5 , possibly associated with a higher metallicity level , and this dust could be partly concealing the edge - leading asymmetry .",
    "damped ly@xmath116 systems studied at high @xmath3 often show considerable siiv@xmath2and civ@xmath2absorption with profiles resembling each other , but usually different from low ions ( e.g. lu et al . 1996 ) .",
    "this suggests that highly - ionized gas is produced in distinct physical regions , which could be surrounding and shielding the low - ionized gas . in our two dla at moderate redshift , we do not find strong lines from highly - ionized species covering a much larger extent than the weakly - ionized species .",

    "stronger absorption features for the civ@xmath2doublet yielding n(civ@xmath2)= 14.38 @xmath118 could be fitted in the noisy region extending from @xmath119 to @xmath120 kms@xmath5(fig .",

    "the absence of highly ionized gas associated with the large extents of low ionized regions suggests that the ionizing background is weaker than at high @xmath3 , as expected from the cosmological expansion and from models of the ionizing background ( e.g. haardt & madau 1996 ) .",
    "we have studied the properties of the dla at @xmath1 towards he1122@xmath101649@xmath11 and at @xmath0 towards he0515@xmath104414@xmath11 .",
