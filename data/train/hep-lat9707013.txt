    "we used quadratic fits to estimate the systematic error in the scale , resulting in variations from 8 to 25% .",

    "the result , @xmath92 mev compares quite reasonably with ours .",
    "we feel that our calculations of the meson decay constants have progressed to the stage that we can control the sources of systematic error within the quenched approximation . at this point ,",
    "the major source of uncertainty within that approximation is whether to use a linear extrapolation for all of our couplings or a constant fit to the weakest ones , to extract the continuum results .    our calculations with dynamical quarks are now giving us a rough bound on the error from quenching ,",
    "but we are not yet in a position to extrapolate in dynamical quark mass or lattice spacing .",
