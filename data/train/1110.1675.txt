    "molecular collisions is an important source of decoherence in experiments with atoms and molecules in the gas phase . due to the stochastic nature of molecular collisions ,",
    "collisional decoherence is usually uncontrollable .",

    "the most widely used technique for controlling interparticle interactions in ultracold atomic gases is based on tuning a feshbach resonance with an external magnetic field @xcite .",

    "however , the collision system must remain in the @xmath20-wave scattering regime .",
    "the optimal temperature of the experiments must therefore be just below the temperature , at which the @xmath82-wave contirbution to the scattering cross sections becomes important .",
