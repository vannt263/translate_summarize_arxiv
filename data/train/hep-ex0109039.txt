    "deep - inelastic @xmath1 scattering ( dis ) at hera , in which a photon of virtuality , @xmath2 , is exchanged , can lead to the production of jets in the final state .",
    "cross - section measurements of these types of processes provide stringent tests of the perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) formalism in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculations , the structure of the proton and allow measurements of the strong coupling constant , @xmath0 .",
    "these features can be seen in the formula for the cross section , @xmath3 , which is factorised into a convolution of the hard partonic cross section , @xmath4 , and the proton s parton density , @xmath5 : @xmath6 the hard partonic cross section is a power series expansion in @xmath0 and is calculable in pqcd .",
    "the proton s parton density is derived from fits to published data , such as inclusive dis measurements  @xcite and high transverse energy jet production in @xmath7 production  @xcite .    in the region of momentum fraction , @xmath8 , and @xmath2 in which dis jet measurements are currently performed ,",
    "the quark density in the photon is well constrained from particularly inclusive dis measurements . at high @xmath2 where the quark initiated process , qcd compton ( see figure  [ fig : feyn](a ) ) , is dominant",
    ", the jet cross section measurements test pqcd . at lower @xmath2 , where the boson - gluon fusion process ( see figure  [ fig : feyn](b ) ) is dominant , measurements of the jet cross sections provide complementary information on the gluon density in the proton , which from dis is only constrained through the interpretation of scaling violations in nlo",
    "fits .",
    "( 0,0)(100,100 ) ( 137,110)*(a ) * ( 211,110)*(b ) *    in this paper , the latest measurements from both the h1 and zeus collaborations on dis jet production will be discussed . initially the jet cross section comparisons with nlo",
    "will be shown and then the extraction of the gluon density and @xmath0 will be presented .    limitations of both the current data and theory and some of their possible solutions will be addressed . in particular , the measurements raise the following issues :    * at which points are the theoretical or experimental errors dominant ? * which of the two `` natural '' scales , @xmath9 and transverse energy , @xmath10 , is the more appropriate ? * is there a region where the dglap  @xcite formalism breaks down and bfkl  @xcite is more appropriate ?",
    "* is there an effect of the resolved photon ?",
    "the two inclusive jet measurements presented here have different goals ; the first is concentrated in a `` safe '' region to test pqcd and extract @xmath0 , whilst the second extends the kinematic phase space to more extreme regions to look for suggestions of bfkl effects .",
    "the safe region was defined by considering jets at a reasonably high@xmath11 of greater than 125  gev@xmath12 , high@xmath13 of greater than 8 gev in a central region of the detector , @xmath14 , where the jets are reconstructed in the breit frame of reference . to be more sensitive to bfkl effects",

    "the data fall by five orders of magnitude and are reasonably well described by the predictions corrected for hadronisation effects and using two different values for the renormalisation scale , @xmath19 .",
    "the description is quantified in figure  [ fig : incl](b ) where the ratio of the data to the prediction ( using @xmath20 ) is shown .",

    "similar results were observed when considering the cross section as a function of the transverse energy of the jet .",
    "the data can therefore be used to extract a value of @xmath0 , which was done at high@xmath11 and high@xmath13 . as can be seen in figure  [ fig : incl](b ) , extracting @xmath0 at @xmath23",
    "gev@xmath12 leads to a smaller theoretical uncertainty , arising mainly from the variation of the renormalisation scale by a factor of two .",

    "the cross section is predicted to have the form  @xcite , @xmath25 and has not be seen before in neutral - current dis jet production .",
    "the effect has been seen in charged hadron production in dis  @xcite . without tagging the nature of the final state jets ,",

    "the data are shown in different regions of pseudorapidity of the jet so as to maximise sensitivity to bfkl effects which are expected to be largest at forward values .",
    "the nlo calculation has been evaluated using two different choices of scale ; @xmath10 and @xmath9 , shown in figures  [ fig : incl_forward](a ) and  [ fig : incl_forward](b ) , respectively .",
    "( 0,0)(100,100 ) ( 166,122)*(a ) * ( 232,122)*(b ) *     + overall , the predictions generally describe the data , although with very large uncertainties of sometimes up to @xmath27 .",
    "the agreement is better at higher @xmath2 and at lower @xmath2 it is better when using @xmath9 rather than @xmath10 as the scale in the calculation .",
    "it should be noted that at these low values of @xmath2 , @xmath28 . when using @xmath10 as the scale , the nlo does poorly in the forward region at low values of transverse energy .",
    "this is exactly the region where bfkl effects are expected to show up .",
    "however , the large uncertainties on the dglap - based calculation shown , preclude any statement of the need for bfkl effects in the measurement . these large uncertainties in the theory , and hence a significant difference between nlo and the next higher order ,",
    "are probably not surprising given the lo and nlo cross sections differ by up to a factor of ten at low @xmath10 and forward @xmath29 .",
    "clearly this kind of measurement needs more accurate calculations in order to search for a breakdown of the dglap formalism .",
    "along with bfkl effects , at low@xmath11 the existence and nature of a resolved photon may also play a rle . the resolved photon is expected to be important when the transverse energy of the outgoing jets , @xmath10 is much greater than @xmath9 , whereas bfkl effects are expected to be most significant when the two quantities are roughly equal .",
    "the rle of the resolved photon has been studied in dijet production with @xmath30  gev@xmath12 and at least two jets , such that again @xmath28 .",
    "the ratio of the dijet data as a function of the momentum fraction , @xmath31 , is poorly described by the calculation when the renormalisation scale is set to the intuitive hard scale , @xmath32 .",
    "when choosing the scale to be @xmath9 , the prediction is higher and describes the data well , but suffers from a lack of predictive power due to its large uncertainty .",
    "therefore , using the natural scale , the impact of the resolved photon was studied as implemented in the calculation jetvip  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of a resolved photon into the calculation compared to the data is shown in figure  [ fig : dijets_jetvip ] .",
    "it can be seen that the calculation lies below the data at low@xmath33 and that the description improves with the inclusion of a resolved photon .",
    "the effect is larger at the lower range in @xmath2 , but is not enough to completely describe the data . due to large uncertainties in the calculations and unknowns in the underlying physics processes , fundamental parameters such as @xmath0 , are measured at higher values of @xmath2 or @xmath10 , where the uncertainties are reduced .",
    "the dijet cross section at slightly higher @xmath10 is shown as a function of @xmath2 in figure  [ fig : dijets_h1_q2 ] .",
    "note that here the jets are reconstructed in the breit frame whereas in figure  [ fig : dijets_jetvip ] they were in the hadronic centre - of - mass frame .",
    "the description of the data by the nlo calculation in figure  [ fig : dijets_h1_q2 ] is good over the whole range in @xmath2 .",
    "both data and theory also scale similarly with different minimum transverse energy requirements .",
    "the size of the lo to nlo corrections are reasonably large at low@xmath11 and the hadronisation corrections are also significant .",
    "these factors again demonstrate the need to consider higher values of @xmath2 for the extraction of fundamental parameters .",
    "the description of other variables ( not shown ) by the nlo is also generally good .",
    "the dijet cross section at high-@xmath2 , greater than 470  gev@xmath12 , is shown in figure  [ fig : dijets_zeus_q2 ] along with the inclusive cross section and dijet rate .",
    "all measurements are well described by the nlo calculation .",
    "the dijet rate is a particularly good variable to measure as it is sensitive to @xmath0 ( as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : dijets_zeus_q2](b ) ) and experimental and theoretical uncertainties are expected to somewhat cancel .",
    "cancellation of some of the theoretical uncertainty can be seen in figure  [ fig : dijets_pdf ] where the size of the uncertainty related to the parton density function is shown .",
    "this was estimated using the program epdflib  @xcite .",
    "this program propagates the statistical and systematic uncertainties of each data set used in the pdf , mbfit and provides additional pdf sets to quantify the theoretical uncertainties .",
    "figure  [ fig : dijets_pdf ] shows that the total uncertainty arising from the pdf for the rate is @xmath34 , smaller than for both the inclusive ( @xmath35 ) and dijet ( @xmath36 ) cross sections .",
    "neutral current dis with three jets in the final state has recently been measured which , with a more complex final state , has the potential to provide a more stringent test of pqcd .",
    "a new nlo three - jet calculation  @xcite allows the comparison to be made for the first time .",
    "the ratio of three- to two - jet cross sections can also be measured . as with the ratio of cross sections of two - jet and inclusive production",
    ", it is expected that there will be cancellation of some experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "again , this measurement should allow an accurate extraction of @xmath0 , with much reduced uncertainties .    in figures  [ fig:3jets_xsec ] and  [ fig:3jets_ratio](a ) ,",
    "the cross - section measurements are shown as a function of bjorken - x , @xmath37 , three - jet mass , @xmath38 and @xmath2 .",
    "predictions to lo and nlo , both corrected for hadronisation effects , are compared to the measurements .",
    "the addition of the nlo corrections are significant , particularly at low-@xmath37 and @xmath2 and low mass , and their inclusion into the prediction provides a good description of the data . also shown , in figure  [ fig:3jets_ratio](b ) , is the ratio of data to theory as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "the nlo can be seen to describe the data to within about @xmath39 over the whole region in @xmath2 .",
    "the uncertainty due to varying the value of the renormalisation scale is up to @xmath40 at low-@xmath2 and decreases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "the uncertainty arising from the value of @xmath0 and the gluon content of the proton are reasonably constant with @xmath2 and are about @xmath41 and @xmath39 , respectively .",

    "the nlo again describes the data well and , as expected , the theoretical uncertainties are significantly reduced . in particular , the uncertainty due to the renormalisation scale and gluon pdf are both considerably smaller than the uncertainty arising from varying @xmath0 .",
    "this demonstrates the potential of the distribution in providing an accurate measurement of @xmath0 .",

    "measurements of jet substructure in nc dis have been performed and used to test pqcd and perform extractions of @xmath0 .",
    "measurements of both the integrated jet shape and mean subjet multiplicity in inclusive jet nc dis were made .",
    "the lowest non - trivial - order contribution to these quantities is given by @xmath42 pqcd calculations .",
    "thus measurements of the jet shape and subjet multiplicity provide a stringent test of pqcd calculations beyond lo and allow a determination of @xmath0 .",
    "subjets were resolved within a jet by considering all particles that are associated with it and by repeating the application of the @xmath43 cluster algorithm  @xcite until , for every pair of particles @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the quantity @xmath46 was above @xmath47 .",

    "the nlo predictions give a good description of the data for all values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 and can therefore be used to perform a measurement of @xmath0 .",
    "similar results are also seen for the measurements of the jet shape .",
    "as stated in section  [ sec : intro ] , jet production at hera is directly sensitive to the gluon content of the proton at lo .",
    "therefore , the measurements shown here can in principle be used to constrain the gluon density , complementing the extractions from ( predominantly ) measurements of the proton structure function , @xmath50 .",
    "this has been performed by simultaneously fitting the inclusive and dijet cross sections and the measurements from inclusive dis .",
    "the result of this fit are shown in figure  [ fig : h1_gluon ] , where the extraction is compared to other parametrisations of the gluon pdf .",
    "the extraction from this simultaneous fit is consistent with all other parametrisations shown .",
    "the effect of the jet data in further constraining the gluon density would be enhanced by using the data at lower @xmath2 . however , due to the large theoretical uncertainties , arising predominantly from varying the value of the renormalisation scale , an accurate extraction of the gluon density from jet data remains limited .",
    "also shown in figure  [ fig : h1_gluon ] is the result of simultaneously constraining both the gluon density and measuring @xmath0 .",

    "there now exist several of these measurements from hera as well as measurements of @xmath0 from inclusive dis data . at hera",
    "there is also the opportunity to make a measurement of @xmath0 at different values of the scale , @xmath9 or @xmath10 and hence test the running of the value .",

    "the uncertainty associated with that of the renormalisation scale is significantly smaller than in the nlo - qcd fits to @xmath50 data .",
    "using the additional statistics available and those of the future , these measurements could provide very accurate measurements of @xmath0 .",
    "this could also be true for the measurement of the three- to two - jet cross section ratio , with indications of small theoretical uncertainties already observed .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties will also be significantly reduced with higher order calculations which are expected soon for fits to @xmath50 data  @xcite and within a few years for jet calculations  @xcite .",
    "many measurements of jet production in dis have been made over a wide kinematic range at hera . in general , the data are well described by nlo qcd calculations and the current proton parton densities ( convoluted with a correction for hadronisation effects ) , particularly at high scales . from these data , several measurements of @xmath0",
    "have been made , all of which agree with the world average and have uncertainties which are also competitive with the world average .    although providing good tests of pqcd , further experimental and theoretical work is needed to make really precise comparisons .",

    "both experiments currently have about 100  @xmath52 of data on tape and expect to collect about ten times this amount by the end of hera ii .",
    "this significant increase in the data sample will enable high - precision comparisons up to very high-@xmath2 values which are currently statistically limited .",
    "experimentally , the main source of systematic uncertainty arises from uncertainty in the knowledge of the jet energy scale .",
    "the current quoted uncertainty is generally @xmath53 , which can produce an uncertainty of @xmath54 in the cross section .",
    "efforts are being made ( and succeeding ) to reduce the uncertainty to @xmath55 , which will lead to an uncertainty in the cross section of @xmath56 .",
    "as most measurements already suffer from dominating theoretical errors , particularly for values of @xmath2 less than 500  @xmath57 , these further experimental improvements will require much more accurate theoretical predictions . at low-@xmath2 ,",
    "the renormalisation scale uncertainty is often greater than @xmath58 , which is too large and hinders conclusions being drawn from the comparison with data , such as the existence of bfkl effects and the need for a resolved photon .",
    "also in this region , the choice of scale is unclear with that of @xmath10 seeming to be the natural choice , as @xmath28 , but with @xmath9 appearing to better describe the data . at high-@xmath2 ,",
    "the renormalisation scale uncertainty is still the dominant source of error and its reduction essential for future measurements .",
    "there is a strong need for higher order calculations or resummed nlo programs to fully exploit the potential of the measurements being made ."
