    "the properties of an antikaon in medium are attracting much interests recently .",
    "since a theoretical calculation @xcite predicted deeply bound @xmath4 states in @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 systems , many studies have been reported in both theory and experiment .",
    "the kek group @xcite reported the observation of @xmath8 and @xmath9 states , interpreting them as deeply bound states of @xmath4 , though in a more recent experiment @xcite with a better statistics the existence of @xmath10 state could not be confirmed .",
    "finuda group also reported the observation of a deeply bound state for @xmath5 with binding energy @xmath11 mev and width @xmath12 mev @xcite . on the other hand , the authors in refs .",
    "@xcite claimed that the observed state could be explained in terms of the final state interaction of produced @xmath13 pairs .",
    "therefore , further studies are needed both theoretically and experimentally to confirm such states .",
    "if a deeply bound kaonic state exists indeed , it can be formed by very strong attraction between nucleons and an antikaon , which may lead to kaon condensation in dense nuclear matter .    possible existence of kaon condensation in dense matter was proposed about two decades ago @xcite .",
    "the subject has been studied with various models such as chiral perturbation theory @xcite , relativistic mean field models like quantum - hadrodynamics ( qhd ) @xcite and quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model @xcite . in relativistic mean field approach ,",
    "the interaction among baryons is described by scalar ( @xmath14 ) and vector ( @xmath15 ) meson fields mediating attractive and repulsive forces , respectively . in the mean field approach , due to the antiparticle nature",
    ", an antikaon feels strong attraction by both scalar and vector meson fields , which determines the optical potential of an antikaon .",
    "the kaon condensation in medium is known to be sensitive to the value of the optical potential .",
    "when we consider an antikaon in medium , it can be treated as a point - like particle in view of its property as a pseudo - goldstone boson . however , applying the ozi rule , which says the s - quark does not interact with @xmath14 and @xmath15 mesons , the optical potential of an antikaon depends only on the interaction of @xmath16 , which can feel strong attraction due to the exchange of @xmath14 and @xmath15 mesons . therefore it is worthwhile to treat an antikaon as a mit bag and compare the values of physical observables with those obtained from a point - like kaon .",
    "the qmc model originally developed by guichon @xcite assumes that quarks inside baryon bags interact with each other through the exchange of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath17 meson fields .",
    "the model has been further developed by several authors @xcite .",
    "an important revision of the model was made in ref .",
    "@xcite by introducing a density dependent bag constant to simulate partial deconfinement of quarks at high densities and to get the meson field strengths as predicted by relativistic phenomenology .",
    "this model was called the modified qmc ( mqmc ) model . then a model for a kaon as a mit bag",
    "was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the framework of qmc model in asymmetric matter , in which the interaction between nucleons and a kaon was mediated by @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath17 meson fields .",
    "the kaon condensation in hyperonic nuclear matter was then studied in ref .",
    "@xcite with the qmc model , including @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath17 meson fields , but the interaction between s - quarks and the density dependence of the bag constant were not considered .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the previous models @xcite to further include the interaction of s - quarks through the exchange of @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson fields , and assume the density dependence of the bag constants .",
    "we then study the bose - einstein condensation of @xmath4 in the neutron star with the density dependent bag constant for a kaon bag as in ref .",
    "@xcite in the framework of the mqmc model .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath2 for the density dependent bag constant of a kaon is regarded as a free parameter to be determined from the kaon optical potential , which we choose as @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 mev .",
    "our results show that the eos with kaon condensation differs significantly depending on whether we treat a kaon as a point - like particle or a mit bag . because of the repulsion due to the s - quark interaction at high densities , the equation of states ( eos ) from the qhd and qmc models without s - quark interactions are softer than those from the models including the s - quark interaction .",
    "we find that the interaction between s - quarks , which was not included in ref .",
    "@xcite can make the eos quite different .    in section",
    "ii , we present our model , extending the previous qmc model @xcite for a kaon to include the density dependence of the bag constant ( i.e. , mqmc model ) and the interaction between the s - quarks in hyperonic nuclear matter . by treating a kaon as a mit bag",
    "we calculate the equations of motion for mesons with kaon condensation . energy density and pressure of the neutron star matter with kaon bags are obtained .    in section iii",
    ", we show the numerical results for the eos and population profile of neutron star matter with hyperons at densities up to ten times normal density . using the calculated eos",
    ", we obtain the mass - radius relation of neutron star with hyperons and kaons .",
    "summary follows in section iv .",
    "in the ( m)qmc model , baryons are regarded as mit bags and the interaction between the baryons is mediated by the exchange of meson fields among quarks inside the baryon bags .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we treat a kaon as a mit bag in this work .",
    "thus we use the same framework for both kaons and baryons , treating all virtual meson fields as point - like particles . in ref .",

    "even the largest onset density @xmath139 is similar to the mean density of a typical neutron star , mass @xmath140 and radius @xmath141 km .",
    "thus , if pure nucleonic phase persists to a certain depth of the neutron star , kaon condensation is likely to be the state of matter inside the neutron star . at high densities ,",

    "it is worthwhile to compare our result with that obtained with point - like kaon in the qhd model @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the phase transition is treated as first - order and a very soft eos is obtained .",
    "on the other hand , because the softening of eos due to the kaon condensation is not so substantial in our model , the phase transition from normal nuclear phase to kaonic phase depends on how a kaon is treated in medium as well as kaon optical potetial .",
    "however , once the kaon condensation sets in , the particle composition becomes very similar at high densities regardless of the @xmath138 value , and it makes the eos also similar at high densities .    with hyperon degrees of freedom but without s - quark interactions ( @xmath142 matter ) , we obtain the composition of the neutron star matter shown in the middle column of fig .",
    "[ fig - popul ] . since antikaon has a negative charge and becomes very dominant once it is created , all the negatively charged hyperons disappear soon after the kaon condensation .",
    "condensation onset densities are 6.8 , 4.5 and 3.8 times @xmath137 for @xmath143 and @xmath20 mev , respectively .",
    "dependence of kaon condensation on the value of @xmath138 is stronger than the @xmath134 matter case .",
    "the reason for this strong dependence may be partially attributed to the existence of the hyperons before the kaon condensation . as density increases , fermi momentum of the neutrons reaches to a value that satisfies the chemical equilibrium for light hyperons such as @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "the creation of the @xmath144 and @xmath145 hyperons reduces the rate of increase of the neutron fermi momentum as a function of density , but the proton fermi momentum is hardly affected by the hyperons .",
    "then since @xmath146 becomes smaller than that without the hyperons , kaon creation condition @xmath147 becomes more sensitive to the behavior of the kaon chemical potential .",
    "the eos for @xmath142 matter , shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig - eos ] is much softer than that for @xmath134 matter because of the creation of the hyperon .",
    "the softening of the eos due to kaons on top of the creation of hyperons is less significant .",
    "for instance , the derivative of the eos @xmath148 for @xmath134 matter with @xmath149 mev abruptly becomes close to zero at the density where the kaon condensation begins , and the gap between the two eos s for @xmath150 mev and @xmath20 mev is substantial . on the other hand ,",
    "the derivative @xmath148 for @xmath142 matter undergoes only a slight decrease at the density of kaon creation , and so it remains similar to the value without the kaon condensation .",

    "now , if we switch on the interaction of s - quarks with @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons ( @xmath151 ) on top of including the hyperon degrees of freedom , we get the particle composition in the right column of fig .",
    "[ fig - popul ] . when @xmath150 mev , kaon condensation does not take place at all up to ten times the saturation density . for @xmath152 and @xmath20 mev , kaon condensation sets in at 5.1 and 3.8 times @xmath137 , respectively .",
    "the onset density of the kaon condensation is more sensitive to the value of @xmath138 than in the @xmath142 case .",
    "in addition , the population of the kaon is significantly reduced from that in the case of @xmath142 matter for all the @xmath138 values . the population of s - quarks increases at higher densities due to large production of hyperons and kaons .",
    "thus the values of @xmath0- and @xmath1- fields increase because strangeness is the source of these meson fields , but at high densities , @xmath1 meson fields increase more rapidly than @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "the effect of repulsion due to s - quark interaction becomes significant , and in particular , in case of relatively small potential ( @xmath18 mev ) , it strongly suppresses kaon condensation . on the contrary , in case of @xmath149 mev , the effect of s - quarks is relatively small to kaon condensation because of the reason mentioned above .",
    "we compare the present result with that of a point - like kaon in the framework of mqmc @xcite , where nuclear saturation properties are exactly the same as those in this work . if there is any difference , it has to come from how one treats the kaon ; a bag or a point particle .",

    "for the point - like kaon , the population of the kaon is even more dominating than that of the bag kaon without s - quark interactions .",
    "since the background baryonic matter of the kaon condensation is built on the same ground with the same saturation properties , the same models and parameters for baryons and their interactions , the dramatic difference in the kaon condensation densities and the kaon population indicates substantial dependency on the way of how to treat the kaon ; a point particle or a bag . on the other hand ,",
    "we have observed from the result of the @xmath142 case that if hyperons are included , a softening of the eos is predominantly driven by hyperons , and the role of kaons is less significant .",
    "the eos shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig - eos ] is consistent with this observation .",
    "the eos with strange - meson exchange is stiffer than that without it , which may be ascribed to the extra repulsion due to @xmath1 meson mean field .",

    "the results without hyperons ( @xmath134 ) show that kaon condensation occurs at the density of around @xmath163 , and the dependence on the kaon optical potential value @xmath138 is relatively weak .",
    "on the other hand , the neutron star mass depends on @xmath138 value sensitively with the value in the range @xmath164 for @xmath160 mev .",
    "comparing our @xmath134 result with the one obtained from the qhd model in which the nucleon and the kaon are assumed as point particles @xcite , the results are clearly contrasting . in the qhd result",
    ", kaon condensation depends sensitively on the @xmath138 value , the eos in the mixed phase is much softer than that in this work , and consequently the maximum mass of the neutron star is 10% lighter than our results .",
    "qualitatively , however , qhd and mqmc have a common aspect : the effect of the kaon condensation to the matter composition , the eos and the neutron star properties is significant and dominant when there is no hyperons .",
    "if we include the hyperons , @xmath144 and @xmath145 hyperons are created at a density of about @xmath165 .",
    "the creation of the hyperons brings down the highly accumulated neutron s fermi levels , and it causes the role of the kaon to be minor in many respects .",
    "the onset density of the kaon condensation is more sensitive to the @xmath138 value than that without hyperon , and the population of the kaon is much less than that for the @xmath134 case .",
    "the softening of the eos due to kaon condensation is non - negligible even with the hyperon , but it is not so significant as that for the @xmath134 matter .",
    "the neutron star mass differs by about 3% depending on @xmath138 value .",
    "this weak dependence on @xmath138 value is in contrast to that for a point - like kaon , which is about 10% @xcite . with the strangeness interaction , repulsion due to @xmath1-meson exchange suppresses the role of the kaon further . as a result ,",
    "the eos for the @xmath151 matter is almost the same as that without the kaon condensation for all the @xmath138 values considered .",
    "the maximum mass fluctuates by about 3% depending on the @xmath138 value , which may be within the uncertainties due to the model dependence , input parameters such as nuclear saturation properties , nucleon - nucleon , nucleon - hyperon and hyperon - hyperon interactions , and etc . in the case of @xmath142 and",
    "@xmath151 matter , compared to the point - like kaon , the role of the bag kaon is quite suppressed and the difference in the mass of the neutron star is within the errors due to various uncertainties .",
