    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) measurements of temperature anisotropies and polarization @xcite and the redshift - distance measurements of type ia supernovae ( snia ) at @xmath6 @xcite , have established that the universe is undergoing an accelerated phase of expansion and that its total energy budget is dominated by a dark energy component .",
    "the nature of this component is still unknown and many observational probes have been proposed to test its properties and redshift evolution either in the standard @xmath4-cold dark matter ( @xmath4cdm ) , modified gravity or quintessence models ( for a review see ref .",
    "while the cmb is a powerful cosmological probe of the universe at @xmath7 , the anisotropies present in cmb data ( kinetic and thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effects , weak lensing and the integrated sachs - wolfe effect ) contain precious information on the large scale structure that formed at much lower redshift .",
    "these effects can be studied and detected by cross - correlating cmb data with tracers of the large scale structure ( lss ) such as galaxies or quasars . here",
    ", we will focus on the integrated sachs - wolfe effect @xcite .",
    "the first investigations of cmb - lss cross - correlations were made in refs .",
    "@xcite using x - ray observations ( heao data ) and cmb data from the cobe satellite that allowed to constrain the bias of x - ray sources and put upper limits on the amount of a cosmological constant energy density . in a more recent series of works , a similar set of analyses",
    "have been carried which relied on cmb data from the wmap satellite and a variety of lss probes such as nvss ( nrao vla sky survey ) radio galaxies @xcite , the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) @xcite , galaxies from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) dr4 and dr5 @xcite .",
    "there is overall agreement between the different groups in finding an evidence for a positive isw signal at the @xmath8 confidence level .",
    "even more recently , several groups have started to analyze the cmb - lss correlations in a more comprehensive framework fully exploiting the capabilities of the sdss ( dr5 , dr6 ) , addressing the many possible systematic effects involved , modeling the statistical error bars and covariance properties of the data with different methods and combining the different tracers in the using monte carlo markov chains estimators for deriving the cosmological parameters ( e.g. @xcite ) .    although the results obtained from the cmb - lss are promising and have provided independent evidences for the presence of a dark energy component , their quantitative use as cosmological probes is still to be fully exploited .",
    "the timely convergence of future lss surveys like sdss - iii @xcite and high resolution cmb experiment like planck will offer the opportunity to further explore the valuable information of the isw and in general of several other lss - cmb cross - correlations in a quantitative way ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "present efforts are particularly concentrated on quantifying several systematic effects that are possibly affecting the isw signal such as noise by local variance @xcite , redshift space distortions @xcite , non - linear contributions @xcite , uncertainties in the bias estimates @xcite and contributions due to voids and clusters to the overall isw signal @xcite .",
    "however , once the systematic effects will be under control the isw is likely to become a powerful cosmological probe able to constrain for example the contribution of massive neutrinos @xcite or evolution of the dark energy component at high redshift ( e.g.  @xcite ) , which is poorly constrained by observations at the present @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on this latter issue and push the isw capabilities to the highest possible redshift regime in a way similar to that used by ref .",
    "@xcite , using the recently released sdss dr6-qso catalog of about one million photometrically selected qsos in order to give constraints on some dark energy models .    among all the dynamical dark energy models",
    ", we will consider early dark energy ( ede ) ones , in which a small fraction of dark energy is present up to the last scattering surface ( lss ) , unlike @xmath4cdm for which @xmath9 , the differences between early dark energy models and pure @xmath4cdm are particularly evident at high redshifts , over a large fraction of the cosmic time , when the first structures form .",
    "ede has been shown to influence the growth of cosmic structures ( both in the linear and in the non - linear regime ) , to change the age of the universe , to have an influence on cmb physics , to impact on the reionization history of the universe , to modify the statistics of giant arcs in strong cluster lensing statistics ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "the temperature anisotropy due to the isw effect is expressed as an integral of the time derivative of the gravitational potential @xmath11 over conformal time @xmath12 @xmath13d\\eta}~.\\label{isweq}\\ ] ] for scales within the horizon , we can relate the gravitational potential @xmath11 to the comoving density field @xmath14 by poisson equation : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the ratio of the matter density to the critical density today , @xmath17 is the hubble constant today , @xmath18 is the speed of light , @xmath19 is the redshift , and @xmath20 is the comoving wave number . from eqs .",
    "( [ isweq],[possion ] ) one can appreciate that when a cmb photon falls into a gravitational potential well , it gains energy , while it loses energy when it climbs out of a potential well . these effects exactly cancel if the potential is time independent , such as the matter dominated era ( @xmath21 ) in which the gravitational potential stays constant , @xmath22 and no isw is produced .",
    "however , when dark energy or curvature become important at later times , the potential evolves as the photon passes through it . in this case",
    ", @xmath23 and additional cmb anisotropies will be produced .",
    "the isw effect of interest here is the one produced at relatively late time , when the dark energy component is dominating the universe density budget , causing a change in the time dependence of the expansion rate , departing from pure matter dominance , and a consequent time evolution of the gravitational potentials .",
    "an early isw , not considered here , is injected soon after decoupling , when the expansion rate time dependence is in the transition between radiation and matter dominance .",
    "observing the late - time isw can be a powerful way of probing dark energy and its evolution .",
    "however , the most significant isw effect contributes to the cmb anisotropies on large scales that are strongly affected by the cosmic variance .",
    "fortunately , this problem can be solved by the cross - correlation between isw temperature fluctuation and the density of astrophysical objects like galaxies or quasars ( in the following calculations we will use the quasar catalog ) .",

    "photometrically selected qsos have become particularly important in the last few years due to the higher selection efficiency reached , that has enabled their use for meaningful statistical / cosmological analysis .",
    "the dr6-qso data set extends previous similar sdss data sets with @xmath47 efficiency @xcite .",

    "an estimate of the level of stellar contamination can be computed using the fact that the correlations properties of stars are very different from those of qsos . in particular ,",
    "a nearly flat contribution , up to large angular scales ( that correspond to small physical galactic distances ) is expected from stars of our own galaxy .    if we substitute @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the efficiency of the quasar catalog , the acf estimator of eq .",

    "otherwise , @xmath128 will become large and is comparable to the intrinsic acf of stars @xmath127 .",

    "we found that at present the results are still rather weak to provide competitive constraints on the parameters describing either the @xmath4cdm or ede models , even though constraints at the percent of sub - percent level on the energy density contribution of this component in the structure formation era can be achieved . adding present high redshift isw data to cmb data from wmap does not improve the constraints significantly .",

    "we summarize our main conclusions in more detail :    * we compute the qso auto - correlation function ( acf ) from sdss dr6-qso and extract bias and catalog efficiency : we measure the quasar - matter bias and the typical error on the bias is at the level of @xmath225 when we split in five bins the sample and of @xmath226 when we consider the whole sample .",
    "we present results for a more conservative selection of qsos using also ultra - violet excess flags and a less conservative selection that consider all the sources of the catalog .",
    "* ede models usually result in higher values for the bias than those of @xmath4cdm by @xmath227 , due to the slower growth of density perturbations in ede cosmology that requires a higher bias to match the observed value . *",
    "we compute ccf values by cross - correlating the qso number density with the cmb temperature and found an evidence at @xmath2 level for the all sample for an isw effect . at high redshift",
    "this evidence reduces to @xmath3 , which interestingly compares with the prediction of null detection in @xmath4cdm .",
    "this non - vanishing signal could be caused by the large bias , stellar contamination and large number of quasar sample , or an higher dark energy abundance at high redshifts .",
    "however , at present this signal is still too weak to distinguish between the @xmath4cdm and early dark energy models . *",
    "the parameter @xmath179 was used to quantify the disagreement between theoretical predictions and data .",
    "we found that this disagreement vanishes in the high redshift subsample , either for ede or @xmath4cdm models and is instead at the @xmath228 level for the low - redshift subsamples .",
    "* we forecasted futuristic large - scale structure measurement of the isw effect using the cross - correlation that can be provided by photometric surveys . assuming smaller error bars by a factor of three , the more accurate isw data is helpful to break the degeneracies among some parameters and results in an overall improvement on mock planck data alone by a factor 1.5 .",
    "furthermore , the standard derivations of those three parameters , @xmath178 , @xmath124 and @xmath179 , are also shrunk significantly .",
    "the future cmb measurement and galaxy survey could be very useful to detect the isw effect at a much higher significance .",
