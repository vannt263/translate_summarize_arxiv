    "the simplicity of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) homogeneous electron gas ( heg ) model,@xcite consisting of electrons interacting via the coulomb potential in a uniform , positive background for charge neutrality , allows the study of important features of the many - electron problem without the complication of a lattice potential .",
    "early pioneers of quantum mechanics discovered much of the phenomenology of the heg , including wigner s celebrated insight@xcite that the fluid will crystallize at low density .",
    "more recently , the continuing research effort to understand the behavior of the heg is motivated by the model s application in density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods can provide accurate estimates of the static properties of interacting many - body systems such as the heg .",
    "the ground state of the 3d heg for collinear spins is accepted to be an unpolarized fermi fluid at high densities .",
    "as the density decreases , qmc calculations indicate an apparently continuous transition to a spin - polarized fluid occurs , starting at a density of about @xmath2 a.u.@xcite the transition to a wigner crystal is calculated to occur at about @xmath3 a.u.@xcite qmc calculations have furnished data used within dft , most notably the energies of the heg calculated by ceperley and alder,@xcite which are used to parameterize the local - density - approximation exchange - correlation functional .",
    "semilocal@xcite and nonlocal@xcite exchange - correlation functionals may use additional properties of the heg such as the pair correlation function ( pcf ) and , especially , the on - top pair density.@xcite    the pcf is a measure of the spatial correlations of electron positions that arise from the coulomb repulsion and pauli exclusion .",
    "the spin - resolved pcf of the heg , @xmath4 , is defined such that @xmath5 is the expected number of spin-@xmath6 electrons in an infinitesimal shell of radius @xmath7 when a spin-@xmath8 electron is found at the origin and @xmath9 is the number density of spin-@xmath6 electrons . defining the spin polarization @xmath10 as the ratio @xmath11",
    ", the total pcf @xmath12 is a weighted average of the spin - resolved components : @xmath13 the on - top pair density @xmath14 is the value of the pcf at contact .",
    "the region around @xmath15 is , however , the most challenging to sample in a stochastic simulation , particularly at low densities , as the electrons are rarely found close to one another .",
    "toulouse _ _ et al.__@xcite  have developed a possible solution to this difficulty , extending the zero - variance zero - bias estimators of assaraf and caffarel.@xcite it has recently been found by fantoni,@xcite however , that the zero - bias correction required in dmc calculations significantly increases the variance .",
    "we therefore opted to use the traditional histogram estimator of the pcf in this work ; our simulations gathered enough data to ensure good precision in the reported @xmath14 values .    in light of the above challenges , while qmc methods have been very successful in calculating many quantities of interest in the heg , such as the energy and the pcf at intermediate distances , the short - range behavior of the pcf has usually been obtained by fitting qmc data to some analytical function , which can be constrained to obey exact results such as the electron - electron cusp conditions .",
    "even then , however , there is some disagreement between the pcfs obtained using different approaches .",
    "gori - giorgi and perdew developed an analytical model based on exact constraints and qmc energy data.@xcite the same authors@xcite extended an approach originally due to overhauser@xcite using a screened coulomb potential and two - electron wave functions .",
    "an alternative starting point is afforded by ladder theory , which gave rise to an early and widely used result for @xmath14 due to yasuhara.@xcite nagy _ _ et al.__@xcite  offer insight into the good agreement between these results .",
    "more recently , qian@xcite was able to relax an approximation made in the earlier ladder theory calculations and obtained a markedly different result .",
    "although several qmc calculations of pcfs for the unpolarized 3d heg have been reported , less attention has been paid to fully and , especially , partially spin - polarized systems.@xcite    in this paper we present extensive results for pcfs , static structure factors ( ssfs ) , and energies for hegs containing 118 electrons over the density range relevant to dft calculations , @xmath020 a.u .",
    "we consider four values of the spin polarization , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , although in the text we refer to the intermediate polarizations as 0.34 ( 40/118 ) and 0.66 ( 78/118 ) .",
    "we use slater - jastrow wave functions incorporating backflow and three - body correlations , we investigate twist - averaged boundary conditions and finite - size effects , and we are able to gather sufficient data to ensure that the statistical uncertainty is relatively modest .",
    "a variance reduction method is found to improve significantly the precision of twist - averaged data without introducing bias .",
    "we show the spin resolution of the pcfs and the ssfs , and we consider in particular the on - top pair density and the energy of spin polarization as functions of @xmath20 and @xmath10 .",
    "we have performed spline fits to our pcf data , which appear to be more accurate than polynomial fits .",
    "a short fortran 90 program is available to evaluate the spline fits to our pcf data.@xcite    our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : methods ] we discuss the qmc methods used in our calculations . section [ sec : results ] describes our pcf , ssf , and energy data and shows comparisons to results in the existing literature .",
    "we offer our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "hartree atomic units are used throughout this paper , so that @xmath21 .",
    "we have used the casino@xcite code to perform variational and diffusion monte carlo@xcite ( vmc and dmc ) calculations . in the vmc method ,",
    "the metropolis algorithm is used to generate a set of configurations distributed according to the square modulus of a trial wave function over which the local energy is averaged . in the dmc method , an initial wave function is evolved in imaginary time , which in principle projects out the ground state . for fermionic systems ,",
    "the antisymmetry of the wave function is , however , imposed via the fixed - node approximation,@xcite in which the nodal surface is constrained to remain unchanged during the evolution .",
    "both the vmc and dmc methods give an upper bound to the ground - state energy of the system .",
    "the quality of the parameterization of the trial wave function and the vmc optimization procedure influence the accuracy of the results and the statistical noise .",
    "our wave functions consisted of slater determinants of plane waves multiplied by a jastrow factor and included a backflow transformation .",
    "the jastrow factor comprised polynomial and plane - wave expansions in the electron - electron separation , together with three - body terms.@xcite the electron coordinates in the slater determinant were replaced by quasiparticle coordinates obtained by a backflow transformation represented by a polynomial in the electron - electron separation.@xcite the variable parameters in these wave functions were optimized using variance minimization@xcite and then linear least - squares energy minimization,@xcite as this was found to give the most accurate trial wave functions .",
    "the quality of our wave functions was such that , for unpolarized and fully polarized systems , the vmc and dmc methods produced essentially identical pcfs within the statistical precision we were able to obtain .",
    "for these systems we therefore report dmc expectation values rather than the extrapolated estimators often used in qmc studies . in partially polarized systems , however , our trial wave functions led to small but statistically significant differences between the vmc and dmc data for minority - spin electrons . in these cases",
    "we have used extrapolated estimation,@xcite in which the pcf is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the dmc and vmc pcfs , respectively .",
    "we studied 118-electron hegs in face - centered - cubic simulation cells and imposed twisted boundary conditions@xcite so that the wave function picks up a phase when an electron is translated by a simulation - cell lattice vector @xmath25 : @xmath26 the twist offset @xmath27 was allowed to vary with uniform probability over the first brillouin zone of the simulation cell during our simulations .",
    "averaging in this way has been shown to reduce single - particle finite - size effects in the energy.@xcite    we investigated the remaining variation with system size in the pcf using twist - averaged vmc simulations at @xmath28 a.u .  and @xmath29 .",
    "we show the spin resolved pcf in fig .",
    "[ fig : finite_size_effects ] .",
    "this figure , like all others in this paper except fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] , shows our raw qmc data , rather than a fit to the data .",
    "the region around the first peak in the antiparallel - spin pcf best shows the variation with system size .",
    "both @xmath30 ( upper curves ) and @xmath31 ( lower - right curves ) exhibit systematic finite - size errors for small systems in this region , converging to the thermodynamic limit on the scale of the graph at approximately @xmath32 electrons .",
    "( results for 118- and 226-electron systems are almost indistinguishable on the scale of the graph . )",
    "some cancellation of errors occurs when the spin - averaged pcf is calculated .",
    "the variation with system size appears less pronounced and less systematic at smaller @xmath7 .",
    "the on - top pair density was unaffected within statistical uncertainty . for systems with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 electrons , there was good agreement at small but nonzero distances : typical differences were of order 15  % .",
    "in contrast , the long - range pcf is affected by unavoidable finite - size errors due to the finite size of the simulation cell .",
    "twist - averaging can not remove the spurious correlation caused by the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this shows up as a small but statistically significant variation in the long - range oscillations from about @xmath36 for 118 electrons that decreases in magnitude as the system size increases .",
    "figure  [ fig : finite_size_effects ] is included as an xmgrace file in the supplemental material@xcite accompanying this paper , so that other regions of the graph may be inspected .",
    "a.u .  and @xmath16 , and at the various sizes shown .",
    "the region around the first peak in the antiparallel - spin pcf is shown , where the largest finite - size effects occur .",
    "[ fig : finite_size_effects],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the energy is known to converge much more slowly with system size than the pcf.@xcite we have therefore applied analytical corrections to our energy data following the procedure developed in refs .   and .",
    "residual single - particle finite - size effects are removed by addition of the difference between the infinite - system and twist - averaged , finite - system hartree - fock kinetic energies . the leading - order correction to the ewald energy , and leading- and next - to - leading - order corrections to the kinetic energy ,",
    "are also included .",
    "in addition , finite - size effects in the energy have previously@xcite been found to be relatively insensitive to @xmath10 , and so a cancellation of errors renders finite - size effects in the energies of spin polarization small even without any correction .",
    "the analytical arguments of holzmann _ _ et al.__@xcite lend further support to this conclusion .",
    "we also examined possible time - step and population - control biases and found them to be very small  less than one part in a thousand of the correlation energy in test cases  so we neglect them in what follows .",
    "all dmc calculations were performed using at least 1000 walkers and time steps for which the acceptance probability was generally greater than 99.7  % .",
    "we accumulate the spin - resolved pcf as an average over the set of configurations generated in the course of the simulation : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the simulation - cell volume and @xmath39 is the number of electrons of spin @xmath8 . the ssf is simply related to the fourier transform of the pcf and is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 is then spherically averaged in @xmath43-space , because the ssf only depends on the magnitude of @xmath43 in a homogeneous and isotropic system .    at high densities , the variation in the energy as the twist offset",
    "is changed can be much greater than other sources of noise in the simulation .",
    "twist - averaging can therefore be computationally expensive for high - density hegs , because a large number of twist angles are required in order to obtain a precise energy and the simulation must be reequilibrated between twists , preventing rapid changes of twist offset in a dmc calculation . to circumvent this difficulty , we have used the hartree - fock energy ( as a function of twist offset ) as a control variate.@xcite    if @xmath44 denotes the qmc energy , @xmath45 the hartree - fock kinetic energy , and @xmath46 the exchange energy as functions of twist angle , the standard way of getting the twist - averaged energy is @xmath47 , where the angled brackets denote an average over twists .",
    "another estimator is @xmath48 where the @xmath49 are coefficients that can be chosen to minimize the variance of @xmath50 . in order to account for the remaining sources of noise",
    ", we add the correction above to the energy data at each time step and , at the end of the simulation , reblock@xcite the corrected data to obtain much smaller error bars .    to illustrate the reduction in variance obtained , we apply the method to vmc data for two systems in this section : first a heg with two up - spin electrons and one down - spin electron at @xmath0 a.u .",
    "; then a 118-electron heg at @xmath0 a.u .  and @xmath16 .",
    "the vmc method allows one to simulate a large number of twist angles in parallel , so we are able to compare the corrected data to accurate twist - averages performed the standard way .",
    "it can be seen in tables [ table : small - system - ta ] and [ table:118-system - ta ] that the method successfully reduces the variance without introducing bias .",
    "although we chose twist offsets randomly throughout the first brillouin zone , the method might also improve convergence of twist - averages using monkhorst - pack@xcite grids .",
    ".energies from vmc simulations in a heg at @xmath0 a.u .  containing two up - spin electrons and one down - spin electron .",
    "the raw vmc energies are compared to the same data after a correction has been applied using hf kinetic and exchange energies as described in the text .",
    "the vmc twist - averaged energy obtained in the standard way , using just over @xmath51 twist angles , is @xmath52 a.u .  per electron .",
    "[ table : small - system - ta ] [ cols=\"<,>,<,^ \" , ]      we have performed cubic - spline fits to our pcf data . the spin resolution across the density range @xmath020 a.u .  and",
    "spin polarizations @xmath16 , 0.34 , 0.66 , and 1 was well represented by cubic - spline fits with ten knots for each spin - resolved pcf .",
    "the boundary conditions used were those of natural splines : second derivatives set to zero at the first and last data points .",
    "an example of the fits obtained is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] , where we plot raw qmc data together with fits to the data .",
    "the splines reproduce our estimate for the on - top pair density at @xmath15 , and are accurate for @xmath53 . for unpolarized and fully polarized systems ,",
    "we fit the dmc data , whereas for partially polarized systems , we provide fits to the extrapolated estimates of the pcfs .",
    "note that we used down spins as the majority spins in our simulations .",
    "we did not impose any exact results as constraints when performing the spline fits , in order to give the most accurate fit possible to our raw data . as discussed above ,",
    "our qmc data are consistent with the kimball cusp conditions , and the spline fits follow the data closely in all systems studied . on the other hand , our pcf data inevitably suffer finite - size effects at large-@xmath7 , so various sum rules requiring integration of the pcf over all space will not be satisfied exactly .",
    "these spline fits are available in the form of a small fortran 90 program that we have written and which is included as part of the supplemental material accompanying this article.@xcite subroutines from the slatec common mathematical library@xcite were used to write this program .",
    "ssfs can be obtained from these data by fourier transformation .",
    "we also compared fitting schemes previously used to represent pcf data for these systems , including those proposed by ortiz and ballone,@xcite and gori - giorgi , sacchetti , and bachelet.@xcite the former scheme struggled to describe the region around the peak in the pcf with quantitative accuracy .",
    "the latter scheme was successful at high density ( for @xmath16 ) , but less reliable otherwise.@xcite     a.u .  and",
