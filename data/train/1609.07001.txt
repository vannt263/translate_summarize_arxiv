    "the spin dependence of fragmentation functions ( ffs ) has attracted much attention since it provides not only important information on hadronization mechanism but also an important place to study properties of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "high energy @xmath0 annihilation is the cleanest place to study ffs . among different aspects of the spin dependence , vector polarizations of hyperons and tensor polarizations of vector mesons are two topics that attracted special attention because both of them can be measured by the angular distributions of the decay products .",
    "hyperon polarizations can be determined by the angular distribution of the decay products of the spin self - analyzing parity violating weak decay .",
    "different components of the tensor polarization of vector mesons can also be determined by the angular distribution of decay products of the strong decay into two spin zero hadrons .",
    "measurements have been carried out e.g. many years ago at lep for the longitudinal polarization of @xmath2 hyperon  @xcite and for spin alignments of vector mesons  @xcite in the inclusive production process @xmath3 and sizable effects have been observed .",
    "these data have attracted many phenomenological studies and different approaches have been proposed to describe them  @xcite .    in the theoretical framework of the qcd parton model , hadron polarizations",
    "are expressed in terms of different ffs  @xcite .",
    "these ffs are defined via quark - quark and/or quark - gluon - quark correlators .",
    "the results of the complete decomposition of quark - quark correlator as well as those for that of quark - gluon - quark at twist-3 for spin-1 hadrons has been presented e.g. in  @xcite .",
    "a general framework for @xmath4 has been constructed  @xcite and qcd parton model results for hadron polarizations in terms of ffs have been presented up to twist-3 .    with these results",
    ", we can make predictions on the energy dependence of hadron polarization within the theoretical framework of qcd if we know the results at a given energy .",
    "in fact , from the results presented in  @xcite , we see one distinct feature for hadron polarizations in @xmath0 annihilations at high energies , i.e. , at the leading twist , polarizations of hadrons are divided into two categories . in one of them ,",
    "the polarization of hadrons depends on the initial longitudinal polarization @xmath5 of the quark ( or anti - quark ) produced at the @xmath0-vertex and is parity violated . in the second category ,",
    "the polarization is independent of @xmath5 and is parity conserved .",
    "the most well - known example is the longitudinal polarization of hyperons such as @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , while spin alignments of vector mesons such as @xmath8 and @xmath1 are representatives of the second category .",
    "the longitudinal polarization @xmath5 is a result of weak interaction and is completely determined by the electro - weak process at the parton level .",
    "it takes the maximum for @xmath0 annihilation at the @xmath9-pole and changes very fast with energy .",
    "hence , we expect that the polarization in the first category has strong energy dependence .",
    "the energy dependence for hadron polarizations in the second category comes mainly from the scale dependence of the corresponding ffs and/or higher twist contributions .",
    "we expect that they change quite slowly with energy compared with that in the first category .",
    "we should see very much different behaviors in energy dependence .",
    "clearly , the energy dependence provides not only a good place to study the spin dependence of ff but also a good place to study qcd evolution of the spin - dependent ff and higher twist contributions . in view that there are some data available from experiments at lep  @xcite and that new measurements can be carried out in experiments at very much different energies such as bes iii and belle  @xcite and possibly at the future facilities planned and/or discussed  @xcite , it is very interesting to present some numerical results to guide experiment and test models .    in this paper , after a brief summary of hadron polarizations in terms of ffs in @xmath3 , we take the longitudinal polarization of @xmath2 and the spin alignment of @xmath1 as two representative examples for the two categories and calculate the energy dependence .",
    "we take them as examples because we have data from lep for both of them .",
    "we make a simple working parameterization for the corresponding ffs by fitting the lep data  @xcite , and evolve them to other energies .",
    "we present the results numerically that can be used as a rough guide for future experiments .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after this introduction , we summarize the results of ffs defined via quark - quark correlator , those for hadron polarizations in terms of ffs in @xmath3 and qcd evolution equations for ffs in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii , we present a working parameterization of the corresponding ffs , show the numerical results of qcd evolution at the leading order and present the energy dependence of the two representative examples .",
    "we make a short summary and an outlook in sec .",
    "high energy @xmath3 is the best place to study ffs in different connections .",
    "the results for hadron polarizations expressed in terms of ffs up to twist-3 in leading order in pqcd are given in different papers such as  @xcite . here , we make a short summary of these results and present in particular the formulae that will be used in the numerical estimations .",
    "the polarization of hadron produced in high energy reaction is described by the spin density matrix .",
    "for spin-1/2 hadrons , the polarization is described by a @xmath10 spin density matrix that is usually decomposed as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the pauli matrix , and @xmath13 is the polarization vector which is represented by the helicity @xmath14 and the transverse polarization vector @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the two unit vectors in light - cone coordinates . for spin-1 hadrons ,",
    "the polarization is described by a @xmath19 density matrix , which , in the rest frame of the hadron , is usually decomposed as @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the spin operator of spin-@xmath22 particle , and @xmath23 .",
    "the spin polarization tensor @xmath24 , and is parameterized as @xmath25 the tensor polarization part has five independent components that are given by a lorentz scalar @xmath26 , a lorentz vector @xmath27 and a lorentz tensor @xmath28 that has two nonzero independent components @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    for the fragmentation of the quark ( or anti - quark ) , the ffs are defined via the quark - quark and/or the quark - gluon - quark correlators .",
    "the quark - quark or quark - gluon - quark correlator can in general be expressed as a sum of a spin - independent part , a vector polarization dependent part and a tensor polarization dependent part . to describe the production of spin zero hadrons , we need only the spin - independent part . for spin-1/2 hadrons , the vector - polarization dependent part is involved , and for spin-1 hadrons , the tensor polarization dependent part is also needed .",
    "ffs are obtained by making lorentz decompositions of the corresponding part in terms of 4-momenta and variables describing the polarization .",
    "hence , formally , the spin independent part is exactly the same for hadrons with different spins , the vector polarization dependent part is also the same for spin-1/2 and spin-1 hadrons .",
    "the results for the complete decomposition of quark - quark correlator are summarized e.g. in  @xcite . at the leading twist",
    ", there are totally 18 tmd ffs that are summarized in table ii of @xcite . from the table",
    ", we see that 5 of these 18 leading twist tmd ffs describe fragmentation of unpolarized , 4 of them describe longitudinally polarized and 9 of them describe transversely polarized quark . for those describing unpolarized quark fragmentation , we have the well - known @xmath31 describing the number density of hadrons produced in the fragmentation and the other 4 describing the induced polarizations .",
    "similarly , for ffs of the longitudinally and transversely polarized quark , we have the direct spin transfer @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively and others describing the number density and/or `` worm - gear effects '' .    after integrating over the transverse momentum",
    ", we obtain the results in the one - dimensional case . in this case",
    ", we have only five ffs left at the leading twist , i.e. , the number density @xmath34 , the induced @xmath35 , the direct spin transfers in the longitudinally polarized case @xmath36 , and in the transversely polarized case @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we emphasize that one - dimensional ffs are needed to describe inclusive processes such as @xmath3 while three - dimensional ffs are needed for semi - inclusive processes such as @xmath39",
    ". they can be studied in the corresponding processes respectively .",
    "also , to study those ffs for unpolarized , transversely polarized or longitudinally polarized quarks , one needs to create quarks in the corresponding polarization states and know the polarizations of them before the fragmentation .",
    "it is well known that the quark or anti - quark from @xmath41 is longitudinally polarized .",
    "the polarization is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the angle between the incident electron and the produced quark , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are defined in the weak interaction current @xmath48 and the superscript denotes that they are for the electron , and similarly for different flavors of quarks .",
    "although the quark ( anti - quark ) is not transversely polarized , their transverse spin components are correlated .",
    "this is described by the transverse spin correlation function @xmath49 defined as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the scattering amplitude , @xmath52 or @xmath53 denotes that the quark or anti - quark is in @xmath54 or @xmath55 state .",
    "if we take @xmath56 as the normal of the production plane , we obtain @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "define @xmath59 ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the 4-momenta of the incident @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 is that of the @xmath9-boson , and @xmath65 is that of the produced quark ) , we can express @xmath5 and @xmath49 in terms of @xmath66 , i.e. , @xmath67 here we denote as usual @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "experimental studies are often carried out irrespective of @xmath43 or @xmath66 .",
    "the obtained results just correspond to the results integrated over @xmath43 or @xmath66 . for the polarization and correlation of quark given above ,",
    "if we integrate over @xmath43 or @xmath66 , we obtain @xmath71    we see that , the quark is negatively polarized in the longitudinal direction . also @xmath72 since @xmath73 is smaller than @xmath74 , so we have a negative @xmath49 at the @xmath9-pole .    in general , for @xmath40 , we need to consider contributions from @xmath41 , those from @xmath75 and the interference terms . in this case , we have @xmath76 here @xmath77 is the electric charge of @xmath78 , and @xmath79 and @xmath80 are given by @xmath81\\sin^42\\theta_w } , \\\\   & \\chi_{int}^q = - 2 e_q s ( s - m_z^2 ) / [ ( s - m_z^2)^2 + \\gamma_z^2 m_z^2 ] \\sin^2 2\\theta_w,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the mass and decay width of @xmath9 , @xmath84 is the weinberg angle , and @xmath85 .    after integrating over @xmath66",
    ", we obtain @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the results of @xmath80 and @xmath79 after integration over @xmath66 , and they are given by @xmath89 we see that both @xmath90 and @xmath91 depend on the energy @xmath92 , and behave quite differently in the energy dependence . for comparison , we plot them in fig .",
    "[ fig : pq ] .",
    "we see clearly that , in the energy region @xmath93 , as @xmath92 decreases , the electromagnetic interaction becomes dominate , the longitudinal polarization of quark @xmath90 goes to zero rapidly , but the correlation @xmath91 goes from negative to positive and reaches the maximum @xmath94 rapidly . for @xmath95",
    ", we have contributions from both weak and electromagnetic interactions , and they combine together to give rise to a negative @xmath5 but positive @xmath49 .",
    "the correlation between the transverse spin components of the quark and anti - quark is strong and positive .",
    "annihilation.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    from these results we see in particular the following . in @xmath0-annihilation at high energies , we have possibilities to study ffs of unpolarized , longitudinally polarized as well as transversely polarized quarks .",
    "first , we can study ffs of unpolarized or longitudinally polarized quarks by studying singly polarized reactions , i.e. , by measuring only the polarization of one hadron in the final state .",
    "more precisely , we can study one - dimensional ffs of unpolarized or longitudinally polarized quarks in @xmath3 by measuring the corresponding components of polarizations of @xmath96 in the final state . by studying the semi - inclusive process @xmath39 and measuring the polarization of @xmath97",
    ", we can study the corresponding three - dimensional ffs .",
    "second , ffs of the transversely polarized quark can also be studied in @xmath0-annihilation at high energies .",
    "but in this case , we need at least to measure polarizations or other spin dependent asymmetries of two hadrons in the final states since the nonzero quantity at the parton level is the transverse spin correlation between the initial quark and anti - quark but not the transverse polarization of the quark or anti - quark . in this paper , we start with the simplest case , i.e. @xmath3 where only one - dimensional ffs for the unpolarized or longitudinally polarized quark can be studied .",
    "hadron polarizations in @xmath0-annihilations at high energies are given e.g. in  @xcite in terms of ffs .",
    "for @xmath98 at the leading order in pqcd and up to twist-3 , for the longitudinal components , we obtain @xmath99 here , for brevity and clarity , we omit the superscript @xmath100 in the fragmentation functions , e.g. , @xmath101 ; and @xmath102 is the spin of hadron @xmath96 .",
    "the factor @xmath103 appears here because , in the conventions used in  @xcite in defining ffs via quark - quark correlator and/or quark - gluon - quark correlator , @xmath34 is the number density for the produced @xmath96 averaging over rather than summing over the spin of @xmath96 .",
    "we write this factor explicitly so that the corresponding expressions eventually take the same form for spin-1/2 as well as spin-1 hadrons . for the transverse components , we have , @xmath104 where @xmath105 , and we also define , @xmath106 we recall that @xmath107 is @xmath108-even and naive @xmath109-odd , @xmath110 is @xmath108-odd and naive @xmath109-even , and @xmath111 is @xmath108-odd and naive @xmath109-odd .",
    "we emphasize that formally vector polarization components such as @xmath112 , @xmath110 and @xmath113 have exactly the same expressions in terms of ffs for spin-1/2 hadrons or vector mesons .",
    "this means that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : zlambda ] ) and ( [ eq : zstx]-[eq : zsty ] ) are the same for hyperons and for vector mesons .",
    "they are just given by the corresponding ffs for specified hadrons .",
    "the spin alignment of the vector meson is measured by the @xmath114-component @xmath115 of the spin density matrix @xmath8 in the helicity base .",
    "it is directly related to @xmath116 by @xmath117 , which means @xmath118    we consider the case of integrated over @xmath43 or @xmath66 , and we have @xmath119    we see that at the leading twist , we have only two non - zero components , i.e. the longitudinal polarization @xmath120 and @xmath121 . the transverse polarization exists at twist-3 , i.e. , it is power suppressed .",
    "we also note that there is no twist-3 contribution to @xmath122 or @xmath116 .",
    "the higher twist corrections to these two components come only from twist-4 or even higher twists  @xcite .      at different energies ,",
    "we need to consider contributions from @xmath98 , those from @xmath123 and those from the interference terms .",
    "for the longitudinal components , we have @xmath124 and for the transverse components @xmath125 where @xmath79 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : wqy ] ) , and @xmath126 and @xmath127 are given by @xmath128 after integrating over @xmath66 , we obtain @xmath129 where @xmath130 , and @xmath131 .",
    "we see again that there exist twist-3 transverse polarizations that can be used to study higher twist effects in particular the corresponding higher twist ffs .",
    "however , we should also note that at lower energies where electromagnetic interactions dominate , such twist-3 contributions are non - zero only at a given @xmath66 but vanish after the integration over @xmath66 or @xmath43 in the entire region .",
    "this is consistent with the data available  @xcite .",
    "one can however study such effects by measuring transverse polarizations integrated in a given region of @xmath43 or @xmath66 such as in the forward or backward hemisphere .",
    "qcd evolutions for leading twist ffs have been well established and are determined by corresponding dglap equations  @xcite with time - like splitting functions  @xcite . we just give the equations that will be used in our numerical estimations in the following .",
    "the evolution of the spin transfer @xmath32 is given by dglap in the longitudinally polarized case while that for the @xmath26-dependent ff @xmath132 is the same as that for unpolarized ff @xmath133 .",
    "they are given by @xmath134 where @xmath135 or @xmath136 denotes different types of partons such as different flavors of quarks , anti - quarks and gluon .",

    "we therefore limit ourselves to the @xmath0 data and to the next - to - leading order in pqcd where only leading order splitting functions given above are used .",
    "in this section , we use @xmath141 and @xmath142 as representive examples and present the numerical results on the energy dependences .",
    "we choose them as examples since we have data for them from lep  @xcite .      because of decay contributions , polarization of @xmath2 hyperon is much more involved than other hyperons and/or vector mesons .",
    "in general , the leading twist ff for a quark to a baryon , @xmath143 , can be written as the sum of a direct fragmentation and a decay contribution part , i.e. , @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the decay branch ratio of @xmath146 , @xmath147 is the probability for a @xmath148 with @xmath149 to decay into a @xmath150 with @xmath151 , and @xmath152 is the spin transfer factor in the decay process .",
    "numerical results show that , for the @xmath2 hyperon , the contributions from @xmath153 and @xmath154 are sizable  @xcite . however , since there is no suitable data for @xmath153 or @xmath7 polarization in @xmath0 available yet , it is impossible to make such a detailed analysis . on the other hand , the energy dependences of the hadron polarizations that we will study in this paper",
    "come mainly from the qcd evolution of ffs and the energy dependence of the polarization of the quark produced at the @xmath0-annihilation vertex .",
    "we would expect that the influences from the decay contributions on the energy dependence are not very large .",

    "[ fig : fit_lambda ] and [ fig : fit_spinalignment ] , we see clearly that there is a strong energy dependence for @xmath141 , whereas that for @xmath142 is quite weak . the former comes mainly from the energy dependence of @xmath5 while the latter comes mainly from qcd evolution of ffs . to show this more explicitly , we plot @xmath141 at a given @xmath151 as a function of @xmath177 in the same figure as @xmath90 in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_dep ] .     polarization in @xmath0 annihilation.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    from fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_dep ] , we explicitly see that @xmath141 behaves in very much the same way as @xmath5 as functions of @xmath177 .",
    "this show clearly that the energy dependence of @xmath141 is dominated by that of @xmath5 .",
    "we see in particular that , just as @xmath90 , @xmath201 changes very fast with energy and goes to zero when @xmath177 deviates from @xmath169 for @xmath202 .",
    "this is because at smaller @xmath177 , electromagnetic interaction becomes dominant and weak interaction via exchange of @xmath9-boson becomes negligible rapidly . whereas at large @xmath177 , although smaller than that at the @xmath9-pole , it is still sizable and becomes quite flat with increasing @xmath177 .",
    "the results show in particular that at bes or belle energies , @xmath141 should be negligibly small .",
    "furthermore , from the results presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : hp_energy ] such as eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lambda]-[eq : slty ] ) , we see that there is no twist-3 contribution to @xmath141 but there can be twist-3 contribution to the transverse components .",
    "higher twist contributions to @xmath141 come only from twist-4 or even higher twist  @xcite .",
    "this implies that at bes energies , the transverse components could even become larger than the longitudinal component for a given region of @xmath43 or @xmath66 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath141 , @xmath115 changes with @xmath177 quite weakly and remains sizable even at bes energies .",
    "this is a clear prediction that can be tested by future experiments .",
    "using the longitudinal polarization @xmath141 of @xmath2 hyperon and the spin alignment @xmath189 of @xmath203 as representative examples , we demonstrate the two very different behaviors in energy dependences of hadron polarizations in @xmath0 annihilations .",
    "the results show clearly that @xmath141 has a very strong energy dependence due to its direct dependence on the initial longitudinal polarization @xmath5 of the quark @xmath78 , while @xmath189 has a rather weak energy dependence since it is independent of @xmath5 .",
    "the former is dominated by the energy dependence of @xmath5 while the latter comes mainly from the qcd evolutions of the ffs .",
    "we have presented the results at the leading twist with pqcd evolution at the leading order . in view that the measurements of both @xmath141 and @xmath189 can in principle be easily carried out in experiments at bes or belle , we think that this provides a good place to test qcd evolutions of ffs and/or to check whether higher twist effects are important .",
