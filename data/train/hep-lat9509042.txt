    "chiral symmetric strongly coupled lattice gauge theories with fermion and scalar matter fields , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , contain unconfined fermions @xmath4 .",
    "their mass @xmath5 is generated dynamically in the phase with chiral symmetry breaking @xcite and such models can thus be considered as an alternative to the standard higgs - yukawa mechanism of fermion mass generation , provided they are nonperturbatively renormalizable @xcite . here",
    "we consider a 2d model of this type with continuous chiral symmetry , the @xmath6 model , which in the strong coupling limit is equivalent to the chiral gn@xmath0 model .",
    "the observed scaling properties at large but finite gauge coupling indicate that the @xmath1 model belongs also here to the universality class of the gn@xmath0 model .",
    "this would mean that the model is renormalizable and that the shielded gauge mechanism of fermion mass generation , proposed in @xcite , works in 2d .",
    "a similar problem in 4d is addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite and in these proceedings @xcite .",
    "the action of the @xmath1 model consists of three parts : @xmath7 where @xmath8 here @xmath2 is a staggered fermion field with charge one , @xmath9 u(1 ) is a compact abelian gauge field with coupling @xmath10 and @xmath3 is a complex scalar field with charge one and constraint @xmath11 .",
    "the mass term is introduced for technical reasons and the model is meant in the limit @xmath12 , where the action has a global u(1 ) chiral symmetry .    in the limiting case @xmath13",
    "one can perform the lee - shrock - transformation @xcite in which the scalar and gauge fields are integrated out and a four fermion term appears .",
    "this leads to the following action ( @xmath14 ) : @xmath15 \\biggr ) \\nonumber\\\\    & & + \\underbrace{\\frac{am_0}{r}}_{\\displaystyle am'_0 } \\sum_x    \\bar{\\chi}_x\\chi_x   \\;. \\label{wirk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the four fermion coupling @xmath16 is a function of @xmath17 which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . the transformed action ( [ wirk ] ) for @xmath18 is that of the chiral gn@xmath19 model .",
    "this model has a critical point at @xmath20 , where the fermion mass vanishes as @xmath21",
    "we first verified the predicted scaling law ( [ scal ] ) at @xmath23 .",
    "for @xmath18 the simulation is possible only for small lattices ( @xmath24 ) because of the slow convergence of the fermion matrix inversion .",
    "hence we ` somehow ' had to extrapolate the masses measured at @xmath25 to @xmath18 .",
    "it turned out that all examined schemes which tried to extrapolate for fixed @xmath17 to @xmath18 failed . but to perform the continuum limit @xmath26 it is not necessary to set @xmath18 first .",
    "also a combined limit @xmath27 and @xmath28 can lead to a continuum theory without bare mass .",
    "therefore we looked for a scaling law , in which @xmath25 is allowed for finite @xmath17 but @xmath28 when @xmath26 .",
    "such a generalized scaling law is provided by the sd - equations for the model ( [ wirk ] ) truncated to order @xmath29 @xcite : @xmath30 @xmath31 these two coupled equations for functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , were solved numerically @xcite . for infinite volume and small @xmath35",
    "their approximate analytic solution is @xmath36 for @xmath18 one obtains the scaling behavior ( [ scal ] ) as @xmath37 .",
    "the idea of the combined limit @xmath26 and @xmath38 is to make @xmath39 a function of @xmath17 in such a way , that eq .",
    "( [ eq : n ] ) is solvable and that @xmath40 .",
    "we choose ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) @xmath41 with a free parameter @xmath42 obeying @xmath43 .",
    "the generalized scaling law is then @xmath44 and thus @xmath45 obviously , the ratio @xmath46 does not vanish except if @xmath47 .",
    "[ fig:3 ] shows , up to the factor @xmath48 which approaches 1 when @xmath37 , the ratio of the measured fermion mass and the bare mass plotted against @xmath49 . in this ratio the bare part @xmath50 of the fermion mass",
    "is ` divided out ' .",
    "calculations have been performed for @xmath51 .",
    "it turned out to be very difficult to obtain sufficient data for larger values of @xmath42 , as much larger lattices would be needed .",
    "the full lines show the corresponding ratio calculated using the sd - equations for finite lattice and those @xmath25 given by ( [ gl5.1 ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ gl5.3 ] ) is represented by horizontal dashed lines .",
    "good agreement can be observed , especially for not too small @xmath50 and not too large @xmath35 .",
    "_ thus at @xmath13 we have a suitable analytic description of the scaling behavior of the measured fermion mass , at least in the interval @xmath52 . _",
    "_ but how can the data be described for @xmath54 ? _ fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] shows the same ratio , but for masses measured at @xmath55 . as expected , at the same @xmath35 value the fermion masses are in general smaller than those for @xmath13 , as the gauge coupling becomes smaller",
    "this is seen by comparison of the data with the dotted lines which indicate the ratios calculated by the sd - equations at @xmath13 .",
    "the data suggest a simple modification of the scaling behavior at @xmath53 with respect to @xmath22 . indeed , we have found that a good agreement between the measured data and the sd - equations can be obtained when in these equations the parameter @xmath42 is replaced by a fitted value @xmath56 .",
    "the full lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] show the calculated ratio using the sd - equations ( [ sdn],[sdf ] ) with a bare mass which is given by ( [ gl5.1 ] ) but using @xmath56 instead of @xmath42 .",
    "the scaling law for @xmath54 corresponding to equations ( [ gl5.3 ] ) and ( [ gl5.1 ] ) when using @xmath56 is : @xmath58 with @xmath59 for the examined interval @xmath52 we thus observe the same scaling law for @xmath54 as that for @xmath22 apart from the @xmath35-independent factor @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "_ thus we found some evidence that the @xmath1 model for @xmath62 and @xmath50 finite but approaching zero belongs to the same universality class as the gn@xmath19 model with similar bare mass . _",
    "a method of extrapolating to the @xmath18 @xmath63 limit has not yet been found , however .",
    "a calculation of @xmath65 for @xmath66 is very difficult because of its low values , and we could not study its scaling behavior any more . but looking at some bulk observables and bosonic masses , we found no indication that the properties of the @xmath1 model substantially change when @xmath67 is increased .",
    "we also found that the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) phase transition occuring at @xmath68 , when the @xmath1 model reduces to the xy@xmath0 model and decoupled fermions , gets weaker and dissolves at some finite @xmath67 when @xmath67 is increased .",
    "this remnant of the kt phase transition does not influence the fermion mass in an appreciable way .",
    "these observations suggest that the scaling behaviour of @xmath65 is the same at small and large @xmath67 , and that only the magnitude of @xmath65 decreases with increasing @xmath67 .",
    "the continuum limit is approached at any @xmath69 by turning @xmath26 .",
    "if both above hypothetical extensions of our results are correct , then the @xmath1 model belongs to the universality class of th gn@xmath0 model at all @xmath69 and is thus a renormalizable field theory in which the mass of an unconfined fermion is generated dynamically .",
    "it is thus an example of the shielded gauge mechanisme proposed in @xcite ."
