    "effective field theories ( eft s ) and asymptotic expansions have become standard tools in the description of the radiative decay of bound states . their success lies on their ability to select the relevant dynamics in the different kinematic regions defined by the relative size of the radiated photon energy as compared to the bound state mass .",
    "methods based on the use of operator product expansions and effective lagrangians do not only provide more efficient ways to perform the computations but also allow to extract physical interpretations which may go unnoticed in a full theory approach .",
    "apart from being of physical relevance in itself , the positronium system provides a testing ground for the eft concepts and techniques devised in the study of radiative decay amplitudes , that could eventually be applied to the description of the more intricate radiative decays of quarkonia . in this paper",
    "we illustrate which are the characteristic features of the radiative decay spectrum when the energy of the photon lies in the soft - energy region ( @xmath1 ) through the study of the @xmath4 annihilation amplitude of the positronium spin triplet ground state ( orthopositronium : o - ps ) .",
    "the soft - energy region is accessible in the o - ps@xmath5 decay because one of the final state photons can have an arbitrarily small energy , the other two being hard photons with energy @xmath6 .",
    "the process can be then viewed as the radiative version of the o - ps@xmath7 decay .    in a previous paper  @xcite the o - ps differential decay spectrum",
    "was calculated in the region where the photon energy is comparable to the positronium binding energy , @xmath8 .",
    "binding effects were included for the first time in the ps structure function using non - relativistic qed ( nrqed )  @xcite , and it was found that they are essential to reach agreement with the low s theorem prediction for the @xmath9 behaviour of this decay  @xcite . only the leading term in the multipole expansion of the radiated photon field ( dipole approximation ) was required for the calculation , in accordance with the nrqed velocity counting rules for photons with @xmath8  @xcite . based on general considerations about the power - counting of higher - order multipoles in the non - relativistic description of the o - ps decay process , it was then argued by voloshin  @xcite that the dipole approximation used for photon energies @xmath8 should also hold for a description of the o - ps photon spectrum in the whole range @xmath10 , thus enlarging the validity region of the formula given in ref .  @xcite . in particular , it was shown by voloshin that the expansion of the above - mentioned formula in the region @xmath11 is actually a series in @xmath12 rather than in integer powers of @xmath13 .",
    "the origin of such unnatural expansion has to be traced back to the fact that the main contribution in the eft calculation arises from distances in the @xmath0 system of order @xmath14 , that are much smaller than the size of the ps atom @xmath15 .",
    "translated into momentum space , this implies that there is a kinematic region where the relative 3-momentum of the non - relativistic @xmath0 pair obeys the non - relativistic relation @xmath16 .",
    "this scaling does not correspond to any of the known modes that have been identified in the common applications of non - relativistic eft s , and should be compared to the scaling of the familiar potential modes , @xmath17 , characteristic of the heavy particles that form the bound state , and that of the soft modes , @xmath18 .    in view of these novel features , it is worth questioning if the non - relativistic eft framework devised to describe the o - ps decay for @xmath8 in ref .",
    "@xcite also provides the proper expansion when extended to the whole @xmath10 region , as advocated by voloshin .",
    "it is the main purpose of this work to confirm that this is indeed the case by comparing the analytic results for the eft and full qed spectrum in the @xmath1 region , where , as we argue , the usual perturbative qed expansion can already be applied .",
    "such comparison has become feasible after a recent evaluation of the 1-loop qed o - ps@xmath5 phase - space distribution  @xcite , that we use to determine the qed spectrum for soft photon energies .",
    "the agreement between both computations shows that the soft - energy region provides a regime where the eft and the perturbative qed calculations can have a smooth matching .",
    "moreover , we shall confirm by explicitly computing the o - ps@xmath5 decay spectrum in nrqed beyond the dipole approximation that the @xmath19 suppression advocated by voloshin for the higher - order multipoles is of application in the soft - energy region .",
    "it is also the aim of this work to show that the momentum scale @xmath20 that rules the behaviour of the corrections to the nrqed o - ps decay amplitude , corresponds to a new loop - momentum region that has to be taken into account for a successful application of the threshold expansion method  @xcite to qed and qcd loop diagrams involving a particle - antiparticle system decaying through the emission of a soft photon . in the conventional loop expansion ,",
    "soft photon radiation from a heavy particle - antiparticle system introduces a soft energy component @xmath1 in the zero component of the heavy particle momenta .",
    "non - relativistic poles in massive propagators of the form @xmath21 can be thus found in these loops , giving rise to a contribution from the loop - momentum region @xmath20 .",
    "it is a well - known fact that momentum regions that have not been considered previously may become relevant for some kinematic configurations or at higher loop order in the asymptotic expansion of integrals based on the  method of regions \"  @xcite , and looking for missing regions is a required task in order to check the robustness of the method .",
    "likewise , it is of conceptual importance to understand the role of this new momentum scale in the eft frameworks that describe the radiative decays of heavy particle - antiparticle systems in the soft - energy region , which we discuss in this paper .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nrqed ] we detail the eft calculation of the o - ps@xmath5 decay amplitude without multipole expanding the electromagnetic interaction . we also show how relativistic corrections that contribute to the decay amplitude in the whole photon energy range @xmath10 can be accommodated in the eft framework .",
    "in particular , the recoil of the intermediate virtual @xmath0 pair , which yields also an @xmath22 correction , is included in our calculation . in sec .  [ sec : qed ] we perform the @xmath9 limit of the 1-loop qed spectrum directly from the 1-loop phase - space distribution computed recently by adkins  @xcite .",
    "the 1-loop qed amplitude in this regime is also obtained with the asymptotic expansion of the graphs near threshold in sec .  [",
    "sec : threshold ] .",
    "a discussion on the eft description of the new loop - momentum region found is postponed to the end of the latter section . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : quarkonium ] we suggest the use of the threshold expansion within the nrqcd factorization framework to compute the short - distance coefficients in quarkonium radiative decays at soft energies .",
    "the appendix  [ sec : appen1 ] collects the exact formulas for the multipole calculation of the nrqed spectrum , while appendix  [ sec : appen2 ] shows another example of the asymptotic expansion method applied to a radiative amplitude .",
    "the nrqed framework used in ref .",
    "@xcite provides a systematic way to compute bound state effects in the the o - ps decay spectrum when the photon energy is much smaller than the electron mass .",
    "contrary to the usual relativistic approach where the 3-photon annihilation is considered to take place at very short distances as compared to the range of the electromagnetic binding force between @xmath0 , the non - relativistic description takes into account that there is a long - distance part in the o - ps decay process when one the photons in the final state is not hard ( @xmath24 ) . in the latter case",
    ", the decay proceeds in two steps : the low - energy photon is first radiated from the bound state , making a transition from the c - odd ground state o - ps ( @xmath25 ) to a c - even positronium state , which subsequently decays into two photons ( see the eft graph of fig .  [",
    "fig : nrqedgraphs]a ) .",
    "the decay amplitude of the intermediate c - even @xmath0 state has no long - distance contribution , since both photons must be hard .",
    "the emission of the low energy photon from o - ps is described by the coulomb hamiltonian of the @xmath0 system in interaction with a quantized electromagnetic field : @xmath26 h_0&=&\\frac{\\mathbf{p}^2}{4m}+h_c \\;\\;,\\;\\ ; h_c = \\frac{\\mathbf{p}^2}{m } -\\frac{\\alpha}{r } \\ , , { \\nonumber}\\\\[2mm]h_{\\text{int } } & = & - { e \\over m}\\ , \\mathbf{p}_1\\cdot \\mathbf{a}(\\mathbf{x}_1 ) + { e \\over m}\\ , \\mathbf{p}_2\\cdot \\mathbf{a}(\\mathbf{x}_2 ) -\\mu\\;\\bm{\\sigma}_{\\phi}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}(\\mathbf{x}_1)- \\mu\\;\\bm{\\sigma}_{\\chi}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}(\\mathbf{x}_2 ) \\ , , \\label{1.1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the center of mass variables ( @xmath27 ) @xmath28 with the subindices @xmath29 referring to the electron and the positron , respectively , and @xmath30 being the pauli matrices acting on the electron and positron spinors ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the terms shown in the hamiltonian @xmath32 are the leading ones in the non - relativistic expansion .",
    "relativistic effects can be included through higher dimensional operators suppressed by powers of @xmath33 ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) , but will not be needed for the purposes of this work .    since the computation of the photon spectrum in ref .",
    "@xcite was intended for photon energies comparable to the positronium binding energy , @xmath8 , the interaction hamiltonian was used in the dipole approximation limit .",
    "this approximation amounts to evaluating the vector potential @xmath34 in the center of mass of the positronium system ( _ i.e. _ at @xmath35 ) , which is fully legitimate for radiated photons with wavelengths much larger than the characteristic size of the positronium atom ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "higher order multipoles arise as a taylor series in the relative coordinate @xmath37 and are suppressed by powers of @xmath38 under the assumption that the relevant amplitudes one has to compute involve integrations to spatial extents of order @xmath39 . for photons with larger energies , @xmath40",
    ", this premise will invalidate the use of the multipole expansion .    however , in the case of the o - ps system that undergoes a radiative transition before decaying , and as it has been properly pointed out by voloshin  @xcite , the scale @xmath41 does not constraint the maximum photon energy for which we can apply the multipole expansion .",
    "the reason is that after the soft photon is radiated we have to consider all possible @xmath0 intermediate states with the right quantum numbers .",
    "the propagation of these @xmath0 states is described by the green s function obtained from the hamiltonian @xmath42 , @xmath43 at energy @xmath44 ( see eq .",
    "( [ 1.8 ] ) below ) .",
    "since the annihilation of the intermediate @xmath0 pair into two photons takes place at small distances , the amplitude for the full process is thus given by a convolution of the o - ps ground state and the green s function .",
    "in coordinate space , the green s function has a characteristic size ruled by the exponential factor @xmath45 .",
    "we note that for soft photons of energy @xmath11 , this exponential factor constrains the relevant integration region to distances of order @xmath46 , much smaller than the spatial extent of the initial positronium atom .",
    "therefore , the characteristic distance that enters in the multipole expansion of the soft - photon emission in the o - ps@xmath5 decay amplitude is determined by the falloff of the intermediate green s function rather than by the size of the ps atom , so the series of multipoles is actually an expansion in powers of @xmath47 which can be used as long as @xmath10 .",
    "note also that for the intermediate pair , an iterative computation of the coulomb green s function , @xmath48 , with @xmath49 the free green s function , shows that adding a coulomb exchange generates a term @xmath50 as @xmath51 .",
    "therefore the coulomb interaction can be treated perturbatively in the virtual @xmath0 system after soft photon radiation .",
