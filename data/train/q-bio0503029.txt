    "unraveling the complexity of the energy landscape of rna molecules requires exploration of their assembly and unfolding over a wide range of external conditions . in the last decade a combination of experiments , theoretical arguments , and simulations have been used to decipher the folding mechanisms of rna molecules @xcite .",
    "these studies have shown that rna folding depends critically on a number of factors including valence and shape of counterions @xcite , and temperature .",
    "somewhat more surprisingly recent experiments have shown that the folding mechanisms depend sensitively on the initial folding conditions @xcite . in conventional experiments",
    "the difficult - to - characterize unfolded conformations are typically generated by altering temperature or by lowering the counterion concentration .",
    "in contrast , well - defined and vastly different initial conditions can be realized by applying force .",
    "indeed , in remarkable experiments bustamante and coworkers @xcite have generated mechanical unfolding trajectories for rna hairpins and _ t. thermophila _ ribozyme .",
    "these experiments , which use constant external force to denature folded rna , show that unfolding involves multiple routes in which a number of kinetic intermediates are sampled in the transition from the folded state to a stretched conformation @xcite .",
    "the lifetimes of the intermediates vary considerably , which is indicative of the large dispersion in the unfolding pathways .",
    "thus , force unfolding is a powerful method to probe , at the single molecule level , regions of the energy landscape that are _ inaccessible in conventional folding experiments_. in addition , to the importance of these experiments to map the rna folding landscape response of rna to locally applied force may also be relevant in understanding cellular processes such as mrna translocation through ribosomes , viral replication , and enzymatic activity of rna dependent rna polymerases .    in the force - induced unfolding experiments mechanical force , @xmath1 ,",
    "was applied using optical tweezers either to a part or to the whole _",
    "ribozyme assembly in differing ionic conditions . in their first report liphardt _",
    "@xcite showed that a simple hairpin , three helix junction , and the p5abc subdomain of the _ tetrahymena _ ribozyme can fold reversibly when subject to a constant force . at the transition force the systems hop between folded and unfolded states . assuming that the system is ergodic the dynamics of the reversible folding was used to calculate force - dependent equilibrium properties of the rna constructs .",
    "these experiments established that @xmath1 @xmath2a new variable to initiate unfolding@xmath2 is a viable way to measure free energy difference between folded and unfolded states and to locate transition states with the mean extension of the molecule as a reaction coordinate .",
    "mechanical unfolding experiments on rna have already lead to a number of theoretical studies @xcite that have addressed different aspects of forced - unfolding .",
    "inspired by these experiments and building on previous theoretical works we report here the results for forced - unfolding of a small rna hairpin using coarse - grained off - lattice simulations under varying forces and temperatures .",
    "we choose small hairpins for the preliminary study because they undergo reversible folding under force and they represent a basic subunit of large rna assemblies .",
    "we address the following questions : ( 1 ) what are the forced - unfolding pathways and how they differ from thermal denaturation ? ( 2 ) how do the diagram of states change as @xmath3 and @xmath1 are varied ?",
    "( 3 ) what are the differences in the time scales and pathways in force quench refolding and thermal refolding ?",
    "we find that , just as in proteins @xcite , forced - unfolding occurs in quantized steps whereas the thermal unfolding is stochastic . even for the simple hairpin we find a well - defined equilibrium phase diagram in the ( @xmath0 ) plane in which hairpin states are separated by a phase boundary from the unfolded states .",
    "surprisingly , when refolding is initiated by quenching to zero force from high forces , the folding occurs in _ multiple stages with the initial compaction being nearly continuous_. remarkably , the refolding under force quench is nearly an order of magnitude greater than thermal refolding time .",
    "* hairpin sequence : * we have studied the thermal and forced - unfolding of a 22-nucleotide hairpin , p5ga , that is similar to p5ab in the p5abc domain of group i intron .",
    "both these structures have ga mismatches and are characterized by the presence of gaaa tetraloop .",
    "the sequence of p5ga is ggcgaagucgaaagauggcgcc and its nmr structure has been determined @xcite ( pdb id:1eor ) . + * model : * building on our previous studies on proteins @xcite we introduce a coarse - grained off - lattice model of rna by representing each nucleotide by three beads with interaction sites corresponding to phosphate group ( p ) , ribose group ( s ) , and the base ( b ) ( fig.[coarse_nucl]-a ) . in this model",
    "the rna backbone is reduced to the polymeric structure @xmath4 and the base is covalently linked to the ribose center .",
    "thus , a rna molecule with n nucleotides corresponds to 3n interaction centers .",
    "the potential energy of a conformation is written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 the stretching potential between covalently connected moieties accounts for chain connectivity .",
    "the angular degrees of freedom are described by the bond angle potential , @xmath7 , and the dihedral angle term @xmath8 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use a go model in which interactions in the native structure are attractive while all other interactions are repulsive .",
    "simple rna secondary structures are stabilized largely by stacking interactions whose context dependent values are known @xcite . in the native state",
    "the p5ga hairpin has nine hydrogen bonds between the base pairs including two ga mismatch pairs @xcite .",

    "we take @xmath30 and @xmath31 from turner s thermodynamic data set @xcite .",
    "there are no estimates for ga related stacking interactions , which typically do not form a stable bond and hence is considered a mismatch . because of the absence of stacking parameters for the ga pair , we use the energy associated with gu in place of ga .    to mimic the hydrophobicity of purine / pyrimidine group , we use the lennard - jones ( lj ) interactions between non - bonded interaction centers .",

    "we assume debye - hckel interaction , which accounts for screening by condensed counterions and hydration effects , and is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the charge on the phosphate ion , @xmath52 and the debye length @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "to calculate the ionic strength @xmath55 , we use the value @xmath56-@xmath57 from the header of pdb file @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath58 in the simulation @xcite . because the debye screening length @xmath59 the strength of electrostatic interaction between the phosphate group is temperature dependent even when we ignore the variations of @xmath60 with @xmath3 . at room temperature ( @xmath61 ) the electrostatic repulsion between the phosphate groups at @xmath625.8 , which is the closest distance between phosphate groups , is @xmath63 .",

    "( 4 ) remarkably , refolding times by force quench are much greater than folding initiated by temperature quench .",
