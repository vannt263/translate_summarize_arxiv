    "finite order invariants of immersions of a closed orientable surface into @xmath0 have been introduced in o , where all order 1 invariants have been classified .",
    "explicit formulae for the majority of order 1 invariants have been given in a , f . all higher order invariants have been classified in h , and the analogue of all the above for non - orientable surfaces has appeared in n. a first step in the study of finite order invariants of immersions of surfaces into general 3-manifolds appears in q where one specific order 1 invariant has been studied .    in the present work we study finite order invariants of null - homotopic immersions of a closed orientable surface @xmath1 into an aspherical orientable 3-manifold @xmath2 .",
    "the immersions being null - homotopic will enable us to lift the immersions to the universal covering @xmath3 of @xmath2 , and @xmath2 being aspherical will guarantee a simple form for @xmath4 for discrete subset @xmath5 .",
    "we develop the foundations for the study of finite order invariants in our setting , as has been done in o for the case @xmath6 ( and analogous to chord diagrams and the 1-term and 4-term relations in knot theory ) .",

    "a 2-parameter family may be constructed by fixing three of the planes , and allowing the other two planes to move parallel to themselves .",
    "a loop in the shape of a rectangle around the origin of the parameter plane may be constructed as follows : the three fixed planes @xmath293 intersect in a triple point @xmath17 .",

    "similarly @xmath314 are nonzero . by rotating the configuration around the @xmath315 axis we may assume @xmath316 .",
    "we claim that we must then get also @xmath317 .",

    "( if @xmath325 then there is no intersection , which implies that the three planes are not in general position . ) in the same way @xmath326 , using @xmath327 . and so the simplex @xmath328 created from the passage of @xmath295 across @xmath20 ( bounded by the planes @xmath329 ) , lies in the octant @xmath330 , whereas the simplex @xmath331 that is about to vanish when @xmath295 arrives at @xmath53 ( bounded by the planes @xmath332 ) , lies in the octant @xmath333 which is the exact opposite octant . and",
    "so the sign @xmath122 with which each of the common planes @xmath334 appears in @xmath328 and @xmath331 is the opposite sign .",
    "but since we have co - oriented all quadruple points according to our direction of motion , the simplex @xmath331 is not the one with which we determine the signs for the symbol @xmath335 of the quadruple point at @xmath53 , but rather the simplex @xmath336 which will be created _",
    "after _ we cross @xmath53 .",
    "as we have already noticed , the signs of the faces for @xmath336 are all opposite to the corresponding signs for @xmath331 , and so finally the common planes with @xmath328 will have the same sign as in @xmath328 .",
    "we apply a similar two step argument to determine the relation between the orderings of the faces in the two symbols @xmath337 .",
    "we note that if some ordering of the faces of @xmath328 is consistent with the orientation of @xmath328 ( restricted from @xmath0 ) then the ordering for the faces of @xmath331 obtained by simply replacing the plane @xmath308 with the plane @xmath309 is _",
    "_ in__consistent with the orientation of @xmath331 . and so this same ordering of these same four planes , now considered as the faces of @xmath336 , _ is _ consistent with the orientation of @xmath336 . and",
    "so for the superscripts of two consecutive symbols we finally get , that the @xmath134 corresponding to the plane which appears only in the first quadruple point and not the second ( the plane @xmath308 in our case ) should be dropped , and exactly in its place should be written the @xmath134 corresponding to the new plane which participates in the second quadruple point but not in the first ( the plane @xmath309 in our case ) .",
    "the three @xmath134s corresponding to the three common planes ( the planes @xmath338 in our case ) must remain in their place , and with the signs @xmath122 unchanged .",
    "we now show that when passing from the last quadruple point of a long edge to the quadruple point of the next short edge , or from that to the first quadruple point of the next long edge , then the same relation holds .",
    "indeed , looking say at the first and second quadruple point in our rectangle described above , let @xmath339 be the triple point of @xmath297 which @xmath295 passes first along the long edge , for the occurrence of the second quadruple point .",
    "let @xmath340 be one of the planes @xmath298 such that if @xmath340 is moved in the direction such that @xmath297 increases in size , then the point @xmath339 will move toward @xmath295 and eventually cross it .",
    "so we can start from the same initial position as before , but instead of moving @xmath294 and then @xmath295 , we move only plane @xmath340 , such that @xmath296 will vanish , passing the first quadruple point , @xmath297 is created and increases in size until @xmath339 crosses @xmath295 thus passing the second quadruple point .",
    "so we have obtained the same two quadruple points , where now four of the planes are fixed and only the plane @xmath340 is in motion . but",
    "this is precisely the motion analyzed above to obtain the relation between two consecutive quadruple points along a long edge .",
    "finally it remains to determine the degrees @xmath123}}$ ] of the ten symbols .",
    "we do this again by analyzing the relation between the degrees of two consecutive quadruple points . following the intersection point between @xmath341 as it continuously moves up from @xmath20 to @xmath53 , we see that there is no change in the degree due to these three planes .",
    "( recall that the labeling is locally constant above the region of interest . )",
    "there may , on the other hand , be a change due to the planes @xmath342 and @xmath343 .",
    "if the preferred side of @xmath344 is facing upward , which happens iff the corresponding sign @xmath345 appearing in the symbol @xmath346 for the first quadruple point is @xmath192 , then when computing the degree @xmath347 for the first quadruple point , @xmath344 is slight pushed upward so as to pass above the point @xmath20 . but as @xmath295 moves upward to @xmath53 , @xmath344 does not participate in the second quadruple point , and remains below the point @xmath53 which is where the degree is now computed . so in this case there is a change of @xmath348 to the degree due to the plane @xmath344 .",
    "if on the other hand the plane @xmath344 is facing downward , which happens iff the sign @xmath345 appearing in @xmath346 is @xmath191 , then the plane @xmath344 is pushed _ downward _ when @xmath347 is computed , and again it will remain below the point @xmath53 when the degree of the second quadruple is computed , and so there will be no change in the degree due to @xmath344 .",
    "the two cases may be written in one formula as follows . for sign @xmath349 ,",
    "define @xmath350 then the change in degree between the first and second quadruple point , due to the plane @xmath344 is @xmath351 . a similar analysis as to the effect of the plane @xmath352 on the degree",
    "will give @xmath353 .",
    "together we get that if @xmath352 is the plane missing from the first quadruple point , and @xmath344 appears there with sign @xmath345 , and @xmath344 is missing from the second quadruple point , and @xmath352 appears there with sign @xmath122 , then the change in the degree between the first and second quadruple point is @xmath354 .",
    "looking at the circle ( or rectangle ) of ten quadruple points , we see that the same 4-tuple of planes participates in a quadruple point twice , and with opposite co - orientation , and so the ordering of the corresponding @xmath355 at the two times differ by an odd permutation .",
    "they occur at the precise opposite timing along the circle , i.e. five places apart , and so the ordering of quadruple points along the circle is that all five possible 4-tuples appear one after the other , and then they appear again in the same order , to complete the cycle of ten quadruple points .",
    "so given a quadruple point , either it or the matching quadruple point on the opposite side of the circle , have the property , that the ordering of superscripts may be chosen as @xmath136 so that in the next quadruple point the plane corresponding to @xmath356 will be missing , in the following quadruple point the plane corresponding to @xmath357 will be missing , and so on . finally , since the two matching quadruple points ( i.e. those with the same 4-tuple of planes ) occur with opposite co - orientation , the sign attached to each @xmath358 will be opposite ( i.e. @xmath355 is replaced by @xmath359 ) .",
    "since we have seen that if a plane is common to two consecutive quadruple points , it appears in their superscripts with the same sign , and since a given plane will be missing exactly once between its appearance in a given quadruple point , and the occurrence of the matching quadruple point , it follows that whenever a plane is missing from a quadruple point , then it appears in the following quadruple point with opposite sign than it does in the previous one .    to write our final formula , let us choose the first quadruple point and ordering @xmath136 as mentioned above , and",
    "we may write its degree as @xmath360 where @xmath361 corresponds to the plane missing from the first quadruple point , and @xmath362 is the sign with which it will appear in the second quadruple point .",
    "the first symbol is thus @xmath363 , and the combination of all analysis above produces the following equation :    @xmath364    now let @xmath365 be the subgroup consisting of all functions @xmath241 which satisfy the above equations ( 1 )  ( 6 ) together with our first two equations @xmath249 and @xmath250 .",
    "then we have obtained that the image of the injection @xmath366 is contained in @xmath367 .",
    "finding the precise image of @xmath242 for all @xmath93 ( as has been done for the case @xmath6 in o , h ) , would give a full classification of all finite order invariants .",
    "in the next section we will show that the image of @xmath368 is all @xmath369 , by this classifying all order one invariants .",
    "we define a `` universal '' abelian group @xmath370 , by the abelian group presentation which takes as generators the elements of @xmath142 , and as relations , the set of all equations used above to define @xmath367 ( and in particular @xmath369 ) .",
    "note that for defining @xmath369 , an expression such as @xmath249 was merely a short form for writing @xmath371 , this being a condition on an element @xmath372 for being included in the subgroup @xmath369 , whereas , in the definition of @xmath370 , @xmath249 is an actual relation in the presentation of @xmath370 by generators and relations .",
    "we define the universal element @xmath373 , to be the function that assigns to each element in @xmath142 , the generator corresponding to it in @xmath370 . by definition of @xmath370 , indeed @xmath373 .",
    "we will now establish the existence of an order 1 invariant @xmath374 satisfying @xmath375 .",
    "this will prove our desired result , that for any abelian group @xmath223 , @xmath376 is surjective .",
    "indeed , given @xmath377 , there is a ( unique ) homomorphism @xmath378 such that @xmath379 , and we get @xmath380 .",
    "let @xmath148 be some immersion and @xmath383 a null - homotopy from @xmath66 to a constant map @xmath384 with @xmath385 .",
    "using the parallelizibility of @xmath2 we extend @xmath78 to a homotopy of bundle monomorphisms , from @xmath386 to a bundle monomorphism @xmath31 which covers @xmath387 . by the smale - hirsch theorem applied to @xmath388 , there is an immersion @xmath389 with @xmath390 homotopic to @xmath31 as bundle monomorphisms .",
    "now by the smale - hirsch theorem applied to @xmath391 , @xmath66 is regularly homotopic to @xmath392 , and so @xmath381 .",
    "fix an immersion @xmath393 with image contained in a small ball @xmath382 , as provided by lemma b. for any @xmath394 take a generic regular homotopy @xmath162 from @xmath392 to @xmath66 , and to each ce which occurs along @xmath162 choose a proper co - orientation .",
    "let @xmath395 be the sum of the elements in @xmath396 corresponding to the co - oriented ces occurring along @xmath162 , each taken with a sign @xmath397 according to whether @xmath162 passes it in the direction of its co - orientation .",
    "an opposite choice of co - orientation for a ce along @xmath162 ( relevant for types @xmath99 ) , will produce the negative element in @xmath370 , but this element will appear with opposite sign in the sum and so this sum is well defined , for given @xmath162 .",
    "we would like to show that in fact @xmath398 is independent of the regular homotopy @xmath162 , and so @xmath398 is a well defined invariant .",
    "this is equivalent to showing that this sum is 0 along any closed @xmath162 , i.e. @xmath162 such that @xmath399 .",
    "once we know @xmath398 is well defined , it is clear that it is of order 1 , and @xmath375 .",
    "the fact that the sum of values is 0 along any null - homotopic loop follows from the definition of @xmath369 and @xmath370 as demonstrated in o , and so the sum along loops induces a well defined homomorphism @xmath400",
    ". we must show @xmath401 .",
    "fix a disc @xmath402 , and let @xmath403 be given by restriction , @xmath404 . then @xmath199 is a fibration with fiber @xmath405 .",
    "so we get an exact sequence @xmath406 let @xmath407 be the subgroup consisting of loops obtained by composing @xmath408 with a motion of @xmath409 in @xmath2 through embeddings , beginning and ending with the inclusion of @xmath409 in @xmath2 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath410 maps @xmath411 onto @xmath412 , and so the elements of @xmath411 and those coming from @xmath413 generate @xmath414 .",
    "now @xmath415 is 0 on elements of @xmath411 , since no ces occur along such loops , and so it remains to show that @xmath415 is 0 on @xmath413 .",
    "it is shown in the proof of q theorem 3.4 , that @xmath413 is generated by a loop which only moves a small disc @xmath416 which is disjoint from @xmath45 , and @xmath268 moves only within a small ball @xmath417 . in our case",
    "we may take @xmath418 , and so we finally need only to check the value of @xmath415 on loops moving @xmath1 in @xmath409 .",
    "if we take our labeling to be locally constant above @xmath409 , then we can have all lifts used to define our symbols to be contained in the same lift of @xmath409 , constantly labeled by some fixed element @xmath137 . and",
    "so all symbols will be of the form @xmath419 . by a permutation of the superscript , which is even in case @xmath87",
    "is @xmath83 , we may assume that all @xmath191 signs appear first , and so the superscript is characterized only by the _ number _ of @xmath191 signs , which is precisely the way the superscript of a symbol is defined in o for immersions @xmath420 .",
    "the subscript is characterized by the coefficient @xmath421 of @xmath422 which is also simply the degree as defined in o for immersions @xmath423 . and",
    "so @xmath415 being 0 on all loops moving @xmath1 in @xmath409 , follows from the fact that @xmath398 appearing in o for the case @xmath6 , is well defined .",
    "indeed , for @xmath398 of o , the sum of symbols along a loop of immersions in @xmath409 , is 0 in the group @xmath424 of o. we have noticed that our symbols of the form @xmath419 correspond to the symbols of o , but furthermore , any equation on the symbols appearing in o , has a corresponding equation on our symbols of the form @xmath419 , by considering the same codim 2 configuration in @xmath409 . and",
    "so the sum in our present @xmath424 must also be 0 .",
    "this completes the proof of :    let @xmath1 be a closed orientable surface , @xmath2 an aspherical orientable 3-manifold , and @xmath425 a regular homotopy class of null - homotopic immersions of @xmath1 into @xmath2 .",
    "then for any abelian group @xmath223 , the injection @xmath426 is surjective .",
    "we conclude with the following remark .",
    "our classification is in terms of the group @xmath427 which as we have seen is the same as the group @xmath428 . in o",
    "where @xmath6 and so @xmath429 , the structure of @xmath370 is completely understood and accordingly the group of order 1 invariants . in the general case presented here , the structure of @xmath370 depends on the structure of @xmath196 , most notably through the equivalence relation which produces @xmath142 from @xmath430 .",
    "the complexity of this dependence may be seen in the discussion following proposition cab , where the question is whether a given symbol is equivalent to its reversed symbol . and",
    "so a closed explicit classification as in o ( not to mention explicit formulae for the invariants , as in f ) , will require extensive analysis of @xmath196 for any given @xmath2 ."
