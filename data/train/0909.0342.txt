    "fast ignition by laser - driven ion beams has been proposed @xcite as an alternative to the standard scheme of fast ignition by relativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "it offers the advantages of the classical interaction of ion beams with compressed fuels , their much more localized energy deposition , and the stiffer ion transport with the possibility of beam focusing .",
    "proton fast ignition ( pfi ) is a promising option because of the high laser - to - proton conversion efficiencies ( @xmath0 6 - 12% ) found in experiments for maxwellian energy distributions @xcite .",
    "novel target geometries such as flat - top cone targets seem to be appropriate to increase those efficiencies @xcite .",
    "monoenergetic protons may have a better coupling with the compressed core , but the relatively low conversion efficiencies ( @xmath0 1% @xcite ) found so far hamper their application to fast ignition .",
    "studies on pfi have shown that ignition energies can be reduced substantially by using a sequence of two beams @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations show that fuel targets compressed to @xmath1 = 500 g/@xmath2 can be ignited by two maxwellian proton beams with temperature t@xmath3 = 4 mev and a total energy of 8 kj @xcite . assuming a conversion efficiency of 10%",
    ", the required laser energy is about 80 kj , that is of the same order than the energies envisioned for future fast ignition facilities such as hiper ( high power laser energy research ) @xcite .",
    "however , the pfi scheme requires to place the proton source near the compressed fuel inside a re - entrant cone to shield the source from the plasma coming from the imploding shell .",
    "thus , the capsule implosion and fuel compression will be relatively complex due to the flow perturbations induced by the cone .",
    "a complete simulation of an indirectly driven target ignited by laser - driven protons can be found in @xcite .",
    "recently , particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations of the interaction of short pulses of circularly polarized laser light with thin foils at intensities of 10@xmath4 w/@xmath5 have shown that it is possible to accelerate ions up to hundreds of mev with quasimonoenergetic energy distributions and small divergence angles @xcite . in this scheme , that we refer to as rpa ( radiation pressure acceleration ) , the whole foil is accelerated by radiation pressure with laser - to - ion conversion efficiencies around 10% @xcite .",
    "the so - called laser break - out afterburner ( boa ) scheme has been also proposed to generate almost perfectly collimated quasimonoenergetic ions with conversion efficiencies of a few percent @xcite at laser intensities about 10@xmath6 w/@xmath5 .",

    "we assume perfectly collimated cylindrical ion beams of 30 @xmath8 m diameter impinging on a dt blob with a peak density of 500 g/@xmath2 .",
    "recent implosion calculations have shown that it is possible to achieve such high densities in capsules of 0.59 mg of dt with laser energies around 200 kj @xcite .",
    "it is worth recalling that densities higher than 500 g/@xmath2 were obtained in direct - drive implosions conducted by 10 kj laser pulses @xcite .",
    "we consider the two different configurations of the compressed dt shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the first one is a simplification of the configuration obtained from the two - dimensional ( 2d ) implosion calculations of cone - targets presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the second one is similar to that obtained by clark and tabak @xcite from one - dimensional ( 1d ) implosion calculations to get an almost isochoric configuration of the compressed fuel . as shown in ref .",

    "the main differences between the two density distributions shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) and ( b ) are the higher @xmath1r of the plasma surrounding the dense core and the steeper density ramp of the clark & tabak s target .",
    "since the dt plasma is stagnated at the time of peak @xmath9 , we assume that the dt is initially at rest with an uniform temperature of 300 ev , with exception of the central dip of the target shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) , that has an initial temperature around 1 kev to get pressure balance between the hot spark and the dense fuel .",
    "calculations have been performed with the 2-d radiation - hydrodynamics code sara , that includes flux - limited electron conduction , multigroup radiation transport , ion energy deposition , dt fusion reactions and @xmath10-particle transport @xcite .",
    "we validated our simulation model by comparing the ignition energy ( @xmath0 9 kj ) of monoenergetic proton beams impinging on an uniform dt plasma precompressed to 400 g/@xmath2 with that obtained by atzeni et al .",

    "ions come from the left and propagate towards the blob through a low density plasma .",
    "we assume that ions are generated instantaneously with a maxwellian energy distribution for protons and a gaussian energy distribution with a given energy spread for carbon ions .",
    "if the energy spread is 10% ( full width at half - maximum , fwhm ) , we refer to this last distribution as `` quasimonoenergetic '' throughout the paper .",
    "instantaneous emission of the beam ions is assumed because the spread of the time of flight ( @xmath0 10 ps ) from the source to the target is much longer than the typical ion acceleration time ( @xmath0 1 ps ) .",

    "these two distances have been chosen in order to have the same peak power and approximately the same pulse duration on target ( @xmath0 8 ps ) with both beams .",
    "it is worth noting that the almost negligible time spread of ions with quasimonoenergetic energy distributions allows to place the source at much higher distances @xmath7 than maxwellian ions . because beam focalization over distances of a few centimeters may be difficult , a number of focusing techniques",
    "have been proposed over the last years .",

    "ion range increases when plasma electron velocities become comparable to the ion velocity .",
    "this effect is important for ions with maxwellian energy distributions placed far from the fuel : indeed the decrease of ion kinetic energy with time ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) is balanced by their range lengthening as the dt is heated up , keeping the ion range almost constant with time @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "range lengthening may be a disadvantage for quasimonoenergetic ions because their kinetic energy on target has only a small variation with time when compared with maxwellian ions ( see fig .",

    "it is remarkable that these energies are at least 25% higher than those obtained for the target with the super - gaussian density distribution ( see fig .",

    "for instance , the ignition energies for @xmath15 = 0.4 and a distance @xmath7 = 2 cm become higher than 20 kj .",
    "this energy can be reduced by placing the ion source closer to the target .",
    "thus , the ignition energy of 50 mev / u carbon ions with @xmath15 = 0.4 generated at a distance @xmath7 = 0.5 cm turns out to be @xmath39 = 13.5 kj , slightly higher than the 12.5 kj obtained for ions with the same kinetic energy , @xmath15 = 0.1 and @xmath7 = 2 cm . yet , a source - core distance @xmath7 = 0.5 cm is still high enough to use target designs without a re - entrant cone inserted .",

    "fast ignition driven by ions presents several advantages over fast ignition driven by relativistic electrons such as their well know interaction with the plasma , their focusability and the flexibility for the fuel ignition , such as the possibility of using multiple beams .",
