    "not only is this the largest reported black hole mass with a direct measurement , but they remarked that it weighs in at an extraordinary 59% of its host spheroid s stellar mass , and 14% of the galaxy s total stellar mass . to put this in perspective , graham & scott ( 2013 ) reported that the average @xmath26 mass ratio was 0.49% for large spheroids , a result reiterated by kormendy & ho ( 2013 ) , and recently upgraded to 0.68% by savorgnan et al .",

    "( 2015 ) subsequently reported a preferred black hole mass of @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , while scharwchter et al .",
    "( 2015 ) reported a value consistent with @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) based on the kinematics of co(1 - 0 ) emission measured with the iram plateau de bure interferometer at @xmath161-arcsec resolution .",
    "most recently , walsh et al .",
    "( 2015 ) have confirmed the optimal mass derived by emsellem ( 2013 ) , reporting @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "all of these measures still leave a galaxy with an unusually high ( black hole)-to - spheroid mass ratio .",
    "emsellem ( 2013 ) additionally questioned whether the spheroid had been properly identified by van den bosch et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , and he suggested that there may be a spheroid with a mass of @xmath16@xmath37 , or @xmath16@xmath38 within the inner 2 kpc , obtained by summing all of the components of his multi - gaussian photometric expansion ( mge ) model which had an ellipticity less than 0.7 . coupled with his reduced black hole mass , it gave an @xmath26 mass ratio of 35% .",
    "we start our investigation of ngc  1277 by presenting an image analysis and measurement of the physical properties of its spheroidal stellar system .",
    "we perform a decomposition of ngc  1277 based on fundamental galaxy components . knowing the properties of the spheroid , such as its srsic index and stellar mass , not only enables us to determine the _ expected _ black hole mass , but provides some insight into the history of ngc  1277 . as suggested in graham ( 2013 ) and driver et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , the bulges in some of today s massive lenticular galaxies are likely to be the descendents of the compact galaxies seen at high - redshift , and minor mergers will evolve , rather than preserve , the compact high-@xmath39 galaxies . ] .",
    "many have the same small sizes , large masses , and radial concentrations of light  as traced by the srsic index ( dullo & graham 2013 ) . the subsequent accretion and growth of disks ( e.g.  white & rees 1978 ; white & frenk 1991 ) , perhaps from cold gas flows ( e.g.  pichon et al .",
    "2011 ; combes et al .  2014 ) , around the initially compact galaxies would increase their total galaxy size , effectively hiding them  today s massive bulges  in plain sight ( graham , dullo & savorgnan 2015 ) . in ngc  1277 , as in other nearby galaxies like ngc  1332 ( @xmath40 kpc , @xmath41 , savorgnan & graham 2015b ) ,",
    "the disk is small enough that the whole galaxy is still a compact massive galaxy ( see section  [ sec1d ] ) .",
    "accounting for the different structural components in a galaxy can also be important for the direct measurement of the black hole mass , in particular with regard to the influence of disks .",
    "unresolved disk rotation can enhance the observed velocity dispersion within a given resolution element , an issue noted by tonry ( 1984 ) in regard to m32 and by dressler ( 1989 , his section  3 ) in regard to m87 .",
    "such `` velocity shear '' is also known to be an important consideration when dealing with poorly resolved galaxies at large redshift , where rotation can artificially raise the observed velocity dispersion ( e.g.  law et al .",
    "2009 ; green et al .  2014 ) .",
    "as noted in the conclusions of graham et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , exactly the same situation can occur at the centers of nearby galaxies if they possess a ( nearly ) edge - on disk .",
    "given that ngc  1277 has both an intermediate - scale disk ( see section  2 ) and a highly - inclined inner disk ( sections  2 and 5 ) , this is of particular concern . using new , high spatial - resolution spectroscopic data from the osiris instrument on the keck i telescope , in the second part of this paper",
    "we explore the spataila extent and kinematics of this inner disk .",
    "we additionally attempt an independent measurement of the galaxy s black hole mass .",
    "our paper is laid out as follows . in section  [ sec_image ]",
    "we perform a careful structural decomposition of a _ hubble space telescope _",

    "we present our new kinematic data from osiris , and in section  [ sec_mass ] we present a derivation of the black hole mass .",
    "finally , we provide a discussion , including relevance to galaxies other than ngc  1277 , and present our conclusions in section  [ sec_dc ] .    using the planck 2013 results , we assume a spatially flat universe ( i.e.  @xmath42 ) with a cosmological matter fraction @xmath43 and a hubble constant @xmath44 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 ( planck collaboration 2014 ) . correcting the heliocentric radial velocity of 5066@xmath4528 km s@xmath14 ( falco et al",
    ".  1999 ) for ( virgo + great - attractor + shapley ) infall gives a redshift of 4983@xmath4533 km s@xmath14 ( obtained courtesy of ned ) and an ` angular size distance ' of 72.5 mpc when using the above cosmology .",
    "this corresponds to a scale of 352 parsec per arcsecond ( wright 2006 ) .",
    "the ` luminosity distance ' is 75.0 mpc , giving a cosmological redshift corrected distance modulus of 34.38 mag . for reference , this is practically identical to the value of 34.39 mag ( and @xmath46 pc ) used by van den bosch et al .",

    "1277 is located off to the side of those authors primary target galaxy ngc  1275 , located some 4 arcminutes away .",
    "the background sky flux was subtracted to give a count of zero in the galaxy - free corners of the image .",
    "galactic stars and background galaxies in the frame have been masked , and thus avoided in our analysis .",
    "we also paid special attention to the masking of two neighboring galaxies .",
    "the outskirts of ngc  1278  a peculiar elliptical galaxy  appears as faint halo light in the bottom - right corner of figure [ fig : image ] .",
    "the second neighbor is an elliptical galaxy ( indicated with a white arrow in figure [ fig : image ] ) sitting above ngc  1277 at a projected separation of @xmath47 .",
    "these two galaxies have been heavily masked by us , ensuring that no significant light was affecting the outer regions of ngc  1277 .",
    "finally , our masking includes the near side of an obvious dust lane / ring affecting the nuclear region of ngc  1277 .",
    "the final mask is shown in figure [ fig : image ] .",
    "after masking the galaxy image , we performed an isophotal analysis with the _ iraf _ task ellipse ( jedrzejewski 1987 ) , holding the centre fixed and allowing the position angle and ellipticity to vary with radius .",
    "figure  [ fig : isoph ] presents the ellipticity , ` position angle ' and ` fourth harmonic ' ) term . ]",
    "radial profiles along the major - axis , and also along the equivalent - axis , i.e.  the geometric mean of the major ( @xmath48 ) and minor ( @xmath49 ) axis ( @xmath50 ) equivalent to a kind of circularized profile .",
    "the peaks at @xmath51.2 in the ellipticity and fourth harmonic major - axis profiles are an immediately evident feature , indicating the presence of an inner disky component that has largely declined by @xmath52 .",
    "10 - 12@xmath24 along the major - axis , and at 7 - 8@xmath24 along the equivalent - axis , clearly signaling the presence of an intermediate - scale disk .",
    "there are therefore two additional components apparent in ngc  1277 , i.e.  in addition to the main spheroidal structure .",
    "in passing we note that galaxies with intermediate - scale disks , i.e.  galaxies which are intermediate between ` elliptical ' ( e ) and ` lenticular ' ( s0 ) galaxies , are not unusual .",
    "they were first referred to as es galaxies by liller ( 1966 ) and as e / s0 galaxies by strom et al .",
    "( 1977 ; see also strom & strom 1978 and thompson 1976 ) .",
    "they have since been referred to as `` s0-like '' ( michard 1984 ) and `` disk - ellipticals '' ( nieto et al .",
    "1988 ) or `` disky ellipticals '' ( simien & michard 1990 ) . unlike s0 galaxies ,",
    "es galaxies do not have extended disks which dominate the light at large radii .",
    "we fit the major- and equivalent - axis surface brightness profiles with a psf - convolved model , where the radial point spread function ( psf ) has been measured from suitably bright stars in the image and described with a moffat function ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : fit ] we report a slight variation of the frequently used `` root - mean - square deviation '' ( @xmath55 ) when quantifying the global goodness of each fit .",
    "our variation is that we used @xmath56 rather than simply @xmath57 in the denominator due to our successive fitting of models with increased numbers of free parameters @xmath58 .",
    "this does not change the actual fit in any way , and with @xmath59 and @xmath58 ranging from just 3 to 9 , the differences are small .",
    "for example , the fits to the equivalent - axis ( lower panels in figure  [ fig : fit ] ) have `` root - mean - square deviation '' values of 0.0585 , 0.0466 , 0.0273 and 0.0209 .",
    "it should also be kept in mind that both of these measurements reflect the _ global _ goodness of fit , and not the local goodness of fit .",
    "for example , adding a point - source will not have a big impact on the global `` root - mean - square deviation '' even though it may considerably reduce the residuals on a local scale where this component has been added .",
    "we have not used the ( reduced ) chi - squared statistic because this quantity is only useful when one has meaningful measurement errors .",
    "due to dust , psf errors , possible additional components , one may place an inappropriate weight on the data near the centre when using a ( signal - to - noise)-weighted fitting scheme that does not readily account for these biasing factors .",
    "as already noted , ngc  1277 is not a pure elliptical galaxy . indeed , elliptical galaxies with ellipticity greater than 0.5 , i.e.  the old e5 , e6 and e7 elliptical galaxies , were recognized as lenticular disk galaxies many decades ago ( e.g. , liller 1966 and vorontsov - velyaminov & arkhipova s 19621968 `` morphological catalogue of galaxies '' ) .",
    "consequently , a single srsic model ( shown by the left - most panels in figure  [ fig : fit ] ) does not provide an optimal description of ngc  1277 s light profile , and this is evident by the high amplitude of the residual profile .",
    "the addition of an exponential disk component ( second column ) improves the fit , but the residuals are still affected by the previously identified structure peaking at @xmath60 along the major - axis ( and at @xmath61 along the equivalent - axis ) of the ellipticity profile ( figure  [ fig : isoph ] ) . while this is likely to be an inner disk  a feature that is common in galaxies ( e.g.  rest et al .",
    "2001 ; bker et al .  2002 ; balcells et al .  2007 ; seth et al .  2008",
    "; graham et al .  2012 )",
    " when fitting the major - axis light profile , we found that the best description of this component is obtained with a gaussian ring model ( third column ) .",
    "this is perhaps not unexpected given the obvious dust ring ( with a major - axis near 0.7@xmath24 , and a width of @xmath62 ) . ] . adding a central point source , represented by the _",
    "psf and shown in the fourth column of figure  [ fig : fit ] ) , provides a better fit although we note that this is probably not an agn ( fabian et al .",
    "2013 ) . along the major - axis , the gaussian ring model peaks at @xmath63 and has a fwhm width of @xmath64 .",
    "this combination of a point - source and a ring , rather than a single exponential model for an inner disk , is likely due to the ring of dust embedded in the suspected inner disk .",
    "the mask that we used to exclude the dusty region was already at a maximum ; expanding it further resulted in an insufficient amount of image for the task ellipse , and thus it crashed and failed to produce a light - profile when the mask was extended .",
    "along the equivalent - axis , the peak of the dust ring is closer to the center , and the peak of our gaussian ring model when fit to the equivalent - axis light - profile is at @xmath65 ; that is , the gaussian ring has reduced to a normal gaussian , which in this instance has a fwhm equal to @xmath52 ( see the lower right panels of figure  [ fig : fit ] ) .",
    "together , these two components ( a point source plus a psf - convolved , extended gaussian centered at @xmath65 ) combine to approximate the inner disk .",
    "it turns out that this disk is clearly revealed in the kinematic map shown in section  4 , in addition to the ellipticity profile shown in figure  [ fig : isoph ] .",
    "table  1 provides a summary of the best - fitting parameters for each component fit to the galaxy .",
    "again , we did not use a signal - to - noise weighted fitting scheme which would have heightened the sensitivity of the fit to the problematic dusty inner region and amplified any psf mismatch , thereby driving the fit away from the true solution . to mitigate against these concerns ,",
    "an equal weighting was placed on the data shown in figure  [ fig : fit ] , as is commonly done when modelling galaxy surface brightness profiles .    in place of the ring model , we tested the use of an inner exponential component , and alternatively an inner srsic component ( because nearly edge - on disks are better described by a srsic model with index less than 1 , e.g.  pastrav et al .",
    "2013a , b ) , but the solution was unsatisfactory and the data favoured the ring model . integrating the flux of the ring model fit to the equivalent - axis light profile data ( which is simply a gaussian in this instance ) gives an observed apparent magnitude of 16.76 mag ( ab mag , _",
    "f550 m _ ) . accounting for @xmath66 of galactic extinction ( schlafly & finkbeiner 2011 , via the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) )",
    ", gives a corrected apparent magnitude of 16.31 mag ( ab system ) .",
    "we have not attempted any evolutionary nor @xmath67-correction . at a ` luminosity distance ' of 75 mpc , and using @xmath68 ( see section  [ sec_mass ] and martn - navarro et al .",
    "2015a ) , this equates to a stellar mass of 1.67@xmath30 .",
    "given the lack of a significant agn in this galaxy ( fabian et al .",
    "2013 ) , and given that the central point source flux equates to a stellar mass of @xmath69 ( see table  1 ) , the central point source is too large to be a spheroidal star cluster ( e.g.  scott & graham 2013 ) and is therefore most likely part of the inner disk . adding this flux to the ` gaussian ring ' gives a combined mass of 1.8@xmath30 .",
    "this is a massive inner disk ( an order of magnitude greater than the smaller - scale nuclear disks reported in balcells et al .  2007 and scott & graham 2013 ) .",
    "it may therefore be expected to have a large rotation . an interesting , alternative , hypothesis is that this feature may instead be a bar seen close to end - on ( emsellem 2013 ) . if this was the case , then the inclination of the intermediate - scale disk ( within which this bar must reside ) as determined from the geometry of the dust ( presumably now in the bar ) , which is not circular when seen face - on , could be too low . although , one might expect a disk which is closer to edge - on in ngc  1277 to be more apparent at intermediate radii because of the @xmath70 brightening of its surface brightness ( in the absence of dust ) as the apparent axis - ratio @xmath71 goes from 1 to 0 ( e.g. , graham 2001 ) . in the following subsection",
    "we perform a 2d image analysis to better measure the axis - ratio of the intermediate - scale disk and thereby check for a disk more inclined than @xmath1674 degrees .",
    "the total _",
    "f550 m _ galaxy magnitude is @xmath72 .",
    "correcting for galactic dust , this brightens to 13.04 mag , and the ( galactic dust)-corrected bulge magnitude is 13.29 mag ( ab , _",
    "f550 m _ ) .",
    "ngc  1277 has a classical bulge with a srsic index @xmath73 that accounts for 79.4% of the total galaxy light .",
    "the intermediate - scale disk s contribution is 15.2% , while the inner ring / inner disk component makes up @xmath74% .",
    "the percentage by mass is slightly different based on the stellar mass - to - light ratios used for each component ( table  1 ) .         the abstract of van den bosch et al .",
    "( 2012 ) refers to this galaxy as a compact lenticular galaxy with a total stellar mass in excess of @xmath38 .",
    "trujillo et al .  (",
    "2014 ) has similarly identified this galaxy as a likely descendant of the compact massive galaxies seen at @xmath75 , and several other likely descendants were previously identified in dullo & graham ( 2013 ) .",
    "ngc  1277 may indeed have been a compact massive galaxy at @xmath76 which had , or has since acquired , an intermediate - sized stellar disk .",
    "the disk accretion scenario could explain the decreased stellar mass - to - light ratio as one transitions from the spheroid dominated inner region of the galaxy to the disk - dominated region at intermediate radii ( martn - navarro et al .",
    ". one might therefore wonder that if the spheroid in ngc  1277 has not evolved , then perhaps the ( black hole)-to - spheroid mass ratio has also not evolved .",
    "one may of course also wonder if ngc  1277 previously boasted a larger disk , which has since been eroded away in its perseus cluster environment .        the observed mass - scaling between @xmath0 and the many properties of the host galaxy / spheroid ( hutchings et al .  1984 ; dressler 1989 ; yee 1992 ; kormendy & richstone 1995 ; laor 1998 ; magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; etc . , see graham 2015 for a historical review ) is well known to suggest a fundamental connection between massive black holes and their host spheroids .",
    "such observations also provide key input into theoretical investigations trying to determine the details of black hole and galaxy evolution ( e.g. , ciotti & van albada 2001 ; adams et al .  2003 ; heckman et al .",

    "savorgnan et al .  (",
    "2015 ) reveals that the @xmath26 mass ratios range from 0.15% in ( non - dwarf ) early - type galaxies .",
    "this places an important emphasis on any ( black hole)-(host spheroid ) system that appears to not conform with these relations , as the evolution of those systems may need a separate explanation ( ferr - mateu et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "our ao - assisted keck i osiris data suggests the presence of a @xmath77 black hole in ngc  1277 and @xmath78 , where these errors only consider random noise in the kinematic data and do not account for any systematic errors .",
    "this black hole mass may be an upper limit given the negative residual at the centre of figure  [ jamresults ] , however we need to further refine our analysis to better account for the rod - shaped feature seen beyond the black hole s sphere - of - influence ( @xmath79 ) in this @xmath80 residual map .",
    "walsh et al .",
    "( 2015 ) report a black hole mass of @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( in agreement with the optimal solution in emsellem 2013 ) . from figure  2 in walsh",
    "et al . , one can see that if @xmath83 then one would have @xmath84 , and at @xmath78 one has @xmath85 .",
    "that is , the degeneracy between the black hole mass and the stellar mass - to - light ratio can _ partly _ explain some of the differences between us and walsh et al .",
    "( 2015 ) . of course",
    "other differences exist , such as our problematic jam modeling of the inner @xmath86 ( radius ) containing the edge - on disk versus their schwarschild modeling of just the inner @xmath87 ( radius ) . coupled with the host spheroid mass , these two black hole masses ( i.e.  ours , and that from emsellem et al .  2012 and walsh et al .",
    "2015 ) give a ( black hole)-to-(host spheroid ) mass ratio of 0.45 and 1.8 percent .",
    "we therefore conclude that ngc  1277 does not host an over - massive black hole .",
    "this downward revision of this ratio for ngc  1277 may not bode well for recent papers claiming ngc  1277 as a potential prototype in support of the direct collapse of massive black holes ( e.g.  bonoli et al .",

    "ngc  4342 is another lenticular galaxy without a partially - depleted core and with an allegedly over - massive black hole ( cretton & van den bosch 1999 )  weighing in at nearly 7 per cent of the bulge mass ( bogdn et al .",

    "<S> the identification of galaxies with ` overly massive ' black holes requires a black hole mass ( @xmath0 ) _ and _ a host spheroid mass ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> here we provide our measurements for ngc  1277 . </S>",
    "<S> our structural decomposition reveals that ngc  1277 is dominated by a ` classical ' spheroid with a srsic index @xmath2 , a half - light radius @xmath3 kpc , and a stellar mass of @xmath4 ( using @xmath5 , martn - navarro et  al . ) . </S>",
    "<S> this mass is an order of magnitude greater than originally reported . </S>",
    "<S> using the latest @xmath6@xmath7 , @xmath6@xmath8 , and @xmath6@xmath9 relations , the expected black hole mass is respectively ( @xmath10 , ( @xmath11 , and ( @xmath12 ( using @xmath13 km s@xmath14 ) for which the ` sphere - of - influence ' is @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> our new kinematical maps obtained from laser guide star assisted , adaptive optics on the keck i telescope dramatically reaffirm the presence of the inner , nearly edge - on , disk seen in this galaxy s image . </S>",
    "<S> we also report that this produces a large velocity shear ( @xmath16400  km  s@xmath14 ) across the inner @xmath17 ( 70  parsec ) plus elevated values of @xmath18 across the inner @xmath19 region of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> our new multi - gaussian expansion ( mge ) models and jeans anisotropic mge ( jam ) analysis struggled to match this component . </S>",
    "<S> our optimal black hole mass , albeit a probable upper limit because of the disk , is @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is an order of magnitude smaller than originally reported and 4 times smaller than recently reported . </S>",
    "<S> it gives an @xmath22 ratio of 0.45% in agreement with the median ( @xmath230.5% ) and range ( 0.15.0% ) observed in non - dwarf , early - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this result highlights the need for caution with inner disks . </S>"
