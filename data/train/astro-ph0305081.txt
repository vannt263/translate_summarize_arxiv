    "in fact , electron heating and acceleration are signatures of magnetic reconnection . in the magnetotail",
    ", bursts of energetic electrons have been attributed to reconnection @xcite and there have been recent direct measurements of electron acceleration during magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "production of runaway electrons during sawtooth instabilities and disruptions is associated with magnetic reconnection in tokamaks @xcite . in solar flares ,",
    "x - ray observations indicate that a large fraction of the total energy is released in accelerated electrons @xcite .",
    "the observed synchroton radiation in extragalatic jets is thought to be generated by reacceleration or in - situ acceleration of electrons due to magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that the detection of hard x - ray and @xmath4-ray from agn is due to the presence of electrons accelerated by magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "electron dynamics in the reconnection region have been studied using analytical arguments @xcite , test particle theory @xcite , self - consistent fluid simulations @xcite , and kinetic simulations @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study the electron dynamics near the reconnection region with self - consistent kinetic simulations of high and low @xmath0 plasmas .",
    "the plasma @xmath0 is varied from very large ( @xmath1 ) to small ( @xmath5 ) values and systems are simulated with an ion / electron mass ratio up to the physical value ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we consider two - dimensional reconnection in harris current sheet configurations @xcite , triggered by an initial perturbation @xcite .",
    "we introduce a guide field to reduce the plasma @xmath0 and eliminate the null field region at the current sheet . to perform kinetic simulations ,",
    "we use celeste3d @xcite , an implicit particle - in - cell ( pic ) code , which models both kinetic ions and electrons while allowing simulations with higher mass ratios .",
    "we show that both the plasma @xmath0 and the mass ratio strongly affect the electron dynamics . in low-@xmath0 plasmas ,",
    "the electron meandering orbits present in high @xmath0 plasmas disappear .",
    "we focus on the out - of - plane electron velocity , which remains localized in the high-@xmath0 case , and which is sizable also far from the reconnection region in low @xmath0 plasmas @xcite .",
    "a strong influence of the mass ratio on the out - of - plane velocity is shown by the simulations and the relevant scaling law is deduced .",
    "we show that the heating process is non - isotropic in presence of a guide field ; in particular , the particles are preferably heated in the out - of - plane direction . this anisotropy contributes to the break - up of the frozen - in condition for electrons and allows reconnection to happen .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the physical system and the simulations .",
    "section iii presents the results of the simulations , focusing on the typical trajectory of the electrons that pass through the reconnection region and the evolution of the electron fluid velocity and temperature during reconnection .",

    "the temperature ratio is @xmath12 , the current sheet thickness is @xmath13 , the background density is @xmath14 , and the ion drift velocity in the @xmath15 direction is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the alfvn velocity , and @xmath18 . the ion inertial length , @xmath19 , is defined using the density @xmath20 .",
    "we apply periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath21 direction and perfect conductors in the @xmath22 direction .",
    "the standard gem challenge parameters model reconnection in high @xmath0 plasmas .",
    "to model low @xmath0 plasmas , it is possible to consider either a entirely different equilibrium @xcite , or one may introduce a guide field in the standard harris sheet equilibrium .",
    "herein , we follow the second approach and we introduce a guide field @xmath23 , with a spatially constant value at @xmath24 . the simulations are performed with different mass ratios , ranging from @xmath25 ( standard gem mass ratio ) to the physical mass ratio for hydrogen , @xmath6 .",
    "following _ birn et al . _",
    "@xcite , the harris equilibrium is modified by introducing an initial flux perturbation in the form @xmath26 with @xmath27 , which puts the system in the non - linear regime from the beginning of the simulation .    the simulations shown in the present paper are performed using the implicit pic code celeste3d , which solves the full set of maxwell - vlasov equations using the implicit moment method @xcite .",
    "the implicit method allows more rapid simulations on ion length and time scales than are allowed with explicit methods , yet retains the kinetic effects of both electrons and ions .",
    "in particular , the explicit time step and grid spacing limits are replaced in implicit simulations by an accuracy condition , @xmath28 , whose principal effect is to determine how well energy is conserved . in the simulations shown below , we typically choose @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "previous work on magnetic reconnection performed by celeste3d have proved that results from our implicit code match well the results of explicit codes @xcite .",
    "implicit simulations allow one to model physical mass ratios , with which it is possible to distinguish scaling laws associated with different break - up mechanisms @xcite .",
    "celeste3d has also been employed in a comprehensive study of the physics of fast magnetic reconnection , in plasmas characterized by different @xmath0 values @xcite .",
    "we have performed a set of simulations , using different mass ratios ( @xmath32 ) and introducing different guide fields : @xmath33 , with @xmath34 at the center of the current sheet ; @xmath35 , with @xmath36 ; and @xmath37 , with @xmath38 .",
    "we note that a guide field changes drastically the magnetic configuration of the system as the x point is no longer a null - point , as it is in the @xmath33 case .",
    "the dynamics of magnetic reconnection in plasmas with different values of @xmath0 have been pointed out and summarized in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the reconnected flux , @xmath39 , defined as the flux difference between the x and the o points for all the simulations considered @xcite .",
    "even though an initial perturbation is applied , reconnection proceeds slowly during an initial transient phase ( which lasts approximatively until @xmath40 ) , when the system adjust to the initial perturbation .",
    "subsequently , reconnection develops rapidly until the saturation level is reached .",
    "both the reconnection rate and the saturation level decrease when the guide field is increased .",
    "all the simulations show a similar evolution .",
    "the mechanism which breaks the electron frozen - in condition is provided by the off - diagonal terms of the electron pressure tensor for all the guide fields considered @xcite .",
    "the reconnection rate is enhanced by the whistler dynamics in high @xmath0 plasmas , and by the kinetic alfvn waves dynamics in low @xmath0 plasmas @xcite , provided that @xmath41 . when @xmath42 , fast reconnection is not possible @xcite .",
    "theoretical results and kinetic simulations @xcite show that with @xmath33 , electrons flow towards the x point along the @xmath22 direction , where they are demagnetized in a region corresponding to the meandering length , @xmath43 .",
    "there they are accelerated by the reconnection electric field , @xmath44 , in the @xmath15 direction .",
    "the electrons are then diverted by the @xmath45 field , gaining an outflow velocity in the @xmath21 direction , and becoming remagnetized at the meandering length , @xmath46 .",
    "the meandering lengths are defined as @xcite    @xmath47 ^{1/4},d_{ze}=\\left [ \\frac{m_e t_e}{e^2 ( \\partial b_x/ \\partial z ) ^2 } \\right ] ^{1/4 } \\label{medis}\\ ] ]    while the maximum inflow and outflow velocities scale as @xcite    @xmath48 ^{1/4},v_{ze}=\\left [ \\frac{e^2 e^4_y}{4 m_e t_e ( \\partial b_x/ \\partial z ) ^2 } \\right ] ^{1/4 } \\label{vel}\\ ] ]    in the reconnection region , the electrons are unmagnetized and follow complex meandering orbits , which result in a non - gyrotropic electron distribution function and in off - diagonal terms of the electron pressure @xcite .",
    "when a guide field is introduced , the meandering orbits disappear .",
    "analytical estimates of the guide field at which this happens are given by @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the diagonal components of the electron pressure tensor are unequal , which contributes to the presence of off - diagonal pressure terms @xcite .",
    "these terms still constitute the break - up mechanism of the frozen - in condition @xcite . in the reconnection region ,",
    "the electrons flow across the field line in the @xmath7 plane , while performing a larmor motion around the out - of - plane magnetic field .",
    "far from the reconnection region , the guide field causes additional components of the @xmath49 force , which modify the ion and electron motion and cause asymmetric plasma flow .",
    "below , we describe in detail the typical trajectory of an electron passing through the reconnection region in high and low @xmath0 plasmas .",
    "then , we focus on the electron fluid velocity , in particular on the out - of - plane velocity .",
    "finally , we consider the electron distribution functions to evaluate the electron temperature .",
    "figure 2 shows a typical trajectory of an electron passing through the reconnection region in the case @xmath33 , and fig .",
    "3 shows the history of its velocity and kinetic energy .    in fig .",
    "2 , the initial position of the particle is denoted by a plus sign , and its position at selected time steps by circles .",
    "x marks the position of the x point .",
    "note that periodic boundary conditions are applied in the @xmath21 direction , as the behavior of the trajectory shows ( the particle exits from the left and re - enters from the right ) . at the beginning",
    ", the electron is tied to a magnetic field line ( magnetic field lines run mainly along the @xmath21 direction ) . near the reconnection point , the electron decouples from the magnetic field and moves along the @xmath22 direction , reaching the x point at @xmath50 .",
    "the particle trajectory is meandering in the unmagnetized region .",
    "the outflow from the reconnection region takes place as soon as the electron reaches a region with stronger magnetic field .",
    "then , the electron couples again to a magnetic line surrounding the o point , and starts again its gyration orbit around it .    in fig .",
    "3 , all components of the particle velocity and the kinetic energy are plotted as a function of time .",
    "initially , the electron is flowing along the @xmath21 direction , with a larmor motion mostly in the @xmath51 plane , which is responsible for the high frequency oscillations of the velocity ( the magnetic field line is mostly directed along @xmath21 ) . during this phase",
    ", the electron kinetic energy is almost conserved .",
    "when the electron decouples from the magnetic field line as it crosses the reconnection region , it is accelerated by the reconnection electric field in the @xmath15 direction .",
    "this acceleration transfers magnetic field energy to electrons during magnetic reconnection . as fig",
    ". 3 shows , while the electron is unmagnetized , the kinetic energy of the electron increases remarkably , showing high frequency oscillations due to the acceleration and de - acceleration by the electric field .",
    "when the electron leaves the reconnection region and again couples to the magnetic field , motion in @xmath15 becomes larmor motion with a bigger radius , and the velocity directed along @xmath15 gained in the reconnection region is lost .",
    "the particle couples to a magnetic field line that surrounds the o point and starts to flow along it .    in fig .",
    "4 the electron trajectory is traced for a low @xmath0 plasma , with a strong guide field , @xmath52 .",
    "initially , the particle flows along the magnetic line , which is mainly directed along the @xmath15 direction , and executes a larmor motion mostly in the @xmath7 plane .",
    "the particle then accelerates towards the x point , crosses magnetic lines in the @xmath7 plane , and gains an out - of - plane velocity which increases its kinetic energy ( see fig .",
    "the particle still couples to the magnetic field and executes a larmor orbit around the guide field .",
    "meandering orbits are not present .",
    "in contrast to the case with @xmath33 , the electron maintains its @xmath15 velocity even when far from the reconnection region because now the gyration is in the @xmath7 plane around the @xmath15-directed guide field .",
    "finally , the electron drifts along a magnetic field line around the o point maintaining a still significant @xmath15 velocity which decreases slowly because of the interactions of the electron with the non - drifting plasma background .",
    "the presence of the guide field changes the nature of electron acceleration : without guide field , the @xmath15 velocity is lost while in presence of guide field is retained even far from the reconnection region @xcite .      when @xmath33 , both kinetic simulations and theoretical results @xcite show that the electrons are demagnetized at the electron meandering distance [ see eqs .",

    "new components of the @xmath49 field arise , and the electron in - plane motion has been described in refs .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    ", we focus on the electron out - of - plane velocity . in fig .",
    "6 , the velocity along the axis @xmath53 is depicted with @xmath33 for three different mass ratios , @xmath32 .",
    "the maximum out - of - plane velocity increases with the mass ratio .",
    "we note that the out - of - plane velocity is sizeable only in the reconnection region .",
    "the out - of - plane velocity can be estimated for @xmath33 .",
    "the electron lifetime in the reconnection region , @xmath54 , from eqs .",
    "( [ medis]-[vel ] ) is approximately    @xmath55    as the magnetic field is negligible in the reconnection region , the electrons are freely accelerated and the out - of - plane velocity can be estimated as @xmath56 and , using eq .",
    "( [ tauu ] ) , it follows that @xmath57    since the temperature of the electrons is the same for all mass ratios , it follows that the electron out - of - plane velocity scales with @xmath58 .",
    "the results presented in fig . 6 fit well this scaling law , as is shown in table i.    figures 7 and 8 consider the effect of the guide field on the out - of - plane electron velocity . as",
    "the guide field allows the particles to flow more easily in the out - of - plane direction , the peak velocity increases remarkably when the guide field becomes stronger , fig .",
    "7 . moreover , the presence of the guide field changes the general pattern of the out - of - plane velocity , as shown in fig .",
    "when @xmath33 , the out - of - plane velocity is sizeable only near the reconnection region , where the electrons are accelerated by the electric field .",
    "the out - of - plane velocity is lost when the electrons become again magnetized and are diverted by the @xmath45 field . in presence of the guide field ,",
    "the electrons maintain their @xmath15 velocity when they leave the reconnection region and orbit around the o point .",
    "note that this conclusion is further supported by the analysis of particle orbits performed in the subsection above ( iii.b ) .    as a final remark",
    ", we note that the out - of - plane velocity evolves during magnetic reconnection , as is shown in fig .",
    "for all the guide fields considered , the electron velocity increases while reconnection proceeds ( the evolution of the reconnected flux in these simulations is presented in fig .",
    "1 ) . after reconnection saturates , the reconnection electric field vanishes and",
    "the electrons are no longer accelerated .",
    "the out - of - plane velocity in the former reconnection region decreases abruptly .",
    "the evolution of the electron temperatures in the reconnection region , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , are plotted in fig .",
    "10 for the three different guide field strengths .",
    "we note that @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are defined as the second moment of the distribution functions of the @xmath21 , @xmath15 , and @xmath22 velocity @xcite .    in the zero guide field case ,",
    "the @xmath59 and @xmath60 evolution is similar ( see fig .",
    "@xmath59 increases because the positive and negative outflow velocity causes an increases spread in the @xmath21 velocity .",
    "the heating in the @xmath15 direction is due to the electric field which , besides accelerating the electrons , spreads out their velocity , reflecting the variation in electron residence time in the reconnection region , which depends on their in - plane inflow and outflow velocity , and thus are accelerated by different amounts .",
    "after reconnection saturates , the heating process stops and electrons tend to thermalize , causing an increase in @xmath61 .",
    "we note that the total energy of the system is conserved during the simulation within an error of the order of 4% @xcite .",
    "when the guide field is introduced , both @xmath59 and @xmath61 remain almost constant at the initial level during the reconnection process , while @xmath60 increases remarkably .",
    "the guide field introduces an higher electron mobility in the @xmath15 direction .",
    "thus , the electron can be accelerated by the electric field more than in the @xmath33 case along the @xmath15 direction , and the @xmath15 velocities spread out more , while @xmath60 increases .",
    "the anisotropy in the electron temperature contributes to the break - up of the frozen - in condition .",
    "in fact , in the presence of a guide field , the difference between the diagonal terms of the electron pressure tensor contributes to the off - diagonal terms , which are responsible for the break - up of the frozen - in condition @xcite , as it is @xcite @xmath62 @xmath63    since @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the importance of the anisotropy in the electron temperature is evident .",
    "in the present paper , the electron dynamics during magnetic reconnection has been studied by showing and discussing results of kinetic simulations of harris current sheets .",
    "simulations with different plasma @xmath0 and different mass ratio have been considered .    by varying the guide field ,",
    "we have been able to model reconnection in systems such as the magnetotail ( @xmath33 ) , the magnetopause ( @xmath66 ) , laboratory and astrophysical plasmas ( @xmath67 ) .    by studying the typical electron trajectories , we have shown that ,",
    "when the plasma @xmath0 is decreased , the electrons mainly perform larmor motion around the guide field even in the reconnection region , and that meandering orbits disappear . in all the cases ,",
    "electrons are accelerated by the reconnection electric field along the @xmath15 direction and their velocity increases with the guide field .",
    "moreover , the out - of - plane velocity increases during reconnection . in high @xmath0 plasmas ,",
    "the out - of - plane velocity is sizable only in the electron reconnection region . with a guide field , the out - of - plane velocity is globally relevant .",
    "the mass ratio has a strong influence on the out - of - plane velocity and the scaling law of interest is derived .",
    "the study of the electron temperature in the reconnection region has shown a strong heating anisotropy in presence of a guide field , which contributes to the break - up of the electron frozen - in condition .    in closing",
    ", we note that we plan to develop the present work in two directions .",
    "first , we plan to introduce the relativistic equations of motion in celeste3d , in order to represent better the electron physics when relativistic effects become important .",
