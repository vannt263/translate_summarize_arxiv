    "the antarctic plateau has great potential for astronomical observations as it is extremely cold and dry and has a calm and tenuous atmosphere  attributes that are particularly favourable for optical , infrared and * submillimeter * observations . for photometry",
    ", there is the advantage of reduced scintillation as a result of the decreased high - altitude turbulence above the antarctica plateau .",
    "@xcite . in addition",
    ", there is the * possibility * of long , continuous observations uninterrupted by the usual diurnal cycle , giving access to a time - series regime otherwise only available from space @xcite .",
    "astronomers have been interested in the antarctic plateau for over thirty years ( see @xcite for a historical account ) .",
    "the first stellar photometry from antarctica was conducted at the south pole by @xcite in the late 1980s .",
    "more recently , strassmeier and colleagues @xcite have conducted continuous time - series observations from  with sirait , a small f/12 optical telescope .",
    "the astep south project has reported 1592 hours of observations of the south celestial pole from  during 2008 using a 10 cm refractor and @xmath5 pixel ccd camera @xcite .    at optical wavelengths",
    "most of the attention is now focussed on the concordia station at dome c , where excellent cloud - cover statistics , low free - atmosphere seeing and a relatively thin turbulent boundary layer have been measured , as summarised in e.g. , @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite investigated the seeing at  and reported that the median seeing above the boundary layer is @xmath6 , and for 25% of the time is as low to 0.15@xmath7 .",
    "thus , for some observations even a small telescope at  can be as effective as a much larger one at the best temperate observatories .",
    "is located at longitude @xmath8e , latitude @xmath9s , and is 1271 km directly inland from the chinese zhongshan station .",
    "the elevation of  is 4093 meters above sea level , the temperature is quite low ( sometimes below @xmath10c ) , the surface wind speeds are even lower than those at , and the precipitable water vapor is extraordinarily low @xcite .",
    "the seeing at  from above the boundary layer may be better than that at , and the boundary layer itself should be thinner  perhaps as low as 15 meters for much of the time .",
    "recently , @xcite compared domes a , b , c and f , and ridges a and b from the point of view of cloud cover , boundary layer thickness , auroral emission , free - atmosphere seeing , precipitable water vapor and surface temperature  and concluded that  is possibly the best site on earth currently being used for astronomical observations .",
    "because of the potential opportunities offered by  for astronomy and other scientific studies , an permanent station , _ kunlun station",
    "_ , was established at  by the 25@xmath0 chinese expedition team in 2009 january .    in early 2007 ,",
    "chinese astronomers began the development of cstar , with an extensive testing program ( zhou et al .",
    "2009 ) . in november of that year ,",
    "the cstar system was shipped to antarctica as part of the plateau observatory ( plato ) @xcite , and commissioned at  in 2008 january .",
    "cstar began observations from  in 2008 march , as soon as the sky became sufficiently dark . during the year",
    ", we were typically able to return one image per day and roughly one third of the photometric catalog ( less than 3000 bright stars ) via iridium satellite .",
    "cstar worked well until early august , when the plato power system shut down .",
    "the 25@xmath0 chinese expedition team returned to  in 2009 january , retrieving all the data including images and catalogs that were stored on a large hard disk .",
    "the  data are valuable as they have many potential uses , from site characterisation to the study of astronomical sources such as variable stars , supernovae , gamma - ray bursts and extra - solar planets .",
    "a separate paper analysing the weather statistics of the  site from cstar data is in preparation @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "a description of cstar and the data reduction method are presented in  2 .",
    "the observations from  are described in  3 . in  4 , we describe the data processing of these observations to produce the catalog . in  5 , we discuss the photometric accuracy of the catalog .",
    "a final summary is presented in  6 .",
    "the cstar program is conducted under the auspices of the chinese center for antarctic astronomy .",
    "the telescopes were built by the nanjing institute of astronomical optics & technology ( niaot ) @xcite , while the hardware and software of the data acquisition system were developed by the national astronomical observatories , chinese academy of sciences ( naoc ) @xcite .",
    "cstar consists of four 14.5 cm schmidt telescopes , each with a different filter : g , r , i and open .",
    "the fov is @xmath1120 deg@xmath12 ) .",
    "each telescope is equipped with an andor dv435 1k@xmath131k ccd , giving a pixel size of about 15@xmath7 in the sky .",
    "a 750 gb hard disk is used as the main storage , with all the software including the windows xp operating system installed in a 4 gb compact flash memory .",
    "an 8 gb solid state disk is used in each computer to back up the most important data .",
    "the computer system can work at temperatures down to @xmath14c , and is installed inside the plato instrument module where it is kept well above this temperature by the plato thermal management system @xcite .",
    "the ccd cameras and electronics are installed outside on the cstar telescopes , where the ambient temperature can be lower than @xmath15c .    before its deployment to",
    ", the cstar data acquisition system was tested at kalasu on the high plateau of pamir in china , close to tajikistan . at an elevation of 4450 meters and with temperatures that plunged to @xmath16c during the tests",
    ", kalasu provides an excellent environment for pre - deployment testing of astronomical instruments for .",
    "the complete cstar system was also tested at the naoc s xinglong observatory at the beginning of september of 2007 .",
    "details of these tests are presented in @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "we also describe the data acquisition procedure and automatic photometric pipeline used to perform aperture photometry on all the point sources in our images .",
    "the apertures for the photometry are 3 , 4 and 5 pixels in radius and the inner and outer radius of the sky annulus is 10 and 20 pixels , respectively .",
    "the typical fwhm of the point spread function ( psf ) of a stellar image taken by cstar#1 is between 1.5 and 2.5 pixels . *",
    "the spot diagram under laboratory conditions , that is @xmath17c and 1 atm pressure , is shown in @xcite .",
    "the optical system may have suffered some misalignment from vibration during the almost 1300 km sled traverse from zhongshan station to dome a. it is also possible that there were some optical alignment changes due to the low ambient temperature at dome a , although this was allowed for in the design .",
    "an image from cstar#1 , a5ch5029.fit , is shown in figure  [ fig:9 ] to illustrate the realized optical quality at dome a , where @xmath18 of the light energy is encircled in 2 pixels .",
    "cstar observed robotically at  from 2008 march 4 until 2008 august 8 ( see figure [ fig:10 ] ) , taking an image with each telescope whenever it was dark enough to do so .",
    "the exposure time was changed from 20 sec to 30 sec on april 4 .",
    "the ccd is a frame transfer ccd , which allows us to operate without a mechanical shutter .",
    "we readout the image after each exposure and perform a real - time data reduction for producing an initial catalog .",
    "a deadtime of @xmath22.61 sec results in times between exposures of 22.61 sec , or 32.61 sec after april 4 .",
    "images were not taken if the sky was too bright . for a variety of technical reasons only cstar#1 produced images of good optical quality during 2008 .",
    "there are 16918 , 50575 , 68157 , 110357 , 58711 and 5749 of these images from march , april , may , june , july and august , respectively .",
    "the total exposure times were 67.4 , 311.4 , 378.7 , 613.1 , 326.2 and 31.9 hours , respectively , in these months , giving a total exposure time of 1728 hours .",
    "we plot the distribution of integrated exposure time for each month in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the integrated exposure time in june is the longest and is over one third of the total exposure time , while the exposure time in august is the shortest due to the shutdown of the plato power system .",
    "we have developed a pipeline for image processing and photometry that includes bias and flat - field correction , and then performs aperture photometry @xcite .",
    "this work was undertaken during testing cstar at naoc s xinglong station .",
    "the quality of the images taken at  was significantly better than obtained at xinglong due to the lower ccd temperature and improved sky conditions .",
    "* we constructed a flat - field image , shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] , from a median of images taken with a high sky background , after removal of stars using sigma - clipping . to correct for variations in the flat - field over large spatial scales , we selected more than 50,000 images taken under conditions of good transparency and looked for systematic changes in the brightnesses of stars during their daily circular motion around the south pole .",
    "this allowed us to create an additional `` residual flat - field '' correction that improved our photometric accuracy . *        * for this first release of the catalog we have not checked the variation of the flat - field during the year , nor with ccd temperature .",
    "the next release will include improved flat - fielding using images taken under photometric conditions with high sky background ( i.e. , during twilight or bright moon ) .",
    "*      * an image , a5ch5029 , was taken under relatively good photometric conditions ( 17:50:29 ut , 2008 may 5 ) and was used as a standard image for calibrating magnitude offsets .",
    "for each other image , we derived a single magnitude offset , to be applied to all the stars on the image , from the mean of the magnitude offsets of a selection of bright stars . *",
    "the usno - b catalog @xcite contains stellar magnitudes in the optical passbands b1 , b2 , r1 , r2 and i2 for over one billion objects over the whole sky .",
    "the catalog is complete down to @xmath19  mag , with a positional accuracy of @xmath20 at j2000 and a photometric accuracy of better than 0.3 magnitudes in the five colors .",
    "since the usno - b catalog contains such well calibrated magnitudes of the point sources in our observed field , we elected to use these objects for our flux calibration .",
    "fortunately , @xcite have derived a formula for transforming the usno - b1.0 magnitudes to those appropriate to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) filters , based on @xmath21 deg@xmath12 of sdss early data release . since",
    "the cstar filters were chosen to be very similar to the sdss filters , we can use this formula directly .",
    "we determine @xmath22 with 48 field stars .",
    "the differences between cstar instrumental magnitude and sdss magnitudes of these stars are shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the offset was used to transform the cstar instrumental magnitudes to sdss i - band magnitudes . * to reduce statistical measurement errors , we only selected the brightest stars for the offset calibration .",
    "we plan to do further work on choosing well - calibrated standard stars for our next run of the data reduction pipeline .",
    "*          the cstar#3 computer included a gps receiver to maintain time synchronisation and this time was intended to be distributed to the other cstar computers . however , there was a communication problem between cstar#3 and the other computers throughout the year . as a result ,",
    "the timing of cstar#1 ran independently and at its own rate for the entire observation period . while this would normally create an intractable data reduction problem",
    " particularly when determining the epochs of transient events and eclipses  in this case it is easily corrected .",
    "cstar is fixed in position and points at the south celestial pole .",
    "every star traces out a circle on the ccd , and the position of each star can be used as a clock . to identify the stars ,",
    "we calculate the rotation and shift of every image relative to a standard image using the positions of all the bright stars .",
    "the mean rotation angle relative to the standard image is then used to derive the rate of drift of computer time . in this way , precise timing can be determined .",
    "we find that the computer clock typically runs 1.3885714 seconds / day slower than the real local time .",
    "figure  [ fig:6 ] shows the time difference between the computer time and the real time obtained from the star positions during a period of 140 days of observation .",
    "the computer time on 2008 january 25 should be correct , because the computer time was manually set to gps time ( ut ) on that date .",
    "in the catalog we present the corrected julian time at the mid - exposure point of every image .",
    "this time should be accurate to * a few seconds*.          besides the statistical errors in the star and background brightness measurements , there are several systematic errors that may affect the derived stellar fluxes .",
    "the main systematic errors are :    \\1 ) residual flat - field and bias correction errors .",
    "* light curves of all of the stars that had no significant variation were used to improve the flat - field correction map . however , a single flat - field and bias image were used for all observations , with no attempt to allow for temperature variations or instrumental drifts .",
    "this may have introduced systematic errors with each star tracing out a circle on the ccd .",
    "*    \\2 ) point spread function ( psf ) variation .",
    "the cstar telescopes have a large field - of - view , @xmath23 square degrees , making it impossible for the optical design to keep the psf uniform over all parts of the image .",
    "since we used a fixed aperture to measure the magnitudes of the stars , there will be some measurement error from the psf variation depending on the star location within the image .",
    "\\3 ) under - sampling .",
    "each pixel of the cstar ccd is 15@xmath7 , so the light from a star might fall on only one or two pixels , with resultant problems from intra - pixel sensitivity variations .",
    "\\4 ) aurorae and thin cirrus clouds .",
    "these introduce an inhomogeneity in the sky background , especially during full moon . in the case of cirrus , there will be a resultant variable extinction across the field - of - view . the photometric calibration can therefore differ from one star to another .",
    "the sky background for each star is also difficult to estimate in the presence of cirrus .",
    "the systematic photometric error exceeds other sources of error when observing bright stars . as an example",
    ", we plot the light curve of a bright star ( hip 48752 = gsc 9518:379 ) of i@xmath248.2  mag at ( @xmath25 ) in figure  [ fig:5 ] . in the figure ,",
    "the light curves for every 10 days , with an arbitrary magnitude offset , are shown . from examining the best quality images , the rms of the light curve variation",
    "is about 0.003 mag .",
    "we expect that the systematic error should be smaller than 0.003 mag .    to estimate the overall real measurement error for each field star in the image , we compared every image to a standard image .",
    "the standard image , a5ch5029 , was taken under relatively good photometric conditions ( 17:50:29 ut , 2008 may 5 ) . by comparison of the calibrated magnitudes of all the stars in the two images",
    ", we can plot the rms error as a function of the magnitude of the stars .    as an example we show in figure  [ fig:7 ] the distribution of the measurement difference in magnitude for every star obtained from image a62m5104 and the standard image a5ch5029 .",
    "we divided the magnitude range into small bins of 0.2 mag , then calculated the @xmath26 dispersion of the magnitude as the `` real measurement error '' in each magnitude interval .",
    "the error bars as a function of magnitude as shown in figure  [ fig:7 ] were then applied to all the measurements in the catalog for that image .",
    "we defined the magnitude limit of our images as the magnitude which has a @xmath26 rms error of 0.1 mag , which corresponds to a s / n=10 .        as a byproduct of estimating the measurement error , the magnitude limit is also obtained for each image . in figure  [ fig:8 ]",
    "we plot the limiting magnitude distribution for all of the images taken over the 24 hours during 2008 may 12 . the limiting magnitude changes with time because of variations in atmospheric extinction and sky brightness .",
    "the final output from our data reduction is a catalog of star magnitudes for each image .",
    "the contents of the catalog are arranged as follow : the first two columns are ra and dec , respectively ; the following columns are the magnitudes and errors in aperture photometry obtained with radii of 3 , 4 , and 5 pixels respectively . in the header of the catalog",
    "some additional information is provided : the ccd temperature , the date and corrected time ( ut ) at the exposure midpoint , exposure time ( seconds ) , sky brightness ( adu ) , filter number and number of sources found in the image .",
