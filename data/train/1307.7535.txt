    "measurement of a current is one of the most standard techniques to obtain the intrinsic information about the target system in the condensed matter physics .",
    "theoretically , the probability distribution of transferred charge obtained in a current measurement is described by the full counting statistics , that was first proposed by levitov and lesovik  @xcite and then has been established in the last two decades .",
    "most of theoretical studies , however , focus on the ideal measurement ( see refs   and references therein ) and only a few of studies deal with the influence of the device limitations  @xcite .",
    "when ideal current measurements are conducted , the universal relation is satisfied between the linear conductance and current noise , i.e. the johnson - nyquist ( j - n ) relation  @xcite .",
    "the j - n relation is an early significant example of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite , and provides a proportional relation between the variance of a fluctuating current through a conductor , i.e. current noise , and the conductance as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the temperature of the conducting electrons , @xmath10 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath11 represents the equilibrium noise , and @xmath12 reads the linear response of the averaged current @xmath13 to applied bias voltage @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "in addition to its importance in fundamental physics , the j - n relation also has a practical significance in thermometry  @xcite .",
    "since the temperature can be determined by measuring only @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the johnson noise thermometry has been exploited in rapidly developing noise measurements of nanosystems from which we obtain the useful information about the low - energy excitations in the quantum systems  @xcite and confirm the steady state fluctuation theorem  @xcite .    when a sample is placed in a dilute refrigerator ,",
    "however , the noise temperature determined from the j - n relation , @xmath17 , is sometimes higher than the temperature of the refrigerator independently measured with a resistance thermometer , @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy has been recognized since early 1970s  @xcite , and attributed to a heat leak to the sample in the refrigerator  @xcite . since",
    "an increasing discrepancy is observed only at very low temperatures above which @xmath19 is satisfied , it is generally agreed that the measured noise is properly calibrated and @xmath17 represents the actual electron temperature  @xcite .",
    "the seemingly correct interpretation , however , does not include consideration of the possibility of an extrinsic noise enhancing only at such very low temperatures .    in this paper",
    ", we theoretically investigate the influence of resolution , ( in other words the smallest detectable change in measurement ) , on the current measurement , which at least qualitatively accounts for the discrepancy .",
    "the resolution fundamentally limits the available information in the measurement process , which must affect the observed fluctuation and noise .",
    "in fact , the limited resolution gives rise to an enhancement of the extrinsic noise only at very low temperatures as discussed in the sec .",
    "v.    before going into the detail , we briefly explain our formalism and main results . to understand the resolution effects on the current measurement",

    "levitov and lesovik introduced a precessing 1/2 spin , which measures a current indirectly via the induced magnetic field  @xcite : the precession angle is proportional to the net charge transferred near by the spin for a measurement time , @xmath29 .",

    "hence , the j - n relation can be violated between the measured noise @xmath56 and measured conductance @xmath61 in the practical cases , which causes a discrepancy between @xmath62 and @xmath63 at low temperatures .",
    "the deviation from the j - n relation between @xmath56 and @xmath64 caused by the limited resolution is represented by , @xmath65 it is remarkable that the ratio of noises obeys a scaling law with the scaling variable @xmath45 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where @xmath47 is the characteristic noise determined solely from the measurement scheme .",
    "the scaling function exhibits the universal exponential dependence for @xmath3 having the essential singularity at @xmath5 with increasing from zero to unity , and shows a crossover to an algebraic increase or a constant at @xmath66 . from the scaling law , we find that @xmath1 is not detectable in noise experiments when @xmath1 is much smaller than @xmath67 , @xmath7 .",
    "since @xmath68 is the standard deviation of the transferred particle number counted with the ideal resolution , it means the average number of particle involved in the measurement for @xmath44 .",
    "the enhanced deviation for large @xmath69 is , therefore , consistent with our intuition that the resolution error of noise should be more profound in the case that only a few particles are involved .",
    "although the above discussion of scaling is based on the specific model , essentially the same scaling relation is expected be satisfied for an arbitrary mesoscopic conductor coupled to normal reservoirs , as will be discussed in sec .",
    "the experimental anomalous enhancement of noise at low temperatures can be understood by the scaling behavior : the excess noise being irrelevant at high temperatures becomes profound at low temperatures because @xmath70 increases with decreasing the temperature .",
    "note that there are other known noise sources that make the violation of the j - n relation , e.g. the background noise .",
    "the noises coming from the sources , however , can be calibrated by using the empirical method because of their trivial temperature dependences accounted for by circuit theory  @xcite and do not give an explanation for the observed discrepancy between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",

    "it is noteworthy that any number of channels of the reservoir and any interaction of the conductor , e.g. coulomb interaction , can be dealt with in this model .",
    "our measurement scheme is a simple extension of that proposed by esposito , harbola , and mukamel  @xcite .",
