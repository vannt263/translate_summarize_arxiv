    "the field - theoretic approach to critical phenomena provides us with power series expansions for the critical exponents of a wide variety of universality classes . for @xmath8-theories with o(@xmath7 ) symmetry in three dimensions ,",
    "these expansions have been calculated numerically as power series in the renormalized coupling constant up to seven loops for the critical exponents @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite and up to six loops for the exponent @xmath6 governing the approach to scaling . in @xmath11 dimensions ,",
    "exact @xmath12-expansions are available up to five loops for all critical exponents with o(@xmath7 ) symmetry @xcite , cubic symmetry , and mixtures of these @xcite .",
    "when inserted into the renormalization group equations , these expansions are supposed to determine the critical exponents via their values at an infrared - stable fixed point @xmath13 .",
    "the latter step is nontrivial since the expansions are divergent and require resummation , for which sophisticated methods have been developed , summarized and applied most recently in @xcite .",
    "the resummation methods use the information from the known large - order behavior @xmath14 of the expansions and analytic mapping techniques to obtain quite accurate results .",
    "a completely different resummation procedure was developed recently on the basis of variational perturbation theory @xcite to the expansions in powers of the _ bare coupling constant _ , which goes to infinity at the critical point .",
    "the resulting _ strong - coupling theory _",
    "@xcite was successfully applied in three @xcite and @xmath11 dimensions @xcite , and rendered for the first time an interpolation between expansions of @xmath11 and @xmath15-dimensional theories .",
    "this method converges as fast as the previous ones , even though it does not take into account the information on the large - order behavior of the expansions .",
    "instead , it uses the fact that the power series for the critical exponents approach their constant critical value in the form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 are constants , and @xmath6 is the critical exponent of the approach to scaling .",
    "the results showed that the latter information is just as efficient in increasing the speed of convergence as the information on the large - order behavior .",
    "we may therefore expect that a resummation method which incorporates both informations should lead to results with an even higher accuracy , and it is the purpose of this paper to present such a method in the form of a simple algorithm .",
    "the development of our resummation algorithm is based on an improvement of the problem formulated in @xcite and solved via variational perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the problem we want to solve is the following : let @xmath16 be the first @xmath1 terms of a divergent asymptotic expansion @xmath17 of a function @xmath18 , which possesses a strong - coupling expansion of the type @xmath19 which is assumed to have some finite convergence radius @xmath20 .",
    "suppose that the function is analytic in the complex @xmath0-plane with a cut along the negative real axis , with a discontinuity known from instanton calculations @xcite to have near the tip of the cut the generic form @xmath21 via a dispersion relation , @xmath22 or a sufficiently subtracted version of it , this discontinuity corresponds to the large - order behavior of the expansion coefficients @xmath23 @xmath24.\\ ] ] the constant @xmath25 is given by the inverse action of the radial symmetric solution to the classical field equations .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 counts the number of zero modes in the fluctuation determinant around this solution .",
    "the absolute normalization @xmath27 of the large - order behavior requires the calculation of the fluctuation determinant @xcite .",
    "as far as the leading strong - coupling coefficient @xmath28 is concerned , this problem has been attacked before by parisi @xcite using a resummation method based on borel transformations in combination with analytic mapping techniques . however , when applied to the asymptotic expansions of the ground state energy of the anharmonic oscillator , his method converged very slowly , too slow to lead to reliable critical exponents , where only five to seven expansion coefficients @xmath23 are known .",
    "the reason is that in parisi s approach , the corrections to the leading power behavior are failing to match the true fractional powers of the strong - coupling expansion ( [ stark ] ) .",
    "this deficiency was cured by the strong - coupling theory of one of the authors ( hk ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the subsequent application to critical exponents in refs .",
    "@xcite , which showed a surprisingly rapid convergence .",
    "however , that theory did not take advantage of the knowledge of the large - order behavior ( [ eq : wachs ] ) , which can lead to an increase in the speed of convergence and thus of the accuracy of theoretical values for the critical exponents .",
    "this will be done in the present improved resummation method .",
    "basis for this method is the development of a more general borel - like transformation which will automatically guarantee the form of the strong - coupling expansion ( [ stark ] ) for each approximant @xmath29 .",
    "let us first recall briefly the important properties of the ordinary borel transformations : it is a function @xmath30 associated with @xmath18 which is defined by the taylor series @xmath31 by dividing the expansion coefficients @xmath23 by @xmath32 , the factorial growth of @xmath23 is reduced to a power growth , thus giving @xmath30 a finite convergence radius .",
    "an alternative definition of the borel transform is given by the contour integral @xmath33 where the contour @xmath34 encloses anticlockwise the negative real axis .",
    "indeed , inserting here ( [ asym ] ) and performing the integral we obtain ( [ eq : boreltrans ] ) .",
    "if @xmath18 is an analytic function in the sector @xmath35 of a circle , and satisfies the so - called strong asymptotic condition @xmath36 then @xmath30 is analytic in @xmath37 , with a finite radius of convergence @xmath38 .",
    "the original function @xmath18 can be recovered from @xmath30 by the inverse borel transformation @xmath39 obviously , the inverse transformation can only be performed if @xmath30 is known on the entire positive real @xmath40-axis . the taylor series ( [ eq : boreltrans ] ) for @xmath30",
    ", however , converges only inside the circle of radius @xmath41 . before we can do the integral in ( [ eq : umkehrtrans ] )",
    ", we must therefore perform a suitable analytic continuation of ( [ eq : boreltrans ] ) @xcite .",

    "is possible to make the unit circle free of singularities .",
    "then we may use the reexpansion @xmath30 in powers of @xmath42 truncated after @xmath48 , @xmath49 as an approximation to @xmath50 on the entire positive real @xmath40 axis . inserting this into the inverse transformation formula ( [ eq : umkehrtrans ] )",

    "if the series ( [ stark ] ) has a finite radius of convergence , the large-@xmath40 expansion of @xmath30 is a divergent asymptotic one , because of the factor @xmath54 in the @xmath55-th expansion coefficient .",
    "it should be stressed , that the relation between the coefficients of the strong - coupling expansion ( [ stark ] ) and the coefficients of expansion ( [ eq : starkborel ] ) is not generally invertible , because of the factor @xmath56 which causes the coefficients of negative integer powers of @xmath40 to vanish .",
    "note that , in general , an expansion in the borel - plane with a power sequence in @xmath40 as in ( [ eq : starkborel ] ) is not sufficient to ensure an expansion in the same powers in the @xmath0-plane as in ( [ stark ] ) , because of the appearance of extra integer powers in @xmath0 .",

    "it is advantageous to perform a further analytic continuation of the reexpansion ( [ @reexpansi ] ) which enforces automatically the leading power behavior @xmath61 of @xmath30 . for this",

    "its radius of convergence is determined by the singularity on the negative real axis at @xmath78      a resummation procedure can now be set up on the basis of the transform @xmath77 as before .",
    "the inverse transformation ( [ umkehrtrans ] ) contains an integral over the entire positive axis , requiring again an analytic continuation of the taylor expansion of @xmath77 beyond the convergence radius .",
    "the reason for introducing the transform @xmath79 was to allow us to reproduce the complete power sequence in the strong - coupling expansion ( [ stark ] ) , with a leading power @xmath65 and a subleading sequence of powers @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "this is achieved by removing a factor @xmath82 with @xmath83 from the truncated series ( [ modbor ] ) of our transform @xmath77 .",
    "furthermore by removing a second simple prefactor of the form @xmath84 we weaken the leading singularity in the hyper - borel complex @xmath85-plane , which determines the large order behavior ( [ eq : wachs ] ) .",
