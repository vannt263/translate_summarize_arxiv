    "this reduction is quite reasonable because of the subtraction procedure applied before the fourier transformation .",
    "the lower scale for the fourier spectrum for sample c ( fig .",
    "[ fig:6]c ) is probably due to a smaller amplitude of the oscillations in the phase boundary . for the double loop ( sample a , b and c )",
    ", supplementary peaks are clearly distinguished in between the harmonics ( see inset in fig . [ fig:6]a , [ fig:6]b , [ fig:6]c and [ fig:7]a ) , which are considerably weaker in the reference sample r. these peaks can be due to the coupling with the supercurrent in the inner loop . comparing the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig:6]b and fig .",
    "[ fig:6]d , we note that the supplementary peaks are substantially sharper and higher for sample b than for sample r.    the period of the lp oscillations for the outer loop is @xmath95=0.525 mt and @xmath96=0.550 mt for sample a , b and r and for sample c , respectively , corresponding to the first harmonic peak at @xmath94 .",
    "the periodicity of the @xmath23 oscillations for the inner loop ( samples a and b ) is @xmath97=2.6 mt , which is approximately 5 times larger than @xmath98 , since the surface of the inner loop is approximately 5 times smaller than the one of the outer loop .",
    "this periodicity is in good agreement with the measurement on sample b ( fig . [ fig:6]b ) , where four peaks are indeed observed between the first and the second harmonic , thus indicating a five times smaller frequency compared to the frequency of the @xmath23 oscillations of the outer loop . the @xmath23 measurements on sample a show two pronounced peaks between each harmonic ( fig .",
    "[ fig:6]a and [ fig:7]a ) .",
    "this suggests a period for the inner loop @xmath99 which is in disagreement with the dimensions of sample a. for sample c , which has a slightly different size , the periodicity of the inner loop oscillations in @xmath23 is @xmath75=2.1 mt@xmath100 .",
    "this periodicity is in agreement with the measurements where three peaks are clearly observed before the first harmonic ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:6]c ) .",
    "the reason of the disagreement between the periodicity of the oscillations and the peaks in the fourier spectrum of sample a can be a different effective surface . to calculate the periodicity of the oscillations of the inner and outer loop , the average size of the loops ( through the middle of the wires ) has been used .",
    "it is possible that we have to take a slightly smaller or larger effective surface for sample a. the dimensions of samples a and b may also be not exactly the same .",
    "but the effective surface has to be taken larger than the largest dimensions of the inner loop to obtain a value of @xmath99 .",
    "we therefore think that the smaller peaks might be hidden , and not clearly seen however in the fourier spectrum . in that case , a value for the periodicity of 6 times the periodicity of the inner loop is more realistic for sample a. coming back to fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we can see that the interval ( between 5 and 24 @xmath25 ) , where a fourier transform was performed for sample a , b and r , corresponds only to 3 or 4 periods @xmath101 .",
    "the resolution of the fourier spectrum in the low frequency regime will therefore be low , thus presenting an additional difficulty in interpreting the intermediate peaks in the fourier spectra .",
    "the phase boundary @xmath23 of sample c is measured over a broader interval ( between -36 to 49 @xmath25 ) .",
    "this interval corresponds to more than 20 periods @xmath101 , what results in a better resolution of the fourier spectrum in the low frequency regime .    in a first approximation , with the currents @xmath50 and @xmath51 independent from each other , the mutual inductance @xmath40 can be evaluated from the amplitude of the additional peaks in the fourier spectrum .",
    "the additional energy due to the mutual inductance in eq .",
    "[ eq : freeenergy ] ( @xmath102 ) has to be of the same order of magnitude as the amplitude of the oscillations @xmath103 due to coupling in the phase boundary of the outer loop .",
    "the value for the mutual inductance can then be evaluated with the formula @xmath104 with @xmath105 the boltzmann constant .",
    "this gives @xmath106 17 ph , 13 ph and 14 ph for sample a , b and c , respectively .",
    "the average of the supercurrents @xmath50 and @xmath107 is calculated from ref@xcite , for @xmath56=0.3  @xmath59a and with the criterion for @xmath108 at 90% of @xmath58 , what correspond to a typical temperature interval of 3 mk between this criterion and the 50% criterion used for the measurements of the phase boundary .",
    "it is quite clear that the supercurrents , and thus also the mutual inductance are strongly dependent of this chosen criterion .",
    "the values calculated from eq .  [ eq : compare ] are comparable to the calculated mutual inductances from table [ table : param ] . due to the strong temperature dependent currents",
    ", only the order of magnitude of the mutual inductance can be evaluated from our measurements .    for high ( @xmath56=0.9 @xmath59a for sample",
    "a and 1.0 @xmath59a for sample c ) transport current , the peaks between the harmonics completely disappear ( not shown )",
    ". this vanishing may be due to increasing shift of @xmath23 with the applied transport current .",
    "the highest current corresponds to the case of the upper curve ( dashed - dotted line ) in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "hence , for all flux values , the inner loop is in the superconducting state at @xmath23 of the outer loop , and the phase boundaries of the two loops are not intersecting each other .",
    "there will be no sharp interruption of the supercurrent of the inner loop going from the superconducting to the normal state .",
    "therefore , the shape of the phase boundary of the outer loop can be less sensitive to the presence of the inner loop .",
    "on the other hand , once the inner loop is deep in the superconducting state , a higher supercurrent in the inner loop would be present , and this higher supercurrent would require a higher coupling . if the transport current @xmath56 is high enough , the inner loop will be always superconducting at @xmath23 of the outer loop . a discontinuity in the measured phase boundary of the outer loop",
    "is expected when the inner loop changes from a fluxoid quantum number @xmath109 to @xmath110 .",
    "however , we could not see a discontinuity in the measured phase boundaries , corresponding to a sign reversal of the supercurrent in the inner loop .",
    "we have measured the normal / superconducting phase boundary of a superconducting system consisting of two concentric mesoscopic loops , to study magnetic interactions between the two loops .",
    "the modification of the @xmath23 oscillations of the outer loop is seen in the fourier spectrum of the @xmath23 line due to the coupling between the outer and the inner loops . to interpret these observations ,",
    "we have used two different models .",
    "the first model assumes the presence of scattering imperfections in the outer loop .",
    "this model can not explain the observed evolution of the fourier spectrum with the current , although it might be applicable for a fixed weak current .",
    "the second model explains the extra peaks in the fourier spectrum by the magnetic coupling of the two loops .",
    "the systematic shift of the @xmath23 phase boundary of the outer loop with the applied current @xmath56 induces a well defined evolution of the fourier spectrum which was indeed found in our experiments .",
    "this evolution of the extra peaks in the fourier spectrum with the applied current gives an experimental evidence for the presence of the magnetic interaction between the two superconducting loops .",
    "future magnetic measurements on huge arrays of magnetically coupled loops , deeper in the superconducting state , could be helpful to reveal an enhanced magnetic coupling of both loops at lower temperatures .",
    "a inner loop made from a different superconductor with a higher critical temperature would certainly increase the magnetic coupling between the two loops .",
