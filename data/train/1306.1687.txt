    "several recent studies find evidence for growth in size of galaxies from redshift 23 to the present .",
    "evidence is especially strong for the most massive early  type galaxies which have increased in size by a factor 4.3 since z@xmath12.3 .",
    "there is also evidence that late ",
    "type systems have increased their size 2.6 times over the same z interval @xcite .",
    "scenarios have been proposed to explain this size evolution including environmentally dependent and independent processes .",
    "the most likely and accepted mechanism involves growth from dry minor mergers @xcite belived to be more efficient for increasing the size than the stellar mass of galaxies .",
    "consideration of this scenario and the fact that the number of compact objects is almost non  existent at z=0 , leads to the expectation of an increase with redshift in the number of galaxies with minor companions .",
    "however the fraction of galaxies with satellites appears to remain constant from z@xmath12 to the present @xcite .",
    "different mechanisms , depending on the galaxy mass , would be needed if secular processes are responsible for the growth in galaxy size . for the most massive galaxies , growth in size",
    "would be driven by quasar feedback which could remove huge amounts of cold gas from the central regions thereby inducing an expansion of the stellar distribution .",
    "on the other hand less massive galaxies would undergo adiabatic expansion as a consequence of mass loss driven by stellar winds and supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "in both cases a significant evolution of the velocity dispersion ( larger at high redshift ) is predicted for both small and large galaxies .",
    "the evidence so far shows only mild evolution in velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "if the observed differences are real and if they are due to environmental influences then comparisons at low redshift of the stellar mass  size relation for galaxies in different environments might shed some light on this interpretation .",
    "previous environmental studies of the stellar mass  size relation were made by comparing field and cluster early  type galaxies .",
    "most of them find no dependence of the stellar mass  size relation with environment at both local @xcite and high redshift @xcite . however , found a different stellar mass  size relation for cluster and field galaxies at redshift @xmath11 .",
    "cluster early  type galaxies seem to be located closer to the stellar mass  size relation at z=0 than those located in low density environments , which present smaller sizes at high  redshift .",
    "in addition @xcite found that early  type systems in higher density regions tend to be more extended than their counterparts in low  density enviroments . in the case of late  type galaxies @xcite find evidence for environmental dependence on the stellar mass  size relation .",
    "however this evidence is marginal ( 2@xmath4 ) and only for intermediate / low stellar masses .",
    "the most massive spirals follow the same stellar mass  size relation in field and cluster environments .",
    "they claim that there is a population of spirals containing extended disks only in the field .    although minor mergers are the most popular explanation for the growth of galaxies in size , a dependence with environment is not clearly established , as we have seen before . moreover , since the growth in size is stronger for massive early  type galaxies , the effect of environment should be larger for these objects . however , only spirals present a ( weak ) dependence with environment .",
    "since field usually includes pairs and even groups of galaxies , interactions may have played an important role in the results found in previous studies . at this point",
    "a well defined environment can be crucial .",
    "while it is easy to recognize a rich cluster , definitions of low  density environments can be confusing . in recent years",
    "there has been an increased emphasis on identifying low density or isolated galaxy populations .",
    "one of the most useful samples remains the visually selected catalog of isolated galaxies ( cig ) compiled by @xcite , more recently vetted as the amiga sample ( analysis of the interstellar medium of isolated galaxies , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "amiga galaxies show different physical properties than galaxies in denser environments ( even field galaxies ) , including a lower infrared luminosity ( l@xmath5@xmath0 10.5 l@xmath6 ) and colder dust temperature , a low level of radio continuum emission dominated by mild disk star formation , no radio active galactic nuclei ( agn ) selected using the radio  far infrared correlation and a small number of optical agn , less molecular gas , or a smaller fraction of hi asymmetries .",
    "in addition , early  type galaxies in amiga are fainter than late types , and most amiga spirals host pseudo  bulges rather than classical bulges , as well as different level of optical asymmetry , clumpiness and concentration @xcite .",
    "the comparison of colors between amiga and pairs of galaxies has shown a passive star formation and a gaussian distribution of colors for isolated galaxies , while the galaxies in pairs present bluer colors and higher color dispersions , which is indicative of a star formation enhanced by interactions .",
    "if environment is affecting the growth in size of galaxies , might isolated galaxies be smaller than other galaxies because they had undergone fewer minor mergers ? tried to answer this question by comparing the distribution in size between isolated and interacting galaxies .",
    "their results suggest that isolated galaxies are smaller than objects in interaction , but a comparison of the size as function of the stellar mass was not made in that work , which can lead to a wrong conclusion if the two samples do not have the same stellar mass distribution .    here , we propose to analyze the stellar mass  size relation for the amiga sample of isolated galaxies . in sect .",
    "2 , the sample selection and data analysis is described .",
    "the stellar mass  size relation is presented in sect . 3 , and the the discussion of the results is provided in sect .",
    "4 . finally , the conclusions are exposed in sect .",
    "5 . throughout this article",

    "b ) isolated spiral galaxies could be larger in physical size than similar objects in denser environments . in the next subsections , we investigate possibilities a and b. c ) other explanations for the difference involve sample differences and differences in data processing .",
    "the former possibility includes systematic differences in galaxy classification .",
    "the latter has been checked and minimized through the comparison shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "are isolated galaxies less massive because they live in such low  density environments ?",
    "one must consider their likely star formation history and accretion rate .",
    "in addition to internal processes , a galaxy can gain stellar mass by accretion of neighbors and by stimulation of star formation through interactions .",
    "both are less likely to play an important role in very isolated galaxies where the cross section for accretion and interaction stimulation by neighbours are assume to be low .",
    "it is known that galaxy interactions and the presence of companions are associated with enhanced star formation @xcite .",
    "@xcite were first to demonstrate an increased dispersion in b ",
    "v colors , and an excess of bluer colors among interacting galaxies .",
    "this enhancement is stronger if the luminosities of companion and host are similar @xcite .",
    "amiga galaxies were selected with an isolation criterion that increases the probability that they have had few or no major interactions in at least the last 3 gyr .",
    "results obtained in previous amiga studies point to a lower star formation rate compared to galaxies in denser environments .",
    "assuming that the star formation history of these galaxies has been passive during most of their live leads to the expectation that they may have less stellar mass than galaxies in denser environments .",
    "this may be a good qualitative explanation , however we need to quantify whether the stellar mass increase is due to sf enhancement caused by interaction .",
    "calculated an average star formation rate of 0.7m@xmath3 yr@xmath55 for the sb  sc isolated galaxies . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite derived an average enhancement of 1.9 in the sfr of galaxies in close pairs . considering this difference in the sfr during 3gyr ,",
    "we find that an isolated galaxy with @xmath2(m@xmath3)=10.5 ( the average value for the sb  sc spirals ) would only show a 5% stellar mass deficit relative to a galaxy that suffered an interaction . in section 3",
    ", we estimated that our isolated spirals show @xmath144% less stellar mass than galaxies in denser environments in order to explain the discrepancy with the relation of @xcite .",
    "an enhancement in the sfr caused by interaction with close companions can not account for a strong difference in stellar mass .",
    "this is a simple test taking into account only one interaction and only in the last 3gyr , while the life of a galaxy is much more complicated .",
    "perhaps 10% of the nair sample might involve galaxies in pairs since @xcite found that 10% of field galaxies are in pairs , while the number of pairs in amigas is effectively zero .",
    "the main environmental difference between the two samples involves the local surface density of neighbors . is the surface density around nair galaxies high enough , and are interactions in loose groups frequent enough , to explain a mass difference",
    "due to interaction induced star formation ? nevertheless , from the information we have , we only can conclude that the difference in the stellar mass  size relation is not mainly caused by a different star formation history of objects in low and dense environments .",
    "evolution in the stellar mass  size relation is usually attributed to a growth in size of galaxies caused by minor mergers @xcite . unlike the major merger rate which is higher in high density environments ,",
    "the rate of minor mergers might depend on the initial local density . in the case that galaxies in low density environments had formed with a lower number of small companions ,",
    "then these galaxies should have grown less than those in denser environments . on the other hand ,",
    "if small companions are remnants of the galaxy formation process , an environmental dependence should not be expected for the growth in size of galaxies .",
    "we find in this study that isolated galaxies have grown at the same rate as galaxies in other environments , with massive spirals growing the most .",
    "whatever the reason for the growth in size , it reflects that the same evolution has affected all galaxies . if we accept a role for minor mergers to explain the general growth of galaxies , then the small objects that have been accreted during the life of a galaxy should be remnants of the formation of that individual galaxy .",
    "in addition , the fact that isolated late  type galaxies in our sample are systematically larger than similar mass objects in other environments indicates that there is another environmental dependent process causing the larger sizes of isolated spirals .",
    "one possible explanation is that spiral galaxies in low density environments are the norm while such extended disks do not survive in higher density environments @xcite .",
    "the criteria used by @xcite for selecting the sample have two effects in our galaxies . on one hand , they do not have major companions at large distances , minimizing effects of environment at large scale ( tidal interactions , major mergers , etc ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of small companions at close distances ( satellites ) until 4 magnitudes of difference with the cig galaxy is also minimized , implying that our sample presents a deficit of local neighbors with respect to other samples .",
    "then , another possibility for the larger sizes found in this work would be that amiga galaxies have accreted more satellite galaxies and as a consequence of this local accretion have created a local deficit of satellites .    in order to check this option we studied the influence of the local environment , calculating the number of satellites in a field of projected radius r=250 kpc ( using as criterion for defining satellite , the distance at which the 80% of milky way satellites are found * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for the 207 amiga spiral galaxies with more than 80@xmath23 spectroscopic completeness in the sdss dr8 . since the sdss spectroscopic database is complete until r@xmath117.5 and our sample , until r@xmath114.5 , we consider only objects : 1 ) within 3 magnitude difference with respect to the central galaxy , and 2 ) with a difference in the recession velocity less than 1000 km / s .",
    "the same calculation was made for 336 spirals of @xcite that have more than 80@xmath23 completeness in sdss dr8 .",
    "we find that 6% of amiga spirals have one satellite ( and one galaxy with two satellites ) .",
    "in contrast 43% of the nair sample show a satellite ( 19% have two or more ) .",

    "<S> disentangling processes governing the formation and evolution of galaxies is a fundamental challenge in extragalactic research . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> the current belief that galaxies grow by the action of minor mergers makes the study of the stellar mass  size relation in different environments an important tool for distinguishing effects of internal and external processes .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this work is to study the effects of environment on the growth in size of galaxies . as part of amiga project ( analysis of the interstellar medium of isolated galaxies ) , we examine the stellar mass  size relation for a sample of the most isolated galaxies in the local universe interpreted as stellar systems where evolution has been mainly governed by internal processes . </S>",
    "<S> effects of environment on the stellar mass  size relation are evaluated by comparing our results with samples of less isolated early and late  type galaxies , as well as , for the first time , different spiral subtypes .    </S>",
    "<S> stellar masses in our sample were derived by fitting the sed of each galaxy with kcorrect . </S>",
    "<S> we used two different size estimators , the half  </S>",
    "<S> light radius obtained with sextractor and the effective radius calculated by fitting a srsic profile to the i  band image of each galaxy using galfit . </S>",
    "<S> we found good agreement between those size estimators when the srsic index fell in the range 2.5@xmath0n@xmath04.5 and 0.5@xmath0n@xmath02.5 for ( visually classified ) early and late  type galaxies respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> we find no difference in the stellar mass  size relation for very isolated and less isolated early  type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that late  </S>",
    "<S> type isolated galaxies are @xmath11.2 times larger than less isolated objects with similar mass . </S>",
    "<S> isolated galaxies and comparison samples were divided into 6 morphological ranges ( e / s0 , spirals , sb , sbc , sc , and scd  sdm ) and 5 stellar mass bins between @xmath2(m@xmath3)=[9,11.5 ] . in all cases </S>",
    "<S> the relation is better defined and has less scatter for the isolated galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that as the morphological type becomes later the galaxy size ( for a fixed stellar mass range ) becomes larger . </S>",
    "<S> for the lowest stellar mass bins @xmath2(m@xmath3)=[9,10 ] we find good agreement between sizes of amiga and comparison spirals ( both mostly composed of scd  sdm types ) . </S>",
    "<S> the isolated spiral galaxies in the high stellar mass bins @xmath2(m@xmath3)=[10,11 ] tend to be larger than less isolated galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this difference in size is found for all spiral subtypes and becomes larger when we compare fully isolated galaxies with galaxies having 2 or more satellites ( neighbors within 3 magnitudes of difference at a distance less than 250 kpc from the galaxy ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that massive spiral galaxies located in low density environments , both in terms of major companions and satellites , have larger sizes than samples of less isolated galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> hence the environment has played a role in the growth in size of massive spiral galaxies .    </S>",
