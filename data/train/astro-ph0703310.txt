    "strong evidence in favor of the existence of non - baryonic dark matter arises from different cosmological observations .",
    "the cosmic microwave backgroung ( cmb ) data  @xcite in combination with high redshift supernov   analysis  @xcite and large scale structure surveys  @xcite seem to converge on an unified cosmological model  @xcite . the non - baryonic cold dark matter ( cdm )",
    "would consist of still not detected particles , among those being the generally referred to as wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) the privileged ones . among the different possible wimps , the lightest supersymmetric particle , in most scenarii",
    ", the lightest neutralino @xmath0predicted by susy theories with r - parity conservation , stands as a well motivated candidate .",
    "+ in the last decades , huge experimental efforts on a host of techniques in the field of direct search of non - baryonic dark matter have been performed  @xcite .",
    "several detectors reached sufficient sensitivity to begin to test regions of the susy parameter space .",
    "however , wimp events have not yet been reported . besides the fact that the cross section could be very weak , the energy threshold effect combined with the use of a heavy target nucleus leads to significant sensitivity loss for relatively light wimps ( 6 gev @xmath1@xmath2@xmath140 gev ) . +",
    "as reported elsewhere  @xcite , the use of as a target nucleus is motivated by its privileged features for dark matter search compared with other target nuclei .",
    "first ,  being a spin 1/2 nucleus , a detector made of such a material will be sensitive to the spin - dependent interaction , leading to a natural complementarity to most existing or planned dark matter detectors ( @xmath3 telescopes , scalar direct detection as well as proton based spin - dependant detectors ) .",
    "in particular , it has been shown @xcite that an based detector will present a good sensitivity to low mass @xmath4 , within the framework of effective mssm models without gaugino mass unification at the gut scale  @xcite",

    "these models are compared with exclusion plots of scalar experiments and their projections .",
    "there are models , in grey , that will be very difficult to get with only a scalar approach . ]",
    "the  presents in addition the following advantages with respect to other sensitive materials for wimps detection : + - a very low compton cross - section to gamma rays , two orders of magnitude weaker than in ge : @xmath5 barns for 10 kev @xmath6-rays   + - the neutron signature made possible by the capture process : @xmath7 indeed it allows for an easy discrimination with @xmath0signal ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "this property is a key point for dark matter search as neutrons in underground laboratories are considered as the ultimate background .",
    "+ any dark matter detector should be able to separate a @xmath0event from the neutron background . using energy measurement and electron - recoil discrimination",
    ", mimac - he3 presents a high rejection for neutrons due to capture and multi - scattering of neutrons  @xcite .",
    "the mimac project propose a modular detector in which different gases ( , @xmath9 ) can be used to have a dependence on the mass of the target . the is other good target nucleus choice to have the axial interaction open , but proton based , increasing the attractiveness of the detector .",
    "the mimac detector has two different regimes of work : i ) high pressure ( 1,2 or 3 bar ) and ii ) low pressure ( 100 - 200 mbar ) .",
    "these two regimes allow us to have wimp events at high pressure and search for correlation with the galactic halo apparent movement at low pressure .",
    "this last possibility should be validated with a special read out electronics as an important step of the project .",
    "the micro time projection chambers with an avalanche amplification using a pixelized anode presents the required features to discriminate electron - recoil events with the double detection of the ionization energy and the track projection onto the anode . in order to get the electron - recoil discrimination",
    ", the pressure of the tpc should be such that the electron tracks with an energy less than 6 kev could be well resolved from the recoil ones at the same energy convoluted by the quenching factor .",
    "the electrons produced by the primary interactions will drift to the amplification region ( mesh ) in a diffusion process following the well known distribution characterized by a radius of @xmath10 ) $ ] where @xmath11 is tipically 200 @xmath12 for at 1 bar and @xmath13 is the total drift in the chamber up to the mesh .",
    "this process has been simulated with garfield and the drift velocities estimated as a function of the pressure and the electric field .",
    "a typical value of @xmath14 is obtained for @xmath15 in pure at a pressure of 1 bar . to prevent confusion between electron track projection and",
    "recoil ones the total drift length should be limited to l@xmath1615 cm . it defines the elementary cell of the detector matrix and the simulations performed on the ranges of electrons and recoils suggest that with an anode of @xmath17 the electron - recoil discrimination required can be obtained .",
    "the quenching factor is an important point that should be addressed to quantify the amount of the total recoil energy recovered in the ionization channel .",
    "no measurements of the quenching factor ( qf ) in have been reported .",
    "however , an estimation can be obtained applying the lindhard calculations  @xcite .",
    "the estimated quenching factor given by lindhard s theory for shows up to 70 % of the recoil energy going to the ionization channel for 5 kev recoil .",
    "in order to measure the qf for and we have developed at the lpsc a dedicated facility producing very light ions at a few kev energies .",
    "this facility , called source mimac , incorporates an ecr ion source coupled to a wien filter , selecting q / m , and a high voltage extraction going up to 50 kv .",
    "the characterization of the output energies is made by a separate time of flight measurements as we can see on fig.2 for the case of ions accelerated at 15 kv having a mean output energy of 3.7 kev . using this facility",
    "we can explore the ionization at very low energies for ions .",
    "we have measured by tof , five output energies going from 13.7 kev up to 3.7 kev corresponding to five values from 30 to 15 kv of accelerating voltage extraction .",
    "ionization measurements have been performed , with a standard micromegas grid in a gas chamber ( 95% of and 5% of isobutane at 1 bar ) .",
    "a linear calibration fits very well the points measured and extrapolating to even lower voltage extraction , we can estimate the maximum output energy corresponding to 10.5 kv to 800 ev .",
    "on fig.3 the spectrum of the ionization left in the chamber by at 800 ev is shown .",
    "on the same spectrum we show an internal conversion electron spectrum of during the two minutes the beam of was on .",
    "this source will allow us to get an idea of the equivalent electron energies .",
    "we can differentiate on the spectrum the peak of ionization well separated from the electronic noise .",
    "this spectrum shows clearly that we can expect to get the ionization left by recoils in a chamber up to energies lower than 1 kev using the micromegas detector technology of our collaborators at saclay  @xcite .",
