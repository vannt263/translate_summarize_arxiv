    "searching for extrasolar planets with the doppler radial velocity ( rv ) technique @xcite has been very successful . by measuring the tiny doppler shifts in the light from stars induced by the presence of orbiting planets , more",
    "than 600 planets have been discovered . while this success illustrates the power of radial velocity surveys as a tool for planet - finding , it remains a significant technical challenge to reduce systematic uncertainties to the point of detecting an earth - analog planet",
    ". continued advances in the precision determination of stellar radial velocities via spectroscopic techniques will require significant observation time with a large - aperture telescope , an optimized fiber - fed high - resolution spectrograph , and stable calibration sources .",
    "here we describe first experiments in the near infrared ( ir ) bringing together these main components , with a focus on the technical details , advantages , and challenges associated with the use of the laser frequency comb calibrator .",
    "it is now recognized that laser frequency combs ( lfc ) offer new opportunities for the highest precision astronomical spectroscopy measurements ( e.g. 1 cm / s rv , @xmath3 fractional , or @xmath06 khz at 1550 nm ) by providing a broad bandwidth , precisely tunable calibration spectrum that has an absolute accuracy traceable to the si second@xcite .",
    "the uniformly spaced , bright , and narrow features of the lfc spectrum are ideal for wavelength calibrations , while the absolute traceability of the comb allows for comparison of observations made on timescales from days to years and even from different observatories .",
    "additionally , the tunability of the comb facilitates the probing of the fine details of a spectrograph s exact spectral response , as demonstrated in a recent characterization of the harps spectrograph s focal - plane array@xcite .",
    "while several lfc - calibrators have been demonstrated in the visible spectrum@xcite , there are compelling reasons to observe in the near ir . because of their relatively low temperature , m dwarf stars , especially m4 and later , are faint in the visible but bright in the near ir ( 900 nm ",
    "1800 nm . ) these stars are very good candidates for a radial velocity survey ; m dwarf stars make up more than 60 % of the stars within 10 pc of the earth , and due to their lower mass and luminosity , the radial velocity signal induced by an earth - like planet orbiting the liquid water habitable zone of such a star is more than an order of magnitude larger than the signal induced by the earth orbiting the sun .",
    "these scientific motivations , taken together with the availability of established erbium fiber laser technology , make the h - band near ir atmospheric window ( 1.5 @xmath4 m to 1.8 @xmath4 m ) a particularly attractive region for a lfc calibrator . in this spectral region",
    "there are no well - developed calibration sources similar to the thorium - argon lamps and iodine cells employed in the visible .",
    "while progress has been made with discharge lamps@xcite and gas cells @xcite , these calibrators still exhibit the known challenges of irregular line spacing and line strength , barren regions , thermal background , line blending , and undefined aging .",
    "a lfc can overcome these issues and ultimately enable precision near ir calibrations and required instrument characterization at or below the 1 m / s level .    in this paper , we provide the experimental details of recent trial measurements in which a 25 ghz - spaced laser frequency comb was used as the wavelength calibrator for astronomical spectroscopy in the range of 1.55 @xmath4 m to 1.65 @xmath4 m .",
    "significantly , these results represent the first combination of all major components required for lfc - calibrated precision spectroscopy in the near ir , along with the first extraction of stellar rvs from this approach .",
    "several stars were observed over a few nights with the 9.2 m hobby - eberly telescope , and the starlight and lfc were simultaneously coupled to the pathfinder spectrograph@xcite .",
    "radial velocities were extracted from a limited number of spectral features with residual precision of @xmath010 m / s , on the first test with a room - temperature near ir spectrograph , highlighting the promise of these calibrators .",
    "the calibration laser frequency comb ( lfc ) is generated from the filtered spectrum of a 250 mhz passively mode - locked erbium fiber laser@xcite , similar to the one built and characterized in ref .",
    "the frequency of each optical mode is determined by the comb equation , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the laser s repetition rate , @xmath7 is the carrier - envelope offset frequency , and @xmath8 is an integer on the order of @xmath9 . to frequency",
    "stabilize the mode - locked laser ( mll ) , the frequencies @xmath6 and @xmath7 must be detected and locked .",
    "the most straightforward detection of @xmath7 requires an octave - spanning spectrum@xcite . using an er : fiber amplifier and polarization - maintaining highly nonlinear fiber@xcite , @xmath7 is detected and locked to 160 mhz by modulation of the mll s pump laser diode .",
    "the repetition rate , @xmath6 , is directly detected and locked by controlling the laser cavity length . by referencing the synthesizers to which @xmath7 and @xmath6 are locked to a global positioning system - disciplined rubidium clock , the frequencies of the laser modes are fixed with a fractional uncertainty of @xmath10 , limited by the accuracy of the clock .     and carrier - envelope offset frequency @xmath7 to a global - positioning system ( gps ) disciplined rubidium clock .",
    "light from the mode - locked laser is sent through the fabry - perot cavity ( mirrors @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) with mode - matching between the cavity and single - mode fiber provided by lenses @xmath13 .",
    "the transmitted light is amplified to 1.4 w , then sent through a second , identical fabry - perot cavity .",
    "the pulse is re - compressed and spectral broadening is achieved using 50 m of highly - nonlinear fiber ( hnlf ) .",
    "mode identification is achieved by measuring the beat of a single comb mode with a wavemeter - calibrated cw laser diode ( ld ) using a photodiode ( pd ) and radio - frequency spectrum analyzer ( rfsa ) . ]    for the calibration of the resolution @xmath14 pathfinder astronomical spectrograph we chose to use a comb mode - spacing of 25 ghz , yielding one comb line every 6.5 resolution elements . to generate a spectrum with this spacing using our 250 mhz mode - locked laser ,",
    "the fabry - perot mode - filtering scheme@xcite is employed .",
    "two identical filter cavities are constructed , using mirrors with reflectivity of 99.8% and radii of curvature 5 cm and 10 cm spaced by @xmath15 cm for a free - spectral range of 25 ghz and finesse of approximately 2000 . to provide fine , high - speed length tuning of the cavity length ,",
    "one mirror in each cavity is glued to a ring - shaped piezoelectric transducer ( pzt ) .",
    "the cavities are coupled to standard single - mode fiber ( smf ) using pigtailed collimators and two additional lenses for mode - matching , allowing a fiber - to - fiber coupling efficiency of @xmath16 .",
    "generation of the 25 ghz calibration spectrum proceeds as in ref .",
    "@xcite and is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : laserdrawing ] .",
    "the two identical filter cavities are used to select a subset of modes with spacing of 25 ghz , and cascaded optical amplifiers placed between the cavities provide the gain required to attain the 300 mw of power required for nonlinear broadening of the lfc . after filtering and amplification ,",
    "the 25 ghz comb light is compressed to a @xmath0300 fs pulse using dispersion - compensating fiber and launched into highly nonlinear fiber ( hnlf)@xcite . a number of different hnlfs were tested , and spectra recorded at different input powers are reported in fig . [",

    "the best results were achieved by use of 50 m of the `` hnlf-2 '' fiber for generation of the calibration spectrum . finally , to resolve the ambiguity in the mode - number of the filtered comb modes a heterodyne measurement between a single mode of the filtered comb and a wavemeter - calibrated continuous - wave ( cw ) laser is performed .",

    "after testing in the nist laboratories in boulder , colorado , the laser frequency comb - based calibrator was transported to the mcdonald observatory in southwest texas where it was used to calibrate the pathfinder spectrograph at the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) .",
    "the pathfinder spectrograph is a prototype fiber - fed near - ir spectrograph with resolution @xmath17 operating from 1 - 1.8 @xmath4m@xcite .",
    "the spectrograph is assembled on an optical breadboard inside a passively stable room - temperature enclosure with a liquid nitrogen cooled hgcdte detector array having 1024 @xmath18 1024 pixels on an 18.5 @xmath4 m pitch ( hawaii-1 hgcdte astronomical wide area infrared imager . ) to reduce the thermal background from the warm optics , cascaded cold edge - pass filters inside the detector dewar are used to reject out - of - band radiation .",
    "three 300 @xmath4 m core multimode fibers , potted in epoxy and polished one atop the other , feed the spectrograph .",
    "one fiber carries light from the telescope , while the other two are used for calibration .",
    "the spectrograph s resolution is set by use of a 100 @xmath4 m entrance slit , cross - dispersed and imaged into 4.4 pixels of the focal - plane array . for the demonstration of the lfc calibrator",
    ", the angles of the spectrograph gratings were adjusted away from their designed y - band positions for operation in the h - band . in this configuration , fractions of three echelle orders",
    "were imaged onto the focal - plane array , covering a total of 22.5 nm of spectral bandwidth between 1537 nm and 1627 nm .",
    "the drift of the spectrograph was measured during the run using both uranium - neon lamp lines and the lfc , and is typically hundreds of meters per second per day . because the telescope and calibration fibers closely track each other , this drift has been shown to limit rv precision only at levels below 3 m / s @xcite .    the laser frequency comb , which consists of a 2.5 ft@xmath184 ft optical breadboard floating on vibration - isolating air legs and 19 inch electronics rack ( see fig . [ fig : hetfig](b ) ) , was set up in the spectrograph room of the het , adjacent to the thermal and acoustic enclosure housing pathfinder .",
    "calibration light was coupled from the single - mode fiber output of the lfc into a 300 @xmath4 m core fiber using a 4 inch diameter ptfe ( teflon ) integrating sphere with an internal baffle .",
    "although the power loss through the integrating sphere was roughly a factor of @xmath19 , there was sufficient light available for the spectrograph .",
    "the 300 @xmath4 m fiber output from the integrating sphere was then sent to the pathfinder calibration bench , where an arrangement of beamsplitters ( see fig . [",
    "fig : hetfig](a ) ) allowed for the illumination of the spectrograph s two 300 @xmath4 m calibration fibers with combinations of the lfc and hollow - cathode u / ne and th / ar lamps . using this capability , an _ in situ _ measurement of the spectrum from 1454 nm to 1638 nm of a hollow cathode u / ne lamp was made using the lfc and pathfinder spectrograph@xcite .",
    "the data for this measurement were collected in only a few hours , demonstrating the strength of the lfc as a calibration tool for astronomical spectroscopy .    an additional configuration allowed for the coupling of comb light into a multimode fiber routed to a position near the prime focus of the het , where it could illuminate a screen used for flat - field calibration of the science fiber .",
    "the high power of the lfc combined with the various configurations of illumination of the three spectrograph fibers provided a means of cross - checking the quality of spectra obtained using the different spectrograph fibers .",
    "while not studied in detail in these preliminary experiments , we envision taking advantage of this flexibility in the future to examine and reduce systematic effects related to time - varying pointing errors , non - uniform mode excitation ( modal noise ) , and the speckle - type pattern from the coherent lfc calibrator .    in the present experiments",
    "it was seen that modal noise @xcite , which is the changing illumination of the detector resulting from the interference of the finite number of excited optical modes in the 300 @xmath4 m fibers , limited the attainable rv precision to @xmath0 10 m / s . to mitigate the effect of modal noise , we employed the integrating sphere for coupling the single - mode laser light into the 300 @xmath4 m optical fiber and a commercial paint mixer for active fiber agitation . in spite of these efforts , modal noise still dominated all other limitations on rv precision , such as point - spread function changes due to the pupil illumination of the telescope , detector response , the signal - to - noise ratio , and the number of stellar lines .",
    "more details about the impact of modal noise on measurements with the lfc are presented in section 5.1 of ref .",
    "the particular issue of coupling single spatial mode frequency comb light to the multimode fibers and spectrograph is a new aspect of this problem which will require further investigation .",
    "the frequency comb was operated together with the pathfinder instrument at the het over a two week period . over this time",
    ", the calibration spectrum had a constant envelope and power output , and the filter cavities could be locked to transmit the same 25 ghz subset of modes .",
    "the long - term stability of the comb freqencies was determined by the rb clock , which was measured at nist both before and after the experiment to have fractional absolute accuracy of @xmath20 .    during the observation run ,",
    "648 spectra were recorded with 5 minute integration times , of which 91 were of astronomical objects , including the stellar targets hd16873 , sigma draconis , vega , eta cassiopeae , and upsilon andromeda .",
    "useful spectra were obtained on three nights with good weather and seeing , and three nights with variable conditions . during these measurements ,",
    "the comb operated without fault , although adjustments to the servos were required before each night . a typical spectral image for hd16873 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hetfig](c ) and extracted spectra are presented in [ fig : hetfig](d ) .",
    "as seen in the figures , the comb provides a uniform grid of calibration markers with high signal - to - noise for each echelle order .",
    "the simultaneously recorded science spectra show both absorption features intrinsic to the stellar atmosphere as well as sharp telluric co2 lines from the earth s atmosphere .",
    "radial velocities of the known stable star eta cassiopeae , obtained with the comb as the simultaneous reference to track instrument drift , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rvplots ] . the derived uncertainty of each 5 minute exposure was @xmath0 30 m / s , and typically 6 - 11 such exposures were acquired back - to - back .",
    "the scatter in the data about the mean for the back - to - back exposures was @xmath0 28 m / s , consistent with the uncertainty attributed to each exposure . the dominant limitation on precision is again modal noise , and is was seen to average down when the back - to - back exposures were combined .",
    "this indicates that the modal noise is not static , but changes on a time - scale similar to the 5 minute exposure time .",
    "all of the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : rvplots ] are derived from the analysis of a single echelle order , and in spite of modal noise limitations show an h - band rv precision of @xmath0 10 m / s , a level competitive in the nir ( with an uncooled instrument testbed ) . while improvements in data reduction are ongoing and full details of the rv analysis will be provided in a future publication , these preliminary results are very encouraging and motivate the further development and optimization of high - precision infrared frequency comb spectroscopy .",
    "in summary , we present the first reported calibration of stellar spectra using a laser frequency comb and a high - resolution fiber - fed infrared astronomical spectrograph . in laboratory measurements ,",
    "the comb was shown to have absolute accuracy of better than @xmath21 from 1450 nm to 1630 nm , corresponding to a radial velocity precision of better than 6 cm / s . using the laser frequency comb as calibrator",
    ", observations of stellar targets were made with the pathfinder astronomical spectrograph , allowing for radial velocity precision of 5 - 15 m / s .",
    "the lessons learned in this work provide the basis for development of a lfc for the new , facility - class habitable zone planet finder@xcite spectrograph , covering the y , j , and h bands from 0.95 @xmath4 m to 1.70 @xmath4 m .",
    "the combined advances in laser technology and astronomical spectrographs should enable 1 m / s calibration precision in the infrared , which will provide a new tool for exoplanet surveys of the numerous population of m dwarf stars .",
