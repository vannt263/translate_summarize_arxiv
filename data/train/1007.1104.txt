    "electronic transport through nanoscale systems exhibits many important new features in comparison with conduction through macroscopic systems .",
    "in particular local interactions , such as coulomb interactions between the electrons and scattering from localized atomic vibrations , become critically important . in crude terms , these effects are more important in nanoscale systems as the electronic probability density is concentrated in a small region of space ; normal screening mechanisms are thus ineffective .",
    "it is most useful to have a simple expression for the electronic current or for the conductance of a nanoscale object connected to terminals .",
    "this is provided in the form an appealing intuitive physical picture by the landauer formula@xcite , which describes the current in terms of the transmission coefficients of the central scattering region and of distribution functions of the electrons in the terminals . however , in its original form the landauer formula deals only with non - interacting electrons .",
    "this formalism has been used in conjunction with density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations for realistic nanoscale systems @xcite and has helped tremendously for the qualitative understanding of the transport properties of such realistic systems .",
    "the apparent success of such approaches relies on the fact that dft maps the many - electron interacting system onto an effective non - interacting single - particle kohn - sham hamiltonian suited for the landauer formalism for transport .",
    "however when such a mapping becomes questionable for strongly - interacting electron systems , the original landauer approach has been found to be incomplete and unable to properly take into account the many - body effects @xcite .",
    "the landauer formula has been built upon by meir and wingreen @xcite to extend this formalism to a central scattering region containing interacting between particles .",
    "it is then expressed in terms of non - equilibrium green s functions and self - energies and in the most general cases it does not bear any formal resemblance with the original landauer formula for the current @xcite .",
    "other generalisation of landauer - like approaches to include interactions and inelastic scattering have been developed , see for example refs .",
    "it is therefore important to know the domain of validity of landauer - like approaches in comparison to exact current calculations based on non - equilibrium green s functions for treating electron transport through an interacting region connected to leads at different thermodynamical equilibria .",
    "this is the question we address in this paper by following a two step approach .",
    "first we reformulate meir and wingreen s work to once more express the current as the sum of a landauer - like expression involving a transmission coefficient , plus a non - landauer - like term arising from the non - equilibrium many - body effects .",
    "we further develop our theoretical framework to show that the interaction between particles in the central region not only renormalizes the non - equilibrium green s functions  but also the coupling at the contacts between the central region and the leads .",
    "we hence obtain a generalized landauer - like formula for the current in the same spirit as in refs .  [ ] .",
    "however our result for the dynamical functional that renormalizes the coupling at the contacts is more general than the ansatz used in previous studies ( refs .",
    "our result does not imply any constraints on the statistics of the non - equilibrium interacting central region .",
    "secondly , we apply our theoretical framework to study a model system in the presence of electron - phonon ( electron - vibron ) interactions , connected to two non - interacting electron leads at non - equilibrium .",
    "we analyze in detail the validity of landauer - like approaches to describe the conductance and the inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy ( iets ) of such a non - equilibrium many - body interacting system .",
    "the paper is organized into two main sections . in the first ( section [ sec : formalism ] )",
    "we develop our formalism to derive our generalized expression for the current .",
    "the implications of this are discussed in section [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "we then apply this formalism to the model system in section [ sec : numer - calc ] and show the results of numerical calculations .",
    "following meir and wingreen @xcite , we consider a scattering central region ( a quantum dot , a molecule , or a nanowire including interaction between particles ) which is connected to two ( left @xmath0 and right @xmath1 ) leads .",
    "these leads are described by two non - interacting fermi seas at their own equilibrium , characterized by two fermi distributions @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath4 where the summation indices @xmath5 run over the left and right leads ( @xmath6 respectively ) and depending on the choice of representation over momentum @xmath7 or lattice site @xmath8 index , with @xmath9 creating ( annihilating ) a non - interacting electron , and @xmath10 represent a complete , orthonormal set of states for the interacting electrons in the central region , and @xmath11 represent a set of bosonic degrees of freedom to which the electrons are coupled in the central region .",
    "these can be more or less extended phonons in a quantum dot or nanowire , or molecular vibrations ( vibrons ) in molecules .",
    "there are two main approximations in the meir and wingreen approach to transport .",
    "the first is to consider that the interactions are localized within the central region .",
    "this leads to specific properties for the self - energies used to calculate the non - equilibrium many - body green s functions  within the basis states of the central region only .",
    "the self - energies are then obtained as the sum of three contributions : two similar contributions arising from the electronic coupling of the central region to the left and right leads and the third arising from the interaction between particles in the central region .",
    "the second approximation is to consider that the initial correlations dies out in the long - time limit , and hence a steady state regime can be reached .",
    "it should be noted that a generalization going beyond the steady state regime has recently been given in ref .",
    "[ ] .      in the steady state , the current @xmath12 flowing at the left contact between the left lead and the central region is expressed in terms of three non - equilibrium green s functions ( the retarded @xmath13 , advanced @xmath14 and lesser @xmath15 green s functions ) of the dressed interacting central region @xcite .    using the identity @xmath16 and",

    "finally , one recovers the more conventional landauer - like formula ( with no correction factors or equivalently with no renormalization of the contact couplings ) when the quantity @xmath56 vanishes , as can be clearly seen from eqs .",

    "hence , even when the transport is well described by a landauer - like formula ( @xmath57 ) , normalization effects still occur and the transport is dominated by single - quasiparticle scattering .",
    "clearly whenever @xmath59 , there is no renormalization at the contact , and the current is simply given by @xmath45 .",
    "this may happen in two cases : either @xmath60 for all @xmath61 or only within finite range(s ) of @xmath61 .",
    "in the latter case , the relevant range of @xmath61 for which @xmath62 should be included within the bias window defined by the two fermi levels @xmath63 and @xmath64 at non equilibrium .    in order to understand how and why the quantity @xmath65 can vanish for an interacting system ,",
    "let us first come back to the definition of the lesser and greater self - energies .",
    "these are specific components ( projections onto the real time axis ) of the more general self - energy  @xmath66 with times @xmath67 defined on the keldysh time - loop contour @xcite . within the keldysh approach , the lesser @xmath68 ( greater @xmath69 ) components of @xmath66",

    "@xmath71 is simply the fourier transform of @xmath72 in the limit of the steady - state regime where any quantity depends only on the time difference @xmath73 .",
    "first let us examine the first case : why would a self - energy have no lesser or greater components ? for the so - called irregular self - energies  @xcite , we have the condition @xmath74 .",
    "the self - energies for the interaction are instantaneous ( local ) in time .",
    "hence they can not have lesser or greater components , since the times have to be on the same time - loop branch .",
    "this condition of locality in time corresponds to two classes of physical effets .",
    "first when the self - energies  describe one - particle potentials due to electron - electron or electron - phonon interaction , in other words it corresponds to the hartree - fock approximation for electron - electron interaction and to only the hartree - like approximation for electron - phonon interaction .",
    "and second when the self - energies  correspond to the so - called initial correlations which contain all contributions singular in time ( see for example refs .",
    "there is also another class of problems for which there are no lesser or greater components of the self - energy .",
    "it is when the exchange and correlation effects for interacting electron systems are represented by an effective potential @xmath75/\\delta n(r , t)$ ] being obtained from an exchange - correlation action functional @xmath76 $ ] of the electron density @xmath77 . to this potential",
    "will correspond an effective self - energy that is local in both space and , more importantly , in time @xcite ; hence with no lesser and greater components for a generalization onto the keldysh contour .    in effect , any method which maps an interacting electron / phonon system onto an effective one - particle ( quasi - particle ) scheme as for example in density - functional based technique ( dft , tddft ) or other mean - field approaches , will end up with no lesser and greater components for the corresponding self - energy describing the interaction .",
    "hence a landauer - like approach to the transport is entirely appropriate for such methods @xcite .",
    "however the mapping onto a one - particle scheme may not describe well strongly correlated electronic systems , @xmath76 $ ] being amenable to approximation , or is simply not possible in the general case of electron - phonon interaction .",
    "now , let us turn to the second case : the interaction spectral density @xmath78 vanishes for one or more ( connected ) ranges of @xmath61 values .",
    "if this gap in @xmath79 is enclosed within the bias window then again , the current @xmath36 will be determined only by the landauer - like term @xmath45 .    as will be shown in detail below from numerical calculations for a model system",
    ", such a gap in @xmath79 may exist in special cases of electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the gap in @xmath79 is then usually located around the fermi level at equilibrium , and around the fermi levels for the non - equilibrium cases at low applied bias only .",
    "these cases correspond to the regime studied by imry _",
    "@xcite who derived a landauer - like inelastic transmission for interacting electron - phonon systems and argued that the landauer picture is still valid in the presence of interaction as long as multi - particle processes can be neglected .    for electron - electron interactions ,",
    "the situation is somewhat different . even if collective excitations like plasmons present some qualitative bosonic analogy to phonons ( there is a peak in the self - energy  around the plasmon energy  as for the e - ph self - energy",
    "and no much interaction spectral density elsewhere ) , there is always however a non - zero contribution to the self - energy  coming from the continuum of electron - hole excitations .",
    "the main difference from the electron - phonon interaction is that the phonon frequency @xmath80 imposes a restricted energy scale on the interaction , while for electron - electron interaction all energy scales are available , making the corresponding interaction self - energy not vanishing , except in a infinitely small energy window around the fermi energy at equilibrium .",
    "so in principle , landauer - like approaches for interacting electron systems are not valid for interactions treated beyond the mean - field / density - functional - based approximations @xcite .",
    "finally , one should note that the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : i_landauer+corrections_withfneint ] ) for the current , or the second term in the renormalization function @xmath81 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) involves the quantity @xmath82 which is , in a series expansion of the interaction , proportional to the powers of the coupling constant(s ) characterizing the interaction . in the limit of weak interactions ,",
    "these terms represent small corrections to the landauer - like current expression , and also give small contributions in the renormalization of both the green s functions  and the coupling at the contacts .",
    "hence in the limit of weak interactions , conventional landauer - like approaches could be confidently used and corrected by using perturbation theory for the interaction @xcite .",
    "now we turn to presenting numerical calculations for a model system including electron - phonon interactions to illustrate our previous analysis .",
    "we compare results obtained from the exact current expression eq .",

    "in this section , we study in detail the validity of landauer - like approaches for an interacting model system connected to two non - interacting electron reservoirs at non - equilibrium .",
    "we concentrate on a model of electron - phonon interaction with the simplest version of the hamiltonian ( eq .

    ". we also briefly describe below how to calculate the non - equilibrium green s functions ( negf ) from this model hamiltonian ; the full theoretical details can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we then apply our negf technique to the calculations of the transport properties of the junction around equilibrium and out of equilibrium , and thus for different transport regimes .",
    "we analyze in detail if and when landauer - like approaches can provide a good description of the transport properties in comparison to an exact calculation .",

    "indeed it has been shown that the inelastic features of the iets can be both peaks or dips @xcite depending on the nature of the conductor and essentially on all the parameters describing the system @xcite .    the most interesting result shown in figure",

    ", there is basically no feature at @xmath165 in the iets signal derived from the exact expression of the current , although there is a small feature in the iets signal derived from the landauer - like current expression .",
    "the absence of such a feature at @xmath165 for resonant transport is in agreement with previous studies ( refs .  [ ] ) .",
    "however at the moment there is no satisfactory physical explanation for the absence of such a feature at @xmath165 .",
    "we postulate that such an absence may be due to the partial resummation of the electron - phonon diagrams in the many - body green s functions . as we have already shown in ref .",
    "[ ] , higher - order diagrams for the interaction ( beyond hartree - fock / born approximation ) play a very important role in correctly describing the properties of the electron - phonon coupled system , even at intermediate electron - phonon couplings .",
    "in this paper , we have re - addressed the problem of the breakdown of landauer - like approaches for electronic transport in the presence of many - body interactions .",
    "starting from the original work of meir and wingreen @xcite , we have once more expressed the current as the sum of a landauer - like expression ( @xmath45 ) involving the concept of single - particle transmission probabilities plus a non - landauer - like term arising from the non - equilibrium many - body effects .",
    "we have further developed our theoretical framework to show that the interaction in the central scattering region renormalizes not only the non - equilibrium green s functions  but also the coupling at the contacts between the central region and the leads .",
    "we have hence obtained a new form of generalized landauer - like formula for the current , eqs.([eq : i_landauerlike_with_contactrenorm]-[eq : lambda ] ) , in a similar way to refs .",
    "however our result for the dynamical functional that renormalizes the coupling at the contacts is more general than the ng ansatz @xcite used in refs .",
    "moreover our result does not impose any constraints on the statistical properties of the non - equilibrium interacting central region .",
    "we have then applied our theoretical framework to a model system of electron - vibron interacting nanojunction .",
    "we have analyzed in detail the domain of validity of landauer - like approaches , i.e. without renormalization of the contacts , to describe the conductance and the inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy ( iets ) of such a non - equilibrium many - body interacting system .",
    "our results confirm that generally landauer - like approaches are not adequate to describe the transport properties of such interacting systems for the whole range of applied biases ( linear to highly non - linear regime ) and for all the transport regimes ( good , metallic - like to mediocre , insulator - like conductors ) . in general , the correct transport properties",
    "are only obtained from exact non - equilibrium many - body green s function  calculations .",
    "however , there exist a certain number of conditions in which a landauer - like approach can reproduce fairly well either the conductance or the iets signal . for example , renormalization of the green s functions  in a landauer - like approach is already sufficient to account qualitatively for the inelastic features in the iets signal for the resonant transport regime , i.e. @xmath45 gives features at @xmath80 in the iets signal .",
    "however this is not the case for the off - resonant transport regime , for which the landauer - like current @xmath45 fails to reproduce the inelastic features in the iets signal .",
    "finally , we believe that higher order diagrams , as studied in ref .  [ ] , may change the detailed features of the iets signal , especially for higher energy excitations .",
    "however the accuracy to / with which the green s functions  are calculated ( born approximation / hartree - fock or beyond ) does not alter the main conclusions of our work concerning the applicability of landauer - like current formula versus exact derivation of the current .",
    "this work was funded in part by the european community s seventh framework programme ( fp7/2007 - 2013 ) under grant agreement no 211956 ( etsf e - i3 grant ) .",
    "in order to keep the formalism simple , let us first consider that the green s functions  and the corresponding self - energies  are simply complex functions of @xmath61 , i.e. we are dealing with an interacting central region containing only one site / one electronic level ( sssm model ) .",
    "when the system is at equilibrium ( @xmath167 ) , the lesser ( greater ) green s function  is related to the advanced and retarded green s functions  : @xmath168 and @xmath169 these relationships are at the center of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem for equilibrium .",
    "they can also be recast as follows , @xmath170 and they then define a relationship between the greater and lesser green s functions for statistical averages in the grand canonical ensemble at finite temperature ( the so - called kubo - martin - schwinger boundary conditions @xcite ) .",
    "similar relationships also exist for the self - energies  @xmath171 ( see for example ref .  [ ] ) .    for non - equilibrium conditions , there is no unique fermi level at finite bias ( or no unique temperature if @xmath172 ) in the whole system , and the relationships given above by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : glesser_equi]-[eq : glessgreat_kms ] ) no longer hold .",
    "this is an important feature of the non - equilibrium formalism for which conventional equilibrium statistics need to be reformulated @xcite .",
    "however , the self - consistent calculations of the green s functions  and self - energies  in the non - equilibrium  case permit us to define new non - equilibrium  distributions .",
    "for example , the non - equilibrium distribution @xmath173 is defined from the green s functions  as follows : @xmath174 this definition is reminiscent of the so - called kadanoff - baym ansatz which has been generalized to the non - equilibrium conditions and to the time representation of the green s functions   ( see for example refs . [ ] ) .",
    "similarly , we also define the non - equilibrium distribution @xmath55 from the interaction self - energies  as follows : @xmath175    there is no _ a priori _ reason for these two non - equilibrium  distribution functions to be equal to each other at non - equilibrium .",
    "both distribution functions contain information about both the non - equilibrium  and the many - body interaction effects in the system @xcite however , at equilibrium , these distribution functions are as expected equal to each other and to the conventional fermi - dirac equilibrium statistics @xmath176 .    as an example , the non - equilibrium distribution function @xmath177 for a non - interacting system @xcite is given by the weighted averaged of @xmath178 by the coupling at each contact @xmath179 : @xmath180    the asymptotic values of distribution functions are defined from behavior of the green s functions  and self - energies  at large @xmath61 , and follow the conventional statistics : @xmath181 at equilibrium , one recovers the equilibrium statistics for any distribution function @xmath182 .",
    "now , we can generalize our formalism to central regions containing several electronic states .",
    "the distribution functions then become matrices @xmath183 @xcite with elements @xmath184 given by @xmath185 where @xmath186 is either a green s function  @xmath187 or a self - energy  @xmath188 , and the indices @xmath189 are appropriate indices to label the electronic states of the central region .",
    "here again , we consider in the following mathematical developments that the green s functions  and the self - energies  are simply complex functions . extension to matrices is rather straightforward but",
    "must be done with care using the notations and definitions given in the main text and in appendix [ app : distribution_fnc ] .    using the definition of @xmath55 : @xmath190 and the fact that @xmath191",
    ", we find after more formal manipulations that the renormalization functional @xmath81 ( eq .  ( [ eq : lambda ] ) )",
    "can be re - expressed as : @xmath192 after noticing that @xmath193 , we can finally obtain a compact form for @xmath81 : @xmath194 which is another way of expressing the important result of this paper given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) .",
    "now we are going to relate our principal results to previous studies using the ng ansatz @xcite .",
    "the ng ansatz , developed to study the anderson model out of equilibrium @xcite , is based on using an apparently more convenient way to express the full lesser ( greater ) self - energy  in terms of the lesser ( greater ) self - energy  for the non - interacting system : @xmath195 where @xmath196 and @xmath34 , and @xmath197 is a dynamical `` renormalization '' quantity , to be determined from the condition @xmath198 .",
    "we will show below that this ansatz actually implies strong constraints on the statistics on the non - equilibrium interacting systems .    by using the ng ansatz to express the lesser and greater self - energies  @xmath71 in eq.([eq : newlambda_2 ] ) , one can easily see that our renormalization functional @xmath81 given by eq.([eq : newlambda_2 ] ) is just equal to the dynamical quantity @xmath199 of the ng ansatz : @xmath200 .",
    "we then recover all the expressions for the current previously derived in refs .",
    "[ ] from our main results eqs .",
    "( [ eq : i_landauerlike_with_contactrenorm]-[eq : lambda ] ) .",
    "however , the ng ansatz presents some intrinsic limitations . to prove this , it is sufficient to calculate the non - equilibrium  distribution function @xmath38 within the ng ansatz .",
    "starting from the definition of @xmath55 , i.e. @xmath201 it is straightforward to show that @xmath38 is then given by @xmath202 the non - equilibrium   distribution function for the non - interacting system !    just to confirm the consistency of our derivations , if we use the above result @xmath203 in the definition of our renormalization functional @xmath81 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) and the ng ansatz for @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath204 , we find again and consistently that @xmath205 , as expected",
    ".    however we have found @xcite that the condition @xmath203 implies necessarily that @xmath206 . in other terms",
    ", the ng ansatz implies that the full non - equilibrium  distribution @xmath207 of the interacting system , as well as @xmath38 , are equal to the non - equilibrium  distribution function for the non - interacting system !",
    "this is a condition that is in contradiction with the fact that both distribution functions should simultaneously include both the non - equilibrium  effects and the many - body interaction effects .",
    "in fact @xmath173 is actually a functional of both the non - equilibrium  distribution function for the non - interacting @xmath177 and the many - body interaction @xcite .",
    "hence we conclude that our expression for the renormalization of the coupling at the contact @xmath81 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) is more general than the definition used in the ng ansatz .",
    "the latter is not taking fully into account the interaction effects at non equilibrium .",
    "it actually corresponds to a lowest - order expansion of the full non - equilibrium  distribution in terms of only the non - equilibrium  distribution function of the non - interacting system @xcite . or",
    "in other words , the ng ansatz considers that the statistics of the interacting central region is dominated by that of the non - interacting leads at non - equilibrium , and that the interaction effects in the central region do not affect its non - equilibrium  statistics .",
    "finally we would like to mention that it is however possible to recover the ng ansatz from our results in the limit of low - energy scales @xcite , i.e. when @xmath208 and then @xmath209 .",
    "this implies that although approximate , the ng ansatz might be good enough to describe low - energy excitations like , for example , the kondo effect in correlated electron systems , which gives a sharp feature in the spectral density around the fermi level at equilibrium , or split kondo peaks around the leads fermi levels at non equilibrium @xcite .",
    "however , such an ansatz will most probably fail to describe systems for which the interaction ( electron - phonon , electron - plasmon ) is restricted on an energy scale defined by the phonon ( plasmon ) frequency , which is finite and not necessarily small @xcite ."
