    "the observations on sn ia @xcite show that our universe is in a stage of accelerating expansion . in order to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe ,",
    "many dark energy models are constructed . in many fashioned models ,",
    "some strange fields are introduced to effectively describe the behaviors of the dark energy .",
    "there are alternative approaches to describe the dark energy .",
    "for example , the gravitational lagrangian is supposed to be @xmath0 and so on . however , such kind of the gravitational lagrangian is also a phenomenological one .",
    "there is no fundamental principle to determine the function @xmath1 .    on the other hand , since 1970s , some efforts to construct a new gravitational theory  the gravity with local de sitter ( ds ) symmetry",
    " have been made @xcite .",
    "a model of ds gauge theory of gravity can be formulated inspired by the ds invariant special relativity @xcite and the principle of localization @xcite .",
    "this is just like the poincar gauge theory of gravity ( see , e.g.@xcite ) , which can be inspired by the einstein special relativity and the localization of poincar symmetry .",
    "the principle of localization requires that the full symmetry  @xmath2 for einstein special relativity , @xmath3 for ds invariant special relativity and @xmath4 for anti - ds ( ads ) invariant special relativity  as well as the laws of dynamics are both localized .",
    "it has been shown that the model of ds gauge theory of gravity can be realized on a kind of totally umbilic submanifolds and under the ds - lorentz gauge , the ds connection becomes the gravitational gauge potential of the model , which combines the lorentz tetrad and connection together as an @xmath5 valued connection .",
    "the gravitational action takes the form of yang - mills gauge theory .",
    "after variation of the action with respect to the lorentz tetrad and connection , one may obtain the einstein - like equations and yang - like equations , respectively .",
    "the yang - like equations are the generalization of the gravitational field equations in the theory of gravity proposed by yang @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "they consist of a set of highly non - linear equations .",
    "to solve the equations is , in general , a very difficult task .",
    "fortunately , it can be shown that all vacuum solutions of einstein field equations with a cosmological constant are the vacuum solutions of the set of equations without torsion @xcite .",
    "in particular , schwarzschild - ds and kerr - ds metrics are two solutions of the model of ds gauge theory of gravity .",
    "therefore , the model of ds gauge theory of gravity can pass all solar - system - scale observations and experimental tests for general relativity .",
    "in addition , there exist torsion - free and spin current - free , big bang solutions in the model of ds gauge theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the equation of state ( eos ) for the perfect fluid in the solutions has to take , up to a constant , the form of radiation , namely , @xmath6 .",
    "obviously , such kind of cosmological solutions can not explain the evolution of the universe .",
    "the stringent requirement comes from the nontrivial yang equation in addition to einstein - like equations .",
    "one of the purposes of the present paper is to show that when an isotropic and homogeneous torsion is taken into account , an arbitrary form of eos for matter may be supplemented to the einstein - like equations and yang - like equations and thus the diverse cosmological solutions may be constructed , which may be used to explain the evolution of the universe .",
    "for example , we may find a series of ` dust - dominated ' cosmological solutions . in the cosmological solutions",
    "the contributions of the higher order of curvature term and torsion term automatically serve as the dark energy and dark radiation . hence , it is not necessary to introduce strange fields to describe the dark energy .",
    "another purpose of the paper is to investigate what kind of ingredients of gravitational dark energy in the model may fit the sn ia observation data .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "we first review the model of ds gauge theory of gravity in the next section . in the third section ,",
    "we show that the torsion - free and spin current - free solutions in a large class of gravitational theories containing quadratic terms of curvature and torsion can not explain the evolution of the universe and that the torsion is necessary for the purpose , at least , in the model of ds gauge theory of gravity . in sec .",
    "[ sect : figure ] , we present some numerical solutions for the homogeneous and isotropic universe with torsion . also in this section , we try to fix the ingredients of gravitational dark energy by comparing with the sn ia observation data .",
    "we shall give some concluding remarks in the final section .",
    "like the poincar gauge theory of gravity @xcite in which the full poincar symmetry of a minkowski spacetime is localized , the model of ds gauge theory of gravity can be stimulated by that gravity should be based on the idea of the localization of the full ds - symmetry of a ds spacetime and its dynamics is supposed to be governed by a gauge - like one with a dimensionless coupling constant @xmath7 . in the following we shall review how to construct a model of ds gauge theory of gravity on a kind of totally umbilic submanifolds of local ds - invariance and in a special gauge called the ds - lorentz gauge the ds connection becomes the one proposed earlier in @xcite .",
    "the model of ds gauge theory of gravity @xcite supposes that the spacetimes with gravity of local -invariance is described as a kind of @xmath8-dimensional totally umbilic submanifolds @xmath9 as sub - manifolds of @xmath10-dimensional riemann - cartan manifolds @xmath11 . in surface theory",
    "@xcite , a surface is totally umbilic if the normal curvatures at each point are constants .",
    "a sphere in 3-dimensional euclid space is an example of a totally umbilic surface .",

    "the reason that up to a constant , the eos has to take almost radiation form is that the 24 components of torsion are set zero in the above model while the component equations obtained from the variation with respect to connection ( or equivalently to contortion ) do not disappear simultaneously .",

    "the space of the universe is very flat , so we may suppose that @xmath107 .",
    "figure 1 shows the evolution of scale factor for @xmath108 as argued in @xcite and @xmath109 . when @xmath110 and @xmath111 are fixed , there are still two degrees of freedom among @xmath102 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "we choose @xmath102 and @xmath115 as independent ones and fix @xmath102 first and then plot curves for different values of @xmath112 . in the figure ,",
    "the horizontal axis is time in the unit of @xmath116 and the vertical axis is @xmath117 . from the figure",
    ", we can find that in all cases considered , the larger the cosmological constant , the younger the universe is .",
    "obviously , some models have been ruled out because they can not explain the ages of the oldest globular clusters @xcite , which are between 10 and 13 gyr .",
    "but , there are still wide parameter ranges ( roughly speaking , @xmath118 ) for the models which might be used to explain the evolution of the universe .",
    "it is remarkable that the models supply a natural transit from the decelerating expansion to accelerating expansion without help of the strange fields such as quintessence , k - essence , phantom , quintom , etc .",
    "for example , when the space of the universe is a little bit curved so that @xmath119 , which has been indicated from the analysis of wmap @xcite and sdss @xcite , the model with @xmath120 behaves as @xmath121 as @xmath122 . in this case",
    ", @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 due to eqs . ( [ fried1  ] ) and ( [ depa ] ) .",
    "it means that on the large scale , the effect of torsion can not be ignored .",
    "the ratio of the energy density of torsion to the critical energy density is even greater than those for cosmological constant and matter .",

    "the transit from the decelerating expansion to the accelerating expansion occurs at @xmath126 for all models plotted.,title=\"fig : \" ] .",
    "the transit from the decelerating expansion to the accelerating expansion occurs at @xmath126 for all models plotted.,title=\"fig : \" ]    figure 2 plots the behavior of deceleration parameter versus red shift @xmath127 .",
    "we can see that the transit from the decelerating expansion to the accelerating expansion happen around at @xmath128 , which is qualitatively consistent with the analysis on the sn ia observation @xcite .",
    "the astronomical observations show that the universe is probably asymptotically ds .",
    "it suggests that there is a need to analyze the observation data based on a theory with local ds symmetry .",
    "we have shown that the torsion is vitally important in the explanation of the evolution of the universe not only for the model of ds gauge theory of gravity first proposed in 1970s , but also in a large class of gravitational theories containing quadratic terms of curvature and torsion . in a wide parameter range in the model of ds gauge theory of gravity ,",
    "the spin - current - free cosmological solutions with homogenous and isotropic torsion may explain the sn ia observation and supply a natural transit from decelerating expansion to accelerating expansion , without introducing other fields such as quintessence , k - essence , phantom , etc .",
    "the transit occurs around at @xmath128 , which is qualitatively consistent with the analysis on the sn ia observation .",
    "the reason that the redshift of the transit is systematically greater than the previous analysis is that the relation between @xmath129 and @xmath127 is obviously not linear one in our model , while the previous analysis is based on the assumption @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "if we make the linear fitting for the @xmath131 curve and then parallel transport the line so that it goes through @xmath110 at @xmath132 , then we shall get smaller redshift for the transit .    in the cosmological solutions with torsion we considered , the effects of torsion could not be ignored on the large scale , which is even greater than that of matter density or cosmological constant .",
    "even though , it is very difficult to directly measure the energy density of torsion by local experiments because its order of magnitude is the same as that of cosmological constant .",
    "it is worthwhile to study the method of detecting torsion and place the upper limit for the torsion .",
    "needless to say , to check whether the model can really explain the gravitational phenomena in the universe , much work is needed . in particular , we should perturb the frw metric and compare the anisotropic spectrum with wmap data .",
