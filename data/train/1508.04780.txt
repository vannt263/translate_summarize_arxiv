    "radio pulsars are interpreted as rapidly spinning and strongly magnetised neutron stars powered by their rotational energy . the most recent compilation ( 1.52 ) of the australia national telescope facility ( atnf ) pulsar catalogue ( manchester et al .",
    "2005 ) lists over 2300 radio pulsars . an important subgroup ( @xmath8 objects )",
    "is that of the so - called milli - second pulsars ( msps ) , characterised by very short spin periods ( @xmath0 ms ) , high spin stability ( @xmath9@xmath10 s  s@xmath11 ) , spin - down ages @xmath1210 gyrs , surface magnetic fields @xmath13@xmath14 g , and spin - down energy @xmath15@xmath16 erg s@xmath11 .",
    "a large fraction of msps ( 164 ) are in binary systems and are mostly located in the galactic plane .",
    "the fact that many msps are found in binary systems supports the commonly accepted scenario for the formation and evolution of msps ( the  _ canonical recycling scenario _  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that msps form in binary systems from old ( slowly rotating ) pulsars and that , at a later stage , they are reaccelerated to milli - second spin periods as the result of mass accretion from their non - degenerate companion stars . the pathways to the msps are different according to the initial mass ratio and orbital separation of the components , which drives the length of the accretion processes ( see , e.g. tauris 2011 , 2015 ; tauris et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "the most common pathway leads to a companion star that has almost or completely lost its external layers ( white dwarf ; wd ) orbiting a rapidly spinning pulsar @xcite . in this case",
    ", the companion star is expected to be either an he wd of mass @xmath17 or a more massive carbon - oxygen ( co ) wd , of mass @xmath18 .",
    "when the companion star has not reached the wd stage yet it may be ablated by irradiation from the pulsar relativistic wind , which possibly leads to the formation of a solitary msp .",
    "two distinct families of binary msps with non - degenerate companions emerge according to the degree of the ablation processes ( e.g. , roberts 2013 ) .",
    "the first one is that of the so - called black widow ( bw ) msps , where the companion is a very low - mass star of @xmath19 , almost fully ablated by the pulsar wind .",
    "the second one is that of the redbacks ( rb ) msps , where the companion is only partially ablated and has an higher mass of @xmath20@xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the study of msps in binary systems is fundamental to understand the final stages of the binary pulsar evolution , including the different outcomes of the recycling process ( e.g. , possenti & burgay 2008 ; possenti 2013 ) , and investigate the possible evolutionary connections between different msp types ( e.g. , benvenuto et al .",
    "in all these types of studies , the optical identification of the msp companion star plays a crucial role ( e.g. , pallanca et al .  2012 , 2013 , 2014 ;",
    "mucciarelli et al .",
    "in particular , optical observations , either via spectroscopy or broad - band photometry , are key to determine the star classification and physical parameters , such as surface temperature , surface gravity , and chemical composition of the atmosphere .",
    "this information then allow one to determine the age of the binary system ( and that of the msp independently of the measurements on @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) and track the system evolutionary history .",
    "optical observations also allow one to find evidence for irradiation of the companion star through the identification of hot spots on the stellar surface . this can be a further tracer of the ablation process in bw and rb systems , after the more direct one which comes from the observation of eclipses of the radio signal as it propagates through the stellar wind from the irradiated msp companion . for only @xmath3 50 binary msps",
    "the companion star has been identified in the optical .",
    "thus , for only about one third of the msps we know the optical characteristics of the companion star . in most cases , this is mainly due to the relatively large distances of these systems and the interstellar extinction in the galactic plane , which hampers deep multi - band optical observations . for the vast majority of non - eclipsing msps ,",
    "the companion stars are found to be he wds , although more cases of msps with co wd companions have been found in the last few years ( e.g. , mignani et al .",
    "2014 ) . in this manuscript",
    "we report on the search for the companion stars of four unidentified binary msps carried out using archival data from the gemini - south telescope .",
    "we describe the msps sample and the observations in section 2 , while we present and discuss the results in section 3 and 4 , respectively .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for @xmath24 the derived range for the pulsar distance purely imposed by the observed colour and magnitude of the companion star ( blue lines in fig .",
    "[ limiti0614 ] ) , would confirm that the distance to the pulsar is indeed about half the value inferred from the dm and the ne2011 model ( table [ dist ] ) , as suggested by ransom et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . on the contrary , the corresponding range for",
    "@xmath25 would indicate that the pulsar distance can not be much larger than the value obtained from the dm , whereas its high galactic latitude ( @xmath26 ) and the low value of the dm ( 8.09 pc @xmath27 ) might have suggested that such a value is underestimated by a factor of two ( gaensler et al .",
    "2008 ; chatterjee et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "we used the mass and age ranges of the wd companions derived above to select the associated ranges of the star surface temperature @xmath28 , luminosity and surface gravity @xmath29 ( second half of table [ tab : parameters ] ) from the he wd model evolutionary tracks ( panei et al .",
    "as seen , the wd companion star to @xmath25 would stand out for its lower temperature ( @xmath304000 k ) , definitely on the lower end of the wd temperature distribution , and lower luminosity ( @xmath31\\approx -4 $ ] ) with respect to the other msp companions .",
    "the inferred lower temperature was also anticipated by the observed reddish colour of the star ( fig . [ 1231-cmd ] ) .",
    "thus , the wd companion to @xmath25 would be one of the coolest wds known so far .",
    "if confirmed , this result would be exceptional but not unheard of .",
    "we note that a very low temperature wd companion ( @xmath32 k ) has been likely identified also in the msp binary system psr j2222@xmath10137 ( kaplan et al .",
    "2014 ) . on the other hand",
    ", both the wd companion stars to @xmath24 and @xmath33 would be hotter , with temperatures more compatible with the values expected for a wd ( @xmath3410000 k ) , and are more luminous ( @xmath31\\approx -3 $ ] ) .",
    "using the gemini - south telescope , we identified the likely companion stars to three msps ( psr j0614@xmath13329 , j1231@xmath11411 , and j2017 + 0603 ) . for a fourth pulsar ( psr j0613@xmath10200 ) ,",
    "the identification of the companion star was hampered by the presence of a bright star ( g=16@xmath20.03 ) at @xmath35 from the pulsar radio position .",
    "we ruled out with a reasonable confidence that this star is a candidate companion to the pulsar .",
    "the companion stars of the other three msps can be possibly identified as he wds on the basis of multi - band photometry and comparison with simulated stellar models ( panei et al .",
    "2007 ) . for psr j1231@xmath11411",
    "the identification is somewhat more uncertain owing to the more ambiguous match with the evolutionary tracks .",
    "if these identifications were confirmed , they would prove that he wds tend to be the most common companions to non - eclipsing msps , as suggested by the number of msp companions which have been identified in the optical so far . for psr j0614@xmath13329 , j1231@xmath11411 , and j2017 + 0603 ,",
    "we derive possible ranges for the wd mass , age , surface temperature , luminosity , and gravity ( see table [ tab : parameters ] ) within the ranges predicted by the assumed he wd models and optical / radio observations . for none of these three msps",
    "we could look for flux modulations at the orbital period of the binary system , owing to the sparse data points and the uneven time coverage of the orbital period provided by the gemini observations .",
    "future variability studies of the companion star fluxes through optical photometry , together with the measurements of the radial velocity curves through optical spectroscopy with 8m - class telescopes , will firmly prove the proposed associations with the msps , currently based upon a very good positional coincidence with the radio coordinates and the colours of the candidate companions stars .",
    "optical spectroscopy would also be crucial to verify our tentative classification of the msp companion stars as he wds , so far only based upon optical broad - band photometry in three bands , obtain more robust measurements of their stellar parameters , such as the mass , surface temperature and gravity , and provide information on the atmosphere composition .",
