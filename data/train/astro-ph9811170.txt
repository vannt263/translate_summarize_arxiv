    "interstellar dust is composed of heavy elements made and ejected by stars . supernovae ( sne ) govern the dust content in galaxies : observationally , dust has been clearly detected in the sn1987a event ( moseley et al .",
    "1989 ; see also kozasa , hasegawa , & nomoto 1989 ) , and theoretically , dwek & scalo ( 1980 ) demonstrated that sne are the dominant sources for the formation of dust grains .",
    "dwek & scalo ( 1980 ) also showed that the dust is destroyed in sn remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "recently , galaxy - evolution models including the evolution of dust content have been developed ( wang 1991 ; takagi & arimoto 1997 ; lisenfeld & ferrara 1998 , hereafter lf98 ; dwek 1998 , hereafter d98 ) .",
    "the processes of dust formation and destruction by sne are taken into account in lf98 , in order to explain the relation between dust - to - gas mass ratio and metallicity of dwarf irregular galaxies and blue compact dwarf galaxies",
    ". we can find detailed mathematical frameworks to calculate the dust abundance in any galactic system in d98 , in which the accretion of heavy elements onto preexisting dust grains is considered in addition to the processes considered in lf98 .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the dust - to - gas ratio of nearby star - forming galaxies with a simple model .",
    "we use spiral galaxies as the sample of star - forming galaxies .",
    "first of all , in the next section , we apply instantaneous recycling approximation to the model equations in d98 to describe a simplified relation between dust - to - gas ratio and metallicity .",
    "our model is a one - zone model ( i.e. , the spatial distribution of gas , metal , and dust within a galaxy is not taken into account ) .",
    "the result is compared with observational data in the same section . finally , we present summary and conclusion in  3 .",
    "we , here , present the equations which describe the changing rate of the mass of gas , metal and dust in a galaxy . here , we adopt a simple one - zone model , because we are interested in the _ global _ properties of galaxies . for the model treating the radial distribution of gas , element , and dust in a galaxy , see d98 .",
    "after some modifications , equations ( 6)(8 ) of lf98 are written as @xmath0 here , @xmath1 is the mass of gas .",
    "the metal is labeled by @xmath2 ( @xmath3 , c , si , mg , fe , @xmath4 ) , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the total mass of the metal @xmath2 ( in gas and dust phases ) and the mass of the metal @xmath2 in the dust phase , respectively .",
    "the star formation rate is denoted by @xmath7 ; @xmath8 is the total injection rate of mass from stars ; @xmath9 is the mass fraction of the element @xmath2 ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) ; @xmath11 is the total injection rate of element @xmath2 from stars ; @xmath12 is the mass fraction of the element @xmath2 locked up in dust ( i.e. , @xmath13 ) .",
    "the meanings of the other parameters in the above equations are as follows : @xmath14 represents the dust mass fraction in the injected material , in other words , the dust condensation efficiency in the ejecta ; @xmath15 refers to the efficiency of dust destruction during star formation ( @xmath16 corresponds to destruction of only the dust incorporated into the star , and @xmath17 $ ] corresponds to a net destruction [ formation ] in the star formation ) ; @xmath18 is the accretion timescale of the element @xmath2 onto preexisting dust grains in molecular clouds ; @xmath19 is the timescale of dust destruction by sn shocks .",
    "we hereafter assume that only dust incorporated into stars is destroyed when the stars form ; i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "our equations above are different from the equations in lf98 in the following two ways .",
    "the one is that we neglect the outflow term ( i.e. , we set @xmath20 in the equations of lf98 ) , since we expect that outflows of gas from spiral galaxies , in which we are interested , are not effective because their gravitational potentials are much deeper than those of dwarf galaxies , which lf98 treated .",
    "for this reason and for simplicity , we here neglect the outflow terms .",
    "the other is the addition of the third term of the left - hand side in equation ( [ basic3 ] ) .",
    "this term represents the accretion of element @xmath2 onto the preexisting dust grains .",
    "the process is effective in molecular clouds , where the density of gas is high enough for the dust particles to grow through collisions with the atoms of heavy elements .",
    "the timescale @xmath18 is determined from the lifetimes of molecular clouds .",
    "the detailed discussion about the accretion process can be found in  7 of d98 .    here",
    ", we adopt the instantaneous recycling approximation ( tinsley 1980 ) : stars less massive than @xmath21 live forever and the others die instantaneously .",
    "this approximation allows us to write @xmath8 and @xmath11 , respectively , as @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the returned fraction of the mass that has formed stars which is subsequently ejected into the interstellar space , and @xmath25 is the mass fraction of the element @xmath2 newly produced and ejected by stars . and @xmath26 for the notations in lf98 . ] @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be obtained using the following formulae ( maeder 1992 ) : @xmath27 in equation ( [ eqr ] ) , @xmath28 is the initial mass function ( imf ) , and @xmath29 is the upper mass cutoff of stellar mass .",
    "the imf is normalized so that integral of @xmath30 in the full range of stellar mass becomes 1 .",
    "thus , @xmath28 has dimension of the inverse square of mass . in equation ( [ eqy ] )",
    ", @xmath31 is the remnant mass ( @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 ) and @xmath36 is the mass fraction of a star of mass @xmath37 converted into the element @xmath2 and ejected . using the above parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 , equations ( [ basic1])([basic3 ] ) become @xmath38 { \\cal d}_i,\\label{basic6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are , respectively , defined by @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "( see also eqs .",
    "1012 in lf98 . )",
    "we can regard @xmath41 as constant in time (  6.2 of d98 ) .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the destruction rate of dust by snrs is written as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the grain destruction efficiency , @xmath46 is the total mass of interstellar gas swept up by a snr during its lifetime , and @xmath47 is the number of sne ( type i and type ii ) per unit time . since this should be equivalent to the last term of right - hand side of equation ( [ basic3 ] ) , @xmath48 . because the dependence of @xmath49 on the gas density is weak ( jones , tielens , & hollenbach 1996 ) , we regard @xmath49 as a constant .",
    "if we reasonably assume that @xmath47 is proportional to the star formation rate , we derive @xmath50 .",
    "this is why @xmath51 can be treated as a constant .",
    "the galactic value shows @xmath52 ( lf98 ) .",
    "this value corresponds to @xmath53 yr , which is consistent with jones et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and jones , tielens , & hollenbach ( 1996 ) .",
    "the relation @xmath54 ( d98 ) leads to @xmath55 .    combining equations ( [ basic5 ] ) and ( [ basic6 ] )",
    ", we obtain the following differential equation of @xmath56 as a function of @xmath9 : @xmath57 where we used the relation of @xmath58 .      the result of the numerical integration of equation ( [ difeq ] ) is compared with observational data of nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "we take again @xmath3 ( see also  2.1 ) .",
    "moreover , we make an assumption that total mass of dust including both oxygen dust and carbon dust is proportional to that of oxygen in the dust phase . in other words , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is assumed to be constant for all spiral galaxies .",
    "we adopt the galactic value , @xmath61 according to table 2.2 of whittet ( 1992 ) .    for further quantification , we need to fix the values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the traced element ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we choose oxygen as the tracer , because ( i ) most of it is produced in type ii sne which are also responsible for the shock destruction of dust grains ; ( ii ) oxygen is the main constituent of dust grains ( see also lf98 ) .",
    "the point ( i ) means that the instantaneous recycling approximation may be a reasonable approximation for the investigation of oxygen abundances , since the generation of oxygen is a massive - star - weighed phenomenon . in other words , results are insensitive to the value of @xmath21 defined in equations ( [ eqr ] ) and ( [ eqy ] ) . according to lf98 , we put @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we use a power - law form of the imf : @xmath64 .",
    "two kinds of the imfs are investigated : @xmath65 ( salpeter 1955 ) and @xmath66 ( scalo 1986 ) .",
    "if we assume that the lower cutoff of the stellar mass is equal to @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 for the imfs of salpeter and scalo , respectively ( lf98 ) . adopting the lower cutoff of @xmath70 instead ,",
    "the values become @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the salpeter and scalo imfs , respectively .",
    "we use the former values for @xmath24 and @xmath73 .",
    "we treat the latter values only in  2.2.3 .",
    "first , we examine the dependence of @xmath74@xmath75 relation on the parameter @xmath76 , the efficiency of accretion of heavy element onto the preexisting dust grains .",
    "the result is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the data points are from issa , maclaren , & wolfendale ( 1990 ; see also the references therein ) .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio is calculated from the interstellar extinction and column densities of h i and h@xmath77 .",
    "each value is evaluated at a galactocentric distance equivalent to that of the sun ( the galactocentric distance of each galaxy is properly scaled according to its size ) .",
    "we show the cases of @xmath78 and 20 ( the solid , dotted , and dashed lines , respectively ) , with the relation @xmath79 fixed .",
    "the increase of @xmath40 means that accretion of heavy elements onto preexisting dust becomes efficient .",
    "thus , for a fixed value of the metallicity , dust - to - gas ratio increases as @xmath40 increases .",
    "we also show the case of @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( long - dashed line ) , which is far from reproducing the data .",
    "this means that we should take into account the accretion onto the preexisting dust as dwek & scalo ( 1980 ) asserted .",
    "thus , the models in lf98 , which do not include the term of the accretion , can not be applied to spiral galaxies .",
    "the equations in lf98 can be applied to dwarf galaxies , where the accretion process may be inefficient because of their low metallicity .",
    "the accretion process is properly considered in d98 .      in figure 2 ,",
    "the solid , dotted , and dashed lines show the @xmath75@xmath74 relations for @xmath82 , 0.1 , and 0.01 , respectively ( in the case of @xmath83 and the salpeter imf ) . in lf98 , @xmath84 is suggested to be an optimistic upper limit .",
    "figure 2 shows that the larger efficiency of metal production from heavy elements leads to the larger dust - to - gas ratio .    in the limit of @xmath85 , the solution of equation ( [ difeq ] )",
    "reduces to @xmath86 ( see also lf98 ) , so that @xmath75 scales linearly with @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the precise value of @xmath87 can be constrained by low - metal galaxies .",
    "indeed , the difference among the three cases is significant in the low-@xmath74 region in figure 2 .",
    "it seems unlikely that @xmath88 , since the data of the low - metal spirals can not be reproduced by such small @xmath87 .      the difference of mass function",
    "is represented by different @xmath24 and @xmath73 (  2.1 ) .",
    "we examine how the difference affects the result .",
    "we present the result in figure 4 .",
    "the salpeter and scalo imfs are represented by the solid and dotted lines , respectively ( lower ones ) .",
    "as commented above , if we use the lower mass cutoff for the stellar mass , @xmath24 and @xmath73 become smaller .",
    "we also show the case of lower mass cutoff ( @xmath70 ; the upper line for each imf ) .",
    "the differences among the results are too small ( comparable to the typical observational errors ) to determine which line is preferable .",
    "based on the models proposed by lf98 and d98 , we have examined the dust content in nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "we simplified the basic equations in d98 and applied the instantaneous recycling approximation to them .",
    "we treated one - zone model equations which describe the changing rate of dust - to - gas ratio including the terms of dust condensation from heavy elements ejected by stars , destruction by sn shocks , destruction in star - forming regions , and accretion of elements onto preexisting dust grains (  2.1 ) . assuming that the total dust mass is proportional to the mass of oxygen in the dust phase , we compared the results mass conversion factor ; arimoto , sofue , & tsujimoto 1996 ) . ] with the data of nearby spiral galaxies ( for the detailed comparison with the galactic values , see d98 , in which the data are excellently reproduced ) .",
    "finally , we summarize the conclusions reached in this paper :    \\(i ) unless we do not take into account the accretion process of heavy elements onto the preexisting dust particles , we can not explain the observed relations between dust - to - gas ratios and metallicities of nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "the accretion process is important for high - metallicity systems , since the collision rate between heavy - element atoms and dust grains is large .",
    "the data of dwarf galaxies , which are generally low - metallicity systems , may be explained even if the accretion process is neglected ( lf98 ) . the recent model by d98 properly treated the accretion .",
    "we are grateful to s. mineshige for continuous encouragement .",
    "we wish to thank e. dwek for many comments which improved discussions in this paper and our knowledge of recent studies on dust .",
