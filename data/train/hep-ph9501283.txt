    "at least 100 neutrino bursts from the gravitational collapses of stars in our galaxy are already on the way to the earth .",
    "a registration of even one of those by the existing detectors , kamiokande @xcite , baksan @xcite , lsd @xcite , and especially , by the new installations : lvd @xcite ( which is already working ) , sno @xcite and superkamiokande @xcite ( starting to operate in 1996 ) , icarus @xcite ( which is at the prototype stage ) will give unique and extremely rich information about features of the gravitational collapse , supernova phenomena and neutrinos themselves .",
    "already sn1987a has given a lot .",
    "in general , one will be able to get information on the energy spectra ( as a function of time ) of @xmath13 , @xmath7 , as well as of neutrinos of the non - electron type : @xmath14 @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "certain properties of these spectra do not depend on the model of the star thus opening the possibility to study the characteristics of neutrinos .",
    "new experiments are discussed to detect the neutrino bursts from collapses in other nearby galaxies @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a possibility to study effects of the neutrino magnetic moments using the neutrino bursts . in the magnetic fields",
    "the neutrinos with magnetic moments undergo spin - precession @xcite , spin - flavor precession @xcite or / and resonant spin - flavor conversion , e.g. @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "previously , the applications of these effects to neutrinos from supernova have been considered in @xcite ( precession ) and @xcite ( resonance conversion ) .",
    "the spin - flip effects are determined by the product , @xmath8 , of the neutrino magnetic moment , @xmath4 , and the strength of the magnetic field , @xmath19 .",
    "the discovery of the effects corresponding to values of @xmath4 near the present upper bound , @xmath20 @xcite ( @xmath21 is the bohr magneton ) will imply rich physics beyond the standard model . from this point of view the studies of the neutrino bursts",
    "are of special interest since the magnetic fields in supernova can be as strong as @xmath22 gauss .",
    "it is reasonable to address two questions , keeping in mind that the magnetic field profiles of supernovae are essentially unknown , and vary from the star to star .",
    "what are the experimental signatures of the spin - flip effects",
    "? and what could be the sensitivity of the neutrino burst studies to the magnetic moments of neutrinos , or more precisely to @xmath8 ?    the spin - flip probability may be of the order @xmath23 , if @xmath24 where the strength of the magnetic field is integrated along neutrino trajectory .",
    "suggesting the field profile @xmath25 with @xmath26 gauss , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 km , where @xmath29 is the distance from the center of star , one gets from ( 1 ) , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "( for a constant field a similar bound is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the size of region with the magnetic field ) .",
    "these numbers look encouraging , being 3 - 5 orders of magnitude below the present bound .    however , the estimation ( 1 ) corresponds to neutrino propagation in vacuum ( no matter ) , where the precession takes place with maximal depth , @xmath34 . in this case the  optimal conditions \" for the spin - flip are realized : the value of @xmath8 needed to change the spin - flip probability by a given amount @xmath35 is minimal @xcite .",
    "the presence of dense matter strongly reduces a sensitivity to @xmath4 .",
    "forward neutrino scattering ( refraction ) results in neutrino level splitting : @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the difference of the effective potentials acquired by the left and right handed neutrino components in matter .",
    "typically @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the total potential , @xmath40 is the fermi constant , @xmath41 is the nucleon number density , @xmath42 is the matter density and @xmath43 is the nucleon mass .",
    "the level splitting suppresses the depth of precession @xcite : @xmath44^{2}},\\ ] ] and to have @xmath45 , one needs @xmath46 in dense medium the restriction ( 6 ) is much stronger than ( 3 ) .",
    "indeed , for typical density of the neutrinosphere of the supernova : @xmath47 g/@xmath48 and for @xmath49 gauss , one gets from ( 6 ) : @xmath50 . with increase of distance , the potential @xmath37 decreases as @xmath51 , or quicker , and the restriction ( 6 ) relaxes faster than ( 3 ) . at @xmath52",
    "it becomes even weaker than ( 3 ) ( here @xmath53 cm is the solar radius ) .",
    "the suppression of the matter density ( i.e. , approaching the vacuum condition ) results in the increase of the sensitivity to @xmath4 .",
    "this is realized in the case of the resonant spin - flavor conversion @xcite .",
    "if the left and right handed neutrino components connected by the magnetic moment have different masses , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , being also of different flavors , the matter effect can be compensated by mass splitting : @xmath56 ( _ resonance condition _ ) , where @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is the neutrino energy . now",
    "the expression for @xmath59 becomes @xmath60 and in the resonance ( 7 ) one gets @xmath61 .",
    "however , since @xmath37 changes with distance , the equality @xmath62 holds only in the resonance point , @xmath63 .",
    "strong compensation of the matter effects occurs in some layer around @xmath63 whose size depends on gradient of the potential : @xmath64 .",
    "indeed , from ( 8) one finds that @xmath65 , if @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the half - width of the resonance layer .",
    "the spatial size of the region with @xmath68 equals @xmath69 .",
    "then the strong spin - flip effect implies that @xmath70 is larger than half of the precession length ,",
    "@xmath71 : @xmath72 . substituting the expression for @xmath73 in this inequality one gets @xmath74",
    "this is the _ adiabaticity condition _ in the resonance @xcite , and @xmath75 is the resonance adiabaticity parameter .",
    "( note that the adiabaticity parameter @xmath76 used in @xcite is related to that in ( 10 ) as @xmath77 ) . for large densities",
    "the condition ( 10 ) is much less restrictive , than ( 6 ) , allowing for a strong spin - flip effect for smaller values of @xmath8 .",
    "for example , at @xmath78 gauss , @xmath79 g/@xmath80 , and @xmath81 km , one gets @xmath82 , instead of @xmath83 .    here",
    "we will consider _ two new phenomena _ which suppress the matter effect and thus , increase the sensitivity of neutrino burst studies to the neutrino magnetic moment .",
    "the potential @xmath37 can be diminished for special nuclear composition of matter .",
    "we point out that this is realized in the external region of supernova , where the medium is almost isotopically neutral .",
    "another phenomenon is the magnetic field twist  the change of the direction of the magnetic strength lines on the way of neutrinos .",
    "the field twist leads to an additional contribution to the level splitting @xmath84 which can compensate the matter effect .",
    "the experimental signatures of the spin - flavor transitions of supernova neutrinos have been discussed previously in @xcite .",
    "the influence of the spin - flip on the relation between directional ( induced by @xmath85-scattering ) and isotropic ( @xmath86 - interaction ) signals was studied . without consideration of the dynamics of the propagation",
    "it was suggested that the probabilities of different transitions are either one or zero .",
    "the estimated number of events shows that four cases ( 1 ) no transitions , ( 2 ) only flavor transitions , ( 3 ) only spin - flavor transitions , ( 4 ) flavor plus spin - flavor transitions can be disentangled by new installations ( sno , superkamiokande ) . we will consider a more general situation concentrating on the energy dependence of the transitions .",
    "in this paper we study the dynamics of propagation to estimate the values of @xmath8 needed for different effects .",
    "we consider signatures of the spin - flip transitions related to specific density distribution in the isotopically neutral region and to possible presence of the magnetic field twist .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .  2 , we describe the effective potential in supernova . in sect .",
    "3 the level crossing schemes for different values of neutrino masses are found and the dynamics of neutrino propagation is considered . in sect .  4",
    ", we study the dependence of the transition probabilities on the magnetic field profile and on the neutrino parameters .",
    "5 is devoted to the interplay of the spin - flavor and flavor transitions . in sect .",
    "6 we consider some special effects of neutrino propagation and discuss the possible implications of the results .",
    "in particular , we describe the distortion of energy spectra of neutrinos and estimate the sensitivity of the studies of @xmath87-bursts to @xmath8 .",
    "also , the upper bound on ( @xmath8 ) will be obtained from sn1987a data . in sect .",
    "7 , the effects of the magnetic field twist are considered .",
    "for the spin - flavor transitions , e.g. , @xmath88 , the matter effect is described by the potential @xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the number of electrons per nucleon .",
    "the value of @xmath91 depends on the nuclear composition of the matter . in isotopically neutral medium ( # protons = # neutrons ) , one has @xmath92 , and according to ( 11 ) @xmath93 .",
    "consequently , the matter effect is determined by the deviation from the isotopical neutrality .    for the flavor conversion",
    "the potential is proportional to the electron density : @xmath94 evidently , there is no suppression of @xmath95 in the isotopically neutral medium ; @xmath95 is suppressed in the central strongly neutronized region of the star .",
    "the progenitor of the type ii supernova has the  onion \" structure .",
    "below the hydrogen envelope the layers follow which consist mainly of the isotopically neutral nuclei : @xmath96he , @xmath97c , @xmath98o , @xmath99si , @xmath100s .",
    "thus the region between the hydrogen envelope and the core , where elements of iron peak dominate , is almost isotopically neutral .",
    "the deviation from the neutrality is stipulated by small abundances , @xmath101 , of the elements with small excess of neutrons , @xmath102ne , @xmath103na , @xmath104 mg , @xmath105fe @xcite .",
    "it can be written as @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the electric charge and the atomic number of nuclei  @xmath109 \" , correspondingly .",
    "typically , one gets @xmath110 and @xmath111 , and therefore , according to ( 13 ) : @xmath112 .",
    "the value of @xmath113 equals @xmath114 consequently , in the isotopically neutral region the potential @xmath37 is suppressed by more than 3 orders of magnitude with respect to the total potential @xmath115 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "we calculated the potentials using the model of the progenitor with mass @xmath116 ( where @xmath117 is the solar mass ) @xcite .",
    "two remarks are in order . for @xmath118",
    "the spatial distributions of the total density , are very similar ( up to factor 2 ) for stars in a wide range of masses : @xmath119 .",
    "the profiles may differ appreciably in the external low density regions which are unessential for our consideration .",
    "the collapse of the core and the propagation of the shock wave change both the density profile and the nuclear composition of medium .",
    "however , during the neutrino burst ( 0 - 10 seconds after the core bounce ) the shock wave can reach the distance @xmath120 several 1000 km at most",
    ". therefore most part of the isotopically neutral region turns out to be undisturbed and one can use the profile of the progenitor .",
    "strong convection effects in the inner and intermediate parts of the star , if exist , may result in an injection of the elements in the iron peak into outer layers , thus diminishing the degree of the isotopical neutrality .      according to ( 14 ) and fig .",
    "1 , the effective potential @xmath37 has the following features : it is positive and of the order @xmath115 in the h - envelope ; @xmath37 decreases quickly and changes the sign in the border between the hydrogen envelope and the @xmath96he - layer ( @xmath121 ) ; @xmath37 is negative and suppressed by @xmath122 orders of magnitude in comparison with @xmath115 in the isotopically neutral region ; @xmath37 quickly increases in the inner edge of the isotopically neutral region ( @xmath123 ) , and becomes again of the order @xmath115 in the central part of the star . in the isotopically neutral region the jumps of the effective potential @xmath37 ( not @xmath115 ! ) exist which are related to the change of the nuclear composition in the layers of local nuclear ignition . the jump may be as large as an order of magnitude .",
    "the isotopically neutral region spreads from @xmath124 to @xmath125 ( fig .  1 ) . here the potential changes from @xmath126 ev to zero : @xmath127 , when @xmath128 . below @xmath129",
    "ev , however , @xmath130 decreases so quickly that no matter effects are induced .",
    "the detectable energy range of the neutrinos from the gravitational collapse is @xmath131 mev .",
    "consequently , in the isotopically neutral region the resonance condition ( 7 ) is fulfilled for @xmath132 ev@xmath133 .",
    "this covers the range of @xmath134 interesting from the point of view of the solar and the atmospheric neutrino problems . for the cosmologically interesting values , @xmath135 ev@xmath3",
    ", the resonance is at the inner part of the isotopically neutral region , where the potential is still suppressed by factor @xmath136  @xmath137 .",
    "let us stress that the suppression of the effective density takes place for the spin - flavor conversion only , i.e. when both neutrino components are active . in the case of the spin - flip into sterile neutrino @xmath138 ,",
    "the effective potential equals @xmath139 , and in the isotopically neutral region one has @xmath140 .",
    "the potential @xmath141 is suppressed in strongly neutronized central part of star , where @xmath142 @xcite .",
    "we will consider the system of three massive neutrinos with transition magnetic moments and vacuum mixing ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "for definiteness we assume the direct mass hierarchy : @xmath143 and the smallness of flavor mixing .",
    "the energies of the flavor levels ( the diagonal elements of the effective hamiltonian ) , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , can be written as @xmath146 here @xmath147 is the @xmath148-@xmath4-mixing angle in vacuum .",
    "the @xmath16 energy levels , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , can be obtained from @xmath151 , @xmath152 by substituting @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",

    "( this is equivalent to the renormalisation of all wave functions by the same factor which does not change the probabilities ) .",
    "the qualitative dependence of the energy levels @xmath144 on distance @xmath29 for @xmath159 and for different values of @xmath160 is shown in fig .",
    "the resonance ( level crossing ) conditions read as @xmath161 ( @xmath162 ) .",

    "two crossings of the levels which correspond to the spin - flavor conversions @xmath166 and @xmath167 occur practically at the same point , where @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) , i.e. on the border between the h - envelope and @xmath96he - layer .",

    "moreover , for cosmologically interesting values of @xmath181 the @xmath16-resonances are in inner edge of this region . they can also be in the central part of the star .      in the isotopically neutral region",
    "the effective potentials for the flavor conversion and the spin - flavor conversion differ by @xmath122 orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , the flavor and spin - flavor resonances are strongly separated in space , in contrast with the case of usual medium .",
    "consequently , one can consider these crossings independently , reducing the task to two neutrino tasks .",
    "if @xmath147 is small the flavor transition is essentially a local resonance phenomenon .",
    "it takes place at @xmath182 determined from ( 15 ) : @xmath183 .",
    "therefore , the effect depends on the local properties of the density distribution in resonance : @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "the flavor adiabaticity reads @xmath186 ( this corresponds to the situation when at least half of the oscillation length , is obtained in the resonance layer , in the direct analogy with the definition of the adiabaticity parameter for the spin - flip conversion ( 10 ) ) . using the potential @xmath187 ( fig .  1 ) , we find that for neutrinos with @xmath165 mev and @xmath188 and @xmath189 ev@xmath3 , the resonance is situated at @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 , correspondingly , and the condition ( 16 ) is satisfied for @xmath194 , @xmath195 .",

    ", the helicity mixing angle , @xmath196 , which determines the mixing between the left and the right components ( in ultrarelativistic case ) is @xmath197 ( in medium with constant parameters @xmath196 determines the depth of precession , when the initial state has a definite chirality : @xmath198 ) . since in general the field strength depends on distance , the angle @xmath199 can be large enough in a wide spatial region provided @xmath200 .",
    "for large @xmath19 the spin - flip effect may not be localized in the resonance layer , and moreover , the resonance itself may not be local @xcite .",
    "the rapidity of the @xmath196 change on the way of neutrino , @xmath201 , determines the adiabaticity condition for spin - flip : @xmath202 the adiabaticity parameter can be written as @xmath203 here @xmath204 . in resonance , @xmath205 or @xmath206 , the expression ( 18 ) reduces to ( 10 ) . beyond the resonance @xmath207 depends on the magnetic field change .",
    "in the extreme cases one has @xmath208 where @xmath75 is the resonance adiabatic parameter for a given point ( 10 ) . according to ( 19 ) the adiabaticity condition is strongly relaxed , if @xmath209 above the resonance , and if @xmath210 below the resonance . for the density and the field profiles under consideration these inequalities",
    "are fulfilled , so that the adiabaticity is the most crucial in the resonance .",
    "if the initial and final mixings are small : @xmath211 and @xmath212 and the level crossing is local , one can estimate the survival probability using the landau - zener formula : @xmath213 where @xmath214 ( see ( 10 ) ) . at the adiabatic condition , @xmath215",

    "the probability increases quickly with decrease of the field : @xmath217 , when @xmath218 correspondingly ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "an appreciable effect could be for @xmath219 , when the magnetic field is about 3 times smaller than the adiabatic value .",
    "the propagation of neutrinos with magnetic moment in the magnetic field and matter is an interplay of two processes : the precession and the resonance spin conversion .",

    ", i.e. , both processes may be essential ( see sect .  4 ) .",
    "in fact , the condition ( 21 ) is not sufficient for a strong spin - precession effect .",
    "the spatial size of the region where ( 21 ) is fulfilled , @xmath236 , should be large enough , so that the inequality ( 1 ) or @xmath237 is satisfied . for @xmath238 the latter",

    "in further discussion we will give the estimations of the magnetic fields at @xmath239 .",
    "rescaling to other values of @xmath4 is obvious .",
    "the adiabaticity and the precession bounds determined by the density distribution should be compared with the magnetic field profile of star . in fig .",
    "@xmath240 , we depict the profile ( 2 ) with @xmath241 and @xmath242 gauss .",
    "the strength of this field is practically everywhere below both the adiabatic , @xmath243 , and the precession , @xmath244 , bounds ( @xmath239 ) which means that spin - flip effects are rather weak .",
    "the effects of the global field ( 2 ) may be strong , when @xmath245 gauss .",
    "however , for @xmath246 even extremely large central field , @xmath247 gauss , corresponds to very weak magnetic field in the isotopically neutral region .",
    "local mechanisms of the magnetic fields generation due to possible convection and differential rotation may produce the local field being much larger than the global field , as in the case of the sun .",
    "the electron density number @xmath248 , and consequently , the effective potential @xmath37 change quickly in the ignition layers , so that for reasonable values of @xmath8 the adiabaticity is broken .",
    "this feature is reflected by peaks in the adiabaticity bound ( fig .",
    "3 ) . to a good approximation one can consider these changes as sudden jumps of the potential , @xmath249 , at fixed points @xmath250 .",
    "the effect of jump reduces to jump - like change of the helicity mixing angle @xmath196 .",
    "the jumps distort the energy dependence of probabilities .",
    "the position of the energy interval affected by the jump is related via the resonance condition to the values of @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "the character of distortion depends on the magnitude of jump , @xmath253 , as compared with the energy width of the resonance layer @xmath254 ( @xmath255 ) .",
    "( see a similar consideration for the flavor case in @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath256 , the jump leads to the peak of the survival probability with width , @xmath257 , determined by the width of the resonance layer : @xmath258",
    "the height of the peak is given by the ratio : @xmath259 for @xmath260 the jump effect is smoothed : since the size of the resonance region is large , the width of peak is also large , but its height turns out to be suppressed .",
    "if @xmath261 , the height of the peak is of the order @xmath23 , and the width is fixed by the size of jump : @xmath262 for @xmath263 , the jump suppresses the transition in the interval with minimal and maximal energies determined by @xmath252 and @xmath251 .",
    "the most profound effect appears , when without jump the adiabaticity is fulfilled and the transition is practically complete . if the width of the resonance is small ( @xmath264 ) and if @xmath265 , the jump induces a thin peak of the survival probability .",
    "such conditions can be fulfilled in the inner part of the isotopically neutral region .",
    "note that in the considered model of the star there are two big jumps of the potential ( @xmath266 ) at @xmath267 and @xmath268 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "also small jumps ( @xmath269 ) exist .",
    "the elements of the dynamics presented here allow to understand all features of the evolution of the neutrino state .",

    "therefore , the spin - flavor evolution of the neutrino state starts from the inner part of the isotopically neutral region @xmath272 . at @xmath273",
    "the states coincide practically with pure helicity / flavor states . flavor conversion , if efficient , can be taken into account as further independent transformation ( sect .  5 ) .",
    "also the transitions which involve @xmath16 can be considered separately .",
    "we use the profile ( 2 ) with @xmath274 and take different values of @xmath275 . for @xmath276 gauss the magnetic field strength is below the precession bound ( @xmath239 ) in the isotopically neutral region .",
    "consequently , the depth of the precession is suppressed , and the transition has a local resonance character ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "the transition occurs only in the resonance region whose width is determined by @xmath277 .",
    "the efficiency of the transition depends on @xmath75 .",
    "the strongest effect takes place for the energies ( over @xmath163 ) , @xmath278 , which correspond to the weakest violation of the resonance adiabaticity ( @xmath279 is closer to the adiabaticity bound ( fig .  3 , 4 ) ) . with the increase of @xmath275",
    "the @xmath278 range of strong conversion expands ( fig .  5 ) .",

    "for @xmath281 mev / ev@xmath3 initial mixing is still very small : @xmath282 , @xmath283 .",
