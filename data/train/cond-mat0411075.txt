    "recent advances in experimental techniques have made possible the study of fast stochastic processes such as dynamic current switching in resonant tunneling structures .",
    "the electron transport in these devices has attracted a lot of attention since the pioneering work of tsu and esaki .",
    "@xcite the interest was further stimulated by the discovery of the phenomenon of intrinsic bistability  @xcite in double - barrier resonant tunneling structures ( dbrts ) .",
    "other resonant tunneling structures , such as superlattices , are also known to show bistable behavior .",
    "@xcite recent experiments  @xcite established that in the bistable region one of the current states is metastable , and the switching to the stable state was studied . both the mean switching time and its distribution function",
    "were measured .",
    "@xcite    the existence of intrinsic bistability is well understood theoretically .  @xcite it was shown  @xcite that in a certain range of bias , @xmath4 , for every value of @xmath1 the current can take two different values , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ivcurve ] .",
    "if one increases the bias starting from any value below @xmath5 , the current follows the upper branch of the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve shown in fig .  [ fig : ivcurve ] until @xmath1 reaches @xmath3 , where the current switches to the lower branch .",
    "on the other hand , if one decreases the bias from the values greater than @xmath3 , the current follows the lower branch and then switches to the upper branch at @xmath5 .",
    "the bistability can be understood by considering the potential profile of the dbrts schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] . if the level @xmath6 in the quantum well is below the bottom of the conduction band of the left lead , tunneling into the well is not possible , and the current through the heterostructure is zero . in this case",
    "the charge in the well @xmath7 .",
    "however , if a non - zero charge @xmath8 is added to the well , the level @xmath6 rises due to the charging effects and may become higher than the bottom of the conduction band of the left lead .",
    "then , another steady state of current is possible . in this state",
    "the current into the well from the left lead is compensated by the current out of the well through the right barrier .",
    "thus , it is possible to have two different current states at the same bias .",
    "( see , e.g. , points * _ m _ * and * _ s _ * on the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve , fig .",
    "[ fig : ivcurve ] . )",
    "the electric current in the device fluctuates , because the electrons tunnel in and out of the well at random moments in time .",
    "the resulting shot noise of current through the heterostructure gives rise to the metastability of some current states .",
    "the two solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ivcurve ] correspond to the most probable values of current at a given bias .",
    "these two branches are stable , i.e. , any _ small _ fluctuation of current near a solid line will decay with time , and the current will return to its value at the solid line .",
    "the dashed line between @xmath5 and @xmath3 corresponds to the unstable state . here",
    "any deviation from the dashed line which raises or lowers the current will switch the system to the upper or lower stable current state , respectively .",
    "qualitative understanding of the metastability can be achieved by considering the system at a bias near @xmath3 , e.g. , point * _ m _ * on the upper branch of the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve , fig .",
    "[ fig : ivcurve ] .",
    "then , as one can see from fig .  [ fig : ivcurve ] , a relatively small fluctuation can shift the current below the dashed line corresponding to the unstable state .",
    "if that happens , the system switches to the lower branch .",
    "the opposite process is much less probable , since the distance from the lower branch to the dashed line is much larger than that from the upper branch .",
    "therefore , the lower branch is stable , and the system remains in that state .    the dependence of the mean switching time @xmath2 on the bias was addressed theoretically in ref .  .",
    "it was shown that near the threshold voltage @xmath3 the logarithm of @xmath2 behaves as @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the size of the sample , @xmath11 is a characteristic length scale , and @xmath12 is the in - plane conductivity . in small samples , @xmath13 , the current switches from the metastable state to the stable one",
    "simultaneously over the entire area of the device . on the other hand , in large samples , @xmath14 , the switching is initiated in a small critical region of radius @xmath15 .",
    "after the switching has occurred in that region , it extends rapidly to the rest of the sample .    in this paper",
    "we show that if the sample is large , the switching can initiate not only inside , but also at the edge of the device .",
    "the latter process tends to be more efficient , since the exponential in the respective expression for @xmath2 is smaller than in the case of switching far from the edges of the sample ( sec .",
    "[ sec : large ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the switching at the edge can be initiated anywhere along the boundary of the device , and thus the prefactor of the switching rate @xmath16 due to these processes is proportional to the perimeter @xmath17 .",
    "similarly , the prefactor of the rate of switching inside the device is proportional to the area @xmath18 , which makes these processes more efficient in larger samples .",
    "we obtain analytically the full expressions for @xmath2 , including the preexponential factors .",
    "apart from the dependence on sample dimensions , the calculation of the prefactors reveals the non - trivial dependence of the threshold voltage @xmath3 on the degree of disorder of the sample .",
    "formal evaluation of the prefactors in the case of non - uniform electron density in the well results in ultraviolet divergences .",
    "similar divergences appear in quantum field theory , where they are eliminated with the use of a renormalization procedure .",
    "@xcite the application of a similar technique to our problem leads to the renormalization of the threshold voltage which depends strongly on the conductivity of the quantum well ( secs .",
    "[ sec : renormalization ] ,  [ sec : large ] ) . upon this renormalization @xmath19 in large samples acquires logarithmic corrections to its linear voltage dependence .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we obtain the fokker - planck equation for tunneling in dbrts which completely describes the electron transport in small samples .",
    "this equation enables us to find a simple result for the mean switching time in these samples . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we derive the fokker - planck equation for the case of large samples which describes the dynamics of electron density in the well due to both the diffusion in the plane of the well and tunneling between the well and the leads .",
    "we use it to investigate the effect of weak density fluctuations on the decay of metastable current state in small samples ( sec .",

    "the bistable current - voltage characteristic of dbrts was studied theoretically in refs .  .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve shows the dependence of the _ average _ current on voltage applied to the device .",
    "in addition , shot noise was studied in the regime of small fluctuations .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the switching between the branches of the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve is caused by large fluctuations of current . in this section",
    "we use the model of ref .   to derive the fokker - planck equation for tunneling in dbrts , which accounts for these large fluctuations , and",
    "thus describes the switching .    the model is illustrated in fig .  [ fig : structure ] .",
    "the well is extended in @xmath20-@xmath21 plane .",
    "the motion in @xmath22-direction in the well is quantized , and the well is assumed to have only one resonant level of energy @xmath6 .",
    "the two - dimensional wavevectors in the well are denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "the left and right leads are three - dimensional ; the wavevectors of electrons are denoted by @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the conduction bands in the leads are occupied up to the fermi energy @xmath26 . in typical devices",
    "@xmath6 is of the order of @xmath26 ; for definiteness we assume @xmath27 .",
    "the temperature @xmath28 is assumed to be small compared to @xmath26 and @xmath29 .",
    "the well is separated from the leads by two tunneling barriers with the transmission coefficients much smaller than unity .    in ref .",
    "the tunneling through the double barrier was described quantum - mechanically using the breit - wigner formula .",
    "the level widths with respect to the decay to the right and left leads @xmath30 , @xmath31 there were eventually taken to be much smaller than all other relevant energy scales .",
    "we make this assumption from the beginning , and describe the electron transport through the barriers using the sequential tunneling approach .",
    "this method is an alternative to the use of the breit - wigner formula ; it enables us to discuss both the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristic and the large fluctuations of current .",
    "in order to have a steady state of non - zero current in the device , the electrochemical potential in the well should lie between those in the left and right leads , i.e. , @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the fermi energy in the well with @xmath34 being the effective mass .",
    "then , in the limit of low temperature the inequalities  ( [ condj ] ) dictate that the tunneling is possible only in one direction , namely , from left to right , fig .  [",
    "fig : structure ] . the probability to tunnel through a barrier",
    "is given by the fermi golden rule .",
    "the rates of electron tunneling into the well @xmath35 and out of the well @xmath36 take the form : @xmath37 here @xmath38 ; @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the fermi occupation numbers in the left lead and the quantum well , respectively . in eq .",
    "( [ rater ] ) we used the fact that the fermi occupation numbers in the right lead @xmath41 at energies above @xmath42 , because @xmath43 .",

    "note that at @xmath63 the level width  ( [ gammal ] ) vanishes , and thus @xmath64 .    in the sequential tunneling approximation",
    "the average number of electrons in the well can be determined from the condition @xmath65 , @xmath66 one can not directly obtain @xmath67 from eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) , since the potential @xmath68 depends on the number of electrons in the well .",
    "considering the barriers as two capacitors , one finds from electrostatics the following expression for the electric potential of the well ( fig .",

    "one can obtain the current - voltage characteristic of the dbrts by repeating the following steps of ref .  .",
    "first , one notices that the level widths are energy dependent :    @xmath71    where @xmath72 are dimensionless constants . since @xmath30 and @xmath31 depend on @xmath68 , they are also functions of @xmath67 . therefore to find @xmath67 one has to solve the pair of equations  ( [ n ] ) and  ( [ ephi ] ) .",

    "therefore , in the steady state of non - zero current the total number of particles in the well is proportional to the area of the sample .",
    "the linear dimensions of the sample are assumed to be large compared to the bohr radius in the semiconductor .",
    "thus the total number of electrons in the well is large , @xmath76 , and one can expand eq .",
