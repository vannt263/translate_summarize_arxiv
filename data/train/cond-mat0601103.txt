    "experimental evidence of `` hidden '' phases of itinerant electron systems @xcite and the prospect of realizing novel conditions in layered heterostructures and ultra - cold gases have led to increased efforts to identify unconventional phase transitions and predict their manifestations . to give three examples :",

    "there has been a surge of interest in the pomeranchuk instability ( pi ) @xcite . through it a fermi liquid may enter a `` nematic '' state characterized by a deformed fermi surface .",
    "it has been argued that such an instability may take place in quantum hall systems @xcite and in the metamagnets sr@xmath3ru@xmath4o@xmath5 @xcite and uru@xmath4si@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "moreover there is evidence that the hubbard model has a phase with a distorted fermi surface @xcite and the emery model of a cuo@xmath6 plane has been shown to have a nematic ground state in the strong coupling limit @xcite .",
    "more generally the pi is an interesting candidate unconventional phase transition on account of its subtlety .",
    "thus , considerable effort is going into characterizing it theoretically @xcite on the basis of phenomenological models featuring anisotropic effective interactions .",
    "this approach is proving very successful in establishing some generic features of the phase diagram @xcite and describing collective excitations and quantum critical fluctuations @xcite . on the other hand it sidelines the question of how the anisotropy emerges in the first place @xcite and what other @xcite ,",
    "perhaps even subtler instabilities may generically arise in such contexts .",
    "it is these questions that we address here .    in this paper",
    "we present a mean field ( mf ) theory of the pi in a three - dimensional , uniform fermion liquid with a _ central _ effective interaction potential @xmath7 .",
    "the authors of ref .   have pointed out that such interaction may lead to a pi . here",
    "we show that the emergence of the anisotropic state from a galilean invariant fluid requires repulsion with an intermediate range of the order of the inter - particle distance .",
    "this is confirmed by explicit calculation for a model interaction potential for which the theory can be solved analytically .",
    "however we also find that the intermediate - range repulsion leads , quite generally , to a different instability in which there is no symmetry breaking but the topology of the fermi surface changes .",
    "we discuss the nature of this subtler quantum phase transition .",
    "a few instances of the two distinct types of fermi surface shape instabilities that we find are pictured in fig .",

    "we conclude this section by noting that a similar analysis using the screened coulomb interaction @xmath131 does not reveal either pi or instabilities of the fermi surface topology only the stoner instability is realized , and that only if we allow @xmath77 to deviate from its thomas - fermi value .",
    "in summary we have studied , at the mean field level , pi of a uniform fermi liquid with _ central _ fermion - fermion interactions .",
    "we find that pi of different symmetries may emerge from repulsive interactions of _ sufficiently long , but finite _ range @xmath132 ( with the interesting exception of the @xmath0 pi which never takes place ) .",
    "we have confirmed this by solving the theory analytically for an explicit form of the interaction potential featuring repulsion at a particular distance @xmath77 .",
    "surprisingly we have found that , in addition to the pi , there is also a new type of fermi surface instability : the interaction - driven lifshitz transition .",
    "this topological phase transition is even subtler than the pi and seems to be generically associated with the class of models leading to the pi .",
    "further support for this picture is provided by analysis of an additional model , featuring hard - core repulsion . on the other hand",
    "the screened coulomb interaction does not lead to these effects suggesting that a sharp feature ( either a spike of repulsion or a sudden drop ) must be present at the distance @xmath77 .    unlike the lifshitz transition , the new quantum phase transition that we have described is fundamentally driven by interactions .",
