    "<S> the damping rate is then given by @xmath104 and , assuming thermal equilibrium , the associated stochastic force is @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> eddy - current losses can be estimated through a similar procedure . </S>",
    "<S> the energy loss per cycle , @xmath106 , is proportional to the electrical conductivity of the magnet and the frequency of the field . considering the poor conductivity of typical magnets , and in particular of @xmath12b , and the small frequencies involved ( @xmath107 hz ) </S>",
    "<S> , one can readily show that @xmath108 . in the limit of small magnets with a single magnetic domain , the only magnetic dissipative process is related to the alignment of the magnet to a non - parallel external magnetic field , which involves a minimum time scale related to the relaxation of the crystal lattice to the equilibrium orientation ( described by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is predicted to be negligible at the low frequencies considered .        </S>",
    "<S> the previous analysis can now be applied to magnets with sizes spanning over very different scales , from nanometers to millimeters . </S>",
    "<S> small masses provide high force sensitivities since the mechanical susceptibility scales as @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> force noise due to gas collisions ( @xmath110 ) and magnetic losses are minimized for small masses . on the other limit , </S>",
    "<S> large masses provide high sensitivity on the acceleration of the magnet . </S>",
    "<S> larger magnets create stronger magnetic fields leading to bigger couplings to the squids . </S>",
    "<S> however , losses related to magnetic hysteresis become relevant as the volume of magnetic material increases . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.2 ] shows the noise contributions and the final sensitivity for different sizes of the magnet at the reference temperature of 1k for nd@xmath111fe@xmath112b  @xcite , see  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the largest force ( acceleration ) sensitivity at small ( large ) radii is limited by the squid noise ( hysteresis losses ) . </S>",
    "<S> recall that hysteresis losses are overestimated , so one could expect even better acceleration sensitivities . </S>",
    "<S> sensitivities , evaluated at a fraction of the corresponding resonance frequency , reach @xmath113n/@xmath5 at @xmath114hz for a magnet of @xmath62 nm ( with resonance frequency @xmath115hz and @xmath116 ) and @xmath117g/@xmath5 at @xmath118hz for a magnet of @xmath119 mm ( resonance frequency @xmath120hz and @xmath121 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a force sensitivity is more than an order of magnitude better than the current state - of - the art using trapped ions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the acceleration sensitivity is more than three orders of magnitude better than in commercial devices @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> such unprecedented sensitivities could be used , among others , to measure inclinations , vibrations , and magnetic field fluctuations . for magnets of @xmath119 mm , inclinations on the order of @xmath122rad/@xmath5 and vibrations on the order of @xmath123m/@xmath5 could be detected . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic gradients of up to @xmath124t/(m@xmath5 ) at @xmath118hz would also be detectable . </S>",
    "<S> the latter could be used to detect magnetic fields created by fluctuating currents in nearby solids ,  to detect magnetic casimir forces  @xcite . for a magnet with @xmath125 </S>",
    "<S> m close to a silver surface , this force falls within the detectability threshold for separations of up to @xmath126 m from the surface , see  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> electric casimir forces could be detected by coating the magnet with a non - magnetic dielectric material and approach a dielectric surface to it . </S>",
    "<S> further , with appropriate shielding from casimir forces , the device could also be used to test corrections to the gravitational force at short distances  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a more ambitious goal would be to use the extreme acceleration sensitivity of our device to detect gravitational forces between small masses and accurately characterize newtons s constant @xmath127 , see  @xcite and references therein . </S>",
    "<S> note that the gravitational interaction between a magnet of @xmath128 and another sphere of the same mass separated by a gap of @xmath129 could be in principle detected . </S>",
    "<S> finally , using our device as an inertial sensor could have relevant applications in avionics and space industry . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of small variations of gravitation force could also be applied to geological exploration or mining , among others .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented an alternative approach for force and inertial sensing based on diamagnetic levitation of magnets . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the concept is rather general and can be applied to magnets with sizes ranging from nanometers to millimeters , spanning over 6 orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying mechanism behind such an astonishing broad window is the diamagnetic levitation provided by the superconductor in the meissner state . </S>",
    "<S> the use of a magnet with a strong magnetic moment gives rise to a simple passive trapping scheme , and provides direct ways to read and feedback cool its motion . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis , including current technologies and realistic assumptions , indicates very promising sensitivities over a wide range of scales , which we hope will motivate its experimental implementation .    </S>",
