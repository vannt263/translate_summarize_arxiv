    "the flavor , an identity of certain elementary particles , is a feature of the standard model ( sm ) whose real origin still needs more exploration . on the other hand , in the sm",
    ", the recently discovered higgs boson  @xcite is responsible for the masses of all known elementary particles .",
    "this field endows with different masses to quarks and leptons through couplings proportional to such masses ; this peculiarity suggests that the higgs boson is able to distinguish the flavor of each elementary particle .",
    "there are many open questions about the flavor ; for instance , is it possible to find flavor transitions in the lepton sector at high energies , just like those already present in the quark sector ? in this respect , the observation of the neutrino masses and mixing  @xcite marks the first evidence of flavor violation in the lepton sector .",
    "since the absolute conservation of lepton flavor is considered a key aspect of the sm , the neutrino oscillation constitutes a first example of physics beyond the sm .",
    "these considerations motivate the study of lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) among charged leptons . due to the peculiar role played by the higgs boson concerning the flavor identity of particles",
    ", the phenomenon of lepton flavor violation mediated by this field deserves special attention .    in the sm",
    ", lepton flavor - changing neutral currents can be mediated by the photon , the @xmath8 weak gauge boson , and the higgs boson . from these three options , the electromagnetic transitions @xmath3 , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 ,",
    "present the most stringent experimental constraints .",
    "current bounds are given by  @xcite @xmath20 as far as the @xmath8 gauge boson is concerned , the allowed lfv decays are less restricted by the experiment ; the most recent bounds are given by  @xcite @xmath21 on the other hand , very stringent bounds arise also from leptonic three - body decays @xmath9 .",
    "the particle data group reports the following limits : @xmath22    undoubtedly , the recent discovery of the higgs boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) opens up a new era in high - energy higgs physics . in order to establish unambiguously that this scalar resonance corresponds to the higgs boson predicted by the sm ,",
    "many of the coming experiments in lhc will be focused on studying its decays into sm particles .",
    "the properties of this particle will also be under scrutiny at the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite , which is currently at planning stage .",
    "this ambitious program of electron - positron collisions , operating with a center - of - mass energy in the range of @xmath23 gevs , will provide a clean environment to make studies beyond the capabilities of the lhc , expanding our knowledge of the sm by opening access to new physics that could eventually be unfolded through quantum fluctuations of sm observables .",
    "however , it is important to mention that in the case of higgs lfv decays , their observation in the lhc is potentially as high as in the ilc .",
    "the reason is that these channels are relatively clean in this collider , especially the one involving the first two families . besides that",
    ", higgs bosons will be produced more copiously in the lhc than in the ilc .",
    "effects of new heavy particles would show up more clearly in those processes that are forbidden or very suppressed in the sm .",
    "the lfv decays of the higgs boson into pairs of distinct charged leptons , @xmath0 , fall into the former type of cases .",
    "although strictly forbidden in the sm , higgs - mediated decays involving lfv arise naturally in the presence of extended higgs sectors .",
    "this phenomenon has been the subject of important interest in the literature within the context of the two - higgs doublet model  @xcite , supersymmetric theories  @xcite , unparticle models  @xcite , 331 models  @xcite , seesaw models with majorana massive neutrinos  @xcite , and in model - independent way using the effective lagrangian technique  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study the lfv higgs boson @xmath24 decays within the context of the standard model extension ( sme )  @xcite , which is a sm extension that incorporates in a model - independent fashion both @xmath25 and lorentz violation . although motivated from specific scenarios in the context of strings theory  @xcite , general relativity with spontaneous symmetry breaking  @xcite or field theories formulated in a noncommutative spacetime  @xcite , this sme is beyond these specific ideas due to its generality , which is the main advantage of effective field theories .",
    "thus this extension provides us with a powerful tool for investigating @xmath25 nonconservation and lorentz violation in a model - independent way . in the aforementioned sme , terms of the form @xmath26",
    "are included .",
    "each of these terms are required to be invariant under the sm gauge group , the lorentz @xmath27tensors @xmath28 are assumed to be sm field dependent , and covariantly transform under both the particle and observer lorentz transformations ; however , the constants @xmath29 follow a covariant transformation under _ only _ observer lorentz transformations  @xcite , hence the particle lorentz group is broken . in this extended framework",
    ", the action can contain various @xmath25-odd terms , which necessarily implies lorentz violation  @xcite .",
    "although the minimal version of the sme  @xcite is constructed by adding to the sm lagrangian new observer lorentz invariant objects of the form described above , which are renormalizable in the dyson s sense , it can be enlarged to include nonrenormalizable interactions  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we will focus on a yukawa sector extended by both renormalizable and nonrenormalizable lorentz violating interactions , which directly induces the @xmath30 vertex at tree level .",
    "we will show that higgs - mediated lfv is quite suppressed in the context of the renormalizable version of the sme due to experimental constraints , but it can reach significant branching ratios in the context of its nonrenormalizable enlargement .    the rest of the paper has been organized as follows . in section  [ rsme ]",
    "the phenomenon of lfv mediated by the photon , the @xmath8 gauge boson , and the higgs boson is studied in the context of the yukawa sector of the renormalizable version of the sme . in this context , the experimental constraints on the photon - mediated transitions @xmath3 are implemented to predict the lfv decays @xmath0 and @xmath31 .",
    "section  [ nrsme ] is devoted to investigate the possible gauge and lorentz observer invariant yukawa - like operators of the lowest nonrenormalizable dimension that can generate higgs  mediated lfv . in this enlarged version of the sme ,",
    "the experimental constraints on the lfv three - body decays @xmath32 are employed to predict the branching ratios of the @xmath0 and @xmath31 decays . finally , in section  [ c ] the conclusions are presented .",
    "throughout the paper we will be referring to the renormalizable and the nonrenormalizable versions of the sme .",
    "let us clarify these concepts . here",
    "the term renormalizable is used in the usual sense but with some caution .",
    "what we have called renormalizable version of the sme is given by a lagrangian which comprises only interactions of canonical dimension less or equal than four , that is , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the sm lagrangian , while @xmath35 contains @xmath26 , where @xmath28 represents @xmath36-invariant operators of dimension less or equal than four and @xmath29 are constant background fields .",
    "although the divergent structure of this version has been explored at the one - loop level  @xcite , as far as we know its renormalizabilty at all orders has not been proved .",
    "as far as the nonrenormalizable version of the model is concerned , it incorporates all possible interactions consistent with observer lorentz transformations and the standard gauge group .",
    "the corresponding effective lagrangian can be written as follows : @xmath37 where the @xmath38 term is given by a series , in principle infinite , which contains all allowed interactions of dimension higher than four .    in this section ,",
    "we focus on the renormalizable extension to the leptonic yukawa sector that induces lfv mediated by the higgs boson .",
    "the only renormalizable extension of this sector is given by  @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the @xmath41 higgs doublet , whereas @xmath42 and @xmath43 are left  handed and right  handed lepton doublet and singlet of @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the dimensionless matrix @xmath44 is antisymmetric in the lorentz indices but symmetric , although not necessarily hermitian , in the flavor space . in the unitary gauge ,",
    "the above lagrangian can be written as follows : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a vector in the flavor space .",
    "we now perform the change of basis from @xmath47 to the mass - eigenstate basis @xmath48 via the unitary transformation @xmath49 which , as is well known , simultaneously diagonalizes the mass term and the higgs - lepton interactions in the sm , but in this case introduces non - diagonal effects in the lorentz violating extension , @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "although the case of the most general @xmath53 matrix may have interesting implications in some processes , such as the induction of cp violation , for our purposes it is sufficient to assume it real and symmetric .",
    "this assumption considerably simplifies the analysis .",
    "henceforth , @xmath54 leads to a bilinear coupling @xmath55 , with vertex @xmath56 , and contains a lfv coupling of the higgs boson @xmath30 , whose vertex function is given by @xmath57 .",
    "the decay @xmath59 occurs via the feynman diagrams shown in fig.[hdr ] .",

    "@xcite has been used .",
    "in addition , the mass @xmath238 has been disregarded against @xmath239 .",
    "notice the strong similitude between this expression and the one obtained in eq.([tbd ] ) .",
    "in fact , using updated experimental limits on this three - body decay one obtains a bound of @xmath240 , which is one order of magnitude more stringent than the one obtained for the lorentz violating case [ see eq.([b2 ] ) ] .",
    "a direct calculation shows that this updated bound leads to @xmath241 in this lorentz preserving case .",
    "it is possible that the electromagnetic interaction exactly preserves the leptonic flavor , as it is suggested by the current experimental limits on photon - mediated transitions among charged leptons .",
    "however , lepton flavor violation could occur in nature via higgs boson decays ; at the end , this particle has a special role in the generation of the mass spectrum on the sm .",
    "the mass is an important quantum number which is correlated with the flavor of a particle , _ i.e. _ , it is an intrinsic property directly associated with the identity of any elementary particle .",
    "the higgs boson is the only particle in the sm that can distinguish the flavor through the mass because it couples to any massive particle with a coupling proportional to the mass itself .",
    "lepton flavor violation may also be induced by the @xmath8 gauge boson , the current experimental constraints on such decays are more flexible than those existing for the electromagnetic processes .    in this work ,",
    "we have presented the analysis for lepton flavor violation mediated by the higgs boson , the @xmath8 gauge boson , and the photon in the context of an sme viewed as an effective field theory that incorporates non - conserved @xmath25 and lorentz violation in a model - independent manner .",
    "we separately explored the aforementioned processes within renormalizable and nonrenormalizable extensions of the sm yukawa sector . in the renormalizable extension ,",
    "the lepton flavor violation is induced at tree level by the three neutral bosonic particles of the sm ; it was found that the presence of lfv induced in this way is quite suppressed due to severe constraints arising from experimental limits on the electromagnetic transitions @xmath134 . in this context , the higgs decays into channels @xmath242 and @xmath12 have branching ratios of the order of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . about",
    "the @xmath8 boson decays into these channels , the respective branching ratios are of order of @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "these practically unobservable branching ratios are the consequence of the almost prohibited electromagnetic transitions @xmath134 , generated at tree level in this renormalizable extension of the sm .",
    "on the other hand , in the nonrenormalizable extension of the yukawa sector , lepton flavor violation is generated at tree level via both the higgs and the @xmath8 gauge bosons . in this scenario ,",
    "lepton flavor violation mediated by the photon is naturally suppressed as this effect contributes at one - loop level . in this context",
    ", the higgs decays into the channels @xmath245 are proportional to the time component of the vector @xmath2 that characterizes the flavor violating transitions . assuming a time - like @xmath2 vector , simple expressions for the @xmath8 decays into @xmath245 were also derived . under this assumption on @xmath2 ,",
    "the tree - level contribution of a virtual @xmath8 gauge boson to the three - body decay @xmath196 was calculated .",
    "then , the experimental constraints on these decays were used to bound the @xmath2 vector and thus allows us to predict the branching ratios for the higgs and @xmath8 bosons decays into the @xmath242 and @xmath12 channels .",
    "it was found that @xmath246 and @xmath247 , whereas @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",
    "the scales characterizing this class of new physics effects are @xmath250 tev , for transitions between the second and first families , and @xmath251 tev , for transitions from the third to the second family",
    ". it can be seen from these results that , despite of relatively high new physics energy scale relative to the fermi scale , the higgs boson decay @xmath5 becomes compelling , as it can reach a branching ratio of almost @xmath252 and thus be within the range of future measurements .",
