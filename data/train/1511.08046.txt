    "it was shown that the filling factor 5/2 , expected for very high quality 2deg , could be absent in very high mobility samples while occurring in slightly lower mobility ones @xcite . here , screening effects and interplay between different types of disorders play an important role @xcite .",
    "thus , the understanding of isolated scattering mechanisms in these high - mobility samples becomes an important issue .",
    "the main scattering sources in gaas / algaas heterostructures are remote ionized impurities , interface roughness , alloy disorders , phonons and background impurities .",
    "phonon scattering is a material specific property and can not be addressed experimentally .",
    "remote ionized donors are introduced by modulation doping @xcite and provide electrons in the gaas 2d - channel , what makes them unavoidable .",
    "their scattering effect can however be considerably reduced by increasing the thickness of algaas barrier or spacer , an action which results unfortunately in a reduction of the 2d - electron density .",
    "a way to overcome this restriction is to use a double heterostructure or quantum well ( qw ) structure .",
    "for the same spacer width one can double the electron density as compared to a simple heterostructure .",
    "interface roughness and alloy disorders are negligible in high quality gaas / algaas and become an issue at high electron densities and very high mobilities .",

    "the electrons interact with background impurities in the gaas channel as well as with background impurities in the algaas spacer . in this configuration",
    "it is not possible to separate the individual contributions .",
    "most theoretical and experimental studies on the effect of background impurity scattering have been made at very low temperatures where this scattering mechanism is generally the limiting factor to the mobility .",

    "the background impurity scattering is not anymore the dominant scattering mechanism .",
    "the increasing contribution from phonon ( acoustic and polar optical ) scattering with temperature as well as temperature dependent screening effects lead to interesting behavior in the variation of the mobility and electron density with temperature .      for high mobility sample at low temperatures ( in the so - called bloch - grneisen regime @xcite ) ,",
    "the mobility is weakly temperature dependent and is mainly limited by the contribution @xmath46 due to scattering on ionized impurities and interface roughness . in fact a contribution to the mobility depending on acoustic phonons @xmath47 exists , but in this regime @xmath48 is valid . while @xmath49 is temperature independent , @xmath50(t ) has a temperature @xmath51-dependence for piezoelectric interaction and a stronger temperature dependence @xmath52 in the case of deformation potential",
    ". for temperature higher than the bloch - grneisen temperature regime @xmath50(t ) becomes linear and smaller compared to @xmath49 .",
    "up to 40@xmath10k the importance of acoustic phonon scattering is predominant and will be overtaken by electron scattering on polar optical phonons at @xmath53  40@xmath10k .",

    "in the range 4@xmath10k@xmath5440@xmath10k the mobility decreases due to scattering on acoustic phonons .",
    "this is corroborated by the linear dependence of the inverse mobility to the temperature @xmath55  =  @xmath56  +  @xmath57 .",
    "we determine from data @xmath58  =  2.4  x  10@xmath59v  s  @xmath13  k@xmath2 which is usual for acoustic phonon scattering",
    ". the stronger decrease of the mobility for @xmath53  40@xmath10k is related to polar optical phonon scattering .",
    "this mobility drop at high temperatures is common for all considered samples .",
    "however , substantial differences appear in the behavior of @xmath5(t ) for @xmath60  40@xmath10k when comparing the reference sample to the samples with impurities .",
    "the strongest difference is found for the highest impurity density sample e. here the mobility increases with temperature in two steps : first , there is a weak mobility increase up to @xmath61  4@xmath10k , which is followed by a stronger one .",
    "this opposite temperature behavior of samples a and e are linked together , if one considers the behavior in samples with intermediate impurity densities . for sample",
    "b , c and d @xmath5(t ) presents a non - monotonic behaviour .",

    "[ mobility ] , the mobility reaches a minimum and increases thereafter with distinct slopes for samples b , c and d.    we see a clear trend if we consider @xmath5(t ) at @xmath63 . on the one hand , the lower the density of the incorporated impurity in the qws the higher the temperature @xmath62 at which the mobility minimum is seen . on the other hand , the slope of the increasing mobility with temperature is found to be enhanced with the impurity density . both effects point towards the fact that the temperature dependence of the mobility is clearly dominated by a temperature enhanced impurity mobility @xmath64 for @xmath65  40k .",
    "the situation is different at @xmath66 where the decrease of @xmath5 with increasing temperature infers a dominant contribution of acoustic - phonon scattering to the mobility .",
    "in fact the inverse mobility shows clearly a linear temperature dependence @xmath55  =  @xmath56  +  @xmath67 .",
    "intriguingly , we obtained an identical factor @xmath68  =  4.5  x  10@xmath69v  s  @xmath13  k@xmath2 for the samples b , c and d. the value of the slope is higher than that of the reference sample .",
    "one reason might be that the contribution @xmath64 of the ionized background scattering to the mobility has already a positive temperature dependence at low temperatures . as a consequence of this , a variation of the impurity density would result in a change of the behavior of @xmath70 .",
    "this would lead to different values of @xmath68 for samples b , c and d , in contradiction to our findings . here",
    ", it seems more reasonable to assume a temperature dependence of @xmath64 first above @xmath62 , so it is not responsible for the increase in @xmath68 .",
    "as the samples have similar electron densities , the change from @xmath58 to @xmath68 can be related to a change in the deformation potential constant ( which can vary between 7 and 16  ev ) and/or a change in the spatial extension of the electronic wave function @xcite in the gaas qw .",
    "a detailed theoretical calculation is needed to understand this increase as a direct consequence of the incorporation of impurity in the gaas qw .",
    "the contribution of the acoustic phonon scattering to the mobility becomes first negligible when impurities in the qw reach a density @xmath71  1  @xmath17  10@xmath72  @xmath11 .",
    "this can be related to an effective screening of the long range character of ionized impurities within the qw .",
    "further increase in impurity density leads to a reduction of this screening effect .",
    "this is clearly seen in the mobility dependence of sample e ( fig .  [ mobility ] ) where the mobility @xmath5 is already dominated by ionized impurity scattering , even at low temperatures .",
    "the determination of the electron density @xmath6 from the hall coefficient @xmath24 performed at low temperature was also extended at higher temperatures .",
    "[ electron_density ] shows differences in the density @xmath6 with temperature for the samples a , d and e. we observe in all samples a strong increase of the electron density with temperature for @xmath53  50@xmath10k .",
    "this is supposed to be related to temperature induced ionization effects . at low temperatures ( @xmath60  50@xmath10k ) , the reference sample a has a temperature independent electron density as observed quite commonly in high - mobility samples . for samples d and e however , we observe a non - monotonic temperature dependence of the electron density .",
    "with increasing temperature the electron density first increases ( defined as _",
    "region  i _ ) and then decreases ( defined as _ region  ii _ ) .",
    "the slopes for both increase and decrease of the electron density with temperature become sharper with increasing impurity density .",
    "samples b and c ( not shown ) do nt show such a temperature dependence of the electron density .",
    "the incorporated impurities form impurity bands ( ib ) in the band gap . in the case of a gaas",

    "@xcite have shown ( using a model of a delta - doping in the qw which can be generalized to a homogeneous doping as in our case ) that the binding energy is not constant .",

    "the impurity band merges into the conduction band ( cb ) . in the case",
    "@xmath73 the merging of the ib into cb can occur even at lower impurity densities .",
    "so , the problem may be reduced to the occupation probability of the fermi level if , due to the broadening of the impurity band , states are available continuously across the fermi level .",

    "clearly , the maximum is found at the same @xmath75 value of 0.03 .",
    "interestingly , the only remaining difference in the temperature dependence lies only in the magnitude of the density variation with temperature .",
    "thus , the same process obviously leads in both samples to a variation of the electron density with temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath24 ( and thus of @xmath6 ) is directly related to the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the conductivity tensor . due to the presence of impurities , corrections to the drude conductivity",
    "are introduced . at low magnetic fields",
    "the main contributions arise from the electron - electron interaction ( @xmath77 ) and from weak localization ( @xmath78 ) . as mentioned before the weak localization contribution to the conductivity",
    "was neglected by using an adequate magnetic field range .",
    "the @xmath77 correction consists of a diffusion regime for @xmath79 and a ballistic one for @xmath80 .",
    "but in both regimes and in our range of electron densities , the decrease of the electron density with increasing temperature is not predicted by the @xmath77 theory .",
    "so the @xmath77 analysis will be restricted to _",
    "region  i _ and it is suitable to focus first on the diffusion regime .",

    "[ electron_density_normed ] normalized to the maximum electron density at low temperature as function of @xmath75 .",
    "obviously @xmath6 is constant in all samples up to @xmath99 and begins afterwards to decrease with a slope that increases with impurity density in _",
    "region  ii_.    with the assumption of an energy dependent mobility , we performed thermal averaging of the energy around the fermi level .",
    "while this calculation reflects also a decrease of the electron density with temperature , the slope is stronger than the measured temperature dependence .",
    "a reason for this discrepancy might be that the changing screening due to the qw impurity density and to temperature is not correctly taken into account . since the temperature dependence of the electron density in _",
