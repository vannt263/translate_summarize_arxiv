    "solid state systems with massless dirac charge carriers have recently attracted an outstanding degree of attention of theoretical and experimental groups worldwide .",
    "this is mainly due to the impressive experimental progress in two physically related directions of research : graphene @xcite and topological insulators @xcite .",
    "the notion of a topological insulator ( ti ) refers to a bulk insulator with gapless surface states occurring due to topological reasons .",
    "the simplest example of a topological insulator is the 2d electron gas in a strong magnetic field . at the quantum hall plateau",
    ", the gap between landau levels in the bulk is penetrated by a fixed integer number of chiral edge states providing the quantized value of the hall conductance .",
    "the integer quantum hall edge is thus a topologically protected 1d conductor realizing the group @xmath0 .",
    "a novel class of tis @xcite requires strong spin - orbit interaction in the absence of magnetic field ( i.e. it is realized in systems with preserved time - reversal invariance ) .",
    "this type of tis was discovered in hgte / hgcdte structures by the wrzburg group @xcite .",
    "strong spin - orbit interaction in hgte leads to the inverted band gap in this semiconductor . as a result",
    ", the electron and hole bands are crossing near the boundary of the sample giving rise to the two counter - propagating helical edge modes .",
    "the time - reversal symmetry of the system leads to the topological protection of these edge modes .",
    "voltage applied to such a sample results in the appearance of the perpendicular spin current .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the quantum spin - hall effect ( qshe ) .",
    "the robustness of the effect with respect to disorder makes it an extremely promising tool for applications . as a simplest example , the conversion between the usual charge current and spin current occurring in qshe can be used for generation and detection of spin currents .",
    "the existence of a non - localized conducting channel at the edge of an ( appropriately manufactured ) two - dimensional hgte / hgcdte quantum well was experimentally demonstrated in refs . .",
    "these experiments , showing that hgte / hgcdte quantum wells provide a realization of a novel remarkable class of materials@xmath1 topological insulators  opened a new exciting research direction .",
    "a 3d realization of a @xmath1 ti was discovered in the experiment by princeton group @xcite where crystals of bi@xmath2sb@xmath3 were studied ( later other bismuth compounds such as bite and bise were also shown to be 3d topological insulators ) .",
    "the 3d topological insulators exhibit very strong spin - orbit interaction also leading to the band gap inversion .",
    "this results in the appearance of gapless states on the surface of the sample forming a 2d topologically protected metal .",
    "the dynamics of the surface states is governed by the same massless dirac hamiltonian that has previously appeared in graphene .",
    "the main difference between graphene and the surface of a 3d topological insulator is the lack of the spin and valley degeneracy in the latter case .",
    "a combined effect of topology , disorder and interaction on a surface of 3d topological insulators was demonstrated to establish a novel critical 2d state with the low - temperature conductivity of order unity .",
    "@xcite    a similar critical state is expected  @xcite to separate the normal and topological insulator states in a 2d @xmath1 topological insulators . in particular",
    ", such critical state should occur exactly at the qshe transition in hgte / hgcdte quantum wells of critical thickness , when the 2d bulk gap is tuned to zero .",
    "the properties of this topologically protected metal reflect the quasirelativistic dirac nature of carriers , similarly to the interference phenomena in graphene.@xcite    a two - dimensional metallic state in hgte / hgcdte quantum wells can also be realized in the presence of the bulk gap ( either on the ti on the normal insulator side ) by shifting the chemical potential ( with a help of the gate ) away from the gap .",
    "such two - dimensional ti away from the ti regime represents a 2d spin - orbit metal , whose properties ( in particular , interference corrections to the conductivity and low - field magnetoresistance ) may still reflect the dirac - fermion nature of carriers . in recent transport experiments the magnetoresistance of bulk - conducting hgte / hgcdte quantum wells was studied , both for inverted ( thick wells)@xcite and normal ( thin wells)@xcite band structures .",
    "although some aspects of the interference corrections in ti systems away from the ti regime have been already addressed theoretically @xcite there is a clear need in a systematic theory describing the whole variety of experimentally accessible regimes .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop such a theory . analyzing the underlying dirac - type hamiltonian and physically relevant symmetry - breaking terms",
    ", we identify parameter regimes with different symmetries .",
    "the corresponding symmetry - breaking patterns determine the form of quantum interference magnetoresistance , i.e. the weak localization ( wl ) vs weak antilocalization ( wal ) and corresponding prefactors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ s2 ] we analyze symmetry properties of the bernewig - hughes - zhang hamiltonian and various physically relevant symmetry - breaking perturbations .",
    "this allows us to establish emerging patterns of symmetry breaking . in sec",
    "[ s3 ] we use these results to calculate the interference corrections ( weak localization and weak antilocalization magnetoresistance ) in various parts of the parameter space .",
    "section [ s4 ] contains a summary of our results and a brief comparison to available experimental data .",
    "the standard approach to the description of electronic states in semiconductors is based on the @xmath4 method .",
    "this method assumes that exact wave functions in the periodic potential of the crystal are known at some given point in the brillouin zone .",
    "normally , the states with zero quasimomentum ( @xmath5 point ) are used .",
    "then the effective hamiltonian is constructed in the basis of these states by expansion in small momentum @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath7 perturbation theory thus provides the model hamiltonian for the states close to the @xmath5 point in terms of few matrix elements calculated with respect to exact eigenstates at @xmath8 .",
    "the symmetries of the underlying system impose a number of constraints on the structure of the effective theory .",
    "in fact , a general form of the effective 2d hamiltonian can be derived from the symmetry grounds , see ref . , without invoking the microscopic ( tight - binding or kane - model ) hamiltonian .",
    "the only intrinsic symmetry of the 3d hamiltonian is time - reversal ( tr ) : @xmath9 . in the clean case ,",
    "the point symmetry group is @xmath10 ( tetrahedral ) .",
    "spatial inversion interchanges hg and te sublattices of the crystal . neglecting the difference between hg and te",
    ", the point group becomes @xmath11 ( cubic ) .",
    "the approximate inversion symmetry leads to the block - diagonal structure of the bhz hamiltonian .",
    "effective hamiltonian for a narrow symmetric hgte quantum well ( qw ) was derived in ref .   in the framework of the @xmath12 method .",
    "the bernevig - hughes - zhang ( bhz ) hamiltonian has a @xmath13 matrix structure in the spin ( sign of the @xmath14-projection of the total momentum @xmath15 , where the @xmath14-axis is perpendicular to the qw plane ) and e1  h1 space , @xmath16 here we have used the form given in refs . with the following arrangement of components in the spinor : @xmath17 . introducing the pauli matrices @xmath18 for the e1h1 space and @xmath19 for the up  down",
    "( spin ) space ( with @xmath20 and @xmath21 unity matrices ) , the effective hamiltonian can be written as @xmath22    the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 are effective energy and mass . within the @xmath12 expansion in the vicinity of the @xmath5 point , they are @xmath25 the two phases of normal and topological insulator correspond to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the sign of @xmath28 changes at the critical thickness @xmath29 of the qw of about @xmath30 nm . @xcite parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are positive with @xmath34 .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 includes chemical potential and can be varied by changing the electron concentration with the gate voltage .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath36 breaks up into two blocks acting independently in the spin - up and spin - down subspaces with the spectrum @xmath37    the standard way @xcite to introduce disorder in the model is to add the fully diagonal term @xmath38 with a random potential @xmath39 to the effective hamiltonian @xmath36 .",
    "this corresponds to a relatively smooth ( on the scale of the quantum well thickness ) disorder . in particular , this model correctly describes charged impurities located at a certain ( sufficiently large ) distance @xmath40 from the qw , e.g. , in the doping layer . in this situation , within the qw",
    "the impurity potential is almost constant in @xmath14 direction ( across the qw ) , so that it does not break the @xmath41 symmetry of the qw .",
    "alternatively , one can consider , e.g. , placing short - range impurities exactly in the middle of the qw : such impurities would also preserve the @xmath42 symmetry and hence would not give rise to the mixing of the up and down blocks in @xmath36 .",
    "in general , the hamiltonian @xmath43 possesses two symmetries .",
    "apart from the physical time - reversal symmetry @xmath44 , that relates the two spin blocks ( kramers doublets ) , the hamiltonian commutes with @xmath45 .",
    "this allows one to consider the two blocks separately .",
    "an extra symmetry can arise at some specific values of energy .",
    "in particular , @xmath46 acquires its own time - reversal symmetry when the mass @xmath47 is zero .",
    "this happens in the inverted regime ( @xmath48 ) when @xmath49 .",
    "it is also possible to achieve approximate orthogonal symmetry close to the bottom of the band , when @xmath50 , and at very high energies @xmath51 . in the absence of block mixing , this would lead to wl . on the other hand ,",
    "the regions of wl behavior at stronger magnetic fields ( crossing over to wal in weaker fields ) were found in an experiment on similar structures @xcite , indicating that one can indeed achieve the regime of ( approximate ) orthogonal symmetry in this class of devices .",
    "thus we have identified three possible relevant symmetries of the model : physical time - reversal , spin , and block - wise time - reversal ( either `` symplectic '' or `` orthogonal '' ) .",
    "the latter symmetry can occur only in the presence of the spin symmetry , when the hamiltonian breaks into two blocks .",
    "when all three symmetries are present , the two copies of symplectic or orthogonal class are realized leading to double wal ( i.e. , with magnitude twice larger than the usual wal correction ) or double wl correction ( with the same prefactor as in the conventional spinful orthogonal class ) .",
    "if the block - wise time - reversal symmetry is broken while spin symmetry is preserved , we obtain two copies of the unitary class with no interference corrections ( in the lowest one - loop order ) .",
    "if the spin symmetry is also broken , the system realizes a single copy of symplectic class yielding the usual ( not double ) wal correction .",
    "finally , if the physical time - reversal symmetry is broken ( e.g. , by magnetic impurities ) , the single copy of unitary class is realized with no interference corrections ( in the lowest order ) .",
    "let us list possible mechanisms of symmetry breaking in a 2d quantum well of hgte .",
    "_ block - wise time - reversal symmetry _ is not exact from the very beginning .",
    "it is exact for massless dirac fermions but is violated by the presence of @xmath52 . in @xmath53 ,",
    "this symmetry occurs only at one particular electron concentration .",
    "since disorder mixes the states in the energy window of order @xmath54 near fermi surface , it will inevitably break this symmetry .",
    "another , and more relevant , possibility is the detuning of the average electron concentration from the point @xmath49 .    _",
    "spin symmetry _ is broken by one of the following mechanisms :    \\(i ) the block - diagonal structure of @xmath36 is not exact .",
    "off - diagonal elements in the effective hamiltonian arise due to bulk inversion asymmetry ( bia ) of the zinc - blende lattice of hgte and have the form@xcite @xmath55 here the first term with @xmath56 comes from the @xmath57 matrix elements connecting electrons from the @xmath58 band and heavy holes from the @xmath59 band that have opposite spins ( such coupling is absent in a spherically symmetric kane model in a bulk system).@xcite this term leads to the splitting of the spectrum into four branches : @xmath60 the linear - in-@xmath61 terms with @xmath62 and @xmath63 arise after the projection of the bulk cubic dresselhaus terms for electrons and holes , respectively , onto the qw .",
    "typically , the spin - orbit interaction for holes is stronger than for electrons : @xmath64 .",
    "the role of dresselhaus - type terms increases with increasing @xmath65",
    ". these bia mechanisms of breaking @xmath45 symmetry are characterized by the corresponding symmetry breaking rates , @xmath66 within the dyakonov - perel spin relaxation mechanism ( here @xmath67 is the transport scattering time due to disorder ) .",
    "the bia - induced terms are often neglected in the consideration of the quantum spin hall effect in view of small coupling constants",
    ". nevertheless , the break - down of the spin symmetry certainly occurs at sufficiently long scales ( low temperatures ) , leading in the infrared limit to a single copy of a symplectic - class system ( wal without doubling ) .",
    "\\(ii ) another way to break @xmath45 symmetry is provided by the rashba term arising in an asymmetric well ( e.g. , due to a finite gate voltage):@xcite @xmath68 here we keep only the leading ( linear - in-@xmath61 ) rashba term connecting e1 up and e1 down subbands ; other terms involving h1 bands are of higher order in @xmath61 . within the dyakonov - perel mechanism ,",
    "the corresponding symmetry - breaking rate is @xmath69    \\(iii ) the diagonal structure of @xmath36 is broken by atomically sharp impurities or interface roughness .",
    "this type of disorder , combined with the strong spin - orbit coupling in hgte , leads to random non - diagonal terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath45 symmetry can also be broken by finite - range ( smooth on the lattice scale ) impurities located in the quantum well .",
    "such impurities break locally the @xmath41 symmetry of the qw and can be thought of as a kind of random rashba term . near the transition point , the leading ( linear - in-@xmath61 ) contribution comes from the disorder - induced mixing of e1-up and e1-down blocks , similarly to the rashba term .",
    "when disorder is created by distant charged impurities , such mixing is suppressed by an additional factor @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the qw thickness and @xmath40 is the spacer width .      when the dephasing length @xmath72 is longer than one of the dimensions of a sample , the boundary conditions become important for the interference effects .",
    "this is , in particular , the case for universal conductance fluctuations in a coherent sample .",
    "another example is the conductance of narrow stripes of hgte in the regime @xmath73 .",
    "while the width of the quantum well is of the order of few nanometers , its lateral width @xmath74 can be restricted to about hundred nanometers .",
    "in such a restricted quasi-1d geometry , boundary conditions play a crucial role .",
    "let us analyze the symmetries of the bhz hamiltonian with the boundary conditions .",
    "we first assume that the boundary does not violate the spin symmetry and the hamiltonian decomposes into two time reversed blocks @xmath46 and @xmath75 .",
    "then the block - wise time reversal symmetry of @xmath46 will be inevitably broken at the boundary .",
    "the easiest way to see this is to consider the dirac limit of the hamiltonian neglecting the mass in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "schrdinger equation with such a linear - in-@xmath61 hamiltonian is a system of two coupled linear first order differential equations .",
    "boundary condition for such a system should be of the zero order in momentum , i.e. , some linear constraint on the components of the wave function is imposed at the boundary . in a general form ,",
    "we can write @xmath76 with some two component spinor @xmath77 . the elements of @xmath77 may depend on the conserved momentum parallel to the boundary .",
    "the time - reversal symmetry tells us that , if @xmath78 is an eigenstate , then @xmath79 is another eigenstate with the same energy .",
    "if boundary conditions preserve this symmetry then the latter eigenfunction would obey @xmath80 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath81 .",
    "thus we have two linear conditions on @xmath78 instead of one .",
    "these conditions are consistent only if the vectors @xmath77 and @xmath82 are linearly related : @xmath83 with some constant @xmath84 .",
    "multiplying the last expression by @xmath85 from the left , we obtain @xmath86 .",
    "the left - hand side is strictly positive while the right - hand side contains a trace of the product of antisymmetric ( @xmath87 ) and symmetric ( @xmath88 ) matrices and is hence zero .",
    "this apparent controversy proves that any boundary conditions for a single copy of massless dirac hamiltonian will inevitably break its time - reversal invariance .",
    "the simplest way to see this is as follows : in order to produce a `` wall '' for a single dirac - fermion species , one has to open a gap by switching on a big mass near the boundary , which breaks the effective time reversal symmetry already after a single boundary scattering event .",
    "this fact is well known in the context of graphene studies , where in the absence of the intervalley scattering it is impossible to confine dirac quasiparticles without opening the gap at the boundary .",
    "an alternative boundary condition @xmath89 for the bhz hamiltonian is widely used in literature . in order to apply this boundary condition , the quadratic terms in the hamiltonian should be retained .",
    "the relation @xmath89 is invariant under time - reversal transformation .",
    "nevertheless , the time - reversal symmetry is broken at the boundary even in this case .",
    "a detailed proof of the symmetry breaking is relegated to appendix [ app : boundary ] .",
    "we thus conclude that the block - wise symplectic time - reversal symmetry is always broken near the boundary . in particular , in a quasi-1d system the corresponding symmetry - breaking rate",
    "is given by @xmath90 where @xmath74 is the stripe width .",
    "this @xmath91 is just the average time for an electron to diffuse across the system and get aware of the boundary conditions .",
    "when the block - wise time - reversal symmetry is of the orthogonal type ( e.g. , when the fermi energy is located near the bottom of the spectrum ) , the boundary condition @xmath89 does not introduce additional symmetry breaking , in contrast to the `` dirac case '' .",
    "indeed , the system belonging to the conventional orthogonal class can be confined by large potential .",
    "then the `` relativistic corrections '' would interplay with the boundary scattering just in the same way as with the impurity scattering .",
    "so far , we have considered the boundary conditions preserving the spin symmetry .",
    "the spin symmetry may be broken by the edges of a 2d sample if the edges are not ideal in @xmath14-direction .",
    "this situation , which can be modeled by short - range impurities located near the boundaries , seems to be quite likely in a realistic setup . in this case",
    "the only remaining symmetry is the physical ( symplectic ) time - reversal symmetry .",
    "in this section we describe the general symmetry - based formalism for calculating the interference corrections in an infinite 2d sample .",
    "we closely follow the approach  @xcite developed for dirac fermions in a disordered graphene ( see also ref . ) .",
    "quite generally , the existence of a singular ( logarithmic in @xmath92 or @xmath32 ) conductivity correction is related to the presence of a certain time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry that acts on an operator @xmath93 according to @xmath94 where @xmath95 is some unitary operator ( note that the momentum operator changes sign under transposition ) . for",
    "the @xmath96 matrix hamiltonian one can introduce 16 possible tr symmetries @xmath97 that would correspond to 16 soft modes ( cooperons ) .",
    "for example , the hamiltonian @xmath98\\sigma_0s_0 $ ] ( physically , this hamiltonian corresponds to spinful electrons in two valleys of a normal metal , without any spin and valley mixing effects )",
    "is invariant under all these 16 symmetries .",
    "this gives rise to 16 logarithmic corrections to the conductivity of the form @xmath99 the sign factors @xmath100 here are determined by the sign of the time - reversal operator squared @xmath101 . in the present case we have @xmath102 .",
    "in particular , @xmath103 and so on .",
    "one can see that out of 16 tr symmetries only 6 ( namely , @xmath104 ) contribute with the minus sign , yielding for @xmath105 the total conductivity correction @xmath106 this is the wl correction for two independent copies of orthogonal symmetry class .",
    "in general , not all the possible tr symmetries are respected by the dominant term in the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , as a first step in calculating the logarithmic correction one should retain only the tr symmetries of the dominant term , setting all other @xmath107 .",
    "the subleading terms in the hamiltonian may further break the remaining tr symmetries on the scale @xmath108 , introducing gaps in the soft modes and thus cutting off the logarithmic terms by @xmath108 . as a result , in the low-@xmath92 limit",
    ", the singular term @xmath109 remains only for those tr symmetries that are preserved by all terms in the hamiltonian . with increasing @xmath92 , @xmath110 becomes shorter than the symmetry breaking time @xmath108 and the system crosses over to another symmetry class .",
    "let us now return to the case of hgte and employ this machinery to it . in order to directly use the results of ref .",
