    "optical spectroscopy plays an important role , since the aggregation manifests itself in ( often drastic ) changes of the absorption spectra  @xcite .",
    "usually in these studies the considered aggregates are embedded in a solvent at room temperature causing considerable additional broadening of the individual vibronic absorption lines  @xcite .",
    "although such optical investigations already provide useful information e.g.  on dimerisation constants , many details are not available due to the high temperatures and strong interactions of the aggregates with the environment ( solvent ) .    using helium nanodroplet isolation",

    "its semiconducting properties and its ability to form highly structured crystalline films on different substrates  @xcite makes this planar molecule interesting for applications  @xcite , such as organic light emitting diodes  @xcite , thin - film transistors  @xcite or dye - sensitized solar cells  @xcite .",
    "most of the measurements on ptcda concern thin films or crystals : highly ordered films of ptcda have been grown and studied on poly- or single crystalline substrates like mica and gold  @xcite , silver  @xcite , graphene  @xcite , aluminium , titanium , indium and tin  @xcite .",
    "raman spectroscopy of epitaxial films  @xcite , electroabsorption  @xcite , photoluminescence  @xcite and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy ( ups ) measurements on gold , silver and copper substrates  @xcite were also reported .",
    "isolated ptcda molecules have already been studied in different liquid solvents  @xcite , in solid sio@xmath3 matrix  @xcite , on optical nanofibers  @xcite ( sub - monolayer deposition ) and with ups in the gas phase  @xcite . in all these cases",

    "figure  [ fig : monomer_oligo_measured ] shows a comparison of an absorption spectrum of single ptcda molecules isolated in helium droplets ( panel ( b ) ) with the corresponding spectrum taken in an organic solvent ( panel ( a ) ) , demonstrating the huge difference in the resolution of the vibronic transitions .    within the helium droplets several ptcda molecules can aggregate to form oligomers .",

    "in addition to extended experimental data , in this work we are able to reproduce the experimental findings using a simple frenkel exciton model , that contains beside the dipole - dipole interaction between the monomers also the coupling of the electronic excitation to internal vibrations of the monomers . in particular , using this model , we will explain the appearance of the individual peaks of the oligomer spectrum and discuss the origin of their widths .",
    "we emphasize that the aim of this work is not a detailed fit of the measured oligomer spectrum but to gain basic insights into the underlying mechanisms .",
    "therefore we adopt a minimalist model ( for the ptcda monomer as well as for the oligomer ) , being aware that further refinement could be necessary to obtain quantitative agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : experiment ] the experimental setup is presented and details of the measured monomer and oligomer spectra are given . in section",

    "is applied to the calculation of the oligomer spectra .",
    "first the parameters needed to describe the ptcda monomer are introduced .",
    "since we can not perform exact calculations of the oligomer spectra , including all the vibrational modes of ptcda , in reasonable computing time , the concept of effective modes ( em ) is introduced and illustrated . using these ems",
    "we then demonstrate the dependence of the oligomer spectra on the dipole - dipole interaction and also on the number of implemented ems . with",
    "the insight gained from these considerations we then model the measured absorption spectrum . in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we summarize our findings and conclude with an outlook .",
    "the experimental setup is similar to the one presented in an earlier publication  @xcite .",
    "helium droplets are produced by expanding highly pressurized helium gas ( purity @xmath7 , stagnation pressure 40 to 55 bars ) into vacuum through a 10@xmath8 m nozzle kept at a temperature of 17 to 19k by a closed - cycle refrigerator ( sumitomo rdk-408d ) .",
    "for these measurements we choose expansion parameters which lead to helium droplets with mean sizes of about 20000 atoms  @xcite . in a second vacuum chamber ,",

    "shifts of vibrational energies induced by the perturbation of the helium environment have been determined to be less than 0.1%  @xcite .",
    "shifts of electronic band origins of organic molecules embedded in helium droplets have been observed in the range of 10   100 wavenumbers  @xcite .",
    "about 30 cm further downstream , the doped droplet beam is crossed by a pulsed laser beam for electronic excitation .",
    "the emitted laser induced fluorescence ( lif ) light is collected and focused on a photomultiplier placed perpendicularly to both the droplet beam and the laser beam .",
    "a second photomultiplier aside the imaged fluorescence spot monitors the stray light for efficient background suppression .",

    "typically pulses are used of @xmath12ns in widths at a repetition rate of 1khz having a spectral resolution of around 3ghz .",

    "we further introduce the dimensionless huang - rhys factor  @xcite @xmath27 which measures the strength of the coupling of electronic excitation of monomer @xmath18 to vibrational mode @xmath19 of this monomer .",
    "one of our basic assumptions is that the @xmath28 monomers forming the aggregate have fixed positions and orientations w.r.t .",

    "that means that we neglect vibrational motion of the monomers w.r.t .",
    "each other and also conformational changes that could appear upon electronic excitation .",
    "the electronic ground state of the aggregate is taken as the state @xmath29 in which all monomers are in their electronic ground state .",
    "since we consider linear absorption it is sufficient to take only states into account , in which at most one electronic excitation is on the aggregate , i.e.  states @xmath30 in which monomer @xmath18 is electronically excited and all other monomers are in their electronic ground state .    to keep the model plain ,",
    "we assume that in the aggregate the form of the monomeric potential energy surfaces is not changed .",
    "furthermore we will not consider overlap of electronic wavefunctions of different monomers . as the important interaction responsible for the lineshape of the oligomer we take the transition dipole - dipole interaction between the monomers explicitly into account .",
    "in addition we take energy shifts e.g.  due to the changed ( van - der - waals ) interaction between the monomers  @xcite via an overall shift of the calculated spectra into account .",

    "we assume that the oligomers are isotropically oriented and we denote by @xmath8 the magnitude of the transition dipoles of the monomers .",
    "the absorption strength for light with frequency @xmath40 is then calculated from  @xcite @xmath41 with @xmath42 these formulas are valid if all transition dipoles of the monomers are identical , which for simplicity we have used in the following calculations .    details of the numerical calculation can be found in the appendix . at this point",
    "we only want to note that according to  eq .",
    "( [ eq : abs_spek_mit_tkorr_fkt ] ) the spectrum is calculated by a fourier transform of the correlation function @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "practically this propagation is carried out only to a certain finite time , which determines the resolution of the final spectrum . to guarantee that @xmath45 decays to zero until the end of the propagation we multiply it with a gaussian window function of width @xmath46 , which results in a convolution of the stick spectrum with a gaussian of the reciprocal width @xmath47 . for the spectra shown in the following this width",
    "is indicated .",
    "to apply the formalism of section  [ sec : model ] we need to know the frequencies @xmath48 and the huang - rhys factors @xmath49 of the various modes of the ptcda monomer .",

    "( [ eq : abs_spek_mit_tkorr_fkt ] ) rapidly exceeds computer capabilities , even for the dimer , if many modes that couple to the electronic excitation are considered .",
    "for the calculations we therefore group several modes @xmath50 with frequencies @xmath51 that lie in a certain frequency interval together to form an effective mode ( em ) @xmath19 with a new huang - rhys factor @xmath52 which is the sum of the huang - rhys factors @xmath53 of the original modes @xmath50 .",

    "note also that the numerical effort for solving the _ oligomer _ problem not only depends on the number of ems taken into account but also on the values of the huang - rhys factors .",
    "this is because the stronger the coupling of the electronic excitation to a vibrational mode is , the more vibrational states of this mode have to be taken into account in our basis for the numerical calculation of the spectrum . due to the fact that the huang - rhys factors of the ems are",

    "since we have restricted our calculations to dimers and trimers only , the inclusion of larger oligomers ( which amount to roughly 1/4 of the measured oligomer spectrum ) would give additional level density in this energy region .",

    "however , since the experimental data are not oligomer size selected , at the present stage it seems not to be needful to introduce a more sophisticated model risking over - interpreting the experimental data . using hole - burning techniques it might be possible to obtain the individual contributions of dimers , trimers and higher aggregates and also to distinguish between different geometrical arrangements .",
    "then , sum rules  @xcite might be helpful to obtain information on the conformation of the different oligomers species .",
    "nevertheless , the present study already reveals basic effects that will appear in the oligomer spectra . in particular",
    ", it demonstrates that it is important to include as many internal vibrations as possible in the model calculations . on the experimental side ,",
    "vibrationally resolved spectra , as can be obtained by helium isolation spectroscopy , appear to be instrumental as input for modeling and understanding the absorption of such organic complexes .",
    "we express the aggregate hamiltonian using creation and annihilation operators for the vibrational modes . for the nuclear hamiltonians of monomer @xmath18 ( see eq .",

    "( [ hamtotground ] ) is then given by @xmath86 and for the hamiltonian eq .",

    "( [ eq : abs_spek_mit_tkorr_fkt ] ) to obtain the absorption spectrum , we numerically solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath92 with initial state @xmath93 given by eq .",
    "( [ psiinitial ] ) . to this end",
    "we expand the full state @xmath94 in the basis given by the states @xmath95 where the vibrational states @xmath96 are defined by @xmath97 with the states @xmath98 being eigenstates of @xmath99 , i.e.@xmath100 with @xmath101 , and the multi - index @xmath102 contains all @xmath103 for all @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in this basis",
    "the matrix elements of the hamiltonian @xmath104 are given by @xmath105 where we have used the abbreviation @xmath106 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : agg_ham_matr_elem_theta_n_al_basis ] ) one sees that in the chosen basis the hamiltonian becomes very sparse , because of the factor @xmath107 contained in each term .",
    "finally , the time - dependent schrdinger equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdse ] ) in this basis is given by @xmath108    for the numerical calculation we take only certain relevant states of the ( infinite ) basis , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : theta_n_al_basis ] ) , into account .",
    "these states are chosen in the following way .",
    "first we restrict the maximum number each @xmath109 can reach . in the state @xmath110 ,",
    "in which monomer @xmath18 is electronically excited , we take this number to be @xmath111 , so that @xmath112 . in a state @xmath113 with @xmath114 ,",
    "in which monomer @xmath18 is in its electronic ground state , we choose another maximum @xmath115 , i.e.  @xmath116 . furthermore it has appeared to be advantageous to restrict the maximal number of vibrational states ( and therewith the maximal vibrational energy ) taken into account for a certain @xmath19 .",
    "we do this by setting a maximum @xmath117 such that @xmath118 for the @xmath19-th mode . the convergence of the calculated spectra is then tested by increasing one of the values @xmath115 , @xmath111 or @xmath117 at a time .",
    "for example in the calculation of the trimer spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare]c we took @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 for the four used ems given in column  c of table  [ tab : specdens ] ( same values for all three monomers ; the order of these values is the same as that of the respective mode frequencies in table  [ tab : specdens ] ) and @xmath123 for all modes and all monomers . additionally in this calculation we made the restriction @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 for the four modes ."
