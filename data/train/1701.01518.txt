    "as the basic building block of nanoscale electronic circuit , nanoscale capacitor has been the focus of intense study since its fundamental significance . due to the small sample sizes , the finite density of states ( dos ) in nanostrutures can give rise to a non - negligible quantum correction to their physical properties .",
    "for instance , a mesoscopic capacitor shows different dynamic response to an ac external bias from its classical counterpart . at low frequencies , the transport properties of a mesoscopic capacitor",
    "is characterized by the electrochemical capacitance @xmath1 , charge relaxation resistance @xmath2 , and quantum inductance.@xcite numerous research efforts have been devoted in the study of mesoscopic capacitor in the past decade.@xcite    it is known that for a bulk metal , the huge density of states results in a very small screening length while for a mesoscopic conductor , the finite density of states gives rise to a finite screening length . as a result , the electrochemical potential controlled experimentally is not equal to the electrostatic potential that defines the classical capacitance .",
    "this leads to a quantum correction to the classical capacitance that has been confirmed experimentally.@xcite this electrochemical capacitance @xmath1 can be treated in a dynamic way using scattering matrix theory@xcite or non - equilibrium green s function.@xcite at low frequencies , @xmath1 is determined by the serial combination of the geometrical capacitance and the quantum capacitance which is induced by the finite dos .",
    "it was shown that @xmath1 oscillates as a function of the fermi energy.@xcite in addition , the dissipative part of a mesoscopic coherent capacitor is related to the charge relaxation resistance which was predicted to be a universal quantity equal to half the resistance quantum @xmath3 for single conducting channel.@xcite the universal value of charge relaxation resistance is independent of fermi energy even in the presence of strong electron electron interaction.@xcite recently , an experimental study on charge relaxation resistance was carried out on a mesoscopic capacitor made of a two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) quantum dot with the second metallic plate on top of it.@xcite this setup is equivalent to a rc circuit consisting of classical capacitance , quantum capacitance and the charge relaxation resistance . by measuring the frequency dependent conductance of this rc circuit in ghz regime ,",
    "the charge relaxation resistance was obtained and found to be half of the resistance quantum in the single conducting mode .",
    "@xcite at higher frequency , quantum inductance becomes relevant and the effective capacitance of the mesoscopic capacitor can be negative,@xcite which has been seen experimentally in gated carbon nanotubes.@xcite    in mesoscopic systems , the sample - to - sample fluctuation of physical quantities such as conductance exhibits universal behavior in the diffusive regime .",
    "this universal conductance fluctuation ( ucf ) is one of the hallmarks of mesoscopic physics .",
    "it was known that value of ucf depends only on the symmetry and dimensionality of the systems . in the language of random matrix theory ,",
    "the symmetry is characterized by symmetry index @xmath0 where @xmath0=1,2,4 corresponds to orthogonal , unitary , and symplectic ensembles .",
    "not only the conductance fluctuation has universal values in the diffusive regime , the conductance distribution also exhibits universal features in the localized regime.@xcite ac transport properties of mesoscopic systems also show sample to sample fluctuations in disordered mesoscopic systems .",
    "study on the ac admittance of a chaotic quantum dot using random matrix theory ( rmt ) revealed that the admittance is governed by two time scales.@xcite the emittance fluctuation of mesoscopic conductors were investigated including 1d , 2d , and quantum dot systems .",
    "it was found that due to the existence of the necklace states , the average emittance is negative from ballistic regime all the way to the localized regime showing inductive - like behavior.@xcite using rmt,@xcite the distribution functions of the electrochemical capacitance for a chaotic quantum dot system with single conducting channel were derived for three symmetry classes @xmath0=1,2,4.@xcite to best of our knowledge , there is no theoretical study of electrochemical capacitance in disordered systems when the number of conducting channels is large .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to conduct such an investigation . in particular , we are interested in the distribution function of @xmath1 since there are theoretical results@xcite to compare with . also , inspired by the universal conductance fluctuation@xcite in diffusive regime of disordered systems , we are interested in exploring the fluctuation behavior of electrochemical capacitance in different symmetry classes .    in this paper , we perform an extensive numerical investigation on the statistical properties of a mesoscopic capacitor shown schematically in fig.[fig01 ] . in the numerical calculation ,",
    "the tight - binding model is used with anderson - type disorder to realize different random configurations .",
    "we study electrochemical capacitance fluctuation and its distribution function for three ensembles with @xmath0=1,2,4 .",
    "for the case of single conducting channel , it is found that the capacitance distribution shows symmetric gaussian shape in the weak disorder regime and changes to a one - sided form centered in large capacitance region as the disorder is increased . at strong disorders ,",
    "the distribution spreads out in the whole range of capacitance and eventually peaks in small capacitance area with a long tail that corresponds to the large density of states .",
    "this long tail can not be accounted for within random - matrix theory.@xcite it is due to the existence of necklace states in disordered systems which are characterized by multi - resonance with large density of states.@xcite as a result , the fluctuation of electrochemical capacitance is greatly enhanced at single conducting channel case , which is much larger than the theoretical value predicted by rmt.@xcite as the number of conducting channels @xmath4 increases , the necklace states become less prominent and the fluctuation of electrochemical capacitance develops a plateau structure at large disorder strength . the electrochemical capacitance fluctuation at large @xmath4 is found to be an universal value , which is independent of the disorder strength , fermi energy , geometric capacitance and system size .",
    "remarkably , this universal capacitance fluctuation is the same for all three ensembles .",
    "this super - universal behavior is very different from ucf , whose value depends on the symmetry index .",
    "the distribution function of electrochemical capacitance also exhibits universal features .",
    "we find that at large @xmath4 the capacitance distribution is a universal function that depends only on the average capacitance and does not depend on the symmetry of the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec2 ] , the theoretical formalism and its numerical implementation are presented . in sec.[sec3 ] , we show the numerical results on the distribution and fluctuation of electrochemical capacitance for various disorder strengths , fermi energies , geometric capacitances and three different ensembles , accompanied with discussion and analysis . finally , the conclusion is drawn in sec.[sec4 ] .",

    "we see from fig.[fig02]a that , at very weak disorder @xmath59 @xmath60 is approximately a gaussian distribution with the peak located at @xmath61 , indicating that the system is in the ballistic regime . as increasing the disorder strength , the distribution shifts towards small capacitance . at @xmath62",
    "we see the occurrence of small capacitances due to the quantum correction of dos and @xmath60 changes gradually from gaussian to one - sided distribution shown in panel b. a theoretical result from eq.([eq03 ] ) with @xmath63 shows a similar behavior . for a larger disorder strength @xmath64 ( panel c ) , @xmath45 distributes almost uniformly in the whole range except that there is a counter - intuitive narrow peak for @xmath45 close to one .",

    "fig.[fig02]e we see that this tail has approximately a constant distribution in range @xmath69 $ ] which clearly deviates from eq.[eq03 ] . in fig.[fig02]f",
    "we draw the distribution of the logarithmic of @xmath45 at this disorder , where an abnormal peak near @xmath70 appears@xcite .    from fig.2 , we notice two interesting phenomena that disagrees with the theoretical prediction .",
    "one is the counter - intuitive narrow peak around @xmath45=1 at @xmath64 , which means that some disorder configurations have very large dos making quantum capacitance very small .",
    "the other is the unexpected long tail in the strong localized regime with a nearly constant distribution probability at large @xmath45 , where @xmath60 is theoretically expected to decay .",
    "we attribute these counter - intuitive results to the existence of azbel resonance states or necklace states,@xcite which exist in strongly disordered systems as a result of multi - resonance processes .",
    "these states are rare events and form a small portion of the whole ensemble.@xcite although rare , these states can have significant contribution to the ac transport properties of disordered systems .",
    "due to the nature of resonant process , the necklace states ( or precursor of necklace state in the diffusive regime ) give rise to large dos .",
    "we note that the existence of necklace states was confirmed experimentally in a quasi-1d optical system.@xcite in ref .",
    "[ ] , it was numerically found that the necklace states widely exist in disordered 2d and qd systems for all symmetry classes @xmath0=1,2,4 and leads to the universal power - law behavior of the distribution of wigner delay time @xmath71 at large @xmath71 : @xmath72 . here in the distribution of electrochemical capacitance for a disordered mesoscopic capacitor ,",
    "we find again the evidence of necklace states . because of the huge dos from the necklace states the distribution of @xmath73 in fig.[fig02]c shows an unexpected large sharp peak in large @xmath45 region and exhibits a long tail distributed in a wide range of @xmath45 with nearly constant probability ( for @xmath74 ) .",
    "it is very different from the theoretical predictions obtained from random - matrix theory@xcite where the necklace states are not considered .",
    "the peak in fig.[fig02]f near @xmath75 at @xmath67 is also originated from necklace states .",
    "we wish to point out that necklace states manifest only for transport properties that are sensitive to dos .",
    "for instance , emittance and electrochemical capacitance are significantly affected by necklace states . for conductance , however , necklace states have no effect.@xcite     at orthogonal symmetry with @xmath76 and @xmath77 . panel ( b ) shows the distribution function of a system with magnetic field ( @xmath17 ) at single channel and disorder strength @xmath78 .",

    "panel ( b ) is almost the same as fig.[fig02]c and panel ( c ) is very similar to fig.[fig02]f . ]",
    "since the necklace states are due to the multi - resonance process , their influence on the distribution of electrochemical capacitance is notable at @xmath57 . when there are @xmath4 propagating channels in the system , the longitudinal velocity of different channels are different for a given energy .",
    "as a result , the effect of necklace states is suppressed because only one channel can be on or close to resonance and has large dos while the dos of other channels are small .",
    "hence , comparing with the single channel situation , the number of necklace states is expected to decrease by a factor of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore we expect that the influence of necklace states on the distribution of capacitance @xmath45 becomes much weaker for large @xmath4 . to support this argument , we provide numerical evidence on the effect of necklace states in fig.[fig03 ] . in fig.[fig03]a",
    "we calculate the distribution of @xmath81 for a larger fermi energy with conducting channel @xmath76 at disorder strength @xmath77 . comparing with fig.[fig02]f which corresponds to @xmath57 and @xmath67",
    ", it is found that the peak at large dos near @xmath82 disappears .",
    "the fact that @xmath83 does nt decay to zero at this point shows that there are still necklace states at large number of conducting channels .",

    "@xmath84 give very similar results , i.e. , the distributions of electrochemical capacitance in unitary and symplectic ensembles follow similar trend as in orthogonal ensemble shown in fig.[fig02 ] .",
    "the necklace states are important for the case of single conducting channel ( @xmath57 ) and are less important when @xmath4 becomes large .",

    "remarkably @xmath87 for three ensembles are on top of each other showing super - universal behavior ( see fig.[fig03]d ) .",
    "we note that for conductance fluctuation in the diffusive regime , the universal conductance fluctuation ( ucf ) which is obtained as the second moment of its distribution function depends only on the symmetry of the system as well as the dimensionality.@xcite our results on capacitance distribution function suggest that the distribution function and hence the capacitance fluctuation at @xmath77 is independent of symmetry index @xmath0 at large @xmath4 . in the next subsection , we will demonstrate that the electrochemical capacitance distribution function at large @xmath4 depends only on the average electrochemical capacitance and does not depend on the symmetry index .",
    "we briefly summarize the results on the distribution of dimensionless capacitance @xmath45 . in the case of a single transmission channel or a few conducting channels",

    "the distribution function becomes one - sided again but sharply peaked at small @xmath45 , with long tail of nearly constant magnitude in large @xmath45 .",
    "both the peak and tail in the capacitance distributions arise from the existence of necklace states in disordered systems , which give rise to large dos . when the number of conducting channels is large , the peak and tail due to necklace states are suppressed .",
    "the distribution functions for three different ensembles collapse into a single curve at large number of conducting channels and strong disorder strengths .",
    "it is well known that the conductance fluctuation in the diffusive mesoscopic system assumes an universal value@xcite that is independent of fermi energy , disorder strength , and sample size .",
    "similar universal behavior for the spin - hall conductance fluctuation@xcite was also reported in disordered mesoscopic systems .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether the fluctuation of electrochemical capacitance exhibits universal features in the presence of disorders .    in fig.[fig04",

    "since the necklace states enhance the capacitance fluctuation and the probability of occurrence of necklace states is suppressed by increasing the number of conducting channel @xmath4 , we expect that the fluctuation of @xmath45 at large @xmath4 should be smaller than the case of @xmath57 .",

    "we plot @xmath90 versus @xmath105 . here",
    "again we see three curves falling into a single one and the maximum capacitance fluctuation close to 0.20 .",
    "this phenomenon further confirms the conclusion drown from fig.[fig06]b , the geometric capacitance has no influence on the distribution of @xmath45 .",
    "fig.[fig06]c and fig.[fig06]d also show that the distribution of electrochemical capacitance and its fluctuation plateau are not affected by the system size .",
    "the behaviors in fig.[fig06]b and fig.[fig06]d are very similar to the distribution of conductance in the presence of disorders , where different curves of conductance fluctuation versus average conductance at different energies collapse into a single curve.@xcite in ref .",
    "it was found that the universal behavior of conductance fluctuation versus average conductance reflects the universality of conductance distribution : the conductance distribution depends only on the average conductance .",
    "hence our results suggest that the electrochemical capacitance distribution has the following form : @xmath112 , i.e. , the capacitance distribution depends only on the average capacitance .",
    "this result is consistent with eq.([eq03 ] ) , which says that capacitance distribution for @xmath57 depends only on @xmath0 and @xmath56 and so is @xmath113 . eliminating @xmath56 from eq.([eq03 ] ) and @xmath105 , we find the distribution function as @xmath114 .     and @xmath105 vs disorder strength w for different ensembles @xmath0 = 1 , 2 , and 4 at @xmath76 .",
    "panel ( b ) gives the @xmath93 versus @xmath105 curves at channel number @xmath76 showing universal behavior for all symmetry classes . ]",
    "so far , our numerical results show that for the orthogonal ensemble there exists a universal capacitance fluctuation for the electrochemical capacitance in disordered systems , which is independent of disorder strength , fermi energy , geometric capacitance and system size .",
    "this conclusion can be generalized to other symmetry classes . in the previous subsection sec.[sec31 ]",
    "we already see that the distribution of @xmath45 in all the three ensembles are exactly the same for large @xmath4 and @xmath27 .",
    "since the fluctuation @xmath90 is directly calculated from the distribution function , one expects that the fluctuation of electrochemical capacitance for orthogonal , unitary and symplectic ensembles should be the same . in fig.[fig07 ] we provide the numerical evidence to support this point . in fig.[fig07]a , the average electrochemical capacitance and its fluctuation as a function of disorder strength @xmath27 for @xmath0 = 1 , 2 , and 4 are numerically calculated with channel number @xmath76 and other system parameters",
    "are kept the same as in sec.[sec32 ] . from this figure",
    ", we see that three curves are almost identical at large @xmath27 which is consistent with the observation in sec.[sec31 ] and they all develop a plateau behavior with @xmath98 . for small @xmath27 between @xmath115 ,",
    "we do see some difference in three curves . when eliminating @xmath27 from @xmath90 and @xmath105 , we obtain a perfect single curve in fig.[fig07]b for all three ensembles .",
    "based on the above analysis , we can conclude that the electrochemical capacitance fluctuation exhibits a universal value @xmath101 at large @xmath4 for orthogonal , unitary and symplectic classes .",
    "in conclusion , we perform large scale numerical calculation to investigate the statistical properties of electrochemical capacitance in a disordered mesoscopic capacitor for three different symmetry ensembles .",
    "it is found that in the strongly disordered regime , the existence of necklace states greatly influence the statistical behavior of electrochemical capacitance for the case of single conducting channel .",
    "due to the necklace states , the capacitance distribution exhibits a sharply one - sided shape with a nearly - constant tail in large capacitance region at strong disorder , which deviates from theoretical prediction by the random - matrix theory .",
    "when the number of conducting channels @xmath4 is increased , the effect of necklace states gradually diminishes",
    ". at large @xmath4 , it is found that in strongly disordered regime the electrochemical capacitance shows universal fluctuation with the magnitude around 0.20 , which is independent of the disorder strength , fermi energy , geometrical capacitance and system size .",
    "more importantly , the universal capacitance fluctuation is the same for all three symmetry classes .",
    "finally , the distribution of electrochemical capacitance at large @xmath4 is found to be a super - universal function that depends only on the average capacitance and does not depend on the symmetry index @xmath0 .",
