    "quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) occur when the ground state of a many - body system at absolute zero temperature undergoes a qualitative change by variation of a coupling and/or an external parameter @xcite .",

    "quantum phase transition in spin systems have been widely characterized considering the pairwise entanglement between two spin sites @xcite .",
    "the concurrence which is a good measure of entanglement @xcite is maximal close to the critical points and its derivatives can signal more precisely the presence of a quantum phase transition at the critical points @xcite .    in another register ollivier and zurek introduced the _ quantum discord _ as a measure of quantum correlations between two separated sub - systems of a many - body quantum system @xcite . in information theory the _ mutual information _ is defined as the measure of correlation between two random variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 . for classical system the mutual information can be expressed in terms of two equivalent expressions @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( explicit definitions of each expressions of the mutual information are provided later in the text ) .",
    "however for quantum systems the two expressions are not equal and their difference gives the quantum discord . in parallel to the concurrence , quantum discord measures the quantum correlations of a quantum system . in contrary to the concurrence , the quantum discord can be different to zero even if a quantum systems is separable .",
    "the werner state , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a parameter and @xmath7 , provide an example for which the concurrence is equal to zero ( separable state ) for @xmath8 while the quantum discord is different to zero @xcite .",
    "hence quantum discord shows the existence of quantum correlations where concurrence shows that the system is separable .",
    "we point that the concurrence measures the _ nonlocal _ _ quantumness _ of correlations while quantum discord measures the total _ amount _ of quantum correlations of a state @xmath9 .",
    "quantum discord is used in several context @xcite for its property to discernate quantum and classical correlations of a quantum systems .",
    "the behaviour of the quantum as well as the classical correlations close to the critical points of qpts can be studied .",
    "we focus our attention here on the quantum phase transitions of the one - dimensional ising model which derives from the xy model and on the antiferromagnetic xxz chain . using the quantum discord",
    "we show that the _ amount _ of quantum correlations increases in the region close to the critical points . in",
    "opposite the _ amount _ of classical correlations close to the critical points decreases in the xxz model while it is simply monotonous in the ising model .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following .",
    "in section [ section2 ] we recall the elements of information theory which leads to the construction of quantum discord as demonstrated by ollivier and zurek @xcite . in section [ section3 ] and [ section4 ]",
    "the quantum correlations close to the quantum phase transition of the ising and xxz models are studied .",
    "appendix [ appendixa ] provides the derivation of the quantum discord for spin @xmath0 chains .",
    "information on the correlations between two random variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be obtained by measure of the _ mutual information_. in classical information theory the mutual information reads    @xmath10    where the information entropy @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the probability that @xmath13 is the realisation of the random variable @xmath1 .",

    "however for quantum systems the two expressions of the mutual information are in general not equivalent and leads to define the _ quantum discord _ @xmath21 as demonstrated in refs .",
    "quantum discord is the difference between the two classicaly equivalent expressions of the mutual information .",
    "the mutual information expressions and for quantum systems are obtained by replacing the shannon entropy by the von neumann entropy .",
    "the von neumann entropy for the joint state reads @xmath22 where the trace runs over the hilbert spaces of the sub - systems @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath23 is the density matrix of the quantum system . in a similar way",
