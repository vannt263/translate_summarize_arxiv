    "until recently , models used to describe the elastic response of bodies belonged to either the class of cauchy elastic bodies or green elastic bodies .",
    "recently , rajagopal @xcite introduced a much larger class of elastic bodies that included cauchy elastic bodies and green elastic bodies as a subset , if by elastic response one refers to a response wherein the body is incapable of dissipating energy , that is , inability to convert working into thermal energy .",
    "of particular reference to the current work are bodies defined by implicit constitutive relations between the stress and the deformation gradient , or the sub - class wherein the strain in the body is a function of the stress .",
    "such models are relevant when one has a material wherein the body exhibits a limiting strain or when the response between the strain and stress becomes non - linear even for very small strains wherein the classical models of elasticity reduce to the classical linearized elastic model .",
    "when the elastic body exhibits limiting strain then one could encounter the possibility that the stress can not be expressed as a function of the strain ( see rajagopal @xcite ) .",
    "a detailed mathematical treatment of such a response can be found in bulicek et al . @xcite . with regard to the possibility of a non - linear relationship between the strain and the stress , even when",
    "the strains are very small , one needs but look at the response of alloys such as gum metal ( see saito et al .",
    "@xcite ) and many other titanium nickel based alloys ( see talling et al .",
    "@xcite , withey @xcite , zhang @xcite ) .",
    "the response of such alloys can not be described by the classical linearized elastic response but can be described very well with the help of the new class of elastic models wherein the linearized strain is a non - linear function of the stress ( see rajagopal @xcite ) .",
    "another very important class of problems where the new class of models might prove to be very useful is in predicting the state of strain in the neighborhood of cracks and the tips of notches , etc .",
    "while the linearized theory of elasticity predicts strains that blow up in the neighborhood of the tip of a crack , contradicting the very precepts under which the approximation is derived , the new class predicts results that are physically meaningful in that the strains are bounded and never exceed the limit of small strain that is supposed ( see rajagopal and walton @xcite , kulvait , et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "nonlinear waves in elastic bars , within the traditional framework that the stress is a function of the strain , have been studied in various contexts .",
    "for example , recently huang , dai , chen and kong @xcite showed that for certain nonlinearly elastic materials , it is possible to generate a phenomenon in which a tensile wave can catch the first transmitted compressive wave ( so the former can be undermined ) in an initially stress - free two - material bar .",
    "depending on the interval of the initial impact , the wave catching - up phenomena can happen in two wave patterns .",
    "some asymptotic solutions were also constructed . as a continuation of this work , huang , dai and",
    "kong @xcite investigated the wave catching - up phenomenon in a nonlinearly elastic prestressed two - material bar and the global structure stability of nonlinear waves was also proved by the method of characteristics and the theory of typical boundary problems .",
    "an interesting study on impact - induced phase transformation in a shape memory alloy rod was carried out by chen and lagoudas @xcite , and notably they also found that composite waves with a rarefaction wave and a shock wave can arise .    in this paper , we study the riemann problem for a specific sub - class of the new class of elastic bodies proposed by rajagopal and focus on the various wave patterns .",
    "these equations do not possess convexity though they are strictly hyperbolic . in this study ,",
    "the reimann problem for this special sub - class is solved completely .",
    "we find that , depending on the initial condition , a variety of wave patterns can arise including a composite wave comprising of a rarefaction wave and a shock wave . we also note that due to the implicit constitutive relation ( [ 16 ] ) , it is natural to select the velocity and the stress as the unknowns . within such a framework , the equations of motion governing the sub - class of bodies under consideration can not be written in terms of the type of conservation laws that hold for the classical elastic body .    to introduce the kind of constitutive relation adopted in this paper , we first recall some basic definitions in kinematics . the reference configuration , denoted by @xmath0 , is assumed to be stress - free . a particle @xmath1 occupies the position @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the configuration at time @xmath4 , that is referred to as the current configuration",
    "the mapping that maps the reference configuration to the current configuration is assumed to be one to one , and is given by @xmath5 .",
    "we denote the displacement by @xmath6 .",
    "then the gradients of displacement are given as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the deformation gradient tensor , and @xmath9 is the identity tensor .",
    "the green - saint venant strain @xmath10 is given by @xmath11    when one assumes that the displacement gradient is small so that the last term that appears in the right hand side of ( [ 8 ] ) can be ignored in comparison to the other terms , one obtains the linearized measure of strain .",
    "the constitutive relation for elastic response within the classical theory of cauchy or green elasticity then leads to the popular approximation of linearized elasticity . recently , rajagopal @xcite ( see also rajagopal @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) introduced the following implicit constitutive relation for isotropic elastic materials @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the left cauchy - green strain tensor and @xmath14 is the cauchy stress tensor .",
    "the general class ( [ 9 ] ) includes cauchy elastic bodies as a special sub - class and another special subclass that is useful and is given by @xmath15 where the materials moduli @xmath16 depend on the density and the principal invariants of the cauchy stress . under the small strain assumption @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the trace norm , rajagopal @xcite obtained the approximation with @xmath19 from ( [ 10 ] ) as follows @xmath20 where as usual the materials moduli @xmath21 depend on the density in current configuration and the principal invariants of cauchy stress , @xmath22 is the linearized strain tensor .",
    "in particular , kannan , rajagopal and saccomandi @xcite proposed the following special constitutive relation : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are constants .",
    "there have been many studies carried out within the context of the new class of elastic bodies defined by ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "of relevance to the current study is the paper by kannan , rajagopal and saccomandi @xcite , wherein they investigated the unsteady motions of this new class of elastic solids .",
    "it was shown that the stress wave changes its shape since the wave speed depends on the stress and the value of stress varies according to the thickness of the slab .",
    "all these phenomena for the generated stress wave are quite different from what one observes for a classical linear elastic material .    when we restrict the constitutive relation ( [ 13 ] ) to one dimension , we obtain the one - dimensional constitutive relation @xmath26 we will assume that the constants in ( [ 16 ] ) satisfy that @xmath27 moreover , we suppose that @xmath28    the assumption ( [ 18 ] ) guarantees the following governing system of equations ( [ 14 ] ) is hyperbolic .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the riemann problem for nonlinear wave equations @xmath29 with the initial data @xmath30 where @xmath31 represent the time and spatial coordinate respectively , @xmath32 the density of elastic body , @xmath33 the cauchy stress , @xmath22 the strain , @xmath34 the particle velocity .",
    "the constant riemann data in ( [ 15 ] ) satisfy that @xmath35    riemann problem for pdes is of significance not only in physics , but also in mathematics .",
    "it is well - known that the riemann problem can be used as a building block to prove existence results for the cauchy problem for ( [ 14 ] ) with general initial data @xcite , possibly having large total variation @xcite .    for the gas dynamics equations with convex condition",
    ", the riemann problem has been well - studied ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "matsumura and mei @xcite considered the nonlinear asymptotic stability of viscous shock profile for a one - dimensional system of viscoelasticity , where the constitutive relation is non - convex .",
    "they applied the degenerate shock condition proposed by nishihara @xcite to single out an admissible shock solution . by introducing a generalized shock in @xcite , sun and sheng @xcite",
    "constructed the solutions to the riemann problem for a system of nonlinear degenerate wave equations in elasticity , for which the strain - stress function is nonconvex .",
    "for the same equations , by using the liu - entropy condition in @xcite alternatively , liu and wang @xcite completely obtained the corresponding riemann solutions , some of which are different from those in @xcite .    by liu - entropy condition , lefloch and thanh",
    "@xcite uniquely solved the riemann problem for a nonlinear hyperbolic system describing phase transitions in elastodynamics .",
    "but it is noted that the elastic model in @xcite is different from the present material by comparing the assumptions ( 1.3 ) in @xcite and ( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "a more related work was done by tzavaras @xcite , who studied the riemann problem for the equations of one - dimensional isothermal elastic materials by taking viscosity to be zero in the equations of viscoelasticity .",
    "wendroff criterion was applied at shocks to select a physically admissible one . for more recent results on riemann problems",
    ", one may refer to chapter ix and references therein by dafermos @xcite or a monograph by lefloch @xcite .",
    "we note that while there are a number of analytical solutions available for classical elastic materials , there are few ones for the previously mentioned nonclassical materials . considering the importance of analytical solutions and the riemann problem",
    ", we shall solve ( [ 14 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) with the implicit constitutive relation analytically .",
    "the riemann problem ( [ 14])-([15 ] ) is different from the classical one since the linearized strain is a function of stress and this function is nonconvex ( cf .",
    "remark 2.3 ) . from the application point of view",
    ", the mathematical results on riemann problem may be used to test whether the material belongs to the class of classical elastic bodies or the ones with an implicit constitutive relation by comparing the wave patterns in a designed experiment . remarkably , we find that there are twelve wave patterns for the considered material , while there is only one wave pattern for a classical one with the small strain .",
    "we remark that the well - posedness for the cauchy problem for one - dimensional strictly hyperbolic equations with small initial data has been established by bianchini and bressan @xcite . error estimates for the glimm approximate solution and the vanishing viscosity solution were derived in @xcite .",
    "the remaining organization of this paper is as follows : in section 2 , we briefly recall some admissibility criteria for weak solutions of hyperbolic equations .",
    "section 3 is devoted to constructing the elementary waves for our system ( [ 14 ] ) and in section 4 , we provide all the solutions to the riemann problem ( [ 14])-([15 ] ) case by case .",
    "section 5 is devoted to studying the riemann solution in detail for a physically realizable situation @xmath37 .",
    "in the community of hyperbolic equations , one often uses the lax entropy inequality @xcite to single out the unique weak solution for genuinely nonlinear hyperbolic equations ; while for general hyperbolic equations without convexity , the liu - entropy condition ( @xcite,@xcite ) is a preferable candidate , which can be viewed as a generalization of oleinik entropy condition @xcite for scalar hyperbolic conservation laws .",
    "the liu - entropy condition reads @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the speed of a shock connecting the left state @xmath40 and the right state @xmath41 .",
    "both lax entropy inequality and liu - entropy condition have been justified by the method of vanishing viscosity ( see chapter viii in dafermos @xcite ) .",
    "it is also worthy to point out that these two criteria can guarantee the shock waves are stable @xcite .    in the mechanics community ,",
    "often a more physical selection criterion is used .",

    ", there should appear an additional backward rarefaction wave .",
    "that is to say , when @xmath59 , we have to establish a two - wave solution composed of a rarefaction wave followed by a shock wave .",
