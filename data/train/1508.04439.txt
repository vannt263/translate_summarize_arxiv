    "this example shows that theorem [ thm:1 ] is sharp .",

    "this corollary yields that the maximal number of roots is asymptotically given by wilmshurst s theorem .",
    "this answers a question posed by the first author more than a decade ago .",
    "also this corollary complements the estimates on the expected number of zeros of gaussian random harmonic polynomials obtained by li and wei in @xcite and , more recently , by lerario and lundberg in @xcite .",
    "for example , for @xmath35 , @xmath36 , the expected number of zeros is @xmath37 ( @xcite ) for the gaussian harmonic polynomials and @xmath38 @xcite for the truncated gaussian harmonic polynomials . yet , corollary [ cor - znm ] yields that among all harmonic polynomials the maximal number @xmath39 of zeros occurs with positive probability , thus expanding further the results in @xcite for @xmath11 .",
    "to state our last theorem , we have to introduce the set @xmath40 where @xmath41 recall that the mapping @xmath42 is _ sense - reversing _ precisely on @xmath43 , i.e. the jacobian of the map @xmath24 is negative on @xmath43 .",
    "the boundary @xmath44 is the _ lemniscate _ @xmath45 .",

    "this implies that there are at most @xmath51 connected components of @xmath43 .    for @xmath11 ( when wilmshurst s conjecture was proven to hold @xcite ) , wilmshurst guessed ( @xcite , p.73 ) that the following might be true : `` _ in each component of @xmath43 where @xmath52 is sense reversing , the behavior of @xmath24 will be essentially determined by the @xmath53 term so there will only be one zero of @xmath24 _ '' . from that the maximal number of roots ( i.e. , @xmath16 for @xmath11 ) may be obtained by the argument principle when each connected component of @xmath43 contains a zero .",

    "domain @xmath55 and @xmath56 in @xmath55 , then @xmath57 is injective on @xmath55 .",
    "note that the theorem relates the geometry of critical lemniscates with the number of zeros , because @xmath55 can have at most one zero of the function @xmath57 if the latter is injective . in a",
    "_ non - convex _ component of @xmath43 , it is possible to have more than one zero of @xmath58 . in @xcite",
    "an example is given where a non - convex component of @xmath43 contains _ two _ critical points of @xmath46 and _ two _ zeros of @xmath52 .",
    "this is not surprising because each component of @xmath43 can have a zero of @xmath24 and , therefore , one can have two zeros in a component by merging two components into one .",
    "the resulting component then has two critical points of @xmath46 .",
    "it was however not clear whether a connected component containing a single critical point of @xmath46 could possibly have more than one zero of @xmath24 .    here",
    "we show that it _ is indeed _ possible and , also , present a necessary and sufficient condition for having more than one zero of @xmath24 in a connected component of @xmath43 that contains a _ single _ zero of @xmath50 ( i.e. , a single critical point of @xmath46 ) .",
