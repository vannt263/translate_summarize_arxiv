    "the explosion mechanism of core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) is one of the biggest interests in high - energy astrophysics .",
    "the challenge is how the stagnant shock wave revives and goes through an iron core .",
    "the most anticipated scenario is based on the so - called neutrino - heating mechanism , in which fluid behind the shock gains energy from neutrinos that diffuse out of the proto - neutron star ( pns ) and as a result the shock is pushed outward . in this scenario ,",
    "multi - dimensional fluid instabilities such as the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) and/or neutrino - driven convections are expected to play an important role to enhance the efficiency of the neutrino heating and produce shock revival .",
    "in fact , it is almost a consensus that one - dimensional , spherically symmetric simulations do not lead shock revival even with the most detailed physics implemented .",
    "the multi - dimensional fluid instabilities in ccsne have been systematically investigated by numerical simulations @xcite and also by linear analysis @xcite .",
    "the neutrino - driven convection is characterized by small - scale multiple buoyant bubbles and is driven by negative entropy gradient caused by neutrino heating .",
    "sasi , on the other hand , is characterized by large - scale deformations of the shock surface induced by sloshing and spiral motions .",
    "it is a global instability caused by the so - called advective - acoustic cycle , in which the spherical shock surface is deformed by repetitious round trips of upcoming sonic waves and down - going vorticity waves between the shock and pns surface . which of these instabilities , convection or sasi , dominates the shock dynamics is dependent on the mass accretion rate , neutrino luminosity , and hence the progenitors .",
    "multi - dimensionality is recently discussed not only in fluid instabilities but also in structures of progenitors , which was revealed by a series of papers by the groups of arnett @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they showed numerically that the silicon and oxygen shells outside the iron core in progenitors substantially deviate from spherically symmetric configurations at the onset of collapse due to nuclear burnings and associated violent convections .",
    "they have found that the power spectrum of the turbulence peaks at @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "another reported , however , the development of a larger - scale convection with @xmath2 in a different progenitor just before the collapse @xcite .",
    "their results imply that the patterns of the fluctuation may be dependent on the progenitor .",
    "such fluctuations in the outer shells will accrete onto the stagnant shock and may affect the subsequent shock dynamics .",
    "in fact , it is demonstrated by linear analysis @xcite that the fluctuations can grow rather than damp during the super - sonic infall .",
    "furthermore , @xcite and @xcite showed that the interaction of such non - spherical outer layers with the stagnant shock can produce shock revival for the progenitors that failed to explode without the fluctuations .",
    "the systematic study by @xcite reported that large scale velocity perturbations efficiently contribute to the shock revival .",
    "@xcite also found that upstream perturbations with @xmath3 do not turn the sasi - dominant flows into convectively dominated flows .",
    "thanks to the above studies , the multi - dimensional structures of progenitors have been focused as a new key ingredient to successful explosions of ccsne in addition to the fluid instabilities and other multi - dimensional players such as stellar rotation and magnetic fields @xcite . however , it has not been fully understood yet how the asymmetry in the envelopes interacts with the shock instabilities and eventually helps the stalled shock revive .    in this paper , we focus on the links between the shock instabilities and the asymmetric accretion flows that occur as consequences of the multi - dimensional structures of progenitors .",
    "we perform a linear stability analysis of the standing accretion shock by taking into account such asymmetric , unsteady accretion flows in front of the shock as the outer boundary condition , which has never been considered in previous liner analyses .",
    "we systematically study the dependence of the results on the typical frequency of the accreting fluctuations for several types of background flows , which are designed to crudely mimic the collapse of fluctuating progenitors .",
    "we also obtain some general relations analytically .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we explain the method and setups in the next section , where basic equations and laplace transform are introduced together with our models . in sec .",
    "[ numresults ] , we present the results of the global linear stability analysis of the standing accretion shock .",

    "[ sec.summary2 ] .",
    "following the main body , some appendices are added , which include analytic treatments that give the general relations between shock dynamics and perturbations .",
    "as stated in the introduction , we investigate the linear stability of the standing accretion shock against the multi - dimensional upstream perturbations .",
    "we ignore the time variation of the ( spherically symmetric , unperturbed ) flows , since the typical timescales of the changes in the neutrino luminosity and/or mass accretion rate are much longer than the timescale of the instability .    in this section",
    ", we introduce the system of basic equations and the method of laplace transform , which is the principal tool for the investigation of the linear analysis in this paper .",
    "the basic equations that govern accretion flows in the supernovae core are given as follows : @xmath4 in addition to an equation of state ( eos ) . in the above expression ,",

    "the mass of the pns is denoted by @xmath11 , which is assumed to be constant , and @xmath12 is the gravitational constant . the self - gravity is neglected .",
    "we incorporate the reactions between the electron - type neutrinos and matter , which are symbolically denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 : the former is the net heating rate and the latter is the net reaction rate of electrons and positrons .",
    "we use the light - bulb approximation instead of solving the neutrino transport @xcite . in this prescription , neutrino luminosities ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) and temperatures ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) are arbitrary parameters .",

    "we solve the linearized equations ( [ eq.linearized ] ) in the region between the standing shock and the pns surface which is assumed to coincide with the electron - type - neutrino sphere .",

    "we note here that we can impose only one condition , which determines a remaining degree of freedom at the outer boundary , i.e. , the perturbed shock radius , once the upstream flow is given .",
    "otherwise there is generally no solution that satisfies the inner and outer boundary conditions at the same time .",

    "<S> another multi - dimensional effect that has been recently argued is the asymmetric structures in progenitors , which are induced by violent convections in silicon / oxygen layers that occur before the onset of collapse , as revealed by recent numerical simulations of the last stage of massive star evolutions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it has been also demonstrated numerically that accretions of such non - spherical envelopes could facilitate shock revival . </S>",
    "<S> these two multi - dimensional may hence hold a key to successful explosions . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we performed a linear stability analysis of the standing accretion shock in core - collapse supernovae , taking into account non - spherical , unsteady accretion flows onto the shock to clarify the possible links between the two effects . </S>",
    "<S> we found that such pre - shock perturbations can excite the fluid instabilities efficiently and hence help the shock revive in core - collapse supernovae . </S>"
