    "recently , a mind - blowing , and very interesting , new physics proposal has been presented by georgi @xcite . according to this proposal",
    ", there could be a scale invariant sector with a nontrivial infrared fixed point living at a very high energy scale . since any theory with massive fields can not be scale invariant , the standard model(sm )",
    "is not a scale invariant theory .",
    "therefore , such a scale invariant sector , if any , should consist of massless fields and would interact with the sm fields at the very high energies .",
    "one of the most striking low energy properties of that proposal is that using the low energy effective theory considerations one can calculate the possible effects of such a scale invariant sector for the tev scale colliders .    in the ref.@xcite",
    ", the fields of a very high energy theory with a nontrivial fixed point are called as bz(for banks - zaks ) fields according to ref.@xcite .",
    "interactions of bz operators @xmath6 with the sm operators @xmath7 are expressed by the exchange of particles with a very high energy mass scale @xmath8 in the following form @xmath9 where bz , and sm operators are defined as @xmath10 with mass dimension @xmath11 , and @xmath12 with mass dimension @xmath13 .",
    "low energy effects of the scale invariant @xmath6 fields imply a dimensional transmutation .",
    "thus , after the dimensional transmutation eq.([1 ] ) is given as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the scaling mass dimension of the unparticle operator @xmath16 ( in ref.@xcite , @xmath17 ) , and the constant @xmath18 is a coefficient function .",
    "using the low energy effective field theory approach , very briefly summarized above , in refs @xcite , and @xcite main properties of the unparticle physics are presented .",
    "a list of feynman rules for the unparticles coupled to the sm fields , and several implications of the collider phenomenology are given in the ref.@xcite .",
    "in this paper , our calculations are based on the conventions of the ref.@xcite .",
    "searching for the new physics effects , the @xmath1 linear colliders have an exceptional advantageous for its appealing clean background , and the possibility for the options of @xmath19 , and @xmath20 colliders based on it .",
    "recently , for the new physics searches , as a multi - tev energy electron - positron linear collider , the compact linear collider(clic ) proposed and developed at cern , is seriously taken into account .",
    "numerous works on the clic have been done so far @xcite . as other @xmath1 linear colliders",
    ", the clic would have the options for @xmath21 , and @xmath20 collider options , and possibilities of polarized @xmath22 beams . in this paper",
    ", we consider the @xmath20 collider option of the clic , to search for the unparticle physics effects . our results can easily be extended for other possible future multi tev - scale linear electron - positron colliders . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a detailed analysis on @xmath20 option of an @xmath1 collider has been given .",
    "since @xmath23 process can only occur at loop - level in sm it gives a good opportunity to test of new physics which has tree level contributions to the scattering amplitude .",
    "regarding this process , as new physics searches , for example , supersymmetry @xcite , large extra dimensions @xcite , and noncommutative space - time effects @xcite has been taken into account . here , we study the effects of the unparticles on this process .",
    "the lowest order sm contributions to the @xmath23 process are 1-loop contributions of the charged fermions , and @xmath24 bosons . in the limits , for mandelstam parameters , @xmath25 , and using certain symmetry arguments given in the ref.@xcite those 1-loop contributions can be expressed briefly .",
    "we present the corresponding 1-loop sm amplitudes in the appendix [ sec : a ] .",
    "analysis of fox _",
    "@xcite , highlights that the existence of the scalar unparticle operator leads to the conformal symmetry breaking when the higgs operator gets the vacuum expectation value .",
    "if this symmetry breaking occurs at low energies some strong constraints are imposed on the unparticle sector . here",
    ", we assume that the effects of unparticle sector on future high energy collider energies could be measurable .",
    "using the low energy effective field theory assumptions of ref.s @xcite , there are three tree level diagrams contributing to @xmath26 scattering amplitude from the exchange of the scalar unparticle @xmath27 which can be expressed with the following amplitudes    @xmath28 \\big]\\epsilon^\\nu(p_2 ) \\big ] \\big [ \\epsilon^{\\rho * } ( p_3)\\big[4i\\frac{\\lambda_0}{\\lambda_u^d } [ -p_3.p_4g_{\\rho\\sigma}+p_{3\\sigma } p_{4 \\rho } ] \\big]\\epsilon^{\\sigma * } ( p_4 ) \\big ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times \\big[\\frac{i a_d}{2\\sin{d\\pi}}[-(p_1+p_2)^2]^{d-2 } \\big]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath29 \\big]\\epsilon^\\mu(p_1 ) \\big ] \\big [ \\epsilon^{\\sigma * } ( p_4)\\big[4i\\frac{\\lambda_0}{\\lambda_u^d } [ p_2.p_4g_{\\nu\\sigma}-p_{2\\sigma } p_{4 \\nu } ] \\big]\\epsilon^\\nu(p_2 ) \\big ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times \\big[\\frac{i a_d}{2\\sin{d\\pi}}[-(p_1-p_3)^2]^{d-2 } \\big]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath30 \\big]\\epsilon^\\mu(p_1 ) \\big ] \\big [ \\epsilon^{\\rho * } ( p_3)\\big[4i\\frac{\\lambda_0}{\\lambda_u^d } [ p_2.p_3g_{\\nu\\rho}-p_{2\\rho } p_{3 \\nu } ] \\big]\\epsilon^\\nu(p_2 ) \\big ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times \\big[\\frac{i a_d}{2\\sin{d\\pi}}[-(p_1-p_4)^2]^{d-2 } \\big]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the effective coupling and the energy scale for scalar unparticle operator , respectively .",

    "the implications of such a complex factor could be studied only through the interference terms .",
