    "unlike four dimensional einstein gravity , which allows existence of black holes , higher dimensional theories , such as the brane - world scenarios and string theory , allow existence of a number of `` black '' objects : higher dimensional black holes , black strings and branes , black rings and saturns and others .",
    "in higher than four dimensions we lack the uniqueness theorem , so that stability may be the criteria which will select physical solutions among this variety of solutions . up to now , we know that higher dimensional reissner - nordstrm - de sitter black holes are stable @xcite in the einstein gravity . on the contrary ,",
    "black holes in gauss - bonnet ( gb ) gravity are unstable for large gb coupling for @xmath0 @xcite , where @xmath1 is the total number of space - time dimensions .",
    "kaluza - klein black holes with squashed horizon are stable against lowest zero mode perturbations @xcite . unlike , kaluza - klein black holes , the black string metric is a solution of the einstein equations in five or higher dimensional gravity that has a factorized form consisting of the tangherlini black hole and an extra flat dimension @xcite . according to the brane - world scenarios ,",
    "if the matter localised on the brane undergoes gravitational collapse , a black hole with the horizon extended to the transverse extra direction will form .",
    "this object looks like a black hole on the brane , but is , in fact , a black string in the full d - dimensional theory .",
    "it is well known that such black strings suffer from the so - called gregory - laflamme instability , which is the long wavelength gravitational instability of the scalar type of the metric perturbations @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the gregory - laflamme instability has been intensively studied during the recent decade @xcite and the threshold values of the wave vector @xmath2 at which the instability appears are known @xcite . in the present paper we are aimed at studying the evolution of linear perturbations of d - dimensional black strings in time and frequency domains .",
    "this task is motivated mainly by the two reasons : first to realize what happens on the edge of instability of black strings and how the perturbations will develop in time .",
    "second , the so - called quasinormal modes of a stable black string might be an observational characteristic for the future large hadron collider experiments , if such objects as black strings exist .",
    "the latter needs some more explanation . in this research",
    ", we shall show that , if a stable d - dimensional black string is gravitationally perturbed , it will undergo damped oscillations , called quasinormal ringing , similar to that of a black hole @xcite . at asymptotically late time , this quasinormal ringing goes over into the power - law tails .",
    "the quasinormal modes and asymptotic tails are very well studied for d - dimensional black holes @xcite and for black holes localised on the brane @xcite .",
    "we find here that the quasinormal ringing of black strings has a number of differences from that of d - dimensional black holes @xcite , especially when approaching the edge of instability .",
    "in particular , we find a numerical evidence that in the threshold point of instability , the static solution of the wave equation is dominant . in the region of the stability , for @xmath2 slightly larger than the threshold value ,",
    "we see modes with tiny oscillation frequencies and damping rates . in the region of the gregory - laflamme instability , for @xmath2 slightly smaller than threshold value , we observe tiny oscillations and instability growth .",
    "we also find the level crossing of imaginary part of quasinormal modes between the fundamental mode and the first overtone mode .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sec ii gives basic formulas for the black string perturbations and the wave equation for the scalar type of gravitational perturbations .",
    "sec iii analyses quasinormal modes of black strings in frequency domain with the help of the frobenius method , and in time domain by the gundlah - price - pullin method .",
    "we also discuss features of the gregory - laflamme instability using the obtained results .",
    "the final section is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "in this section , we shall briefly review the results of the paper @xcite , where the wave equation for the scalar type of gravitational perturbations were obtained .",
    "this wave equation will be our starting point for numerical investigation .    for the static string in @xmath3 space - time dimensions ,",
    "the background metric can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the metric on a unit @xmath7-sphere .",
    "various properties of black string have been extensively studied in recent years and we refer a reader to the papers @xcite-@xcite for more detailed information on black strings .",
    "the @xmath8-direction is periodically identified by the relation @xmath9 .",
    "we study perturbations of an @xmath7-spherically symmetric solution with the killing vector in @xmath8-direction .",
    "therefore , we can write perturbations in the form @xmath10 the perturbed vacuum einstein equations have the form @xmath11 the perturbations can be reduced to the form , where the only non - vanishing components of @xmath12 are @xmath13 @xmath14    the linearized einstein equations give a set of coupled equations determining the four radial profiles above .",
    "however , we may eliminate @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 from these equations in order to produce a single second order equation for @xmath18 : @xmath19 where @xmath20    defining @xmath21 we can reduce the equation ( [ hovdebomyers ] ) to the wave - like equation @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the tortoise coordinate . here",
    ", the effective potential @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 the above effective potential does not vanish at asymptotic infinity but has an effective `` mass '' term , containing @xmath2 , at the spatial infinity .",
    "first of all , let us briefly describe the two methods which we used here : the frobenius method ( frequency domain ) and the gundlach - price - pullin method ( time domain ) .    in time domain , we study the black string ringing using a numerical characteristic integration method @xcite , that uses the light - cone variables @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in the characteristic initial value problem ,",
    "initial data are specified on the two null surfaces @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the discretization scheme we used , is @xmath31 where we have used the following definitions for the points : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    in frequency domain we used the well - known frobenius method @xcite .",
    "in order to study the qn spectrum in frequency domain , we have separated time and radial coordinates in ( [ hovdebomyers ] ) @xmath36 here @xmath37 satisfies the quasinormal mode boundary conditions , which are purely ingoing wave at the event horizon and purely outgoing wave at the spatial infinity .",
    "thus , the appropriate frobenius series are @xmath38 where @xmath39 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "it is crucial that @xmath43 must be regular at the event horizon and at the spatial infinity and can be expanded as @xmath44 substituting ( [ frobenius ] ) into ( [ hovdebomyers ] ) , we have found that the coefficients @xmath45 satisfy a @xmath46-term recurrence relation .",
    "we found the coefficients of the recurrence relation , and then we obtained the equation with the infinite continued fraction , which is algebraic equation with respect to the qn frequency @xmath47 .",
    "numerical solutions of this algebraic equation give us the qn spectrum .",
    ".fundamental mode ( @xmath48 ) found by the time - domain integration , first ( @xmath49 ) and second ( @xmath50 ) overtones of spherically symmetric black string perturbations ( @xmath40 ) found by the frobenius method . as @xmath2 grows , the first overtone decreases its imaginary part , becoming the fundamental mode , reaching purely real frequency ( quasi - resonance ) at @xmath51 and then disappearing .",
    "the second overtone , as well as the fundamental purely imaginary mode , increases its damping rate with @xmath2 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table iii , we listed dominant qnms of spherically symmetric black string perturbations in the case of @xmath52 .",
    "we can see the level crossing of imaginary part of quasinormal modes between the fundamental mode and the first overtone mode .",
    "the real part of the second mode ( @xmath49 in tables i , iii ) asymptotes to @xmath2 at large @xmath2 , while the imaginary part monotonically decreases when @xmath2 is increasing",
    ". the third mode does not asymptotes to @xmath2 , but has monotonically decreasing real and imaginary parts as can be seen from fig",
    ". 1 . because of the risk to `` fall '' into another overtone , in order to obtain the higher overtones",
    ", we had to start from the d - dimensional black holes with @xmath53 , for which the qn frequencies are known @xcite , and then to `` move '' towards higher @xmath2 in the frobenius method with a very small step ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .     @xmath54 ( red , top ) , @xmath52 ( orange ) , @xmath55 ( green ) , @xmath56 ( blue , bottom ) .",
    "late - time decay of perturbations for @xmath57 is @xmath58 . for lower @xmath59",
    "the law of decay is different : @xmath60 for @xmath40 and @xmath61 for @xmath54 . ]",
    "an essential advantage of the time domain method in comparison with the frobenius method is that we do not have any decreasing of the convergence or loss of accuracy when approaching the point of instability .",
    "therefore our time domain method is more complete than the frequency one , at least for the dominant mode , which can always be extracted from the time domain picture . in fig .",
    "2 , one can see examples of time domain profiles for various @xmath59 and a fixed @xmath2 .",
    "there one can see that for @xmath62 the intermediate late time asymptotic is power law like @xmath63 while for other @xmath59 , the asymptotics are @xmath64 @xmath65 let us note that this asymptotic apparently should be considered as intermediate .",
    "they are expected to go over into other power law ones at very late times , as it takes place for massive fields in general @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let us note , that @xmath2 plays the role of the effective mass . at asymptotically late time we observe power - law damped tails , which have oscillation frequency equal to @xmath2 , resembling asymptotical behavior of massive fields near schwarzschild black holes .",
    "the first overtone s behavior is qualitatively similar to that of the fundamental mode for massive fields of higher - dimensional schwarzschild black holes @xcite : we can see long - lived oscillations , which can be infinitely long lived modes called the quasi - resonances @xcite .",
    "the analytical explanation of existence of the quasi - resonances was found in @xcite .    * for @xmath66 ( @xmath40 )",
    ", as @xmath2 grows , the imaginary part of the first overtone quickly decreases and vanishes for some threshold value of @xmath2 , while its real part stays smaller than the threshold value ( see table [ n=1.table ] ) .",
    "after the threshold value of @xmath2 is reached , the first overtone `` disappears '' . * for @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) , the imaginary part of the first overtone becomes small for large @xmath2 , while the real part asymptotically approaches @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ n=2.fig ] ) .    even though the first overtone of the spherically symmetric black strings behaves similarly to the fundamental mode of massive fields near higher - dimensional schwarzschild black holes , the other modes have completely different behavior",
    ". the fundamental mode of a black string perturbation is purely imaginary .",
    "it grows for small values of @xmath2 , leading to instability of the black string .",
    "this behavior is common for the unstable modes .",
    "indeed , let us multiply the equation ( [ wavelike ] ) by the complex conjugated function @xmath69 and assume that the dependance on time is @xmath70 .",
    "let us study the integral of the obtained equation @xmath71 integration of the first term by parts gives @xmath72 taking into account the boundary conditions ( [ frobenius ] ) , we find that the imaginary part of the integral is @xmath73 since the sign of @xmath74 coincides with the sign of @xmath75 , the non - zero real part of the quasi - normal frequency implies that the imaginary part is negative .",
    "therefore , the unstable modes ( @xmath76 ) must have zero real part . in other words ,",
    "_ unstable modes can not be oscillating_.     @xmath77 ( magenta , top ) , @xmath78 ( red ) , @xmath79 ( orange ) , @xmath80 ( green ) , @xmath81 ( blue , bottom ) .",
    "we can see two concurrent modes : for large @xmath2 the oscillating one dominates , near the critical value of @xmath2 the dominant mode does not oscillate ( looks like exponential tail ) , for unstable values of @xmath2 the dominant mode grows .",
    "the plot is logarithmic , so that straight lines correspond to an exponential decay . ]",
    "+     in the stability region , the fundamental mode is also purely imaginary , but damped mode , whose damping rate grows quickly with @xmath2 . because of its quick growth , this mode can not be considered as the fundamental one for large @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , for larger @xmath2 ( see tables i - iii ) , the first overtone turns out to be the fundamental mode ( the mode with the largest lifetime ) .",
    "the real part of the second overtone decreases , as @xmath2 grows , and reaches zero for some value of @xmath2 , while the imaginary part remains negative .",
    "let us now look at the fig.3 .",
    "at moderately large values of @xmath2 , sufficiently far from instability , the profile has the same form as that for massive fields , yet , when approaching the instability point the real oscillation frequency ( @xmath82 ) and the decay rate ( @xmath83 ) decrease considerably . after crossing the instability point",
    "we observe , that starting from some tiny values , @xmath84 are slowly increasing ( while @xmath82 is still zero for the fundamental mode and tiny oscillations , observed in the time domain , come from the next decayed mode ) .",
    "therefore we conclude , that the there is some _ static solution _",
    "@xmath85 of the wave equation ( 4 ) , which shows itself _ exactly in the threshold point of instability_. we would say that this picture of instability is natural , if the instability develops on the fundamental mode .",
    "however , if instability occurs at higher multipoles @xmath86 , as it takes place for instance in the gauss - bonnet theory @xcite , the picture of instability is quite different : growing modes appear only after rather long period of decaying oscillations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note also , that here we confirmed the threshold values of @xmath2 found in @xcite with a very good accuracy by the time domain integration ( see for instance fig . 3 for @xmath40 ) .",
    "thus the threshold values are : @xmath87 for @xmath40 , @xmath88 for @xmath54 , @xmath89 for @xmath52 , @xmath90 for @xmath55 .    finally , in fig .",
    "4 , we can see the region of the profiles where the period of the quasinormal ringing goes over into the power - law tail behavior .",
    "close to the critical point , there exists a period where the oscillation ceases .",
    "this is because the pure damping mode becomes the fundamental mode near the critical point .",
    "we have numerically studied the gregory - laflamme instability through quasinormal modes .",
    "let us stress three main results obtained here :    \\1 ) we have found the quasinormal modes and late - time tails for scalar type of gravitational perturbations of d - dimensional black strings for various @xmath1 , that is for the type of perturbations where the gregory - laflamme instability forms in the long wavelength regime .",
    "\\3 ) near the instability point ( in @xmath2 ) the fundamental mode is pure imaginary ( non - oscillating ) , and , as @xmath2 is increasing , the lifetime of the second mode is increasing , so that at some moderate @xmath2 both modes are dominating at the late time of the ringing . at larger @xmath2",
    ", the dominance goes over to the second ( oscillating ) mode , as to the longer lived one .",
    "our research could be improved in a number of ways .",
    "first of all , one could compute qnms for higher multipole numbers , starting from the effective potential derived in @xcite and also for other types of gravitational perturbation . though vector and tensor types of perturbations do not contain instabilities ,",
    "such investigation would give us complete data on qnms and evolution of gravitational perturbations .",
    "the main limitation of our analysis is that we can not say what happen with unstable black string some time since the moment of initial perturbations : the perturbations will grow and become large , so that the linear approximation will not be valid anymore .",
    "however , it is beyond the scope of this paper .",
