    "molecular motors are proteins that convert the free energy released from chemical reactions into directed movements @xcite . here",
    "we focus on linear cytoskeletal motors which move along cytoskeletal filaments .",
    "many of these motors are processive in the sense that a single motor molecule can move a cargo over a large distance .",
    "the most prominent examples are ( conventional ) kinesin and certain types of myosins , which move along microtubules and actin filaments , respectively . in the cell ,",
    "these motors are involved in transport processes , reorganization of the cytoskeleton and cell division @xcite .",
    "however , experiments on the movements of molecular motors can also be done in vitro , which has lead to the development of various single molecule assays . in these experiments",
    ", one can measure the velocities , step sizes , walking distances and forces for single motor molecules , see , e.g.  @xcite . in additions ,",
    "they have stimulated a lot of theoretical work devoted to the walks of molecular motors along filaments , see , e.g.  @xcite .    in the experiments",
    ", one observes that even processive motors unbind from their filamentous tracks after a certain walking distance , which is typically of the order of 1  @xmath0 m . for a kinesin molecule , this means that it makes about 100 steps of 8  nm before unbinding @xcite .",
    "myosin  v motors have a comparable walking distance , but a larger step size of 36  nm , so that they detach after about 3050 steps @xcite .",
    "unbound motors then diffuse in the surrounding fluid until they rebind to the same or another filament and continue their directed walk .    on larger scales ,",
    "the motors thus perform complex random walks , which consist of alternating sequences of directed movements along filaments and non - directed diffusion in the surrounding fluid , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : randwalk ] .",
    "these random walks have been discussed by ajdari using scaling arguments @xcite .",
    "recently , we have introduced lattice models to describe the random walks of the motors as random walks on a lattice , where certain lines of lattice sites represent the filaments @xcite . when bound to these lines ,",
    "the motors perform directed random walks .",
    "detachment from these lines is allowed to occur with a small , but non - zero probability .",
    "diffusive motion in the surrounding fluid is described by symmetric random walks .",
    "these models are designed to study generic properties of motor movements , but they can also be used to describe specific motor molecules , since all model parameters can be determined from the measured transport properties , see ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , motor  motor interactions can be easily included into these models , e.g. , mutual exclusion of motors from the binding sites of the filaments , which leads to self - organized density profiles in closed systems @xcite and boundary - induced phase transitions in open tube systems @xcite .",
    "for the random walks of single motors or , equivalently , for an ensemble of non - interacting motors , we have obtained a number of exact results for the cases of a single filament embedded in two - dimensional or three - dimensional space as reported in @xcite . in particular , these random walks exhibit anomalous drift behavior ; the average position of the motor advances slower than linearly with time .",
    "the same drift behavior is found for the movement along a single filament immobilized in open compartments with the same dimensionality , which are more easily accessible to experiments @xcite . in the present article",
    ", we present a detailed derivation of the analytical results of ref .",
    "@xcite for movements in two and three dimensions without confining boundaries .",
    "analytical results are obtained by the following method , which is a variant of the method of fourier ",
    "laplace transforms for random walks in homogeneous space , see , e.g. , @xcite : by using fourier  laplace transforms of the probability distributions , the master equations of the random walk can be transformed into a set of algebraic equations , one of which , however , requires the evaluation of a non - trivial integral .",
    "solving these algebraic equations , solutions for the fourier ",
    "laplace transformed probability distributions and their moments are obtained and closed expressions in terms of integrals can be derived for the time - dependent probability distributions and moments .",
    "these can , on the one hand , be evaluated numerically to obtain results for all times ; on the other hand , asymptotic results for small and large times can be obtained fully analytically by using the tauberian theorems , which we summarize in the appendix . in this way",
    ", we derive expressions for the fraction of bound motors , the average displacement and dispersion , and the effective velocities and diffusion coefficients .",
    "the analytical results are compared to data from monte carlo simulation and are found to be in very good agreement .",
    "in addition to the anomalous drift behavior , the random walks of molecular motors also exhibit strongly enhanced diffusion in the direction parallel to the filament .",
    "our article is organized as follows : we start with the two - dimensional case in section [ sec:2d ] and discuss the three - dimensional case in section [ sec:3d ] . in both cases ,",
    "we derive probability distributions and their moments for both the bound and unbound motor .",
    "the fact that filaments may consist of several protofilaments is taken into account in the final subsections of sections [ sec:2d ] and [ sec:3d ] , where these are modeled by several internal states of the bound motors . in section [ sec : sticking_prob ] , we extend the discussion to include a variable sticking probability for motors arriving at the filament . at the end , we include a short summary of our results .",
