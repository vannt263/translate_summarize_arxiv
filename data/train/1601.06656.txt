    "<S> background : :    multinucleon transfer ( mnt ) and quasifission ( qf ) processes are    dominant processes in low - energy collisions of two heavy nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> they    are expected to be useful to produce neutron - rich unstable nuclei .    </S>",
    "<S> nuclear dynamics leading to these processes depends sensitively on    nuclear properties such as deformation and shell structure . </S>",
    "<S> purpose : :    we elucidate reaction mechanisms of mnt and qf processes involving    heavy deformed nuclei , making detailed comparisons between microscopic    time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) calculations and measurements for    the @xmath0ni+@xmath1u reaction . </S>",
    "<S> methods : :    three - dimensional skyrme - tdhf calculations are performed .    particle - number projection method is used to evaluate mnt cross    sections from the tdhf wave function after collision . </S>",
    "<S> results : :    fragment masses , total kinetic energy ( tke ) , scattering angle , contact    time , and mnt cross sections are investigated for the    @xmath0ni+@xmath1u reaction . </S>",
    "<S> they show    reasonable agreements with measurements . at small impact parameters ,    </S>",
    "<S> collision dynamics depends sensitively on the orientation of deformed    @xmath1u . in tip ( side ) </S>",
    "<S> collisions , we find a larger    ( smaller ) tke and a shorter ( longer ) contact time . in tip collisions ,    </S>",
    "<S> we find a strong influence of quantum shells around    @xmath2pb . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : :    it is confirmed that the tdhf calculations reasonably describe both    mnt and qf processes in the    @xmath0ni+@xmath1u reaction . </S>",
    "<S> analyses of this    system indicate the significance of the nuclear structure effects such    as deformation and quantum shells in nuclear reaction dynamics at low    energies . </S>"
