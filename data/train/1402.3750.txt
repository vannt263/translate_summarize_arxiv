    "disks are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems at all scales , found almost anywhere an axis of symmetry exists , and play an important role in the appearance and evolution of these systems . for example",
    ", they are essential for the creation of planetary systems , formation of young stars , mass - transfer in binary systems , and fueling of the central engines in active galactic nuclei , even though the physical properties of both the disks and their host systems differ dramatically .    disks may also exist around isolated neutron stars , possibly formed from fallback material after supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "when a massive star dies in a supernova explosion , some amount of the ejecta ( @xmath6 ) may `` fallback '' onto the newly formed neutron star @xcite . if much of the material is captured by the gravitational field of the neutron star and has sufficiently high angular momentum to prevent direct infall onto this compact star , a disk forms due to interactions between streams of the captured material .",
    "there are a number of observational puzzles relating to radio pulsars that could be explained by disks @xcite .",
    "the evolution of pulse periods with time for most pulsars does not actually follow the detailed predictions of magnetic dipole radiation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which could be due to disks @xcite exerting excess torque on the pulsars magnetospheres .",
    "in addition , some unique phenomena seen in individual pulsars , such as jets and neutron star precession , may arise from disks @xcite .",
    "the first extra - solar planet system was discovered around the radio pulsar b1257 + 12 @xcite .",
    "even though the source is a millisecond pulsar with a complicated evolutionary path , it is generally believed that the planetary system had formed from a debris disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there is a type of radio emitting neutron stars , called rotating radio transients ( rrats ; @xcite ) , which are characterized by short , periodic radio bursts ( 230 ms ) spaced by long intervals ( ranging from minutes to hours ) .",
    "the bursts , along with other variations in radio pulses  such as pulse nulling , drifting subpulses , and mode changes , might be caused by dusty material from a surrounding debris disk falling into the magnetosphere of a pulsar @xcite .",
    "motivated by the discovery of the planetary system around psr b1257 + 12 , searches for debris disks around neutron stars have concentrated on old radio pulsars , but with no success ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these searches were however limited by the choice of targets ( older , less energetic pulsars ) and the instrumentation ( poor sensitivity and angular resolution ) .",
    "multi - wavelength searches for fallback disks around a number of young neutron stars have been conducted ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although these are considered as high - energy objects , namely , central compact objects ( ccos ; @xcite ) and magnetars @xcite , rather than ordinary / traditional radio pulsars .",
    "the former are a class of radio - quiet x - ray point sources at the centers of young supernova remnants while the latter are believed to generally have ultra - high surface magnetic fields ( @xmath7  g ; @xcite ) .    using the _ spitzer space telescope _ , the infrared ( ir ) counterparts to the magnetars 4u 0142 + 61 and 1e  2259 + 586 have been found @xcite .",
    "for the former source , no single spectral model , such as a blackbody or a power law , can fit its combined optical and ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "instead , it is very likely that the ir emission arises from a residual dust disk .",
    "this disk , with estimated mass of @xmath810@xmath9 , is heated by strong x - rays from the central pulsar ( @xmath10 erg s@xmath11 ) and appears bright at ir wavelengths ( for example , @xmath12 ergs s@xmath11 ) .",
    "the disk s lifetime was estimated to be @xmath13  yr , assuming that the magnetar has been spun down by mass accretion from the putative disk @xcite .",
    "the lifetime significantly exceeds the pulsar age ( @xmath14 yr ) , suggesting a supernova fallback origin @xcite . while there were only @xmath0-band and _ spitzer _  4.5 @xmath1 m detections of 1e  2259 + 586 , the overall ir emission is similar to that of 4u 0142 + 61 , suggesting the possible existence of a debris disk around this magnetar @xcite .    in order to explore the general existence of similar residual disks around isolated neutron stars , we have carried out disk searches around a few relatively young radio pulsars .",
    "the detectability of the disk around 4u  0142 + 61 is likely the result of a combination of the very strong x - ray heating of the disk and the relative youth of the object . for radio pulsars , their winds that carry",
    "much of their spin - down luminosity and contain energetic particles may heat a debris disk , producing ir emission @xcite .",
    "some fraction of the spin - down luminosity is conceivably assumed to illuminate surrounding disks .    in this paper",
    "we report the results of disk searches around seven relatively young pulsars from our ground - based and _ spitzer _  observations .",
    "the pulsar targets were carefully selected partly on the basis of an initial near - ir @xmath0-band survey .",
    "results from the all - sky survey conducted by the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ ) were included . in addition , in order to understand the role of x - ray emission from neutron stars in disk heating ( or disk detectability ) , x - ray flux values or upper limits of the seven pulsars , either from the literature or archival data analysis conducted by us , were also reported .",
    "below we first describe our target selection in section  [ subsec : ts ] .",
    "the observations and data analysis are described in section  [ sec : obs ] , and the results and discussion are presented in sections  [ sec : res ] and [ sec : dis ] , respectively .",
    "we selected sources from the pulsar catalog @xcite based on the spin - down luminosity @xmath15 scaled by distance @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and picked the top 40 young , energetic pulsars that had not been well observed in the optical / ir bands .",
    "as one might expect near - ir emission from these systems if debris disks are present , we undertook observations in the @xmath0 band using the 6.5-m magellan telescopes ( see section  [ sec : obs ] ) . however , in no case did we find a near - ir counterpart .",
    "based on the ground - based observations , we then selected seven pulsars ( see table  [ tab : tgt ] ) as our targets for _ spitzer _  observations .",
    "the reasons for the selection are the following .",
    "first , they are relatively nearby , with a typical distance of 4 kpc",
    ". a debris disk with temperature of approximately 1000  k @xcite would be bright in the mid - ir at that distance .",
    "second , these targets are not surrounded by synchrotron nebulae that can envelope some of the most energetic pulsars @xcite and could hide mid - ir emission from the pulsar itself .",
    "third and most important , since most pulsars are located primarily in the galactic plane , the confusion with field stars is a serious problem .",
    "these targets were selected because they are in less crowded fields . using the galactic disk dust map @xcite , we estimated the extinction along each source s direction .",
    "the maximum extinction for our targets is approximately @xmath18 ( for three high galactic latitude sources , they only have @xmath19 ) .",
    "this limits the extinction effect that could alter the apparent stellar colors and cause us to mistake it for a disk .    to our target selection we added one other source : rrat j1317@xmath205759 .",
    "this object , which just emits sporadic bursts of radio waves , would not be detected simply based on our spin - down luminosity argument .",
    "however , the mechanism for the radio bursting is not clearly understood , and may be related to a surrounding debris disk @xcite . given that this source also has a clean field , we selected it as our target for testing this hypothesis .",
    "we observed the fields of the seven pulsar targets in the @xmath0 band using persson s auxiliary nasmyth infrared camera ( panic ; @xcite ) on the 6.5-m baade magellan telescope at las campanas observatory in chile .",
    "the observation dates are provided in table  [ tab : obs ] .",

    "for the targets except b0950 + 08 , 2060 2mass stars were used for the calibration , and the resulting uncertainties are of the order of 003 . therefore , the positional uncertainties for locating the six pulsars on the images are dominated by the 2mass systematic uncertainty of @xmath22015 . for b0950 + 08",
