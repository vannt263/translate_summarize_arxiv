    "understanding how statistical properties emerge from microscopic models of many - particle systems has always been of fundamental interest in several fields in physics .",
    "this topic has been extensively studied in the context of classical systems . we know",
    "that if we perturb a generic isolated gas in many different ways , it will still relax to a unique ( maxwell ) velocity distribution determined by its energy .",
    "this universal behavior ( thermalization ) has been understood in terms of dynamical chaos , namely , the nonlinear equations that drive the dynamics ensure that the system explores ergodically all the available phase space @xcite .",
    "however , there is a class of models , known as integrable models , for which the presence of a complete set of conserved quantities precludes thermalization . in this case , dictated by the initial conditions , the dynamics",
    "is restricted to a limited region of phase space .",
    "more than fifty years ago , fermi , pasta , and ulam ( fpu ) @xcite set up one of the first numerical experiments to study how thermalization takes place in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattice of harmonic oscillators once nonlinear couplings were added .",
    "no signals of ergodicity were found .",
    "those unexpected results led to intensive research @xcite and ultimately to the development of the modern chaos theory @xcite .",
    "recent advances in cooling and trapping atomic gases has led to increased interest in understanding what happens in the quantum case . in those experiments , the high degree of isolation , combined with the possibility of controlling interactions and",
    "the effective dimensionality of the gas , has allowed experimentalists to realize @xcite and explore the dynamics @xcite of nearly integrable 1d systems .",
    "thermalization was not observed in one of the experiments @xcite but was indirectly confirmed in the other @xcite .",
    "those results have motivated intense theoretical research on the dynamics and thermalization of isolated quantum systems after a sudden quench , both in the integrable @xcite and nonintegrable @xcite regimes .    here , we review results for 1d systems of hard - core bosons ( hcbs ) on a lattice .",
    "we show that thermalization does not occur ( in general ) when the system is integrable .",
    "however , observables after relaxation can be described by a generalization of the gibbs ensemble @xcite .",
    "as integrability is broken , thermalization does take place @xcite , and is shown to follow after the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the hcb hamiltonian of interest reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is the nearest ( next - nearest ) neighbor hopping , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is the nearest ( next - nearest ) neighbor interaction , and @xmath5 is an external potential .",
    "the hcb creation ( annihilation ) operator in each site is denoted by @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , and the site number occupation by @xmath8 .",
    "we note that in addition to the standard commutation relations for bosons , hcb operators satisfy the additional constraints @xmath9 , which preclude multiple occupancy of the lattice sites . for @xmath10 , and any value of @xmath3",
    ", this model is integrable .",
    "the approaches used to study this model are described below .",
    "this problem can be exactly solved if one realizes that the hcb hamiltonian can be mapped onto a spin hamiltonian by means of the holstein - primakoff transformation @xcite , @xmath12 and that the spin hamiltonian can be mapped onto a noninteracting fermion hamiltonian utilizing the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite @xmath13 for simplicity , we will assume open boundary conditions .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian for the noninteracting fermions reads @xmath14 and , since it is quadratic , it can be easily diagonalized .",
    "hence , hcbs and noninteracting fermions share the same spectrum .",
    "the density profiles and any density - density correlations will also coincide in both systems .",
    "the nontrivial differences between hcbs and noninteracting fermions are revealed by the off - diagonal correlations . in particular",
    ", we will be interested in the time evolution of the equal - time one - particle correlations @xmath15 , needed to compute the momentum distribution function . once again , using @xmath16 , and we focus on how to compute @xmath17 . using ,",
    "@xmath18 can be written as @xcite @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the initial state ( a slater determinant ) , @xmath21 is the number of particles , and @xmath22 the time variable .",
    "the action of exponentials whose exponents are bilinear on fermionic creation and annihilation operators , as @xmath23 is in this case , on slater determinants generate new slater determinants , so @xmath24 .",
    "the matrix @xmath25 can be computed as @xmath26 , where we have used that @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenenergies and @xmath29 is the unitary matrix of eigenvectors .",
    "furthermore , the action of @xmath30 on @xmath31 changes the sign of @xmath32 for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and the creation of a particle at site @xmath35 implies the addition of a column with only one nonzero element ( @xmath36 ) [ the same applies to the action of @xmath37 on the left of eq .",
    "( [ rigol_greend1 ] ) ] . hence , @xmath38.\\label{rigol_green2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eq .  , the matrix elements @xmath39 and @xmath40 have the form @xmath41 with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 . equation   follows from by using the identity @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the levi - civita symbol in @xmath47 dimensions , and the indices @xmath48 have values between 1 and @xmath47 . employing eq .  , @xmath49 can be calculated in polynomial time , which scales as @xmath50 , using a computer .",
    "we will also be interested in describing the momentum distribution function after relaxation by using statistical ensembles .",
    "a polynomial time approach in this case is only known within the grand - canonical formalism @xcite .",
    "the one - particle density matrix in this ensemble can be written as @xmath51 where , @xmath52 is the chemical potential , @xmath53 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath54 is the temperature , and @xmath55 ( which is the same for hcbs and fermions ) is the partition function . to arrive to eq .",

    ", we will make use of full exact diagonalization ( see _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "this approach has the disadvantage that the dimension of the matrices that need to be diagonalized scales exponentially with system size .",
    "since the hamiltonian conserves the total number of particles , we work with a fixed number of particles @xmath75 , which reduces the dimension of our problem from @xmath76 to @xmath77 . to further reduce the dimension of the matrices to be diagonalized , we consider systems with periodic boundary conditions and no external potential ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "then , by using translational symmetry , we can block diagonalize the hamiltonian , with the size of each momentum block being @xmath78 the size of the original matrix .",

    "this means that we start with some eigenstate of an initial hamiltonian , which may not be the ground state , then at @xmath91 some parameter is changed and the system is allowed to evolve . independently of whether the hamiltonian is integrable or not , one can always write the initial state wavefunction @xmath92 in the eigenstate basis of the final hamiltonian , i.e. , @xmath93 with @xmath94 and @xmath95 . the dynamics of the wave - function takes the form @xmath96 and the expectation value of any observable @xmath97 can be written as @xmath98 , where @xmath99 .",
