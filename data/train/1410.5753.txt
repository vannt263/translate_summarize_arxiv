    "people have proposed various baryogensis mechanisms to understand the cosmic matter - antimatter asymmetry which is as same as a baryon asymmetry .",
    "the leptogenesis @xcite in seesaw @xcite context has become one of the most attractive baryogenesis mechanisms because it can simultaneously explain the generation of baryon asymmetry and the smallness of neutrino masses .",
    "however , the conventional leptogenesis scenario contains many free parameters so that it can not give the exact dependence of the baryon asymmetry on the neutrino mass matrix unless we do some assumptions on the texture of the relevant masses and couplings .",
    "for example , we can expect a successful leptogenesis in the canonical seesaw model even if the neutrino mass matrix does nt contain any cp phases @xcite .    in this paper we shall propose a new leptogenesis scenario in an @xmath0 left - right symmetric @xcite model to give some predictions on the mass scale @xmath2 and the cp violation @xmath3 of the dirac neutrinos .",
    "motivated by solving the strong cp problem without introducing an unobserved axion @xcite , we will consider a softly broken parity symmetry under which the dimensionless couplings of the @xmath4 mirror fields are identified to the couplings of the @xmath5 ordinary fields .",
    "the mirror dirac neutrinos can have a heavy mass matrix proportional to the seesaw - suppressed @xcite mass matrix of the ordinary dirac neutrinos . through the @xmath6 gauge interactions ,",
    "the mirror neutrinos can decay to produce a lepton asymmetry in the mirror muons and an opposite lepton asymmetry in the mirror electrons .",
    "both of the mirror muons and electrons can decay into the ordinary right - handed leptons with some dark matter scalars .",
    "but the lifetime of the mirror muons can be shorter than that of the mirror electrons .",
    "this means the mirror electron asymmetry can be expected not to participate in the @xmath7 sphaleron processes . in other words , only the mirror muon asymmetry can be partially converted to a baryon asymmetry .",
    "the @xmath8 charged fields include the following fermions , @xmath9 q'^{}_{r}(2,+\\frac{1}{6}),~\\ ! d'^{}_{l}(1,-\\frac{1}{3}),~\\ ! u'^{}_{l}(1,+\\frac{2}{3}),~\\!l'^{}_{r}(2,-\\frac{1}{2}),~\\ ! e'^{}_{l}(1,-1);\\end{array}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the following scalars , @xmath10 here the ordinary fields without prime are charged under the @xmath5 gauge groups while the mirror fields with prime are charged under the @xmath11 gauge symmetry .",
    "we also have three @xmath12$]-singlet scalars which are nontrivial under the @xmath13 symmetries , @xmath14 with the brackets being the @xmath13 charges .",
    "furthermore , we introduce the ordinary right - handed neutrinos and the mirror left - handed neutrinos , @xmath15 which are @xmath16 singlets but carry a quantum number @xmath17 under an additional @xmath18 gauge symmetry . the scalars @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be distinguished as they are assumed to have the @xmath18 charges @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the parity invariant yukawa interactions involving the above fields then can be written down , @xmath23    the ordinary fermions(scalars ) are odd(even ) under a @xmath24 discrete symmetry while the mirror fermions(scalars ) are odd(even ) under a @xmath25 discrete symmetry .",
    "this @xmath26 symmetry will not be broken at any scales .",
    "therefore , the scalars @xmath27 will not acquire any nontrivial vacuum expectation values .",
    "at least two of the scalars @xmath27 can keep stable because of their couplings , @xmath28 we can consider an @xmath12$]-singlet scalar @xmath29 with a proper @xmath13 charge such as @xmath30 to spontaneously break the present @xmath13 down to the usual @xmath31 .",
    "subsequently , the @xmath32$]-doublet scalar @xmath33 and the @xmath34$]-doublet scalar @xmath35 will drive the spontaneous symmetry breaking @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively . as for the @xmath18 , it will be spontaneously broken when an @xmath38$]-singlet scalar , @xmath39 develops its vacuum expectation value . in the presence of the cubic terms as below ,",
