    "the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite has revealed the deep relations between gauge theories and string theories and has provided powerful tools for understanding the dynamics of strongly coupled field theories in the dual gravity side . in recent years , this paradigm has been applied to investigate the properties of certain condensed matter systems  @xcite .",
    "the correspondence between gravity theories and condensed matter physics(sometimes is also named as ads / cmt correspondence ) has shed light on studying physics in the real world in the context of holography .",
    "it is well known that in realistic condensed matter systems , the presence of a finite density of charge carriers is of great importance . according to the ads / cft correspondence , the dual bulk gravitational background should be charged black holes in asymptotically ads spacetimes .",
    "the simplest example of such charged ads black holes is reissner - nordstrm - ads(rn - ads ) black hole , which has proven to be an efficient laboratory for studying the ads / cmt correspondence .",
    "for instance , investigations of the fermionic two - point functions in this background indicated the existence of fermionic quasi - particles with non - fermi liquid behavior  @xcite , while the @xmath5 symmetry of the extremal rn - ads black hole is crucial to the emergent scaling symmetry at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "moreover , adding a charged scalar in such background leads to superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "a further step towards a holographic model - building of strongly - coupled systems at finite charge density is to consider the leading relevant ( scalar ) operator in the field theory side , whose bulk gravity theory is an einstein - maxwell - dilaton system with a scalar potential .",
    "such theories at zero charge density were analyzed in detail in recent years as they mimic certain essential properties of qcd  @xcite .",
    "solutions at finite charge density have been considered in  @xcite in the context of ads / cmt correspondence .",
    "recently a general framework for the discussion of the holographic dynamics of einstein - maxwell - dilaton systems with a scalar potential was proposed in  @xcite , which was a phenomenological approach based on the concept of effective holographic theory ( eht ) .",
    "the minimal set of bulk fields contains the metric @xmath6 , the gauge field @xmath7 and the scalar @xmath8 ( dual to the relevant operator ) .",
    "@xmath8 appears in two scalar functions that enter the effective action : the scalar potential and the non - minimal maxwell coupling .",
    "they studied thermodynamics of certain exact solutions and computed the dc and ac conductivity .",
    "the main advantage of this eht approach is that it permits a parametrization of large classes of ir dynamics and allows investigations on important observarables .",
    "however , it is not clear whether concrete ehts can be embedded into string theories . for subsequent generalizations",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , strongly coupled quantum liquids play an important role in condensed matter physics , where quantum liquids mean translationally invariant systems at zero ( or low ) temperature and at finite density . by",
    "now there are two successful phenomenological theories of quantum liquids : landau s fermi - liquid theory and the theory of quantum bose liquids , describing two different behaviors of a quantum liquid at low momenta and temperatures .",
    "in particular , the specific heat of a bose liquid at low temperature is proportional to @xmath9 in @xmath10 spatial dimensions , while the specific heat of a fermi liquid scales as @xmath11 at low @xmath11 , irrespective of the spatial dimensions .",
    "one may wonder if the newly developed techniques in ads / cft correspondence can help us understand the behavior of quantum liquids . in  @xcite the authors",
    "considered a class of gauge theories with fundamental fields whose holographic dual in the appropriate limit was given in terms of the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action in ads space .",
    "they found that the specific heat@xmath12 in @xmath13 spatial dimensions at low temperature and the system supported a sound mode at zero temperature , which was called `` zero - temperature sound '' .",
    "one interesting feature was that the `` holographic zero sound '' mode was almost identical to the zero sound in fermi liquids : the real part of the dispersion relation was linear in momentum ( @xmath14 ) and the imaginary part had the same @xmath15 dependence predicted by landau .",
    "the crucial difference was that the zero - temperature sound velocity coincided with the first - sound velocity , while generically the two velocities are not equal for a fermi liquid .",
    "such analysis was performed in the case of massive charge carriers in  @xcite and in the case of sakai - sugimoto model in  @xcite .",
    "the specific heat of general @xmath16 systems was calculated in  @xcite and the specific heat of lifshitz black holes was discussed in  @xcite and  @xcite , while the zero sound was also investigated in  @xcite .    in this paper we will study the low - temperature specific heat and the holographic zero sound in effective holographic theories . here",
    "the bulk effective theory is @xmath0-dimensional einstein gravity coupled to a maxwell term with non - minimal coupling and a scalar .",
    "it was found in  @xcite that the theory admitted both extremal and near - extremal solutions with anisotropic scaling symmetry .",
    "we consider dynamics of probe d - branes in the above mentioned backgrounds and find that by appropriately fixing the parameters in the effective theory , the specific heat can be proportional to @xmath11 , resembling a fermi liquid .",
    "we also compute the current - current retarded green functions at low frequency and low momentum , and clarify the conditions when a quasi - particle excitation exists .",
    "moreover , we also explore the possibility of observing the existence of fermi surfaces in such a system by numerical methods .",
    "we find that although the system possesses some features of fermi liquids , such as linear specific heat and zero sound excitation , we do not observe any characteristic structure in the wide range of @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , the ac conductivity is also obtained as a by - product .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : the exact solutions of the effective bulk theory will be reviewed in section 2 and the thermodynamics of massless charge carriers will be discussed in section 3 .",
    "we shall calculate the correlation functions in section 4 and identify the quasi - particle behavior , while the existence of fermi surfaces will be explored in section 5 via numerics .",
    "we will calculate the ac conductivity in section 6 , including the zero density limit .",
    "finally we will give a summary and discuss future directions .",
    "in this section we will review the solutions obtained in  @xcite , which can be seen as generalizations of the four - dimensional near - extremal scaling solution discussed in  @xcite . in the beginning we consider the following action in @xmath0-dimensions , without any reference to string theory or m / theory origin nor specifying the forms of the gauge coupling @xmath18 and the scalar potential @xmath19 explicitly , @xmath20.\\ ] ]",
    "the resulting solutions are charged dilaton black holes , which have been investigated in the literature for a long period  @xcite .",
    "let us focus on solutions carrying electric charge only .",
    "the general configuration with planar symmetry can be written as follows @xmath21 after plugging in the scaling ansatz @xmath22 into the equations of motion , we can arrive at several constraints on the parameters and the scalar functions :    * we require that @xmath23 , so that the extremal solutions have smooth connections to the finite temperature solutions ; * the field equations indicate that @xmath24 and @xmath25 and @xmath26 when the scale invariance is restored .",
    "* the equations of motion determine that the scalar field must take the form @xmath27 and both @xmath18 and @xmath19 are constrained to be exponential in @xmath8 , power law in @xmath28 .",
    "* once we have fixed @xmath23 , the metric must have @xmath29 , where saturation occurs for vanishing flux , e.g. in @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "subsequently , according to the constraints discussed above , we take the following forms of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath32 then we will consider charged dilaton black holes with a liouville potential  @xcite .",
    "now the scaling ansatz turns out to be @xmath33 since @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be eliminated by rescaling @xmath28 and @xmath36 , we shall set @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the remaining parameters can be explicitly given in terms of @xmath39 , @xmath40^{2}}{(d-2)(2+\\alpha^{2}+\\alpha\\eta ) [ 2(d-2)+(d-1)\\alpha^{2}-\\eta^{2}(d-3)+2\\alpha\\eta]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can be easily seen that there is no scale invariance in such backgrounds .",
    "we will restrict to @xmath41 and @xmath42 without loss of generality , which implies that @xmath8 must diverge to positive infinity at the horizon .    in the specific limit @xmath43 ,",
    "the scalar potential becomes constant and the scale invariance of the solutions can be restored :    * when we set @xmath44 with vanishing flux , the scalar @xmath8 becomes constant and the resulting solution is @xmath30 ; * when we set @xmath45 with flux through @xmath46 , @xmath8 becomes constant and the resulting solution is @xmath47 ; * when we set @xmath48 arbitrary , @xmath25 with flux through @xmath46 , the scalar @xmath49 and the resulting solution is the modified lifshitz solution , whose dynamical exponent @xmath50    before coming to practical calculations we should determine the range of parameters .",
    "firstly , by requiring that @xmath51 for small @xmath28 and the flux to be real , one can impose the bound on @xmath48 in terms of fixed @xmath52 , @xmath53 secondly , when the flux is zero , @xmath54 we should require @xmath55 to ensure a well - defined boundary in the sense of ads / cft , @xmath56 combining constraint derived in the general background in the beginning of this section , we can obtain the following complete restrictions @xmath57 we will impose such constraints in the subsequent calculations",
    ".    the near extremal solution can be obtained in a similar way , @xmath58 where @xmath59 and the other parameters and fields remain the same as the extremal solutions .",
    "one can easily get the temperature @xmath60 and the entropy density @xmath61",
    "in this section we will investigate thermodynamics of massless charge carriers in the backgrounds reviewed in previous section .",
    "according to ads / cft , @xmath62 probe d - branes correspond to @xmath62 fields in the fundamental representation of the gauge group in the probe limit @xmath63  @xcite . an efficient method for evaluating the dc conductivity and dc hall conductivity of probe d - branes was proposed in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a holographic model building approach to `` strange metallic '' phenomenology was initiated in  @xcite , where the bulk spacetime was a lifshitz black hole and the charge carriers were described by d - branes . here",
    "we will consider probe d - branes as massless charge carriers and explore the thermodynamics in the near - extremal background .",
    "the dynamics of probe d - branes is described by the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes the tension of d - branes , @xmath66 is the induced metric and @xmath67 is the @xmath68 field strength on the worldvolume . in the second line we set @xmath69 , where @xmath70 denotes volume of the internal space that the d - branes may be wrapping .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the d - branes are extended along @xmath71 spatial dimensions of the black hole solution . if @xmath72 , the fundamental fields are propagating along certain @xmath10-dimensional defect .",
    "we will introduce a nontrivial worldvolume gauge field @xmath73 and absorb the factor @xmath74 into @xmath67 .",
    "since we are not studying realistic string theories , the wess - zumino terms will be omitted in the following discussions .    before proceeding",
    "we should make sure that the backreaction of the probe branes onto the background can be neglected .",
    "our discussion is along the line of  @xcite . expanding the dbi action to quadric order of @xmath75 in the background ,",
    "we can obtain @xmath76 to avoid backreaction of the probes on the background , the stress energy of the probes must be smaller than that generating the bulk spacetime .",
    "it can be easily seen that the stress energy of the original background@xmath77 , where @xmath78 denotes the planck length in @xmath0-dimensional spacetime and @xmath79 is the corresponding cosmological constant .",
    "therefore by varying the quadric action of the probes with respect to @xmath80 , we can arrive at the following condition @xmath81 one can see that as long as the effective tension @xmath82 is sufficiently small , the backreaction can be neglected .    in this background configuration , after performing the trivial integrations on @xmath83 and dividing out the infinite volume of @xmath84 , we can obtain the action density .",
    "@xmath85 where @xmath86 and the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath28",
    ". then the charge density is given by @xmath87 we can also solve for @xmath88 @xmath89 by plugging in the solution for @xmath88 , we can find the on - shell action density @xmath90    following the methods used in  @xcite , some interesting physical quantities like the chemical potential and the free energy , can be evaluated analytically .",
    "we will see that this is still the case for our background .",
    "the chemical potential is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 notice that in order to obtain the above results , we have made use of the following useful formulae for beta function and incomplete beta function @xmath93 as well as for hypergeometric function @xmath94 after choosing the grand - canonical ensemble , the free energy density is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96    moreover , other thermodynamic quantities can also be calculated from the thermodynamic relations .",
    "the charge density can be written as @xmath97 which is consistent with previous result .",

    "when @xmath100 and @xmath82 is sufficiently small , the first term dominates .",
    "one can easily obtain @xmath103 when the specific heat is proportional to @xmath11 .",

    "note that in this limit , @xmath113 .",
    "so @xmath114 by taking into account of  ( [ res ] ) , we can find that only @xmath115 is permitted .",
    "we can also formally evaluate the `` speed of sound '' . in grand - canonical ensemble ,",
    "the pressure is given by @xmath116 while the energy density is @xmath117 therefore , @xmath118 however , it was emphasized in  @xcite that this quantity is only the speed of normal / first sound in the relativistic case @xmath119 .",

    "we consider thermodynamics of massless probe d - branes in the near - extremal background and clarify the conditions under which the specific heat is linear in the temperature , which is a characteristic feature of fermi liquids .",
    "subsequently we study the zero sound mode by considering the fluctuations of the worldvolume gauge fields on the probe d - branes .",
    "rather than analytically solving the equations of motion , we obtain the low - frequency behavior by solving the equation in two different limits and then matching the two solutions in a regime where the limits overlap , following  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the resulting behavior of the zero sound looks similar to that investigated in  @xcite , that is , when the parameter @xmath258 , the dispersion relation reveals a quasi - particle excitation ; while the zero sound is not a well - defined quasi - particle when @xmath259 .",
    "furthermore , we plot the correlation function in @xmath1 at @xmath217 with fixed parameters which lead to linear specific heat .",
    "the result is that we can not observe any characteristic structure of fermi liquids in a wide range of @xmath17 , which is similar to what was found in  @xcite . as a by - product",
    ", we also evaluate the ac conductivity via the current - current correlation function , which reduces to previously known results at specific limits .    by",
    "now there are mainly two approaches for studying condensed matter physics in the context of holography .",
    "one approach can be thought of as `` top - down '' , that is , we consider certain exact solutions or brane configurations in string / m theory which possess the desired properties of condensed matter systems .",
    "the main advantage is that we have clear understanding about the dual field theories , while it is difficult to find such solutions in string / m theory .",
    "a complementary approach can be seen as `` bottom - up '' , which means that we consider certain toy models of gravity which possess solutions with the desired properties .",
    "it allows a parametrization of large classes of ir dynamics and provides useful information in the dual field theory side .",
    "however , the main disadvantage is that the embeddings of such toy models into string / m theory are not obvious , thus many things in the field theory side remain unknown .",
    "however , the `` bottom - up '' approach is an efficient tool for investigating the ads / cmt correspondence .",
    "the background solutions we studied in this paper are exact solutions of theories with domain wall vacua . in",
    "@xcite the author also constructed interpolates between two exact solutions of the single- exponential , domain wall gravity theory , which lead to the argument that the domain wall / qft correspondence  @xcite can be considered as an effective holographic tool which is applicable in settings beyond the regime of domain wall supergravities .",
    "therefore the domain wall / qft correspondence can also be taken as one specific class of effective holographic theories .",
    "moreover , the author of  @xcite argued that even when the uv completion of some bulk theory was unknown , if the theory admitted an approximate domain wall solution at some intermediate value of @xmath28 then one could use domain wall / qft correspondence to develop a holographic map .",
    "thus it is interesting to develop the ads / cmt holography by making use of this domain wall / qft correspondence . in particular",
    ", we can establish precision holography in this anisotropic background along the line of  @xcite and study the fermionic correlation functions following  @xcite .",
    "we leave such fascinating projects in the future .",
