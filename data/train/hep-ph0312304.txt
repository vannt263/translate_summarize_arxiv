    "the determination of flavour singlet and non - singlet axial vector matrix elements between nucleon states is of considerable interest theoretically and experimentally .",
    "while non - singlet currents appear in nucleon and hyperon beta decays , the linear combination @xmath6 appears in the integral of the first moment of the polarised structure function @xmath7 in the sumrule of bjorken @xcite . here",
    "@xmath8 denotes proton state of momentum @xmath9 and polarisation @xmath10 .",
    "we have introduced the constant @xmath11 to denote the linear combination of axial vector current with coefficients equal to square of quark charges .",
    "nearly three decades ago ellis and jaffe @xcite using a simple minded application of the ozi rule , set the strange quark current matrix element between proton states to be zero , which immediately enabled them to write @xmath12 where , @xmath13 is the isovector axial vector coupling occuring in nucleon beta decay and @xmath14 is the octet current coupling .",
    "eqn.([gbj ] ) is in disagreement with experiment @xcite if su(3 ) flavor symmetry is a good symmetry @xcite . already in 1979",
    "gross , trieman and wilczek @xcite had pointed out that because the light quark masses are unequal , i.e. @xmath15 one should expect large violations of isospin symmetry in the bjorken sumrule if anomaly is neglected .",
    "the matrix elements of the anomaly between vacuum and goldstone states @xmath16 and @xmath17 are not zero and play a crucial role in maintaining flavour symmetry .",
    "as we shall discuss further in section [ two ] , this at once implies that ellis - jaffe assumptions of simulataneous validity of su(3 ) flavour symmetry and ozi rule are mutually incompatible .",
    "the octet current has no anomaly while the singlet does .",
    "the computation of matrix elements of the axial current in eqn.([bj ] ) is clearly a problem in qcd .",
    "this can be addressed using the external field method introduced in the context of qcd sumrules by ioffe and smilga @xcite and balitsky and yung @xcite in 1983 to calculate the magnetic moments and which has since then been used for numerous other matrix elements as well .",
    "in fact computation of the axial vector current matrix elements has been done using these methods in ref.@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the reasons for reconsidering the earlier qcd sum rule determination of @xmath18 are as follows .    1 .",
    "besides the usual lorentz invariant chiral and gluon condensates present in qcd vacuum , additional non - invariant correlators @xmath19 induced by the external field , enter the sumrules . if in eqn.(1 ) , on the left hand side , we had only flavour non - singlet currents , the corresponding external field induced correlator of dimension three , @xmath20 for example , can be found using the ward identity and pcac .",
    "+ the determination of either the isoscalar current or su(3 ) singlet current correlators @xmath21 with the help of ward identities are no longer simple since they involve the gluon anomaly . in earlier works",
    "some authors @xcite used simply the values of the non - singlet current induced correlators , as an expedient measure , while ioffe and khodjamirian @xcite found inconsistencies with su(3 ) flavor symmetry in their calculations of the correlator in eqn.(6 ) . indeed later in ref.@xcite , the correlator eqn.(6 ) was treated as an unknown free parameter and its value fixed by using the experimental value of @xmath18 . in the present work we follow a different procedure .",
    "the external field induced correlator corresponding to the isoscalar current eqn.(5 ) is determined directly from the axial vector meson spectrum and we verify that similar determination of the nonsinglet isovector current induced correlator eqn.(3 ) indeed yields a value consistent with ward identity and pcac .",
    "we also clarify the differences in the calculations of the wilson coefficients between ref.@xcite and @xcite on one hand and ref .",
    "@xcite on the other .",
    "3 .   in the analysis of sumrules",
    ", we use a value of the qcd scale parameter @xmath22 consistent with present data , while earlier works used a significantly lower value .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in the next section we briefly recapitulate the arguments of gross , treiman and wilczek , regarding the role of the anomaly in maintaining the flavour symmetry .",
    "although the anomaly is superficially a flavor singlet its matrix elements between the vacuum and the goldstone state @xmath23 and @xmath17 , are not zero .",
    "we also make a brief digression on the ozi rule . in section",
    "[ three ] we give a summary of the external field method , and an appendix explains the differences between ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite in the computation of the wilson coefficients . in section",
    "[ four ] we outline the determination of the external field induced vacuum correlators which is used in section [ five ] to determine the isoscalar matrix element and we end with a brief discussion .",
    "we briefly recall the argument of ref @xcite .",
    "if we ignore the anomaly then we have , for the divergence of isoscalar current @xmath24&=&i(m_u+m_d)\\left [ \\bar{u}\\gamma_5 u + \\bar{d}\\gamma_5 d \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\   & + & i(m_u - m_d)\\left[\\bar{u}\\gamma_5 u - \\bar{d}\\gamma_5 d \\right]\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we also have , for the isovector @xmath25\\nonumber\\\\ & = & i(m_u+m_d)\\left [ \\bar{u}\\gamma_5 u - \\bar{d}\\gamma_5 d\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & + & i(m_u - m_d)\\left [ \\bar{u}\\gamma_5 u + \\bar{d}\\gamma_5 d \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] combining these using pcac one gets @xmath26 where the subscript @xmath27 on the nucleon states denotes the difference between proton and neutron matrix elements @xmath28 eqn.([pcac ] ) implies a large violation of isospin in bjorken sum - rule since @xmath29 this conclusion is avoided by noting that one has ignored the anomaly . in eqn.(7 ) one should write @xmath24&=&i(m_u+m_d)\\left [ \\bar{u}\\gamma_5 u + \\bar{d}\\gamma_5 d \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & + & i(m_u - m_d)\\left[\\bar{u}\\gamma_5 u - \\bar{d}\\gamma_5 d \\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & + & 2\\frac{g^2}{16\\pi^2}g_{\\mu\\nu}^a\\tilde{g}_{\\mu\\nu}^a\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 . using a sutherland type argument",
    "it is derived in ref @xcite @xmath31 and @xmath32 where , @xmath33 etc .",
    "using again a pcac argument they@xcite obtain @xmath34 in other words the matrix elements of the anomaly are far from being a flavour singlet .",
    "it was pointed out by novikov et.al @xcite that the matrix elements of the anomaly between vacuum and @xmath17 is again not zero .",
    "writing @xmath35 and taking its diveregence one gets @xmath36 where we have ignored @xmath37 and @xmath38 in comparison with @xmath39 . for the singlet current one may write @xmath40 if su(3 ) flavour symmetry were exact , as happens when all light quark masses are neglected , @xmath41 . on",
    "the other hand @xmath42 remains finite in the chiral limit of massless quarks .",
    "we can expect then @xmath43 .",
    "setting @xmath41 , it is then easy to obtain from eqns .",
    "( 15 ) and ( 16 ) cf.@xcite , @xmath44 we learn from eqns.([ud ] ) and ( [ gg ] ) above that the matrix elements of the anomaly between the vacuum and non - singlet goldston boson @xmath23 and @xmath17 is not zero but proportional to quark mass differences .",
    "we note that ioffe and shifman @xcite using eqns .",
    "( [ ud ] ) and ( [ gg ] ) above obtained the result @xmath45 experimentally one has @xmath46 .",
    "we use this to find @xmath47 and obtain @xmath48 which is consistent with values obtained using entirely different inputs ; gao @xcite @xmath49 and leutwyler @xcite @xmath50 .    encouraged by the agreement between eqn.([gg ] ) and experiments let us consider the matrix element @xmath51 taking the divergence @xmath52 using eqns.([ss ] ) and ( [ gg ] ) we have @xmath53 now it is known that the goldberger - treiman relation @xmath54 is accurate to a few percent and is exact in the chiral limit of massless quarks .",
    "corrections to it have the structure @xcite @xmath55 in other words , gt relation is obtained by retaining only the goldstone pole and discarding the continuum contribution in the dispersion integrands . in the chiral limit , equations analogous to eqns.([gt ] ) and ( 23 ) also hold good for the nucleon matrix element of the octet current with @xmath13 replaced by @xmath56 and @xmath57 replaced by @xmath58 etc . with leading corrections proportional to quark mass as in eqn([dgt ] ) . if we now naively extend these dispersion relation considerations to the nucleon matrix element of the strange quark current @xmath59 , retaining only the @xmath60-pole and discard the continuum as well as @xmath61 pole we immediately obtain from eqn.(14 ) , ( 19 ) and ( [ fsfp ] ) @xmath62 or @xmath63 which is same as the skyrme model result @xcite .",
    "our main point in this section is that ozi can not be applied naively .",
    "the anomaly is important to avoid gross violations of su(3 ) flavour symmetry and matrix elements of the anomaly are not flavour symmetric .",
    "it is worth emphasising that ozi rule violates unitarity , a cardinal property of all s - matrix elements .",
    "corrections to ozi rule can be estimated using unitarity and they are very much process dependent @xcite .",
    "charmonium decays illustrate the point .",
    "for example , @xmath64 despite the fact @xmath65 kev is just a factor of three larger than @xmath66 kev . again in the decay of @xmath67 into light mesons , su(3 ) flavor symmetry works better in pseudoscalar vector decays than in vector tensor decays .",
    "also the decay mode @xmath68 is not doubly suppressed as one might naively expect .",
    "these emphasise the point that corrections to ozi rule are to be studied individually for each matrix element @xcite and there is no universal principle which tells a priori how good is the ozi rule for any specific matrix element .",
    "we shall follow closely the notations of ioffe @xcite .",
    "we consider the nucleon correlator in an external field @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the nucleon current @xmath71 with proton quantum numbers ; @xmath72 are quark fields and @xmath73 are color indices .",
    "@xmath74 refers to constant external field . to compute the matrix element of the current @xmath75 between a proton state @xmath76 one",
    "adds a term @xmath77 to the lagrangian and evaluates @xmath78 in eqn.([pia ] ) upto terms linear in @xmath74 . in ref",
    "@xcite-@xcite the following four different currents were considered .",
    "@xmath79 bearing in mind that the corrections to ozi rule are a priori unknown and can be large , we shall consider only the isoscalar current eqn.(30 ) here , since the nucleon current of ioffe in eqns.(26 - 27 ) above has only up and down quark fields , and therefore couples to the @xmath80 term in the octet current , eqn.(31 ) , or singlet , eqn.(32),only through gluonic corrections that is by corrections to ozi rule .    in deriving the qcd",
    "sumrules one must take into account , external field induced correlators .",
    "we define @xmath81 it is clear that the constants @xmath82 and @xmath83 are in general different corresponding to the different @xmath84 introduced in eq.(28 - 32 ) .",
    "the constant @xmath82 can be obtained from @xmath85 and the constant @xmath83 from @xmath86 complete details of the calculation of @xmath78 in eqn.([pia ] ) can be found in ref.@xcite for both the isovector and isoscalar currents .",
    "for the isoscalar axial vector matrix element the sum rule then reads @xmath87 \\label{rule}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath88 is the nucleon mass and @xmath89 is the borel mass variable . in the right hand side , @xmath90 is defined by @xmath91 @xmath92 is the isoscalar axial vector current matrix element .",
    "the term @xmath93 arises from the fact that in the presence of external field there are non - diagonal transition between nucleon and excited states . in the left hand side @xmath94 @xmath95",
    "is the renormalization scale , which we take to be 1 gev , and @xmath22 is the qcd scale which for 3 flavor case is 247 mev . with one loop beta function with three flavors . ]",
    "although the sum rule has been written down earlier by several authors the purpose of reconsidering it here are the following .    1 .",
    "it is clear the constants @xmath82 and @xmath83 should be determined from other sumrules or different considerations before we can use it to find @xmath96 in eqn.(37 ) .",
    "as will be explained in detail in the next section , for the isovector case , it is relatively easy to determine them using pcac . for the singlet currents one must take into account the anomaly .",
    "a decade ago ioffe and khodjamirian @xcite attempted to compute @xmath82 using the ward identity and sum rules for the divergence of the su(3 ) singlet current .",
    "they found inconsistency with su(3 ) flavour symmetry chiefly because of the large difference between the strange quark mass and the up or down quark mass . in",
    "later works @xcite this lead ioffe and his collaborators to use the sumrule , eqn.(37 ) , to find @xmath82 using the experimental value of @xmath18 in eqn.(1 ) .",
    "in contrast here for the isoscalar matrix element we shall determine the constant @xmath82 from the spectrum of isoscalar axial vector mesons , and use that value to determine from eqn.(37 ) the value of @xmath96 and therefore @xmath18 .",
    "2 .   the external field lagrangian , modifies the propagation of the current @xmath70 , in the qcd vacuum in two ways .",
    "one in which the external field directly couples to the fields in @xmath70 . the other , in which the external field modifies the vacuum as represented by the induced correlators @xmath82 and @xmath83 , which appear in the second and fourth terms in the sum rule , eqn.(37 ) .",
    "now consider the difference between the three @xmath84 in eqns.(30 ) , ( 31 ) , and ( 32 ) .",
    "as long as gluon loops are not included , the additional term @xmath97 will not couple to the @xmath98 and @xmath99 fields in @xmath70 .",
    "the strange quark term will only affect the constants @xmath82 and @xmath83 in eqn.(35 ) and ( 36 ) .",
    "putting it differently with this assumption , the same sum rule , eqn.(37 ) , is valid for all the three currents , eqn.(30)-(32 ) namely , the isoscalar , octet and su(3 ) singlet with only the external field induced correlators @xmath82 and @xmath83 being different .",
    "correspondingly if we were to compute only the matrix element of @xmath100 then we would consider , in place of eqn.(28 ) , the external field lagrangian @xmath101 and the corresponding sum rule for the strange quark matrix element in eqn.(37 ) will have , in its left hand side , only the second and fourth terms due to modifications of the vacuum and all other terms will be set to zero . in the light of our discussion of ozi rule , one may then expect that the sum rule eqn.(37 ) will work better for the isoscalar matrix element than for the octet or su(3 ) singlet .",
    "3 .   the sum rule , eqn.(37 ) , differs from those of ref.@xcite also in the coefficient of the third and fourth terms due to difference in the calculation of wilson coefficients .",
    "this point is elaborated in the appendix .",
    "we now turn to the computation of the constants @xmath82 and @xmath83 defined in eqns.(33 - 36 ) .",
    "first consider the isovector case with the current defined in eqn.(29 ) and the corresponding correlator @xmath102 one can write @xmath103 where the coefficient of @xmath104 , @xmath105 , gets contribution only from spin @xmath106 states while the coefficient of @xmath107 , @xmath108 , has contributions form both @xmath106 and @xmath109 states .",
    "it is easy to see , using the gauge condition , @xmath110 and eqns.(28 ) , ( 32 ) and ( 34 ) that @xmath111 this can be easily evaluated using the ward - identity which reads @xmath112 isolating the pion pole in @xmath113 and pseudoscalar correlation matrix element in the r.h.s .",
    "we can write near the pion pole @xmath114 from which we get @xmath115 for the isoscalar case we need to consider the analogue eqn(38 ) @xmath116 with @xmath117 however , unlike the isovector case the ward identities are no longer simple since it involves anomaly eqn.(10 ) and eqn.(40 ) is replaced , in the right hand side , by considerably more complex set of terms including the anomaly .",
    "we shall therefore not use the ward identity to find @xmath118 .    on the other hand @xmath119",
    "satisfies a dispersion relation . using the operator product expansion for @xmath119 the value of @xmath118 can be found by the qcd sum rule method .",
    "analogous procedure of course can be used for the isovector case as well .",
    "this procedure is well known and complete details can be found in ref.@xcite .",

    "we like to stress that the above calculation does not use ward identity and pcac .",

    "we can proceed in an analogous manner as for the isovector case above .",
    "first we note that in the physical side or the r.h.s . of the sum rules , eqns.(46 ) and",
    "( 48 ) , @xmath149 will replace @xmath126 .",
    "the higher mass state @xmath150 is effectively included in the sum over higher mass states which in the usual qcd sumrule approach are represented by the quark loop contributions with an effective threshold @xmath151 .",
    "we should stress here that the details of the decay modes of @xmath149 and @xmath150 are irrelevant and do not enter the sum rules .    now turning to the ope it is clear , from eqn.(38 ) and eqn.(43 ) ,",
    "that as long as quark anihilation diagrams are neglected the ope for @xmath27 and @xmath146 currents will be identical .",
    "consider the first term in eqn.(49 ) .",
    "this arises from the single quark loop and is the same for the isovector and isoscalar case .",
    "however in the isoscalar case we must include corrections that can arise from a three loop diagram in which the initial quark current loop annihilates to a two gluon intermediate followed by materialisation to the final current quark loop .",

    "however for the isoscalar current , for which @xmath213 , the results are different . ref . @xcite have @xmath214 reversing the sign of fig ( 6 ) gives @xmath215 which is result of ref.@xcite .",
    "thus ref.@xcite and @xcite agree numerically in the case @xmath216 but different in the isoscalar case . in eqn.(37 )",
    "the coeffcient used corresponds to eqn.([a1 ] ) .",
    "we now turn to the coefficient of the gluon condensate @xmath217 .",
    "again details of the calculations are given in ref.@xcite in their table 1 which uses their eqn(2.12 ) and fig.2 which leads to coefficient @xmath218 .",
    "on the other hand ref.@xcite seem to have @xmath219 for this coefficient .",
    "thus ref.@xcite and @xcite agree numerically in the case @xmath216 but have opposite signs in the isoscalar case .",
    "interestingly enough if one tries to obtain the wilson coefficients for @xmath220 by using a chiral rotation of the quark fields given by @xmath221 in the propagator @xmath222 in absence of the external field , which occurs in the mass sum rule and assuming the validity of chiral invariance of the vacuum to obtain @xmath223 one obtains @xmath219 for the coefficient of @xmath224 . on the other hand",
    "it is well recognised that presence of non - perturbative gluon fileds in the vacuum state leads to breakdown of chiral symmetry , which would seem to invalidate such a calculation . again in eqn.(37 ) we have used the result @xmath218 found in ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite .",
    "fortuitiously enough these two differences in the coefficients of third and fourth terms in eqn.(37 ) between ref.@xcite and @xcite numerically tend to compensate .",
    "also we have seen the dimension three term characterised by @xmath82 which occures with @xmath225 in eqn.(37 ) , is far more significant than the @xmath89 term in obtaining @xmath226 .",
    "our main point has been that @xmath82 can be computed from the spectrum of axial mesons and we get a sensible answer for @xmath165 and therefore @xmath18 .",
