    "understanding how galaxies form is one of the most challenging open problems in cosmology .",
    "elliptical ( e ) galaxies are the simplest ones and those that show the most precise regularities in their measured properties , with their stellar central l.o.s.velocity dispersions , @xmath5 ( a mass indicator ) , strongly correlated with many other of their properties including luminosities , sizes , colors and index - line strengths , as recently confirmed by the sloan digital sky survey sdss @xcite    the age distribution of stellar populations in e galaxies is one of the key pieces in the puzzle of the origins and evolution of galaxies .",
    "it was conventionally thought that these populations are coeval systems , formed as the result of a unique burst of star formation ( sfb ) at very high @xmath1 .",
    "recently , spectral indices have been identified ( h@xmath9 , h@xmath10 , h@xmath11 ) that break the age - metallicity degeneracy , allowing for an improved stellar age determination in e galaxies through evolutionary synthesis models ( see review in * ? ? ?",
    "even if still hampered by uncertainties , these models point now to more massive es having older mean ages ( mas ) and lower rates of recent star formation and , also , higher suprasolar @xmath6/@xmath7fe@xmath8 ratios than less massive ones ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the high @xmath6/@xmath7fe@xmath8 ratios are actually depressed iron abundances at higher @xmath5 , rather than @xmath12 element enhancements @xcite , so that the @xmath6/@xmath7fe@xmath8 ratios are a good measure of the timescale for stellar formation @xcite .",
    "the values of these ratios and their correlation with mass indicators suggest that an important fraction of the stars in most e galaxies formed on short timescales , and that this fraction increases with @xmath5 .",
    "these trends have been confirmed by @xcite in their analyses of the sdss sample of e galaxies , containing to date 9000 galaxies from different environments .",
    "@xcite reach similar conclusions on the stellar mass - age correlation through a novel statistical analysis of @xmath13 galaxies from sdss dr1 .",
    "two views have historically existed on how es formed .",
    "the modern version of the classical _ monolithic collapse scenario _ puts the stress on e assembly out of gaseous material ( that is , with dissipation ) , either in the form of a unique cloud or of many gaseous clumps , but not out of pre - existing stars , with the stellar populations forming at high @xmath1 and on short timescales relative to spirals @xcite . the competing _ hierarchical scenario _ ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) propounds that galaxies form hierarchically through successive non - dissipative , random mergers of subunits ( the so - called galaxy merger tree ) over a wide redshift range , in such a way that more massive ones ( that is , es ) form more likely at late time .",
    "the age determinations and the interpretation of the @xmath6/@xmath7fe@xmath8 ratios outlined above , as well as their correlations with mass indicators , favor the monolithic collapse scenario .",
    "in fact , the hierarchical scenario tends to predict younger mas and larger spreads in the stellar age distributions of more massive es @xcite , see @xcite and @xcite for details and discussions .",
    "but the monolithic collapse scenario does not recover all the currently available observations on es either .",
    "such are , for example , the wide range in ages their stellar populations span in some cases or their kinematical and dynamical peculiarities @xcite , indicating that an important fraction of present - day es have recently experienced merger events .",
    "a very convenient approach to reconcile all the current observational background on es within a formation scenario , is to study galaxy assembly from simple physical principles and in connection with the global cosmological model through self - consistent gravo - hydrodynamical simulations @xcite .",
    "individual galaxy - like objects ( glos ) naturally appear as an output of these simulations , only star formation processes need further modelling .",
    "these simulations directly provide the phase space structure and the stellar age distribution of each individual glo at each @xmath1 , so that the stellar formation rate history of each glo can be determined .",
    "this reverses the observational situation where spectral information is available and stellar age distributions must be determined through modelling .",
    "also , the structural and dynamical parameters characterizing each glo can be estimated .",
    "the first step in the program of studying the origins of e galaxies through self - consistent simulations , is to make sure that they produce elliptical - like object ( elo ) samples that have counterparts in the real local universe as far as structure and dynamics is concerned ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sds04 ) .",
    "the second step is to show that elo stellar populations have age distributions with the same trends as those inferred from observations and to try to understand how these trends arise .",
    "these are the issues addressed in this letter .",
    "we have run four hydrodynamical simulations ( namely , s14 , s16 , s17 and s26 ) in the context of a concordance cosmological model , in which the normalization parameter has been taken slightly high , @xmath14 , as compared with the average fluctuations of 2dfgrs or sdss galaxies @xcite to mimic an active region of the universe @xcite .",
    "galaxy - like objects of different morphologies form in these simulations .",
    "elos have been identified as those objects having a prominent stellar spheroidal component with hardly disks at all .",
    "it turns out that the 8 more massive objects identified at @xmath0 in s14 , s16 and s17 , and the 4 more massive in s26 , fulfill this condition .",
    "we report here on age effects in the stellar populations of this elo sample .",
    "this is the same sample whose structural and kinematical properties have been analyzed in sds04 , and found to be consistent with sdss data @xcite for the s16 and s17 subsamples .",
    "we refer the reader to sds04 for details on the sample general properties and to @xcite for the simulation technique .",
    "star formation ( sf ) processes have been included through a simple parameterization , similar to that first used by @xcite , that transforms cold locally - collapsing gas at kpc scales , denser than a threshold density , @xmath15 , into stars at a rate @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a characteristic time - scale chosen to be equal to the maximum of the local gas - dynamical time , @xmath18 , and the local cooling time ; @xmath19 is the average star formation efficiency at kpc scales , i.e. , the empirical kennicutt - schmidt law @xcite . to test the effects of sf parameterization , s14 , s16 , and s26 share the same initial conditions and they differ only in the sf parameters ( @xmath20 = 0.1 , 0.03 and 0.01 , and @xmath21 = @xmath22 g @xmath23 for s14 , s16 and s26 , respectively , that is , sf becomes increasingly more difficult from s14 to s26 ) . to test cosmic variance , s17 is identical to s16 , except that their initial conditions differ .",
    "supernova feedback effects or energy inputs other than gravitational have not been _ explicitly _ included in these simulations .",
    "the role of discrete stellar energy sources at the scales resolved in this work is not yet clear .",
    "in fact , in the context of the new sequential multi - scale sf scenarios ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , some authors argue that stellar energy releases drive the structure of the ism only locally at subkiloparsec scales .",
    "also , recent mhd simulations of self - regulating snii heating in the ism at scales @xmath7 250 pc @xcite , indicate that this process produces a kennicutt - schmidt - like law on average ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if this were the case , the kennicutt - schmidt law implemented in our code would already _ implicitly _ account for the effects stellar processes have on the scales our code resolves as far as sf rates is concerned , so that our ignorance on subkiloparsec scale stellar processes relative to sf ( not to metal production or diffusion ) rates would be contained in the particular values @xmath15 and @xmath19 take .",
    "we now briefly comment on the physics of elo assembly as found in these simulations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the highly non - linear stages of gravitational instability can be described in terms of the adhesion model @xcite , based on burgers equation @xcite , whose solutions exhibit time and space scale invariance in a statistical sense in terms of the so - called _ coalescence length _ , @xmath24 , that grows as time elapses , defining the average scale of coalescence in the system .",
    "evolution first leads to the formation of a cellular structure that is quasi self - similar and not homogeneous , as @xmath24 depends on the particular region @xmath25 within the simulation box considered ( and , consequently , hereafter it will be written as @xmath26 ) . at a given scale ,",
    "overdense regions first expand slower than average , then they turn around and collapse through fast global compressions , involving the cellular structure elements they enclose and in particular nodes connected by filaments , that experience fast head - on fusions . for the massive elos in the sample this happens between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "these overdense regions act as _ flow convergence regions _ ( fcrs hereafter ) , whose baryon content defines the particles that will end up in a bound configuration forming an elo at lower @xmath1 .",
    "fcrs contain a hierarchy of attraction basins toward which a fraction of the matter flows feeding the clumps they host .",
    "another fraction of the matter keeps diffuse .",
    "the transformation of gas particles into stars at high @xmath1 mainly occurs through the multiclump collapse ensuing turn around , that takes the clumps closer and closer along filaments causing them to merge at very low relative angular momentum and , consequently , without orbital delay .",
    "this results into strong and very fast sfbs at high @xmath1 that transform most of the available gas in the clumps into stars , the exact fraction depending on the values of @xmath26 at the fcr and of the sf parameters .",
    "the frequency of head - on mergers decreases after elo global collapse , notwithstanding that at low @xmath1 mass assembly occurs mainly through merger events .",
    "in fact , many elos in our sample have experienced at least one major merger event at @xmath291 , but a strong sfb occurs only if enough gas is still available after the intense thermo - hydrodynamical activity epoch at high @xmath1 .",
    "so , our simulations confirm the triggering of sfbs by different dynamical events , either at high @xmath1 ( flow singularity formation ) or lower @xmath1 ( mainly merger or interaction events * ? ? ?",
    "the simulations also show that diffuse gas is heated and expelled at violent events involving massive objects , and that a fraction of it is lost to the elo potential well .",
    "it forms an x - ray emitting corona whose mass content is similar to the stellar mass content bound to massive elos ( that is , a @xmath30 % of the initial gaseous mass ) .",
    "figure  [ sfdif ] illustrates the star formation rate history ( sfrh ) of a typical massive elo in the sample ( stellar mass @xmath31 at @xmath0 ) .",
    "note that at high @xmath1 this sfrh is the sum of many sfbs occurring very close in time . comparing this sfrh with a detailed history of the elo assembly ,",
    "it has been found out that in fact the peaks correspond to sfbs in different gaseous clumps toward which baryons that form the object at @xmath0 flow at early times ; these clumps merge causing or increasing the intensity of their sfbs , whose width is always narrow .",
    "note that the baryon content of individual clumps in an elo fcr is not mixed up before global elo collapse .",
    "once collapse is over when the universe age was @xmath32 ( @xmath33 in this case ) , further sf occurs through random interaction or merger events .",
    "an important parameter is then the mass ratio @xmath34 , giving the fraction of the elo total stellar mass at @xmath35 , @xmath36 , formed at high @xmath1 in the elo collapse event .",
    "we have found that it increases with the elo total mass at the halo scale , @xmath2 , or put in other words , at fixed @xmath15 and @xmath19 , the fraction of gas at the fcr that is transformed into stars at collapse event increases with @xmath3 , leaving a lower gas fraction available to form stars at lower @xmath1 . at @xmath0",
    "the cold gas fraction relative to stars inside elos is @xmath37 2% to 8% , depending on their mass .",
    "another important point illustrated by figure  [ sfdif ] is that most sfbs at @xmath38 are triggered by minor mergers with small gas rich clumps , and not necessarily by major merger events , that , nevertheless are very relevant in elo mass assembly .",
    "in fact , the elo in figure  [ sfdif ] experienced a major merger ( mass ratio @xmath39 ) at @xmath40 or @xmath41 and , however , no important sfb is apparent in its sfrh , because in this case negligible amounts of gas bound to the merging elos are available to form stars .",
    "we have found that major mergers of this kind , that is , involving very gas poor objects , become less frequent as @xmath1 grows , and , in a given @xmath1 range , as @xmath3 decreases .",
    "we have also found that more massive elos not only form more stars ( an issue already analyzed in sds04 ) , but they also form the bulk of their stars earlier on and through stronger sbs than less massive ones .",
    "a consequence is that the age distribution of stellar populations changes with elo mass .",
    "to quantify these differences , the percentiles of elo stellar age distributions have been calculated . for each elo in the sample",
    ", we have calculated the redshifts , @xmath42 , and the universe ages , @xmath43 , at which the fraction @xmath44 of the stellar mass at @xmath0 , @xmath36 , was already formed .",
    "the percentiles at @xmath45 can be taken for a measure of the amount of low @xmath1 star formation ; the difference @xmath46 as an estimation of the _ global _ width or timescale for elo star formation ; @xmath47 is an estimation of the ma of the population . for any @xmath44",
    "a trend exists with @xmath3 .",
    "the observational age effects with @xmath5 arise because @xmath3 and @xmath5 are on their turn tightly correlated ( we have found for the elo sample @xmath48 ) , so that @xmath5 is an empirical virial mass estimator , see @xcite ; siz et al .",
    "( in preparation )",
    ". moreover , @xmath49 and the elo stellar mass content @xmath36 are also closely correlated ( see details in sds04 ) , so that a trend of @xmath43 and @xmath42 with @xmath36 also exists . as an illustration of these trends , in figure  [ percent ] we plot @xmath47 and @xmath50 versus @xmath5 for the elo sample .",
    "we see that more massive elos have older mas and narrower spreads in the distributions of their stellar populations .",
    "figure  [ percent]a compares adequately well with _",
    "ma determinations through population synthesis modelling for es in different @xmath5 bins . for example , for the isophotal populations in the e sample from (",
    "* their tables 1 and 9 ) , the ma averages for es with @xmath51 in the ranges ( 260 - 158 ) and ( 158 - 100 ) km s@xmath52 differ in @xmath53t@xmath54 , consistent with that found for the global populations of the elo sample.t@xmath54 for the central stellar populations of the gonzlez ( 1993 ) e sample . ]",
    "figure  [ percent]b shows that width determinations from @xmath6/@xmath7fe@xmath8 ratios are consistent with elo widths except for the most massive ones , at , say , @xmath55 km s@xmath52 ( crosses in figure  [ percent]b are from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 6 ) , maybe because the most massive elos have been dynamically shaped at low @xmath1 through major merger events involving smaller elos of @xmath37 half their final mass , so that the stellar populations of these massive elos at @xmath0 reflect the properties of the stellar populations corresponding to the smaller merging elos .",
    "note that the trends in figures  [ percent ] appear in subsamples with very different sf parameterizations , so that the trends are independent of the particular details of the sf implementation .",
    "the simulations we report on in this letter not only show that elo stellar populations have age distributions with the same trends as those inferred from observations , but they also provide us with clues on how these trends arise .",
    "they indicate that elos are assembled out of the mass elements that at high @xmath1 are enclosed by those overdense regions @xmath25 whose local coalescence length @xmath26 grows much faster than average and whose mass scale ( total mass enclosed by @xmath25 , @xmath56 ) is of the order of an e galaxy total ( i.e. , including its halo ) mass .",
    "the virial mass of the elo at low @xmath1 , @xmath3 , is the sum of the masses of the particles that belong to @xmath25 and are involved into the elo merger tree .",
    "note that this sum is determined by the local realization of the initial power spectrum of density fluctuations at @xmath25 , that , on its turn , also determines the total energy of the particles in the elo , @xmath57 ( observationally seen as velocity dispersion @xmath5 ) , and the growth rate of @xmath58 . as a consequence , when @xmath26 grows faster , @xmath2 and @xmath57 are higher ( see also siz et al .",
    ", in preparation , and references quoted therein ) .",
    "now , when @xmath26 grows faster than average at a given region @xmath25 , the local time unit at @xmath25 is shorter than at other @xmath59s where it grows slower .",
    "and so , the thermo - hydrodynamical activity at high @xmath1 at @xmath25 is more intense than at other @xmath59s and , in particular more stars form and gas becomes exhausted earlier on , making it difficult further star formation at low @xmath1 merger events .",
    "this is how the intrinsic correlations age distribution - @xmath3 - @xmath57 arise in an elo sample , whose observational counterpart are likely the age distribution - @xmath5 correlations shown by elliptical samples , as discussed in @xmath60[intro ] and @xmath60[simu ] .",
    "the simulations we analyze also suggest that a fraction of the stars in e galaxies could have been formed at lower redshifts .",
    "a related interesting point is the possibility that mass assembly and dynamical shaping at low @xmath1 is not necessarily accompanied by strong sfb activity .",
    "for example , the two more massive elos in s14 and s16 , or the most massive in s17 , have been structurally and dynamically shaped at a low @xmath1 ( @xmath61 and 0.65 , respectively ) , however only very modest starbursts resulted from these dynamically very violent events , because of gas consumption at high @xmath1 .",
    "some interpretations of the hierarchical clustering paradigm consider that the @xmath62fe@xmath63 $ ] - @xmath49 correlation is not consistent with this paradigm .",
    "the results reported in this letter indicate that they are indeed , provided that the bulk of the stellar populations forming elos have been formed in different subunits at high @xmath1 and merged together very soon after ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this letter",
    "we show that this fast clumpy collapse follows from simple physical principles in the context of the current @xmath64cdm scenario .",
