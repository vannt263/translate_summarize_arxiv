    "enough is understood about the dynamics of the components of a standard ( non - magnetar , non - strange ) neutron star ( ns ) to support what should be a reliable description of what happens within a spinning magnetized ns as it ages and spins down or , in rarer cases , when it is spun up .    in a cool core below the crust of a spinning ns",
    "superconducting protons coexist with more abundant superfluid neutrons ( sf - n ) to form a giant atomic nucleus which contains within it a neutralizing sea of relativistic degenerate electrons .",
    "the neutrons rotate with a spin - period @xmath0 ( sec ) @xmath1 only by forming a nearly uniform array of corotating quantized vortex lines parallel to the spin axis , with an area density @xmath2",
    ". the array must contract ( expand ) when the ns spins up ( down ) .",
    "in stellar core neutron spin - up or spin - down , a vortex a distance @xmath3 from the spin - axis generally moves outward with a velocity @xmath4 until @xmath3 reaches the core s neutron superfluid radius ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "any stellar magnetic field passing below the stellar crust must , in order to penetrate through the core s superconducting protons ( sc - p ) , become a very dense array of quantized flux - tubes ( @xmath6 with @xmath7 the local average magnetic field ) . each tube carries a flux @xmath8 and a magnetic field @xmath9 .",
    "several @xmath10 , and @xmath11 in between@xcite , the impact on surface @xmath7 of changing ns spin proposed below would not change significantly .",
    "if , however , @xmath12 , the locally averaged @xmath7 inside the ns core exceeds a critical field somewhat greater than @xmath10 , the core s protons would not become superconducting",
    ". this may well be the case for most ( or all ) `` magnetars''@xcite . ]        the initial magnetic field within the core of a neutron star is expected to have both toroidal and very non - uniform poloidal components .",
    "the web of flux - tubes formed after the transition to superconductivity is then much more complicated and irregular than the neutron vortex - array as well as of order @xmath13 times more dense . because of the velocity dependence of the short range nuclear force between neutrons and protons",
    ", there is a strong interaction between the neutron - superfluid s vortex - lines and the proton - superconductor s flux - tubes if they come closer to each other than about @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , when @xmath15 flux tubes will be pushed ( or pulled ) by the moving neutron vortices@xcite . a realistic flux - tube array will be forced to move along with a changing sf - n vortex array which threads it as long as the force at a vortex - line flux - tube juncture does not grow so large that vortex lines cut through flux - tubes .",
    "the drag on moving flux - tube arrays from their small average velocities ( @xmath16 ) in spinning - down pulsars , cool ( old ) enough to have sf - n cores , seems far too small to cause such cut - through .",
    "the main quantitative uncertainty in the model described below is the maximum sustainable shear - strain ( @xmath17 ? ) on the conducting crust , which anchors core flux - tubes ( cf .",
    "fig 1 ) , before the crust yield - strength is exceeded .",
    "an estimate@xcite for that maximum sustainable crustal shear - stress , compared to that from the @xmath18 of the core s flux - tube array , supports a ns model in which the crust yields before the core s flux - tubes are cut through by its moving sf - n vortex array , as long as @xmath19 . even for much smaller",
    "@xmath20 , flux - tube anchoring by the conducting crust would result in such cut - through only when the ns s spin - down age ( @xmath21 ) exceeds the crust s eddy current dissipation time ( @xmath22 yrs . ) . then in most observationally relevant regimes the motion of the magnetic flux - tube array near the top of the ns core ( and @xmath7 at the crust surface above it ) follows that of the sf - n vortex array which threads it .",
    "this forms the basis of a very simple model for describing predicted changes in pulsar magnetic fields during ns spin - up or spin - down which agrees well with a variety of different families of pulsar observations .",
    "ns spin - up , when sustained long enough so that one of the above criteria for relaxation of shear - stress from crust - anchored magnetic flux before cut - through is met , leads to a `` squeezing '' of surface * b * toward the ns spin - axis . after a large decrease in spin - period from an initial @xmath23 to @xmath24 all flux would enter and leave the core s surface from the small area within a radius @xmath25 of the ns s spin - axis .",
    "this surface * b*-field change is represented in figs 2 - 3 for the special case when the magnetic flux which exits the ns surface from its upper ( lower ) spin - hemisphere returns to the stellar surface in it s lower ( upper ) one .",
    "potentially observable features of such a `` spin - squeezed '' surface * b * configuration include the following .        )    a dipole moment nearly aligned along the ns spin - axis .    a greatly diminished polar cap spanning the `` open '' field lines when @xmath26 . for @xmath27 with @xmath28 the crust thickness ( @xmath29 ) , the canonical polar cap radius , @xmath30 , shrinks to @xmath31    a @xmath7-field just above the polar cap which has almost no curvature .",
    "if the pre - spin - up surface * b * has a sunspot - like configuration ( i.e. flux returning to the ns surface in the same hemisphere as that from which it left ) , the spin - up - squeezed field change is represented in figs 4 and 5 . in this case , potentially observable features when @xmath24 include the following .        )    a pulsar dipole moment nearly orthogonal to the ns spin - axis , and    positioned at the crust - core interface .    a dipole moment ( @xmath32 ) , or more precisely the component of @xmath32 perpendicular to @xmath33 , reduced from its pre - spin - up size : @xmath34    a more general ( and very probably more realistic ) pre - spin - up configuration has flux emitted from one spin - hemisphere returning to the stellar surface in both , as in fig . 6 .",
    "spin - up squeezing then typically gives the surface field configuration represented in fig .",
    "7 , a spin - squeezed , nearly orthogonal dipole on the ns spin - axis with properties ( d ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) , together with an aligned dipole on the spin - axis whose external field is well - represented by north and south poles a distance @xmath35 apart .",
