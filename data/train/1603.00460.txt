    "the self - regulation of star formation in galaxies by gas accretion and galactic outflows is a fundamental ingredient in the modern framework of galaxy evolution . both the analysis of large galaxy surveys and the direct observation of high - velocity clouds ( e.g. @xcite ) , as well as hydrodynamical simulations @xcite point towards the need for continuous accretion of pristine gas onto galaxies ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , historically , the so - called ` g - dwarf problem ' @xcite was solved by relaxing the hypothesis of a closed - box evolution of the solar neighborhood and allowing the accretion of pristine gas onto the disk , which acts in diluting the abundances ; in this way , one can reconcile the predicted frequency of metal - poor galactic disk stars ( which are too many in the framework of the simple closed - box model ) with the observed one .",
    "large scale galactic winds and outflows are also necessary to reproduce the overall properties of the observed galaxy population and to match the observed chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( igm ; see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "several observations of galactic outflows in the literature have demonstrated the ubiquity of the outflow phenomenon , both locally and at high redshift ( see , for example , @xcite ) , however understanding their impact on galaxy properties over cosmic time remains a daunting task .",
    "since metals are a direct product of star formation in galaxies , chemical abundances are a powerful probe of the feedback processes driving the evolution of galaxies .",
    "oxygen occupies a key role in this type of studies , since its gas phase abundance can be inferred from strong nebular lines easily observed in the optical wavelength range in the low redshift universe .",
    "since oxygen is the most common metal by mass , its abundance is also an excellent proxy for the total metallicity of the gas .",
    "moreover , since oxygen is mostly produced by massive stars , dying as core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) , its enrichment is relatively simple to model and does not require , to first approximation , taking into account the effect of stellar lifetimes ( under the so - called instantaneous recycling approximation , ira ) .    the study of the relation between oxygen abundance and other fundamental galaxy parameters like stellar mass @xcite , star formation rate ( sfr , @xcite ) , gas content @xcite and environment @xcite has paved the way to the development of a new generation of chemical evolution models @xcite , which succeed , to various extents , at reproducing the general trends observed in the data with cosmological inflow rates and various simple outflow prescriptions .",
    "since different chemical elements are released in the interstellar medium ( ism ) on different time - scales , the study of abundance ratios of some key elements can provide tighter constraints on the star formation and gas flow history of a system .",
    "for example , large galaxy surveys have demonstrated that the [ o / fe ] ratios in elliptical galaxies are consistent with the paradigm requiring these objects to form stars vigorously over a short timescale at high redshift @xcite .",
    "moreover , detailed analysis of chemical abundance ratios of n - capture , @xmath0 and iron - peak elements in individual stars in the milky way ( mw ) have been instrumental in showing that the various components of our galaxy ( halo , bulge , thick and thin disk ) have had different chemical evolution histories with respect to each other ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in the context of star forming",
    "galaxies , strong nebular lines in the optical range allow reliable measurement of the ( n / o ) abundance ratio when both the [ oii]@xmath1,@xmath2 and [ nii]@xmath3,@xmath4 doublets are measured .",
    "the ( n / o ) abundance ratio has been studied by several authors @xcite since it is a promising tool to shed light on the relative role of pristine gas inflows and outflows , which appear degenerate when only the abundance of one chemical element is traced ( see @xcite , but also the discussion in the appendix of @xcite ) .",
    "unlike oxygen , nitrogen is a chemical element mostly produced by low- and intermediate - mass stars ( lims ) , with the nucleosynthetic yields depending on metallicity in a complex fashion . in particular",
    ", a stellar generation can release into the galaxy ism both primary and secondary n. the secondary n component increases with metallicity , being a product of the cno cycle and formed at expenses of the c and o already present in the star .",
    "concerning lims , the primary n component is produced during the third dredge - up , occurring along the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase , if nuclear burning at the base of the convective envelope is efficient @xcite .",
    "the latter is particularly important for very metal - poor lims , which would not be capable otherwise of synthesizing significant amounts of secondary n. on the other hand , the computation of the n stellar yields for massive stars still suffers of large uncertainty , especially at very low metallicity , and none of the current existing stellar evolutionary codes is able to provide the right amount of primary n which is needed to reproduce the observed ( n / o ) plateau at very low metallicities .",
    "all the aforementioned complications prevent one from using ira and a constant yield for the study of nitrogen abundances in galaxies , and have prevented the community so far from taking full advantage of the large nitrogen abundance datasets now available both through large spectroscopic surveys of local ( like sdss , @xcite , or gama , @xcite ) and high - redshift ( e.g. zcosmos , @xcite ) galaxies .    in this work",
    "we critically revise the different assumptions affecting the interpretation of the ( n / o ) versus ( o / h ) abundance patterns , making use of a large dataset of star forming galaxies from the sdss , complemented by data from metal - poor dwarf galaxies to explore the low - metallicity regime .",
    "while considerable uncertainties still persist in some of the basic model parameters ( nitrogen yields , stellar initial mass function , imf ) we aim here at setting new constraints on pristine gas inflows and the models of outflows .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : data ] , we present the dataset used in this work for the ( n / o ) vs. ( o / h ) abundance diagram . in section [ sec : nucl ] , we summarize the current knowledge about the nucleosynthetic origin of nitrogen in stars . in section [ sec : descr ] , we describe the basic equations and the assumptions of the numerical model of chemical evolution adopted in this work .",
    "our results are presented in section [ sec : sdss_model ] and [ sec : low_z_tail ] ; in particular , in section [ sec : sdss_model ] , we focus on the results of our models for the ( n / o ) vs. ( o / h ) abundance pattern of the ensemble of the sdss galaxies ; in section [ sec : low_z_tail ] , we present the results of our models for the low metallicity plateau , which a complementary sample of metal - poor , diffuse and star - forming dwarf galaxies exhibit in the ( n / o ) vs. ( o / h ) diagram .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] , we end with our conclusions .",
    "in order to study the characteristic gas - phase oxygen and nitrogen abundances in local galaxies , we make use of the data from sdss data release 7 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dr7 ) and the emission line fluxes , stellar masses and sfr estimates presented in the mpa - jhu catalogue @xcite released as part of dr 8 @xcite .",
    "we select galaxies to have @xmath5 and s / n@xmath63 on the following emission lines : [ oii]@xmath7,@xmath8 ; [ oiii]@xmath9 ; h@xmath10 ; h@xmath11 ; [ nii]@xmath12 , and [ sii]@xmath13,@xmath14 .",
    "we use the standard baldwin - philipps - terlevich ( bpt ) diagram @xcite to exclude sources where the gas ionisation is not dominated by star formation , since available metallicity calibrations are only tailored to star forming regions . in this work we use the [ oiii]/h@xmath10 versus [ sii]/h@xmath11 diagnostic diagram and the demarcation curve of @xcite .",
    "we do not make use of the popular [ oiii]/h@xmath10 versus [ nii]/h@xmath11 to avoid a bias against nitrogen enriched hii regions @xcite .",
    "emission line fluxes are then corrected for dust extinction using the balmer decrement and the @xcite reddening curve with @xmath15 .",
    "the theoretical value for the balmer line ratio is taken from @xcite , assuming case b recombination ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "we note that the use of extinction curves of @xcite or @xcite yield very similar results for the wavelength range considered in this work .",
    "inferring gas phase oxygen abundance from strong nebular line ratios is a difficult problem , since the line ratios depend not only on ionic abundances , but also on other parameters , such as ionisation parameter , density and hardness of ionisation field .",
    "it is well known in the literature that different oxygen abundance calibrations based on strong nebular lines can lead to systematic discrepancies of up to @xmath17 dex @xcite . in particular , strong line calibrations based on an extrapolation to high metallicity of abundances measured with the @xmath18 method ( which makes use of the faint oxygen auroral line [ oiii]@xmath19 to directly infer the electron temperature of the nebula ) generally lead to lower abundances than calibrations based on photoionisation models .",
    "moreover , several metallicity calibrators make use of the nitrogen line fluxes , thus implicitly assuming that the relationship between the ( n / o ) ratio and metallicity varies monotonically with oxygen abundance .    in this work , we infer the oxygen and nitrogen abundances using the self - consistent framework presented in @xcite , which calibrates various strong line ratios through the electron temperature method . an alternative calibration taking both oxygen and nitrogen abundance into account has been recently presented in @xcite .    in order to sample the low metallicity regime , which is poorly populated in sdss , we make use of the data from @xcite for a collection of blue , diffuse and star forming dwarf galaxies .",
    "we note that the abundances reported by @xcite correspond to the chemical abundances as measured using the direct method and hence should fall onto the same scale of chemical abundances we inferred from the sdss data with the adopted calibration .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : data_all ] we show the trend of the observed ( n / o ) ratios as a function of the ( o / h ) abundances .",
    "the density plot in greyscale represents the abundance pattern as observed in the ensemble of the sdss galaxies , whereas the data with error bars represent the compilation of star forming dwarf galaxies from @xcite .",
    "the latter data extend towards lower ( o / h ) abundances than the sdss data and clearly exhibits the well - known low metallicity plateau .",
    "the sdss data show an abrupt change of the slope at oxygen abundances higher than @xmath20 .",
    "oxygen abundance calibrations based on nebular lines only trace the oxygen abundance of the gaseous phase of the ism . however , chemical elements in real galaxies are partially depleted on to dust grains .",
    "since chemical evolution models only predict the total metallicity , depletion onto dust grains must be taken into account when comparing models with our data . from an observational point of view , the dust content can differ among galaxies of different metallicity and sfr @xcite . in the framework of chemical evolution studies ,",
    "the most important physical process affecting the dust cycle in galaxies is the star formation history , which regulates the main feedback processes responsible for the dust production and destruction and hence the run of the galaxy dust - to - gas ratio with metallicity @xcite .",
    "[ fig : lims_yield ]     in the literature a mean oxygen depletion is the logarithmic decrement between the observed abundance of a chemical element and its predicted total abundance , @xmath21 , namely @xmath22 .",
    "] of @xmath23 is often assumed ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "although oxygen depletion is likely to have a dependance on metallicity ( differential depletion ) , for simplicity we do not consider this effect in this work .",
    "although @xcite suggests an average nitrogen depletion of @xmath24 , the large uncertainty in this estimate means that nitrogen is also consistent with zero depletion .",
    "indeed most of the studies indicate that nitrogen is not a refractory element and does not deplete onto grains even in the densest molecular clouds ( e.g. @xcite ) . in light of this , in our work",
    ", we do not consider any nitrogen depletion onto dust .",
    "while the depletion corrections applied in this work are rather arbitrary , none of our conclusions depend on the exact values of the depletion factors .",
    "according to its mass and initial chemical composition , each star pollutes the ism with different amounts of a given chemical element .",
    "since stellar lifetimes primarily depend upon the stellar mass , each chemical element is expected to enrich the ism of galaxies on different typical timescales .",
    "a fundamental aspect to take into account in chemical evolution models is the nature of the physical processes which give rise to the production of the various chemical elements in stars . in particular :    1 .",
    "if a sequence of nuclear reactions involves as initial seed only the h and he present in the gas mixture of the star at its birth , then the nucleosynthetic products of that sequence do not depend upon the initial stellar metallicity .",
    "the chemical products of these reactions are then named _ primary _ elements .",
    "if the presence of metals in the initial gas mixture of the star is necessary for some nuclear reactions to occur , then the nucleosynthetic products of those nuclear reactions depend on the metallicity .",
    "these chemical products are named _ secondary _ elements .    in modern chemical evolution studies ,",
    "the importance of distinguishing between the secondary and primary nature has been simplified for most of the chemical elements , since their yields are computed as a function of the initial metallicity .",
    "nevertheless , for chemical elements like nitrogen , which have both a primary and secondary origin ( see , for example , @xcite ) , it can be conceptually useful to separate the two components , even in the presence of yields computed for different metallicities .",
    "nitrogen is mainly produced during the cno cycle , whose main branch consists in a series of @xmath25-captures and @xmath26 decays starting from an atom of @xmath27c and converting four protons into a nucleus of he ( with two @xmath28 and two @xmath29 as byproducts ) . since the inner reaction @xmath30 proceeds with the slowest rate among the other in the sequence , when the equilibrium condition is reached ( namely , when the rate of production of each cno nucleus equals its rate of destruction ) , the ultimate effect of the cno cycle is to convert most of the cno isotopes into @xmath31n .",
    "the origin of the initial @xmath27c seed in the cno cycle is a discriminating factor .",
    "in fact , if the atom of @xmath27c was initially present in the gas mixture from which the star originated , then the synthesized nitrogen behaves as a secondary element . on the other hand ,",
    "if some physical mechanism is able to carry the c and o nuclei produced in the he - burning zones out to the h - burning zones , then the synthesized nitrogen behaves like a primary element .",
    "low- and intermediate - mass ( lim ) stars during the agb phase eject into the ism significant amounts of he , c and n. the ejected masses reflect important abundance variations . the main physical mechanism for the transport of the c and o nuclei to the outer zones of the star",
    "is given by the so - called third dredge - up , which is the transfer of the nucleosynthetic products of the triple-@xmath11 process by the surface convection which proceeds after each thermal pulse .",
    "primary nitrogen can then be produced when the hot - bottom burning ( cno burning at the base of the convective envelope ) occurs in combination with the third dredge - up ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lims_yield ] , we show how the stellar yields of @xcite for c , o , and primary and secondary n vary as a function of the initial stellar mass , for different metalliticities .",
    "the stellar yield of a given chemical element @xmath32 is defined as the ejected amount of mass of the newly formed @xmath32 . by looking at the figure , the stellar yields of secondary n increase with metallicity , by means of the consumption of the c and o nuclei originally present in the star . in fact , during the cno cycle , the global abundance of the cno nuclei remains constant , while the relative abundances of each cno element can significantly vary . by looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : lims_yield ] , the stellar producers of primary n have masses in the range between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , the production of primary n does not show any correlation with the consumption of the original c and o in the star , as expected .",

    "* see fig .",
    "[ fig : data_all ] ) , thus confirming that there should be primary n production in massive stars .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that primary n can be produced in rapidly rotating massive stars , but only at very low metallicity .",
    "their proposed main physical mechanism is given by the so - called rotational mixing , particularly efficient at very low metallicity , where stars are expected to rotate faster and to be much more compact than their metal - rich counterparts .",
    "rotational mixing allows the nucleosynthetic products of the triple-@xmath11 reaction ( mainly c and o nuclei ) to efficiently diffuse towards the outer cno burning zone , where a pure primary nitrogen can then be synthesized @xcite .",
    "this unfortunately can not solve the problem of the observed ( n / o ) plateau , which extends all over the metallicity range of mw halo stars .",
    "in fact , geneva stellar evolutionary models predict fast rotating massive stars to produce primary n only in a narrow range at very low metallicity ; as the metallicity @xmath59 , these stars resume producing only secondary n. therefore , by assuming the theoretical stellar yields of the geneva group , chemical evolution models predicted a ` dip ' in the ( n / o ) ratio at low ( o / h ) abundances , which is never observed ( see , for example , @xcite , and the further discussion in section [ sec : empirical_yield ] and [ sec : low_z_tail ] ) . to solve this discrepancy and be able to explain the observed trends in the data , all previous chemical evolution models @xcite had to assume artificially a pure primary n yield from massive stars .      in order to re - assess the problem of primary nitrogen production in massive stars , we suggest a revised primary n stellar yield at low metallicity .    in table [ table_yields ] we report the imf - averaged stellar yields of n and o from massive stars , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively , as computed by using the @xcite compilation of stellar yields and assuming the @xcite imf",
    ". we also report how the values of @xmath62 are predicted to vary for different metallicities , when considering only the contributions of massive stars to the nitrogen and oxygen chemical enrichment of the ism .",
    "we observe that the geneva stellar models predict a dip in the ( n / o ) ratios for @xmath63 .",
    "this dip is never observed and it stems from the lack of primary n production by massive stars for @xmath63 .    in order to reproduce the low - metallicity plateau , we therefore calculate the average amount of primary n that massive stars should provide to reproduce the observed ( n / o ) plateau at very low metallicities .",
    "we assume that the oxygen yields in this regime are reliable and we require the predicted ( n / o ) ratios to match the observed @xmath64 at low metallicity . in particular , we empirically derive the needed average stellar yield of primary nitrogen by massive stars as @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 represent the atomic weight of n and o , respectively . the calculated values of @xmath68 are reported in the last column of table [ table_yields ] .",
    "interestingly , at extremely low z , the latter are of the same order of magnitude as the value of @xmath69 originally adopted in chemical evolution models to reproduce the low - metallicity plateau ( see also @xcite , and references therein ) .    for the rest of this work , in our reference chemical evolution models , we assume a pure primary n production by massive stars , with the stellar yields at the various metallicities being the quantity @xmath68 , as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nprim ] ) and reported in the last column of table [ table_yields ] .",
    "we remark on the fact that , because of the way we have defined it , this quantity depends on the assumed imf and stellar yields of oxygen .",
    "in this work , we study the nitrogen and oxygen evolution in the ism of galaxies by adopting a chemical evolution model in which the galaxy is assumed to be composed of a single zone within which the various chemical elements are assumed to mix instantaneously and uniformly . the basic ingredients of the model are described in detail in @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the model is capable of following the temporal evolution of the abundances of various chemical elements within the ism of galaxies , by taking into account the main physical processes driving chemical evolution , such as star formation , inflows and outflows of gas .      by defining @xmath70 as the gas mass in the galaxy which is in the form of the @xmath71-th chemical element at time @xmath72 ,",

    ", we assume the stellar lifetimes of @xcite .",
    "we assume a star formation law of the form @xmath77 , with @xmath78 being the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) , a free parameter of our models .    the term @xmath79 in equation [ eq : chem_mod ] represents the rate at which stars return the @xmath71-th chemical element back to the ism at their death .",
    "this term subsumes all our prescriptions about the stellar yields as well as the assumptions concerning sn progenitors . in particular , for type ia sne , we assume the ` single degenerate scenario ' with the same prescriptions as in @xcite , however the details of the treatment of type ia sne are largely irrelevant to this work , since they only have a very minor effect in the enrichment of oxygen and nitrogen .      in our model ,",
    "the galaxy is assumed to assemble by means of accretion of gas from an external reservoir into the potential well of an underlying dark matter ( dm ) halo .",
    "the gas infall rate , @xmath80 , follows an exponential form with time given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the age of the galaxy and @xmath83 is the abundance by mass of the @xmath71-th chemical element in the infalling gas ( @xmath84 ) , whose chemical composition is assumed to be primordial .      in equation",
    "[ eq : chem_mod ] the outflow rate is modelled by @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the so - called _ mass loading factor_. observations generally suggest that star - forming galaxies experience time - averaged outflow loading factors of order unity @xcite at stellar masses around @xmath87 , close to the knee of the luminosity function .",
    "it is , however , likely that less massive galaxies experience much higher loading factors .    in this work ,",
    "we assume the galactic wind to be _ differential _ ; namely , the outflow carries only the main nucleosynthetic products of core - collapse sne ( mainly @xmath11-elements ) , for which @xmath86 is a constant value . for chemical elements such as nitrogen and carbon , which have a very minor contribution from sne ,",
    "we assume a null mass loading factor , i.e. @xmath88 . the assumption of a differential outflow is justified by the fact that massive stars ( the progenitors of core - collapse sne and the most important oxygen producers in the universe ) are observed to be highly clustered and so , as they explode , they create a region of the ism in which the filling factor closely approaches to unity ( see @xcite ) .        interestingly , the first works suggesting a differential metal - enhanced galactic wind in the context of the study of chemical evolution of galaxies were those of @xcite and @xcite , which addressed also the issue of explaining the ( n / o ) vs. ( o / h ) abundance pattern observed in dwarf irregular galaxies ( see @xcite for a detailed study and references ) .",
    "we are aware that our assumption of a differential galactic wind is highly uncertain and it does not rely on firm theoretical and observational findings ; further detailed investigations are needed , by looking  for example  at the chemical abundances in the halo of the mw or in quasar absorption lines , which were also related in the past to galactic winds .    following the formalism of @xcite , the time for the onset of the galactic outflow is calculated by requiring the thermal energy of the gas ( supplied by sne and stellar winds to the galaxy ism ) to be larger than the binding energy of the gas to the galaxy potential well .      in this work",

    "the predicted low - metallicity plateau is the effect of our assumption of a pure primary n production by massive stars .",
    "the increase of the ( n / o ) ratios from @xmath97 is due to the delayed chemical feedback of lims , which pollute the ism with primary _ and _ secondary nitrogen ; we will refer to this change in slope as the ` first break point ' . by definition , the production of secondary nitrogen by lims increases as the metallicity increases . although the production of primary n is smaller than the one of secondary n ( see fig . [",
    "fig : lims_yield ] ) , the main primary n producers turns out to be , on average , less massive and hence more long - living than the bulk of the secondary n producers . in this way",
    ", the pollution of the ism with primary n by lims mimics and amplifies the secondary n component . at @xmath98",
    ", we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : ref_model ] a new change in slope ( ` second break point ' ) , which is caused by the onset of the galactic wind .",
    "since we assume a differential outflow , the loss of oxygen per unit time is more efficient than the loss of nitrogen ( which is set to zero ) . in this way",
    ", the accumulation of oxygen within the galaxy ism slows down and the net effect of the galactic wind is to steepen the ( n / o ) ratios as the chemical evolution proceeds .",
    "we remark that the increase of the ( n / o ) ratios after the second break point is also crucially bolstered by the larger amounts of secondary n which lims are able to synthesize at higher z.      in this section we discuss the effect of varying the free parameters in the reference model .",
    "in particular , we show that the main parameters influencing the shape of the ( n / o ) vs ( o / h ) relation are the star formation efficiency , the outflow loading factor and the assumptions regarding the differential outflow loading for n and o. other parameters , such as the infall mass and the infall timescale do not have a significant effect on the abundance trends studied .      in fig .",

    "the common evolution of all the galaxies before the onset of the galactic wind stems from the fact that all these models assume a fixed sfe ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the models developing the galactic wind first are the ones with the smallest infall mass , which depart from the common track at the lowest ( o / h ) abundances ; in fact , such models are characterized by a lower galaxy potential well , and hence they develop the outflow at earlier times .",
    "overall the infall mass in our models does not play a key role in defining the shape of the ( n / o ) vs ( o / h ) relation .",
    "the infall time - scale regulates the rate of accretion of the gas into the system .",
    "in particular , by fixing the values of the other parameters , models with longer infall time - scales predict the galactic wind to develop at earlier times , since the binding energy of the gas to the whole galaxy is lower , at any time of the galaxy evolution .",
    "this can be appreciated by looking at fig .",

    "increasing the sfe speeds up the production of oxygen per unit time by massive stars in the earliest stages of the galaxy chemical evolution .",
    "since we assume that nitrogen is synthesized by massive stars as a pure primary element , the increasing of the sfe does not affect much the ( n / o ) ratio in the low metallicity regime .    in fig .",

    "the first large effect in the ( n / o ) vs ( o / h ) diagram can be seen at the first break point ; in particular , the higher the sfe , the larger is the metal content within the galaxy as first lims die , causing the ( n / o ) ratios to increase . in conclusion ,",
    "an increase of the sfe determines a wider range in metallicity of the initial ( n / o ) plateau due to the chemical enrichment of massive stars .",
    "this is a sort of application of the so - called ` time - delay model'@xcite to the ( n / o ) vs. ( o / h ) diagram .",
    "we remind the reader that by _ time - delay model _ we mean the classical way of interpreting the trend of the observed [ @xmath11/fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] abundance patterns in galaxies , where key roles are played by the assumed sfe and the delayed chemical enrichment by type ia sne ; in particular , the higher the sfe in galaxies , the larger is the [ fe / h ] abundance of the ism as first type ia sne explode and hence the [ @xmath11/fe ] ratios steeply decrease .        in fig .",

    "galaxies with very low sfes struggle to reach high ( o / h ) abundances , spending most of their evolutionary time at low metallicities .",
    "conversely , models with higher sfes predict galaxies to reach the ( o / h ) abundances of the sdss data at earlier times .",
    "once the galactic wind develops , there is an interplay between the rate of restitution of oxygen into the galaxy ism by dying stars and the rate of removal of oxygen by galactic wind and star formation ; this causes the ( o / h ) abundances to increase more gradually with time than before the onset of the galactic wind .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : time_evol]b ) , we show how the predicted ( n / o ) ratios vary as a function of the time , when varying the sfe . in the earliest stages of the galaxy evolution ,",
    "all the models tend towards @xmath102 , which corresponds to the nitrogen - to - oxygen ratio of the low metallicity plateau . as first lims die , the ( n / o ) ratio",
    "is predicted to suddenly increase , because of the large amounts of both primary and secondary",
    "n which lims are capable of synthesize . in summary ,",
    "the higher the sfe , the earlier and the higher are the metallicities ( as discussed above ) when lims start dying , causing the ( n / o ) ratio to increase .",
    "the effect of the onset of the galactic wind is less visible in this figure , and it corresponds to the gradual change in the slope of the ( n / o ) vs. time relation occurring at later times .",
    "our reference model assumes a differential outflow , which carries only the nucleosynthetic products of core - collapse sne ( mainly @xmath11-elements ) out of the galaxy potential well .",
    "hence the mass loading factor , @xmath103 , quoted in the reference model only refers to oxygen , since nitrogen is assumed not to be expelled .",
    "obviously , in reality , some nitrogen would be lost to the igm , but here we consider its mass loading factor to be much lower than the one of oxygen , since core - collapse sne are minor contributors of n in galaxies and the galactic wind ( mainly triggered by sn explosions ) develops when lims have already heavily polluted the ism with nitrogen , overcoming the n enrichment from massive stars .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : param]d ) , we show the effect of almost doubling the mass loading factor on the ( n / o ) vs. ( o / h ) abundance pattern . by definition",
    "this parameter only has an effect after the galactic wind has started ; this occurs at @xmath104 in our reference model .",

    "[ fig : param]d ) , corresponding to models with differential and non - differential outflow , respectively .",
    "concerning the model with a differential outflow , @xmath103 has the clear effect of changing the slope of the ( n / o ) vs ( o / h ) relation at high metallicity .",
    "importantly , even in the case of the reference model , this slope is much steeper than unity , which is the naive prediction for the secondary nitrogen enrichment . by looking at eq .",
    "[ eq : chem_mod ] , the slope is crucially determined by the balance between the loss of oxygen via galactic winds ( and star formation ) and the restitution of oxygen by massive stars .",
    "if the latter exceeds the former , the slope is positive , otherwise it is negative .",
    "concerning the model with a non - differential outflow , the transition between the sf - dominated regime and the outflow - dominated regime is smooth , since both oxygen and nitrogen are lost from the galaxy potential well with the same efficiency @xmath103 .      in fig .",

    "* the best imf for the mw disk ; see @xcite ) , hosts a large number of lims and a much smaller number of massive stars than the @xcite imf , and it provides the best agreement with the observed dataset among the classical imfs considered in this work .",
    "imfs like @xcite and @xcite , which are very similar among each other , host a larger number of massive stars and hence an enhanced oxygen - production is predicted at the early stages of galaxy evolution ; so the first break point occurs at higher metallicities when the @xcite or the @xcite imf are assumed .",
    "the main effect of the imf is to shift the chemical evolution tracks along the ( o / h ) axis .",
    "in fact , the main role of the imf is to assign different weights to stars in different mass ranges .",
    "in this subsection , we present chemical evolution models for star forming , metal - poor dwarf galaxies , in order to reproduce the observed low metallicity tail of the ( n / o ) ratios .",
    "the data of @xcite clearly exhibit a plateau in the ( n / o ) ratios , which extends towards low ( o / h ) abundances .",

    "[ fig : dwarf ] can be explained by means of the same mechanism which has been mentioned throughout all the text : very low sfes cause a slow production of oxygen by massive stars ; this fact allows the ism to be quite metal - poor when lims begin to highly pollute the ism with nitrogen .",
    "therefore , lowering the sfes causes the plateau of the ( n / o ) ratios to be less extended in metallicity and hence the first break to occur at lower z. this explanation is a sort of application of the time - delay model to the ( n / o ) vs. ( o / h ) diagram . by comparing models and data ,",
    "we can obtain a good qualitative agreement , clearly suggesting that a pure primary n production by massive stars is needed to explain and reproduce the low - metallicity plateau .    by assuming the n stellar yields of massive stars collected by @xcite , which include the results of the stellar evolutionary code of the geneva group taking into account the effects of mass loss and rotation , all our chemical evolution models predict a dip in the ( n / o ) ratios when going towards low ( o / h ) abundances ( see also table [ table_yields ] ) , at variance with observations .",

    "3 .   a fundamental aspect to take into account for explaining the trend of the observed ( n / o ) vs. ( o / h )",
    "abundance pattern is the time - delay with which lims start enriching the ism with both primary and secondary n. in fact , before the first lims die , massive stars are the only nitrogen and oxygen producers in galaxies",
    ". when lims start dying , the n abundance within the galaxy ism steeply increases . since the stellar yields of the secondary n component by lims increase with metallicity , then the ( n / o ) ratios continuously grow as a function of the ( o / h ) abundance .",
