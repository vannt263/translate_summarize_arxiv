    "the pion electromagnetic ( em ) or charge form - factor is one of the simplest quantity in qcd .",
    "some new experiments on this quantity at relatively large momentum transfers are under way@xcite . while there exist a few lattice computations @xcite , none of them respect the chiral symmetry sufficiently well .",
    "the new experimental data with small errors might not only impose strong restrictions to some phenomenological models , but give stringent test of lattice qcd .",
    "we calculate the pion em form - factor in the quenched lattice qcd with domain wall fermions ( dwf ) with several momentum transfers which partially cover the above experiments .",
    "the dwf enables us to access lighter quark masses than ever , because it has good chiral properties which are quite important for the nambu - goldstone bosons like a pion .",
    "we employ the dwf action for the quark action .",
    "the number of sites in the fifth direction is @xmath0 and the domain wall height @xmath1 .",
    "quark masses are taken to be @xmath20.08 , 0.06 , 0.04 and 0.02 whose pion masses in the physical unit are about 760 , 660 , 540 and 390 mev , respectively .",

    "@xmath11 is computed non - perturbatively using the swendsen s blocking and the schwinger - dyson method . the gauge coupling is taken to be @xmath12 which gives the lattice spacing @xmath13 gev and a sufficient spatial lattice volume @xmath14 for a pion .",
    "the number of configuration is 100 .",
    "some fundamental chiral properties on the dwf and dbw2 actions are elaborated in ref.@xcite .",
    "explicit chiral symmetry breaking due to the finiteness of the fifth direction @xmath15 is characterized by the residual mass @xmath16 .",
    "in fact it is shown in ref.@xcite that the dbw2 gauge action gives smaller @xmath16 than those of other ( wilson , symanzik and iwasaki ) gauge actions .",
    "our present results of @xmath16 and the linearly extrapolated value are shown in fig .",

    "they are much smaller than the quark masses @xmath17 .",
    "-1 cm    -5 mm    now we turn to the pion em form - factor @xmath18 defined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the em current .",
    "we note @xmath22 is the electric charge of a pion and we employ this relation as a numerical check .",
    "the structure of the 3-point function in eq.([eq : piff ] ) in our calculation is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thrp ] .",
    "we use an appropriate smeared source and a local sink .",
    "the separation between the source and the sink is 24 in the lattice unit .",
    "a momentum is injected at the sink and flows into the current insertion , i.e. , only one quark propagator has a non - zero momentum .",
    "this method is statistically efficient for small momentum transfers .",
    "the presently calculated momentum transfers of the form - factor are @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the unit of @xmath25 with the spatial lattice size @xmath26 .",
    "they correspond to physical values of @xmath27 0 , 0.26 , 0.53 gev@xmath28 , respectively .",
    "larger momentum transfers will be investigated in near future .",
    "we employ the sequential source technique@xcite , when we solve the quark propagator with the finite momentum .",
    "the em current taken here is the local current , @xmath29 , which is not conserved on the lattice and requires operator renormalization to compare with the matrix element in the continuum , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the vector current renormalization factor . instead of @xmath31",
    ", however , we use an axial - vector current renormalization factor @xmath32 , because this quantity is so far well investigated in the derivation of the pion decay constant and the relation @xmath33 is satisfied in dwf up to @xmath34 errors .",
    "this equality is confirmed numerically in the dwf and dbw2 action within a few percent @xcite .",
    "we show the present results of @xmath32 in fig .",

    "the computations were carried out by qcdsp in bnl and the columbia university . we have calculated the pion em form - factor from both the electric @xmath37 and magnetic @xmath38 sectors of the 3-point function and checked the consistency within the errors .",
    "we show in figs . [",
