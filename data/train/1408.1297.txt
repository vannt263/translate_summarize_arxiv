    "the feature selection ( fs ) literature contains a wide variety of approaches designed to extract a subset of features that optimizes a given objective function @xcite .",
    "these techniques are generally grouped into 2 approaches ; the wrapper approach aims at choosing a feature subset that can improve the performance of a classifier , whereas , the filter approach consists of an objective function that exploits statistical properties of the data ( e.g. information content , correlation coefficient ) @xcite .",
    "many empirical studies have reported that genetic algorithm ( ga ) based fs outperforms sequential search techniques for problems that involve a considerable number of features ( typically @xmath2 50 ) @xcite . here , we present a novel crossover operator for the genetic algorithm ( ga ) based fs task and implement a wrapper model to illustrate its characteristics .",
    "typically , bit - string chromosome representations have been used where the bits represent the absence / presence of a feature @xcite , however , index representations ( features encoded as numeric values ) have also been implemented @xcite .",
    "lucasius et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a crossover operator for index representation which was built upon the preservation of four basic properties of an encoded feature subset , identity , position , order , and adjacency , while transferring information from the parents to the daughter chromosome .",
    "radcliffe @xcite developed the rrr crossover operator for index representation and introduced the idea of respect , i.e. the child must inherit the common features between the parent chromosomes .",
    "mathias et al .",
    "@xcite have implemented similar encoding scheme and introduced the mmx , the mmx - s , and the msx crossover operators that maintain positive and negative respect in the absence of any mutation .",
    "the positive respect requires that the child must inherit common features between the parents and in order that the negative respect be maintained , the child should not contain features that are absent in both the parents . as a consequence of maintaining respect during the crossover ,",
    "the above operators are known to produce convergence controlled variation ( ccv ) @xcite ; there is less variation among the chromosomes as the search converges . by introducing mutation to relax the requirement of negative respect ,",
    "a convergence controlled mutation ( ccm ) can be achieved . for the purposes of this paper",
    ", we are interested to device two crossover operators , one that exhibits ccm and the other that has a quasi - constant mutation rate .",
    "also , in order to facilitate encoding subsets of variable lengths , we decided to use index representation .",
    "some engineering applications require that multiple fs problems be solved simultaneously .",
    "for example , roy et al .",
    "@xcite developed a spike neural network ( snn ) based classifier to characterize the alcoholic brain using visually evoked response potentials .",
    "this task involved simultaneously solving two fs problems ; one that required choosing a correct subset of eeg leads along with the lead - weights ( features with attributes ) and the other that defined the temporal pattern to be detected .",
    "it can be inferred from the literature review that not much work has been done for simultaneously solving multiple fs problems , and where the features may contain numeric attributes . here , we introduce two versions of mmx - blx operator , which is an extension of the mmx - sss operator @xcite , to accommodate these requirements .",
    "the versions vary based on the level of exploration and exploitation they perform , hence we call them mmx - blx@xmath0 and mmx - blx@xmath1 .",
    "we illustrate the characteristic of the above crossover operators by evolving temporal pattern detectors to characterize the alcoholic brain .",
    "mathais et al . @xcite introduced the concept of positive / negative respect and presented the msx and the mmx crossover operators for subset selection problems where the subset size was predetermined .",
    "these operators were made more exploratory by compromising negative respect ; the positions in the daughter chromosomes which consisted of unmatched elements , i.e. elements which are not common between parents , were mutated with a certain predefined probability . by introducing a numeric gene to encode the subset size ( sss ) , schaffer et al .",
    "@xcite extended the msx and the mmx crossover operators for fs problems where the sss was not predefined but only an upper bound ( @xmath3 ) on the sss was given . in order to crossover the sss gene , the blx operator @xcite was used .",
    "the sss gene defined an acceptance boundary on the chromosome such that the encoded features on the right side of this boundary remained unexpressed ; i.e. these features were not included in the subset .",
    "therefore , in order to preserve the important features , mmx - sss @xcite copied the common genes to offspring one position to the left of their parental positions . here",
    ", we introduce the mmx - blx@xmath0 and the mmx - blx@xmath1 crossover operators which are built upon the foundation of the mmx - sss operator .",
    "we do not use a sss gene ; as a consequence , the order in which the features are encoded is irrelevant .",
    "also , we allow the features to have multiple numeric attributes where the attributes of the common parental features are mated using the blx operator @xcite .",
    "below we briefly present the blx and the mmx - sss crossover operators in order to introduce the important concepts necessary to explain the steps involved in mmx - blx .",
    "radcliffe s flat crossover ( fx ) operator @xcite for numeric genes produces an offspring by uniformly picking a value between an interval defined by the parental allele - values ( see figure  [ fig1]a ) .",
    "the possible allele - values for the child are defined by a rectangular region for a 2-d problem,(see figure  [ fig1]b ) , a region enclosed by a cuboid for a 3-d problem , and so on .",
    "thus , the fx operator is respectful of this interval .",
    "such a strategy is exploitative in nature and may lead to a premature convergence .",
    "eshelman s and schaffer s @xcite blx-@xmath4 ( @xmath5 @xmath4 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 0 @xmath9 @xmath4 @xmath10 ) operator is a generalization of fx that allows the child to have allele - values in an extended region defined by the parameter @xmath4 ( see figure  [ fig1]a ) : blx-@xmath11 is same as fx .",
    "if a child inherits an allele - value outside of the region bounded by the parent s allele - values , then it is considered to be a mutation - event . clearly , the blx-@xmath4 ( for @xmath4 @xmath2 0 ) operator is a crossover / mutation operator where the level of mutation is coupled with the degree to which the population is converged , as a result it exhibits ccm .",

    "all chromosomes are of fixed length ( @xmath3 ) , however , the number of genes that can be expressed may vary ; this is defined using the sss gene .",

    "* crossover sss gene : * perform blx using the parent sss genes to generate an integer value for the child sss - gene .",
    "mutation : * in order to allow for more exploration , the positions in the offspring occupied by the inherited unique genes will be replaced by an allele value randomly generated within an allowed range based on a predefined mutation rate .",
    "care should be taken so that the same feature is not encoded twice .    as a consequence of maintaining positive respect ( during crossover ) , over many generations",
    "more chromosomes will contain common features ( genes ) .",
    "also , as the inherited common elements in an offspring are never mutated , this will result in a ccm .",
    "clearly , ccm is an important property that both blx and mmx - sss share .",
    "the mmx - blx crossover operator is designed for simultaneously solving @xmath29 fs problems where the features may have multiple numeric attributes and the subset sizes are not predefined . in order to accommodate these requirements we had to introduce a complex chromosome structure that consists of @xmath29 sub - chromosomes , where the sub - chromosome-@xmath30 ( @xmath5 @xmath30 @xmath6 @xmath31 @xmath8 1 @xmath9 @xmath30 @xmath9 @xmath29 @xmath10 ) encodes a subset for the @xmath32 fs task .",
    "the mmx - blx operation involves 3 basic tasks : defining the length of an offspring s @xmath32 sub - chromosome , modifying the attributes of the parental features , and defining the rules by which the offspring shall inherit features for the @xmath32 fs task .",
    "all the parameters that are necessary for these tasks are listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "below , we have explained the steps for accomplishing these tasks .",
    ".[table1 ] the above table illustrates the parameters required by the mmx - blx crossover operator .",

    "both , mmx - blx@xmath1 and mmx - blx@xmath0 provides a mechanism to simultaneously solve multiple fs problems where the features may have numeric attribute(s ) and the subset size is not predefined . since , mmx - blx@xmath0 prioritizes positive respect it is able to perform rigorous search in a region defined by the parental chromosomes . on the one hand",
    "this feature allows it to perform better on the training set , but on the other hand it seems to yield less general solutions .",
    "a soft - restart mechanism may allow mmx - blx@xmath0 to perform more exploratory search .",
    "mmx - blx@xmath1 seem to be able to find more robust solutions by virtue of quasi - constant mutation process even - though the fitness function used did not explicitly evaluate generalization .",
    "mutation allows more exploration by sacrificing respect ; this trade - off may be problem specific and requires additional investigation .",
    "the conventional techniques used for distinguishing the alcoholic verps from the controls primarily consist of 2 steps , developing a set of feature vectors and training a classifier using these feature vectors @xcite .",
    "most authors have used the information in the gamma band ( 30 - 50 hz ) to develop feature vectors .",
    "using , the evolutionary learning paradigm along with the tpd technology we were able to solve this problem in 1 step ; we did not make any assumptions regarding the data .",
    "the tpd technology introduced here is an extension of the pattern detector developed by roy et al . @xcite and provides a mechanism to assign partial credits to temporal patterns that vary from the desired specification .",
    "we believe this makes the search landscape more favorable to an effective evolutionary search . finally , by allowing the evolution to interact with the environment ( the alcoholic teacher signal ) , the search for a temporal pattern that can characterize the alcoholic verp is made more manageable .",
