    "the piecewise deterministic markov processes were first introduced in the literature by davis ( @xcite and @xcite ) , they form a family of cdlg markov processes involving a deterministic motion punctuated by random jumps .",
    "we refer to the paper @xcite and its references for an overview of pdmps .",
    "let us detail the special case of pdmps that will be considered in this paper .",
    "the motion of the pdmp @xmath6 depends on three local characteristics , namely the jump rate @xmath2 , the flow @xmath7 and a deterministic increasing function @xmath8 which governs the location of the process at the jump time ( in the general case it depends on a markov kernel @xmath9 ) .",
    "the process starts from @xmath10 and follows the flow @xmath11 until the first jump time @xmath12 which occurs spontaneously in a poisson - like fashion with rate @xmath13 .",
    "the location of the process at the jump time @xmath12 , denoted by @xmath14 , is equal to @xmath15 , with @xmath8 a function such that @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "the motion restarts from this new point @xmath18 as before .",
    "this fully describes a piecewise continuous trajectory for @xmath19 with jump times @xmath20 and post jump locations @xmath21 , and which evolves according to the flow @xmath7 between two jumps .",
    "this paper analyzes a special case of both piecewise deterministic markov process ( pdmps ) and growth - fragmentation model .",
    "the fisrt known example for this class of processes is the tcp window size process ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the tcp protocol is one of the main data transmission protocols of the internet .",
    "it has been designed to adapt to the various traffic conditions of the actual network . for a connection ,",
    "the maximum number of packets that can be sent at each round is given by a variable @xmath22 , called the congestion window size .",
    "if all the @xmath22 packets are successfully transmitted , then @xmath22 is increased by 1 , otherwise it is multiplied by @xmath23 ( detection of a congestion ) . as shown in @xcite a correct scaling of this process leads to a continuous time markov process , called general tcp window size process .",
    "the second example is the processes modeling the size of a `` marked '' _ escherichia coli _ cell ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . if by following the evolution of _ escherichia coli _ bacterium , we chose at random a bacteria , and follow his growth , and at his division , we choose randomly , and independently of the process , to follow one of his daughter and on so one .",
    "we call the bacteria follow at each time , the `` marked '' bacteria",
    ". the size of the `` marked '' bacteria is a pdmp .",
    "more precisely between the jumps , the bacteria grows exponentially with a growth rate which we will refer to later as the instantaneous growth rate .",
    "the division rate of such process is denoted by @xmath24 and at each jump its size is divided by two .    in both cases",
    "the value of the process is divided in a deterministically way at each jump .",
    "the purpose of this article is to perform non - parametric estimation of the jump rate based on a single observation of the process over a long time interval .",
    "the assumptions made in this paper ensure that the markov process which gives the size after each jump of the pdmp is ergodic . the ergodic theorem was already known for some cases of pdmps and for some one - dimensional jump - diffusions . in @xcite cloez",
    "studies a process which is more general than the one considered in this paper .",
    "more precisely , his process evolves like a diffusion which satisfies a stochastic differential equation between the jumps , but he requires that @xmath2 be bounded below .",
    "this paper does not make such assumption .",
    "in addition , the well known ergodicity properties of tcp , due to j .- m .",
    "bardet et al .",
    "@xcite , provide quantitative estimates for the exponential convergence to equilibrium , in terms of the total variation and wasserstein distances .",
    "however , such results can not be used in the present framework as we need a uniform upper bound for the speed of convergence to the invariant measure over a certain class of functions in order to prove the statistical result .",
    "our approach is based on the methods used by doumic et al .",
    "@xcite , which were applied to analyse a special case of pdmps dealing with `` marked '' bacteria size evolution .",
    "the analytical results of this paper can be generalized to more general pdmps , for example to tcp .",
    "in @xcite the authors do not merely study the `` marked '' bacterium which is selected at each division uniformly and independently , but the evolution of all bacteria involved .",
    "a dependence structure results when , for example , a bacteria divides and gives birth to two new bacterium of equal size . in a general case , the instantaneous growth rate ( constant for a given bacteria ) would depend on the bacteria itself .",
    "consequently , the size of the bacterium is no longer a markov process .",
    "however , on the other hand , the size of the process and the instantaneous growth rate , together form a markov process .",
    "the present paper contains the case of a `` marked '' bacterium , in its simple case , where the instantaneous growth rate is the same for all bacteria .",
    "this article has two main features that may be useful for future studies .",
    "first , it can be used as a tool to verify the pdmp jump rate proposed in the existing literature , for example @xmath25 in the tcp case .",
    "secondly , it can suggest an estimator for some special cases , such as for _ escherichia coli _ bacteria , where the jump rate is not known .    in @xcite azas et al .",
    "give an estimator of the conditional distribution of the inter - jump times for a pdmp , which is uniformly consistent when only one observation of the process within a long time is available .",
    "they deal with pdmps which jump when they hit the boundary ( this case is not considered in our paper ) .",
    "their method relies on a generalization of aalen s multiplicative intensity model @xcite .",
    "but they only prove the uniform consistency of their estimator .",
    "they also have to assume that the process @xmath6 evolves in a bounded space . here",
    "we do not make this assumption . as a consequence",
    "the tools of their paper and of the present one are different . to the best of my knowledge",
    ", @xcite is the only work investigating the nonparametric estimation of the conditional distribution of the inter - arrival times for pdmps .",
    "this paper relies on @xcite in which the authors focus on the non parametric estimation of the jump rate and the cumulative rate for a class of non homogeneous marked renewal processes .",
    "the case where the post - jump locations of the pdmp do not depend on inter - arrival times was considered in @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an overview of the statistical methods related to this kind of process , as well as to @xcite for statistical inference related to the multiplicative intensity model .",
    "the book of andersen et al .",
    "@xcite gives a comprehensive account of estimation for jump rates which depend both on time and spatial variable .",
    "as far as i know , the only other paper dealing with general pdmp is the work of azas @xcite , where the author focuses on a non parametric recursive estimator for the transition kernel of the pdmp .",
    "other works dealing with specific cases of pdmp can been seen as ruin probability , for example , as found in the references of @xcite . in addition , the pdmp modeling the quantity of a given food contaminant in the body has been studied in @xcite , assuming that the inter - intake times are i.i.d .. in this paper we do not make this assumption .",
    "the paper of azas and genadot @xcite consider a growth - fragmentation model where @xmath2 is constant and the markov kernel @xmath9 is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "the case considered is totally different from the present one .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ 2 ] we introduce the class of pdmps , that will be studied , and we give an explicit construction of the pdmp . section [ 3 ] concerns the statistical estimation of the jump rate .",
    "we first define the observation scheme and the class of functions for the 3 parameters of the pdmp concerned , and the assumptions used ( in subsection [ upper bound ] ) . in subsection",
    "[ 2.2 ] , some ergodicity results are stated uniformly over the class of functions previously defined .",
    "we explicitly construct an estimator @xmath26 of @xmath2 . in subsection",
    "[ 3.4 ] an upper bound for the squared - error loss is given in the main theorem [ upper bound2 ] .",
    "in [ simulation ] , we illustrate our result with simulations of a tcp process which could not been seen as a `` marked '' bacteria process , amongst others .",
    "finally , section [ 4 ] is reserved for the proofs . in subsection",
    "[ 4.1 ] we prove the ergodicity result of subsection [ 2.2 ] . subsection [ rate of convergence for the empirical measure ] presents the intermediate results needed in [ 4.3 ] to prove the major results given in subsection [ 3.4 ] .",
    "in general a pdmp is defined by its local characteristics , namely , the jump rate @xmath2 , the flow @xmath7 and the transition measure @xmath9 according to which the location of the process is chosen at the jump time . in this article , we consider a specific class of pdmp which includes the control of congestion tcp / ip used in communication networks ( v. dumas and al @xcite , v. guillemin and al .",
    "@xcite ) , for which the transition measure @xmath9 is a dirac mass function , which means that when the process jumps , the size after the jump is a deterministic function of its size before .",
    "more precisely ,    [ hypopdmp ]    * the flow @xmath27 is a one - parameter group of homeomorphisms : @xmath7 is @xmath28 , @xmath29 is an homeomorphism for each @xmath30 , satisfying the semigroup property : @xmath31 and @xmath32 is an @xmath28-diffeormorphism .",
    "* the jump rate @xmath33 is assumed to be a measurable function satisfying @xmath34 * @xmath35 is an increasing @xmath28-diffeomorphism and @xmath36 .",
    "given these three characteristics , it can be shown ( @xcite , pages 62 - 66 ) , that there exists a filtered probability space @xmath37 such that the motion of the process @xmath19 starting from a point @xmath38 may be constructed as follows . consider a random variable @xmath12 such that @xmath39 where for @xmath38 and @xmath40 @xmath41 if @xmath12 is equal to infinity , then the process @xmath42 follows the flow , i.e. for @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "otherwise let @xmath45 the trajectory of @xmath19 starting at @xmath10 , for @xmath46 $ ] , is given by @xmath47 inductively starting from @xmath48 , we now select the next inter - jump time @xmath49 and post - jump location @xmath50 in a similar way .",
    "this construction properly defines a strong markov process @xmath19 with jump times @xmath51 ( where @xmath52 ) .",

    "thanks to ( [ t1 ] ) , we get that @xmath57 using ( [ z1 ] ) , the monotonicity of @xmath58 and a simple change of variables , we get the transition probability of the markov chain @xmath53 :    @xmath59    where @xmath60^{-1}\\ ] ] and @xmath61 .",
    "statistical inference is based on the observation scheme : @xmath62 and asymptotics are considered when the number of jumps of the process , @xmath1 , goes to infinity .",
    "actually the simpler observation scheme : @xmath63 is sufficient .",
    "we want to bound from above the squared - loss error of our estimator over compact intervals @xmath64 of @xmath0 .",
    "we need to specify the local smoothness properties of @xmath2 over @xmath64 , together with general properties that ensure that the empirical measurements of the pdmp converge toward the invariant probability with an appropriate speed of convergence .",
    "so we have to impose technical assumptions on @xmath2 in particular near the origin and infinity .    for @xmath65 , a vector of positive constants @xmath66 , and two positive functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 such that",
