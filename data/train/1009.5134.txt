    "the quest for high superconducting transition temperatures @xmath0 led to a slow increase in the maximum observed @xmath0 from 4.2  k in hg in 1911 , which was the discovery of superconductivity itself by onnes , to 2223  k in thin films of the cubic a-15 structure compound @xmath1 as reported by gavaler et al .  in 1973 and 1974.@xcite oxides and non - transition metal compounds were not seriously considered by most researchers as contenders for high @xmath0 .",

    "[ structspinel ] , are both geometrically frustrated for antiferromagnetic ordering due to the triangular connectivity of the respective nearest neighbors .",
    "most 3@xmath21 transition metal spinel structure compounds become distorted at low temperatures , which can partially relieve the frustration .",
    "there are very few transition metal oxide spinel compounds that remain metallic and cubic at low temperatures .",
    "the intermediate - valent spinel compound @xmath8 is one of these and @xmath22 is another , where the formal oxidation state of both the ti ( @xmath23 ) and v ( @xmath24 ) is + 3.5 .",
    "this nonintegral valence state , together with the undistorted crystal structure , require both compounds to be metals to low temperatures .",
    "the discovery of superconductivity in @xmath8 came about in the following way . at about the middle of the period ( 19691975 ) when i was a graduate student at the university of california at san diego , my research advisor , bernd t. matthias , asked me to make a sample of li@xmath25 , which he and coworkers at bell laboratories , murray hill , nj , had recently ( 1972 ) reported to become superconducting at a high temperature of 1013  k for @xmath26.@xcite lithium is a very reactive alkali metal , so i asked a chemistry professor to make some powder of li@xmath25 that i could process further .",
    "his postdoc hari prakash , using wet chemical methods , provided me with a batch of amorphous li@xmath25 which , in retrospect , probably had a high surface area . in order to make a crystalline sample , i wanted to melt it in an arc - furnace ( like a commercial arc - welder , but in an inert argon atmosphere )",
    "this was certainly not an optimum way to crystallize the material !",
    "however , even so , i wanted to do this experiment , so i first poured some of the powder out of the bottle in air in order to make a pressed pellet , but the powder started to smoke !",
    "therefore i made the pellet as fast as possible and loaded it into the arc - furnace . when i tried to melt the pellet , the sample made a lot of smoke that filled up the arc - furnace because of the volatility of li and s , but it also made a melted round ball that was a beautiful dark blue color ( metals are usually silvery and do nt usually have colors ; pure bulk elemental os metal is light blue , though ) . then i measured pieces of the blue ball for superconductivity using ac susceptibility measurements and found that the sample became superconducting at 11  k. this seemed to confirm bernd s findings .",
    "but all was not as it seemed .",
    "my powder x - ray diffraction pattern of the sample contained lines that i could index as @xmath27 , and i subsequently found that the intensity of these lines correlated with the volume fraction of superconductivity in similarly prepared samples .",
    "then , as luck would have it , bernd had a famous crystallographer friend , willie zachariasen , who happened to be visiting bernd s lab at ucsd at the time .",
    "i pointed out to him the set of x - ray diffraction peaks that correlated with the volume fraction of superconductivity .",
    "after a couple of days analyzing the peaks , he figured out that the composition of the superconducting material in my samples was close to @xmath8 with a face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) normal - spinel structure .",
    "it turned out that the strongest lines in the pattern were at about the same positions as those for the different phase @xmath27 noted above . undoubtedly hari did provide me with pure li@xmath25 , but when i exposed it to air , it reacted with the air and oxidized before i could make it into a pellet . then when i subsequently arc - melted it in pure ar , part of the sample turned into @xmath8 which was superconducting at 11  k. furthermore , i later discovered that the metallic spinel structure compound @xmath8 transforms to a semiconducting ramsdellite structure compound with the same composition upon heating above 950  @xmath28c , and that the conversion of the structure to the spinel structure on cooling to below 950  @xmath28c is a slow process .",
    "apparently when the melted sample cooled in the arc - furnace , at least some of it converted to the low - temperature spinel crystal structure .",
    "the discovery of superconductivity in @xmath8 was thus pure serendipity .",
    "i subsequently learned how to synthesize @xmath8 in a rational way and further confirmed that the superconductivity arose from @xmath8 with the spinel structure at temperatures up to 13.7  k. r.  viswanathan at ucsd carried out heat capacity measurements on the initial samples and demonstrated that @xmath8 is a bulk superconductor .",
    "the first announcement of  high - temperature superconductivity in the li - ti - o ternary system \" was in 1973.@xcite i did my ph.d .",
    "thesis on the follow - up synthesis , structure , and properties of polycrystalline samples of @xmath8 and of the solid solution li@xmath29ti@xmath10o@xmath11.@xcite some of these studies were carried out in collaboration with bill mccallum , carlos luengo , brian maple , robert shelton and hermann adrian who were all also at ucsd at the time .",
    "before i worked on @xmath8 , it was known that there exists a complete solid solution of spinel - structure compounds from @xmath8 to @xmath30o_4}$ ] , which can be written li@xmath29ti@xmath10o@xmath11 with @xmath31.@xcite in this solid solution , some li substitutes for the ti on the octahedral sites of the structure . at the same time , the formal oxidation state of the ti changes from + 3.5 to + 4.0 .",
    "the compound with @xmath32 is a colorless nonmagnetic insulator .",
    "therefore there had to be a metal - to - insulator transition with increasing @xmath33 .",
    "as part of my thesis work , i investigated this issue and found a metal - insulator transition at @xmath34 with @xmath0 being nearly constant for @xmath35 .",
    "this suggested that if a metal - insulator transition occurred in a specific materials system , the potential for high @xmath0 superconductivity might be greatest for the metallic compound in that system with a composition closest to the metal - insulator boundary .",
    "i made a compilation of oxide and chalcogenide compounds and found that this correlation indeed held about 80% of the time .",
    "it was subsequently found to be applicable to the cuprate high-@xmath0 superconductors .",
    "this correlation is also mentioned in arthur sleight s commentary below .",
    "a summary of the literature on @xmath8 up to 1999 was given by moshopoulou.@xcite    before leaving the topic of @xmath8 , one might think that the very similar metallic normal spinel structure compound @xmath22 , which has the same beautiful dark blue color , would also be a superconductor .",
    "however , in 1973 , it was already known that @xmath22 was not superconducting above 4  k , and that this compound , despite being metallic , showed a curie - weiss temperature dependence to the magnetic susceptibility with a curie constant indicating that each v atom had a spin @xmath36 with a spectroscopic splitting factor @xmath37 .",
    "since my advisor bernd matthias was mainly interested in discovering new superconductors at ucsd , i did not pursue the properties of @xmath22 at that time .",
    "it was not until 1997 that my group at iowa state university discovered that @xmath22 is a very rare example of a @xmath21-electron heavy fermion compound , in collaboration with clayton swenson and ferdinando borsa s and alan goldman s groups at iowa state and with the groups of james jorgensen , brian maple and yasutomo uemura.@xcite",

    "i decided crystals were needed , and none have ever been reported .",
    "i grew some crystals . at first",

    "however , electrical measurements showed that the crystals were semiconducting with a rather high resistivity .",
    "i knew that bapbo@xmath5 was a very good conductor .",
    "so i thought there must be some sort of metal - insulator transition in the bapbo@xmath5babio@xmath5 solid solution , which had never been investigated .",
    "i first made 50/50 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "it was not metallic .",
    "so i then made @xmath47 , and it was metallic and superconducting .",

    "we were not set up for magnetic measurements appropriate for superconductors .",
    "but i gave a sample to a guy who measured magnetic susceptibility .",
    "he said it must be a superconductor because the sample jumped out of its holder when the temperature of zero resistivity was reached .",
    "i was confident of our results , and i did not want our paper to be reviewed by skeptics .",
    "so i sent it to a journal where an editor would communicate it.@xcite i then tried babio@xmath5kbio@xmath5 at that time , but only once and saw no superconductivity . ''",
    "`` i had previously worked on w and re oxides superconductors , and i did appreciate at that time that superconductivity frequently occurred in compositions that were close to a phase boundary between metallic and insulating properties .",
    "the actual value of @xmath0 in the ba(bi , pb)o@xmath5 system was a surprise to me .",
    "so i was not really looking for a new superconductor , but my search for a mi transition based on babio@xmath5 made this discovery inevitable . ''",
    "superconductivity was discovered in 1988 at temperatures up to around 22  k in the system ( ba@xmath9k@xmath4)bio@xmath5 by mattheiss et al.@xcite using a specific focused approach .",
    "several factors led to this discovery.@xcite first , the superconductivity at temperatures up to 13  k in the related perovskite system ba(pb@xmath9bi@xmath4)o@xmath5 described above was well - known .",
    "second , according to mattheiss , et al .",
    ", based on previous work , `` these results suggest that it should be possible to suppress the ordering waves [ that result in insulating behavior ] and extend the metallic regime in bapb@xmath9bi@xmath4o@xmath5 closer to the half - filled band condition ( babio@xmath5 ) where the electron - phonon interaction is a maximum , by leaving the conducting bi - o complex intact and instead doping substitutionally at the inactive ba donor sites . this situation , which is analogous to that in la@xmath10(ba , sr)@xmath4cuo@xmath11 , is expected to produce marginal stability and enhanced @xmath0 s . in earlier studies , a combination of k and pb doping in a @xmath48 sample has produced similar critical temperatures ( @xmath49  k ) but sharper transitions than those observed in pb - doped @xmath47 samples . in the present investigation",
    "we have carried out dc magnetization measurements on k - doped ba@xmath50k@xmath4bio@xmath5 samples with @xmath51.''@xcite this investigation resulted in superconducting onset temperatures up to about 22  k as noted above .",
    "cava and coworkers subsequently refined the synthesis procedures and obtained a superconducting onset temperature of 29.8  k in a single - phase cubic perovskite structure sample of ba@xmath52k@xmath53bio@xmath5 , thus firmly confirming the source of the superconductivity as the compound with the cubic perovskite structure.@xcite the onset temperature was determined by cava et al .  from a magnetization measurement of the meissner effect upon cooling the sample in an applied magnetic field of 19  oe .",
    "we note that direct meissner effect measurements such as this on other materials are often not informative or conclusive due to flux trapping effects that prevent the magnetic flux from escaping from the sample upon cooling below @xmath0 .",
