    "central to the field of molecular electronics are phenomena involving the interaction between the electron current and the internal degrees of freedom of the molecule investigated . in scanning tunnel microscopy ( stm ) @xcite the molecular vibrational modes ( phonons ) have been exploited to desorb or to move a molecule on a surface , paving the way for phonon assisted surface chemistry . at the same time , stm inelastic tunnelling spectroscopy uses the fingerprints of vibrations in the @xmath2-@xmath3 curve to probe the orientation and/or to identity molecules on surfaces @xcite . switching devices exploiting phonons have also been reported @xcite .    broadly speaking , in molecular devices phonons are important for two reasons .",
    "firstly , they play a role in transport@xcite by opening new conductance channels through which the itinerant electrons can propagate , and by suppressing the transmission of purely elastic channels @xcite . more dramatically , for large electron - phonon coupling the charge carriers become quasi - particles consisting of coupled electrons and phonons @xcite . secondly , from a technological point of view , phonons limit the efficiency of molecular devices because of energy dissipation .",
    "this causes heating , power loss and instability .",
    "transport experiments at the nano - scale are difficult to interpret since the atomically precise device geometry is rarely known .",
    "therefore one usually relies on atomistic simulation techniques in order to understand the results . for elastic transport ,",
    "when electron - phonon interaction is not considered and the electron - electron interaction is treated at the mean field level , methods of note for predicting the current flowing through devices include the non - equilibrium green function formalism ( negf ) @xcite and scattering theory ( st ) @xcite .",
    "some of these methods have been adapted to include electron - phonon interaction , notably an extension of scattering theory ( est)@xcite and the self consistent born approximation ( scba)@xcite within the negf formalism .",
    "in addition time - dependent methods for describing correlated electron - ion dynamics have been recently proposed@xcite .",
    "the focus of this paper is the scba .",
    "this is attractive from a practical point of view since it has moderate computational requirements and it has been used extensively for calculating transport properties of a number of different material systems @xcite . however , it is a perturbative approach appropriate only for weak electron - phonon ( e - p ) coupling .",
    "as the e - p coupling strength increases the scba will eventually breakdown , however it is unclear whether such breakdown is either sharp or smooth with the e - p coupling strength .",
    "our work explores this question in detail .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin by presenting the negf formalism for a two probe device@xcite , and by recalling the foundations of the scba .",
    "we then consider a 1d tight - binding model where the e - p interaction in the scattering region is described by the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh)@xcite hamiltonian .",
    "the parameters for the model hamiltonian are chosen for mimicking two systems which have been studied experimentally : @xmath1 molcules sandwiched between pt electrodes ( @xmath1-pt)@xcite and au monatomic chains@xcite comprising r atoms ( rc s ) .",
    "the parameters for @xmath1-pt are the same as those used by jean and sanvito @xcite , who previously employed exact scattering theory ( est ) to describe phononic effects .",
    "in contrast to the scba , est is valid for both strong and weak coupling and therefore it is a good benchmark for the scba .",
    "accordingly we compare the scba results directly with est over a range of different e - p couplings to establish the limit of validity for the scba and to investigate its breakdown .",
    "a two probe device consists of two crystalline electrodes attached on either side of a scattering region , which is in general a collection of atoms breaking the electrodes translational symmetry .",
    "the leads are also charge reservoirs , so that the device may be viewed as two charge reservoirs bridged by the central region .",
    "thermodynamically we characterise the left - hand side ( l ) and right - hand side ( r ) lead by defining their chemical potentials @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath5 , equilibrium is established and no current flows . when @xmath6 the system is dragged out of equilibrium , and net charge will move from the reservoir with the higher chemical potential across the central region to the reservoir of lower chemical potential in an attempt to re - establish equilibrium . if a battery is attached to the two reservoirs keeping @xmath7 ( @xmath3 is the bias and @xmath8 the electron charge ) the system can not return to equilibrium and will eventually reach a steady state with a constant current flow .    at the hamiltonian level",
    "the problem can be formulated by using a basis set comprising a linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) .",
    "it is convenient to write the hamiltonian of the semi - infinite periodic leads in term of principal layers ( pls ) @xcite .",
    "these are cells that repeat periodically and constructed in such a way that the interaction between pls extend only to nearest neighbours ( see figure [ generalsystem ] ) .        thus the @xmath9 matrices @xmath10 and @xmath11 describe respectively the interactions between pls and within a pl .",
    "the scattering region in general is described by @xmath12 basis functions .",
    "the @xmath13 matrix , @xmath14 , describes its internal interaction , while the matrices @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) contains the interaction between the pls of the leads adjacent to the scattering region and the scattering region itself .",
    "the entire system is thus described by the infinite tri - diagonal hamiltonian @xmath19 @xmath20 time reversal symmetry sets @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the retarded green function , @xmath24 associated to the entire system ( leads plus scattering region ) is defined as @xmath25{\\cal{g}}^\\mathrm{r}(\\omega ) = \\cal{i},}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the energy and @xmath28 is the infinite dimensional identity matrix .    for transport calculations however one does not need the green s function of the entire system but only that relative to the scattering region , @xmath29 , in presence of the leads",
    "this can be written as @xmath30^{-1}\\label{gm}\\;,\\ ] ] where the presence of the leads have been accounted via the introduction of the self - energies for the left- and right - hand side lead @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 is the @xmath34 identity matrix .",
    "the self energies are @xmath13 matrices defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the retarded _ surface _ green functions of the leads , namely the retarded green functions of the isolated semi - infinite leads evaluated at the pls adjacent to the scattering region .",
    "these are calculated by considering the retarded green function of the corresponding infinite system ( periodic ) and by applying appropriate boundary conditions@xcite .",
    "external bias voltage is introduced under the assumption that the leads are good metals maintaining local charge neutrality .",
    "the effect of a bias is therefore only that of shifting rigidly in energy the leads electronic structure , so that @xmath38    we now proceed to evaluate the non - equilibrium charge density in the scattering region and the two - probe current by using the negf scheme@xcite .",

    "the conductance @xmath56 in the linear response limit is @xmath57 while more generally at a given bias @xmath3 one has @xmath58      we now discuss the main concepts associated with introducing e - p scattering into the negf transport scheme . in general , inelastic scattering produces loss of phase coherence , similarly to what happens when an electron is absorbed by a reservoir .",
    "in fact one may think of inelastic processes as resulting from the coupling of the scattering region to a `` fictitious '' charge reservoir @xcite that does not exchange a net current .",
    "thus e - p interaction can be introduced via a self - energy @xmath59 and the retarded green function becomes @xmath60^{-1}\\:.\\label{grp}\\ ] ] the exact form for @xmath59 is unknown , however convenient approximations can be derived from the perturbative expansion over the e - p coupling strength @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider the scba where only the hartree and fock diagrams of the perturbative expansion are retained ( see figure [ feynman ] ) .",
    "this is equivalent to evaluating the first order diagrams at the interacting electronic green function .",

    "in addition , in figure [ biasrcoeff]b we plot the dominant coefficient @xmath218 for a small range of @xmath49 about @xmath185 at three different bias , @xmath213 , @xmath231 and @xmath232  volt . a clear result from figure [ biasrcoeff]a is that the presence of @xmath126 introduces a reduction of @xmath125 with bias not present at @xmath197 . for @xmath233 figure",
    "[ biasrcoeff]b shows that @xmath234 is a function of bias whose value increases as the bias increases .",
    "the difference between @xmath218 at @xmath213 and at finite @xmath3 explains the deviation below @xmath235 and also the origin of the peak above it .",
    "the discontinuity in @xmath183 for @xmath236 of figure [ h2fdfull]a is explained by the discontinuities observed in @xmath218 ( fig .",
    "[ biasrcoeff]b ) and in the current @xmath124 ( fig .",
    "[ biasrcoeff]c ) .",
    "in fact at @xmath197 , @xmath237 is single valued as long as @xmath225 . for @xmath224 instead @xmath238 has a parabolic shape symmetric about @xmath239 : the @xmath240 solution traces out the lower arm of the parabola and the @xmath236 solution follows the upper arm as @xmath0 increases . for @xmath241 , it is seen that the two solutions for @xmath218 are identical , and asymptotically approach the lower arm of the @xmath213 curve from below for @xmath242 .",
    "however , as @xmath49 is further increased the @xmath236 solution jumps discontinuously above zero and then asymptotically approaches the upper arm , again from below .",
    "the discontinuity in @xmath243 is determined by both the bias and the initial conditions .",
    "generally , it is found that such discontinuity occurs for lower bias first ; @xmath218 jumps discontinuously for @xmath231  volt before it does for @xmath232  volt .",
    "this explains the behaviour of the @xmath244 solution for @xmath124 in figure [ biasrcoeff]c which leads to a peak in its derivative ( the conductance @xmath125 ) and explains the discontinuity of @xmath183 .    we note that after the discontinuity in @xmath218 for @xmath241 , the two solutions are no longer symmetric about @xmath239 and do not converge to the @xmath213 solutions of either arm until @xmath245  ev /  .",
    "this is highlighted in figure [ biasrcoeff]d where @xmath201 for the two solutions is plotted in a range of @xmath49 just above @xmath235 at @xmath246  volt .",
    "such differences explain why @xmath183 is not independent of the initial conditions beyond the discontinuity and also the different curves observed for @xmath125 in figure [ h2fdfull]c .",
    "we make a final comment about the discontinuities seen in figure [ biasrcoeff]a .",
    "the value of @xmath0 at which these occur is dependent on the initial conditions as mentioned already .",
    "thus for a particular @xmath247 it may be possible to reach the upper solution at @xmath235 for all bias , so that @xmath218 has a parabolic shape for bias while being asymmetric about 0 .",
    "we have not observed this and regard @xmath235 as uniquely defined for @xmath213 only .",
    "by using the procedure outlined in section [ sec : num ] and the parameters of table [ systemparameters ] , the full scba is used to calculate the transport of the au rc s . in general",
    "we observe a behaviour similiar to that of the h@xmath176-pt system .        for 3c , 4c , 5c , and 6c a weak coupling regime is identified where the shift @xmath216 and the weighting coefficients are zero .",
    "a critical coupling strength @xmath235 for @xmath213 was discovered for each of the chains investigated with values @xmath249 ev /   respectively for 3c , 4c , 5c , and 6c .",
    "for weak coupling @xmath216 matches closely the values calculated in previous works@xcite . as an example , in figure [ diffc.8 ] we present @xmath125 and @xmath250 for 4c .",
    "it is seen that the modes symmetric with respect to the centre of the scattering region ( even numbered ) induce drops in @xmath125 at threshhold voltages corresponding to the energy of the modes . in general , only the symmetric modes are active in rc s containing an even number of atoms and conversely the rigid and anti - symmetric modes are active for an odd rc .        the transition from weak to strong coupling can be appreciated for the 4c by looking at the inset of figure [ diffc.8]b , where for @xmath190 two different initial conditions lead to two different @xmath216 . the 6c shows the same behaviour of the 4c , while the 3c and 5c show a single curve for @xmath216 due to the symmetry of the weighting coefficients in the strong regime . beyond @xmath235 , for all the rc s simulated @xmath125 is reduced to zero as @xmath49 increased and the shift @xmath216 rises to @xmath210 .",
    "finally we want to investigate further the existence of multiple solutions depending on the initial conditions in the self - consistent loops . as an example of",
    "how convergence is achieved in figure [ ic ] we show the coefficient @xmath251 as a function of the iteration number @xmath252 for the 4c plotted for a single bias @xmath253  volt and coupling 0.902  ev /   ( @xmath224 ) .",
    "a number of simulations were run with different initial conditions .",
    "the figure indicates the existence of two stable minima : simulations which start at @xmath236 ( dashed lines ) converge to the same positive final value , while simulations initialised with @xmath240 converge to the same @xmath254 value .",
    "we note that the minima are not symmetric about @xmath255 .",
    "the solution @xmath256 appears to be a minima in the weak coupling regime , but becomes unstable and evolves to a local maximum in the strong coupling regime .    in figure",
    "[ limitsandgrids ] @xmath257 is plotted versus the number of iterations @xmath252 for @xmath258 .",
    "this time we run different simulations in which the lower bound of the energy integration grid , eb , is changed .",
    "in particular we explore situations where eb is not below the lower band - edge of the leads , that for our choice of parameters lies at -2  ev ( see table [ systemparameters ] ) .",
    "the figure indicates that if @xmath259  ev @xmath260 converges to zero so that the sixth mode gives no contribution to @xmath126 . for @xmath261 @xmath260",
    "is nonzero , however the converged value differs for eb= -1.5  ev and eb= -2.0  ev , i.e. it is sensitive on the grid lower bound . finally for @xmath262 ev the bands of the leads",
    "are entirely included in the integral and @xmath260 converges to a value of approximately @xmath263  ev which is independent of our choice of eb . from this simple analysis",
    "it appears that cutting the integration grid can result in the erroneous suppression of the hartree self - energy , i.e. in a drastic underestimate of its contribution .",
    "this produces a fortuitous suppression of the scba breakdown , since the agreement between scba and est is usually improved when @xmath126 is neglected .",
    "finally we test the robustness of our integration method .",
    "figure [ transm6 ] shows the transmission coefficients @xmath264 for a 6c at a bias of @xmath265  mv where only the sixth mode is considered .",
    "we run two simulations . in the first case ,",
    "the full scba is used with the numerical parameters taken from table [ systemparameters ] and initial condition @xmath266 .     for a 6c simulation where only the sixth mode of energy @xmath267  mev is included .",
    "the curves show results obtained when @xmath268 is calculated using the simpson s rule ( @xmath269 in the legend ) or the contour method ( @xmath270 in the legend ) . ]    in the second case , the integration method outlined in section [ subsec : sc ] is replaced by simpson s rule along the real axis .",
    "the integration range used is [ -3.093,0.1 ]  ev with a grid fineness @xmath271  ev . the hartree self - consistent loop is started with @xmath272 and finished when @xmath273 ( this tolerance was also used in the first case ) .",
    "all other parameters of the calculations are identical in the two cases .",
    "the figure shows that the two numerical methods produce the same @xmath264 , specifically in the range of applied bias shown in the inset .",
    "by using a simple 1d tight binding model we have investigated the breakdown of the scba as a function of the e - p coupling strength @xmath139 .",
    "we have identified two regimes . in the weak coupling regime",
    "there is a unique solution for both @xmath268 and @xmath169 , independently of the initial conditions .",
    "in particular the hartree self - energy is small and has little effect on the final conductance . in this weak coupling regime",
    "the characteristic conductance drops at voltages corresponding to the various phonon energies compare well with those calculated with the est method .    as the coupling parameter @xmath49 is increased beyond some critical value @xmath185 a sharp transition to the strong coupling regime",
    "occurs . in this limit",
    "the self - consistent @xmath268 becomes unstable with respect to the initial conditions and exhibits multiple values for the same voltage .",
    "this results in a conductance that sharply deviates from that obtained with the exact est .",
    "such a sharp transition suggests a breakdown of the scba , indicating that the electron - phonon interaction can not be treated perturbatively for @xmath190 .",
    "interestingly such a breakdown is suppressed when the hartree self - energy is neglected completely from the calculation , as routinely done in practice .",
    "our results however set a warning to quantitative calculations based on e - p parameters extracted from density functional theory .",
    "for these , no information is available on whether or not the obtained e - p coupling strength is either below or above the critical value for the scba to breakdown .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , one rarely knows whether the scba is applicable .",
    "we acknowledge the financial support of ircset and thank ivan rungger for all his advice and useful discussions .",
