    "one of the most important fundamental biological processes is a formation of a multi - cellular organism from a set of genetically identical cells . the central role in this process",
    "is played by morphogens , which are signaling molecules that control the fate of biological cells @xcite .",
    "it is now widely accepted that these signaling molecules develop non - uniform concentration profiles , called morphogen gradients , that interact with embryo cells .",
    "the idea behind the morphogen gradients is that different concentrations of signaling molecules turn on different genes , leading to complex patterning observed in developed multi - cellular systems @xcite .",
    "a significant progress in understanding of morphogen gradients and how they function has been achieved in recent years when many quantitative investigations have appeared @xcite . however , despite these advances , mechanisms of the formation of signaling molecules profiles remain not fully understood @xcite .    several theoretical ideas were presented to explain the complex processes associated with the development of morphogen gradients @xcite .",
    "the dominating view is based on a so - called synthesis - diffusion - degradation ( sdd ) model @xcite . according to this approach , the production of signaling molecules starts at the specific localized region of the embryo , then signaling molecules diffuse along the cells .",
    "in addition , with equal probability they can be degraded after binding to specific receptors on the cells . as a result",
    ", exponentially decaying concentration profiles are developed at long times . since qualitatively similar behavior",
    "is observed in many experimental systems , the sdd models have been widely utilized for understanding morphogen gradients @xcite .",
    "the majority of investigations of morphogen gradients formation that use the sdd models postulate that the signaling molecules are produced from a sharply localized source @xcite . however , experimental observations suggest that in many biological systems the production region of the morphogens is delocalized @xcite .",
    "morphogens are protein molecules that are synthesized from the corresponding rna molecules .",
    "so the production of these signaling molecules to a large degree is determined by the distribution of the corresponding rna molecules . for one of the most intensely studied system , the formation of bicoid morphogen in early drosophila embryo , it is known that the maternal rna molecules are distributed over the region of size 30 - 50 @xmath0 m , while the total length of the embryo is of order of 400 @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "obviously , in this case the production area can not be defined as sharply localized .",
    "this raises many queries on the role of the source production in the developing morphogen gradients .",
    "specific questions include : why the synthesis of signaling molecules is delocalized , why it is not produced over the whole embryo , and how the morphogen gradient depends on the spatial distribution of the source and on the synthesis rate ? at the same time , although some of these issues were discussed , a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the delocalization of signaling molecules synthesis is not available @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a theoretical investigation on the role of source production in the development of morphogen gradients . a theoretical approach for analyzing the formation of signaling molecules concentration profiles with arbitrary delocalization length and production rates is developed .",
    "our method is based on discrete - state stochastic models that can be explicitly solved for arbitrary sets of parameters .",
    "we investigate several possible cases of the formation of signaling molecules concentration profiles to analyze the role of the synthesis of the signaling molecules .",
    "it is shown that the production might have a strong impact on the development of morphogen gradients .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , a general discrete - state stochastic sdd model with an arbitrary source distribution",
    "is presented and analyzed . in section 3 , three different distributions",
    "are explicitly analyzed as illustrative examples . in this section",
    "the stationary profiles and local accumulation times are calculated .",
    "finally , in section 4 , the important biophysical implications of the presented results are discussed and conclusions are given .",
    "we start our analysis by considering a general discrete - state stochastic sdd model in one dimension as illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "our system is semi - infinite .",
    "it is assumed that the synthesis of the morphogen particles is taking place only in the interval consisting of @xmath1 sites : see figure 1 .",
    "inside the source region , signalling molecules are produced at any site @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) with a corresponding rate @xmath4 , and the total production rate is equal to @xmath5 .",
    "from any site morphogens can jump to nearest neighbors left or right sites with a rate @xmath6 .",
    "the particles might be degraded at any site with a rate @xmath7 .",
    "one can define a function @xmath8 as the probability to find the morphogen at the site @xmath9 at time @xmath10 if the particle can only be produced at the site @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",

    "here we use the fact that @xmath15 for @xmath16 , and it is zero otherwise .    at long times we have @xmath17 , and these equations",

    "particles can also diffuse along the lattice to the neighboring sites with a rate @xmath6 , or they might be degraded with a rate @xmath7 . ]",
    "this approach is very useful since it allows us to obtain the total concentration profiles from all producing sites using a kind of a superposition principle . in other words , the total probability @xmath30 of finding the particle at site @xmath31 at time",
    "@xmath10 can be expressed as a sum of the probabilities @xmath8 with production at the specific site @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this is because the synthesis processes at each site are independent of each other .",
    "the general equations for concentration profiles are given by    @xmath32    the explicit expressions can be easily obtained by employing equations ( [ steady_profile1 ] ) and ( [ steady_profile2 ] ) .",
    "one of the main goals of morphogen gradients is to transfer the information .",
    "most probably , it can be done well if the system is close to the stationary conditions .",
    "then the important characteristics of morphogen gradients are times needed to achieve the steady state at specific spatial locations .",
    "these times are known as local accumulation times ( lat ) , and a theoretical framework for computing these quantities has been developed recently @xcite .",
    "it can be done utilizing local relaxation functions which are defined as @xmath33 the physical meaning of these functions is that they represent the relative distance to the stationary state : at @xmath34 the distance is one , while at steady state it is equal to zero . the explicit formulas for the local accumulation time can be derived then via laplace transformations of the local relaxation function , @xmath35 @xcite , @xmath36",
    "our approach allows us to analyze the formation of morphogen gradients for arbitrary length of the production region and for arbitrary production rates . to explain it better , we illustrate the method by doing explicit calculations for three different production scenarios , which might be relevant for the morphogen gradients formation in real cellular conditions .      as a first example , we start with the case when the source of signaling molecules is localized at the site @xmath37 , @xmath38 from equations ( [ steady_profile1 ] ) and ( [ steady_profile2 ] ) we directly obtain @xmath39,\\ ] ] @xmath40.\\ ] ] for @xmath41 , as expected , we recover the results obtained earlier @xcite , @xmath42 these expressions indicate that the signaling molecules profiles are exponentially decaying functions of the distance from the source for @xmath43 , and the decay length , @xmath44 , is independent of the production rate @xmath45 .",

    "one can see that the local accumulation times for the sharply localized source linearly grow with the distance from the source .",
    "this can be explained by invoking the idea that the degradation acts as an effective potential that pushes the signaling molecules away from the source @xcite , leading to effectively driven diffusion of morphogens in the system .      in another example",

    "this distribution can be represented as follows , @xmath49 in this case , the synthesis rates are the same for all production sites . applying equation ( [ super ] ) , one can obtain explicit expressions for the stationary profiles .",

    "the concentration of signaling molecules is large and almost constant in the production region , and then it exponentially decays outside of the synthesis area .",
    "the transition between these two regimes depends on parameters of the system .",
    "decreasing the diffusion and/or increasing the degradation rate makes this crossover sharper .",
    "in addition , the transition is more abrupt when the production length @xmath1 is much larger than the decay length @xmath53 ( see figure 2 where @xmath54 is utilized ) , while for comparable @xmath1 and @xmath53 ( see figure 3 where @xmath55 is utilized ) the concentration profile decays more smoothly .",
    "it is interesting to analyze the behavior of the profiles in the asymptotic limit of very large production intervals , @xmath56 , @xmath57 this corresponds to the case when the morphogens are synthesized all over the embryo with the same production rates .",
    "as expected , the concentration profile becomes uniform , and this is the reason why there is no dependence on the position @xmath9 in this equation .",
    "obviously , the morphogen gradient can not be established in such systems , and this is not a realistic situation for biological development .",

    "the normalized concentration profiles for exponentially decaying production along the semi - indite interval ( @xmath72 ) are plotted in figures 2 and 3 .",

    "the local accumulation times increase with the distance from the origin , as was found for other production scenarios of morphogen gradients considered in this work .",
    "the lat growth is mostly linear since our arguments about the effective potential due to degradation still can be applied .",
    "but what is different from other production mechanisms is the fact that these times are usually much smaller , especially at large distances from the origin ( larger than @xmath1 or @xmath64 ) .",
    "this can be understood if we recall that main contribution to the local accumulation times at given spatial position is due to the first - passage ( arrival ) times to this location starting from the source region @xcite . in the exponentially distributed production of signaling molecules along the semi - infinite interval",
    "the source is everywhere , so that the contribution of the arrival times is mostly negligible .",

    "it allows us to test the effect of the production in systems with arbitrary source lengths and synthesis rates by calculating stationary profiles and the times to achieve the stationary concentrations at specific locations . by analyzing several different systems we found that the spatial distributions of the sources and the production speeds have a strong effect in the development of morphogen gradients .    to understand the role of the production one might recall that there are two main requirements for successful function of the morphogen gradients in the biological systems @xcite",
    "the first one is to deliver the information to as many as possible embryo cells about their future fates .",
    "this can be done if observable concentrations of signaling molecules can be found as far as possible from the source .",
    "the second function is to ensure that different genes can be controllably turned on in the neighboring embryo cells .",
    "this can be accomplished by producing sharp boundaries in the concentration profiles of signaling molecules at specific locations .",
    "our analysis suggests that the morphogen gradients produced with the single localized sources generally are not able to satisfy these requirements . at the same time , the morphogen gradients developed from the delocalized sources with various synthesis rates are capable to do all these tasks successfully .",
    "furthermore , the presented theoretical method provides a simple physical - chemical explanation on the role of delocalizations in the formation of signaling molecules concentration profiles .",
    "the delocalization effectively leads to faster diffusion along the productions regions , and it also shortens the arrival times to specific locations . as a result , the range of morphogen gradients with delocalized sources increases , while the times to reach the stationary states at specific locations become smaller .",
    "all of these properties make the morphogen gradients more efficient and robust . at the same , increasing the production area to the whole embryo",
    "is not reasonable since it will be difficult to sustain the non - uniform concentration profiles .",
    "although our theoretical approach gives a clear physical picture on the effect of production in the development of morphogen gradients , one should note that our model is oversimplified .",
    "it neglects many crucial factors and processes in the biological development such as a three - dimensional nature of the embryo , inhomegeneity and complex cooperative mechanisms in the degradation , as well as variable mechanical responses of the embryo cells .",
    "it will be critically important to test the proposed theoretical picture in experimental studies and in more advanced theories .",

    "<S> successful biological development via spatial regulation of cell differentiation relies on action of multiple signaling molecules that are known as morphogens . </S>",
    "<S> it is now well established that signaling molecules create non - uniform concentration profiles , morphogen gradients , that activate different genes , leading to patterning in the developing embryos . </S>",
    "<S> the current view of the formation of morphogen gradients is that it is a result of complex reaction - diffusion processes that include the strongly localized production , diffusion and uniform degradation of signaling molecules . </S>",
    "<S> however , multiple experimental studies also suggest that the production of morphogen in many cases is delocalized . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a theoretical method that allows us to investigate the role of the delocalization in the formation of morphogen gradients . </S>",
    "<S> the approach is based on discrete - state stochastic models that can be solved exactly for arbitrary production lengths and production rates of morphogen molecules . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that the delocalization might have a strong effect on mechanisms of the morphogen gradient formation . </S>",
    "<S> the physical origin of this effect is discussed . </S>"
