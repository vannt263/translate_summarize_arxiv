    "we will study nuclear fusion rates of identical nuclei in dense stellar matter .",
    "this problem is of utmost importance for understanding the structure and evolution of stars of various types . despite the efforts of many authors the theoretical reaction rates are still rather uncertain , especially at high densities .",
    "the uncertainties have two aspects .",
    "the first one is related to _ nuclear physics _ and is concerned with the proper treatment of _ nuclear _ interaction transitions ( conveniently described in terms of the astrophysical factor @xmath0 ) . the other issue is associated with aspects of _ plasma physics _ and concerns the proper description of coulomb barrier penetration in a high density many - body system .",
    "we will analyze both aspects and illustrate the results taking the carbon fusion reaction as an example .",
    "considerable experimental effort has been spent on the study of low energy fusion reactions such as @xmath1c+@xmath1c , to investigate the impact on the nucleosynthesis , energy production and time scale of late stellar evolution .",
    "nevertheless , it has been difficult to develop a global and reliable reaction formalism to extrapolate the energy dependence of the fusion cross section into the stellar energy range .",
    "the overall energy dependence of the cross section is determined by the coulomb - barrier tunnel probability .",
    "one goal of the present work is to apply the so paulo potential model to provide a general description of the stellar fusion processes .",
    "this model does not contain any free parameter and represents a powerful tool to predict average low energy cross sections for a wide range of fusion reactions , as long as the density distribution of the nuclei involved in the reaction can be determined . in this context",
    "we also seek to introduce a phenomenological formalism for a generalized reaction rate to describe all the regimes of nuclear burning in a one - component plasma ion system . in this paper",
    "we want to demonstrate the applicability of the method on the specific example of @xmath1c+@xmath1c , to evaluate the reliability and uncertainty range of the proposed formalism through the comparison with the available low energy data . in a subsequent publication",
    "we want to extend the model to multi - ion systems with the aim of simulating a broad range of heavy - ion nucleosynthesis scenarios from thermonuclear burning in hot stellar plasma , to pycnonuclear burning in high density crystalline stellar matter .",
    "carbon burning represents the third phase of stellar evolution for massive stars ( @xmath4 ) ; it follows helium burning that converts he - fuel to @xmath1c via the triple @xmath5 process .",
    "carbon burning represents the first stage during stellar evolution determined by heavy - ion fusion processes ( e.g. , ref .",
    "the most important reaction during the carbon burning phase is the @xmath1c+@xmath1c fusion @xcite ; additional processes can be @xmath1c+@xmath6o and @xmath6o+@xmath6o , depending on the @xmath1c/@xmath6o abundance ratio which is determined by the @xmath1c(@xmath7)@xmath6o reaction rate @xcite .",
    "the most important reaction branches are @xmath1c(@xmath1c,@xmath5)@xmath8ne ( @xmath9=4.617 mev ) and @xmath1c(@xmath1c,@xmath10)@xmath11na ( @xmath9=2.241 mev ) .",
    "carbon burning in evolved massive stars takes place at typical densities @xmath12 g  @xmath3 and temperatures @xmath13  k.    carbon burning is also crucial for type ia supernovae .",
    "these supernova explosions are driven by carbon ignition in cores of accreting massive co white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the burning process proceeds from the carbon ignition region near the center of a white dwarf by detonation or deflagration through the entire white dwarf body . the ignition conditions and time scale",
    "are defined by the @xmath1c+@xmath1c reaction rate , typically , at @xmath14  k and @xmath15  g  @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "depending on the @xmath6o abundance , other fusion reactions may also contribute .",
    "for these high densities the reaction cross sections are affected by strong plasma screening , which reduces the repulsive coulomb barrier between interacting @xmath1c or @xmath6o nuclei ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ; also see section [ fusion ] ) .",
    "explosive carbon burning in the crust of accreting neutron stars has recently been proposed as a possible trigger and energy source for superbursts @xcite . in this scenario",
    "small amounts of carbon ( 3%10% ) , which have survived in the preceding rp - process phase during the thermonuclear runaway , ignite after the rp - process ashes are compressed by accretion to a density @xmath16 g  @xmath3 .",
    "the ignition of a carbon flash requires an initial temperature @xmath17  k , triggering a photodisintegration runaway of the rp - process ashes after a critical temperature @xmath18 k is reached @xcite . for these scenarios ,",
    "carbon burning proceeds in the _ thermonuclear _ regime with strong plasma screening ( see section [ fusion ] for details ) .    at high densities and/or low temperatures",
    "the thermonuclear reaction rate formalism is insufficient since the fusion process is mainly driven by the high density conditions in stellar matter ( sections [ fusion ] and [ carbonburn ] ) .",
    "this is particularly important for nuclear fusion in the deeper layers of the crust of an accreting neutron star @xcite . at sufficiently high @xmath19 and low @xmath20 nuclei form a crystalline lattice .",
    "neighboring nuclei may penetrate the coulomb barrier and fuse owing to zero - point vibrations in their lattice sites . in this _ pycnonuclear _ burning regime the reaction rate depends mainly on the density and is nearly independent of temperature ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "pycnonuclear burning regimes may not be limited to carbon induced fusion reactions only , but may be driven by a broad range of fusion reactions between stable and neutron rich isotopes @xcite .    in the following section [ sfactor ] ,",
    "we discuss the theory of fusion cross sections and calculate the astrophysical @xmath0-factor for carbon burning in the framework of a generalized parameter - free potential model . in section [ fusion ]",
    "we study the coulomb barrier problem for identical nuclei , and propose an expression for the reaction rate which describes all the regimes of nuclear burning in a dense one - component plasma of atomic nuclei . in section [ carbonburn ]",
    "we analyze , for illustration , the main features of @xmath1c burning from high temperature gaseous or liquid plasma to high density crystalline matter .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "nuclear reactions are possible after colliding nuclei tunnel through the coulomb barrier . recently ,",
    "a parameter - free model for the real part of the nuclear interaction ( so paulo potential ) based on nonlocal quantum effects was developed @xcite . in previous work @xcite ,",
    "this model was applied to the study of fusion processes using the barrier penetration ( bp ) formalism for about 2500 cross section data , corresponding to approximately 165 different systems . within the nonlocal model , the bare interaction @xmath21 is connected with the folding potential @xmath22 , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the speed of light",

    "( [ fold ] ) corresponds to the zero - range approach for the folding potential , which is equivalent @xcite to the more usual procedure of using the m3y effective nucleon - nucleon interaction with the nucleon densities of the nuclei .",
    "the advantage in adopting the so paulo potential to describe the fusion cross section relies on the fact that no additional parameter is necessary once the density distribution of the participating nuclei has been determined .",
    "the model is therefore a good choice for a generalized treatment of low energy heavy - ion fusion reactions .",
    "there are several ways to determine the nuclear density distribution @xcite .",
    "density functional theories ( dft ) provide for example a successful description of many nuclear ground state properties , in particular , of charge distributions in the experimentally known region . since these theories are universal in the sense that their parameter sets are carefully adjusted and valid all over the periodic table , one can expect that they also yield reliable predictions for nuclei far from stability .",
    "non - relativistic density functionals , such as the skyrme or gogny functional , have been widely used in the literature . in recent years",
    ", relativistic density functionals have played an increasingly important role since they provide a fully consistent description of the spin - orbit splitting .",
    "this is of greatest importance for nuclei far from stability .",
    "the spin - orbit splitting determines the shell structure , the most basic ingredient in any microscopic theory of finite nuclei .",
    "the results obtained with relativistic functionals are in very good agreement with experimental data , throughout the periodic table , despite having a smaller number of adjustable parameters in comparison with the non - relativistic case .",
    "best known is the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov theory @xcite , which includes pairing correlations with finite range pairing forces .",
    "it provides a unified description of mean - field and pairing correlations in nuclei .",
    "these functionals contain a strong density dependence , either through non - linear coupling terms between the meson fields ( e.g. , in the lagrangians with the parameter sets nl2 @xcite and nl3 @xcite ) , or by using an explicit density dependence for the meson - nucleon vertices ( e.g. , in the parameter sets dd - me1 @xcite and dd - me2 @xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider only spherical nuclear shapes .",
    "pairing correlations are in principle included , but they vanish for the @xmath1c nucleus . in fig .",
    "[ fig - dens ] we compare the calculated densities with experimental data @xcite .",
    "the rhb calculations are in good agreement with surface properties best described by the nl2 , dd - me1 , and dd - me2 effective interactions .    to apply the bp model for calculating fusion cross sections one needs the effective potential defined as a sum of the coulomb , nuclear and centrifugal components : @xmath34 following the bp model one can associate the fusion cross section with the particle flux transmitted through the barrier , @xmath35 it is important to point out that the sum in eq .",

    "( [ eff_pot ] ) . for @xmath36-waves with effective barrier heights",
    "@xmath38 , the shape of the effective potential can be approximated by a parabola with curvature defined as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the barrier radius . in such cases ,",

    "the wkb method gives values for the transmission coefficients which are quite different from those of the hill - wheeler formula .",
    "in this case , we define the barrier curvature by connecting eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) : @xmath47 the overall results provided by the bp model are in very good agreement with the fusion data for energies above the s - wave barrier height . for light systems",
    "@xmath48 the model also shows very good agreement with fusion data at sub - barrier energies @xcite .",
    "therefore , the use of the bp model in calculating the fusion cross section at energies of astrophysical interest for the @xmath1c+@xmath1c system is entirely justified .",
    "historically , reaction cross sections @xmath49 at very low energies , typical for astrophysical conditions , have been expressed in terms of the astrophysical @xmath0-factor ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the usual gamow parameter .",
    "considerable efforts have been made over the last decades to measure the @xmath1c+@xmath1c fusion cross section at very low energies @xcite .",
    "the experimentally determined @xmath0-factors are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for reaction rate calculations the experimental @xmath0-factor needs to be extrapolated towards the stellar energy range , the gamow window , which depends sensitively on the temperature and density conditions of the stellar environment .",
    "the typical range of energy @xmath25 for thermonuclear carbon burning , in the center - of - mass reference , varies from 1 to 4 mev . for pycnonuclear carbon burning in",
    "the neutron star crusts the energies can be as low as 10 kev .",
    "large discrepancies between the different experimental results at low energies complicate a reliable extrapolation of @xmath52 towards such low @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0-factor shows pronounced resonant structures , presumably resulting from quasimolecular doorway states .",
    "theoretical calculations of @xmath52 using the effective interactions nl2 , nl3 , dd - me1 , dd - me2 agree reasonably well , within a factor @xmath53 3.5 in the limit @xmath25 @xmath54 0 ( fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the resonant behavior of the data can not be described with the bp calculations because the effects of nuclear structure were neglected .",
    "however , an average description of the data ( neglecting resonant oscillations ) for the sub - barrier region ( @xmath25 @xmath55 6.0 mev ) is reproduced satisfactorily .",
    "such a description of an average @xmath0-factor is quite sufficient since the reaction rate formalism relies on the average @xmath0-factor behavior over the entire gamow range .    in this context",
    "it is important to emphasize that the main purpose of this paper is not to investigate the oscillations in the @xmath1c+@xmath1c fusion excitation function . in order to reproduce the resonances",
    "we could , for example , use the concept of internal and barrier waves based on a semiclassical description @xcite or adopt the r - matrix formalism ( e.g. , michaud and vogt @xcite ) .",
    "however , neither theoretical approach would allow us to extrapolate with confidence the fusion cross section to the energy region of astrophysical interest .    in order to calculate the carbon burning rate ,",
    "we use the values of @xmath52 obtained on the basis of the well established nl2 effective interaction . as one",
    "can see from fig .",
    "[ fig - dens ] , the @xmath1c density distribution obtained using the parameter set nl2 can describe satisfactorily the surface properties , which is the most important region for the fusion process at low energies .",
    "the values of @xmath52 calculated at @xmath56 mev can be fitted by an analytic expression @xmath57 where the center - of - mass energy @xmath25 is expressed in mev .",
    "the formal maximum fit error , 16% , occurs at @xmath58 mev .",
    "however , let us bear in mind that the values of @xmath52 provided by the nl2 model and given by eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) are actually uncertain within a factor of @xmath59 .    with the aim of investigating the validity of our assumption for the real part of the nuclear interaction , we performed an optical model ( om ) analysis of the @xmath1c+@xmath1c elastic scattering data at energies around and slightly above the coulomb barrier @xcite .",
    "we defined the imaginary part of the optical potential , which accounts for the nuclear absorption process , as @xmath60 where @xmath21 is described by eq .",
    "( [ nuc_pot ] ) and @xmath61 = 0.78 was determined by adjusting thirty elastic scattering angular distributions corresponding to seven different heavy - ion systems and measured in a very wide energy range @xcite .",
    "figure  [ elas ] illustrates a comparison between our om analysis and five elastic scattering angular distribution data of the @xmath1c+@xmath1c system .",
    "as one can note , it is possible to obtain a reasonable description of the data by adopting the so paulo potential to account for the real part of the nuclear interaction , combined with a simple model to describe the imaginary part of the optical potential .",
    "this means that both elastic scattering and fusion processes can be described by the same real part of the nuclear interaction , which has been well accounted by the so paulo potential , eq .",
    "( [ nuc_pot ] ) . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , details on the absorption part of the interaction are not very important for describing the elastic scattering data , which allows us to get reasonable estimates for the @xmath1c+@xmath1c system .",
    "further experiments at lower energies are necessary to confirm the validity of the predicted @xmath1c+@xmath1c @xmath0-factor and its impact on the reaction rate .",
    "however , the @xmath0-factor is not the only uncertainty for a reliable description of the @xmath1c+@xmath1c fusion process in stellar matter .",
    "the reaction rates are also uncertain because of the problems in calculating the probability of coulomb barrier penetration in a dense many - body environment",
    ". we shall discuss these problems in section [ fusion ] and show that the associated uncertainties are higher than the current uncertainties in the values of @xmath52 .",
    "in the following we will turn our attention to the plasma physics aspects of nuclear burning in dense matter .",
    "we will focus on the formalism of fusion reactions between identical nuclei @xmath62 in the wide domain of temperatures @xmath20 and densities @xmath19 , characteristic for the range of stellar environments outlined above .    as an example , we consider the @xmath1c+@xmath1c reaction in stellar matter at conditions displayed in the @xmath63 phase diagram in fig .  [",
    "fig : diag ] . under these conditions ,",
    "carbon is fully ionized ( either by electron pressure and/or by high temperature ) and immersed in an almost uniform electron background .",
    "the electrons are typically strongly degenerate ; their degeneracy temperature @xmath64 is shown in the figure .",
    "the state of ions ( nuclei ) is determined by the coulomb coupling parameter @xmath65 , where @xmath66^{1/3}$ ] is the ion - sphere radius and @xmath67 is the number density of ions ; the boltzmann constant is set @xmath68 . if @xmath69 ( which happens at @xmath70 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] ) , the ions constitute a boltzmann gas , while at higher @xmath71 they constitute a strongly coupled coulomb liquid .",
    "the gas transforms smoothly into the liquid , without any phase transition . at small @xmath20 ( large @xmath71 )",
    "the liquid can solidify . in the density range displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] , the solidification occurs at @xmath72 , where @xmath73 ( e.g. , de witt et al .",
    "the important measure of quantum effects in ion motion is provided by the ion plasma frequency @xmath74 or the associated ion plasma temperature @xmath75 ( @xmath76 being the ion mass ) . as a rule",
    ", the quantum effects are strongly pronounced at @xmath20 below @xmath77 .",
    "figure [ fig : diag ] shows that the ion system can have very different properties , depending on @xmath20 and @xmath19 . as a result , there are five qualitatively different regimes of nuclear burning in dense matter ( salpeter and van horn @xcite ) . these are ( 1 ) the classical thermonuclear regime ; ( 2 ) the thermonuclear regime with strong plasma screening ; ( 3 ) the thermo - pycnonuclear regime ; ( 4 ) the thermally enhanced pycnonuclear regime ; and ( 5 ) the zero - temperature pycnonuclear regime .",
    "the regimes differ mainly in the character of the coulomb barrier penetration of reacting nuclei",
    ". the penetration can be greatly complicated by coulomb fields of ions which surround the reacting nuclei .",
    "these fields are fluctuating and random ( e.g. , alastuey and jancovici @xcite ) .",
    "a strict solution of the barrier penetration problem should imply the calculation of the tunneling probability in a random potential , with subsequent averaging over an ensemble of random potentials .",
    "this program has not been fully realized so far .",
    "the exact theory should take into account a range of effects which can be subdivided ( somewhat conventionally ) into classical and quantum ones .",
    "the classical effects are associated with classical motion of plasma ions and with related structure of coulomb plasma fields ( including spatial and temporal variability of these fields ) .",
    "the quantum effects manifest themselves in ion motion ( e.g. , zero - point ion vibrations ) , quantum `` widths '' of ion trajectories during coulomb barrier penetration , and quantum statistics of reacting nuclei .",
    "the effects of quantum statistics are usually small due to the obvious reason that quantum tunneling lengths are typically much larger than nuclear radii .",
    "the smallness of these effects has been confirmed by ogata @xcite in path - integral monte carlo ( pimc ) simulations .",
    "the reaction rates in the classical thermonuclear regime are well known ( e.g. , fowler , caughlan , and zimmerman @xcite ) ; they have been tested very successfully by the theory and observations of the evolution of normal stars",
    ". this theory will be only shortly reviewed in the following section .",
    "the reaction rates in other regimes have been calculated by a number of authors in different approximations .",
    "in the following we summarize the main results published after the seminal paper by salpeter and van horn @xcite ( see that paper for references to earlier works ) .",
    "let us stress that the reaction rate is a rapidly varying function of plasma parameters . in the most important density - temperature domain it varies over tens orders of magnitude ( section [ carbonburn ] ) .",
    "in this situation , a very precise calculation of the reaction rate is very difficult but not required for many applications .",
    "the classical thermonuclear regime takes place at sufficiently high @xmath20 and low @xmath19 so that the ions constitute a boltzmann gas ( @xmath78 , fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] ) .",
    "the tunnel probability ( penetrability ) through the coulomb barrier depends on the energy of the interacting ions ; the main contribution to the reaction rate comes from ion collisions with energies approximately equal to the gamow peak energy @xmath79 ( that is much higher than @xmath20 ) .",
    "this regime is typical for all nuclear burning stages in `` normal '' stars ( from the main sequence to pre - supernovae ) .",
    "the thermonuclear reaction rate is expressed by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the gamow peak energy and @xmath82 is the parameter which characterizes the penetrability @xmath83 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath84 can be rewritten as @xmath85 now the reaction rate can be presented as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a convenient dimensional factor , @xmath88 is the exponential function , and @xmath89 is the pre - exponent : @xmath90 the classical thermonuclear reaction rate decreases exponentially with decreasing @xmath20 .",
    "the thermonuclear regime with strong plasma screening operates in a colder and denser plasma ( @xmath91 ) , where ions constitute a strongly coupled classical coulomb system ( liquid or solid ) .",
    "the majority of ions in such a system are confined in deep coulomb potential wells ( @xmath92 ) . the main contribution into the reaction rate comes from a small amount of higher - energy , unbound ions with @xmath93 from the tail of the boltzmann distribution .",
    "the plasma screening effects are produced by surrounding plasma ions and simplify close approaches of the reacting nuclei , required for a successful coulomb tunneling .",
    "this enhances the reaction rate with respect to that given by eqs .",
    "( [ rth ] ) and ( [ exth ] ) .",
    "the enhancement has been studied by a number of authors , beginning with salpeter @xcite ; it can reach many orders of magnitude .",

    "note that according to simple estimates ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) typical tunneling lengths of reacting ions in the thermonuclear regime ( where @xmath104 ) are considerably smaller than the ion sphere radius @xmath105 , and typical tunneling times are much smaller than the plasma oscillation period @xmath106 .",
    "this justifies the assumption of almost constant and static plasma potential during a tunneling event .",

    "the ignition curve is commonly determined as the line in the @xmath63 plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] ) where the nuclear energy generation rate is equal to the local neutrino emissivity of dense matter ( the neutrino emission carries the generated energy out of the star ) . at higher",

    "[ fig : diag ] we present the carbon ignition ( solid ) curve , calculated using the most optional model of carbon burning , together with its uncertainties ( limited by the minimum and maximum rate models ) .",
    "the neutrino energy losses are assumed to be produced by plasmon decay and by electron - nucleus bremsstrahlung .",
    "the neutrino emissivity due to plasmon decay is obtained from extended tables calculated by m.  e.  gusakov ( unpublished ) ; they are in good agreement with the results by itoh et al .",
    "the neutrino bremsstrahlung emissivity is calculated using the formalism of kaminker et al .",

    "they become important at @xmath250 g  @xmath3 and @xmath251 k in the intermediate thermo - pycnonuclear burning regime and the thermally enhanced burning regime .",
    "this @xmath63 range is appropriate for central regions of massive and warm white dwarfs which may produce type ia supernova explosions .",
    "lower @xmath20 are also interesting for these studies ( e.g. , baraffe et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "if we formally continue the ignition curve to lower @xmath20 , it will bend and shift to lower densities , where the nuclear burning time scale @xmath247 is exceptionally slow exceeding the age of the universe .",
    "the bend is associated with a very weak neutrino emission at @xmath252 k. these parts of the ignition curve are oversimplified because at low @xmath20 the energy outflow produced by thermal conduction becomes more efficient than the outflow due to the neutrino emission .",
    "these parts are shown by the long - dash line ( and their uncertainties are indicated by thin dash - and - dot lines ) .",
    "unfortunately , the conduction energy outflow is non - local and `` non - universal '' .",
    "it depends on specific conditions of the burning environment ( a white dwarf core or a neutron star crust ) and the associated thermal conductivity ( provided mainly by strongly degenerate electrons ) . in this case",
    "the ignition becomes especially complicated .",
    "a very crude estimate shows that the ignition curve , governed by the thermal conduction , is nearly vertical and close to the @xmath253 yr curve in the range of @xmath20 from @xmath237  k to @xmath254  k in fig .",

    "@xcite ) . under these conditions",
    "the electron conduction is determined by inefficient normal electron - phonon scattering , leading to high conductivity values .",
    "this shifts the ignition to higher @xmath19 . on the other hand ,",
    "carbon matter may contain randomly located ions of other elements ( charged impurities ) which can keep the electron coulomb scattering rather efficient and maintain a low electron thermal conductivity . in this case the ignition curve at @xmath256  k remains nearly vertical .",
    "the goal of this paper was to develop a phenomenological formalism for calculating fusion reaction rates between identical nuclei .",
    "this formalism should be applicable for a broad range of thermonuclear and pycnonuclear burning scenarios .",
    "it involves a generalized treatment for calculation of the fusion probability at low energies and the development of a single simple phenomenological expression for the fusion rate valid in a wide range of temperatures and densities .",
    "we have introduced a generalized model approach for calculating the @xmath0-factor of heavy - ion fusion reactions relevant for stellar nucleosynthesis processes .",
    "we have demonstrated the applicability and reliability of the approach by calculating the astrophysical factor @xmath52 for the carbon fusion reaction @xmath1c+@xmath1c ( section [ sfactor ] ) and by comparing the theoretical results with experimental data .",
    "furthermore , we have analyzed ( section [ fusion ] ) previous calculations of the fusion rate for identical nuclei in stellar matter , with emphasis on the complicated problem of coulomb barrier penetration in a dense - plasma environment . combining the results of previous studies ,",
    "we have proposed a single simple phenomenological expression for the fusion rate , valid in all five fusion regimes ( that can be realized in the different @xmath63 regions ) .",
    "our formula contains adjustable parameters whose variations reflect theoretical uncertainties of the reaction rates .    for illustration , we have considered ( section [ carbonburn ] ) the efficiency of carbon burning in dense matter and the conditions for carbon ignition in white dwarf cores and neutron star crusts .",
    "we show that carbon burning is actually important in a sufficiently narrow @xmath63 strip which is mainly determined by the temperature @xmath257 k as long as @xmath258 g  @xmath3 , and by the density @xmath259 g  @xmath3 as long as @xmath260  k. on the basis of these results we suggest that the current knowledge of nuclear fusion is sufficient to understand the main features of carbon burning in stellar matter , especially at @xmath261  g  @xmath3 .    we have focused on the simplest case of heavy - ion burning in a one - component coulomb system ; particularly , in a perfect crystal .",
    "there is no doubt that dense matter of white dwarfs and neutron stars are more complicated and require a more complex approach taking into account mixtures of different heavy nuclei and imperfections in dense matter .",
    "the complexity ranges from essentially two - component plasma conditions anticipated in the carbon - oxygen cores of white dwarfs to the multi - component isotope distribution in the ashes of accreting neutron stars @xcite .    in a forthcoming paper",
