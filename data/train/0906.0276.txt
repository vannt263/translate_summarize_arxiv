    "negative - index ( also known as negative phase velocity or left - handed ) metamaterials ( nims ) form a novel class of electromagnetic media that promises revolutionary breakthroughs in photonics @xcite .",
    "significant progress has been achieved recently in the design of bulk , multilayered , negative - index , plasmonic structures @xcite .",
    "the majority of nims realized to date consist of metal - dielectric nanostructures that have highly controllable magnetic and dielectric responses .",
    "the problem , however , is that these structures have losses that are difficult to avoid , especially in the visible range of frequencies .",
    "irrespective of their origin , losses constitute a major hurdle to the practical realization of the unique optical applications of these structures .",
    "therefore , developing efficient loss - compensating techniques is of paramount importance .",
    "so far , the most common approaches to compensating losses in nims are related to the investigation of the possibility to embed amplifying centers in the host matrix @xcite .",
    "the amplification is supposed to be provided through a population inversion between the levels of the embedded centers .",
    "herein , we investigate alternative options based on coherent , nonlinear optical ( nlo ) energy transfer from the control optical field(s ) to the signal through optical parametric amplification ( opa ) .",
    "nonlinear optics in nims remains so far a less - developed branch of optics . on a fundamental level ,",
    "the nlo response of nanostructured metamaterials is not completely understood or characterized and can not be predicted effectively to date .",
    "nevertheless , it is well established that local - field enhanced nonlinearities can be attributed to plasmonic nanostructures , and some rough estimates of their magnitude can be obtained .",
    "the feasibility of crafting nims with strong nlo responses in the optical wavelength range has been experimentally demonstrated in @xcite . unlike natural , positive - index ( pi ) materials , the energy flow and the phase velocity",
    "are counter - directed in nims , which determines their extraordinary linear and nlo propagation properties .",
    "unusual properties of nonlinear propagation processes in nims , such as second harmonic generation , three - wave mixing ( twm ) and four - wave mixing ( fwm ) opa , which are in a drastic contrast with their counterparts in natural materials , were shown in @xcite .",
    "striking changes in the properties of nonlinear pulse propagation and temporal solitons @xcite , spatial solitons in systems with bistability @xcite , gap solitons @xcite , and optical bistability in layered structures including nims @xcite were revealed .",
    "a review of some of the corresponding theoretical approaches is given in @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , we investigate the effects of idler absorption and phase mismatch on parametric amplification of the backward waves and propose a novel scheme of compensating losses based on the results of this investigation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ me ] , the similarities between the solutions to the nonlinear propagation equations for the electric and magnetic , quadratic and cubic nonlinearities are shown for the case of uniform control fields . here , the local linear and nonlinear parameters are assumed independent of the intensities of the control fields , and the conclusions are applicable to both twm and fwm .",
    "the induced transparency exhibits a resonance behavior as a function of the control field intensity and the nim slab s thickness due to the backwardness of the light waves in nims .",
    "usually , the resonances are narrow , especially if the parametric process is assisted by amplification of the idler due to raman or population - inversion gain .",
    "the sample remains opaque anywhere beyond the resonance magnitudes of the control field and the resonance thickness of the sample .",
    "counterintuitively , we show that transparency becomes achievable within a broad range of these parameters if the absorption for the idler exceeds that for the signal .",
    "phase matching of the contrapropagating waves presents a technical challenge @xcite .",
    "we also show that , in the above indicated case , the transparency of a nim slab also becomes much more robust against the phase mismatch . based on these outcomes ,",
    "we propose and investigate in section [ lta ] the option of independent engineering of the negative index and fwm nonlinear response , which is different from the one proposed earlier @xcite .",
    "we consider the doped metamaterial , where the signal appears in the vicinity of the transition between the excited energy levels , whereas the idler couples with the ground state of the embedded quasiresonant centers that provide a resonantly enhanced , fwm response . here , all local optical characteristics including nonlinear susceptibility exhibit a strong dependence on the intensity for the driving fields and on the frequency resonance offsets of the coupled waves .",
    "hence , the output signal can be tailored through the means of quantum control .",
    "it is shown that the indicated cardinal changes in the coupling scheme bring about major changes in the properties of the laser - induced transparency of the doped nim slabs .",
    "the possibility of eliminating the negative role of the phase mismatch on the tailored transparency of the slab in this case is also shown .",

    ", the proposed coupling scheme suggests that the frequency of the negative - index signal should fall in the vicinity of the transition between the excited levels of the centers , while the idler frequency appears coupled with the absorptive transition from the ground state .",
    "the scheme under investigation is different from the earlier proposed schemes and exhibits essentially different features .",
    "the extraordinary properties of the nonlinear - optical propagation processes in both outlined types of metamaterials are investigated .",
    "these properties are in drastic contrast with their counterparts in ordinary , positive index materials .",
    "the focus of this work is on the possibility of compensating for the strong losses inherent to metal - dielectric negative - index metamaterials and on producing laser - induced optical transparency and gain for the negative - index signal . in the case of a frequency- and intensity - independent nonlinear - optical response of the composite ,",
    "the feasibility of producing transparency and amplification through the entire negative - index frequency domain above a certain control laser field intensity is investigated .",
    "this is shown to be possible by adjusting the absorption index for the idler to be greater than that for the negative - index signal .",
    "specific features of the quantum control attributed to the second scheme are investigated that allow for transformable optics through frequency - tunable narrow - band transparency , quantum switching , filtering and amplification of light .",
    "the possibility of compensating the strong losses inherent to nims and realizing a miniature , mirrorless optical parametric generator of entangled contra - propagating backward and ordinary waves is also shown and supported by numerical simulations .",
    "the extraordinary features predicted in this work stem from the backwardness of electromagnetic waves , which is a feature inherent to this type of metamaterial .",
