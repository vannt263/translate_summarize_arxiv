    "the standard model of cosmology based on the cosmological principle ( homogeneity , isotropy , validity of general relativity ) which contains about 23% dark matter , 4% ordinary matter and 73% dark energy driving the acceleration of a flat universe has been established .",
    "many astronomical observations support this standard picture , including type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) ( riess et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ( komatsu et al . 2011 ; sherwin et al . 2011 ) , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) ( eisenstein et al . 2005 ) and gamma - ray bursts ( dai et al . 2004 ; wang et al . 2007 ; 2011 ) .    in the meanwhile , inhomogeneous lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) ( lematre 1933 ; tolman 1934",
    "; bondi 1947 ) universe could also induce an apparent dimming of the light of distant supernovae .",
    "the idea is to drop the dark energy and the copernican principle , and instead suppose that we are near the center of a large , nonlinearly underdense , nearly spherical void surrounded by a flat , matter dominated einstein - de sitter ( eds ) spacetime . because the observer must be at the center of void",
    ", so the ltb models violate the copernican principle .",
    "because of the observed isotropy of the cmb , the observer must be located very close to the center of the void ( alnes & amarzguioui 2006 ) .",
    "it was demonstrated ltb models can fit the sne ia data , as well as the bao data and the cmb data ( garcia - bellido & haugboelle 2008 ) .",
    "some tests have actually been proposed : the goodman - caldwell - stebbins test , which looks at the cmb inside our past lightcone ( goodman 1995 ; caldwell & stebbins 2008 ) , the curvature test , which is based on the tight relation between curvature and expansion history in a friedmann spacetime ( clarkson et al .",
    "2008 ) , and the radial and transverse bao scale ( zibin et al . 2008 ; garcia - bellido & haugboelle 2009 ) .",
    "however , based on these tests , void models have not yet been ruled out ( clifton et al .",
    "2008 ; uzan et al . 2008 ; biswas et al . 2010 ; wang & zhang 2012 ; nadathur & sarkar 2011 ) .",
    "zhang & stebbins ( 2011 ) have excluded the hubble bubble model as the possibility of cosmic acceleration using the the compton - y distortion .",
    "zibin & moss ( 2011 ) also concluded that a very large class of void models was ruled out using this method .",
    "here we propose a powerful tool , the orientations of galaxy pairs to test the copernican principle .",
    "the alcock - paczynski ( ap ) test is a purely geometric test of the expansion of the universe ( alcock & paczyski 1979 ) .",
    "marinoni & buzzi ( 2010 ) implemented the ap test with the distribution of orientations of galaxy pairs in orbit around each other in binary systems .",
    "the principle of this method is that the orientations is thought to be completely random , with all orientations being equally likely if measured assuming a cosmology that matches the true underlying cosmology of the universe in a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe after the effect of peculiar motion is excluded .    in this paper",
    ", we implement the alcock - paczynski test with pairs of galaxies to test the copernican principle .",
    "the void models can not both fit sne ia plus cmb data and orientations of galaxy pairs .",
    "our results exclude the possibility of the void models as the source of cosmic accelerating expansion and favor the copernican principle .",
    "we model the void as an isotropic , radially inhomogeneous universe described by the ltb metric , @xmath1 where a prime denotes the partial derivative with respect to the coordinate distance @xmath2 , and the curvature @xmath3 is a free function representing the local curvature . the transverse expansion rate is defined as @xmath4 and the radial expansion rate is defined as @xmath5 , where an overdot denotes the partial derivative with respect to @xmath6 .    the friedmann equation in ltb metric is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a free function which determines the local energy density .",
    "the dimensionless density parameters can be determined as @xmath9 and @xmath10 by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively at the present time @xmath17 .",
    "so we can rewrite friedmann equation in ltb metric as @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "this equation can be integrated from the time of the big bang , @xmath19 , to yield the age of the universe at any given @xmath20 , @xmath21 the function , @xmath14 , corresponds to a gauge mode and we choose to set @xmath22 . as stressed by silk ( 1977 ) and",
    "zibin ( 2008 ) , it is crucial to consider only voids with vanishing decaying mode , so we set @xmath23 everywhere . although biswas et al ( 2010 ) have shown that the void models were in better agreement with observations if the void has been generated sometime in the early universe .",
    "the null radial geodesics described by @xmath24 where @xmath25 . the angular diameter distance and luminosity distance are given by @xmath26    we will adopt the two parameterizations of the void profile @xmath9 .",
    "the first one is the constrained gbh model ( garcia - bellido & haugboelle 2008 ) @xmath27 where the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 characterize size and steepness of the density profile respectively .",
    "we wish to look only at voids that are asymptotically eds , so we set @xmath30 .",
    "we also set @xmath31 , because this value can well fit the sne ia data ( garcia - bellido & haugboelle 2008 ; marra & paakkonen 2010 ) .",
    "this density shape of gbh model can also explain other observations , such as cmb and bao .",
    "the second one is a simple gaussian form , @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the matter density parameters at the observer s position and in the flrw background outside the void , and @xmath28 characterizes the size of the void .",
    "it has been shown that this void profile can fit the observations of sne ia , cmb and bao ( nadathur & sarkar 2011 ) .",
    "we use the recent union2 sne compilation ( amanullah et al . 2010 ) , which consists 557 sne ia in the redshift range @xmath35 . with @xmath36 in units of megaparsecs , the predicted distance modulus is @xmath37 .",
    "the likelihood analysis is based on the @xmath38 function : @xmath39 ^ 2}{\\sigma_i^2}.\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath40 is an unknown offset .",
    "we marginalize the likelihood @xmath41 over @xmath40 , leading to a new marginalized @xmath38 function : @xmath42 where @xmath43^n/\\sigma_i^2 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 contours in the parameter space @xmath47 for the constrained gbh model . the dash - dot contours represent constraint from sne ia+cmb , the dashed contours from aap , and the solid contours from sne ia+cmb+aap .",
    "the best fit parameters are @xmath48 gpc and @xmath49 for sne ia+cmb .",
    "but in order to fit the aap , much more larger and underdense void are needed .",
    "this void model can not fit both the sne ia plus cmb data and the orientations of galaxy pairs.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we also use positions and amplitudes of peaks and troughs in the cmb spectrum to test the ltb models . the location of peaks and troughs can be calculated as hu et al .",
    "( 2001 ) : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the angular diameter distance with the sound horizon of @xmath53 at the recombination redshift of @xmath54 .",
    "we use the method of marra & paakkonen ( 2010 ) to calculated these values .",
    "we consider the position of the first , second , third peak and of the first trough .",
    "we compute the corresponding phases @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 using the accurate analytical fits of doran & lilley ( 2002 ) .",
    "the relative heights of second and third peak relative to the first one , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are also considered , for which we can use the fits of hu et al .",
    "so the @xmath61 is ( marra & paakkonen 2010 ) @xmath62 where the w7 represents the best - fit wmap7 spectrum ( jarosik et al . 2011 ) .",
    "same as fig.2 , but for the gaussian ltb model .",
    "the best fit parameters are @xmath63 gpc and @xmath64 from sne ia+cmb .",
    "the aap favors a much more larger and underdense void.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    pairs of galaxies should be distributed with random orientations if the fundamental assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy are correct .",
    "but two factors affect this simple cosmology test .",
    "first , peculiar velocities displace the position of a galaxy along the line of sight from its true position .",
    "marinoni and buzzi modelled the peculiar velocity distortion as a doppler shift where the observed line of sight separation is related to the actual separation .",
    "second , an observer needs to assume a cosmological model to convert observed angles and redshifts into comoving distances .",
    "the uniform distribution of orientations is distorted if a wrong underlying cosmology of the universe is assumed .    in a non - flat @xmath65cdm universe , the tilting angle @xmath6 subtended between galaxy pairs and the line of sight ,",
    "can be written as @xmath66 ^ 2\\}^{-1 } , \\label{tilt}\\ ] ] for details , see marinoni et al .",
    "it is nontrivial to calculate the tilting angle and average anisotropy of pairs in ltb models . the measured galaxy ( matter ) clustering and",
    "its evolution agree with the standard @xmath65cdm cosmology to a factor of about 2 uncertainty up to z@xmath671 ( tegmark et al .",
    "2004 ; coil et al .",
    "2006 ; fu et al . 2008",
    "; schrabback et al . 2010 ; guzzo et al .",
    "a minimalist approach is to simply use the @xmath65cdm value since any viable ltb models must be consistent with these data .",
    "so we use the observed average anisotropy of pairs from marinoni & buzzi ( 2010 ) derived in @xmath65cdm cosmology .",
    "zhang & stebbins ( 2011 ) also approximated the matter power spectrum by its form in a standard @xmath65cdm cosmology .",
    "the observed tilting angle is shifted to apparent angle @xmath68 because of the geometric distortions induced by the peculiar velocities of the pair s members .",
    "the probability distribution function of the apparent angle @xmath68 which is is given by marinoni & buzzi ( 2010 ) @xmath69^{3/2}}|\\tan \\tau| { \\rm{d } } \\tau \\ , , \\label{dist}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the parameter @xmath70 depends on the cosmological expansion history as @xmath71 the normalization parameter @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 . because in the ltb metric , the transverse and radial expansion rates are different , so the correct value must be used in our calculations .",
    "when we use the galaxy pairs for ap test , the velocity perturbation @xmath70 used in equation ( 12 ) is related to the peculiar motions of the pair members along the line of sight .",
    "so we use radial expansion rate @xmath74 to calculate the velocity perturbation . because the ap test is similar to bao , we can see this formula is also similar to the redshift interval @xmath75 corresponding to the acoustic scale in the radial direction ( garcia - bellido & haugboelle 2008 ; biswas et al .",
    "2010 ; marra & paakkonen 2010 ) . in the homogeneous @xmath65cdm model , marinoni & buzzi ( 2010 ) used the normal expansion rate @xmath76 .",
    "marinoni & buzzi ( 2010 ) derived the distribution @xmath77 as the average anisotropy of pair ( aap ) , which is given by @xmath78 at @xmath79 , marinoni & buzzi ( 2010 ) obtained @xmath80 , using binaries in the seventh data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( abazajian et al .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath72 is assumed to be constant for all redshifts and for different galaxy selections ( marinoni & buzzi 2010 ) .",
    "although jennings et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found that the value of @xmath72 could have a small variation with cosmology and redshift , marinoni & buzzi established that the changes of best fit value can not exceed the @xmath44 confidence level if the variation of @xmath72 is less than 10% .",
    "so this assumption could be reasonable .",
    "belloso et al .",
    "( 2012 ) also found that observations of close - pairs of galaxies do show promise for ap cosmological measurements , especially for low mass , isolated galaxies .",
    "the high - redshift ( up to @xmath81 ) aap are obtained using the third data release of the deep2 survey ( davis et al .",

    "in order to verify the hypothesis that the normalization factor @xmath72 is constant for all redshifts , the distance between the observed value of recession velocity difference square @xmath86 and the prediction of equation ( s20 ) in marinoni & buzzi ( 2010 ) is minimal ( see marinoni & buzzi ( 2010 ) for more details ) . so this @xmath38 value is @xmath87 ^ 2}{\\sigma_{dv_o^2,i}^2}.\\ ] ] we use the value of @xmath86 and @xmath88 from fig.(5s ) of marinoni & buzzi ( 2010 ) .",

    "the allowed range of @xmath28 is @xmath95 at @xmath46 level from sne ia+cmb .",
    "but the allowed range of @xmath28 is @xmath96 gpc at @xmath46 level from aap .",
    "these two contours do not overlap .",

    "this model is also excluded at the @xmath0 confidence level compared to @xmath65cdm . from the @xmath100 of the two void models ,",

    "the @xmath38 value is 41.96 for these nine data points .",
    "we must note that the local hubble constant @xmath106 is also a big obstacle to the void models . because the measurement of the hubble constant is carried out mostly within a distance of roughly @xmath107 mpc ( riess et al . 2011 ; freedman et al . 2012 )",
    ", we obtain the @xmath106 ( marra & paakkonen 2010 ) @xmath108 in order to fit both the sne ia and cmb , the value of @xmath106 is @xmath109 in the constrained gbh model or @xmath110 in the gaussian ltb model .",
    "riess et al . (",
    "2011 ) determined the hubble constant with 3% uncertainty as @xmath111 @xmath112 .",
    "freedman et al . ( 2012 ) measured the hubble constant as @xmath113 @xmath114 .",
    "previous investigations show that void models can fit a variety of cosmological observations without containing dark energy because the lack of homogeneity gives a great degree of flexibility .",
    "for example , since the last scattering surface is far away from regions where sne ia are observed , the property of inhomogeneity allows a model to be constructed which provides different physical densities in the regions from which these two sets of observational data are drawn .",
    "so , the best way to constrain inhomogeneous models is using several sets of data that measure a range of observables at comparable redshifts . in this paper , we confront two general classes of void models with observations of sne ia , cmb and orientations of galaxy pairs .",
    "the redshifts of sne ia and orientations of galaxy pairs are almost in the same range .",
    "we find that the these two void profiles _ can not _",
    "fit both sne ia plus cmb data and orientations of galaxy pairs simultaneously .",
    "we also show that the two void models can fit both sne ia and cmb data , but at the expense of a hubble constant so low that they can also be ruled out .",
    "so our results favor the copernician principle .",
    "we must also note that our results are obtained under some assumptions , such as the chosen priors and void profile , which is also discussed in biswas et al .",
    "so the void models are ruled out at the @xmath0 confidence level given the explored models and priors .",
    "but observations challenge the void models ( biswas et al .",
    "2010 ; zibin & moss 2011 ) .",
    "future galaxy surveys such as bigboss ( schlegel et al . 2011 ) will provide improved precision of aap function , placing much more strong constraints on inhomogeneity .",
