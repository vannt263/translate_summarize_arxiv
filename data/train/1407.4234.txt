    "the past decade has seen a flourishing of abstract argumentation theory , a coarse - grained high - level form of defeasible reasoning introduced by dung [ dung 95 ] .",
    "it is characterized by a top - down perspective which ignores the logical fine structure of arguments and focuses instead on logical ( conflict , support , ... ) or extra - logical ( preferences , ... ) relations between given black box arguments so as to identify reasonable argumentative positions .",
    "one way to address the complexity of enriched argument structures carrying interacting relations , and to identify the best approaches for evaluating dung s basic attack frameworks as well as more sophisticated argumentation systems , is to look for deeper unifying semantic foundations allowing us to improve , compare , and judge existing proposals , or to develop new ones .",
    "a major issue is to what extent an abstract account can adequately model concrete argumentative reasoning in the context of a sufficiently expressive , preferably defeasible logic .",
    "the instantiation of abstract frameworks by more fine - grained logic - based argument constructions and configurations is therefore an important tool for justifying or criticising abstract argumentation theories .",
    "most of this work is however based on the first generation of nonmonotonic formalisms , like reiter s default logic or logic programming .",
    "while these are closer to classical logic and the original spirit of dung s approach , it is well known that they fail to model plausible implication .",
    "in fact , they are haunted by counterintuitive behaviour and violate major desiderata for default reasoning encoded in benchmark examples and rationality postulates [ mak 94 ] .",
    "for instance , the only way to deal even with simple instances of specificity reasoning are opaque ad hoc prioritization mechanisms .",
    "the goal of the present work is therefore to supplement existing instantiation efforts with a simple ranking - based semantic model which interprets arguments and attacks by conditional knowledge bases .",
    "the well - behaved ranking construction semantics for default reasoning [ wey 96 , 98 , 03 ] can then be exploited to specify a new extension semantics for dung frameworks which allows us to directly evaluate the plausibility of argument collections .",
    "its occasionally unorthodox behaviour may shed a new light on basic argumentation - theoretic assumptions and concepts .",
    "we start with an introduction to default reasoning based on the ranking construction paradigm . after a short look at abstract argumentation theory",
    ", we show how to interpret abstract argumentation frameworks by instantiating the arguments and characterizing the attacks with suitable sets of conditionals describing constraints over ranking models . based on the concept of generic instantiations ,",
    "i.e.  using minimal assumptions , and plausibility maximization , we then specify a natural ranking - based extension semantics .",
    "we conclude with a simple algorithm , some instructive examples , and the discussion of several important properties .",

    "default inference is an important instance of nonmonotonic reasoning concerned with drawing reasonable but potentially defeasible conclusions from knowledge bases of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath6 is a set of assumptions or facts , e.g.  encoding knowledge about a specific state of affairs in the domain language @xmath0 , and @xmath11 is a collection of conditionals expressing strict or exception - tolerant implicational information over @xmath0 , which is used to guide defeasible inference .",

    "the actual impact of a default depends of course on the context @xmath10 and the chosen nonmonotonic inference concept @xmath20 , which will be discussed later .",
    "we can distinguish two perspectives in default reasoning : the autoepistemic / context - based one , and the plausibilistic / quasi - probabilistic one .",
    "the former is exemplified by reiter s default logic , where defaults are usually modeled by normal default rules of the form @xmath21 ( if @xmath17 , and it is consistent that @xmath18 , then @xmath18 ) .",
    "a characteristic feature is that the conclusions are obtained by intersecting suitable equilibrium sets , known as extensions .",
    "the alternative is to use default conditionals interpreted by some preferential or valuational semantics , e.g. system z [ pea 90 , leh 92 ] , or probabilistic me - based accounts [ gmp 93 ] ( me = maximum - entropy ) .",
    "for historical reasons and technical convenience ( closeness to classical logic ) , the first approach has received most attention , especially in the context of argumentation . however",
    ", this ignores the fact that the conditional semantic paradigm has a much better record when it comes to the natural handling of benchmark examples and the satisfaction of rationality postulates [ mak 94 ] .",
    "it therefore seems promising to investigate whether such semantic - based accounts can also help to instantiate and evaluate abstract argumentation frameworks .",
    "our default conditional semantics for interpreting argumentation frameworks is based on the simplest plausibility measure concept able to reasonably handle independence and conditionalization , namely spohn s ranking functions [ spo 88 , 12 ] , or more generally , ranking measures [ wey 94 ] .",

    "@xmath55 is monotonic and verifies the axioms and rules of preferential conditional logic and disjunctive rationality ( threshold semantics : no rational monotony ) for @xmath56 [ klm 90 ] .",
    "but it is important to understand that the central concept in default reasoning is not some monotonic conditional logic for @xmath57 , but a nonmonotonic meta - level inference relation @xmath20 over @xmath58 specifying which conclusions @xmath59 can be plausibly inferred from finite @xmath60 .",

    "the idea of abstract argumentation theory , launched by dung [ dun 95 ] , has been to replace the traditional bottom - up strategy , which models and exploits the logical fine structure of arguments , by a top - down perspective , where arguments become black boxes evaluated only based on knowledge about specific logical or extra - logical relationships connecting them .",
    "it is interesting to see that such a coarse - grained relational analysis often seems sufficient to determine which collections of instantiated arguments are reasonable .",
    "in addition to possible conceptual and computational gains , the abstract viewpoint offers furthermore a powerful methodological tool for general argumentation - theoretic investigations .",
    "an abstract argumentation framework in the original sense of dung is a structure of the form @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is a collection of abstract entities representing arguments , and @xmath124 is a possibly asymmetric binary attack relation modeling conflicts between arguments . to grasp the expressive complexity of real - world argumentation ,",
    "several authors have extended this basic account to include further inferential or cognitive relations , like support links , preferences , valuations , or collective attacks .",
    "our general definition [ wey 11 ] for the first - order context is as follows .    a general abstract argumentation framework , or hyperframework ( hf ) , is just a structure of the form @xmath125 , where @xmath123 is the domain of arguments , the @xmath126 are conflictual , and the @xmath127 non - conflictual relations over @xmath123 .",

    "the general inferential task in abstract argumentation is to identify reasonable evaluations of the arguments described by @xmath130 , e.g.  to find out which sets of arguments describe acceptable argumentative positions . these are called extensions .",
    "in dung s scenario , the extensions are @xmath131 obeying suitable acceptability conditions in the context of @xmath130 , the minimal requirement being the absence of internal conflicts .",

    "this suggests a more general semantic perspective [ wey 11 ] .    a hyperframework semantics is a map @xmath139 associating with each hyperframework @xmath125 of a given signature a collection @xmath140 of distinguished evaluation structures expanding @xmath130 , of the form @xmath141",

    "if @xmath145 , we are back to dung .",
    "ideally , abstract argumentation frameworks should be reconstructible as actual abstractions of logic - based argumentation scenarios .",
    "such an anchoring seems required to develop , evaluate , and apply the abstract models in a suitable way . in a first step , this amounts to instantiate the abstract arguments from the framework domain by logical entities representing concrete arguments , and to interpret the abstract framework structure by specific inferential or evaluational relationships fitting the conceptual intentions the abstract level tries to capture . in what follows we will sketch a natural hierarchy of instantiation layers , passing from more concrete , deep instantiations , to more abstract , shallow ones , with a focus on the intermediate level . + * structured instantiations : * + we start with logic - based structured argumentation over a defeasible conditional logic @xmath146 , with @xmath147 as a classical tarskian background logic . for the moment , we do not impose any further a priori conditions on @xmath148 .",

    "we may ignore the exact nature of the justification steps .",
    "note that the correctness of local inference steps does not entail the global correctness of the argument @xmath149 .",

    "@xmath169 . @xmath170 and @xmath171 , but @xmath172 .",
    "this example looks odd because accepting the whole argument would require the acceptance of all its claims , which is blocked by @xmath173 .",
    "in fact , a natural requirement for an acceptable argument @xmath149 would be :  @xmath174 .",
    "this means that the factual premises and the material implications corresponding to the conditional premises are classically consistent .",
    "note that this condition is strictly stronger than @xmath175 because we typically have @xmath176 whereas @xmath177 .",
    "however , in practice , without omniscience w.r.t .",
    "propositional logic , it may not be clear whether these global conditions are actually satisfied . real arguments may well be inconsistent in the strong sense .    in structured argumentation , an argument tree has two functions : first , to describe and offer a prima facie justification for a claim , and secondly , to specify target points where other arguments may attack .",
    "it is essentially a computational tool which is intended to help identifying - or even defining - inferential relationships within a suitable defeasible conditional logic @xmath148 , and to help specifying attack relations to determine reasonable argumentative positions .",

    "+ * conditional instantiations : * + our basic idea is that , whatever the requirements for argumentation trees in the context of @xmath148 , and whatever the content of an argument @xmath149 represented by such a tree @xmath151 , it should only depend on the collection of local claims @xmath178 node of @xmath179 , and more specifically , on the choice of the main claim @xmath154 , the premise claims @xmath160 , and the intermediate claims @xmath180 .",
    "in fact , because the acceptance of a structured argument includes the acceptance of all its subarguments , we have to consider the main claims of the subarguments as well .",
    "so we can assume that the content of @xmath151 is fixed by the triple @xmath181 .",
    "an agent accepting @xmath149 obviously has to be committed to all the elements of the base @xmath182 .",
    "to be fully acceptable w.r.t .",
    "@xmath148 , the structured argument also has to be globally correct in the sense that all its local claims are actually defeasibly entailed by @xmath160 .",
    "in particular , @xmath183 for each @xmath184 .",
    "this requirement should also hold for each subargument @xmath185 of @xmath149 .",
    "but note that , because of defeasibility , this does not exclude that the premises @xmath186 of a subargument @xmath185 could implicitly infer the negation of a local claim @xmath187 external to @xmath185 , as long as this conflicting inference is eventually overridden by the full premise set @xmath160 .",
    "it follows that the strengthening of a subargument by choosing a stronger claim could undermine global correctness .",
    "but if the intermediate claims are always inferred and therefore implicitly present , we may actually drop @xmath180 and just consider for each globally correct argument @xmath149 the finite inference pair @xmath188 .    given a pure dung framework @xmath122 and the defeasible conditional logic @xmath148 , a structured instantiation @xmath189 of @xmath130 maps each @xmath138 to a globally correct argument tree @xmath151 over @xmath148 .",
    "on the most general level , we do not want to impose a priori further restrictions beyond inferential correctness . in practice one may however well decide to focus on specific argument trees , e.g.  those using specific justification steps .",

    "note that it depends on the tree concept whether we can obtain all the correct inference pairs .    in monotonic argumentation , the consistency and minimality of the premise sets are standard assumptions .",
    "but within defeasible argumentation , a more liberal perspective may be preferable .",
    "for instance , on the structured level , we want to allow arguments claiming @xmath193 .",
    "the reductio ad absurdum principle then offers a possibility to attack arguments from within .",

    "the existence of models of @xmath194 which do not violate any conditional in @xmath195 , is a natural requirement in the context of argumentation theory .",
    "but we can replace it by a qualified version , restricted to those instances where @xmath160 is actually consistent .",
    "what about minimality ?",
    "first , it may obviously fail for inference pairs obtained by flattening argument trees .",
    "of course , we could consider an additional minimization step where we replace each @xmath188 by all those @xmath196 with @xmath197 and which are minimal s.t .",
    "although this may be computationally costly , it could be theoretically appealing .",
    "however , minimality could also be questioned because by adding premises , a conclusion may successively get accepted , rejected , and accepted again , letting the character of the inferential support change between different levels of specifity , which calls for a discrimination between the corresponding inference pairs .",
    "proponents of minimality object that these types of support could , perhaps , also be reproduced by suitable minimal @xmath196 .",
    "however , this assumption is not sustainable for ranking - based semantics for argumentation , because here the results may change if we restrict ourselves to minimal premise sets .",
    "in fact , shrinking @xmath160 to @xmath199 may actually increase the set of possible attacks .",
    "in particular , we could have attacks on all the minimal @xmath198 , but none on @xmath200 .",
