    "quadrupole deformations of atomic nuclei can be of two types : @xmath2 deformations which preserve axial symmetry and @xmath0 deformations which lead to triaxial shapes . although the collective model of nuclei introduced these ideas more than 50 years ago  @xcite , it is still a matter of debate to what extent triaxiality is present in nuclei and , specifically , whether nuclear ground states exhibit stable triaxial deformation . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath0 bands , associated with collective vibrations that break axial symmetry , are a well - established feature in the spectroscopy of deformed nuclei .    in this paper",
    "we undertake a detailed analysis of @xmath0-band properties , in particular their signature splitting or even  odd staggering , in order to shed light on the question of triaxiality . the gist of the argument for doing this is as follows .",
    "theoretical spectra derived from potentials which are either soft or rigid in the @xmath0 degree of freedom , display @xmath0 bands with different signature splitting .",
    "the observed energies of the @xmath0-band members can therefore be used to fix the degree of softness or rigidity in @xmath0 .",
    "this idea is worked out here in the context of the interacting boson model ( ibm )  @xcite which proposes an algebraic or group - theoretical description of collective quadrupole excitations in nuclei .",
    "the ibm is particularly well suited for our present purpose for two reasons .",
    "first , its phenomenological application generally leads to accurate calculations of nuclear properties at low energy .",
    "as will be shown , a very precise description of the @xmath0-band signature splitting can be obtained with three - body interactions between the bosons .",
    "second , once the algebraic hamiltonian is fitted to the data , an intuitive , geometric picture in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath0 deformations can be obtained in the so - called classical limit . in this way",
    "we establish a unbiased procedure which gauges the importance of triaxiality from the data .    in the present study",
    "we focus our attention on nuclei that are usually interpreted as soft in @xmath0 [ or close to the so(6 ) limit of the ibm ] and we investigate to what extent the observed signature splitting in the @xmath0 band signals the occurrence of more rigid triaxiality .",
    "in this section we give a brief description of the ibm with particular emphasis on the version of the model which includes higher - order interactions between the bosons . a full account of the ibm",
    "is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the building blocks of the ibm are @xmath3 and @xmath1 bosons with angular momenta @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "a nucleus is characterized by a constant total number of bosons @xmath6 which equals half the number of valence nucleons ( particles or holes , whichever is smaller ) . in this paper",
    "no distinction is made between neutron and proton bosons , an approximation which is known as .    since the hamiltonian of the conserves the total number of bosons ,",
    "it can be written in terms of the 36 operators @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) creates ( annihilates ) a boson with angular momentum @xmath10 and @xmath11 projection @xmath12 .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that this set of 36 operators generates the lie algebra u(6 ) of unitary transformations in six dimensions .",
    "a hamiltonian that conserves the total number of bosons is of the generic form @xmath13 where the index refers to the order of the interaction in the generators of u(6 ) .",
    "the first term @xmath14 is a constant which represents the binding energy of the core .",
    "the second term is the one - body part @xmath15^{(0)}+ \\epsilon_d\\sqrt{5}[d^\\dag\\times\\tilde d]^{(0)}\\equiv \\epsilon_s\\hat n_s+ \\epsilon_d\\hat n_d , \\label{e_ham1}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 refers to coupling in angular momentum ( shown as an upperscript in round brackets ) , @xmath17 and the coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the energies of the @xmath3 and @xmath1 bosons .",
    "the third term in the hamiltonian  ( [ e_ham ] ) represents the two - body interaction @xmath20^{(l)}\\times [ \\tilde b_{\\ell'_2}\\times\\tilde b_{\\ell'_1}]^{(l)}]^{(0)}_0 , \\label{e_ham2}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath21 are related to the interaction matrix elements between normalized two - boson states , @xmath22 since the bosons are necessarily symmetrically coupled , allowed two - boson states are @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) . since for @xmath29 states with a given angular momentum one has @xmath30 interactions , seven independent two - body interactions @xmath31 are found : three for @xmath24 , three for @xmath26 and one for @xmath32 .",
    "this analysis can be extended to higher - order interactions .",
    "one may consider , for example , the three - body interactions @xmath33 .",
    "the allowed three - boson states are @xmath34 ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath35 ( @xmath26 ) , @xmath36 ( @xmath28 ) and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , leading to @xmath39 independent three - body interactions for @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "note that any three - boson state @xmath40 is fully characterized by its angular momentum @xmath41 ; this is no longer the case for higher boson numbers when additional labels must be introduced .",
    "the number of possible interactions at each order @xmath29 is summarized in table  [ t_numint ] for up to @xmath42 .",
    "lcrcrcr order & & + & & total & & type i@xmath43 & & type ii@xmath44 + @xmath45 & & 1 & & 1 & & 0 + @xmath46 & & 2 & & 1 & & 1 + @xmath47 & & 7 & & 2 & & 5 + @xmath42 & & 17 & & 7 & & 10 +   +    some of these interactions exclusively contribute to the binding energy and do not influence the excitation spectrum of a nucleus . to determine the number of such interactions , one notes that the hamiltonian @xmath48 for constant boson number ( _ i.e. _ , a single nucleus ) essentially reduces to the @xmath49-body hamiltonian @xmath50 .",
    "consequently , of the @xmath51 independent interactions of order @xmath29 contained in @xmath52 , @xmath53 terms of the type @xmath48 must be discarded if one wishes to retain only those that influence the excitation energies .",
    "for example , given that there is one term of order zero ( _ i.e. _ , a constant ) , one of the two first - order terms ( _ i.e. _ , the combination @xmath54 ) does not influence the excitation spectrum . likewise , there are two first - order terms ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) and hence two of the seven two - body interactions do not influence the excitation spectrum .",
    "this argument leads to the numbers quoted in table  [ t_numint ] .",
    "we conclude that , in the nucleus - by - nucleus fits that will be performed in this work , there is a single one - boson energy of relevance , as well as five two - body and ten three - body interactions .",
    "this number of independent terms is too high for practical applications and simplifications must be sought on the basis of physical , empirical or formal arguments .",
    "some of them are based on the classical limit of the to which we now turn .",
    "the coherent - state formalism  @xcite represents a bridge between algebraic and geometric nuclear models .",
    "the central outcome of the formalism is that for any hamiltonian a corresponding potential @xmath57 can be constructed where @xmath2 and @xmath0 parametrize the intrinsic quadrupole deformation of the nucleus  @xcite .",
    "this procedure is known as the classical limit of the .",
    "the coherent states used for obtaining the classical limit of the are of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the boson vacuum and @xmath60 are five complex variables .",
    "these have the interpretation of ( quadrupole ) shape variables and their associated conjugate momenta .",
    "if one limits oneself to static problems , the @xmath60 can be taken as real ; they specify a shape and are analogous to the shape variables of the droplet model of the nucleus  @xcite . the @xmath60 can be related to three euler angles which define the orientation of an intrinsic frame of reference , and two intrinsic shape variables , @xmath2 and @xmath0 , that parametrize quadrupole vibrations of the nuclear surface around an equilibrium shape . in terms of the latter variables , the coherent state  ( [ e_coh ] )",
    "is rewritten as @xmath61 \\right)^n|{\\rm o}\\rangle .",
    "\\label{e_cohb}\\ ] ] the expectation value of the hamiltonian  ( [ e_ham ] ) in this state can be determined by elementary methods  @xcite and yields a function of @xmath2 and @xmath0 which is identified with a potential @xmath57 , familiar from the geometric model . in this way",
    "the following classical limit of the hamiltonian  ( [ e_ham ] ) is found : @xmath62 where the non - zero coefficients @xmath63 of order @xmath46 , 2 and 3 are given by @xmath64 in terms of the single boson energies @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and the matrix elements between normalized two- and three - body states , @xmath65 the expressions  ( [ e_climit ] ) and ( [ e_coeff ] ) will be useful for making a choice between the many possible three - body interactions .      from a great number of standard studies  @xcite",
    "one has a good idea of a workable hamiltonian with up to two - body interactions which is of the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the quadrupole operator with components @xmath68^{(2)}_\\mu+ \\chi[d^\\dag\\times\\tilde d]^{(2)}_\\mu , \\label{e_quad}\\ ] ] and @xmath69 is the angular momentum operator , @xmath70^{(1)}_\\mu$ ] .",
    "the @xmath71 and @xmath72 terms in  ( [ e_ham12 ] ) constitute the hamiltonian of the so - called consistent-@xmath73 formalism ( cqf )  @xcite .",
    "its eigenfunctions are fully determined by @xmath74 which for @xmath75 gives rise to the deformed or su(3 ) limit and for @xmath76 to the @xmath0-unstable or so(6 ) limit . in an extended consistent-@xmath73 formalism ( ecqf )  @xcite a further term @xmath56 is added with which the third , vibrational or u(5 ) limit of the can be obtained .",
    "the ecqf hamiltonian thus allows one to reach all three limits of the model with four parameters . in some nuclei an additional term @xmath77",
    "further improves the description of the excitation spectrum .",
    "the effect of this term with @xmath78 is an increase of the moment of inertia with increasing angular momentum ( or @xmath1-boson seniority @xmath79 ) .",
    "this so - called ` @xmath79-compression ' has been used for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the calculation of electric quadrupole properties",
    "an e2 transition operator is needed . in the it",
    "is defined as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is an effective charge for the bosons . in cqf",
    "the quadrupole operator in the e2 operator and in the hamiltonian are the same  @xcite , that is , they contain the same @xmath74 .",
    "many nuclear properties can be correctly described by the relatively simple hamiltonian  ( [ e_ham12 ] ) but some can not .",
    "a notable example is the even ",
    "odd staggering in the @xmath0 band of nuclei that are close to the so(6 ) limit .",
    "a characteristic feature of the @xmath0-unstable limit of the is a bunching of @xmath0-band states  @xcite according to @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 ,  , that is , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are close in energy , _ etc_. this even ",
    "odd staggering is observed in certain so(6 ) nuclei but not in all and in some it is , in fact , replaced by the opposite bunching @xmath87 , @xmath88 ,  , which is typical of a rigid triaxial rotor  @xcite . from these qualitative observations",
    "it is clear that the even ",
    "odd @xmath0-band staggering is governed by the @xmath0 degree of freedom ( _ i.e. _ , triaxiality ) as it changes character in the transition from a @xmath0-soft vibrator to a rigid triaxial rotor .",
    "a proper description of triaxiality in the must necessarily involve higher - order interactions as can be shown from the expressions given in sect .",
    "[ ss_climit ] .",
    "the minimum of the potential @xmath57 in  ( [ e_climit ] ) ( which can be thought of as the equilibrium shape of the nucleus ) of an hamiltonian with up to two - body interactions is either spherical ( @xmath89 ) , prolate deformed ( @xmath90 ) or oblate deformed ( @xmath91 ) . the lowest term in  ( [ e_climit ] ) with a triaxial extremum is quadratic in @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) and this requires a non - zero @xmath94 coefficient . from the explicit expressions given in eqs .",
    "( [ e_coeff ] ) it is seen that the lowest - order interactions possibly leading to a triaxial minimum in @xmath57 are thus necessarily of the form @xmath95^{(\\lambda)}\\times d^\\dag]^{(l ) } \\cdot [ [ \\tilde d\\times\\tilde d]^{(\\lambda')}\\times\\tilde d]^{(l ) } , \\label{e_ham3}\\ ] ] where the allowed angular momenta are @xmath38 . for several @xmath41 more than one combination of intermediate angular momenta @xmath96 and @xmath97",
    "is possible ; these do not give rise to independent terms but differ by a scale factor . to avoid the confusion caused by this scale factor , we rewrite the hamiltonian  ( [ e_ham3 ] ) as @xmath98^{(\\lambda)}\\times d^\\dag]^{(l)}_m .",

    "two main conclusions can be drawn from this work .",
    "first , very accurate nucleus - by - nucleus fits can be achieved with the simplified hamiltonian  ( [ e_ham12 ] ) to which a single three - body interaction of the type  ( [ e_ham3 ] ) is added . in almost all @xmath0-soft nuclei studied the inclusion of the @xmath110 interaction yields a consistently better description of the signature splitting of the @xmath0 band .",
    "this improved description of the @xmath0-band energies is obtained while maintaining good agreement for the e2-decay properties .",
    "nevertheless , no systematics of three - body parameters could be established . while we have currently a good working hamiltonian which includes up to two - body interactions and which describes nuclei throughout the nuclear chart , little",
    "is known of the overall trends for three - body interactions .",
    "a second conclusion concerns the geometry underlying the algebraic hamiltonians , as was illustrated with several examples",
    ". one surprising outcome of our approach is that an unbiased fit of energy levels in some nuclei ( @xmath111pd , @xmath112xe , @xmath113ba and @xmath114pt ) leads to an hamiltonian of which the classical limit yields a potential with a spherical minimum whereas these nuclei usually are considered @xmath0 soft and weakly deformed .",
    "the additional three - body interaction @xmath115 , introduced to improve the description of the @xmath0 band , makes the potential energy surface @xmath57 softer in @xmath0 for @xmath116 and more rigid for @xmath117 .",
    "the sign of this coefficient follows from the staggering pattern of the @xmath0 band .",
    "finally , in none of the nuclei studied we found evidence for a triaxial minimum .",
    "we wish to thank adrian gelberg for his valuable comments on this work ."
