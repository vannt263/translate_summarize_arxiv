    "the study of hadronic properties at finite temperature @xmath2 is one of the theoretical ingredients needed to understand the behaviour of matter created in relativistic heavy ion collision experiments , such as those in rhic and lhc ( alice ) . in particular , the qcd transition involving chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement plays a crucial role , as it is clear from the many recent advances of lattice groups in the study of the phase diagram and other thermodynamical properties @xcite .    for vanishing baryon chemical potential ,",
    "the qcd transition is a crossover for 2 + 1 flavours with physical quark masses , the transition temperature being about @xmath5 150 -160 mev . in the chiral limit ( vanishing light quark masses for fixed strange mass )",
    "it is believed to become a second - order phase transition belonging to the universality class of the @xmath6 model @xcite .",
    "lattice simulations also support this fact .",
    "actually , in @xcite it is shown that the lattice results are compatible with a @xmath7-like restoration pattern in the chiral limit and for physical masses , by studying the scaling of different thermodynamical observables near @xmath8 .",
    "the expected reduction in the transition temperature from the physical mass case to the chiral limit one based on those analysis is about 15 - 20@xmath9 , although subject to many lattice uncertainties @xcite .    from the theoretical side , it is important to provide solid analysis of this chiral restoration pattern based on effective theories , given the limitations of perturbative qcd at those temperature scales .",
    "a simple model realization was historically the linear sigma model ( lsm ) based on @xmath10 spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite , where the @xmath11-component of the @xmath6 field acquires a thermal vacuum expectation value and mass , both of them vanish at the transition in the chiral limit , and @xmath12 mesons degenerate as chiral partners .",
    "however , such a simple description is nowadays in conflict with observations : on the one hand , the @xmath13 broad resonance produced in pion - pion scattering and listed in the pdg @xcite is not compatible with a particle - like state ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . on the other hand , to reproduce consistently pion data , the lsm requires working in a strong coupling regime , invalidating the perturbative description .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the @xmath14 state must play an important role in chiral restoration , since it shares the quantum numbers of the qcd vacuum .",
    "chiral symmetry restoration has also been studied within qcd inspired models like the nambu - jona - lasinio or gross - neveu ones @xcite .    a systematic and model - independent framework that takes into account the relevant light meson degrees of freedom and their interactions is chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite .",
    "the effective chpt lagrangian is constructed as a derivative and mass expansion @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes generically a meson energy scale compared to the chiral scale @xmath17 1 gev .",
    "the lowest order lagrangian @xmath18 is the non - linear sigma model ( nlsm ) .",
    "the use of energy expansions in chiral effective theories is also justified at finite temperature to describe heavy ion physics .",
    "pions are actually the most copiously produced particles after a heavy ion collision and most of their properties from hadronization to thermal freeze - out can be reasonably described within the temperature range where these theories are applicable .",
    "thus , the chiral restoring behaviour in terms of the quark condensate is qualitatively obtained within chpt @xcite .",
    "moreover , the introduction of realistic pion interactions by demanding unitarity through the inverse amplitude method ( iam ) @xcite extended at finite @xmath2 @xcite improves chpt , providing a more accurate description of several effects of interest in a heavy - ion environment , such as thermal resonances , transport coefficients and electromagnetic corrections @xcite .",
    "this approach also provides a novel understanding of the role of the @xmath13 broad resonant state in chiral symmetry restoration , without having to deal with the typical lsm drawbacks .",
    "thus , the unitarized @xmath19 scattering amplitude within chpt at finite temperature develops a @xmath20 thermal pole at @xmath21 ^ 2 $ ] , which for @xmath3 corresponds to the pdg state , and whose trajectory in the complex plane as @xmath2 varies shows some interesting features : the sudden drop of @xmath22 towards the two - pion threshold can be interpreted in terms of chiral symmetry restoration , as opposed for instance to the @xmath23 @xmath24-channel where the mass drop is much softer .",
    "in addition , it has been recently shown @xcite that the scalar susceptibility saturated with this @xmath11-like state , with squared mass @xmath25 , develops a maximum near @xmath26 compatible with lattice data , unlike the pure chpt prediction which is monotonically increasing .",
    "moreover , chiral partners in the scalar - pseudoscalar sector are understood through degeneration of correlators and susceptibilities @xcite , something which is also directly seen in lattice data @xcite . the role of the @xmath4 state for chiral restoration could become more complicated if its possible tetraquark component is also considered at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "a crucial step in the unitarized approach is the condition of exact thermal unitarity for the partial waves , with a thermal space factor modified by the bose - einstein distribution function .",
    "this condition holds perturbatively in chpt @xcite and the unitarized amplitude is constructed by requiring thermal unitarity to all orders , based on the physical collision processes occurring in the thermal bath @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to emphasize that thermal unitarity for the full amplitude was not formally proven in those works ; in fact , that will be one of the relevant issues discussed in the present work .",
    "although the approaches based on effective theories in terms of the lightest mesons provide a good description of the physics involved , especially in what concerns the effect of the lightest resonances ( as discussed above ) , a more accurate treatment near @xmath26 would require including heavier degrees of freedom .",
    "that is for instance the framework of the hadron resonance gas , which describes the system through the statistical ensemble of all free states thermally available , and where corrections due to interactions and lattice masses can be also accounted for @xcite .",
    "effective chiral models including explicitly vector and axial - vector resonances have also been successfully used to depict several hadron thermal properties relevant for observables such as the dilepton and photon spectra and @xmath27 mixing / degeneration at the chiral transition @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will consider an alternative approach to the thermal pion scattering amplitude , namely the limit of large number of nambu - goldstone bosons @xmath1 , or in other words , large number of light flavours with no strangeness , as treated before at @xmath3 in @xcite .",
    "previous large-@xmath1 analysis at @xmath28 can be found in @xcite . within this framework , the lowest order chiral effective lagrangian for low - energy qcd will be the @xmath0 nlsm , whose corresponding symmetry breaking pattern is @xmath29 .",
    "as we have just commented , the latter is believed to take place in chiral symmetry restoration for @xmath30 , since @xmath6 and @xmath31 are respectively isomorphic to the isospin groups @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this technique has the advantage of allowing for a partial resummation of the scattering amplitude preserving many physical properties such as unitarity and the dynamical generation of the @xmath4 pole , which will help us to shed more light on the chiral restoring issues discussed before .",
    "we will work in the chiral limit , since it simplifies considerably the analysis , besides enhancing chiral - restoring effects , as explained above . at this point , it is important to remark that massless pions remain massless at finite temperature @xcite , unlike many other instances in thermal field theory where elementary massless excitations acquire mass in the thermal bath , like high-@xmath2 fermions @xcite , gauge fields @xcite including large-@xmath34 analysis @xcite or when electromagnetic corrections are switched on @xcite .",
    "the study of the large-@xmath1 approach in low - energy qcd implies a simplification of the pion dynamics @xcite without changing essential features such as analyticity , unitarity and the low - energy behaviour for pion scattering .",
    "this is fully accomplished when working in the functional formalism of the theory @xcite so that the lagrangian is built as @xmath35 covariant and @xmath36 invariant ( in the chiral limit ) .",
    "furthermore , as we will see in detail here , this approach will allow to describe consistently the @xmath4 state through its pole in the second riemann sheet , where the parameters of the model are fitted to pion - pion scattering phase shift data .",
    "thanks to the fact that the model is exactly unitary , we will be granted to go beyond the standard perturbative chpt description for the scattering @xcite , as a complementary description of unitarization methods such as the iam .",
    "an additional observation that makes this approach suitable for studying chiral restoring effects is that in order to reproduce correctly the @xmath37 pole ( linked to chiral restoration as mentioned before ) , the dominant contributions to @xmath19 scattering are the loop diagrams from the leading order chiral lagrangian , rather than the particular form of higher order terms needed to renormalize the amplitude @xcite .",
    "thus , the large-@xmath1 limit framework provides a resummation of the dominant loop contributions needed to maintain exact unitarity , so that the scalar pole can be correctly described .    with the above motivations kept in mind",
    ", we will analyze in this work elastic pion - pion scattering at finite temperature within the large-@xmath1 @xmath0 model in the chiral limit .",
    "we will show that at @xmath3 one gets reasonable values for the @xmath37 pole from a fit to experimental data of a two - parameter partial wave .",
    "the extension to @xmath28 includes a formal discussion of the renormalizability of the model , which as expected can be carried out in terms of @xmath3 counterterms , although with important subtleties to be taken into account .",
    "the important feature of exact unitarity is demonstrated , including thermal corrections , something that allows us to define the second - sheet pole .",
    "having fixed the @xmath3 pole position , its @xmath2 dependence is obtained and it is shown that the results are compatible with a second - order chiral restoring phase transition , consistently with previous determinations and lattice data .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : scattering ] we introduce our large @xmath1 approach within the framework of the massless nlsm and work out the diagrammatic expansion for pion scattering , both at zero and at finite temperature ; section [ sec : ren ] is devoted to explain the renormalization procedure , for which technical details are relegated to appendix [ app : ren ] . in section [ sec : pw ]",
    "we perform the analysis of the @xmath20 partial wave , providing a fit to @xmath3 data and showing that the large-@xmath1 amplitude satisfies exactly unitarity at zero and finite temperature .",
    "the latter grants us to define the riemann second - sheet pole corresponding to the @xmath4 state , which we study in detail in section [ sec : pole ] , paying special attention to its thermal evolution and the connection with chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in a theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking @xmath29 , the coset space where the nambu - goldstone bosons ( ngb ) are defined is the @xmath1-dimensional sphere @xmath38 . in such a theory ,",
    "the most general @xmath36-invariant and @xmath39 covariant lagrangian in the chiral limit can be obtained as a derivative expansion of the ngb modes , whose lowest order expression is given by the nlsm @xcite :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is a metric in the @xmath39 manifold which is parametrized in the ngb @xmath42 coordinates as    @xmath43    with @xmath44 .    as explained in @xcite ,",
    "the advantage of choosing a @xmath39 covariant formalism is that we can easily construct @xmath36 invariant lagrangians of higher order by properly contracting indices with the @xmath45 metric .",
    "in addition , this formalism ensures the independence of the green functions on ngb field reparametrizations , i.e. , when changing coordinates in @xmath46 .",
    "the covariance of the quantum model is guaranteed as long as we work in the dimensional regularization ( dr ) scheme with @xmath47 , since the metric factor appearing in the ngb quantum measure @xmath48 , with @xmath49 the metric determinant , amounts to add to the lagrangian a term proportional to @xmath50 @xcite which vanishes in dr @xcite .",
    "although there is no need to invoke the lsm in the above construction , one can understand the nlsm as the kinetic part of the lsm when the vacuum constraint @xmath51 is imposed , where @xmath52 is the vacuum expectation value acquired by the @xmath11 field at tree level . in that way , it is easy to understand the @xmath1-scaling of the @xmath53 constant , where @xmath54 is the pion decay constant at this order for the usual @xmath30 case @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian provides the standard kinetic term for the ngb fields and along with it , an infinite set of self - interaction terms with an arbitrary even number of ngb .",
    "these interactions are obtained when the metric ( [ metric ] ) is expanded and written as a function of two field derivatives and powers of the pion field .",
    "hence , to obtain the relevant feynman rules for pion scattering , we can write the lagrangian ( [ nlsm ] ) as follows :    @xmath55 . \\label{lagrangian1}\\ ] ]        the first term in the latter expansion gives the standard kinetic lagrangian and the rest are the @xmath56-vertices with @xmath57 , represented in fig .",
    "[ treel ] .",
    "the feynman rule in momentum space for each vertex is @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 the isospin indices of all possible choices of four different lines in the diagram and where the dots indicate the rest of pair contractions , i.e. , all products @xmath61 with @xmath62 the isospin indices of pairs different from @xmath63 and @xmath64 . with these rules ,",
    "we proceed to calculate the @xmath65 scattering that , as customary , is parametrized as :    @xmath66    here , @xmath67 are the mandelstam variables @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and use of isospin and crossing symmetry has been made to parametrize the amplitude .",
    "we will denote @xmath71 .",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath72 in the large-@xmath1 limit comes from the diagrams showed in fig .",
    "[ 4pioneff ] .",
    "thus , when considering diagrams of arbitrary loop order with just the four pion vertex in fig.[treel ] , the dominant contribution of isospin flux is that where the pairs of lines are chosen as @xmath73 for an internal vertex , i.e. , with no attachments to any external line ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the four - momenta of the loops attached to that vertex ) and @xmath76 for the external ones . in that way , an additional factor of @xmath1 is generated for every pair of vertices between a given loop , coming from a contraction @xmath77 , where @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) is one of the two free indices in the first ( second ) vertex .",
    "the result is a net factor @xmath80 for every vertex and an additional @xmath1 for every loop , so that the resulting amplitude is @xmath81 .",
    "other loop contributions are subdominant according to this counting .        for those vertices in fig.[treel ] with more than four pions , the only way to compensate the additional @xmath82 factors of the @xmath56-pion vertex is to close @xmath83 of them in tadpole - like contributions , giving rise to a @xmath84 factor , so that this contribution would count the same @xmath85 as the four - pion vertex .",
    "those tadpole insertions correspond to fields sharing the same isospin index with no derivatives , since @xmath86 , with @xmath87 the free pion propagator . at @xmath3 ,",
    "they actually vanish , since the tadpole contribution @xmath88 in the chiral limit .",
    "that will be not the case at @xmath89 , as we discuss in section [ sec : diagft ] and will become one of the main novelties of the present calculation . finally ,",
    "note also that in the chiral limit , the pion propagator is not corrected by loop effects and hence needs no renormalization @xcite . for instance , a tadpole correction to the self - energy would require contracting two pion lines with the same isospin index to produce a @xmath1 factor , but that gives @xmath86 , and other contributions are non - dominant with respect to the tree level propagator , which is @xmath90 .    from the latter considerations , and after including the proper combinatoric factors",
    ", the @xmath72 function in ( [ generalt ] ) depends only on @xmath91 to leading order in @xmath85 , which is actually one of the main simplifications of this approach , and is given by    @xmath92= \\frac{s}{nf^{2}}\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\left[\\frac{s j(s)}{2f^2}\\right]^k= \\frac{s}{nf^{2}[1-s\\,j(s)/2f^{2 } ] } , \\label{zerotamp}\\ ] ]    where @xmath93 is the usual logarithmically - divergent loop integral that in the dr scheme reads @xcite    @xmath94    and @xmath95 contains the divergent part :    @xmath96+{{\\cal o}}(\\epsilon ) .",

    "note that we follow the convention in @xcite to define the pole contribution @xmath100 but we include the @xmath101 contribution in the divergent part , unlike in @xcite , in order to compare easily with previous large-@xmath1 works @xcite .",
    "we recall that for @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( i.e. , above the two - pion threshold which in the chiral limit is at @xmath104 ) we can easily obtain the imaginary parts of the loop integral as the usual unitarity cut contribution ( see section [ sec : unit ] ) :    @xmath105    while @xmath106 for @xmath107 .    in section [ sec : ren ]",
    "we will discuss the renormalization procedure implemented to absorb the divergent part ( [ jepsilon ] ) , but before that , let us explain the main distinctive features of the @xmath28 calculation .",
    "we will work within the imaginary - time formalism of thermal field theory @xcite so that the thermal scattering amplitude is understood as the analytic continuation to continuous energies of the corresponding four - point green function after performing the loop matsubara sums and applying the lsz standard reduction formula for @xmath3 asymptotic states @xcite .    comparing with the analysis performed in the previous section ,",
    "the first observation is that the absence of renormalization for the pion propagator remains the same at @xmath28 , so pions do not acquire effective thermal masses , following the same diagrammatic argument as before .",
    "however , there is an important difference with the @xmath3 case and is that the tadpole contribution is now different from zero in the chiral limit , namely @xcite :    @xmath108    with the matsubara frequencies @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "this means that from now on , the diagrams coming from closing pairs of extra pion lines in the vertices with 6 or more legs in fig.[treel ] have to be considered . to accomplish this in an efficient way",
    ", we construct the effective thermal tadpole vertex given in fig.[effvertx ] , and we rebuild the scattering amplitude to all perturbative orders with the associated feynman rule of the thermal vertex , something that we show schematically in fig.[finitetamp ] .",
    "in addition , we have to take into account that the loop integral is also @xmath2-dependent , so that the thermal amplitude to leading order in @xmath85 is given by    @xmath111    which depends now separately on the space and time components of @xmath16 due to the loss of lorentz covariance in the thermal bath .",
    "the vertex function reads    @xmath112    and the finite-@xmath2 loop integral @xmath113 is the analytic continuation of the external matsubara frequency @xmath114 of    @xmath115    where @xmath116 in ( [ js ] ) .",
    "explicit expressions for the above @xmath117 integral for arbitrary three - momentum @xmath118 can be found for instance in @xcite .",
    "its uv divergent part is the same as for @xmath3 , since bose - einstein factors regulate exponentially the uv behaviour , so that we will write in general    @xmath119    with @xmath95 in and @xmath120 finite and whose scale dependence is contained only in the @xmath3 part , namely @xmath121 .    in this work we will be interested only in calculations in the center of mass frame ( corresponding to @xmath122 ) , where partial waves are defined ( see section [ sec : pw ] ) and moreover , we have @xcite    @xmath123    where @xmath124 and @xmath125 is the usual bose - einstein distribution function @xmath126    note that @xmath127 is uv finite ( @xmath128 ) thanks to the @xmath129 term ; besides , we can easily separate the real and imaginary parts of @xmath127 for @xmath102 and @xmath130 by isolating the pole contribution at @xmath131 in the integrand in ( [ jthermal2 ] ) as    @xmath132    while for @xmath107 there is no pole in the integrand in ( [ jthermal2 ] ) .",
    "finally , we recall that for @xmath133 , @xmath127 is ir finite ( @xmath134 ) while for @xmath135 , it diverges as @xmath136 so that @xmath137 ( as it appears in the thermal amplitude ( [ thermalampbare ] ) ) remains finite ( and vanishing ) in that limit .",
    "we will first review the main points regarding the renormalization of the model in the @xmath3 case , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the scattering amplitude can be renormalized by choosing an appropriate ( infinite ) set of counterterm lagrangians of higher orders in derivatives and summing their contribution to the amplitude to all orders .",
    "the philosophy behind this approach is to include only those lagrangians needed to obtain a renormalized amplitude to leading order in @xmath85 , although from the symmetry arguments explained above , many other operator structures are possible .",
    "consistently , we can consider formally the couplings , or low - energy constants ( lec ) of those additional lagrangians to be suppressed in the @xmath85 counting .",
    "in the conventional chpt approach @xcite all possible terms are included to a given order in the derivative / momentum expansion and then the lec are fixed with experimental data , although the predictions are limited to low energies .",
    "the energy applicability range can be enlarged when additional conditions such as unitarization are implemented , and then the lec can take in general different values from the perturbative ones .",
    "here we are considering a partial resummation of the series for the amplitude , namely the leading @xmath85 contribution , which in the end can be given in a finite form that depends only on a few parameters , to be fixed to experimental data .",
    "nevertheless , there will be some important subtleties to be taken into account in the @xmath28 case , as we will explain below , in order to ensure a renormalized amplitude with a @xmath3 renormalization scheme .",
    "we will discuss the main results in this section , while additional details are given in appendix [ app : ren ] .",
    "let us consider , for instance , the possible counterterms lagrangians to fourth - order in derivatives .",

    "the lec multiplying the two allowed terms are the counterpart of the @xmath142 constants of chpt @xcite .",
    "the main result at @xmath3 is that the scattering amplitude can be rendered finite by a set of infinite counterterm lagrangians which to @xmath143 have the form",
    "@xcite    @xmath144 .",
    "\\label{lk}\\ ] ]    this reduces to for @xmath145 .",
    "it is indeed always possible to find at each order an adequate contraction with the @xmath45 metric that gives rise to the terms ( [ lk ] ) , for instance @xmath146 .",
    "consistently , the lec multiplying other possible terms such as @xmath147 can be considered formally suppressed in the @xmath85 counting .",
    "the dominant contributions of the new terms to the amplitude in the @xmath85 counting arise from all possible @xmath148 insertions in diagrams of the form showed in fig.[fig : insertions ] .",
    "it is actually not difficult to see that with the covariant structures discussed above , the @xmath149 terms and higher in give subdominant contributions , which also holds at @xmath28 .",
    "as it is explained in appendix [ app : ren ] , each lagrangian ( [ lk ] ) insertion produces a @xmath150 power in the vertex at @xmath3 .",
    "thus , summing up all the possible @xmath148 insertions in the dominant loop diagrams in fig.[fig : insertions ] is equivalent to the following redefinition of the four - pion vertex @xcite :    @xmath151    with @xmath152 , which gives for the @xmath3 amplitude :    @xmath153    or equivalently ,    @xmath154 , \\label{invamp0}\\ ] ]    written in a more suitable way to implement its renormalization , as we discuss below .",
    "now , we can renormalize the bare divergent ( and scale independent ) lec @xmath155 correctly to absorb order by order the loop divergences coming from the @xmath93 function .",
    "thus , we denote @xmath156 for @xmath157 the renormalized ( and scale dependent ) couplings that are renormalized in terms of the @xmath158 with @xmath159 ( see details in appendix [ app : ren ] ) .",
    "equivalently , we define the renormalized function    @xmath160    which replaced in gives rise to the renormalized amplitude :    @xmath161    where the subscript @xmath162 is merely added to emphasize that the amplitude is finite .",
    "recall also that the renormalized amplitude is independent of the scale @xmath99 , since it was so from the original expression , the scale dependence of @xmath163 being cancelled by that of the renormalized @xmath156 .",
    "the function @xmath164 can also be written as a formal series in powers of @xmath91 by expanding both sides of eq .",
    "so that    @xmath165    taking @xmath166 would give the order - by - order renormalization of the @xmath155 , presented explicitly in appendix [ app : ren ] up to @xmath167 ( specifically and ) .    at @xmath89 , from general grounds , we should be able to renormalize the amplitude with @xmath3 counterterms @xcite .",
    "however , we notice that only with the renormalization of the four - pion vertex in and is not enough to renormalize the thermal amplitude in ( even though the divergent part of the @xmath117 integral is the same as at @xmath3 ) unless powers of @xmath168 were attached to the counterterm lagrangians , something that would violate the above mentioned @xmath89 renormalization principle . actually , things become more complicated , since the feynman rules arising from terms like are not as simple as the @xmath3 ones , which in particular means that a given diagram mixes different @xmath169 powers .    in appendix",
    "[ app : ren ] we present a detailed analysis of the renormalization scheme that has to be applied to the @xmath28 case .",
    "the main conclusion is that the thermal amplitude can be rendered finite with a @xmath3 renormalization where not only the four - point vertex is involved , but also all @xmath170-pion vertices of the nlsm lagrangian for arbitrary integer @xmath171 as follows :    @xmath172    the above renormalization , which can be understood either in terms of an addition of effective diagrams renormalizing the vertices or as a formal renormalization of the metric function at the lagrangian level ( see appendix [ app : ren ] ) , amounts to the redefinition of the effective thermal vertex in fig.[effvertx ] as given in when the corresponding tadpole diagrams are summed up .",
    "in fact , one can also arrive to the same four - pion effective vertex renormalization in starting by redefining the thermal effective vertex with an unknown bare function of @xmath91 and @xmath2 that absorbs the divergent part of the @xmath117 integral in the total amplitude .",
    "thus , we finally have for the thermal amplitude :    @xmath173}{nf^2}\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{s g_{0}(s)f[g_{0}(s ) i_\\beta]}{2f^2}j(p;t)}.\\ ] ]    after using exactly the same renormalization method given in , we obtain a finite renormalized thermal amplitude given by    @xmath174}{nf^2}\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{s g_{r}(s;\\mu)f[g_{r}(s;\\mu ) i_\\beta]}{2f^2}j_{fin}(p;t;\\mu ) } , \\label{renampt}\\ ] ]    where @xmath175 is the finite part of the thermal @xmath117 function , defined in",
    ".    recall that our final finite thermal amplitude is also independent of the @xmath99 scale , as in the @xmath3 case , since the dependence in @xmath175 cancels out that of @xmath164 encoded by the finite renormalization constants @xmath176 through .",
    "we point out also that the renormalization scheme discussed here is the same as for @xmath3 and is of course consistent with the previous analysis of the scattering amplitude in the large-@xmath1 nlsm in @xcite , but at @xmath3 it is enough to consider the four - point vertex renormalization because the @xmath170 vertices with @xmath157 simply do not show up in the scattering amplitude at leading @xmath85 order .",
    "the renormalized thermal amplitude is one of our main results .",

    "indeed , at @xmath3 one can for instance choose the @xmath177 to recover the amplitude of the lsm with explicit exchange of a scalar particle",
    ". an alternative approach , which is the one we will follow here , is to fix the scale and the renormalization conditions such as only a finite number of the @xmath177 are nonzero . in its simplest version , we can choose @xmath178 .",

    ". that will be enough for our present purposes , since our main goal is to show that with a @xmath3 amplitude which complies with the above physical requirements , we can obtain a thermal behaviour compatible with different theoretical and lattice expectations regarding chiral symmetry restoration , as we discuss in section [ sec : pole ] .",
    "it is also important to stress that following the guide principle that the @xmath3 renormalization should be enough to render a finite amplitude ( proven perturbatively up to @xmath167 in appendix [ app : ren ] ) , the insertion of counterterms with bare renormalization constants @xmath182 , the subsequent absorption of the divergent part of the loop integrals to define the @xmath183 and taking @xmath184 , would have been equivalent to take the thermal amplitude with @xmath117 replaced by @xmath175 . what we have derived here",
    "is an explicit construction of such a renormalization scheme .    to end this section and before proceeding with the analysis of partial waves and thermal poles , we provide a first result related to the pion decay constant at finite temperature .",
    "taking the low - energy limit of the thermal amplitude from its general renormalized form gives simply :    @xmath185    which we can compare with the low - energy expression of the scattering amplitude given by weinberg s theorem @xcite to define a @xmath2-dependent pion decay constant , namely ,    @xmath186    so that : @xmath187 ( n=3 ) . \\label{fpit}\\ ] ] where we have used that @xmath188 .",

    "a more careful analysis of @xmath190 beyond @xmath191 would require to analyze the residue of the axial - axial correlator @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , we will fix the undetermined constants in the scattering amplitude from experimental information . for that purpose and for the subsequent analysis of the @xmath4 pole and chiral restoration",
    ", we will consider partial waves with well - defined values of total isospin @xmath192 and angular momentum @xmath117 , which at @xmath3 are defined in the center of mass ( com ) frame @xmath122 :    @xmath193    where @xmath194 are legendre polynomials , @xmath195 is the scattering angle and @xmath196 is a particular combination involving @xmath72 ( defined in ) which gives the scattering amplitude at given isospin @xmath192 , with @xmath197 , @xmath198 in the com frame .",
    "the large-@xmath1 analysis is specially adequate for the @xmath20 channel ( see below ) , which on the other hand is the one we are interested in this work . in that case",

    "the final result is that the @xmath20 partial wave is independent of @xmath1 ( to leading order ) . at @xmath3",
    "we have then :    @xmath201    recall that within the large-@xmath1 framework , the other possible isospin channels for pion scattering , namely @xmath202 and @xmath203 , are subdominant , since they are proportional to @xmath85 .",
    "this analysis is therefore particularly suited for @xmath204 @xcite which for the thermal case is the most relevant one regarding chiral symmetry restoration from the point of view of thermodynamic quantities such as the scalar susceptibility , as explained above .    as discussed in section [ sec : ren ] , we will work within the minimal approach for which @xmath205 for @xmath157 so that we end up with the @xmath3 partial wave in with @xmath206 .",
    "defining the phase shift as customary for elastic channels @xmath207 , we can use this result to try to fit experimental phase shift data .",
    "there are several comments that are pertinent at this point : first , the choice of data sets is delicate because there have been several experiments over the years with results sometimes incompatible among them for this channel .",
    "in addition , we have to take into account that we are working in the chiral limit , so that we expect our amplitude to describe more naturally data sufficiently away from threshold , i.e. , typically for large @xmath208 . on the other hand , there is also a natural upper limit of applicability for @xmath209 , namely below the next resonance mass in this channel , which is the @xmath210 .",
    "this would need the inclusion of the strange sector .",
    "thus , we have chosen as data for the fit the sets given by @xcite in the @xmath209 range 450 - 800 mev .",
    "in addition , we consider also the parametrization of the scattering amplitude described in @xcite in the same energy region . that parametrization provides a precise description of @xmath19 scattering from a combined analysis based on dispersion relations and provides an accurate prediction of the @xmath4 and @xmath210 pole parameters .",
    "we do not include in the fit the recent ( and also more precise ) data of the na48 experiment @xcite which are very low - energy data below @xmath211 400 mev .",
    "those low - energy data are very well described by the parametrization @xcite . in the fit to the parametrization @xcite , we select points with a 5 mev energy interval and take into account the small uncertainties given in that paper .",
    "another important point is that in principle the values obtained for @xmath180 in our fits should not be far from the physical value of the pion decay constant @xmath212 . in the chiral limit , @xmath213 87 mev @xcite , so that @xmath180 would be around @xmath214 51 mev .",
    "however , once again it is important to stress that we are forcing our chiral limit amplitude to fit data for massive pions and it is then not surprising that we need a higher value for @xmath180 since mass corrections increase the @xmath190 value , so that we are encoding in @xmath180 a great part of the uncertainty we have in our chiral limit analysis .    in any case ,",
    "it is not the purpose of this work to provide a very precise fit to experimental data , as in other unitarized or dispersive approaches @xcite which can even be compared to lattice results by suitable mass extrapolations @xcite .",
    "after all , this is just a two - parameter fit in the chiral limit .",
    "we just need some reasonable reference values for the parameters such as we generate dynamically a pole in the second riemann sheet with consistent values for the pole position , so that the thermal behaviour corresponds to a physically realistic situation .    in fig.[phaseshift ]",

    "we can compare this analysis , on the one hand , with the exact result for the nonlinear @xmath7 model for @xmath217 in four dimensions , @xmath218 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the critical exponent of the @xmath6 three - dimensional heisenberg model , which lattice qcd results resemble within uncertainties @xcite , is @xmath219 0.54 for @xmath220 in the chiral limit @xcite . our results and the iam one lie close to those values , providing then a consistency check of our approach to define the scalar susceptibility from the @xmath4 pole .",
    "we have studied pion scattering in the large-@xmath1 @xmath0 model at finite temperature in the chiral limit and its consequences regarding the @xmath4 pole and chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "our analysis gives rise to interesting theoretical and phenomenological results , consistent with previous analysis and lattice data .    after calculating the relevant feynman diagrams , which include an effective thermal vertex from tadpole resummation , an important part of our work has been devoted to show that it is possible to find a renormalization scheme rendering the thermal amplitude finite with a @xmath3 renormalization of the corresponding vertices",
    "this is a nontrivial extension of the @xmath3 renormalization of the scattering amplitude , since the breaking of lorentz covariance in the thermal bath induces crossed terms between tadpole - like and @xmath221 loop functions . in the low - energy expansion of the model , up to @xmath167 ,",
    "we have checked explicitly this renormalization scheme , providing a diagrammatic and lagrangian interpretation .",
    "another relevant result is that the large-@xmath1 thermal amplitude satisfies exactly the thermal unitarity relation , imposed in previous works as a physical condition for the exact amplitude .",
    "its low - energy properties are also preserved , being consistent for instance with the thermal dependence of the pion decay constant .    by a suitable choice of the low - energy constants , similarly to the @xmath3 case , compatible with the scale evolution of the renormalized couplings , we end up with a phenomenological unitary amplitude depending only on two parameters , @xmath180 and @xmath99 . by fitting those parameters to experimental data in the @xmath20 channel , which is more reliable for data not very close to threshold in the elastic region",
    ", we reproduce the pole position of the @xmath4 in the second riemann sheet fairly consistently with pdg values and recent determinations .",
    "the chiral limit character of our approach implies a larger value for @xmath180 than phenomenologically expected , but it allows to obtain pole position parameters @xmath222 closer to the physical case .",
    "the fits to data are actually very good in the chosen region , precisely the most relevant energy range concerning this resonant state .",
    "once the @xmath3 pole has been fixed to physical values , we have studied its evolution with temperature .",
    "the @xmath4 pole remains a wide state for all the temperature range of interest , the real and imaginary parts @xmath223 and @xmath224 behaving similarly to the iam analysis , showing the signature of chiral restoration . in order to explore this further",
    ", we define a scalar susceptibility @xmath225 saturated by the inverse of @xmath226 , corresponding to the real part of the scalar state self - energy at zero four - momentum , which diverges at a given @xmath8 with a power law , as it corresponds to a continuous second - order phase transition in the chiral limit .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath8 , as well as the critical exponent of @xmath227 , are consistent with those obtained with other analytical approaches , such as the iam , and with lattice analysis , being compatible with a @xmath6 scaling .",
    "the combination of the large-@xmath1 framework with the phenomenological features of the @xmath4 pole allows to improve the predictions of previous approaches based on the partition function .",

    "note also that in , the two contributions @xmath263 cancel among them , and also independently by parity . however , this does not happen for @xmath264 , meaning that the @xmath252 s are not simply linear combinations of @xmath265 and @xmath255 as in the previous cases .",
    "for instance , for @xmath264 the following integral contributes :      with @xmath267 and @xmath268 . at @xmath3 ,",
    "one has @xmath269 in dr , but at @xmath28 the timelike and spacelike contributions decouple , from the loss of lorentz covariance in the thermal bath , and they are in general nonzero . besides ,      where we have made use of the standard feynman parametrization as well as poisson s summation formula @xmath271 . the function @xmath272 is defined in @xcite . on the other hand , using again the dr properties , @xmath273 .",
    "note that @xmath274 so that these pure thermal contributions would not give rise to new type of divergences , i.e. different from those coming from the standard loop integral in .    therefore , the feynman rules at @xmath28 for @xmath148 insertions change with respect to the @xmath3 ones .",
    "namely , a @xmath148 insertion in the generic diagram of fig.[fig : insertions ] produces an integral of the type for the internal loop momenta @xmath275 and then is not equivalent to a simple @xmath276 power as for @xmath3 .",
    "one of the consequences of the above results is that when considering all the diagrams contributing to a given @xmath276 order , the @xmath91 and @xmath277 powers mix , so that a larger number of diagrams has to be considered . in fig.[fig : finitetdiags3 ] we have displayed all the diagrams that would give @xmath167 contributions , all of them including @xmath140 and @xmath249 insertions according to the results and .",

    "<S> we consider the @xmath0 non - linear sigma model for large @xmath1 as an effective theory for low - energy qcd at finite temperature @xmath2 , in the chiral limit . at @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> this formulation provides a good description of scattering data in the scalar channel and generates dynamically the @xmath4 pole , the pole position lying within experimental determinations . </S>",
    "<S> previous @xmath3 results with this model are updated using newer analysis of pion scattering data . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the pion scattering amplitude at finite @xmath2 and show that it satisfies exactly thermal unitarity , which had been assumed but not formally proven in previous works . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the main differences with the @xmath3 result and we show that one can define a proper renormalization scheme with @xmath3 counterterms such that the renormalized amplitude can be chosen to depend only on a few parameters . </S>",
    "<S> next , we analyze the behaviour of the @xmath4 pole at finite @xmath2 , which is consistent with chiral symmetry restoration when the scalar susceptibility is saturated by the @xmath4 state , in a second - order transition scenario and in accordance with lattice and theoretical analysis . </S>"
