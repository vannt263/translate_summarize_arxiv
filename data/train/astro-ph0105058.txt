    "1e0102.2 - 7219 is a young ( @xmath01000 years ) supernova remnant ( snr ) in the small magellanic cloud .",
    "it was discovered in x - rays with the _ einstein _ observatory ( seward & mitchell 1981 ) , and shortly afterwards optical filaments of oxygen were found ( dopita et al . 1981 ) and measured to have velocities of thousands of km / s ( tuohy & dopita 1983 ) , pegging it as one of a small number of identified oxygen - rich snrs . as a class , these snrs are believed to come from supernovae with massive progenitors , exhibit high velocities in their optical filaments , are young ( with the possible exception of puppis a ) and often show evidence of asymmetrical explosion .",
    "e0102 - 72 has been observed in uv ( blair et al .",
    "1989 ; blair et al . 2000 ) and radio ( amy & ball 1993 ) , and in the x - ray with _",

    "2000 ; hughes et al . 2000 ) . based on early x - ray observations , hughes ( 1988 ) ruled out a uniform - density shell model . our data ( houck et al . 2000 ) and gaetz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) confirm hughes conclusion .",
    "gaetz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have looked at direct _",
    "chandra _ images of e0102 - 72 and noted the radial variation with energy bands centered on ovii and oviii , suggesting an ionizing shock propagating inward .",
    "the analysis of the high resolution dispersed spectrum , discussed below , reinforces this interpretation .",
    "in addition , doppler shifts in the high - resolution spectrum give us a first look at the velocity structure .",
    "the supernova remnant e0102 - 72 was observed with the _ chandra _ high energy transmission gratings ( hetg ) in two segments as part of the guaranteed time observation program .",
    "the configuration included hetg with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - s ) .",
    "acis has moderate spectral resolution which allows order sorting of the grating spectrum .",
    "the two e0102 - 72 observations had slightly different roll angles and aim points . most of the analysis below was therefore restricted to a single observation ( obsid 120 ) .",

    "a portion of the dispersed high resolution x - ray spectrum of e0102 - 72 ( a thousand year old supernova remnant in the small magellanic cloud ) is shown in figure  1 .",
    "the chandra observation was taken using the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) which employs the high energy gratings in conjunction with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) .",
    "the hetgs separates the x - rays into their distinct x - ray emission lines , forming separate images of the remnant with the x - ray light of each line .",
    "the dispersed spectrum shows x - ray lines of highly ionized oxygen , neon , magnesium and silicon .",
    "several of the dispersed ` ring ' images differ from the zeroth order image .",
    "there are differences in radii , likely caused by the changing ionization state , that suggest the passage of the supernova ejecta through the reverse shock .",
    "note also the distorted shape of the nex ly  @xmath1 line relative to the zeroth order .",
    "this is due to doppler shifts associated with high velocity material .",
    "both of these features are discussed in detail below .",
    "a side - by - side comparison of the dispersed ovii resonance line with the oviii ly  @xmath1 line is given in figure  2 .",
    "ovii is helium - like oxygen , with two electrons remaining , whereas oviii is hydrogen - like .",
    "the ring diameter of the oviii line is obviously larger than that of the ovii line .",
    "the ring diameters for all the bright x - ray lines were measured by tracing the distribution in the cross - dispersion direction , as illustrated in the right panel of figure  2 , which shows the cross - dispersion histograms for the oviii ly  @xmath1 and ovii resonance lines .",
    "each histogram begins below the bottom edge of the ring and ends above the top edge . clearly , the diameters of the two rings differ markedly , with the helium - like ovii being narrower .",
    "the measured diameters for the bright lines are shown in the figure  3 .",
    "it is apparent that * all of the hydrogen - like lines * ( connected by the top curve ) * lie outside their corresponding helium - like lines * ( connected by the bottom curve ) . as each element is considered on an individual basis , the hydrogen - like emitting region lies outward of the helium - like emitting region , suggesting a mechanism which is independent of spatial separation of the elements .",
    "this mechanism is discussed in the next section .",
    "consider the evolution of an ionizing plasma toward equilibrium . after the passage of a shock , at a fixed electron temperature @xmath2 and electron density @xmath3",
    ", a helium - like ionization state is created earlier than a hydrogen - like state .",
    "this is illustrated in the right panel of figure  3 , where a neon plasma has been heated to electron temperature @xmath2=10@xmath4 by the passage of a shock .",
    "the emissivity of a line of helium - like neon is seen to peak at an earlier ionization age than hydrogen - like neon ( where the ionization age @xmath5 is defined as the product of electron density ne@xmath6 and time since passage of the shock , i.e. , @xmath5=n@xmath6 t ) .",
    "the hydrogen - like outer region is therefore a more ` evolved ' plasma than the helium - like inner region .",
    "this suggests the action of a shock moving _ inward _ relative to the ejecta - the ` reverse shock'- which is the standard model for the mechanism which heats snr ejecta to x - ray temperatures .",
    "this is illustrated in the left panel of figure  4 .",
    "the results of applying a very simple model are shown in the right panel of figure  4 .",
    "the model assumes that the elements are uniformly mixed , and that there is a single electron temperature .",
    "we make these assumptions to examine the proposition that the ring diameter corresponds to ionization age , where we have estimated that age by finding the peak emissivity ( raymond & smith 1977 ; hughes & helfand 1985 ) for each bright x - ray line assuming a fixed t@xmath6 of about 1  kev or log t@xmath6=10@xmath4 ( as suggested by our global nei analysis ) .",
    "although any workable model must consider many parameters , the monotonic behavior of the data strongly suggests that these arcsec differences in ring diameter are attributable to the ionization structure resulting from the reverse shock .",
    "as seen in figure  5 , distortion is evident when dispersed images of nex  ly  @xmath1 are compared with the zeroth order ( m=0 ) .",
    "( the zeroth order has been filtered to include only events around the 1022  ev energy of nex  ly  @xmath1 ) .",
    "the leftmost panel shows the m=-1 ring , the middle panel is the zeroth order , and the right panel is the m=+1 ring .",
    "doppler red shifts to longer wavelengths are indicated by distortions outward , away from zero order , and blue shifts are indicated by distortions of the ring _ toward _ the zeroth order at the center .",
    "thus , the upper left sector of the remnant appears to have a red shift as seen by examining the m=-1 order ring , whereas the right half of the ring is broadened in the + 1 order , indicating _ both _ red and blue shifts for the right half of the remnant .",
    "ks tests support this qualitative interpretation , indicating that , to high confidence , the dispersion - direction profiles of the dispersed and undispersed images are _ different _ , while the cross - dispersion profiles are _ the same_.    the results of quantitative analysis are schematically illustrated in figure  6 , where white arrows pointing toward the left indicate blue shifts , and red arrows pointing toward the right indicate red shifts .",
    "the lengths and locations of the arrows are used to indicate the relative velocities and approximate locations associated with the doppler shifts .",
    "typical red and blue - shifts indicate velocities on the order of 1000  km / s ( houck et al .",
    "2000 ) , comparable to those of optical filaments .",
    "the _ chandra _ high - resolution x - ray spectrum of e0102 - 72 obtained with the hetgs reveals images of the supernova remnant in the light of individual lines of o , ne , mg and si . radial variations among different ionization stages are seen on an arcsecond spatial scale , consistent with an evolving ionization structure due to the passage of the ejecta through the reverse shock .",
    "doppler shifts of @xmath01000  km / sec ( comparable to the velocities of optical filaments ) have been detected at various locations along the remnant .",
    "this velocity information is being applied toward a model of the morphology and motion of the x - ray emitting material .",
    "we thank glenn allen , norbert schulz , tom pannuti and sara - anne taylor for helpful discussions .",
    "we are grateful to the cxc group at mit for their assistance in analysis of the data .",
    "this work was prepared under nasa contract nas8 - 38249 and sao sv1 - 61010 ."
