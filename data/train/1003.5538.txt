    "an issue central to modeling local field potentials is whether the extracellular space around neurons can be considered as a resistive medium .",
    "a resistive medium is equivalent to replacing the medium by a simple resistance , which considerably simplifies the computation of local field potentials , as the equations to calculate extracellular fields are very simple and based on coulomb s law ( rall and shepherd , 1968 ; nunez and srinivasan , 2005 ) .",
    "forward models of the eeg and inverse solution / source localization methods also assume that the medium is resistive ( sarvas , 1987 ; wolters and de munck , 2007 ; ramirez , 2008 ) .",
    "however , if the medium is non - resistive , the equations governing the extracellular potential can be considerably more complex because the quasi - static approximation of maxwell equations can not be made ( bdard et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "experimental characterizations of extracellular resistivity are contradictory . some experiments reported that the conductivity is strongly frequency dependent , and thus that the medium is non - resistive ( ranck , 1963 ; gabriel et al .",
    ", 1996a , 1996b , 1996c ) .",
    "other experiments reported that the medium was essentially resistive ( logothetis et al .",
    ", 2007 ) . however , both types of measurements used current intensities far larger than physiological currents , which can mask the filtering properties of the tissue by preventing phenomena such as ionic diffusion ( bdard and destexhe , 2009 ) . unfortunately , the issue is still open because there exists no measurements to date using ( weak ) current intensities that would be more compatible with biological current sources .    in the present paper ,",
    "we propose an indirect method to estimate if extracellular space can be considered as a purely resistive medium .",
    "we start from maxwell equations and show that if the medium was resistive , the frequency - scaling of electroencephalogram ( eeg ) and magnetoencephalogram ( meg ) recordings should be the same .",
    "we then test this scaling on simultaneous eeg and meg measurements in humans .",
    "we recorded the electromagnetic field of the brain during quiet wakefulness ( with alpha rhythm occasionally present ) from four healthy adults ( 4 males ages 20 - 35 ) .",
    "participants had no neurological problems including sleep disorders , epilepsy , or substance dependence , were taking no medications and did not consume caffeine or alcohol on the day of the recording .",
    "we used a whole - head meg scanner ( neuromag elekta ) within a magnetically shielded room ( imedco , hagendorf , switzerland ) and recorded simultaneously with 60 channels of eeg and 306 meg channels ( nenonen et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "meg squid ( super conducting quantum interference device ) sensors are arranged as triplets at 102 locations ; each location contains one `` magnetometer '' and two orthogonal planar `` gradiometers '' ( grad1 , grad2 ) . unless otherwise noted , meg will be used here to refer to the magnetometer recordings .",
    "locations of the eeg electrodes on the scalp of individual subjects were recorded using a 3d digitizer ( polhemus fasttrack ) .",
    "hpi ( head position index ) coils were used to measure the spatial relationship between the head and scanner .",
    "electrode arrangements were constructed from the projection of 3d position of electrodes to a 2d plane in order to map the frequency scaling exponent in a topographical manner .",
    "all eeg recordings were monopolar with a common reference .",
    "sampling rate was 1000 hz .",
    "for all subjects , four types of consecutive recordings were obtained , in the following order : ( 1 ) empty - room recording ; ( 2 ) awake `` idle '' recording where subjects were asked to stay comfortable , without movements in the scanner , and not to focus on anything specific ; ( 3 ) a visual task ; ( 4 ) sleep recordings .",
    "all idle recordings used here were made in awake subjects with eyes open , where the eeg was desynchronized .",
    "a few minutes of such idle time was recorded in the scanner . for each subject , 3 awake segments with duration of 60 seconds were selected from the idle recordings ( see example signals in fig .  [ eegmeg ] ) .    as electrocardiogram ( ecg ) noise often contaminates meg recordings , independent component analysis ( ica ) algorithm",
    "was used to remove such contamination ; either infomax ( bell and sejnowski , 1995 ) or the `` jade algorithm '' from the eeglab toolbox ( delorme and makeig , 2004 ) was used to achieve proper decontamination . in all recordings",
    ", the ecg component stood out very robustly . in order not to impose any change in the frequency content of the signal , we did not use the ica to filter the data on any prominent independent oscillatory component and",
    "it was solely used to decontaminate the ecg noise .",
    "we verified that the removal of ecg did not change the scaling exponent ( not shown ) .    in each recording session , just prior to brain recordings , we recorded a few minutes of the electromagnetic field present within the dewar in the magnetic shielded room .",
    "similar to wake epochs , 3 segments of 60 seconds duration were selected for each of the four recordings .",
    "this will be referred to `` empty room '' recordings and will be used in noise correction of the awake recordings .    in each subject , the power spectral density ( psd ) was calculated by first computing the fast fourier transform ( fft ) of 3 awake epochs , then averaging their respective psds ( square modulus of the fft ) .",
    "this averaged psd was computed for all eeg and meg channels in order to reduce the effects of spurious peaks due to random fluctuations .",
    "the same procedure was also followed for empty - room signals .      because the environmental and instrumental sources of noise are potentially high in meg recordings , we took advantage of the availability of empty - room recordings to correct for the presence of noise in the signal .",
    "we used five different methods for noise correction , based on different assumptions about the nature of the noise .",
    "we describe below these different correction methods , while all the details are given in _",
    "supplementary methods_.    a first procedure for noise correction , exponent subtraction ( es ) , assumes that the noise is intrinsic to the squid sensors .",
    "this is justified by the fact that the frequency scaling of some of the channels is identical to that of the corresponding empty - room recording ( see results ) .",
    "in such a case , the scaling is assumed to entirely result from the `` filtering '' of the sensor , and thus the correction amounts to subtract the scaling exponents .",
    "a second class of noise subtraction methods assume that the noise is of ambient nature and is uncorrelated with the signal .",
    "this chatacteristics , warrants the use of spectral subtraction ( where one subtracts the psd of the empty - room from that of the meg recordings ) , prior to the calculation of the scaling exponent .",
    "the simplest form of spectral subtraction , linear multiband spectral subtraction ( lmss ) , treats the sensors individually and does not use any spatial / frequency - based statistics in its methodology ( boll et al . , 1979 ) .",
    "an improved version , nonlinear multiband spectral subtraction ( nmss ) , takes into account the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and its spatial and frequency characteristics ( kamath and loizou , 2002 ; loizou , 2007 ) . a third type , wiener filtering ( wf ) , uses a similar approach as the latter , but obtain an estimate of the noiseless signal from that of the noisy measurement through minimizing the mean square error ( mse ) between the desired and the measured signal ( lim et al . , 1979 ;",
    "abd el - fattah et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "a third type of noise subtraction , partial least squares ( pls ) regression , combines principal component analysis ( pca ) methods with multiple linear regression ( abdi , 2010 ; garthwaite , 1994 ) .",
    "this methods finds the spectral patterns that are common in the meg and the empty - room noise , and removes these patterns from the psd .",
    "the method to estimate the frequency scaling exponent was composed of steps : first , applying a spline to obtain a smooth fft without losing the resolution ( as can happen by using other spectral estimation methods ) ; second , using a simple polynomial fit to obtain the scaling exponent . to improve the slope estimation , we approximated the psd data points using a spline , which is a series of piecewise polynomials with smooth transitions and where the break points ( `` knots '' ) are specified .",
    "we used the so - called `` b - spline '' ( see details in de boor , 2001 ) .",
    "the knots were first defined as linearly related to logarithm of the frequency , which naturally gives more resolution to low frequencies , to which our theory applies .",
    "next , in each frequency window ( between consecutive knots ) , we find the closest psd value to the mean psd of that window .",
    "then we use the corresponding frequency as the optimized knot in that frequency range , leading the final values of the knots .",
    "the resulting knots stay close to the initial distribution of frequency knots but are modified based on each sensor s psd data to provide the optimal knot points for that given sensor ( fig .",
    "[ knots]a ) .",
    "we also use additional knots at the outer edges of the signal to avoid boundary effects ( eilers and marx , 1996 ) .",
    "the applied method provides a reliable and automated approach that uses our enforced initial frequency segments with a high emphasis in low frequency and it optimizes itself based on the data . after obtaining a smooth b - spline curve ,",
    "a simple 1st degree polynomial fit was used to estimate the slope of the curve between 0.1 - 10 hz ( the fit was limited to this frequency band in order to avoid the possible effects of the visible peak at 10  hz on the estimated exponent).using this method provides a reliable and robust estimate of the slope of the psd in logarithmic scale , as shown in fig .",
    "[ knots]b . for more details on the issue of automatic non - parametric fitting , and the rationale behind combining the polynomial with spline basis functions ,",
    "we refer the reader to magee , 1998 as well as royston & altman , 1994 and katkovnik et al , 2006 .",
    "this procedure was realized on all channels automatically ( 102 channels for meg , 60 channels for eeg , for each patient ) .",
    "every single fit was further visually confirmed . in the case of meg ,",
    "noise correction is essential to validate the results .",
    "for doing so , we used different methods ( as described above ) to reduce the noise .",
    "next , all the mentioned steps of frequency scaling exponents were carried out on the corrected psd .",
    "results are shown in fig .",

    "three rois were selected for statistical comparisons of the topographic plots . as shown in figure  [ topo ] ( panel f ) , fr ( frontal )",
    "roi refers to the frontal ellipsoid , vx ( vertex ) roi refers to the central disk located on vertex and pt ( parietotemporal ) refers to the horseshoe roi .",
    "we start from first principles ( maxwell equations ) and derive equations to describe eeg and meg signals .",
    "note that the formalism we present here is different than the one usually given ( as in plonsey , 1969 ; gulrajani , 1998 ) , because the linking equations are here considered in their most general expression ( convolution integrals ) , in the case of a linear medium ( see eq .",
    "77.4 in landau and lifchitz , 1984 ) .",
    "this generality is essential for the problem we treat here , because our aim is to compare eeg and meg signals with the predictions from the theory , and thus the theory must be as general as possible .",
    "maxwell equations can be written as @xmath3    if we suppose that the brain is linear in the electromagnetic sense ( which is most likely ) , then we have the two following linking equations .",
    "the first equation links the electric displacement with the electric field :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is a symmetric second - order tensor .    a second equation links magnetic induction and the magnetic field : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a symmetric second - order tensor .    if we neglect non - resistive effects such as diffusion ( bdard and destexhe , 2009 ) , as well as any other nonlinear effects with the magnitude of electric field @xmath8 .",
    "such variations could appear due to ephaptic ( electric - field ) interactions for example .",
    "in addition , any type of linear reactivity of the medium to the electric field or magnetic induction can lead to frequency - dependent electric parameters @xmath9 ( for a detailed discussion of such effects , see bdard and destexhe , 2009 ) . ]",
    ", then we can assume that the medium is linear .",
    "in this case , we can write : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a symmetric second - order tensor.[liaisonj ] ) are often algebraic and independent of time ( for example , see eqs .",
    "5.2 - 6 , 5.2 - 7 and 5.2 - 8 in gulrajani , 1998 ) .",
    "the present formulation is more general , more in the line of landau and lifchitz ( 1984 ) . ]",
    "because the effect of electric induction ( faraday s law ) is negligible , we can write : @xmath12 this system is much simpler compared to above , because electric field and magnetic induction are decoupled .    by taking the fourier transform of maxwell equations ( eqs .",
    "[ max ] ) and of the linking equations ( eqs .",
    "[ liaisond],[liaisonb],[liaisonj ] ) , we obtain : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 where the relation @xmath16 in eq .",
    "[ liaisonfourier ] is the current density produced    by the ( primary ) current sources in the extracellular medium .",
    "note that in this formulation , the electromagnetic parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 depend on frequency .",
    "this generalization is essential if we want the formalism to be valid for media that are linear but non - resistive , which can expressed with frequency - dependent electric parameters .",
    "it is also consistent with the kramers - kronig relations ( see landau and lifchitz , 1984 ; foster and schwan , 1989 ) .",
    "@xmath20 is the current density of these sources in fourier frequency space .",
    "this current density is composed of the axial current in dendrites and axons , as well as the transmembrane current .    of course , this expression is such that at any given point , there is only one of these two terms which is non - zero .",
    "this is a way of preserving the linearity of maxwell equations .",
    "such a procedure is legitimate because the sources are not affected by the field they produce .      from eq .",

    "we will call this expression ( eq .",
    "[ fondement1 ] ) the `` first fundamental equation '' of the problem .      from the mathematical identity @xmath28",
    "it is clear that this is sufficient to know the divergence and the curl of a field @xmath29 , because the solution of @xmath30 is unique with adequate boundary conditions .    as in the case of magnetic induction ,",
    "the divergence is necessarily zero , it is sufficient to give an explicit expression of the curl as a function of the sources .    supposing that @xmath31 is a scalar ( tensor where all directions are eigenvectors ) , and taking the curl of eq .",
    "[ maxfourier ] ( d ) , multiplied by the inverse of @xmath32 , we obtain the following equality : @xmath33 because @xmath34 .",
    "this expression ( eq .",
    "[ fondement2 ] ) will be named the `` second fundamental equation '' .",
    "we consider the following boundary conditions :    1 - on the skull , we assume that @xmath35 is differentiable in space , which is equivalent to assume that the electric field is finite .    2 - on the skull , we assume that @xmath36 is also continuous , which is equivalent to assume that the flow of current is continuous .",
    "thus , we are interested in solutions where the electric field is continuous .    3 - because the current is zero outside of the head , the current perpendicular to the surface of cortex",
    "must be zero as well .",
    "thus , the projection of the current on the vector @xmath37 normal to the skull s surface , must also be zero .",
    "@xmath38 the latter expression can be proven by calculating the total current and apply the divergence theorem ( not shown ) .",
    "the `` second fundamental equation '' above implies inverting @xmath32 , which is not possible in general , because it would require prior knowledge of both conductivity and permittivity in each point outside of the sources .",
    "if the medium is purely resistive ( @xmath39 where @xmath40 is independent of space and frequency ) , one can evaluate the electric field first , and next integrate @xmath41 using the quasi - static approximation ( ampre - maxwell s law ) . because for low frequencies , we have necessarily @xmath42 , we obtain @xmath43 which is also known as ampre s law in fourier space .",
    "thus , for low frequencies , one can skip the second fundamental equation .",
    "note that in case this quasi - static approximation can not be made ( such as for high frequencies ) , then one needs to solve the full system using both fundamental equations . such high frequencies are , however , well beyond the physiological range , so for eeg and meg signals , the quasi - static approximation holds if the extracellular medium is resistive , or more generally if the medium satisfies @xmath44 ( see eqs .",
    "[ ff ] and [ maxfourier ] ) .    according to the quasi - static approximation , and using the linking equation between current density and the electric field ( eq .",
    "[ liaisonfourier ] ) , we can write : @xmath45    because the divergence of magnetic induction is zero , we have from eq .",
    "[ identite ] : @xmath46    this equation can be easily integrated using poisson integral ( `` poisson equation '' for each component in cartesian coordinates ) in fourier space , this integral is given by the following expression @xmath47      if the medium is purely resistive ( `` ohmic '' ) , then @xmath40 does not depend on the spatial position ( see bedard et al . , 2004 ; bedard and destexhe , 2009 ) nor on frequency , so that the solution for the magnetic induction is given by : @xmath48 and does not depend on the nature of the medium .    for the electric potential , from eq .",
    "[ fondement1 ] , we obtain the solution : @xmath49    thus , when the two source terms @xmath50 and @xmath51 are white noise , the magnetic induction and electric field must have the same frequency dependence .",
    "moreover , because the spatial dimensions of the sources are very small ( see appendices ) , we can suppose that the current density @xmath52 is given by a function of the form : @xmath53 such that @xmath54 and @xmath55 have the same frequency dependence for low frequencies .",
    "[ assump ] constitutes the main assumption of this formalism .    in appendix",
    "a , we provide a more detailed justification of this assumption , based on the differential expressions of the electric field and magnetic induction in a dendritic cable .",
    "note that this assumption is most likely valid for states with low correlation such as desynchronized - eeg states or high - conductance states , and for low - frequencies , as we analyze here ( see details in the appendices ) .",
    "thus , the main prediction of this formalism is that if the extracellular medium is resistive , then the psd of the magnetic induction and of the electric potential must have the same frequency dependence . in the next section",

    "although the subjects had eyes open , a low - amplitude alpha rhythm was occasionally present ( as visible in fig .

    ". then we report the scaling exponents for 0.1 - 10  hz frequency bands and their differences in eeg and meg recordings .      because of the large number of signals in the eeg and meg recordings",
    ", we used an automatic non - parametric procedure to estimate the frequency scaling ( see methods ) .",
    "we used a b - spline approximation by interpolation with boundary conditions to find a curve which best represents the data(see methods ) .",
    "a high density of knots was given to the low - frequency band ( 0.1 - 10  hz ) , to have an accurate representation of the psd in this band , and calculate the frequency scaling .",
    "an example of optimized knots to an individual sensor is shown in figure  [ knots]a ; note that this distribution of knots is specific to this particular sensor .",
    "the resulting b - spline curves were used to estimate the frequency scaling exponent using a 1st degree polynomial fit .",
    "figure  [ knots]b shows the result of the b - spline analysis with optimized knots ( in green ) capturing the essence of the data better than the usual approximation of the slope using polynomials ( in red ) .",

    "figure  [ psd ] shows the results of the b - spline curve fits to the log - log psd vs frequency for all sensors of all subjects . in this figure , and only for the ease of visual comparison , these curves were normalized to the value of the log(psd ) of the highest frequency .",
    "as can be appreciated , all meg sensors ( in red ) show a different slope than that of the eeg sensors ( in blue ) .",
    "the frequency scaling exponent of the eeg is close to 1 ( @xmath1 scaling ) , while meg seems to scale differently .",
    "thus , this representation already shows clear differences of scaling between eeg and meg signals .",
    "however , meg signals may be affected by ambient or instrumental noise . to check for this ,",
    "we have analyzed the empty - room signals using the same representation and techniques as for meg , amd the results are represented in fig .",
    "[ psd ] ( insets ) .",
    "empty - room recordings always scale very closely to the meg signal , and thus the scaling observed in meg may be due in part to environmental noise or noise intrinsic to the detectors .",
    "this emphasizes that it is essential to use empty - room recordings made during the same experiment to correct the frequency scaling exponent of meg recordings .    to correct for this bias ,",
    "we have used five different procedures ( see methods ) .",
    "the first class of procedure ( es ) considers that the scaling of the meg is entirely due to filtering by the sensors , which would explain the similar scaling between meg and empty - room recordings . in this case , however , nearly all the scaling would be abolished , and the corrected meg signal would be similar to white noise ( scaling exponent close to zero ) . because the similar scaling may be coincidental , we have used two other classes of noise correction procedures to comply with different assumptions about the nature of the noise . the second class ,",
    "is composed of spectral subtraction ( lmss and nmss ) or wiener filtering ( see methods ) .",
    "these methods are well - established in other fields such as acoustics .",

    "we applied the above methods to all channels and represented the scaling exponents in topographic plots in fig .",
    "this figure portrays that both meg and eeg do not show a homogenous pattern of the scaling exponent , confirming the differences of scaling seen in fig .",
    "the eeg ( figure  [ topo]a ) shows that areas in the midline have values closer to 1 , while those at the margin can deviate from @xmath1 scaling .",
    "meg on the other hand shows higher values of the exponent in the frontal area and a horseshoe pattern of low value exponents in parietotemporal regions ( figure  [ topo]b ) . as anticipated above , empty - room recordings scale more or less uniformly with values close to @xmath1 ( figure  [ topo]c ) , thus necessitating the correction for this phenomena to estimate the correct meg frequency scaling exponent .",
    "different methods for noise reduction are shown in figure  [ topo ] : spectral subtraction methods , such as lmss ( figure  [ topo]d ) , nmss ( figure  [ topo]e ) , wf enhancement ( figure  [ topo]f ) .",
    "these corrections preserve the pattern seen in figure  [ topo]b , but tend to increase the difference with eeg scaling : one method ( lmss ) yields minimal correction while the other two ( nmss and wf ) use band - specific snr information in order to cancel the effects of background colored - noise ( see suppl .",

    "of the spectral subtraction methods , nmss achieves a higher degree of correction in comparison with lmss ( see figure  [ topo]c , figure  [ topo]d as well as suppl .",
    "s3 ) . because nmss takes into account the effects of the background colored - noise ( suppl .",
    "s2 ) , it is certainly more relevant to the type of signals analyzed here .",
    "the results of nmss and wf are almost identical and confirm one another ( see figure  [ topo]e , as well as suppl .  fig .",
    "therefore , of this family of noise correction , only nmss is portrayed here . of the methods dealing with different assumptions about the nature of the noise ,",
    "the `` exponent subtraction '' almost abolishes the frequency scaling ( also see in figure  [ topo]h , as well as suppl .",

    "these similarities , in terms of regional overall values and distribution curve , are further enhanced after nmss correction .",

    "<S> the resistive or non - resistive nature of the extracellular space in the brain is still debated , and is an important issue for correctly modeling extracellular potentials . here , we first show theoretically that if the medium is resistive , the frequency scaling should be the same for electroencephalogram ( eeg ) and magnetoencephalogram ( meg ) signals at low frequencies ( @xmath010  hz ) . to test this prediction </S>",
    "<S> , we analyzed the spectrum of simultaneous eeg and meg measurements in four human subjects . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency scaling of eeg displays coherent variations across the brain , in general between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and tends to be smaller in parietal / temporal regions . in a given region , although the variability of the frequency scaling exponent was higher for meg compared to eeg , both signals consistently scale with a different exponent . in some cases , </S>",
    "<S> the scaling was similar , but only when the signal - to - noise ratio of the meg was low . </S>",
    "<S> several methods of noise correction for environmental and instrumental noise were tested , and they all increased the difference between eeg and meg scaling . in conclusion , there is a significant difference in frequency scaling between eeg and meg , which can be explained if the extracellular medium ( including other layers such as dura matter and skull ) is globally non - resistive .    </S>",
