    "following the discovery in 1961 of @xmath19 meson in @xmath20 reactions  @xcite , the measurements of forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath21 suggested the existence of a rho - like resonance in the @xmath1-wave , later referred to as @xmath22 scalar meson  @xcite .",
    "it was expected that @xmath22 would show up prominently in @xmath23 production where @xmath5 does not contribute .",
    "the measurements of this reaction at cern in 1972 found no evidence for a rho - like @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in 1973 , pennington and protopopescu used analyticity and unitarity constraints on partial wave amplitudes in @xmath24 scattering ( roy equations ) to show that a narrow @xmath22 resonance can not contribute to @xmath25 scattering  @xcite . from these facts",
    "it was concluded that @xmath22 does not exist in @xmath0 and in 1974 particle data group dropped this state from its listings .    in 1978",

    "clear evidence for @xmath22 emerged from later and more precise amplitude analyses of both reactions  @xcite .",

    "the data revealed large differences in the @xmath1-wave intensities in @xmath33 and @xmath34 production .",
    "there was no evidence for a rho - like @xmath22 resonance in the @xmath34 @xmath1-wave .",
    "the bnl data presented anew the puzzle of the @xmath22 resonance . the cern and bnl data are both high quality data that can not be used to exclude one another .",
    "we must accept that they are both correct and that the apparent contradictions between them are telling us something new and important .",
    "the puzzle of @xmath22 resonance has become a unique opportunity to learn new physics .",
    "the first hints on the solution of the puzzle emerged from the amplitude analysis of cern measurements of @xmath0 in ref .",
    "this study extended the dipion mass range of 600 - 900 mev of previous analyses  @xcite to 580 - 1080 mev to include the @xmath7 resonance .",
    "the @xmath1-wave transversity ampltudes @xmath8 with target nucleon trasversity @xmath35 were fitted using a parametrization with breit - wigner amplitudes for both resonances and complex backgoudnds .",
    "the best fit to all moduli of @xmath1-wave transversity amplitudes gives @xmath36 mev and @xmath37 mev .",
    "these values are very close to resonance parameters of @xmath5 with @xmath38 mev and @xmath39 mev .",
    "both solutions for the @xmath2-wave amplitude with zero dipion helicity @xmath6 showed an unexpected dip at @xmath40 980 mev , the mass of @xmath7 resonance .    in 2001 , gale and collaborators investigated @xmath41 mixing in lepton pair production at rhic arising from the violation of lorentz symmetry by vacuum but conserved by the interaction lagrangian , and found large measurable effects  @xcite .",
    "their work suggested that the dip in @xmath6 arises from @xmath3 mixing in the @xmath2-wave .",
    "similar mixing in the @xmath1-wave then allows to identify @xmath22 with @xmath5 which immediately explains why no @xmath22 was ever found in @xmath23 production .",
    "the @xmath3 mixing implies an apparent violation of rotational and lorentz symmetry which appeared to be supported by the observation of large differences in @xmath5 widths in the moduli of @xmath2-wave amplitues @xmath16 and @xmath17 with transverse dipion helicities .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we used the results of the fits to the transversity amplitudes to calculate @xmath1-wave helicity non - flip and flip amplitudes @xmath42 and @xmath43 assuming the residues of @xmath22 were real and positive in both transversity amplitudes and there was no additional relative phase apart from the fits .",
    "the results suggested that @xmath22 dominates @xmath42 while it is suppressed in @xmath43 , and therefore that it dominates in @xmath44 and is suppressed in @xmath24 scattering .",
    "however , the results for @xmath43 disagreed with established @xmath25 scattering amplitudes . in over 100 later fits with different input values of complex residues of @xmath22 and other fitting parameters we obtained mostly convergent fits .",
    "they all had the same @xmath45 and values of resonance parameters of @xmath22 and @xmath7 identical to the values from our original fits . however , the corresponding aplitudes @xmath42 and @xmath43 were widely different with many of them unphysical solutions .",
    "we must conclude that the presence of a rho - like resonance in @xmath1-wave transversity amplitudes is not related to @xmath44 or @xmath24 scattering .",
    "it stands on its own and lends support to the hypothesis of @xmath3 mixing .    in this work we present our results of a high resolution amplitude analysis of cern data on polarized target ( analysis i ) and of a new model independent amplitude analysis of cern data on unpolarized target ( analysis ii ) .",
    "we trace the presence of @xmath5 in the @xmath1-wave transversity amplitudes in both analyses to the data component @xmath46 in the equation @xmath47 .",
    "the data @xmath46 have a large @xmath5 peak that is not balanced out by @xmath5 peak in the @xmath2-wave amplitude @xmath48 .",
    "the relative phases between @xmath1-wave amplitudes and @xmath2-wave amplitudes @xmath9 and @xmath11 are near @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively in both analyses .",
    "since the @xmath2-wave amplitudes have @xmath5 breit - wigner phase , the @xmath1-wave amplitudes must have nearly the same resonant phase .",
    "next we outline a model independent method to determine the @xmath1- and @xmath2-wave helicity amplitudes from the knowledge of transversity amplitudes and present new results on helicity amplitudes @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "the four solutions for the single flip amplitude @xmath13 show a clear @xmath5 peak and the phase of @xmath43 is again nearly equal to the phase of @xmath2-wave amplitude @xmath54 .",
    "there is a remarkable similarity and concordance between the analyses i , ii and the helicity amplitudes .",
    "finally we show that the large differences in the widths of @xmath16 and @xmath17 amplitudes arise from the interference of amplitudes of opposite dipion helicities @xmath55 , and that the width of @xmath5 resonance does not depend on its helicity in both analyses i and ii . this suggests that the production process conserves rotational / lorentz symmetry .",
    "this means that the mechanism for the @xmath56 mixing and the production mechanism have different dynamical origins .",
    "while there is no reason to assume that the production mechanism is governed by anything other than the @xmath1-matrix , the @xmath3 mixing must originate in a new spin mixing interaction .",
    "while the production mechanism conserves lorentz symmetry , the spin mixing mechanism spontaneously breaks this symmetry in the measured amplitudes that combine both mechanisms .",
    "we address these issues in two related papers  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ii .",
    "we define the @xmath1-and @xmath2-wave subsystem and the reduced transversity amplitudes used in all our analyses . in sections iii . and",

    "we use analyses i and ii to demonstrate the helicity independence of the @xmath5 width and thus lorentz symmetry of the production mechanism .",
    "the paper closes with our conclusions and outlook in section viii . in the appendix",
    "we show that the measurements of @xmath57 and @xmath58 determine uniquely the signs of relative phases in the analyses i and ii .",
