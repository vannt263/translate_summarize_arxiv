    "in the past few months , the use of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite to study energy loss in finite - temperature strongly - coupled gauge theories has attracted significant attention , partly because it is hoped that this line of research could eventually make contact with experimental data from rhic @xcite and alice @xcite .    the drag force experienced by a heavy quark that moves through a thermal @xmath0 super - yang - mills ( sym ) plasma was determined in @xcite , using its dual description as a string that moves on an ads - schwarzschild background .",
    "the same information was obtained independently in @xcite through a different method , based on an analysis of small string fluctuations ( a similar calculation was performed in @xcite ) .",
    "generalizations of the first calculation may be found in @xcite .",
    "a comparison with the corresponding weakly - coupled result was carried out in @xcite .",
    "the connection with magnetic confinement was explored in @xcite .",
    "the directionality of the coherent wake left by the moving quark on the gluonic fields was studied in @xcite , using the methods of @xcite .",
    "an independent approach has aimed at determining the jet - quenching parameter @xmath3 that in phenomenological models of energy loss through medium - induced radiation is meant to codify the average squared transverse momentum transferred to the quark by the medium ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "based on the fact that certain approximate calculations in these models relate @xmath3 to a lightlike wilson loop in the adjoint representation ( see @xcite and references therein ) , the authors of @xcite suggested that this wilson loop could be taken to provide a non - perturbative definition of the jet - quenching parameter . using the simple large-@xmath4 relation between adjoint and fundamental loops , and the ads / cft recipe for the latter @xcite , they then proceeded to compute this parameter for @xmath0 sym .",
    "their calculation has been generalized in various directions in @xcite .",
    "previous related work may be found in @xcite .",
    "just like the drag force determination in @xcite , the calculation of @xmath3 in @xcite focuses on a string that moves on an ads - schwarzschild background .",
    "the difference is that the string considered in @xcite has a single endpoint on the boundary , representing the moving external quark , whereas the string studied in @xcite has both of its endpoints on the boundary , representing an external quark - antiquark pair that traces out the required lightlike wilson loop .    in this paper",
    "we perform a natural generalization of the above calculations , using the ads / cft correspondence to determine the energy of a quark - antiquark pair that moves with velocity @xmath5 through a strongly - coupled thermal @xmath0 sym plasma .",
    "this problem had been previously studied in the case @xmath6 , where the pair is static with respect to the plasma .",
    "as expected , the quark - antiquark potential was found to be insensitive to the plasma at small distances , and to display screening behavior beyond a certain length @xcite . analyzing the manner in which these features are modified by the motion of the pair through",
    "the plasma is an interesting question in its own right , both from the theoretical and the phenomenological perspectives .",
    "our analysis is additionally motivated by the current discussion on energy loss : the moving quark - antiquark pair serves as a color - neutral probe of the plasma that stands in useful contrast with the solitary quark considered in @xcite , and moreover , in the @xmath7 limit it would be expected to make contact with the system studied in @xcite .",
    "our presentation is organized as follows . in section  [ stringsec ]",
    "we briefly review the salient points of the drag force calculation of @xcite , and then set up and study the analogous problem for the string on ads - schwarzschild that has both of its endpoints on the boundary , satisfying the boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) .",
    "below this equation and again after ( [ rminfull ] ) we find that this string feels no drag force , discuss the physical reasons for this result and point out that there exist configurations with the same boundary conditions but different initial conditions where the string _ does _ experience a drag force .",
    "although framed in the specific context of the background dual to @xmath0 sym , the essence of our arguments is more general and applies to other backgrounds . at the end of section  [ stringsec ] we derive the basic equations ( [ yprime])-([ebar ] ) that determine the shape and energy of the string in the background at hand .",
    "we work first in the frame where the plasma is at rest , and discuss a subtlety in defining the energy ( and momentum ) of the disconnected strings dual to an unbound quark and antiquark .",
    "we then lorentz - transform to the frame where the @xmath8 pair is at rest , where the energy can be defined in the standard straightforward manner .",
    "we note that even though the string is by definition static in this frame , it still carries momentum , which as we explain below ( [ energia2 ] ) codifies information about the momentum density of the gluonic field configuration set up by the quarks in the dual gauge theory .",
    "because of this non - vanishing momentum , the energy @xmath9 in the plasma rest frame is not simply proportional to the energy @xmath10 in the pair rest frame .",
    "the relation between the two is given in ( [ energias ] ) .",
    "section  [ qqbarsec ] contains our main results , in sym language .",
    "we open with a discussion on the gauge - theoretic interpretation for the result that the quark - antiquark pair feels no drag force as it ploughs through the @xmath0 sym plasma .",
    "after that we carry out the numerical integrations needed to determine the energy of the @xmath8 pair as a function of the separation @xmath11 and velocity @xmath5 .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ elow],[ehigh ] .",
    "the energy reduces to the expected coulombic behavior ( [ lchica ] ) for small separations , and then rises above this behavior due to the effects of the plasma , up to a screening length @xmath12 beyond which the quark and antiquark become unbound .",
    "the velocity - dependence of this screening length is shown in fig .",
    "[ lv ] ; we find it to be well - approximated by ( [ lstar ] ) . for velocities",
    "@xmath13 we find a gap in energy between the bound and unbound @xmath8 configurations , whose physical significance remains unclear to us .    in the closing pages of section  [ qqbarsec ]",
    "we discuss at length the relation between the @xmath7 limit of our results and the lightlike wilson loop proposed in @xcite as a definition of the jet - quenching parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the main lesson is that the ads / cft result of @xcite can not be obtained as a smooth limit of standard wilson loops ( [ bc ] ) with @xmath7 from below .",
    "we suggest that it should be regarded instead as arising from an approach to @xmath14 from above .",
    "finally , we note in ( [ q ] ) that , despite the fact that one can not continuously interpolate between the spacelike worldsheet considered in @xcite and the timelike worldsheets studied in the present paper , the @xmath15 dependence that is central to the definition of the parameter @xmath3 in @xcite is in fact available in the @xmath7 limit of a subset of the configurations analyzed here . by analogy with @xcite",
    ", one can then define a parameter @xmath16 that , at least in this specific example , captures exactly the same information as ( and is in close numerical agreement with ) @xmath3 .",
    "in the course of our investigation two related papers were posted on the arxiv .",
    "while our work was in progress , the paper @xcite appeared , whose section 4.2 discusses drag effects for mesons with spin in a certain confining non - supersymmetric gauge theory , arriving at conclusions which coincide with those of our section [ stringsec ] .",
    "while the first version of our paper was in preparation , the work @xcite appeared , which analyzes exactly the same quark - antiquark system as we do , focusing on the velocity - dependence of the screening length ( for an arbitrary angle @xmath17 between the direction of motion and the quark - antiquark separation @xmath11 ) , which we determine ( for @xmath18 ) in our section [ qqbarsec ] .",
    "their numerical results are in complete agreement with ours , but as discussed above ( [ lstar ] ) , their definition of the screening length differs from ours for velocities @xmath19 .",
    "we should also note two additional developments that took place after the first version of this paper had appeared : first , the addition of a plot to @xcite ( fig . 16 ) , showing a meson size that scales with velocity in a manner compatible with the results for the screening length obtained in @xcite and the present paper ; second , the appearance of the work @xcite , which generalizes the screening length calculation to a large class of backgrounds , arriving at an analytic determination of the velocity - dependence in the ultra - relativistic regime .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the computation in @xcite of the drag force felt by an external quark moving through @xmath0 sym plasma focuses on a string that extends all the way from the boundary to the horizon of an ads - schwarzschild geometry , i.e. , from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , with @xmath22 an appropriate radial coordinate that we will henceforth also use as spatial worldsheet coordinate .",
    "we will in addition employ the boundary time @xmath23 as worldsheet time , so altogether we work in the static gauge @xmath24 the dynamics of the string are described by the nambu - goto action @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the the spacetime metric and @xmath27 the induced worldsheet metric .",
    "the force that a given segment of the string exerts along spatial direction @xmath28 on the neighboring segment was expressed in @xcite as @xmath29 with @xmath30 the worldsheet current associated with spacetime momentum , whereas in @xcite it was formulated as @xmath31 with @xmath32 the canonical momentum densities conjugate to @xmath33 . by explicitly inverting the @xmath34 matrix @xmath35",
    ", one can easily verify that @xmath36 and so the expressions ( [ forceg ] ) and ( [ forceh ] ) coincide .",
    "clearly the latter is simpler to use in explicit computations .",
    "the crucial point in the calculation of @xcite is the observation that , if this string is assumed to travel at constant velocity @xmath37 along a direction @xmath38 parallel to the boundary , then there is a certain velocity - dependent value of the radial coordinate , @xmath39 below which the embedding function @xmath40 for the string would become imaginary . the only way to avoid",
    "this is to let the string trail behind its boundary endpoint following a specific profile @xmath41constant , which translates into a specific value for the drag force @xmath42 exerted on the endpoint . in short , the non - zero value of the drag force",
    "is set uniquely by the condition that the string crosses the critical radius @xmath43 .    in this section",
    "we are interested in exploring how these considerations generalize to a moving string that has _ both _ of its endpoints on the boundary , and is therefore dual not to a single quark but to a quark - antiquark pair in the gauge theory .",
    "since the string now extends first away from and then back to the boundary , the static gauge choice @xmath44 leads of course to a double - valued parametrization , but this poses no problem other than the need to check by hand that the two halves of the string join together smoothly ( which ensures that the action is extremized not just piecewise , but over the entire worldsheet ) . to describe a moving quark - antiquark pair , both of the string endpoints are taken to travel with the same velocity @xmath5 in the @xmath45 direction , and to be separated by a constant distance @xmath11 along a certain boundary direction @xmath46 .",
    "in other words , with a convenient choice of origin , the embedding functions ( [ x ] ) and @xmath47 satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath48 where the upper ( lower ) signs refer to the left ( right ) half of the string .",
    "for concreteness , we specialize immediately to the case where @xmath49 is perpendicular to the direction of motion @xmath45 , which among other reasons is of particular interest in view of the connection with @xcite .",
    "the string starts at @xmath20 and extends down to a minimal radius @xmath50 , which by symmetry is such that @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( which is of course the condition that the projections of the two halves of the string onto the @xmath53 plane can be glued together smoothly ) .",
    "is shown at the top and the boundary at @xmath20 is represented by the plane at the bottom . the dash - dot line at @xmath54 marks a velocity - dependent radius beyond which the string can not penetrate . as the string moves to the right , its endpoints ( dual to the external quark and antiquark ) trace out the dotted trajectories .",
    "its shape codifies information on the configuration of the sym color fields .",
    "( a ) one might expect the string to lean backward as a result of the motion .",
    "this turns out to be possible only if the string has a nontrivial time - dependence .",
    "( b ) the lowest - energy configuration for the moving string is in fact upright , similar to the one obtained in the static case .",
    "see text for further discussion.,width=566,height=302 ]    ( 0,0 ) ( -13.2,-.7)@xmath55 ( -14.5,4.5)@xmath50 ( -11,3.4)@xmath49 ( -10,1.4)@xmath45 ( -11.8,5)@xmath22 ( -7.8,5.5)@xmath43 ( -7.8,7.8)@xmath56 ( -11.8,2)@xmath11 ( -11,4.5)@xmath57 ( -10.8,4.8)@xmath5 ( -4.8,-.7)@xmath58 ( -2.7,3.4)@xmath49 ( -1.7,1.4)@xmath45 ( -3.4,5)@xmath22 ( -4.5,4.5)@xmath50 ( -3.4,2)@xmath11 ( -1.5,4.5)@xmath57 ( -1.3,4.8)@xmath5 ( -7.8,1.7)@xmath59    .5 cm    the main question is whether such a string also trails behind its endpoints and exerts a drag force on them , as would seem compulsory if the string crosses @xmath43 , and might appear natural more generally on physical grounds .",
    "the shape of the string would then be similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ string]a .",
    "it is easy to see , however , that this can not happen .",
    "the reason is that , on the one hand , the force along the direction of motion must vanish at the midpoint ( @xmath60 ) , because by symmetry the string at that point must be perpendicular to the @xmath45-axis , and on the other hand , the force must be constant along the string , because each of its segments moves at constant velocity .",
    "we conclude then that @xmath61 everywhere , which implies that the string remains upright , as in fig .",
    "[ string]b .",
    "since we initially envisioned the string as being pulled along from its endpoints , it might seem somewhat counterintuitive that it does not lean backward . to clarify this point ,",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath22-independence of @xmath62 is a consequence of the equation of motion for @xmath63 ( or , equivalently , the covariant conservation law for the momentum current @xmath64 ) , @xmath65 where the first term vanishes due to the trivial time - dependence of the embedding functions ( [ x ] ) and ( [ y ] ) ( while the right - hand side vanishes because @xmath66 is independent of @xmath63 ) .",
    "from this it becomes clear that the conclusion of the previous paragraph can be avoided , and the string can lean backward , if and only if it displays a more complicated time dependence ( e.g. , some type of oscillatory behavior ) .",
    "the basic issue here is a familiar one : specifying boundary conditions for the string does not select a unique solution to the corresponding equation of motion ; one must additionally specify initial conditions .",
    "if the string is initially upright and moving as a whole at velocity @xmath5 , then as we have seen it will continue to do so , and its endpoints will trace the required paths without requiring an external agent that pulls on them in the direction of motion . on the other hand ,",
    "if the string is initially static and _ then _ we start pulling its endpoints with whatever force is necessary for them to move at constant velocity @xmath5 , the string _ will _ of course lean backward , as in fig .  [ string]a .",
    "what we have learned above , however , is that such a string will continue to oscillate and will never ( classically ) stabilize to a configuration of the type ( [ x ] ) .",
    "the solution in question is therefore clearly not the one with the lowest energy for the given boundary conditions .",
    "nevertheless , as we will see in the next section , there are circumstances under which this type of solution might conceivably play a role in the computation of the energy for the quark - antiquark system of interest to us .",
    "we should similarly keep in mind that it is possible to satisfy the boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) with two _ separate _ strings that reach all the way down from the boundary to the horizon at fixed @xmath67 , trailing behind their endpoints as described in @xcite .",
    "such configuration would clearly describe an unbound quark and antiquark , and it will also be of relevance below .",
    "let us now proceed towards the determination of the shape of the moving string in the ads - schwarzschild background . using the explicit form of the metric , but we display only the metric for the first factor because the string is taken to lie at a fixed position on the @xmath68 . ] @xmath69 together with the embedding functions ( [ x ] ) and ( [ y ] ) , the lagrangian density ( [ ng ] ) simplifies to @xmath70 the associated non - vanishing canonical momentum densities are @xmath71~ , \\nonumber\\\\ \\pi^{t}_{x}&=&{v\\over\\sqrt{-g}}\\left[{1\\over h } + \\frac{1}{h}y^{'2 } \\right]~ , \\nonumber\\\\ \\pi^{r}_{t}&=&{v\\over\\sqrt{-g}}\\left[\\frac{h}{h}x^{'}\\right]~,\\\\ \\pi^{r}_{x}&=&{-1\\over\\sqrt{-g}}\\left[\\frac{h}{h}x^{'}\\right]~,\\nonumber\\\\ \\pi^{r}_{y}&=&{-1\\over\\sqrt{-g}}\\left[\\frac{h - v^2}{h}y^{'}\\right]~.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as already noted above , given that the string moves at constant velocity and @xmath66 is independent of @xmath63 , the corresponding equation of motion ( [ conservation ] ) is just the statement that the conjugate momentum density @xmath72 is a ( real ) constant , which we will denote @xmath73 in what follows .",
    "the same is of course true for @xmath74 . according to ( [ forceh ] ) , these constants determine the forces @xmath75 and @xmath76 that an external agent must exert on the string endpoints to satisfy the given dirichlet boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) .",
    "this agent supplies energy to the string at a rate @xmath77 , which as expected is seen from ( [ pisfull ] ) to equal the work @xmath78 .",
    "inverting the relations ( [ pisfull ] ) to express @xmath79 and @xmath80 in terms of the constants @xmath73 and @xmath81 , we obtain @xmath82 @xmath83 where we notice the appearance of the same factor @xmath84 whose vanishing defined the critical radius ( [ rv ] ) that as explained above played a crucial role in fixing the value @xmath85 for the string dual to a moving quark @xcite .",
    "there are two immediate things we can learn from the above equations .",
    "first , we see from ( [ ecuaciondey ] ) that @xmath80 diverges at the point where the denominator vanishes ; according to the characterization following ( [ y ] ) this defines the turnaround point @xmath50 : @xmath86_{r = r_{min}}=\\pi_y^2~.\\ ] ] it is easy to show from this expression that @xmath87 , where equality holds only if @xmath88 ( which would imply @xmath89 ) .",
    "so , as expected , we find that the string dual to the moving quark - antiquark pair can not penetrate beyond the critical radius @xmath43 .",
    "second , in order for the projections of the two halves of the string onto the @xmath90 plane to join smoothly , we must require that @xmath91 at @xmath50 , but taking the quotient of ( [ ecuaciondey ] ) and ( [ ecuaciondex ] ) we see that this is _ not _ possible unless @xmath92 , and therefore @xmath93 .",
    "so , as we had already anticipated , we learn that the string can only move at constant speed if it is upright .",
    "this same conclusion has been reached independently in @xcite .",
    "specializing ( [ ecuaciondey ] ) , ( [ rminfull ] ) , ( [ lagrangianfull ] ) and ( [ pisfull ] ) to the case @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) , we can now derive the equations that will be of interest to us in the remainder of this paper .",
    "the profile of the upright @xmath95-shaped string that moves with velocity @xmath5 and has endpoint separation @xmath11 is determined by @xmath96 where the value of @xmath81 must be chosen in such a way that @xmath97 with @xmath98    using ( [ yprime ] ) , the lagrangian density ( [ lagrangianfull ] ) reduces to @xmath99 close to the boundary we find @xmath100 , which upon integration implies that the total worldsheet area per unit boundary time is linearly divergent an obvious consequence of the fact that the string extends all the way to spatial infinity .",
    "the same divergence is found in the area of the two disconnected worldsheets dual to the unbound quark and antiquark , described by ( [ lagrangianfull])-([ecuaciondey ] ) with @xmath88 and @xmath73 as in ( [ gub ] ) , which result in @xmath101 .",
    "subtracting the two areas we find the finite expression to make both integrals finite , subtract , and in the end take @xmath102 .",
    "in the dual gauge theory , this is equivalent to introducing a uv cutoff @xmath103 . ]",
    "@xmath104 according to the standard recipe @xcite , in the dual finite - temperature gauge theory , the relative area ( [ wilson ] ) determines the expectation value ( in a stationary phase approximation ) of the wilson loop traced by the moving quark - antiquark pair .",
    "we are also interested in computing the total energy of the @xmath95-shaped string , which translates into the energy of the quark - antiquark pair . starting from ( [ pisfull ] ) , the hamiltonian density @xmath105 works out to @xmath106 as expected",
    ", the behavior of this expression near the boundary gives rise to a linear divergence in the total energy of the string , which could again be cancelled by subtracting the energy of the disconnected strings dual to the unbound quark and antiquark , obtained from integrating @xmath107 this subtraction , however , would introduce a new infinity , because ( [ hunbound ] ) implies that the energy of each of the moving unbound strings is logarithmically divergent at the @xmath21 endpoint of the integration @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of this divergence is the infinite amount of energy that has been provided to the system by the external agent that has pulled the boundary endpoint of the string along the @xmath45 direction for an infinite period of time . from the perspective of a boundary observer ,",
    "over the course of time this energy has flowed along the string and accumulated in the vicinity of the horizon .    as explained in @xcite , a simple estimate of the work done on the trailing string by the external agent",
    "is obtained by assuming that it has exerted precisely the force needed to overcome the constant drag force ( [ gub ] ) over exactly the ( infinite ) distance that separates the front ( boundary ) and back ( horizon ) endpoints of the string .",
    "a short calculation shows that this amounts to identifying @xmath108 as the energy density provided by the external agent . subtracting this from ( [ hunbound ] )",
    ", we obtain an estimate of the energy density ` intrinsic ' to the moving string , @xmath109 which , as expected , no longer includes the logarithmically - divergent portion .",
    "the prescription for eliminating this divergence is of course highly non - unique : one may add to ( [ hinput ] ) _ any _ function @xmath110 such that @xmath111 ( in order for @xmath112 to represent a finite renormalization of the string energy ) and @xmath113 ( to continue to match the known energy of the static string ) .    for use",
    "below , it is convenient to note here that a completely analogous story applies to the linear momentum @xmath114 of the unbound strings @xcite : upon integration , the momentum density @xmath115 which follows from ( [ pisfull ] ) leads to both a linear divergence at @xmath20 and a log divergence at @xmath21 ; the latter is a reflection of the infinite amount of momentum provided by the external agent , which can be estimated to be @xmath116 ; the remaining @xmath117 is then an estimate of the momentum density intrinsic to the moving string .",
    "the preceding discussion points towards @xmath118 as a simple and finite expression that codifies the energy of the moving @xmath95-shaped string relative to that of the two moving disconnected strings , or , in dual language , the energy of the quark - antiquark pair relative to that of the unbound quark and antiquark .",
    "this definition captures , for any given @xmath5 , the correct @xmath11-dependence of the energy of the bound system .",
    "the arbitrariness involved in the choice of the function @xmath119 leads , however , to two important drawbacks : it denies meaning to a direct comparison of values of the energy computed at different velocities , and makes it impossible to deduce from the value of @xmath120 alone whether , for a given @xmath11 and @xmath5 , the energetics favor the bound or the unbound configuration .",
    "the resolution of these problems will require establishing an unequivocal operational definition of the intrinsic energy of the moving unbound strings ( a natural suggestion was made in @xcite ) .    as we have seen ,",
    "the source of the ambiguity in the definition of @xmath120 is the infinite amount of energy supplied to the unbound strings by the agent that drags them , so a natural way to sidestep this difficulty is to compute the energy in the string rest frame , where the external agent does no work .",
    "the requisite coordinate transformation is of course @xmath121 ( with @xmath122 ) and amounts , from the gauge theory point of view , to a lorentz boost that takes us from the rest frame of the plasma , where we had worked up to now , to the rest frame of the quark and antiquark . the canonical momentum densities ( [ pisfull ] ) transform according to @xmath123 where we have taken into account the effect of the change from the static gauge in the plasma rest frame ( @xmath124 ) to the static gauge in the quark rest frame ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath126 , which shows that , as expected , in this frame no energy is being supplied to the string .",
    "the total energy of the unbound strings will consequently have no logarithmic divergence , and its linear divergence will serve to cancel that of the @xmath95-shaped string in the usual straightforward way . because the string is static , we find @xmath127 , and from the fact that the lagrangian transforms as a scalar density it follows that @xmath128 , so the energy of the bound system relative to that of the unbound system , @xmath129 is related to the area ( [ wilson ] ) through @xmath130 , just like it should .",
    "we stress that in this frame we have been able to cleanly subtract the energy of the unbound strings without introducing any ambiguities , so both the @xmath11- and @xmath5-dependence of ( [ ebar ] ) are physically meaningful , and the bound configuration is known to be energetically preferred whenever @xmath131 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in contrast with the energy , even in the rest frame the linear momentum of the string _ can not _ be defined unequivocally without additional physical input . even though the external agent does no work on either the bound or unbound strings , in the latter case it does supply momentum to the static string : in gauge theory language , a force must be exerted to hold the isolated quark in place as the plasma flows by at speed @xmath5 . as a result , the momentum density @xmath132 for the disconnected strings gives rise to a logarithmic divergence at the @xmath21 endpoint of the integration",
    "this may be eliminated by subtracting the estimate @xmath133 for the momentum supplied by the external agent , which can be obtained either by lorentz - transforming @xmath134 to the barred frame , or by recomputing directly in the barred frame under assumptions parallel to those that led to ( [ hinput ] ) .",
    "after this subtraction , one would be left with @xmath135 as an estimate of the momentum intrinsically associated with the string .",
    "this vanishing result might at first sight appear natural and unambiguous , since the string is , after all , at rest . that the issue is not this simple becomes clear upon observing that the momentum density for the @xmath95-shaped string , @xmath136 is non - vanishing , despite the fact that this string is also at rest , and no external momentum has been supplied to it .",
    "this is only possible because in the barred frame @xmath137 , so the metric is not static .",
    "we will come back to this discussion in the next section .",
    "in this section we will use the above results for the moving string to make various inferences about the dual system : an external quark - antiquark pair in @xmath138 @xmath0 sym with ",
    "t  hooft coupling @xmath139 and temperature @xmath140 determined by the ads radius @xmath141 , horizon radius @xmath56 and string length @xmath142 through @xcite @xmath143    according to ( [ forceh ] ) , the fact that @xmath92 translates into the statement that , in stark contrast with the solitary quark considered in @xcite , an external quark - antiquark pair feels no drag force as it ploughs through the plasma , a curious result that was obtained independently in the recent paper @xcite .",
    "as explained in @xcite and analyzed more closely in @xcite , a moving quark produces an extended wake in the color fields , which may be regarded as a coherent spray of gluons radiated away from the quark , and is the cft dual of the trailing string that extends all the way down to the horizon .",
    "it is this wake that transports energy and momentum away from the quark and into the surrounding medium .",
    "it is worth noting that this mechanism can operate even at zero temperature , where there is no plasma : given appropriate initial conditions for the gluonic fields , a quark moving at constant speed _ can _ lose energy to the wake it imprints on these fields .",
    "the dual statement is that a string on pure ads that displays a non - trivial time - dependence _ can _ trail behind its boundary endpoint even if the latter moves at constant velocity . ) ; its sym dual could be verified through calculations similar to those performed in @xcite . ]",
    "this , of course , should not come as a surprise , because the sym vacuum constitutes , after all , a highly nonlinear polarizable medium .",
    "needless to say , the lowest - energy configuration for the gluonic field profile surrounding the moving quark at zero temperature is the one obtained by boosting the static profile ; this configuration is dual to an upright string , which feels no drag force .",
    "the string considered in @xcite correctly reduces to this case when @xmath144 , which ensures that the energy loss process studied there is intrinsically associated with the presence of the plasma .    unlike the single quark , which carries a net color charge ,",

    "<S> we make use of the ads / cft correspondence to determine the energy of an external quark - antiquark pair that moves through strongly - coupled thermal @xmath0 super - yang - mills plasma , both in the rest frame of the plasma and in the rest frame of the pair . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the pair feels no drag force , has an energy that reproduces the expected @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) behavior at small quark - antiquark separations , and becomes unbound beyond a certain screening length whose velocity - dependence we determine . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the relation between the high - velocity limit of our results and the lightlike wilson loop proposed recently as a definition of the jet - quenching parameter . </S>"
