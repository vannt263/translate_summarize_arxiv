    "relativistic aspects of quantum mechanics have recently attracted much attention , especially in the context of the theory of quantum information .",
    "one of the important questions in this context is how to define the reduced spin density matrix .",
    "such a matrix should enable one to make statistical predictions for the outcomes of ideal spin measurements which are not influenced by the particle momentum .",
    "we consider this problem in detail in the case of massive particles .",
    "the reduced spin density matrix is usually defined by the following formula @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the complete density matrix of a single particle with mass @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the lorentz ",
    "invariant measure on the mass shell and four - momentum eigenvectors @xmath4 ( i.e. , @xmath5 ) span the space of the irreducible representation of the poincar group .",
    "they are normalized as follows @xmath6 the action of the lorentz transformation @xmath7 on the vector @xmath4 is of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the matrix spin @xmath10 representation of the @xmath11 group , @xmath12 is the wigner rotation and @xmath13 designates the standard lorentz boost defined by the relations @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the key question is whether the reduced density matrix is covariant . in @xcite",
    "it was stressed that the matrix ( [ red_density_standard ] ) is not covariant under lorentz boosts .",
    "it means that when we calculate the complete density matrix as seen by the boosted observer @xmath17 and then the reduced spin density matrix @xmath18 ( using eq .",
    "( [ red_density_standard ] ) with @xmath1 replaced with @xmath19 ) we find that we can not express @xmath20 only in terms of @xmath21 and @xmath7 .",
    "the reason is quite obvious  the wigner rotation in the transformation law ( [ transf_states_standard ] ) is momentum dependent , except of the case @xmath22 . from the group theoretical point of view",
    "it is related to the fact that the lorentz group and the rotation group are not homomorphic .",
    "notice that in the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics it is possible to define the galilean  covariant reduced density matrix by the formula analogous to eq .",
    "( [ red_density_standard ] ) @xcite because such a homomorphism exists .",
    "as was pointed out in @xcite matrix ( [ red_density_standard ] ) is not always relevant to the discussion of relativistic aspects of polarization experiments ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason we propose here another definition of the reduced density matrix .",
    "this definition relies on the analogy with the polarization tensors formalism used in quantum field theory . as a result",
    "we obtain the finite  dimensional matrix which contains not only the information about the polarization of the particle but also the information about _ average _ values of the kinematical degrees of freedom",
    ". moreover , such a matrix transforms covariantly under the lorentz group action .    to begin with",
    "we introduce vectors @xmath23 such that @xmath24 which are assumed to transform under lorentz transformation @xmath7 due to the following , manifestly covariant , rule @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a given finite  dimensional lorentz group representation",
    ". consistency of the rules ( [ transf_states_standard ] , [ states_new ] , [ transf_states_new ] ) leads to the weinberg  like condition @xcite which has to be fulfilled : @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes matrix @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "thus to calculate @xmath28 it is enough to determine @xmath30 and use the formula @xmath31 which is a consequence of eq.([weinberg_condition ] ) .",
    "assuming that the condition ( [ weinberg_condition ] ) can be solved we can define the following ( unnormalized ) covariant reduced density matrix : @xmath32 we can easily check that this matrix is manifestly covariant under the transformation ( [ complete_matrix_transf ] ) , namely we have @xmath33 where @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "one can also easily verify that the matrix ( [ reduced_density_new ] ) is hermitian and positive semidefinite ( similarly as ( [ red_density_standard ] ) ) . transformation ( [ reduced_density_new_transf ] ) preserves hermicity and positive semidefiniteness of @xmath35 but changes its trace .",
    "it is clear that we can define also normalized density matrix @xmath36 such a matrix transforms according to the rule @xmath37 one can check immediately that eq .",
    "( [ transf_normalized ] ) gives a nonlinear realization of the lorentz group connected with the quotient space @xmath38 .",
    "therefore this realization is linear on the rotation group .",
    "however , to extract information about polarization of the particle it does not matter which matrix we use , @xmath35 or @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , when we consider representations of the full lorentz group ( i.e. , including inversions ) the most convenient choice is to consider the matrix @xmath40 where @xmath41 fulfills the condition @xmath42 which means that in this representation @xmath41 represents space inversions .",
    "thus the matrix @xmath43 transforms under the lorentz group action in the following way : @xmath44 we see that transformation ( [ transf_omega ] ) does not change the trace of @xmath43 .",
    "of course , having @xmath43 we can easily determine @xmath35 and normalized density matrix @xmath39 .",
    "hereafter we restrict ourselves to the case of a spin-1/2 particle ; generalization to the higher spin is immediate . in this case",
    "the weinberg condition ( [ weinberg_condition ] ) can be easily solved .",
    "we want to consider representations of the full lorentz group thus we choose as the representation @xmath45 the bispinor representation @xmath46 , so @xmath47 in this case . explicitly ,",
    "if @xmath48 and @xmath49 is an image of @xmath50 in the canonical homomorphism of the @xmath51 group onto the lorentz group , we take the chiral form of @xmath52 , namely @xmath53 the canonical homomorphism between the group @xmath51 ( universal covering of the proper ortochronous lorentz group @xmath54 ) and the lorentz group @xmath55 @xcite is defined as follows : with every four - vector @xmath56 we associate a two - dimensional hermitian matrix @xmath57 such that @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , are the standard pauli matrices and @xmath61 . in the space of two - dimensional hermitian matrices ( [ matrix_k ] ) the lorentz group action is given by @xmath62 , where @xmath50 denotes the element of the @xmath51 group corresponding to the lorentz transformation @xmath49 which converts the four - vector @xmath63 to @xmath64 ( i.e. , @xmath65 ) and @xmath66 .",
    "now , the explicit solution of the weinberg condition ( [ weinberg_condition ] ) under our choice of @xmath45 ( eq.([representation ] ) ) is given by @xmath67 where @xmath57 is given by eq .",
    "( [ matrix_k ] ) and @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "as is well known , the intertwining matrix @xmath28 fulfills the dirac equation @xmath70 where @xmath71 are dirac matrices , @xmath72 .",
    "the explicit representation of dirac matrices used in the present paper is summarized in appendix a.    now we discuss the general structure of the reduced density matrix ( [ reduced_density_new ] ) for @xmath73 .",
    "we show that this matrix contains information about both average polarization as well as kinematical degrees of freedom .",
    "recall that the polarization of the relativistic particle is determined by the pauli  lubanski four - vector @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a four - momentum operator and @xmath76 denotes generators of the lorentz group , i.e. , @xmath77 .",
    "we will also use the spin tensor @xmath78 defined by the formula @xcite @xmath79 now , the @xmath80 reduced spin density matrix @xmath35 can be written as the following combination @xmath81\\gamma^0\\big ) .",
    "\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] real coefficients @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 can be determined by calculating corresponding traces .",
    "thus , after some algebra , using eqs.([reduced_density_new ] , [ omega_def ] , [ amplitude][spin_tensor ] ) and ( [ normalization][additional_relations ] ) we get @xmath87)=   \\left < s_{\\mu\\nu}\\right>_{\\hat{\\rho } } ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 denotes the mean value of the observable @xmath50 in the state described by the complete density matrix @xmath1 , @xmath89 .",
    "notice that the above relations are not accidental , since @xmath90 is a canonical four - velocity operator for the dirac particle and @xmath91 $ ] are lorentz group generators in the bispinor representation .",
    "thus , finally , the matrix @xmath92 has the following form : @xmath93 .",
    "\\label{omega_final }   \\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    it can be also checked that in the nonrelativistic limit we have    @xmath94    [ nonrelativistic ]    the formalism we have introduced above can be straightforward generalized to the multiparticle case . as an example we shall discuss briefly the reduced spin density matrix for two massive particles .",
    "particle hilbert space is spanned by vectors @xmath95 , where @xmath23 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ states_new ] ) .",
    "therefore we define the two - particle unnormalized reduced density matrix as follows : @xmath96 where @xmath1 denotes the complete two  particle density matrix .",
    "it is obvious that the matrix ( [ reduced_two_particle ] ) is hermitian , positive  semidefinite and can be easily normalized similarly like in the one  particle case .",
    "moreover , in the case of two spin @xmath97 particles we define @xmath98",
    "now let us discuss the case of the particle with a sharp momentum , say @xmath99 , and polarization determined by the bloch vector @xmath100 , @xmath101 , i.e. , we assume that the complete density matrix has the following matrix elements @xmath102 of course the normalization factor @xmath103 should be understood as the result of the proper regularization procedure . now , using eqs .",
    "( [ reduced_density_new ] ) and ( [ additional_relations ] ) we can find the corresponding matrix @xmath43 . we have @xmath104 where the four - vector @xmath105 is given in this case by @xmath106 i.e. , @xmath107 is obtained from @xmath108 by applying the lorentz boost @xmath109 .",
    "it should also be noted that @xmath110 .",
    "the matrix ( [ omega_sharp ] ) is known in the literature as the spin density matrix for dirac particle @xcite .",
    "now , to connect the density matrix introduced above with some macroscopic experiments like the stern ",
    "gerlach one let us consider a charged particle with sharp momentum moving in the external electromagnetic field .",
    "we assume that the giromagnetic ratio @xmath111 .",
    "the momentum and polarization of such a particle vary in time , thus they can be regarded as functions of its proper time @xmath21 : @xmath112 the expectation value of the operators representing the spin and the momentum will necessarily follow the same time dependence as one would obtain from the classical equations of motion @xcite : @xmath113 , \\label{trajectory}\\\\   \\frac{dw^\\mu}{d\\tau } = & \\zeta \\big [ f^{\\mu}_{\\phantom{\\mu}\\nu }   w^\\nu + \\frac{1}{m^2}q^\\mu    ( w^\\sigma f_{\\sigma\\alpha } q^\\alpha ) \\big ] ,   \\label{eq_motion_w }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath114 denotes the charge of the particle , @xmath2 its mass , @xmath115 is the proportionality constant between the magnetic moment of the particle @xmath116 and @xmath117 i.e.@xmath118 and giromagnetic ratio @xmath119 @xmath120@xcite . ] and @xmath121 is the tensor of the external electromagnetic field , @xmath122 .",
    "( [ eq_motion_w ] ) describes thomas precession of the spin vector in the electromagnetic field @xcite while eq .",
    "( [ trajectory ] ) allows one to determine the trajectory of the spinning particle moving in the electromagnetic field @xmath121 .",
    "the slow motion limit of the above equations takes the well  known form @xcite @xmath123 where we assumed that the electric component of the electromagnetic field is equal to zero .",
    "( [ stern_gerlach_1][stern_gerlach_2 ] ) describe forces acting on the particle in the stern  gerlach experiment , therefore we can really identify @xmath100 with the polarization of the particle .",
    "in this simple case of the monochromatic particle we can also calculate explicitly the von nuemann entropy of the reduced density matrix .",
    "the matrix @xmath43 in the rest frame of the particle can be written as @xmath124 to calculate entropy we have to use the normalized density matrix @xmath125 , but in this particular case @xmath126 .",
    "thus the von neumann entropy of the state ( [ matrix_rest ] ) is equal to @xmath127 now , to find the entropy in the arbitrary lorentz frame we apply to the matrix @xmath125 the lorentz transformation ( [ transf_normalized ] ) with @xmath26 given by ( [ representation ] ) and we find that entropy of the corresponding reduced density matrix @xmath128 is given by ( [ entropy ] ) too , i.e. , @xmath129 .",
    "therefore for a particle with the sharp momentum the entropy of the reduced density matrix does not change under lorentz transformations",
    ". however , in the case of an arbitrary momentum distribution , the entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath39 is not in general lorentz  invariant .",
    "in the next section we will use our formalism to calculate the einstein  podolsky  rosen ",
    "bohm ( epr  bohm ) correlation function .",
    "thus we have to introduce the spin operator for a relativistic massive particle .",
    "the choice is not obvious since in the discussion of relativistic epr  bohm experiments various spin operators have been used @xcite .",
    "however our previous considerations ( eqs.([pauli_lubanski_sharp])([stern_gerlach_2 ] ) ) as well as the classical definition of the relativistic spin @xcite suggest that the best candidate for the spin operator is @xmath130 which corresponds to the classical polarization vector @xmath100 ( precisely to @xmath131 ) in eq .",
    "( [ pauli_lubanski_sharp ] ) .",
    "this operator is also used in quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "it fulfills the following standard commutation relations :    @xmath132=i\\varepsilon_{ijk}\\hat{s}^k,\\\\   [ \\hat{s}^i,\\hat{s}^j]=i\\varepsilon_{ijk}\\hat{s}^k ,     \\label{spin_commutator } \\\\    [ \\hat{p}^\\mu,\\hat{s}^j]=0 ,   \\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    [ spin_all_commutators ]    which should be satisfied for the spin operator . here",
    "@xmath133 and one can show that it is the only operator which is a linear function of @xmath134 and fulfills relations ( [ spin_all_commutators ] ) @xcite .    therefore the operator corresponding to the spin projection along arbitrary direction @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) in the representation of gamma matrices ( [ gamma_explicit ] ) reads explicitly @xmath137 where we have used eqs .",
    "( [ pauli_lubanski_explicit ] ) .",
    "( [ spin_commutator ] ) implies that eigenvalues of the operator @xmath138 are integers or half  integers .",
    "as one can easily check by direct calculation the eigenvalues of the operator ( [ ns ] ) are equal to @xmath139 .",
    "this observation supports our choice of the operator @xmath140 as the spin operator .",
    "now we want to express the average of the spin operator ( [ spin ] ) in terms of the reduced matrix @xmath43 .",
    "one can check that in an arbitrary state @xmath141 @xmath142 thus a reasonable choice for the normalized average of the spin component is @xmath143 when @xmath144 describes a particle with a sharp momentum @xmath63 the normalized average is simply the average of @xmath145 , i.e. , inserting reduced density matrix @xmath43 ( [ omega_sharp ] ) into ( [ spin_average_sharp ] ) we get @xmath146    it should also be noted that in the nonrelativistic limit we recover the result ( [ spin_average_sharp_sigma ] ) for an arbitrary state @xmath141 @xmath147",
