    "the study of unstable nuclei is a subject of current experimental and theoretical interests .",
    "self - consistent theories such as the hartree - fock bogoliubov theory ( hfb ) and the quasi - particle random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) , which have extensively been used for stable nuclei , have also been applied to unstable nuclei , and the importance of ground - state correlations has been demonstrated @xcite . introducing a pairing field , hfb and qrpa deal with pairing correlations in the framework of a mean field theory .",
    "in contrast to hfb and qrpa , the time - dependent density - matrix theory ( tddm ) @xcite , which is one of extended time - dependent hartree - fock theories , deals with ground - state correlations as genuine two - body correlations .",
    "tddm has been applied to giant resonances in stable nuclei @xcite and also to low - lying collective states in unstable nuclei @xcite .",
    "the small amplitude limit of tddm ( stddm ) @xcite , which is a time - independent version of tddm , has also been used to calculate low - lying states in an oxygen isotope @xcite .",
    "the importance of ground - state correlations has also been demonstrated by these tddm and stddm calculations .",
    "the correlated ground state used in these nuclear structure calculations , however , is an approximate one which is obtained using a time - dependent method : the initial hartree - fock ( hf ) ground state is evolved in time using the equations of motion in tddm and a time - dependent residual interaction whose strength gradually approaches its intended value with a time constant @xmath2 . in the case of a solvable model where we can take @xmath2 quite large ,",
    "the ground state obtained has been found practically stationary and close to the exact one@xcite .",
    "however , in realistic cases where it is difficult to take sufficiently large @xmath2 , the mixing of excited states , which causes spurious oscillations of some ground - state quantities , is unavoidable though it is small @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is anticipated to develop another method for finding a correlated ground state of the tddm equations . in this paper",
    "we propose a time - independent approach based on newton s gradient method and demonstrate its feasibility by calculating the ground state of @xmath0o for which we have previously performed time - dependent calculations @xcite .",
    "@xmath0o is one of neutron - rich nuclei which attracts recent experimental and theoretical interests , and is quite suitable for our present study : although it is an open shell nucleus , the hf assumption which we use to obtain a starting ground state in the gradient method is valid as first - order approximation , and the omission of the proton degrees of freedom may be allowed in this explorative study because of the proton shell closure .",
    "the obtained ground state is used to construct the hamiltonian matrix of stddm , and the first @xmath1 state and its two phonon states in @xmath0o are calculated .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect.2",
    "the time - independent method for obtaining a correlated ground state is presented . in sect.3 the formalism of stddm",
    "the results of numerical calculations for the ground - state , the first @xmath1 state , and its two phonon states are shown in sect.4 and sect.5 is devoted to a summary .",
    "the ground state @xmath3 in tddm is constructed so that @xmath4|\\phi_0\\rangle = 0 , \\label{grc1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath5|\\phi_0\\rangle = 0 , \\label{grc2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are satisfied , where @xmath6 is the total hamiltonian consisting of the kinetic energy term and a two - body interaction , and @xmath7 $ ] stands for the commutation relation . in other words , the occupation matrix @xmath8 and the two - body correlation matrix @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the antisymmetrization operator , are determined so that eqs.([grc1 ] ) and ( [ grc2 ] ) are satisfied .",
    "the expressions for eqs.([grc1 ] ) and ( [ grc2 ] ) have already been given in ref.@xcite but are shown again in appendix a. the single - particle wavefunction @xmath11 is chosen to be an eigenstate of the mean field hamiltonian @xmath12 : @xmath13=\\epsilon_{\\alpha}\\psi_{\\alpha}(1 ) , \\label{hf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the numbers denote space , spin , and isospin coordinates , and the one - body density matrix @xmath14 is given as @xmath15 attempts have been made to find a solution of eqs.([grc1 ] ) and ( [ grc2 ] ) @xcite .",
    "however , this is not evident partly because eqs.([grc1 ] ) and ( [ grc2 ] ) are not in the form of an eigenvalue problem .",
    "the time - dependent method has been developed and tested for a solvable model @xcite and realistic nuclei @xcite as mentioned above . in the following we propose a time - independent approach using iterative newton s gradient method .",
    "we start from the hf ground state where @xmath16 for occupied ( unoccupied ) single - particle states and @xmath17 .",
    "then we iterate @xmath18 until convergence is achieved , where the matrix elements @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , which also depend on the iteration step @xmath21 , are equivalent to those appearing in the hamiltonian matrix of stddm .",
    "they are given in ref.@xcite and also shown in appendix b. we have to introduce a small parameter @xmath22 to control the convergence process .",
    "we have tested this iterative method for a solvable model @xcite and found that the obtained result is equivalent to the solution which had been obtained using the time dependent approach @xcite .",
    "tddm gives the time - evolution of the one - body density - matrix @xmath23 and the correlated part @xmath24 of a two - body density - matrix @xcite , and stddm has been formulated by linearizing the equations of motion for @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the equations of stddm for the one - body amplitude @xmath25 and the two - body amplitude @xmath26 can be written in matrix form @xcite @xmath27 eq.([stddm1 ] ) can also be obtained from the following equations : @xmath28|\\phi\\rangle & = & \\omega_\\mu\\langle\\phi_0|a^+_{\\alpha'}a_{\\alpha}|\\phi\\rangle , \\label{var1 } \\\\ \\langle\\phi_0|[a^+_{\\alpha_1'}a^+_{\\alpha_2'}a_{\\alpha_2}a_{\\alpha_1},h]|\\phi\\rangle & = & \\omega_\\mu\\langle\\phi_0|a^+_{\\alpha_1'}a^+_{\\alpha_2'}a_{\\alpha_2}a_{\\alpha_1}|\\phi\\rangle , \\label{var2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the wavefunction for an excited state with excitation energy @xmath30 .",
    "linearizing eqs.([var1 ] ) and ( [ var2 ] ) with respect to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and using @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we can obtain eq.([stddm1 ] ) .",
    "the fact that the linearization of eqs.([var1 ] ) and ( [ var2 ] ) gives eq.([stddm1 ] ) might explain why the matrices @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath20 are given by the variation of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix of eq.([stddm1 ] ) is not hermitian as easily be understood from its explicit form ( see appendix b ) . in the case of a non - hermitian hamiltonian matrix ,",

    "the strength functions in stddm are not guaranteed to be positive definite , as is easily understood from eqs.([se1 ] ) and ( [ se2 ] ) . in practical applications",
    "this has not caused problems .",
    "in this subsection we present how the correlated ground state of @xmath0o is calculated and discuss some properties of the obtained ground state . to prepare the starting ground state for eq.([iteration ] ) , we perform a static hf calculation as the first step .",
    "the skyrme iii ( skiii ) is used as the effective interaction to generate a mean field .",
    "it has often been used as one of the standard parameterizations of the skyrme force in nuclear structure calculations even for very neutron rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "we assume in the hf calculation that @xmath68 is the last fully occupied neutron orbit of @xmath0o .",
    "since eq.([iteration ] ) involves matrix inversion at each iteration step , it is difficult to use a large number of single - particle states to solve eq.([iteration ] ) . in this explorative study",
    "we only use the two neutron orbits , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , to evolve @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "configurations consisting of these two orbits are considered to be the major components of the correlated ground state and the first @xmath1 state .",
    "the single - particle wavefunctions are confined to a sphere with radius 12 fm .",
    "the mesh size used is 0.1 fm . at each iteration step of eq.([iteration ] ) , eq.([hf ] ) is solved .",
    "this means that the single - particle states also evolve in a consistent way . in a self - consistent calculation",
    "the residual interaction should be the same as that used to generate the mean field .",
    "however , we had found in previous studies for giant resonances @xcite that skiii induces negligible ground - state correlations when the single - particle space is significantly truncated .",
    "this is the case also in this study of @xmath0o as will be shown below .",
    "therefore , we present the results using the following pairing - type residual interaction of the density - dependent @xmath70 function form @xcite which is known to induce significant ground - state correlations @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the nuclear density . the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath73 are set to be 0.16@xmath74 and @xmath75 mev @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "similar values of @xmath14 and @xmath73 have been used in hfb calculations @xcite in truncated single - particle space .",
    "the converged result somewhat depends on how the iteration process is chosen .",
    "we found that to achieve real convergence it is necessary to start with a small value of @xmath73 and gradually increase it : in the calculation shown below we start with @xmath77 and increase it by @xmath77 for each 100 iterations .",
    "the sum of the absolute values of the matrix elements of @xmath38 and @xmath39 is shown in fig.1 as a function of the number of iterations .",
    "the final value of @xmath78 at 2100th step is @xmath79mev .",
    "figure 1 demonstrates that the iteration method eq.([iteration ] ) works quite well .",
    "the final single - particle energies of the @xmath68 and @xmath69 are -6.9 mev and -2.8 mev , respectively .",
    "their occupation probabilities are 0.98 and 0.05 , respectively .",
    "the correlation energy @xmath80 defined as @xmath81 is -0.60 mev .",
    "the total energy is decreased by 0.22 mev from the hf value : the correlation energy is largely compensated by the increase of the hf energy .     and @xmath39 as a function of the number of iterations .",
    "each spike corresponds to an increase of the interaction strength by @xmath77 ( see text).,height=264 ]      using the correlated ground state shown above , we solve eq.([stddm1 ] ) and calculate the strength function for @xmath1 states according to eq.([se1 ] ) .",
    "to be consistent with the calculation of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , we only use the neutron @xmath68 and @xmath69 orbits for @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the eigenvalues of some @xmath1 states become imaginary because the hamiltonian matrix of eq.([stddm1 ] ) is not hermitian . however , their imaginary parts are quite small ( less than 0.05mev ) .",
    "some @xmath1 states have also negative quadrupole strengths because positivity of @xmath51 is not guaranteed . however , the negative contributions are so small that @xmath51 becomes positive in the entire energy region when it is smoothed with @xmath84mev .",
    "the obtained result for @xmath85 in stddm ( solid line ) is shown in fig.2 , where the strength functions in rpa ( dot - dashed line ) and srpa ( thin dotted line ) is also presented for comparison .",
    "the @xmath1 state calculated in stddm is energetically shifted upward and becomes significantly more collective as compared with that in rpa .",
    "the increase in the excitation energy is due to the lowering of the ground state , which is realized by the increase in the unperturbed p - h energy through the coupling to @xmath86 .",
    "we will discuss this point in more detail below .",
    "the enhancement of the collectivity of the @xmath1 state is due to the mixing of two - body configurations .",
    "these properties of the first @xmath1 state under the influence of ground - state correlations are similar to those obtained from qrpa calculations @xcite .",
    "the reduced transition probability obtained is 68 @xmath87 .",
    "if the neutron effective charge is assumed to be @xmath88 , the value of @xmath89 becomes 17 @xmath90@xmath87 , which might be comparable with the experimental value of @xmath91@xmath87 @xcite .",

    "the transition strength decreases with increasing @xmath94 , whereas it would be independent of @xmath94 if a pure phonon picture were valid . the ratios of the transition strengths of the @xmath1 and @xmath95 states to that of the @xmath96 state are 0.55 and 0.30 , respectively . these ratios should be compared with 4/5 and 1/3 , respectively , which are obtained assuming unperturbed two @xmath69 particle - two @xmath68 hole configurations .",

    "this originates in the nature of the residual interaction of the @xmath70-function form ( eq.([delta ] ) ) which strongly favors a nucleon pair with @xmath98 .",

    "the transition strengths in srpa are much smaller than those in stddm .",
    "note that fig .",
    "4 is drawn in the same scale as fig .",
    "it had been pointed out @xcite that the @xmath103 amplitude is important to reproduce the collectivity of low - lying two phonon states . to investigate this point",
    ", we performed a calculation for the @xmath96 state using a modified srpa ( msrpa ) which includes @xmath103 : msrpa can be obtained from eq.(6 ) by evaluating the hamiltonian matrix using the hf ground state . the result is shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath103 amplitude significantly enhances the collectivity of the @xmath96 state .",
    "however , the transition strength in msrpa is still smaller that that in stddm . in fig .",
    "5 we also show the result of a further modified srpa which includes all two - body amplitudes except for the 3p-1h , 1h-3p , 3h-1p and 1p-3h amplitudes .",
    "the 3p-1h and 3h-1p amplitudes do not increase the transition strength , although they change somewhat the form of the strength function .",
    "now the transition strength becomes 91% of the strength in stddm .",
    "thus all two - body amplitudes except for the 3p-1h and 3h-1p types seem to be important to describe the collectivity of the low - lying 2 phonon states .",
    "this is in contrast to two - phonon states of giant resonances where the transition strengths are exhausted by the 2p-2h , 2h-2p and 1p1h-1p1h amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the fact that the @xmath96 state in stddm is not much lowered as compared with the modified srpa results is due to ground - state correlations .",

    ", we neglected the spin - orbit force .",
    "since there is a strong cancellation between the momentum dependent and independent terms , skiii induces quite weak ground - state correlations in the truncated single - particle space considered in this work : the occupation probabilities of the @xmath68 and @xmath69 are 0.9999 and 0.0003 , respectively .",
    "the strength functions for the two - phonon states are shown in fig.6 .",
    "the ratios of the g.s.@xmath106 and @xmath95 transition strengths to the g.s.@xmath107 one are 0.77 and 0.33 , respectively , which are close to 4/5 and 1/3 obtained assuming the unperturbed configurations as discussed above .",
    "o calculated in stddm using skiii .",

    "is also shown with the thin solid line .",
    "the strength functions are smoothed with @xmath84 mev.,height=264 ]    since skiii is effectively a very weak interaction in the truncated single - particle space , there is no significant difference between the stddm and srpa results .",
    "now we discuss incoherent states which are seen in the low energy region of the strength function of the 2 phonon state with @xmath108 ( fig . [ 024 ] ) .",
    "these incoherent states have large components of the 3p-1h and 1p-3h configurations which have the same unperturbed energy as the 1p-1h configurations .",
    "since the 3p-1h , 3h-1p amplitudes and their complex conjugates are used as dynamical amplitudes in eq.([stddm1 ] ) , these incoherent states naturally appear as eigenstates .",
    "however , the important physical role played by these amplitudes seems to be a rather kinematical one . to clarify this point , we use a different expression for eq.([stddm1 ] ) @xcite . when the eigenvector @xmath109 in stddm is transformed to @xmath110 as @xmath111 eq.([stddm1 ] ) becomes @xmath112 it has been pointed out @xcite that this form of stddm is a reasonable approximation for an extended rpa with hermiticity @xcite .",
    "the kinematical effects of ground - state correlations are included in the hamiltonian matrix of eq.([erpa4 ] ) .",
    "for example , the increase of the unperturbed energy of 1 phonon states due to ground - state correlations is given by @xmath113 in @xmath114 , whereas @xmath115 describes the renormalization of the rpa matrix due to the change in occupation factors .",
    "omitting the 3p-1h and 3h-1p amplitudes and their complex conjugates in @xmath116 , we can avoid dynamical contributions of these amplitudes .",
    "this modified stddm is referred to as mstddm .",
    "the obtained results for the 1 phonon state and the 2 phonon state with @xmath108 are shown with thin dotted lines in figs.[mstddm1 ] and [ mstddm2 ] , respectively .",
    "the coherent states are little affected by the omission of the 3p-1h and 3h-1p amplitudes and their complex conjugates , and the incoherent states seen in the 2 phonon state can be eliminated .",
    "thus it would be better to use eq.([erpa4 ] ) without the 3p-1h and 3h-1p type amplitudes instead of using eq.([stddm1 ] ) with full two - body amplitudes when we are interested in the calculation of the strength functions .",
    "however , we also found that the omission of the the 3p-1h and 3h-1p type amplitudes affects the transition probability between excited states when it is evaluated using eq.([trans ] ) .",

    "the inclusion of the terms in eq.([3-body ] ) somewhat affects the properties of the 2 phonon states as expected : the excitation energies are increased by @xmath130 mev and the transition strengths are decreased by @xmath131 % , depending on @xmath94 of the 2 phonon states . as an example the strength functions for the @xmath96 state calculated in mstddm with the terms in eq.([3-body ] ) ( solid line ) and without them ( dotted line ) are shown in fig .",
