    "molecular clouds are birthplaces of stars that form the visible backbones of galaxies . therefore , it is important to investigate the molecular gas mass , its distribution in galaxies and its physical properties to understand galaxy evolution .",
    "molecular gas in galaxies mainly consists of h@xmath11 molecules .",
    "however , h@xmath11 molecules do not radiate line emissions in cold environments such as molecular clouds whose temperature is typically a few tens k , since h@xmath11 is a homonuclear diatomic molecule ( i.e. , no dipole moment ) .",
    "molecular gas mass is usually estimated indirectly from observations of heteronuclear diatomic molecules such as @xmath0co and its isotopologues since they are the second most abundant molecules after h@xmath11 in the interstellar medium .",
    "therefore , @xmath0co@xmath12 line ( @xmath0co , hereafter ) has been commonly used to observe molecular gas in external galaxies as well as the galactic objects .",
    "it has been observationally shown that the @xmath0co line luminosity correlates with the molecular gas mass estimated in several different ways , such as virial techniques , dust emission , extinction mapping and gamma - ray observation ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the correlation between @xmath0co luminosity and molecular gas mass is explained theoretically under the assumptions that 1 ) molecular clouds are virialized , 2 ) the mass of clouds are dominated by h@xmath13 , 3 ) the clouds follow the size - line width relation and 4 ) they have a constant temperature ( @xcite and references therein ) . according to the observational evidence and the theoretical explanation above , the mass and distribution of molecular gas in nearby galaxies have been investigated with the observed @xmath0co maps by assuming a constant co - to - h@xmath11 conversion factor over a whole galaxy ( e.g. , bima song , @xcite ; nobeyama co atlas , @xcite , hereafter k07 ; heracles , @xcite ) .    for a more accurate estimation of the molecular gas mass ,",
    "multiple co - isotopologues should be used in a complementary manner .",
    "the mass of virialized molecular clouds can be measured with @xmath0co and the higher opacity of @xmath0co allows us to trace the molecular gas with lower densities on the order of @xmath14 @xmath15 . on the other hand ,",
    "the opacity of @xmath0co is too high to estimate the column density through the molecular cloud unlike more optically thin lines such as @xmath1co@xmath12 and c@xmath16o@xmath12 ( @xmath1co and c@xmath16o , hereafter ) .",
    "however , the line intensities of these co - isotopologues are usually much weaker than that of @xmath0co ( by factors of @xmath17 for @xmath1co and @xmath18 for c@xmath16o , respectively ) and require a lot of telescope time to be detected .",
    "therefore , @xmath1co or c@xmath16o mapping observations toward nearby galaxies have been limited to only a handful of cases @xcite .",
    "some studies have investigated the relation between the physical states of molecular gas and galactic structures such as arms and bars from the co multi - isotopologue observations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter w11 ) observed ngc  3627 in @xmath1co and showed high @xmath0co/@xmath1co intensity ratios in the bar region .",
    "they concluded that the high @xmath0co/@xmath1co ratio indicates the existence of gravitationally unbound diffuse gas as a result of the strong streaming motion in the bar region .",
    "spiral arms are also likely to affect not only the dynamics of molecular clouds but also their internal physical conditions . the molecular gas in spiral galaxies is expected to be accumulated at the arm region through galactic shocks ( e.g. @xcite ) and sheared out in interarm regions due to the differential rotation .",
    "however there are only a few studies that focus on the physical states of molecular gas in interarm regions since even the @xmath0co emission is quite weak @xcite . to understand the effects of spiral arms on the molecular clouds , it is necessary to detect emissions of co isotopologues in the first place and then investigate the physical states of molecular gas in the interarm region .",
    "the aim of this paper is to detect weak @xmath1co emission and investigate the relationship between the galactic structures and properties of molecular gas by comparing @xmath0co and @xmath1co spectra in the characteristic regions of spiral galaxies .",
    "we stacked @xmath0co and @xmath1co spectra of a nearby barred spiral galaxy , ngc  3627 obtained in previous studies ( k07 and w11 ) after shifting the velocity axis so that the zero of the @xmath1co spectra corresponds to the local mean @xmath0co velocity .",
    "this stacking method was originally proposed by @xcite where the local mean velocity of hi is adopted as the zero velocity of @xmath0co spectra in the outer region of galaxies .",
    "this allows us to improve the signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) of the spectra .",
    "then we discuss the physical properties of molecular gas in the interarm region by comparing the @xmath0co and @xmath1co spectra .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : the data and method are explained in section [ danda ] .",
    "we show the results of the stacking analysis of the @xmath0co and @xmath1co spectra in the different regions of ngc  3627 in section [ results ] .",
    "we compare the @xmath0co with @xmath1co stacked spectra in section [ analyses ] and discuss the physical properties of the molecular gas in the different regions of ngc  3627 in section [ discussion ] .",
    "finally , we summarize this study in section [ summary ] .",
    "we first summarize the data we used and the stacking method in the following sub - sections .      [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab-8 ]",
    "we obtained the averaged spectra of @xmath0co and @xmath1co in the center , bar , bar - end , offset , arm and interarm regions of ngc  3627 with the stacking analysis after the velocity - axis alignment ( va ) procedure according to the velocity field estimated from the @xmath0co mapping data .",
    "the @xmath1co spectrum in the interarm region of ngc  3627 where the emission does not have enough s / n in the original data was successfully detected .",
    "main results of this paper are as follows :    1 .   a weak @xmath1co emission in the interarm region of ngc  3627 is successfully detected for the first time with the stacking analysis after the va procedure ( figure [ fig : stackedspectra ] of section [ results ] ) .",
    "the validity of the stacking method with va is confirmed by comparing the integrated intensity between stacked spectra with and without the va procedure .",
    "moreover , the s / n of stacked spectra with va is improved by a factor of up to 3.2 compared to those without va ( table [ tab-2 ] of section [ results ] ) .",
    "the integrated intensity ratios @xmath2 in the bar and interarm regions are almost two times higher than those in the other regions . @xmath2 in the center region is the intermediate value between them .",
    "high values of @xmath2 in the bar and center regions are attributed to the higher intensity ratios ( @xmath19 ) and one in the interarm regions is attributed to the higher fwhm@xmath5fwhm@xmath6 ratio than the other regions .",
    "the difference in the line width between @xmath0co and @xmath1co suggests two gas components , one with a narrow ( @xmath8 fwhm@xmath9 ) and the other with a broad line width ( @xmath8 fwhm@xmath10 ) in the interarm region ( tables [ tab-4 ] and [ tab-5 ] of section [ subsec - discussion2 ] ) .",
    "4 .   @xmath19 in the center and bar regions and of the broad line width components in the interarm region are @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 indicating that the @xmath0co lines are not completely optically thick in those regions if we assume the same @xmath0c/@xmath1c radial gradient as that of our galaxy ( figures [ fig : spectracomparison1213 ] , [ fig : spectracomparison1213interarm ] and [ fig : tau12co ] of sections [ subsec : slope ] and [ subsec : physicalstate ] ) .",
    "than half of the @xmath0co emission from the interarm region is likely to be radiated from the diffuse gas component , if the @xmath0co spectra is decomposed with two gaussians , one with fwhm@xmath6 and the other with @xmath8 fwhm@xmath7 ( figure [ fig : dualgaussians ] of section [ subsec : conversionfactor ] ) .",
    "the existence of non - optically thick component of @xmath0co in the center , bar , and interarm regions indicates a lower co - to - h@xmath11 conversion factor compared to the other regions .",
    "it is necessary to take into account the non - universal conversion factor in a galaxy in case of comparing the molecular gas distribution and sfe in the different regions .",
    "otherwise , the molecular gas mass and sfe may be respectively overestimated and underestimated by factors of a few in case of the interarm region of ngc  3627 ( section [ subsec : conversionfactor ] ) .",
