    "in the analysis of contingency tables , computing conditional @xmath0 values by a markov chain monte carlo method is one of the common approaches to evaluate a fitting of a statistical model to given data . in this method ,",
    "a key notion is a _ markov basis _ that guarantees the connectivity of the chain for unbiasedness of the estimation . in diaconis and sturmfels ( @xcite ) ,",
    "a notion of a markov basis is presented with algebraic algorithms to compute it .",
    "this first work is based on a discovery of the relation between a markov basis and a set of binomial generators of a toric ideal of a polynomial ring , which is the first connection between commutative algebra and statistics .",
    "after this first paper , markov bases are studied intensively by many researchers both in the fields of commutative algebra and statistics , which yields an attractive new field called _ computational algebraic statistics_. see @xcite for the first textbook of this field , and @xcite for various theoretical results and examples on markov bases .    in the analysis of contingency tables , a two - way contingency table is the most fundamental object .",
    "the first result on the markov bases in the setting of two - way contingency tables is a markov basis for the independence model . for two - way contingency tables with fixed row sums and column sums , which is the minimal sufficient statistics under the independence model ,",
    "the set of square - free moves of degree @xmath1 forms a markov basis .",
    "this result is generalized to the decomposable models of higher dimensional contingency tables by @xcite .",
    "reader can find various results on the structure of markov bases of decomposable models in chapter 8 of @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is known that the structure of a markov basis becomes complicated under various additional constraints to the two - way setting .",
    "one of such cases is the _ incomplete two - way contingency table _ ,",
    "i.e. , a contingency table with _ structural zeros _ , considered in @xcite .",
    "another case is the _ subtable sum problem _ considered in @xcite and @xcite . in these works , it is shown that the moves of higher degrees are needed for markov bases .",
    "the problem we consider in this paper is two - way contingency tables with both structural zeros and subtable sum constraints .",
    "we consider the two - way contingency tables with specific types of structural zeros called _ ladder determinantal tables _",
    ", with specific types of subtable sums called _ two - way change - point model_. the two - way change - point model is considered in @xcite for exponential families , including the poisson distribution for complete two - way contingency tables .",
    "we also consider the poisson distribution and two - way change - point model for incomplete cases in this paper .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that a markov basis for this setting is constructed as the set of square - free degree @xmath1 moves .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we illustrate the markov chain monte carlo methods for subtable sum problem of incomplete two - way contingency tables and the two - way change - point models of ladder determinant tables . in section 3 , we give the structure of the minimal markov bases for our problems , which is the main result of this paper .",
    "the arguments and the proof of our main theorem are based on the theory of grbner bases for distributive lattice , which is summarized in appendix . a numerical example for actual data is given in section 4 .",
    "first we illustrate the markov chain monte carlo methods for subtable sum problem of incomplete two - way contingency tables .",
    "though we only consider the two - way change - point model in this paper , we describe the methods in the setting of general subtable sum problems considered in @xcite .",
    "note that a specification of the subtable reduces to the two - way change - point model .",
    "let @xmath2 be the set of nonnegative integers . to consider @xmath3 contingency tables with structural zeros ,",
    "let @xmath4 be the set of cells that are not structural zeros .",
    "let @xmath5 be the number of the cells .",
    "let @xmath6 be an incomplete contingency table with the set of cells @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is an entry of the cell @xmath9 .",
    "similarly to the ordinary ( i.e. , complete ) two - way contingency tables , denote the row sums and column sums of @xmath10 by @xmath11 @xmath12 we assume that there are at least one @xmath9 in each row and each column .",
    "let @xmath13 a subset of @xmath7 .",
    "we also define the subtable sum @xmath14 by @xmath15 denote the set of the row sums , column sums and the subtable sum @xmath14 by an @xmath16-dimensional column vector @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the transpose .",
    "we also treat @xmath10 as a @xmath19-dimensional column vector as @xmath20 , by lexicographic ordering of the cells in @xmath7 .",
    "then the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath21 is written by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an @xmath24 matrix consisting of @xmath25 s and @xmath26 s .",
    "we call @xmath23 a _ configuration matrix_. though we specify @xmath7 and @xmath13 in section [ subsec : tables - and - models ] , we show an example here .    consider a @xmath27 incomplete contingency table with @xmath28 structural zeros as follows",

    "@xmath36 as we see in section [ subsec : tables - and - models ] , the configuration matrix considered in this paper satisfies the homogeneity assumption , i.e. , the row vector @xmath37 is in the real vector space spanned by the rows of @xmath23 .",
    "this is a natural assumption for statistical models .",
    "see lemma 4.14 of @xcite for the algebraic aspect of the homogeneity .",
    "@xmath38    to clarify the statistical meaning of the configuration matrix @xmath23 and the relation ( [ eqn : ax = t ] ) , consider the cell probability @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is called a @xmath41-dimensional probability simplex , and @xmath42 is the set of nonnegative real numbers .",
    "the probability simplex @xmath43 is a statistical model called a saturated model . in statistical data analysis ,",
    "our interest is in a statistical model that is a subset of @xmath43 .",
    "the two - way change - point model we consider in this paper is written in general form by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an indicator function given by @xmath46 here the term @xmath47 represents a departure from the independence structure of the log - linear model .",
    "the model @xmath48 becomes a quasi - independence model for the cells @xmath7 by @xmath49 .",
    "the quasi - independence model is a fundamental statistical model for the incomplete contingency tables ( see chapter 5 of @xcite for detail ) .",
    "markov bases for the quasi - independence model is considered in @xcite .",

    "a common approach is to base the inference on the conditional distribution given a minimal sufficient statistics for the nuisance parameters .",
    "using this conditional distribution , the conditional @xmath0 value is defined .",
    "see @xcite or chapter 1 of @xcite for detail . for our case",

    "this is a _ markov chain monte carlo method_. see chapter 2 of @xcite or @xcite for detail .    to construct a connected markov chain over @xmath69 , one of the common approaches",
