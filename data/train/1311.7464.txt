    "it is of interest both from the fundamental aspect and a practical viewpoint to understand the nonequilibrium dynamics of a particle interacting with a spatially extended environment .",
    "the fact that this subject is deeply related to such diverse areas as condensed matter physics [ 1 ] , chemical physics [ 2 ] and biological physics [ 3 ] has attracted the attention of theoretical physicists .",
    "recent progress in experimental technique enables us to access the detailed dynamics of colloidal particles immersed in a passive or active medium in the presence of an external driving force [ 4 - 6 ] . in spite of significant theoretical and experimental efforts towards understanding these dynamics , many aspects of this problem are still unclear .    for equilibrium cases ,",
    "the langevin equation has been a powerful tool for investigating the stochastic dynamics of a particle in a homogeneous environment .",
    "the effect of the environment can be described by introducing a linear friction with memory and gaussian colored noise @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the position and momentum of the particle , respectively . here , the zero - mean gaussian noise @xmath3 satisfies the fluctuation - dissipation relation of the second kind @xmath4 the friction kernel @xmath5 reflects the dynamical properties of the environment .",
    "the validity of the langevin equation has been confirmed experimentally and theoretically for some thermal or athermal systems [ 7 - 9 ] .",
    "it is not clear whether the langevin description is applicable for the dynamics of a particle driven by an external force . in such cases , since the environment may not be in equilibrium , the friction kernel @xmath5 and the random force @xmath3 are modified from those in equilibrium .",
    "in particular there is no guarantee for the validity of the fluctuation - dissipation relation of the second kind eq .",

    "[ 10 ] and [ 11 ] the relation between the friction and the correlation of the random force is discussed for a brownian particle suspended in a nonequilibrium medium .",
    "the effective temperature is a useful ingredient to describe the violation of the fluctuation - dissipation relation for nonequilibrium states .",
    "it is defined as the ratio of the correlation function of fluctuation to the linear response function with respect to small perturbations .",
    "it is known that driven systems with two well - separated time scales , such as sheared glassy liquids , have two effective temperatures associated with each time scale [ 12 - 15 ] . in this case , the effective temperature associated with the slow time scale is identical to the kinetic temperature of a coupled hamiltonian subsystem whose reaction time is equal to the time scale [ 12 ] .",
    "a similar result is obtained for a heated nanoparticle suspended in a fluid by using a detailed molecular dynamics simulation in ref .  [ 16 ] .",
    "it is natural to expect that this relationship between the time - scale - dependent effective temperature and the kinetic temperature holds for a particle driven by an external force .",
    "the main purpose of this research is to investigate the relationship between the effective temperature and the kinetic temperature for a particle interacting with an environment by introducing a microscopic model in which the dynamics of the environment are explicitly considered .",
    "the system under study consists of a particle and an elastic medium that corresponds to a spatially extended environment .",
    "the elastic medium couples with an external heat bath of temperature @xmath6 . keeping a classical particle interacting with the lattice oscillation of a crystalline solid in mind , we propose the simplest model for describing the motion of the particle . for this model",
    ", we derive an effective langevin equation by eliminating the degrees of freedom of the environment .",
    "the nonlinear interaction leads to a friction kernel @xmath5 and a non - gaussian random force @xmath3 that explicitly depend on an external force in contrast to the ordinary langevin formulation . using the effective langevin equation",
    ", we calculate the kinetic temperature @xmath7 in nonequilibrium steady states ( nesss ) driven by a constant external force .",
    "the time scale dependent effective temperature @xmath8 is also calculated from the correlation function of the velocity fluctuation and the linear response function . as a result , it is shown that the effective temperature associated with the time scale of the particle is identical to the kinetic temperature if the time scale of the environment @xmath9 and that of the particle @xmath10 are well separated .",
    "remarkably , we found that the kinetic temperature @xmath7 is not equal to the external heat bath temperature @xmath6 even in the limit @xmath11 , where the environment is expected to behave as an ideal heat bath .",

    "<S> we investigate a novel type of langevin model that describes the nonequilibrium dynamics of a classical particle interacting with a spatially extended environment . in this model , a particle , which interacts with the environment through the nonlinear interaction hamiltonian , </S>",
    "<S> is driven by a constant external force , and subsequently , it reaches a nontrivial nonequilibrium steady state . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an effective langevin equation for the particle in the nonequilibrium steady states . using this equation </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the effective temperature defined as the ratio of the correlation function of the velocity fluctuation to the linear response function with respect to a small perturbation . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that the effective temperature associated with the time scale of the particle is identical to the kinetic temperature if the time scale of the environment and that of the particle are well separated . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a noteworthy expression , which relates the kinetic temperature with the curvature of the driving force - mean velocity curve , is derived . </S>"
