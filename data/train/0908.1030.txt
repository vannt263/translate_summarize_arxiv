    "entanglement is one of the fundamental features of quantum mechanics and has led to the development of new areas of research , such as quantum information and quantum computing .",
    "some reviews and recent results on entanglement entropy in many - body systems , conformal field theory and black hole physics can be found in @xcite .",
    "einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) proposed a thought experiment @xcite to prove that quantum mechanics predicts the existence of `` spooky '' nonlocal correlations between spatially separate parts of a quantum system , a phenomenon that schrdinger @xcite called _",
    "entanglement_. afterward , bell @xcite derived some inequalities that can be violated in quantum mechanics but must be satisfied by any local hidden variable model .",
    "it was aspect @xcite who first verified in laboratory that the epr experiment , in the version proposed by bohm @xcite , violates bell inequalities , showing therefore that quantum entanglement and nonlocality are correct predictions of quantum mechanics .",
    "a renewed interest in entanglement came from black hole physics : as suggested in @xcite , black hole entropy can be interpreted in terms of quantum entanglement , since the horizon of a black hole divides spacetime into two subsystems , such that observers outside can not communicate the results of their measurements to observers inside , and vice versa .",
    "black hole entanglement entropy turns out to scale with the area @xmath0 of the event horizon , in accordance with the renowned bekenstein - hawking formula @xcite : @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the black hole entropy and @xmath3 is the planck length .",
    "let us consider a spherically symmetric quantum system , composed of two regions @xmath4 and @xmath5 separated by a spherical surface of radius @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ regions ] ) .",
    "the entanglement entropy of each part obeys an `` area law '' , as discussed e.g. in @xcite for many - body systems .",
    "this result can be justified by means of a simple argument proposed by srednicki in @xcite .",
    "if we trace over the field degrees of freedom located in region @xmath5 , the resulting density matrix @xmath7 depends only on the degrees of freedom inside the sphere , and the associated von neumann entropy is @xmath8 .",
    "if then we trace over the degrees of freedom in region @xmath4 , we obtain an entropy @xmath9 which depends only on the degrees of freedom outside the sphere .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath10 , therefore the entropy @xmath11 should depend only on properties shared by the two regions inside and outside the sphere .",
    "the only feature they have in common is their boundary , so it is reasonable to expect that @xmath11 depends only on the area of the boundary , @xmath12 .",
    "the area scaling of entanglement entropy has been investigated much more in the context of quantum field theory than in quantum mechanics . in order to bridge the gap ,",
    "in this paper we study the entanglement entropy of a quantum system composed of two separate parts ( fig .",
    "[ regions ] ) , described by a wave function @xmath13 , which we assume invariant under scale transformations and vanishing exponentially at infinity . in section [ results ] we will show that the entropy @xmath11 of both parts of our system is bounded by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a numerical constant related to the dimensionless parameter @xmath16 appearing in the wave function @xmath13 .",
    "this result , obtained at the leading order in @xmath16 , is in accordance with the so - called _ holographic bound _ on the entropy @xmath11 of an arbitrary system @xcite : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the area of any surface enclosing the system .    in section [ general ]",
    "we present the main features of our approach , focusing in particular on the properties of entanglement entropy and on the form of the wave function describing the system . in section [ results ]",
    "we calculate analytically the bound on entanglement entropy . in section [ end ] we summarize both the limits and the goals of our approach .",
    "let us suppose that a quantum system consists of two parts , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which have previously been in contact but are no longer interacting .",
    "the variables @xmath19 , @xmath20 describing the system are subjected to the following constraints ( see fig .",
    "[ regions ] ) : @xmath21 where @xmath6 is the radius of the spherical surface separating the two regions .",
    "it is convenient to introduce two dimensionless variables @xmath22 subjected to the constraints @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    in the following",
    "we will assume that the system is spherically symmetric , in order to treat the problem as one - dimensional in each region @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with all physical properties depending only on the radial distance from the origin .",
    "let @xmath25 be a generic wave function describing the system in fig .",
    "[ regions ] , composed of two parts @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    as",
    "discussed e.g. in @xcite , we can provide a description of all mesauraments in region @xmath4 through the so - called _ density matrix _",
    "@xmath26 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is related to the volume element @xmath29 in @xmath5 through the relation @xmath30 , with @xmath31 in spherical coordinates .",
    "similarly , experiments performed in @xmath5 are described by the density matrix @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is related to the volume element @xmath35 in @xmath4 through the relation @xmath36 , with @xmath37 in spherical coordinates .",
    "notice that @xmath7 is calculated tracing out the exterior variables @xmath38 , whereas @xmath39 is evaluated tracing out the interior variables @xmath40 .",

    "@xmath42 ( hermiticity ) 3 .",
    "@xmath43 ( all eigenvalues are positive or zero ) .    when only one eigenvalue of @xmath44 is nonzero , the nonvanishing eigenvalue is equal to 1 by virtue of the trace condition on @xmath44 .",
    "this case occurs only if the wave function can be factorized into an uncorrelated product @xmath45    states that admit a wave function are called `` pure '' states , as distinct from `` mixed '' states , which are described by a density matrix .",
    "a quantitative measure of the departure from a pure state is provided by the so - called _ von neumann entropy _ @xmath46 @xmath11 is zero if and only if the wave function is an uncorrelated product .",
    "the von neumann entropy is a measure of the degree of entanglement between the two parts @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the system , therefore it is called _",
    "entanglement entropy_.    when the two subsystems @xmath4 and @xmath5 are each the complement of the other , entanglement entropy can be calculated by tracing out the variables associated to region @xmath4 or equivalently to region @xmath5 , since it turns out to be @xmath47 .      as already said , the spherical region @xmath4 in fig .",

    "in particular , we could consider a particle with mass @xmath68 and negative energy @xmath69 , in a bound state due to a central potential going to zero as @xmath65 .",
    "in this case , the asymptotic form of the schrdinger equation , in spherical coordinates , is given by @xmath70 apart from the normalization constant , @xmath63 coincides with the restriction @xmath71 of the wave function @xmath72 to the exterior region @xmath5 , as seen by an inner observer localized for instance at @xmath73 , i.e. on the boundary between the two regions : @xmath74 by comparing the asymptotic behaviour of the wave functions ( [ erre ] ) and ( [ restriction ] ) as @xmath75 , we find : @xmath76 where the planck length @xmath77 has been introduced to make the parameter @xmath78 dimensionless , without any further physical meaning in this context .",
