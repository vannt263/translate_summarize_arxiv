    "the algol - type binaries are interacting systems consisting of a hot , usually more massive , main sequence star and a cool giant or subgiant which fills its roche lobe . while these binaries should be randomly oriented , more eclipsing systems",
    "have been discovered since these systems are more easily detected through their distinct light curves . by convention",
    ", the hotter star ( associated with the deeper minimum ) is referred to as the `` primary '' and the cooler star as the `` secondary . ''",
    "the secondary is losing mass to its companion and we observe circumstellar material in the form of a gas stream , an accretion annulus , or an accretion disk .",
    "the most recent paper that summarizes our current knowledge of the algols is the work by @xcite .",
    "some recent progress in the field includes : the detection and study of the pulsation of primary stars @xcite ; evidence of the superhump phenomenon in the radio power spectrum of @xmath2 per @xcite ; the calculation and modeling of synthetic spectra @xcite ; far uv and x - ray studies @xcite ; doppler tomography of the accretion structures @xcite ; eclipse mapping @xcite ; new orbits and fundamental parameters of eclipsing systems @xcite ; hydrodynamic simulations of the mass transfer process @xcite ; a survey of h@xmath0 mass transfer structures @xcite ; and a study of the evolution of algol systems @xcite .",
    "tt hydrae ( hd97528 , hip54807 , sao179648 , @xmath3 ) is a long - period ( @xmath4 days ) algol - type eclipsing binary system which consists of a hotter b9.5 v main sequence primary and a cooler evolved k1 iii - iv secondary star which fills its roche lobe .",
    "@xcite found evidence of mass transfer in the form of an accretion disk surrounding the primary .",
    "@xcite obtained ubv photometric observations and elements of the system .",
    "these observations were re - examined by @xcite who found from photometry , spectrophotometry , and spectroscopy that @xmath5k , @xmath6 kms@xmath7 for the primary , and @xmath8k for the secondary , photometric mass ratio @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "he also estimated a distance of 193 pc to the binary . @xcite",
    "estimated @xmath11 kms@xmath7 for the secondary and suggested that the mass ratio , as well as the mass of the primary , should be slightly higher than those found by @xcite if the secondary fills its roche lobe .",
    "@xcite studied the iue spectra and concluded from the presence of fe  absorption lines that the vertical dimension of the accretion disk is significant and is at least comparable to the diameter of the primary .",
    "he estimated a distance to the system of 194 pc and pointed out that the presence of super - ionized emission lines of si , c , and nv poses a question about the ionization source .",
    "@xcite estimated from the eclipses of the h@xmath0 emission region that a fairly symmetrical disk fills up to 95% of the roche lobe radius .",
    "moreover , she argued that the disk must be rather flat with the vertical dimension comparable to or less than the diameter of the primary .",
    "the depth of the h@xmath0 core was found to be strongly variable with phase and was deepest shortly before and after the primary eclipse , a feature also observed in other algols ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite determined the orbital parameters of the primary and identified a highly eccentric orbit from the ca  k and h lines .",
    "@xcite measured a few radial velocities of the primary and secondary .",
    "@xcite measured radial velocities of the primary and secondary and found that the radial velocities of the secondary were consistent with a circular orbit ( @xmath12 kms@xmath7 ) but this was not true in the case of the primary .",
    "the radial velocities of the primary suggested a mass ratio of about @xmath13 , which is not in very good agreement with the photometric value .",
    "@xcite reanalyzed the light and velocity curves separately and simultaneously and used a physical model to obtain the following parameters : separation @xmath14 , effective temperature of the primary @xmath15k , secondary @xmath16k , radius of the primary @xmath17 , secondary @xmath18 , mass of the primary @xmath19 , secondary @xmath20 , and mass ratio @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite reanalyzed the original @xcite data using the wilson - devinney code @xcite and obtained a photometric mass ratio of @xmath22 = 0.2963 , which is very close to the spectroscopic value derived by @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained the first doppler tomogram of tt hya and produced an indirect image of the accretion disk .",
    "@xcite observed redshifted absorption in ni , nlines in their fuv spectra at the phase 0.95 and interpreted it as evidence of the gas stream ; consequently they were able to infer that the rate of inflow was greater than @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite studied the h@xmath0 difference profiles and properties of the accretion region and placed tt hya in the context of other algol binaries .",
    "most recently , @xcite produced synthetic h@xmath0 spectra , compared the synthetic and observed profiles , determined the physical properties of the disk , and found evidence of the gas stream in these profiles .",
    "they also suggested the presence of an additional circumstellar structure between the c1 and c2 lagrangian surfaces , in the vicinity of the secondary star , to explain the strong h@xmath0 line cores and other effects .    in this work",
    ", we have re - examined the earlier conclusions by analyzing previously unpublished h@xmath0 spectra of tt hya .",
    "these observations are described in  2 . in  3 , we describe the study of the optical spectra , the redetermination of orbital elements and absolute dimensions of the system from new velocity curves , and the study of the radial velocities of the profiles .",

    "4 , archival high resolution ultraviolet spectra were used to provide a consistent model for the accretion structures in tt hya . in  5 , we show how doppler tomography was used to study the accretion structures in the binary and as a tool to examine the quality of the fits between the observed and synthetic spectra .",
    "finally , the conclusions are presented in  6 .",
    "the 119 optical spectra described in this work were obtained by various observers from 1985 to 2001 ( see table [ t1 ] ) .",
    "all spectra were collected with the 0.9 m coud feed telescope at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) .",
    "these spectra have a resolution of 0.34   and dispersion at h@xmath0 of @xmath247.0   mm@xmath7 .",
    "the data can be separated roughly into two major groups : 1985 feb  1991 mar ( group 1 ) and 1994 apr - 2001 jan ( group 2 ) .",
    "in addition , we used the original 27 radial velocity measurements of @xcite based on spectra collected from 1956 - 1977 at mt .",
    "wilson and lick observatories at a resolution of 1120  / mm ( see table [ t1 ] ) .",
    "the ut dates , hjd , and epochs of the kpno data are listed in the first three columns of table [ t2 ] .",
    "the ultraviolet spectra of tt hya were obtained with the iue telescope from 1980 to 1992 . the short wavelength range ( 1150  ",
    "1950 ) was covered by the swp camera while the long wavelength range ( 1900  ",
    "3200 ) was covered by the lwp and lwr cameras @xcite .",
    "the high resolution iue spectra have a resolution of 0.1  to 0.3  or r=10000 .",
    "only the high resolution spectra are studied here since the low resolution spectra are not suitable for radial velocity studies . moreover , these high resolution iue spectra are similar in resolution to the optical spectra .",
    "six long wavelength ( lwp and lwr ) spectra and eleven short wavelength ( swp ) spectra were analyzed .",
    "these data are summarized in table [ t3 ] .",
    "the photometric phases , @xmath25 , were calculated by assuming the photometric period , @xmath26 @xcite and the ephemeris of primary minimum , @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "@xmath28 in tables 2 and 3 , hjd is the heliocentric julian date , and epoch.phase is the whole number epoch with the photometric phase , @xmath25 , listed after the decimal point .",
    "the phase coverage of the spectra is illustrated in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "this section describes the analysis of the optical spectra . in  3.1 , we derive precise orbital elements and improve the values for the absolute dimensions of the system based on a new velocity curve for the secondary . in  3.2 , we discuss the central absorption of the h@xmath0 line which is most closely associated with the primary star . in  3.3 , we describe the calculation of synthetic h@xmath0 spectra with the new code called @xcite .",
    "model spectra were calculated for the stars , accretion disk , and gas stream .",
    "these synthetic spectra were compared with the observed spectra and both were later used to make reconstructed images of the accretion structures in the binary ( see  5 ) .",
    "the spectral lines of the secondary are seen more clearly in our optical spectra because they are much sharper than the lines of the primary .",
    "they are more accurate tracers of the orbital motion than the lines of the primary , which are highly broadened by the stellar rotation and distorted by the presence of the accretion disk .",
    "hence , orbital elements based on the lines of the primary are not as precise as those derived from the lines of the secondary .",
    "the radial velocities were determined using the cross - correlation technique and a template based on synthetic spectra was created for this procedure .",
    "first , the model atmosphere of the secondary star was obtained by interpolating in the @xcite -  grid and assuming solar abundances and a microturbulence of 2 kms@xmath7 .",
    "next , the intrinsic synthetic stellar spectrum of the secondary emerging from this atmospheric model ( flux per unit surface area ) was calculated using the code called @xcite , as modified by @xcite . here",
    "again , solar abundances and a microturbulence of 2 kms@xmath7 were assumed .",
    "the synthetic spectrum was then convolved with the rotational ( @xmath29 kms@xmath7 ; @xcite ) and instrumental profiles .",
    "subsequently , this synthetic spectrum was diluted with the featureless continuum of the primary assuming a known l1/l2 ratio , where l1 and l2 are the luminosities corresponding to the h@xmath0 continuum of the primary and secondary , respectively .",
    "this diluted spectrum was then used as a template for the radial velocity measurements .",
    "the radial velocities of the secondary star were measured using the cross - correlation of the observed spectra with this template synthetic spectrum , omitting the region near h@xmath0 .",
    "six spectra at phases 3092.942 , 3096.962 , 3097.371 , 3669.771 , 3669.784 , and 3737.902 were excluded from the measurements due to either a low s / n or heavy blending by terrestrial lines , hence a total of 113 highly reliable radial velocity measurements of the secondary star were obtained .",
    "these are listed under @xmath30 in column 8 of table [ t2 ] .",
    "our measurements have more than quadrupled the previous number of radial velocity measurements of the secondary since popper s work .",
    "moreover , the much improved precision and phase coverage allowed us to examine whether algol - type binaries might have non - circular orbits .",
    "the derivation of orbital elements for tt hya was performed using the code of @xcite .",
    "table [ t4 ] lists the resulting orbital elements : systemic velocity , @xmath31 ; velocity semi - amplitude , @xmath32 ; orbital eccentricity , @xmath33 ; longitude of periastron , @xmath34 ; epoch of the periastron , @xmath35 ; orbital period , @xmath36 ; mass function , @xmath37 ; semi - major axis , @xmath38 ; and standard deviation of the fit , @xmath39 .",
    "first , the original 27 radial velocity measurements of @xcite from 1956  1977 were reanalyzed and a mean standard deviation , @xmath40 kms@xmath7 was obtained .",
    "next , we analyzed our kpno data in three groups by date : 19851991 , 1994 - 2001 , and 19852001 and found solutions with @xmath41 kms@xmath7 , @xmath42 kms@xmath7 , and @xmath43 kms@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "finally , we combined our data with those of @xcite to obtain a data set of 140 measurements over an extended baseline of 45 years .",
    "the measurements were weighted according to the inverse square of their standard deviation , which resulted in weights of 0.15 for the 19561977 data from @xcite , 0.21 for the 1985 - 1991 data and 1.0 for the 1994 - 2001 data . since the precision of the photometric period of the @xcite was uncertain , we calculated four velocity curve solutions .",
    "the orbital period was fixed at the value published by @xcite for the analysis of the ( 1 ) 19942001 data , ( 2 ) 19852001 data , and ( 3 ) the complete dataset from 19562001 which included popper s measurements ( see table [ t4 ] , columns 2  4 ) . in the final case ,",
    "the 19562001 data were analyzed with the period as a free parameter within ( table [ t4 ] , column 5 ) .",
    "the elements derived from column 5 of table [ t4 ] were used to calculate the ( o - c ) and spectroscopic phases listed in table [ t2 ] .",
    "the differences in the orbital elements listed in table [ t4 ] are very small .",
    "the orbital solution derived from our most accurate data ( 19942001 data ; column 2 ) , is to be preferred .",
    "however , the results listed in column 5 provide the best orbit based entirely on spectroscopic data .",
    "we note that the orbital period of 6.953429 days derived by @xcite is well outside the error bars of the new spectroscopic solution of @xmath44 days .",
    "this spectroscopic orbital solution and radial velocity measurements are illustrated in figure [ f2 ] , and the ( o - c ) residuals are shown in figure [ f3 ] .",
    "figure [ f3 ] shows that popper s measurements @xcite tend to smooth the amplitude of the radial velocity curve at the quadratures .    assuming @xmath45 km from the solution in table [ t4 ] column 2 based on the high - accuracy 19942001 data and an inclination and mass ratio from @xcite , we obtain @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the stellar masses were computed directly from the derived semi - major axis using kepler s third law , assuming a known mass ratio . however , since @xcite found that @xmath48 , we calculated improved stellar radii by rescaling the @xcite radii by a factor of 23.04/22.63 or 1.018 .",
    "this simple scaling of the system dimensions is necessitated by the absence of adequate new photometry , especially at red or near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "moreover , we hope that new simultaneous light curve and velocity curve solutions will be completed to further improve the parameters of this system .",
    "the new radii and other derived system parameters are listed in table [ t5 ] . here , the first column labeled `` vw '' lists the results from table 4b of @xcite , while the second column gives our improved values .",
    "if we assume that @xmath49 @xcite , where r is the radius of the primary in @xmath50 and d is the distance to the system in kpc , then we obtain a new distance @xmath51pc to tt hya . this new value is still not in good agreement with the hipparcos distance of 154 pc .",
    "this means that either the hipparchos parallax was overestimated or the temperature of 9900 k assumed by @xcite was overestimated , i.e. , his value of @xmath52 was underestimated .",
    "table [ t4 ] also shows that the eccentricity differs from zero by more than 7@xmath39 and the standard deviation of the best photometric fit is 2.0 kms@xmath7 , a significant improvement over the previous eccentricity and circular orbit derived by @xcite . an eccentric orbit for",
    "the secondary star could imply that the mass transfer process may not be uniform .",
    "based on our analysis of the spectra , this process could be intensified at periastron , when the roche lobe shrinks , and attenuated at apastron .",
    "assuming that more material is released at periastron ( photometric phase , @xmath53 ) than at apastron , and that it takes time for this material to interact with the disk , get heated , and become luminous , then enhanced h@xmath0 emission should be detected with the stronger blue peak at the phases shortly after @xmath54 .",
    "evidence of such enhanced emission was found at phases @xmath55 ( see @xcite , figure 6 ) ; consequently enhanced emission near periastron is a viable possibility .",
    "similar observations in other algol - type binaries with non - zero eccentricities would provide stronger evidence of the association with periastron .",
    "moreover , these results may explain the rz cas system in which intensified pulsations of the primary star are strongest shortly after primary eclipse @xcite , which occurs near periastron .",
    "the h@xmath0 line has a complicated shape because it contains double peaked emission with a central absorption .",
    "table [ t2 ] lists our measurements of the normalized fluxes of the blue and red emission peaks ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) and the central absorption ( @xmath58 ) , as well as the radial velocity measurements of the central absorption ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the central absorption ( or depression ) in the h@xmath0 line profile is the strongest feature in our spectra that can be ascribed ( at least partly ) to the primary star .",
    "the radial velocity of the h@xmath0 line core , @xmath59 , is shown in figure [ f4 ] .",
    "these measurements reflect the motion of the primary star but are distorted by several effects at different phases . near first quadrature ( phase , @xmath60 ) ,",
    "the spectrum shows blueshifted absorption .",
    "closer to secondary eclipse ( @xmath61 ) , we do not observe any significant negative velocities and thus can not confirm previous suggestions of mass outflow at these phases @xcite .",
    "the opposite quadrature from @xmath62 has somewhat higher redshifted velocities since the gas stream and disk which project onto the primary star surface have a considerable radial , in - falling component of the velocity .",
    "near primary eclipse the velocities of the central h@xmath0 absorption differ greatly from those predicted by the orbital motion of the primary .",
    "it might be expected that the gradual occultation of the rapidly rotating primary would considerably affect the measured radial velocities ; however , this rotational effect can only operate within the partial eclipse from @xmath63 and the velocity curve is distorted over a much broader interval from @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , the rotational effect would predict positive velocities from @xmath65 and negative velocities from @xmath66 , while the opposite trend is observed .",
    "another explanation of this effect is thus necessary .",
    "the eclipse of the approaching edge of the disk from @xmath67 removes the blueshifted emission peak , which should manifest as blueshifted absorption in the observed h@xmath0 profile ( with an opposite effect for @xmath68 ) .",
    "this phenomenon influences the broad shape of the h@xmath0 core but is not the predominant cause of the anomalous radial velocity measurements near primary eclipse .",
    "it is the secondary star which is mainly responsible for the effect .",
    "although its intrinsic h@xmath0 line is rather weak , it is narrow and can considerably affect the radial velocity measurements of the center of h@xmath0 absorption , particularly at the phases when both components of h@xmath0 ( from the primary and secondary ) are aligned and become unresolved . at these phases ,",
    "the secondary component of h@xmath0 determines the deepest point of the whole h@xmath0 feature which was used in radial velocity measurements .",
    "the measurements of h@xmath0 absorption near primary eclipse are in excellent agreement with the velocity curve of the secondary , and similar measurements performed on the synthetic spectra of the stars plus disk also reveal a transition near primary eclipse where the h@xmath0 absorption ceases to follow the velocity curve of the primary and instead matches that of the secondary . a qualitatively similar effect is observed near secondary eclipse , although in this case the amplitude of the measured radial velocities is slightly less than predicted by the secondary velocity curve , presumably a result of the partial obscuration of the secondary .",
    "future radial velocity measurements of the primary from weaker lines in the infrared as well as r - band and infrared photometry ( see e.g. , @xcite ) might improve the parameters of the system considerably , specifically the mass ratio and the temperature of the secondary star .      the variability of the h@xmath0 line profile with epoch is illustrated in figure [ f5 ] for phases near @xmath25 = 0.08 , 0.19 , 0.23 , 0.33 , 0.37 , 0.54 , 0.67 , 0.81 , and 0.96 .",
    "this figure shows that the spectra obtained in 1994 apr ( epoch 3570 ) had significantly stronger disk emission than the other spectra .",
    "the emission strength returned to normal by 1994 jun ( epoch 3579 ) .",
    "the three major characteristics of the complicated h@xmath0 profile : red emission , blue emission , central absorption ( @xmath57 , @xmath56 , @xmath58 ) can be plotted as a function of phase , @xmath25 , in what we call a `` rebeca '' diagram .",
    "@xcite [ brm05 ] illustrated how various structures could be identified in this diagram ( see figure 6 of brm05 ) .",
    "we have revised their figure to include all tt hya spectra from 19852001 ( see fig .",
    "phases @xmath69 show comparable intensity in the blue - red emission peaks , while the red emission is slightly stronger at @xmath70 .",
    "brm05 speculated that such an effect , if accompanied by the reverse ( blue emission stronger ) during the mirror phases ( @xmath71 ) , could indicate the presence of circumstellar matter in the vicinity of the secondary star between the c1-c2 surfaces .",
    "the new 19852001 observations at @xmath70 confirm that the red emissions is stronger while at @xmath71 the blue emission is stronger .",
    "however , the above mentioned idea of brm05 probably can not explain the effect since it would require a circumstellar matter between c1-c2 surfaces projecting onto the surface of the secondary with a considerable outflowing velocity component ( relative to the secondary star ) at @xmath70 and inflowing velocity component during @xmath71 which seems unlikely . at @xmath72 ,",
    "the blue emission is stronger than the red emission and both emissions increase slightly . according to brm05 ,",
    "this is caused by the extra absorption of the secondary s light in the receding part of the disk and by the eclipse of the secondary star .",
    "the calculations of brm05 predicted that the reverse should be seen during the mirror phases ( @xmath73 ) . our new observations from 1985",
    "2001 strongly confirm the presence of this effect .",
    "the central absorption gets progressively deeper when approaching the secondary eclipse as described in brm05 .",
    "the blue and red emission seen during @xmath74 seem fairly symmetric .",
    "starting at about @xmath75 , all three parameters ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) , ( @xmath58 ) change dramatically . the blue emission decreases rapidly due to the eclipse of the disk while the red emission gets slightly stronger . at about @xmath76 ,",
    "both emissions soar as we go into total eclipse and the reverse effects are observed during @xmath77 .",
    "this behavior was explained by brm05 , however , the blue emission at about phase 0.02 seems surprisingly strong .",
    "the `` w '' shape of the central absorption pattern near primary eclipse , from @xmath78 , was qualitatively explained by the calculations of brm05 .",
    "in addition , they suggested the presence of cooler circumstellar matter around the secondary star which would produce an excess absorption in the core of h@xmath0 at these phases . using oi @xmath797774 spectroscopy",
    ", @xcite identified similar interesting effects of disks and streams in several algols around or near both eclipses .",
    "we anticipate that synthetic spectra generated from the output of hydrodynamic simulations may more clearly explain the `` w '' behavior of the central absorption at these eclipse phases .      the behavior of the line shape was studied in detail by brm05 . in that paper , we showed that the emission peaks originated from the disk and that both the emission and central absorption varied with phase .",
    "in addition , we proposed a quantitative empirical model of the disk which could account for the behavior of the observed h@xmath0 line profiles .",
    "however , brm05 found that there remained a difference between the observed and synthetic spectra which could be improved if the primary star was assigned a lower effective gravity than derived earlier and the gas stream was considered in the calculations . in this paper , we have recalculated the synthetic spectra by including the gas stream as well as the stars and accretion disk in the model .",
    "these changes improved the fits between the observed and synthetic spectra at all phases outside of primary eclipse , @xmath80 ( see fig .",
    "[ f7 ] ) , while having almost no effect on the primary eclipse spectra .",
    "the code @xcite was used to calculate the new intrinsic ( not rotationally broadened ) spectrum of the primary assuming a lower surface gravity of @xmath81 , microturbulence of @xmath82 kms@xmath7 , solar abundances , as well as kurucz models and line lists @xcite .",
    "the synthetic spectrum of the secondary was based on the parameters used in @xcite .",
    "new composite synthetic spectra of the stars , disk , and gas stream , were calculated using the code @xcite , for phases corresponding to the observations .",
    "the gas stream was treated as a simple cylinder located along the predicted freefall path with approximately freefall velocities . since the disk extends almost to the roche lobe and",
    "has a thickness of @xmath83 above ( and below ) the orbital plane , the radius of the stream cylinder was set to @xmath84 to produce an overlap between the gas stream and disk locations .",
    "this overlap permitted the stream to flow through only above and below the disk .",
    "the density , temperature and velocity field of the disk were assigned a higher priority than the gas stream in the overlap region .",
    "initially , a gas stream temperature of @xmath85k was chosen to correspond to the peak in h@xmath0 emissivity .",
    "the estimated density of the stream at the starting point ( @xmath86g@xmath87 ) was chosen to improve the fit between the observed and synthetic emission at the quadratures of the orbit and during the eclipses .",
    "for these calculations , the density was allowed to vary along the stream to satisfy the continuity equation .",
    "the density of the disk at the inner radius was @xmath88g@xmath87 and the temperature of the disk was @xmath89k .",
    "note that this density derived from the h@xmath0 line is very close to the value of @xmath90g@xmath87 obtained from the iue spectra ( see  4 and table [ t6 ] ) , but the iue solution produced a better fit to the data . the electron number densities in the disk and stream were calculated from the temperature , density , and chemical composition using the newton - raphson linearization method .",
    "all the other parameters of the system were the same as in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "the comparison between the observed and synthetic spectra in figure [ f7 ] demonstrates that the inclusion of the gas stream in the synthetic spectra slightly improves the fit between observation and theory , particularly near the quadratures .",
    "the mass transfer rate can be estimated from the velocity , density , and cross - section ( the two semicircular sectors ) of the gas stream above and below the disk .",
    "we obtained a rate of @xmath91 , two orders of magnitude higher than the lower limit of @xmath23 obtained by @xcite .",
    "since the temperature of the stream was chosen to correspond to the peak h@xmath0 emissivity , our value of the mass transfer rate is still a lower limit .",
    "this rate depends essentially on the equivalent width of the excess emission corresponding to the stream , i.e. , on the stream temperature and density , but not significantly on any particular choice of stream geometry .",
    "the ultraviolet spectra of tt hya analyzed in this work were derived from iue spectra collected from 1980 - 1992 ( see  2 ) .",
    "a few of these spectra were studied by @xcite , but his analysis focussed on the low resolution spectra and included only two out - of - eclipse high resolution iue spectra . since that time",
    ", seventeen high resolution spectra were obtained with the iue telescope , including two during total eclipse .",
    "these data are summarized in table [ t3 ] .",
    "only the high resolution spectra have been analyzed in this work since the low resolution spectra are not suitable for our radial velocity studies .      in the optical spectra , there are very few absorption lines of the primary and these are often heavily distorted and contaminated by emission features .",
    "however , the ultraviolet lines can be used to measure radial velocities , which are crucial for establishing a precise mass ratio , and thus the geometry of the system ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . for this reason ,",
    "radial velocities of the primary were measured from the high resolution iue spectra .",
    "first , we calculated the synthetic spectrum of the primary with the code @xcite .",
    "once again , kurucz models and line list , with vacuum wavelengths , were used @xcite .",
    "since the observed ultraviolet lines were narrower than expected from the rotational velocity ( @xmath92 kms@xmath7 ; table [ t6 ] ) , the synthetic spectrum was convolved with a rotation profile of 80 kms@xmath7 , to improve the accuracy of the cross correlation procedure .",
    "( note that the slightly lower rotational velocity is consistent with our later suggestion (  4.2 ) of a circumstellar origin for the uv lines . )",
    "the radial velocities were then obtained via cross - correlation of the observed and synthetic spectra .",
    "these velocities are listed in table [ t3 ] and displayed in figure [ f8 ] .",
    "qualitatively , except at phase 0.25 , the ultraviolet spectrum moves in phase with the primary star .",
    "however , quantitatively this trend does not overlap with the expected motion of the primary .",
    "@xcite suggested that the uv lines did not originate from the primary star but from the accretion disk .",
    "we confirm that they arise from a loosely - bound , cooler structure with non - circular velocities , like an elliptical accretion disk around the primary star .",
    "figure [ f8 ] can also be used to speculate on the geometry and dynamics of the disk .",
    "starting at @xmath93 , we observe the highest radial velocities corresponding to the highest infall velocities of about 40kms@xmath7 , which suggests that the `` stream''-lines in the disk are not fully circular but are influenced by the infalling gas stream .",
    "this infalling velocity component decreases as we move back in phase and disappears somewhere in the region of @xmath94 .",
    "this indicates that the streamlines are almost tangential at these phases and that the disk shape may be elliptical , with periastron at @xmath94 . at earlier phases , @xmath95",
    ", we observe velocities more negative than expected which indicates outflowing streamlines in agreement with the elliptical disk model .",
    "the only measurement which does not concur with this model is the one at @xmath96 , which was obtained during the same epoch ( 3363 ; table 2 ) as several other points in figure [ f8 ] .",
    "the ultraviolet spectrum of an algol - type binary is dominated by the light of the primary star ( except during total primary eclipse ) since the contribution from the cooler secondary star is insignificant at these wavelengths .",
    "the uv region in tt hya contains many absorption - dominated spectral lines .",
    "however , these lines do not originate from the primary star but probably from an accretion disk as suggested by @xcite based on their narrow widths and unusual depths .",
    "most of the lines in the uv spectrum are blended fe  lines which are often referred to as the `` iron curtain '' @xcite .",
    "the  iron curtain \" origin of the uv lines is confirmed by their radial velocities ( see  [ s4 ] ) which are decoupled from the velocities of the primary star .",
    "these sharp and deep absorption lines were used to derive an independent estimate of the temperature of the accretion disk .",
    "we modeled the region of the uv spectrum in the vicinity of the al@xmath791854 resonance doublet from 1850   to 1867  .",
    "the following nine spectral lines were used to derive the final model : fe  @xmath791854.659 , al  @xmath791854.716 , fe   @xmath791859.746 , fe   @xmath791860.053 , fe   @xmath791860.132 , al   @xmath791862.478 , al  @xmath791862.790 , fe   @xmath791864.647 , and fe   @xmath791864.749 .    as in the case of the optical spectra ,",
    "the synthetic spectrum of the primary star was calculated using the code @xcite .",
    "solar abundances , kurucz models and line list with vacuum wavelengths @xcite , and a microturbulence of 2 kms@xmath7 were assumed .",
    "this spectrum was then assigned to the star and a complex spectrum of the star and disk in absolute units was calculated with the code @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the primary star and disk were taken from @xcite , and our derived distance of 203 pc was assumed in the calculations .",
    "the density of the disk was also adopted from @xcite since these values were obtained from the h@xmath0 emission strength , which provides a good measure of the density .",
    "the electron number density was derived using the newton - raphson linearization and iteration method from the temperature , density , and abundances .",
    "the initial temperature of the primary star ( @xmath97k ) was previously derived from the uv continuum by @xcite . however , the temperature of the star and disk were varied to match the observed iue spectra .",
    "the best fit to the local continuum was obtained from the kurucz models for a stellar temperature @xmath98k , which is in very good agreement with the result of @xcite .",
    "the al  and fe  lines in this region are sensitive temperature indicators , and a disk temperature of @xmath89k provided the best fit to the uv lines . at cooler temperatures , the al  lines in the synthetic spectra",
    "disappear , while hotter temperatures lead to a disappearance of the fe  lines in the synthetic spectra .",
    "this new disk temperature is in good agreement with the estimate of @xmath99k found by @xcite from the h@xmath0 line .",
    "in addition , the new disk temperature is @xmath100 of the primary star , which is a common assumption in the case in be star disks and which may indicate that the be disk phenomenon may extend to the algol - type binaries .",
    "thomson scattering in the disk does not affect the spectrum significantly since the disk is optically thin in the continuum .",
    "in the center of strong lines , like the al  1854.7 line , the opacity can be 3 - 4 orders of magnitude higher than in the continuum and the optical depth can sometimes be greater than 10 . under these circumstances , the assumption of an optically thin medium in the treatment of scattering is not fulfilled within the code .",
    "however , in lte , the line source function is the planck function , thus the scattering does not affect the lines at all .",
    "table [ t6 ] summarizes the parameters of the star and disk derived from this uv region .",
    "figure [ f9 ] clearly demonstrates that the synthetic stellar spectrum of the primary can not fit the uv absorption lines .",
    "once the disk is included , a disk temperature of @xmath89k provides a better fit to the observed al  lines than a temperature of @xmath99k .",
    "a total eclipse of the primary star provides a unique opportunity to study the energy balance between the stars and circumstellar matter , the effects of various radiative processes , and the geometry of the circumstellar material .",
    "for this reason , we used to calculate the total absolute flux in the continuum and lines during total eclipse ( at @xmath101 ) in the spectral region containing the al  lines ( 1850  1867  ) .",
    "the parameters of the disk and primary star were assumed from the previous section .",
    "however , the secondary star had to be included in the calculation of the spectra seen during total primary eclipse . in the calculation of the synthetic spectra ,",
    "the secondary was considered to be a blackbody with a temperature of @xmath102k at the rotation poles .",
    "roche geometry , limb darkening , and gravity darkening were included . at @xmath103 the model based on two stars and",
    "a disk predicts a total absolute _ continuum _ flux of @xmath104 erg@xmath105s@xmath7@xmath7 .",
    "approximately one half of this flux comes from scattered light in the disk arising from the primary , while thermal radiation of the disk is negligible ( on the order of 1% ) .",
    "the continuum flux from the secondary star is comparable to that of the scattered light .",
    "figure [ f10 ] illustrates a 2d projection image of the system ( as if seen on the sky ) at mid - primary eclipse ( @xmath101 ) for wavelengths near 1850    in the continuum . in this figure , the image of the secondary star is rounded because of limb darkening , while the depression in the center of the secondary star is due to gravity darkening . the large peaks on either side of the secondary star represent the disk emission , which is mainly due to thomson scattering .",
    "the fit between the observed and synthetic spectra at mid - primary eclipse is illustrated in figure [ f11 ] .",
    "the lines that were seen in absorption outside of the eclipses become double - peaked emission lines during total eclipse . at lower resolution",
    ", these lines would become unresolved and should create a pseudo - continuum with a flux of @xmath106erg@xmath105s@xmath7@xmath7 level .",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite who determined the pseudo - continuum flux of @xmath107 erg@xmath105s@xmath7@xmath7 from low resolution iue spectra at this wavelength .",
    "however , it is clear from figure [ f11 ] that a disk with a temperature of @xmath89k can not account for the emission seen in lines of higher ions like al  during primary eclipse . a hotter emission source , with geometry and dynamics different from an accretion disk , is required to explain the observed spectra .",
    "the most important opacity source in the continuum at this phase is thomson scattering .",
    "this opacity source is typically two orders of magnitude higher than the hydrogen bound - free opacity , which is a few times higher than the rayleigh scattering on neutral hydrogen ; and the rayleigh scattering is about 2 - 3 orders of magnitude higher than the hydrogen free - free opacity .",
    "@xcite carried out spectropolarimetric observations of tt hya in the spectral region from 16002300  during total eclipse .",
    "they reported the presence of a non - stellar continuum which was considerably polarized ( 20 - 30% at the shortest wavelength ) .",
    "based on previous arguments , this continuum is a pseudo - continuum created by emission in the lines . the fact that this light is polarized indicates that the line emission is not fully thermal but that there is scattering in the lines as well .",
    "this finding suggests that the real source function in the lines is not fully a planck function and that there are departures from lte , which leads to non - lte effects .      during the total eclipse of the primary star",
    ", various emission lines of highly ionized species can be identified .",
    "@xcite could not explain the source of this ionization .",
    "figure [ f12 ] illustrates the high resolution iue spectra of the si  ( @xmath791394 , @xmath791403 ) , c  ( @xmath791548 , @xmath791551 ) , al  ( @xmath791855 , @xmath791863 ) , and mg  ( @xmath792796 , @xmath792804 ) doublets during primary eclipse .",
    "each emission line has a single - peaked profile , which suggests that this emission does not originate in a disk .",
    "the line centers ( except for mg ) are redshifted by about 100 - 200 kms@xmath7 and the line widths extend to @xmath108 kms@xmath7 from the line centers .",
    "comparison with our synthetic spectra also suggests that the disk temperature ( @xmath89k ) is too low to produce these lines .",
    "moreover , these lines can not originate on the primary or in the inner part of the disk since these regions are eclipsed at this phase .",
    "so , these highly - ionized lines must originate from a region with considerable vertical dimension above ( or below ) the orbital plane .",
    "@xcite arrived at the same conclusions based on their studies of high - to - moderate ionization emission lines in the far uv obtained with fuse .",
    "they suggested the presence of a bipolar jet to account for these features .",
    "however , their interpretation may not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed iue spectra .",
    "symmetric bipolar jets perpendicular to the orbital plane and with an orbital inclination of @xmath109 would lead to jet velocities of @xmath24 1200 kms@xmath7 .",
    "one jet would have to be occulted during the eclipse since we observe only one redshifted feature .",
    "thus the jets would have to be shorter than about 7 @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , we should expect an occulted jet to display blueshifted emission based on geometric arguments , rather than the redshifted emission that was observed .",
    "the jets would also have to be highly collimated , with opening angles @xmath110 degrees to avoid smoothing the observed redshifted emission .",
    "consequently , there are many constraints on the jet model .",
    "we propose , instead , that the emission arises from a hot disk - stream interaction region and an extended region near the impact site .",
    "this region would have a redshifted radial velocity component of the correct size during total eclipse , and would naturally have higher temperatures than the disk .",
    "the structure would also extend below and above the disk plane due to the disk - stream interaction and be turbulent with supersonic velocities .",
    "the region would be un - occulted near third contact , which would explain the behavior of ovi detected by @xcite .",
    "another interesting feature can be observed in the new high resolution hires spectra .",
    "the ly@xmath0 core is observed in emission and this emission is very sharp , with a maximum half - width of @xmath111 kms@xmath7 .",
    "figure [ f13 ] shows that the ly@xmath0 line is relatively stable during a single epoch , independent of phase ( e.g. , epoch 3363 ; figure [ f13](a ) ) .",
    "however , figures [ f13](b ) , and [ f13](c ) suggest that the @xmath112 emission can be highly variable .",
    "it can undergo a sudden enhancement , a small wavelength shift , or display an asymmetry as illustrated in figure [ f13](b ) .",
    "the spectra at epoch 3363 ( fig .",
    "[ f13](a ) ) are all very similar and slightly blueshifted relative to the center of mass of the binary , while those at epochs 2867 , 2876 , 3500 , and 3501 are nearly identical but slightly redshifted ( fig .",
    "[ f13](b ) , [ f13](c ) ) . a flare - like event or outburst occurred between epochs 2867 and 2874 , and",
    "was gone by epoch 2876 , within two orbital cycles ( fig .",
    "[ f13](b ) ) .",
    "there are several possible explanations of this ly@xmath0 line behavior : ( a ) nlte effects in the atmospheres of the stars ; ( b ) a temperature inversion in the atmospheres of the stars ; ( c ) emission originating from extended volumes of circumstellar material ; or ( d ) emission not originating in the binary system , but in earth s geocorona or in our solar system .",
    "since , the line does not move according to the orbit of either star we can reject the first two hypotheses . since the line is very sharp , any circumstellar material would have to be very far from the stars to avoid line broadening by keplerian motions .",
    "if the circumstellar structure is in the form of a shell , we can estimate the inner radius of this structure ( the distance from center of mass of binary ) to be @xmath113 by equating the keplerian velocity with the maximum half - width of the line , and assuming that the masses of the stars are @xmath114 .",
    "the maximum velocities observed during the outburst event ( fig . [ f13](b ) ) were @xmath115 kms@xmath7 measured from the red wing of the line .",
    "subsequently , the volume of gas involved in the outburst would have a radius of @xmath116 .",
    "however , more data are needed to understand the origin of these outbursts and hypothesis ( d ) provides the most likely explanation for the l@xmath0 emission .",
    "doppler tomography has been a useful tool for providing images of the complex accretion structures in the algols ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) . in this work",
    ", we have used this technique to make images of the accretion structures in the binary , in order to examine the quality of the fits between the observed and synthetic h@xmath0 spectra , and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the code in modeling selected accretion structures .",
    "the synthetic h@xmath0 spectra used in this section were described in  3.4 with the disk properties derived from the analysis of the uv spectra ( see  4.2 and table [ t6 ] ) . for these calculations",
    ", we used the newly derived mass and radius of the primary ( m = 2.77 @xmath117 , r = 1.99 @xmath118 ; see table [ t5 ] ) .",
    "the assumed disk temperature was 7000 k and the initial gas stream temperature was 8000 k. we also calculated synthetic spectra using the values derived by @xcite ( m = 2.63 @xmath117 , r = 1.95 @xmath118 ) and found that the two sets of synthetic spectra were nearly identical .",
    "as expected , the profiles are more sensitive to the temperature and density of the disk than to small changes in the stellar mass and radius .",
    "the doppler tomograms were derived from the 19852001 h@xmath0 data in several groups : ( a ) the observed spectra , ( b ) the observed spectra minus the synthetic stellar spectra , ( c ) the observed spectra minus the synthetic spectra of the stars and accretion disk , and ( d ) the observed spectra minus the synthetic spectra of the stars , disk , and gas stream .",
    "these images were derived for three data sets to illustrate the changes with time : ( 1 ) 1985  1991 , ( 2 ) 1994  2001 , and ( 3 ) the entire data set from 19852001 .",
    "the reconstructed images of the h@xmath0 accretion sources are shown in figure [ f14 ] .",
    "figure [ f14 ] ( row 1 ) shows that the observed h@xmath0 emission originated from a part of the disk structure whose outer edge was close to the roche surface of the star but whose inner edge did not touch the surface of the primary .",
    "the tomograms shown in figure [ f14 ] ( row 2 ) were based on the difference spectra when only the stars were included in the synthetic spectrum .",
    "they shows that the accretion disk dominated the emission profile once the stellar contribution was removed from the observed spectrum .",
    "when the stars and disk were all modeled in , and difference profiles were calculated , the resulting image was almost clear ( fig .",
    "[ f14 ] , row 3 ) ; however enhancement of this image showed that two structures remained : emission along the gas stream and a portion of the accretion disk ( fig .",
    "[ f14 ] , row 4 ) .",
    "finally , when the stars , disk , and gas stream were all incorporated into the synthetic profile , the tomogram showed an almost clear image once again as in ( fig .",
    "[ f14 ] , row 3 ) , but enhancement of this final image showed that the gas stream emission had disappeared , and the only structure that remained arose from the locus of the accretion disk ( fig .",
    "[ f14 ] , row 5 ) .",
    "the main difference between the 19851991 ( column 1 ) and 19942001 ( column 2 ) data sets was that the disk emission was generally stronger during the earlier epoch than in the later epoch .",
    "in addition , the phase coverage during the earlier epoch was not as good as during 19942001 , with only a few spectra between @xmath119 ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) , which explains the streaky appearance of the 19851991 images .",
    "these doppler images suggest that the code can be used to sequentially model the stars , disk , and gas stream .",
    "only a very faint portion of the disk could not be modeled .",
    "comparisons with simulated h@xmath0 tomograms of tt hya based on hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite suggested that the unmodeled region was indeed part of an asymmetric accretion disk .",
    "this region was not modeled by because the code assumes a circular keplerian disk structure .",
    "this result provides the first observational confirmation that the disk in tt hya is elliptical and asymmetric . moreover , the similarity between the tomogram based on the observed h@xmath0 spectra only and that based on the observed minus stellar contribution suggests that the gas in the accretion disk is optically thin at h@xmath0 , as assumed in the differencing procedure ( see @xcite ) .",
    "tomograms of another algol binary , cx dra , suggested that the disk in that system was not optically thin @xcite .",
    "the main achievements of this work can be summarized as follows :    * we have developed a systematic procedure to study the disks in algol - type binaries using spectroscopic analysis , synthetic spectra , and tomography .",
    "this procedure can be used to study other algol disk systems like tt hya ( e.g. , au mon ) . with minor modifications",
    ", this approach can be used to study the disks in novae and cataclysmic variables . *",
    "new velocity curves and orbital parameters have been derived for tt hya from an analysis of h@xmath0 and uv spectra .",
    "our study has more than quadrupled the previous 27 radial velocity measurements and nearly tripled their precision .",
    "* the derived orbital eccentricity was found to be small , but nonzero ( @xmath120 based on the best photometric fit ) . an eccentric orbit could lead to enhanced mass transfer near and shortly after periastron , which might explain the enhanced activity of tt hya and other algols at these phases . *",
    "a lower limit of the mass transfer rate was estimated ( @xmath121 ) . *",
    "the calculations of the synthetic h@xmath0 spectra have been improved within the code compared to those of @xcite . specifically , the electron number density is now calculated within the code from the density , temperature , and abundances .",
    "the inclusion of the gas stream and the adoption of a lower surface gravity for the primary star led to an improved match between the observed and synthetic spectra .",
    "* high resolution iue spectra of tt hya outside of the eclipses were compared with synthetic spectra calculated by .",
    "we have demonstrated that the ultraviolet spectrum results from the combined contributions of the primary star and cooler surrounding disk . *",
    "the ultraviolet spectra were used to refine the properties of the accretion disk .",
    "a reliable disk temperature of about @xmath89k was found from comparisons between the observed and synthetic uv spectra of the fe  and al  lines in the iron curtain at out - of - eclipse phases .",
    "* radial velocity measurements of the iue spectra confirmed that they are decoupled from the radial velocity curve of the primary star .",
    "we propose that they originate from elliptical stream lines within the accretion disk .",
    "* the comparison between the observed and synthetic uv spectra showed that the emission lines of higher ionization species ( e.g. , al , si , c ) seen during total eclipse can not originate in the disk .",
    "these emission lines could originate from the stream - disk interaction region . *",
    "the non - stellar pseudo - continuum during the total eclipse was studied and quantitatively explained by calculations of synthetic spectra .",
    "this continuum is most likely due to the thermal and scattered emission in the lines which becomes unresolved at lower resolution .",
    "* doppler tomography of the observed h@xmath0 line confirmed the dominant disk - like structure of the circumstellar material .",
    "tomography of the difference spectra after subtracting the synthetic spectrum of the stars and disk revealed the presence of the gas stream .",
    "this gas stream was modeled effectively with the code once accurate disk and gas stream parameters were known . *",
    "the presence of an asymmetric disk was suggested by the non - circular nature of the radial velocity measurements of the uv lines and confirmed by the comparison between the h@xmath0 tomograms and simulated tomograms based on hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite .",
