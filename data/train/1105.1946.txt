    "in heavy - ion collisions with bombarding energies per nucleon in the order of nucleon binding energy , the mean - field approach , in terms of time - dependent hartree - fock equations ( tdhf ) , provides a good approximation for describing the average behavior of the collision dynamics @xcite .",
    "for example , the mean - field approximation gives a good description of energy dissipation and nucleon drift in deep inelastic heavy - ion collisions ( dic ) .",
    "however , the collective motion is treated in nearly classical , deterministic manner and the fluctuations of collective variables are severely underestimated @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the mean - field approach , it is not possible to describe energy distributions and fragment mass and charge distributions in dic .",
    "there are other reactions , such as heavy - ion fusion at near - barrier energies , spinodal dynamics leading to nuclear fragmentation @xcite , in which dynamics of density fluctuations play a dominant role .",
    "much work has been done to improve the transport approach for describing dynamics of density fluctuations beyond the mean - field approximation . basically , there are two different sources of density fluctuations : ( i ) fluctuations induces by binary collisions @xcite and ( ii ) mean - field fluctuations .",
    "fluctuations and dissipation induced by collisional mechanism are important at the intermediate and high energies .",
    "transport description can be extended in a stochastic approach by including the binary collision term and its fluctuating part in an analogous manner to the langevin treatment of brownian motion . in the semiclassical limit , this model is known as the boltzmann - langevin approach . on the other hand , as indicated in a recent work @xcite , the mean - field fluctuations originating from the quantal and thermal fluctuations at the initial state become the dominant source of density fluctuations at low energies .",
    "the theory that includes mean - field fluctuations is referred to as the stochastic mean - field ( smf ) approach .    in recent works ,",
    "the smf approach was employed to extract transport coefficients associated with relative momentum and nucleon exchange in low - energy heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "also , some applications of the smf approach have been carried out for analyzing the early development of spinodal instabilities @xcite .",
    "microscopic transport coefficients extracted from the smf have similar forms with those familiar from the phenomenological nucleon exchange model @xcite , but they provide a more refined description of one - body dissipation and the associated fluctuation mechanism . in these initial investigations , for simplicity , we calculated transport coefficients for symmetric central collisions .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the variances of the fragment mass distributions calculated with the microscopic diffusion coefficient extracted from the smf approach compares very well with the empirical result @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the mass variance and the total number of nucleon exchange between projectile and target nuclei up to time @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "this observation provides another convincing support for the validity of the smf approach . in symmetric collisions ,",
    "the mass and charge numbers of the fragment do not change on the average , i.e. , the mean value of nucleon drift coefficient vanishes .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate nucleon exchange mechanism in central collisions of asymmetric @xmath5ca + @xmath6zr system . in sec .",
