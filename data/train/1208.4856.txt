    "whereas for weak corrugation the overall colloid mobility @xmath29 is remarkably constant for both incommensurate densities , we find in fact that by increasing the corrugation amplitude @xmath30 the mobility of the ai configuration drops to zero at small force , and pinning with static friction reemerges despite incommensurability . by contrast , si configurations remain superlubric up to much larger @xmath30",

    "the 1d incommensurate fk model crosses the so - called aubry transition @xcite where superlubricity is lost , and pinning sets in with static friction despite incommensurability . even in the present 2d case",
    "it is qualitatively expected that all incommensurate colloids , both underdense ( @xmath35 ) and overdense ( @xmath36 ) will undergo an aubry - like superlubric - to - pinned transition for increasing corrugation .",
    "this expectation is confirmed in our 2d model colloid system .",
    "figure  [ bulk_anti_transition : fig ] ( obtained by independent simulations of the infinite - size system with periodic boundary conditions ) shows the aubry - like pinning transition crossed by an ai ( @xmath37 ) underdense colloid at a critical corrugation , here @xmath38 .",
    "the threshold aubry corrugation depends upon @xmath39 , and is much larger for overdense si than for underdense ai colloids .",
    "this strong asymmetry of static friction  and of all other properties  between overdense ( @xmath40 ) and underdense ( @xmath41 ) colloids can be rationalized , in the limit of strong corrugation @xmath42 , in terms of the large physical difference between solitons , defects formed by lines of lattice interstitials , and antisolitons , lines of vacancies .",

    "they move with a speed @xmath51 much larger than the average lattice speed @xmath52 , because @xmath53 by particle conservation .",
    "the moving structure is a distortion of the original triangular soliton / antisoliton pattern ( fig .",
    "[ mobility : fig]b ) induced by the circular shape of the confining potential , and by the directional sliding . with increasing @xmath1 , the soliton arrangements elongate into a stripe - like pattern perpendicular to the driving direction .",
    "comparison with experimental pictures is quite realistic , especially when focusing ( as done in experiment ) on the central sample region , far from boundaries . in the ai superlubric colloid @xmath35 ,",
    "preformed antisolitons fly ( leftward ) across the colloid lattice antiparallel to the ( rightward ) force .",

    "colloid @xmath40 conversely , preformed solitons fly rightward , parallel to the force",
    ". solitons , unlike antisolitons , are not automatically spawned at the boundary , owing to the decreasing density .",
    "instead , an antisoliton / soliton pairs must nucleate first , near the boundary , and this is possible only if the force overcomes the nucleation barrier . below this threshold ,",
    "we observe that a steady dc external force eventually sweeps out all the preformed solitons transforming the colloid to an artificially pinned , immobile co state .",
    "finally , the pinned co colloid @xmath54 only moves after static friction is overcome . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ nucleation ] , motion starts off here by nucleation of soliton - antisoliton pairs inside the bulk  here close to the left edge because the central region tends to be slightly overdense .",
    "the antisolitons flow leftwards and are absorbed by the left edge , becoming undetectable to the optically monitored central part of the colloid , where only solitons transit , as seen in experiment .",
    "this type of commensurate nucleation has been described in considerable detail in literature , including finite - temperature effects @xcite .",
    "we note here that in the pinned co colloid the soliton or antisoliton density , initially zero , actually increases with increasing sliding velocity ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ mobility : fig]d , e ) , as opposed to frankly incommensurate cases , where it is nearly constant .",
    "much can be learned about the habit of sliding colloids from their behavior and their structural phase diagram , first at rest and then under sliding . with @xmath26 , close to commensurate but not exactly commensurate , the colloid monolayer can realize in the periodic potential two alternative static arrangements which are local minima of the overall free energy : a fully lattice - matched co state , or a weakly incommensurate state characterized by a sparse soliton ( ai or si ) superstructure , with a density fluctuating around the local value prescribed by the @xmath55 balance . comparing the potential energy of these two states as a function of @xmath39 , the static phase diagram contains , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ static : fig ] , a fully commensurate extended co region separated from the ai and si regions by commensurate - incommensurate transitions , well known in adsorbed surface layers @xcite .",
    "the co region is wider on the si side ( @xmath56 ) than the ai side ( @xmath57 ) , another manifestation of the si - ai asymmetry discussed above .",
    "the co range naturally widens or shrinks when the corrugation amplitude @xmath30 is increased or decreased .",
    "c +    under an external force @xmath1 , sliding effectively tilts the balance between the two static phases ( loosely speaking , for of course under sliding the physical significance of a `` phase '' is not the same as at rest ) sliding populates the former co phase with solitons / antisolitons , turning it effectively into si or ai . in the running state , the colloid average density increases or decreases from 1 to a value closer to the nominal @xmath39 of the colloid at @xmath58 .",
    "this explains why in a quasi - commensurate configuration with @xmath40 such as that shown by bohlein _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , solitons ( and not , e.g. , soliton - antisoliton pairs ) sweep the colloid upon depinning , as also seen in fig .  [",
    "mobility : fig]d , e .",
    "it is curious to note here the different fate of solitons in the slightly overdense co and in the si phases . in the co phase",
    "they do not exist at rest , but they appear after depinning and under sliding . in the si phase",
    "they exist at rest , but they could be swept out under dc sliding , when a weak external force can turn the si colloid into effectively co. we never saw this sweepout phenomenon on the ai side .",
    "we turn now to frictional work , a quantity of crucial importance for the tribological significance of colloid sliding .",
    "we can write the overall power balance as the scalar product of the instantaneous velocity @xmath59 of each colloid @xmath60 by the net force acting on it , @xmath61 , including both the bare external force @xmath62 and the viscous drag @xmath63 .",
    "this product vanishes instantaneously at any time when either colloids are stuck ( @xmath64 ) or else when the corrugation potential is absent , so that @xmath65 . after averaging over a very long trajectory ,",
    "the balance reads @xmath66 where @xmath67 . under steady - state sliding conditions where @xmath68 , the effective friction power @xmath69 is exactly balanced by an internal kinetic energy excess rate . per colloid",
    "particle , @xmath69 is @xmath70 where small center of mass fluctuations are neglected , by assuming @xmath71 .",
    "figure  [ bulk_anti_friction : fig ] shows @xmath72 ( briefly referred to as `` friction '' in the following ) for the special case of the ai underdense phase as extracted as a function of @xmath73 through a `` bulk '' simulation ( with periodic boundary conditions as in fig .  [ bulk_anti_transition : fig ] ) . the main features found are ( i ) a linear rise at low cm speed ; ( ii ) a decline at large speed ; ( iii ) a maximum at some intermediate corrugation - dependent speed .",
    "we moreover observe that ( iv ) the dissipated power increases ( not unexpectedly ) with corrugation ; and ( v ) the corresponding frictional maximum simultaneously shifts to larger speed .",
    "the qualitative interpretation of these results is relatively straightforward , and yet revealing .",
    "( i , iv ) at low sliding velocities the motion of solitons / antisolitons involves the viscous motion of individual particles with a velocity distribution whose spread toward higher values rises proportionally to the sliding speed and inversely proportional to their spatial width",
    ". as shown , e.g.  within the 1d fk model @xcite , but also in the present simulations , the width @xmath74 of solitons / antisolitons increases roughly as @xmath75 with the dimensionless interparticle interaction strength @xmath76 measured relative to the periodic corrugation amplitude .",
    "the decrease in width with increasing corrugation @xmath30 requires an increasing instantaneous speed of individual particles in the soliton / antisoliton , yielding an increasing viscous friction , and a decreasing overall mobility as observed .",
    "( ii , iii , v ) at high sliding velocities , the colloid relaxation time exceeds the soliton / antisoliton transit time across the peierls - nabarro barrier @xcite so that their spatial structure is gradually washed out by the sliding motion .",
    "the critical speed where the smoothening behavior takes over , roughly corresponding to maximal friction , increases as corrugation increases , corresponding to narrower solitons / antisolitons that are harder to wash out .",
    "the increase of friction with corrugation strength @xmath30 , plotted in the inset for a chosen speed , is found to be quadratic at weak corrugation , gradually turning to linear for larger values .",
    "linear response theory naturally accounts for the quadratic increase , a behavior first discussed by cieplak _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and observed in quartz crystal microbalance experiments @xcite",
    ".    demonstrated for a specific ai case with antisolitons , the above results appear in fact of general validity for infinitely extended sliders of controlled colloid density , and apply equally well although with great quantitative asymmetry to si with solitons , once their larger widths and greater mobilities and weaker peierls - nabarro barriers are taken into account .",
    "in this study we have presented initial simulation results and theory that strongly vouch in favor of sliding of colloid layers on laser - originated corrugations as a promising tool for future tribological advances .",
    "the motion of solitons and antisolitons known from experiment is reproduced and understood , unraveling the subtle depinning mechanisms at play .",
    "the presence of aubry transitions is pointed out for future verification , along with a strong asymmetry between underdense and overdense incommensurate layers . of direct tribological interest",
    ", we anticipate the behavior of friction with corrugation ( mimicking `` load '' ) and with sliding velocity , with results which , while of course generally very different from the classic laws of macroscopic friction , are highly relevant to friction at nano and mesoscopic scales .",
    "our approach moreover indicates a strong complementarity between theory plus simulation , and experiment , an aspect which we intend to pursue further .",
    "there are many lines of future research that this study implicitly suggests .",
    "one line will be to pursue the analogy of the sliding over a periodic potential with other systems such as driven josephson junctions @xcite , and sliding charge - density waves @xcite .",
    "time - dependent nonlinear phenomena such as the shapiro steps @xcite should become accessible to colloid sliding too .",
    "a second line is to include non - periodic complications to the corrugation potential , including the quasicrystal geometry such as that recently realized @xcite and beyond that , random , or pseudo - random corrugations to be realized in the future .",
    "a third line involves the investigation of the lubricant speed quantization phenomena , characterized so far only theoretically @xcite .",
    "a further very important development will be to address colloidal friction in larger , mesoscopic or macroscopic size systems , whose phenomenology is accessible so far only by a few , very ingenious , but very limited , methods @xcite",
