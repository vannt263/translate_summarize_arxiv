    "central exclusive production is now recognized as an important search scenario for new physics at the lhc , see for instance , @xcite  -  @xcite and references therein .",
    "the experimental studies of such processes are at the heart of the fp420 project @xcite which proposes to complement the cms and atlas experiments at the lhc by installing additional forward proton detectors 420 m away from the interaction region .",
    "in particular , these detectors will allow the measurement of the exclusive production of new heavy particles , such as higgs bosons .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite  -  @xcite such measurements will be able to provide valuable information on the higgs sector of mssm and other popular bsm scenarios .    indeed , central exclusive processes are very interesting both from the viewpoint of theory , since they contain a mixture of soft and hard qcd effects , and of experiment , as they provide a clean environment to measure the quantum numbers and masses of new objects which may be seen at the lhc .",
    "moreover , the @xmath5 selection rule ( @xmath6 is the projection of the total angular momentum along the proton beam direction ) , arising in central exclusive diffractive processes @xcite , provides a unique possibility to study directly the coupling of the higgs - like bosons to the bottom quarks , because the lo qcd background is strongly suppressed by the @xmath5 rule .",
    "as is well known , the determination of the @xmath7 yukawa coupling appears to be very difficult for other search channels at the lhc .",
    "the theoretical formalism @xcite needed to describe a central exclusive diffractive process of a system @xmath8 contains quite distinct parts , shown symbolically in fig .  [ fig : parts ] . in brief",
    ", we first have to calculate the @xmath9 hard subprocess , @xmath10 , convoluted with the gluon distributions @xmath11 .",
    "next we must account for the higher loop corrections which reflect the absence of additional qcd radiation in the hard subprocess  that is , for the sudakov suppression factor @xmath12 .",
    "finally we must enter soft physics to calculate the survival probability @xmath13 of the rapidity gaps either side of @xmath8  that is the probability that the exclusive nature of the process will not be destroyed by the secondaries produced by the rescattering of the incoming particles .",
    "the uncertainties associated with the prediction of the rate of a central exclusive process are potentially not small .",
    "each of the above stages has its own uncertainties .",
    "therefore , it is important to perform checks of the approach using processes with appreciable cross sections that will be experimentally accessible in the first data runs of the lhc with integrated luminosities in the range 100 @xmath14 to 1 @xmath15 . here , our aim is to identify processes where the different ingredients of the formalism used to calculate central exclusive production can be tested experimentally , more or less independently .    the outgoing protons in the forward regions of the main lhc detectors will be measured by the proton tagging detectors ( roman pots ) . at 220 m on either side of the cms detector there exists the roman pots of the totem experiment @xcite .",
    "atlas will have the alfa detector @xcite at 240 m as well as the proposed rp220 detector @xcite at 220 m .",
    "as we already mentioned , fp420 project @xcite proposes to install forward proton taggers for both atlas and cms . note",
    "that rp220 and fp420 aim to operate at high luminosities .",
    "however it is quite likely that for the first 1 - 2 years of lhc running the forward proton detectors will not be operational .",
    "we therefore first consider measurements which do not rely on tagging the forward outgoing protons .    even without proton tagging , diffractive measurements at the lhc",
    "can be performed through the detection of rapidity gaps .",
    "this is a well known technique used extensively at hera and the tevatron .",
    "a summary of the forward detectors instrumented around atlas and cms is given , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "the central detectors ( cd ) of cms and atlas have an acceptance in pseudorapidity @xmath16 of roughly @xmath17 for tracking information and @xmath18 for calorimeter information .",
    "we will discuss a situation where a heavy system @xmath8 is detected in the region @xmath17 , and where the calorimeters in @xmath19 interval , are used to select events with rapidity gaps .    in the present paper the word _",
    "gap _ means a rapidity interval @xmath20 devoid of hadronic activity  for the charged particles we assume a ` track veto ' , while the absence of neutrals should be checked by the calorimeters .",
    "the amplitudes of all the processes discussed below are infrared stable and are not affected by the possibility of soft gluon emission .    due to angular ordering , which originates from coherence , in those processes where the gap is provided by @xmath0-boson exchange ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : wz](a , c ) below ) , the only possible soft gluons occur at the edge of the gap and arise from the corresponding quark jet . these gluons should be accounted for in the jet searching algorithm . in cases",
    "where the gaps are associated with colour - singlet , two - gluon exchange ( as in central exclusive dijet production ) , the presence of sudakov - like @xmath12-factors in the unintegrated gluon distributions ( see eq.([eq : rat6 ] ) below ) guarantee that there is no emission of any additional soft gluons .",
    "the selection of rapidity gap events by a ` veto ' trigger can be used up to rather large luminosities , when the mean number , @xmath21 , of interactions per bunch crossing is sizeable .",
    "however at larger luminosities the efficiency of the trigger is reduced by a factor @xmath22  that is , by the probability to have no additional ` pile - up ' inelastic interaction in the bunch crossing .",
    "this probability can be measured independently in the same experiment .",
    "of course , the proposal to use calorimeters in the @xmath19 interval to select the events with a rapidity gap does not mean that we will only consider gaps with @xmath23 .",
    "first , part of the gap can be at smaller @xmath16 and , secondly , extensive additions are foreseen to enlarge the coverage in the forward regions and a zero degree calorimeter ( zdc ) with an acceptance for neutral particles with @xmath24 .",
    "both calorimeters have an electromagnetic and hadronic section .",
    "moreover , cms is expected to have integrated read out with totem ( see @xcite ) allowing cms to benefit from the totem forward coverage and totem , in turn , from the cms central coverage @xcite .",
    "atlas plan a cerenkov detector lucid with an acceptance @xmath25 and a zdc with an acceptance @xmath26 .",
    "diffractive studies are under discussion also at alice , see for instance , @xcite .",
    "the alice detector has a central barrel covering the pseudorapidity range @xmath27 and ( on one side ) a muon spectrometer covering the region of @xmath28 and a zdc .",
    "additional detectors for trigger purposes and for event classification are placed on both sides of the central barrel , such that the range @xmath29 is covered .",
    "this configuration allows the possibility of a ( double ) rapidity gap trigger by requiring no activity in the event classification detectors , see @xcite . ] .",
    "possible `` holes '' in particle observation in small rapidity intervals between different calorimeters do not affect our predictions very much .",
    "the probability to produce extra soft hadrons in the hole region only is proportional to the effective pomeron - pomeron cross section which is rather small , according to the triple - regge analysis of ua8 data @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the correction to be less than 3@xmath30 for a hole of size @xmath31 .",
    "the main uncertainties of the predictions for exclusive processes are associated with the calculation of    * the probability @xmath13 that additional soft secondaries will not populate the gaps separating the centrally produced system @xmath8 from the outgoing protons ( or the products of their dissociations ) factor , starting from the publications @xcite to more recent ones @xcite and references therein .",

    "[ fig : parts ] ) .",
    "we discuss below , in turn , possible checks of the various ingredients of the calculation of the exclusive cross sections . to be precise , we address the uncertainties ( i)-(iv ) in sections 3 - 6 respectively .",
    "as a rule , the gap survival probability , that is the probability that the secondaries produced in additional soft interactions do not populate the rapidity gaps , is calculated within a multichannel eikonal approach .",
    "this method of calculation implicitly assumes a factorization between the soft and hard parts of the process . the probability of elastic @xmath33 rescattering , shown symbolically by @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ fig : parts ] , can be calculated in a model independent way once the elastic @xmath33 amplitude is known , that is , the elastic cross section @xmath34 is measured at the lhc .",

    "the gap , @xmath39 , corresponding to @xmath0 exchange , is limited by the rapidity of the quark jet , which balances the transverse momentum of the @xmath0 boson ( which has a broad distribution with @xmath43 since it is driven by the @xmath44-channel @xmath0 propagator ) .    at first sight ,",
    "the probability for soft rescattering in such a process is rather small and we would expect @xmath45 .",

    "the continuous curve in fig .  [ fig : w2 ] was calculated under this assumption .",
    "on the other hand , in the extreme cases where we assume that the partons which participate in the process of fig .",
    "[ fig : wz](a ) are concentrated in the diffractive eigenstate with the lowest ( largest ) absorptive cross section , we obtain the results shown by the dashed ( dotted ) curves .",
    "a rather more realistic scenario ( see , for example , @xcite ) is to allocate the valence quark to the component with the smallest absorption and the sea quark to the component with largest cross section .",
    "the corresponding predictions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : w3 ] . since the valence quark contribution is more important for @xmath58 production and for the configuration with the largest gap size @xmath63 , the expected gap survival factor @xmath13 is found to be larger .",

    "[ fig : w3 ] , is rather small . with a more realistic assumption ( in which each diffractive state contains some part of the valence and some part of the sea ) the spread will be even smaller .    in the first lhc data",
    "runs it may be difficult to measure the absolute value of the cross section with sufficient accuracy .",
    "most probably the ratio ( @xmath0+gaps/@xmath0 inclusive ) will be measured first . in this case , the inclusive @xmath0 production process ( in the same kinematic region , fig .",
    "[ fig : wz](b ) ) plays the role of the luminosity monitor . note that the cross section for inclusive @xmath0 production is much larger than that with rapidity gaps .",
    "the reason is an inclusive @xmath0 is produced directly by @xmath64 fusion , which is prohibited for gap events since the colour flow produced by the @xmath44-channel quarks populates the @xmath65 rapidity gaps .",
    "of course , the survival factor @xmath13 measured in @xmath0+gaps events is quite different from that for exclusive higgs production , which comes from smaller values of @xmath48 .",
    "nevertheless this measurement is a useful check of the model for soft rescattering .",
    "it would appear that a good way to study the low @xmath48 region directly is to observe @xmath37 boson production via @xmath66 fusion , see fig .",
    "[ fig : wz](c ) . here ,",
    "both of the rapidity gaps originate from heavy boson exchange and the corresponding @xmath48 region is similar to that for central exclusive higgs production region , since , in general , the impact parameter distributions of quarks and gluons may be different . ] .",
    "the expected @xmath37+gaps cross section is of the order of 0.2 pb , and @xmath13=0.3 for @xmath67 and for quark jets with @xmath68 gev @xcite .",
    "again it would be sufficient to measure the ratio ( @xmath37+gaps/@xmath37 inclusive ) .",
    "one problem is that even with the @xmath68 gev cut , the qcd background arising from the qcd @xmath69 central exclusive production is comparable to the electroweak @xmath70 jet signal .",
    "therefore we should concentrate on the leptonic decay modes of the @xmath37 boson , which results in a smaller event rate searches at cms .",
    "the idea of track counting is close in spirit to the hadron level gap selection of @xcite and , as compared to the ( more ) standard calorimeter jet veto technique , the tcv has various advantages .",
    "in particular , it does not involve calorimeter scale uncertainties , suffers less from pile - up contributions and so can be used at higher luminosities .",
    "moreover , it is planned to apply this technique at cms using data on central @xmath71 events .",
    "though the original motivation for this analysis @xcite is to study the detector conditions , such a measurement , in particular , presented in terms of the ratio ( @xmath37+gaps/@xmath37 inclusive ) may appear to be one of the first tests of models for soft survival factor . ] .",
    "so far we have discussed measurements which do not depend on observing the forward protons . however , when the forward proton detectors become operational we can do more .",
    "both the longitudinal and transverse momentum of the forward protons can , in principle , be measured .",
    "hence we can study the @xmath46 behaviour of the cross section section for @xmath0+gap events , and scan the proton opacity , as described in @xcite .",
    "the cross section for the central exclusive production of a system @xmath8 is calculated using @xmath72 factorization , and essentially has the form @xcite @xmath73 the first factor , @xmath74 , is the soft survival factor discussed in the previous section and the factor @xmath75 arises from the integration over the transverse momentum of the forward proton assuming the form @xmath76 .",

    "@xmath41 , transferred through the rapidity gap in a central exclusive process is limited by the proton form factor .",

    "it is reasonable to assume the following factorization of the gluon distribution : @xmath82 .",
