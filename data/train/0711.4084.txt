    "a common way of describing solvation effects to biomolecular structure is to treat the solvent as a continuum of characteristic dielectric constant . the biomolecule of interest , i.e. a protein , dna , rna , glycolipid , etc .",
    "is considered in full atomic detail , while the surrounding medium is represented as structureless continuum interacting primarily via polarization , dispersion , repulsion and cavitation effects @xcite .",
    "the underlying physics concerned with polarization is then often expressed in terms of solutions to the poisson - boltzmann equation ( pb ) @xcite .",
    "approximations to the pb  motivated by simplified computational protocols  are standard practice e.g. the generalized born model ( gb ) @xcite .",
    "however , pb and gb are dealing with the polarization term only , and the other above mentioned interactions are usually treated by either first - principle @xcite or semi - empirical @xcite character .",
    "solutions to the pb are computed either by the finite difference method ( fdpb ) @xcite or by the boundary element method ( pb / bem ) @xcite .",
    "the latter is particularly intriguing since it reduces a three - dimensional integral over the entire volume to a two - dimensional surface integral , leading to considerable savings in computational time .",
    "both approaches depend fundamentally on the exact definition of the boundary between solute and solvent .",
    "all definitions are based on the area of the atoms exposed to the solvent , for instance the solvent accessible surface area ( sasa ) , the solvent excluded volume , or the molecular surface @xcite , which all depend on a chosen set of van der waals radii @xcite assigned to the center of the atoms .",
    "given the dependence on the exact geometry and quality of the boundary it appears necessary to study the geometric factors that influence the outcome of pb calculations in greater detail .",
    "this is particularly appropriate for semi - quantitative approaches @xcite where the demand on accuracy is a very sensitive issue @xcite .",
    "particular attention has to be drawn to factors such as i ) surface type and surface resolution , ii ) dependence on atomic model parameters , i.e. van der waals radii , iii ) generality and physicochemical significance . in this present work",
    "we provide such an analysis by focussing on each of these three points separately . at first",
    ", we employ different surface generation algorithms to a subset of randomly chosen protein structures of variable size and shape .",
    "pb / bem calculations are carried out with increasing resolution of the boundary . optimal surface resolution and surface generation parameters that guarantee numerical convergence and methodic stability",
    "are derived .",
    "next , we use these optimized parameters for a set of model peptides and vary the van der waals radii in a systematic way . the reference set of model peptides",
    "is considered at a high level of quantum chemical theory , i.e. pcm @xcite using the becke-98 density functional @xcite and the basis set of sadlej @xcite .",
    "the aim of this second step is to identify optimal van der waals radii within the pb / bem approach that will lead to boundaries and solute geometries of similar size and shape as those used in the high - level pcm calculations . finally , with the optimized parameters determined in the initial two stages we compute actual pb / bem polarization energies in order to obtain a close match with the quantum chemical results obtained from the reference set .",
    "a set of different protein structures is randomly selected from the protein data bank @xcite .",
    "the actual download site used is the repository pdb - reprdb @xcite .",
    "default options are applied with the following exceptions : i ) * number of residues less than 40 excluded  no * , ii ) * include mutant  no * , iii ) * exclude complex * , iv ) * exclude fragment * , v ) * include nmr  no * , vi ) * include membrane proteins  no*. a total of 28 structures of different protein sizes and shapes ( see table [ table1 ] ) are chosen .",
    "the pdb codes of the samples are , 2erl , 1p9ga , 1fd3a , 1n13e , 1brf , 1parb , 1k6u , 1avoa , 1scma , 1otfa , 1djta , 1ku5 , 1k3bc , 1r2 m , 1cc8 , 1l9la , 1zxtd , 1gyja , 1t8k , 1xmk , 1ynrb , 1ezga , 1c5e , 1sau , 1wn2 , 1jbe , 1c7k and 1wkr .",
    "four different programs to calculate molecular surfaces have been employed : the connolly program * msroll * @xcite , the * sims * program @xcite , the * msms * program by sanner @xcite and a self - written program based on an estimation of the sasa @xcite . however , we detected already in early stages of this investigations problems with varying van der waals radii and found indications that the sasa is not an appropriate choice for this kind of application .",
    "hence , we have dropped the latter two programs , and most of the analysis is done with programs * msroll * and * sims*.    downloaded pdb structures are cleaned from multichain entries , hetatm lines connect lines , anisou lines , counter ions , water molecules and the footer section .",
    "program molden @xcite is used to visualize the downloaded pdb structures after cleaning and the force field * tinker amber * is selected before a new pdb file is written out from within molden using option write_with_hydrogens. since molden always uses the default hip - type in amber jargon , his residues need to be converted to hip types , as well as cys residues engaged in disulfide bonds need to be converted to cyx - type residues .",
    "occasional cases with pro being the initial residue are manually edited and initial pros removed .",
    "amber non - bonded parameters @xcite , i.e. charges and van der waals radii are assigned to all the atoms in the protein structures . in this first part of the study ,",
    "the vdw - radii are increased by a factor of 1.12 and atomic partial charges are scaled down by another factor of 0.9 @xcite .    the msroll program is used with varying choices of the fineness value ( the * -f * command line argument ) which defines the resolution of the surface . with smaller values the resolution of the surface becomes better but computational cost will increase .",
    "the probe radius ( the * -p * command line argument ) is set to 1.5  .",
    "analytically calculated sasa and molecular volumes are recorded , and the data file containing triangulation details is translated into a human readable format , and critical items ( for example almost coinciding triangles ) removed .",
    "the sims program is used with identical arguments to those employed in msroll .",
    "similarly , varying the resolution of the surface triangulation into small sized triangles means adjusting the * dot - density * parameter in sims .",
    "higher values for this parameter will yield higher surface resolutions but also increase the computational demand .",
    "we record the number of be , number of iterations , sasa and volume for comparison .",
    "inner / outer dielectric constants at the molecular boundary are set to 1.0 and 80.0 respectively . the serial version of the pb / bem program * polch * @xcite is used .",
    "critical cases with additional secondary cavities located in the interior part of the proteins are excluded .",
    "amber van der waals radii and partial charges @xcite are applied .",
    "using our own tool chain for the assignment allows us to conveniently scale these data , as well as to write out in the same instance the corresponding parameter files required by the molecular surface programs .",
    "the most prominent combinations of peptidic @xmath4-angles @xcite are used to construct different conformations of dipeptides .",
    "only homodimers are considered .",
    "all 20 types of different amino acids are used for this combinatorial approach .",
    "zwitter - ionic forms are built and 9 conformations per class of amino acid are taken into account leading to all in all 180 structures .",
    "program `` protein.x '' from the tinker package version 4.2 is employed @xcite .",
    "each of these reference structures is subjected to pcm @xcite calculations at the becke-98 @xcite level of density functional theory ( dft ) using the high - quality basis set of sadlej @xcite within the gaussian-03 suite of programs @xcite .",
    "geometric properties , i.e. the molecular volume and the molecular surface area , as well as polarization free energies are extracted from the reference calculations and used as a base line when comparing to pb / bem data .",
    "the computational demand of these reference calculations is significant .",
    "for example , ww - conformations require on the order of 6 weeks ( and beyond ) single - processor time on modern computing architectures .",
    "we start with pb / bema calculations for a set of protein structures ( pdb codes summarized in table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the boundary discretization is achieved with two independent programs , msroll @xcite and sims @xcite .",
    "boundary resolution into bes is steadily increased with either program and independent pb / bem results are computed for each particular boundary decomposition .",
    "a typical plot of the trend of @xmath3 as a function of number of bes is shown in figure [ figure1 ] for the protein structure with pdb code 1c5e .",
    "similar plots for the other examples in table [ table1 ] are provided as supplementary material .",
    "both approaches converge to identical results in the limit of large numbers of bes .",
    "the importance of well - resolved boundaries becomes clear from figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "errors on the order of @xmath5 are easily introduced when working in the non - converged domain .",
    "connolly s msroll program ( red triangles in figure [ figure1 ] ) reaches a plateau value in a continuous manner , while the sims program ( blue spheres in figure [ figure1 ] ) finds its limit value within an alternating sequence .",
    "the sims program reaches convergence much faster than the connolly program .",
    "the quality of the computed molecular boundaries is comparable , see , for instance , the values of molecular surfaces and volumes ( final two columns in table [ table1 ] ) obtained with either program .",
    "sims seems to overestimate the volume by a small margin of roughly @xmath6 .",
    "the recommended average size of bes for converged results using msroll is on the order of 0.11 @xmath7 while sims would require an average size of 0.31 @xmath7 .",
    "both numbers are close to the value of 0.4 @xmath7 advocated in quantum chemistry @xcite .",
    "a reference set of dipeptides in different conformations ( 9 per species ) is constructed .",
    "only homodipeptides comprising all 20 types of naturally occurring amino acids are considered .",
    "thus a total number of 180 dipeptidic reference structures is set up .",
    "the zwitterionic form is used throughout .",
    "each of these structures is computed at the becke-98 level of theory @xcite using the basis set of sadlej @xcite and the pcm model @xcite for solvation free energies .",
    "geometric properties such as the cavity volume and the cavity surface area are extracted from each of the reference calculations .",
    "all 180 structures are also computed within the pb / bem approach using optimized parameters for the boundary resolution determined in stage i of this study .",
    "however , only the sims program is used .",
    "we define a global deviation from the reference data by @xmath8 where @xmath9 runs over the conformations and @xmath10 over the different types of homodipeptides , i.e. gg , aa , vv , etc .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 refers to a specific scaling factor used when constructing the boundaries within the pb / bem approach . in particular",
    "this scaling makes the van der waals radii larger or smaller by a certain fraction . the amber default set of van der waals radii",
    "is used @xcite .",
    "a similar criterion is used for comparing molecular volumes , @xmath12 and the dependence on the scaling factor @xmath11 is shown in figures [ figure2 ] and [ figure3 ] . as becomes clear from figures [ figure2 ] and [ figure3 ] the best match to the reference data is obtained when scaling the amber van der waals radii by a factor of 1.07 .",
    "detailed data with respect to conformational averages per type of dipeptide are shown in tables [ table2 ] and [ table3 ] .",
    "using the optimized parameters obtained in the previous two stages leads us to the final step of directly comparing polarization free energies @xmath3 computed within the pb / bem approximation and at the pcm level of theory . the idea is to identify another uniform scaling factor @xmath13 which applied to the amber default charges would result in an optimal match to the reference polarization free energies .",
    "thus another deviation criterion is introduced , @xmath14 that allows to identify the optimal value of @xmath13 .",
    "the dependence of the pb / bem polarization free energies on the charge scaling factor @xmath13 is shown in figure [ figure4 ] . the trend shown in figure",
    "[ figure4 ] suggests an optimal value of @xmath13 very close to 1.0 , hence no charge scaling is required .",
    "this result i ) emphasizes the broad applicability of amber partial charges and ii ) circumvents conceptual difficulties that would arise when charges had to be scaled , i.e. modified net charges in proteins , non - neutral forms , etc .",
    "a detailed analysis with respect to the magnitude of the average deviation of each particular type of dipeptide studied is shown in table [ table4 ] .",
    "motivated by our recent high - performance solution to poisson boltzmann calculations @xcite we have now tested the influence of the many critical parameters involved .",
    "one obvious issue is the exact choice and composition of the boundary between solute and solvent . at first",
    ", we have to ensure the numerical stability within the selected level of approximation .",
    "in order to address this problem we have carried out pb / bem calculations on a large sample of different proteins .",
    "when using different programs to create the boundary surface and increasing systematically the resolution of these surfaces into small - sized boundary elements , a recommended threshold size of about 0.31 @xmath7 for the average be is identified when using program sims @xcite which showed faster convergence than the well - known connolly program @xcite .",
    "although giving rise to very fine - resolved boundary surfaces , hence large numbers of bes , this value is close to the corresponding value of 0.4 @xmath7 frequently advised in quantum chemical models @xcite . as a consequence , even proteins of modest size",
    "thus require consideration of vast numbers of bes ( see for example table [ table1 ] ) , and the importance of efficient means of solving the computational problem is underlined again .",
    "after having established the necessary degree of boundary partitioning in the first stage , we performed a systematic comparison against a reference set of dipeptides computed at a high level of quantum chemical theory .",
    "consideration of geometric factors revealed that when applying a scaling factor of about 1.07 to amber default van der waals radii , rather good agreement can be reached between the reference geometries and the geometries in the pb / bem approach .",
    "the recommended value of 1.07 is somewhat smaller than a factor found previously ( 1.12 of ref @xcite ) and reflects the much finer resolved boundary surfaces used in this present work .",
    "the final step was to compare actual calculations of the polarization free energies to each other .",
    "following previous attempts , we wanted to derive another scaling factor that , when applied to amber partial charges , would yield a close match to the reference polarization free energies .",
    "the trend visible in figure [ figure4 ] indicates that no scaling of the charges is necessary : they are already close to optimal .",
    "this is an unexpected  but very welcome  result , as it eliminates potential secondary problems that would emerge with modifying charges .",
    "again , this is another consequence of the much finer resolved boundary surfaces in this present work as opposed to previous results @xcite where a scaling factor of 0.9 had been found .",
    "combined employment of small - sized bes ( @xmath15 0.3 @xmath7 on average ) , slightly increased amber van der waals radii ( by a factor of 1.07 ) , and default amber partial charges leads to good quality estimates of the polarization free energy , @xmath3 , for proteins within the pb / bem framework .    * acknowledgements * this work was supported in part by the national institutes of health grant gm62838 and by a grant of the national science foundation ( che-0313618 ) .",
