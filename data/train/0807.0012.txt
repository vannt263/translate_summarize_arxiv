    "their emission covers very wide range of frequencies : a highly variable prompt phase radiates @xmath3100 kev gamma rays , while a subsequent afterglow radiates radio to x - ray photons .",
    "it is likely that the bulk of these photons are emitted by gyration of relativistic electrons in magnetic fields  e.g .",

    "the relativistic electrons are accelerated in either internal dissipation ( for prompt emission ) or external shocks ( for afterglows ) . for reviews ,",

    "gev photons were detected as well from several grbs by the energetic gamma ray experimental telescope ( egret ) on board the _ compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) _",

    "this is because the relevant emission parameters such as the energy fraction of the grb jets going to electrons ( @xmath4 ) and magnetic fields ( @xmath5 ) are relatively well measured from the afterglow spectra as well as light curves ; the typical values are @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in the prompt emission ,",
    "@xmath4 is similar or even higher , as evident from the high efficiency of this phase , while @xmath5 is not well constrained .",
    "thus , there should be a significant inverse - compton ( ic ) component accompanying the synchrotron radiation in both the afterglow and prompt emission .",
    "the luminosities of the synchrotron and ic are expected to be comparable as ic - to - synchrotron luminosity ratio is roughly given by @xmath8 , according to theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "these @xmath3100 grbs should also be compared with the predictions of ssc model , because the fluence upper limits in the egret energy band are comparable to the fluence of prompt emission collected by burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) instrument onboard _",
    "cgro_. as the experimental bound is already strong , while theoretical models of ssc process predict a large fluence for the egret energy range , we derive meaningful constraints from egret data analysis on the physics of the high - energy emission mechanisms of grbs .",

    "we use our results to predict the expected number of grbs that would be detected by the _ gamma - ray large area space telescope ( glast)_. the _ glast _ satellite is equipped with the large area telescope ( lat ) , which is an upgraded version of egret . since revealing the high - energy emission mechanisms of grbs are one of the important objectives of _ glast _ , our prediction should give a useful guideline .",

    "if the prompt and/or afterglow emission is due to synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons ( with lorentz factor @xmath9 ) , then there must be an accompanying ic component from the same electrons scattering off the synchrotron photons .",
    "the spectral shape of the ic emission is almost the same as the synchrotron radiation ( shifted by @xmath10 ) , and is expected to fall around the gev range during both the prompt and afterglow phases . for @xmath11 , and assuming that there is no `` klein - nishina suppression '' and that the emitting electrons are fast cooling , the ic fluence is related to the synchrotron fluence simply through @xmath12 .",
    "thus , assuming that the microphysics do not vary much from burst to burst , it is natural to assume proportionality between the synchrotron mev fluence ( observed by batse ) and the gev synchrotron plus ic fluence ( observed by egret and in the future by _",
    "glast _ ) : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are coefficients for the proportionality due to synchrotron and ic processes .",
    "note that the synchrotron fluence in the gev range can be extrapolated relatively easily , if we assume that the spectrum extends up to such high energies .",
    "thus , we here focus on theoretical evaluation of the ic component . at first approximation ,",
    "the coefficient @xmath15 is roughly @xmath8 from considerations above , and thus we define @xmath16 where for the prompt emission @xmath17 while for the afterglow @xmath18 is the afterglow fluence within the radio to x - ray energy bands .",
    "correction factors @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the effect of klein - nishina suppression and detector energy window , respectively , which are given below .",
    "we define typical frequencies for both synchrotron ( @xmath21 ) and ic ( @xmath22 ) as the frequencies where most of the energies are radiated in case that the klein - nishina cross section does not play an important role ; i.e. , where @xmath23 for each component is peaked in this case . from relativistic kinematics",
    ", these two typical frequencies are related through @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a characteristic lorentz factor of the electrons that dominate the synchrotron power @xcite ; this is true in the fast cooling regime , which is the case in the most of our discussions @xcite .",
    "the klein - nishina effect is relevant if a photon energy in the electron rest frame exceeds the electron rest mass energy , and this condition is formulated as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the bulk lorentz factor of the ejecta , which is on the order of 100 in the prompt phase of grbs and their early afterglows .",
    "upscattering synchrotron photons to energies above @xmath28 is highly suppressed , which results in ic cutoff at @xmath29 .",
    "besides producing a spectral cutoff , the klein - nishina effect also modifies the way electrons cool , which is relevant for the gev emission and is also included in @xmath30 .",
    "electrons with energies above klein - nishina threshold ( for a given seed - photon energy ) can lose their energies only through synchrotron radiation , while the lower - energy ones can cool through both processes .",
    "such an effect has been studied in the case where the seed photons for ic scattering are provided by an external sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . however , in the case of ssc mechanism , since the seed photons are emitted from synchrotron process due to the same electron population , we should properly take into account feedback . giving full details on this",
    "is beyond the scope of the present paper , but some results are summarized briefly in appendix  [ app : kn ] ( see also @xcite ) . here we only show the approximate analytic form of @xmath30 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the lorentz factor of electrons for which photons at @xmath33 are in the klein - nishina regime .",
    "the energy of an observed photon with frequency @xmath34 as measured in the rest frame of an electron with lorentz factor @xmath35 is @xmath36 where the @xmath37 factor converts the photon energy from the observer frame to the plasma rest frame and the @xmath35 factor converts it to the electron rest frame .",
    "since such a photon is in the klein - nishina regime of an electron with lorentz factor @xmath35 once its energy in the electron rest frame is larger than @xmath38 we obtain : @xmath39 this klein - nishina feedback effect modifies the spectrum shape of both synchrotron and ic emissions ( in addition to the klein - nishina cutoff for ic ) .",
    "we note that equation  ( [ eq : eta kn ] ) provides a solution that agrees within a factor of @xmath32 with the one obtained by numerically solving equation  ( [ eq : y ] ) .",
    "this precision is sufficiently good for our purpose , especially because it is well within the uncertainty ranges of other parameters .    by @xmath20 , we take into account the fraction of the ic fluence that falls into the gev detector energy bands .",
    "egret window is between @xmath40 mev and @xmath41 gev while _",

    "the ratio between the synchrotron emissivity and the synchrotron photon field density is in a steady state .",
    "when @xmath58 the synchrotron photon field density may be significantly lower than in the steady state case @xcite , thereby suppressing the ic component .",

    "becomes significant for large @xmath25 , we have only modest limit on @xmath146 in such a regime .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that these are order of magnitude constraints , which may farther vary with other parameters , such as @xmath147 and @xmath27 .",
    "much better constraint plot is expected with the future _ glast _ data , where hopefully , @xmath15 will be measured for many individual bursts .    during the afterglow",
    "the synchrotron emission is much softer than during the prompt phase , and therefore , the ic component is expected to dominate egret observations also near its lower energy - band limit .",
    "moreover , the fact that the number of bursts detected by egret during the afterglow is higher than the number detected during the prompt emission suggests that here egret is likely to have detected the actual ic component of the afterglow .",
    "the spectral index of the gev afterglow in egret window during the first 200 s is expected to be @xmath1482 , implying that the evaluation of @xmath119 in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : mu_sig ] , which assumes a spectral index of @xmath114 , might be larger by at most a small factor ( @xmath323 ) .",
    "thus , for the afterglow , @xmath149@xmath150 .",
    "we then compare this result with the theoretical expectation of @xmath15 in equation  ( [ eq : eta_ic ] ) .",
    "but first we need to estimate the value of @xmath151 where @xmath18 is measured during the first 200 s following @xmath111 and @xmath110 is the prompt emission fluence .",
    "we use the _ swift _ grb table which provides x - ray afterglow fluences several tens to several hundreds of seconds after the bursts , as well as the prompt mev fluences . using only bursts where the x - ray observation starts after @xmath111 but no more than @xmath152 s after the burst we find a distribution of @xmath153 that ranges from @xmath117 to @xmath150 , with the central value of @xmath310@xmath154 .",
    "thus afterglow theory with canonical parameters predicts @xmath155 with a large spread , consistent with egret constraints .",
    "figure  [ fig : const](b ) shows the interpretation of egret constraint on @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mu_sig ] ) as that for @xmath146 and @xmath25 , assuming canonical parameters and @xmath156 .",
    "although this allowed region may change with other model parameters , again one can not have too large value of @xmath25 because of the klein - nishina suppression factor @xmath30 .",

    "first we estimate the sensitivity of lat on board _ glast _ for prompt and afterglow gev emission , based on its published sensitivity to steady point sources , which is @xmath163 @xmath63 s@xmath1 above 100 mev at @xmath164 with a power - law index of @xmath165 .",
    "this sensitivity is obtained by a one - year all - sky survey during which any point source is observed for @xmath370 d ( the lat field of view is 2.4 sr ) .",
    "therefore during the background - limited regime ( when @xmath166 is large enough that many background photons are observed ) the flux limit scale with @xmath166 as @xmath163 @xmath63 s@xmath1 @xmath167 . during the photon - count - limited regime (",
    "when @xmath166 is so small that less than one background photon is expected ) , in contrast , the detection limit is at a constant fluence .",
    "therefore the fluence sensitivity of the _ glast_-lat detector is @xmath168,\\\\      f_{\\rm lim } ( t_0 ) \\left(\\frac{t}{t_0}\\right)^{1/2 } & [ t > t_0 ] ,     \\end{array }    \\right .",

    "note that equation  ( [ eq : glast limit ] ) is for the limiting _ fluence _ , the time - integrated flux , rather than the flux .",
    "this limit is more natural in the photon - count - limited regime and it is more relevant to egret constraints that we derived in the previous section .",
    "detailed derivation of this sensitivity is given in appendix  [ app : glast ] . in table",

    ". we may find optimal low - frequency threshold depending on spectral index of grb emissions ; it is higher for harder spectrum .",
    "thus , we should be able to improve the fluence sensitivity for background - limited regime , compared with the figures given in table  [ table : glast ] .",
    "in addition , transition from photon - count to background limited regime would occur later than 650 s. for our purpose , however , as time scales we consider ( @xmath111 for prompt emission and 200 s after @xmath111 for afterglows ) are both during photon - count - limited regime , the consideration above does not apply and we can use full energy range ( 30 mev30 gev for egret ) to collect as many photons as possible .",
    "_ glast _ is also equipped with the glast burst monitor ( gbm ) instrument , dedicated for the detection of grbs .",
    "it detects photons of 8 kev to more than 25 mev and its field of view is @xmath38 sr .",
    "the expected rate of grbs that trigger gbm is @xmath3200 yr@xmath1 @xcite , which is almost as high as batse rate .",
    "each year , about 70 out of these @xmath3200 bursts should fall within the lat field of view .",
    "given the distribution of fluences ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dndf_egret ] ) and the lat sensitivity ( table  [ table : glast ] ) , we can estimate the fraction of grbs that would be detected with lat . in table",
    "[ table : result ] , we show the expected lat detection rate for @xmath183 , which is @xmath320 yr@xmath1 for the best - fit models of the egret data for both the prompt and afterglow emissions .",
    "the prompt phase estimates are for detections of the synchrotron component in the @xmath3100 mev range . given the large effective area of the lat it is expected also to detect @xmath184 gev photons from the ic component and identify the spectral break associated with the transition from the synchrotron to ic component , thereby directly testing the ssc model .",
    "the estimates given in table  [ table : result ] are fairly conservative .",
    "first , while we used five - photon criterion for the detection , even two - photon detection should be quite significant , because the expected background count is much smaller than one photon during @xmath111 and the following 200 s that we considered .",
    "second , _ swift _ can find dimmer bursts than gbm .",
    "although the discovery rate is not as high as that of gbm or batse , it would still be able to find tens of new grbs in the lat field of view .",

    "note that for the prompt phase , the fluence is that for synchrotron radiation , and that for ic component could be even larger ( see text).,width=325 ]    all the grbs except for those detected by egret should contribute to the egb flux to a certain extent @xcite .",

    "the factor @xmath189 takes into account the fact that very bright grbs can not contribute to the egb because they would be identified as point sources ( but see discussions below ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : egb_dist ] shows differential egb intensity @xmath190 that represents contribution from grbs of a given fluence , for prompt and afterglow phases . in the third column of table  [",
    "table : result ] , we show the egb intensity due to prompt and afterglow phases of grbs which is @xmath310@xmath191 gev @xmath63 s@xmath1 sr@xmath1 . on the other hand , in the same energy range",
    ", egret measured the egb flux to be @xmath192 gev @xmath63 s@xmath1 sr@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "therefore , grbs that were detected by batse but were not detected as point sources by egret contribute to the egb at least @xmath30.01% .",
    "again , we note that the estimates for the prompt phase are those of synchrotron component .",
    "we thus need to take the predicted ic contribution into account , which is represented by a correction factor @xmath193 in table  [ table : result ] . since this factor could be as large as @xmath310 according to the discussion in   [",
    "sec : constraint on high - energy emission with egret ] , egb flux due to prompt phase of grbs could also becomes @xmath310 times larger , which makes grb contribution as large as @xmath30.1% of the observations above @xmath3gev . in any case , the contributions from other astrophysical sources such as blazars are expected to be more significant than grbs ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "additional contribution to egb is expected from a large number of grbs that point away from us and therefore would not have been detected with batse .",
    "the emission from these bursts points towards us once the external shock decelerates @xcite .",
    "since the total gev energy emitted every decade of time during the afterglow is roughly constant , the contribution of these grbs to egb can be estimated by the gev emission of the bursts that were detected by batse .",
    "similar contribution is expected from bursts that points towards us but that are too faint to be detected by batse , if the grb luminosity function behaves as @xmath194 as suggested by the universal structured jet model ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see however @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the contribution of bursts that were not detected by batse to egb can be estimated by the afterglow fluence of the detected bursts , assuming no contribution from bursts with only an upper limit .",
    "this is a reasonable estimate since the gev flux is dominated by the few brightest bursts in gev which are the most likely to be detected . taking the fluence of the detected gev bursts as the logarithmic mean of these upper and lower limits implies @xmath195 gev @xmath63 s@xmath1 sr@xmath1 , a grb contribution being @xmath30.1% of the egb .",
    "finally , we note that there is a big uncertainty in removing the galactic foreground contamination from the total diffuse flux @xcite .",
    "additionally , egret observations do not constrain tev emission that cascades down into the gev range for grbs at cosmological distances @xcite . thus , if the foreground subtraction was indeed underestimated or if grb tev emission is not negligible , then grb contribution might be much more significant than the estimates here .",
    "the _ glast _ satellite would enable us to test high - energy emission mechanisms of grbs .",
    "if this emission will be found to be consistent with ssc then its observations would constrain physical parameters such as @xmath196 ratio and the bulk lorentz factor of the jet , @xmath197 . the egret instrument on board",
    "_ cgro _ , while less sensitive than the _ glast_-lat detector , identified several batse grbs with gev photons .",
    "in addition , stringent upper limits for @xmath3100 grbs were put on fluences in the gev band by analyzing the egret data @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we further extended this egret result , comparing with the ssc emission model .",
    "following theoretical models of ssc , we assumed that there is a linear correlation between fluences in batse and egret energy bands , and that the proportionality coefficient @xmath120 follows a log - normal distribution .",
    "we found that the predictions from the ssc model using canonical parameter values is fully consistent with egret fluence measurements and upper limits for both the prompt and afterglow phases . during the course of showing this result",
    ", we properly took the klein - nishina feedback effect into account in the theoretical calculation .",
    "the best - fit value of the coefficient was @xmath198 for both the prompt and afterglow emissions , and it is already stringent enough to test the ssc scenario .",
    "the limits for the prompt emission phase are for the synchrotron radiation , and thus if we consider the ic component as well , the value of @xmath120 could be larger by up to one order of magnitude .",
    "the obtained @xmath120 distribution , together with the batse fluence distribution , gives the expected fluence distribution in the gev band , which is shown in figure  [ fig : dndf_egret ] .",
    "as the _ glast_-lat detector covers egret energy band , we can predict the detectable number of grbs with _",
    "glast _ from the distribution of @xmath199 , given the _",

    "a detailed derivation as well as numerical approaches are given elsewhere ( nakar , ando , & sari , in preparation ) , but at least this equation can be understood qualitatively . for a given electron with lorentz factor @xmath25 , the synchrotron power does not depend on whether the klein - nishina suppression is effective or not . on the other hand ,",
    "the ic power does , because it is proportional to the energy density of seed ( synchrotron ) photons integrated up to some cutoff frequency ; synchrotron photons above this frequency can not be ic scattered efficiently by the electron with @xmath25 because of the klein - nishina suppression .",
    "the integrand of equation  ( [ eq : y ] ) represents the synchrotron spectrum .",

    "<S> we investigate the gev emission from gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , using the results from the energetic gamma ray experimental telescope ( egret ) , and in view of the _ gamma - ray large area space telescope ( glast)_. assuming that the conventional prompt and afterglow photons originate from synchrotron radiation , we compare an accompanying inverse - compton component with egret measurements and upper limits on gev fluence , taking klein - nishina feedback into account . </S>",
    "<S> we find that egret constraints are consistent with the theoretical framework of the synchrotron self - compton model for both prompt and afterglow phases , and discuss constraints on microphysical parameters in both phases . </S>",
    "<S> based on the inverse - compton model and using egret results , we predict that _ glast _ would detect grbs with gev photons at a rate @xmath0 yr@xmath1 from each of the prompt and afterglow phases . </S>",
    "<S> this rate applies to the high - energy tail of the prompt synchrotron emission and to the inverse - compton component of the afterglow . </S>",
    "<S> theory predicts that in a large fraction of the cases where synchrotron gev prompt emission would be detected by _ </S>",
    "<S> glast _ </S>",
    "<S> , inverse - compton photons should be detected as well at high energies ( @xmath2 gev ) . therefore _ </S>",
    "<S> glast _ will enable a more precise test of the high - energy emission mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that the contribution of grbs to the flux of the extragalactic gamma - ray background measured with egret is at least 0.01% and likely around 0.1% . </S>"
