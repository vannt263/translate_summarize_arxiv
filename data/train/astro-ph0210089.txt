    "i zw 18 ( mrk 116 ) represents an important local fiducial in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "it is a blue compact galaxy with the smallest known abundance of heavy elements in its ionized gas ( @xmath22% of solar ; v@xmath3lchez & isglesias - p@xmath4ramo 1998 and references therein ) . for the past three decades",
    ", the debate has focused on the age of its stellar populations .",
    "early analyses of wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) images suggested that star formation began several tens of myr ago ( dufour et al .",
    "1996 ; hunter & thronson 1995 ) , while later analyses of the same wfpc2 images ( aloisi , tosi , & greggio et al .",
    "1999 ) and new images from the near infrared camera and multiobject spectrometer ( @xmath5stlin 2000 ) implied the presence of an older population ( 0.51 gyr ) from a small number of faint red stars .",
    "two independent sets of ground - based observations have recently discovered wolf - rayet ( wr ) emission within the brighter ( nw ) component of i zw 18 : izotov et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found evidence for 17 wn and 5 wc stars , while legrand et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found evidence for 12 wc stars . while neither group had",
    "the spatial information to tie this emission to stellar clusters , the existence of wr stars in i zw 18 , especially of subtype wc , is surprising , because canonical ( non - rotating and non - binary ) evolutionary theory predicts few wn stars and no wc stars to form at the low metallicity of i zw 18 ( cervi@xmath6o & mas - hesse 1994 ; meynet 1995 ) .",
    "de mello et al .  ( 1998 ) subsequently searched for these wr stars in narrow - band wfpc2 images , and found faint peaks in the @xmath14686 emission they attributed to either nebular emission or 59 wn stars .    using the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , we recently obtained a two - dimensional far - uv spectroscopic map of i zw 18 , along with far - uv and near - uv images , in    @xmath7based on observations made with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope , obtained at the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
    ", under nasa contract nas 5 - 26555 .",
    "these observations are associated with proposal 9054 .",
    "order to further understand its star - formation history .",
    "these data reveal two clusters containing wc stars . while neither of these clusters is associated with the wr detections of legrand et al.(1997 ) and de mello et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , one of the clusters might be responsible for the wc emission seen by izotov et al .",
    "our stis data also provide a high - resolution map , based on the ly-@xmath8 absorption ; we show that the column depth ( @xmath9 ) is sharply peaked within the se component .",
    "we obtained far - uv spectra of i zw 18 from 2002 feb 9 to 2002 feb 12 , using the g140l grating and the @xmath10 slit on stis ( for a full description of the instrument , see woodgate et al.1998 and kimble et al .",
    "the field - of - view of the stis uv detectors is @xmath11 .",
    "we placed the slit at seven adjacent positions in i zw 18 , parallel to the axis of the main body ( position angle = 145@xmath12 ) , resulting in spatially resolved spectra of its bright star - forming regions ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the exposure time at four positions was 6058 s ( the central 3 positions and the sw extreme ) , while at the remaining three positions it was 5376 s. at each slit position , half the exposures were offset from the others by @xmath13 ( 20 pixels ) along the slit , in order to allow masking of bad , hot , and shadowed pixels in the coaddition , and to smooth over variations in the detector response .",
    "the spectra were processed through the standard calibration pipeline , except that we also subtracted an appropriately scaled profile of the dark rate , from a sum of 500 ks of dark exposures .",
    "the subtraction of this dark `` glow '' ( which peaks in the upper left - hand quadrant and can be 20 times higher than the nominal @xmath14 cts s@xmath15 pix@xmath15 dark rate ) is important when studying faint extended sources .",
    "finally , we subtracted the airglow spectrum using a region in each spectral image free from source flux .    on 2002 feb 25 , we also obtained far - uv and near - uv images of i zw 18 using the f25srf2 and f25qtz filters , respectively , with bandpasses centered at 1457    and 2365   , and exposure times of 5331 s and 5786 s. we again used @xmath13 offsets to allow masking of pixels and smoothing of detector response .",
    "all of the frames for each camera were coadded , rescaled , and shifted with the drizzle package in iraf , in order to match the g140l spectral images described above .",
    "in addition to our stis data , we also obtained archival wfpc2 images at longer wavelengths , in the f555w ( @xmath16 ) , f439w ( @xmath17 ) , f336w , and f469n ( @xmath18 ) filters , for comparison with earlier work .",
    "the wfpc2 data were cleaned of cosmic rays , coadded , and drizzled to register with the stis data .",
    "figure 1 shows a false color image produced from our stis data in the blue and green channels , and the wfpc2/f555w data in the red channel .    0.1 in    0.1 in",
    "the calstis pipeline software produces two - dimensional rectified spectral images that are useful for examining the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of extended objects .",
    "these images are linear in wavelength along the x - axis , and linear in spatial extent along the y - axis . upon examination of these images",
    ", we saw a compact source with obvious wr / wc emission      to find the locations of individual spectra in these images , we collapsed the spectra along the dispersion axis and convolved with a gaussian normalized to unit area and zero sum ( similar to the finding algorithm of the daophot package ; stetson 1987 ) .",
    "the local maxima in these convolutions gave the y - positions of compact sources along the slit .",
    "returning to the original spectral images , we extracted spectra at each of these positions , using row sums 5 pixels high .",
    "we also extracted spectra from the two regions with significant wr / wn detections in previous analyses of wfpc2 data ( de mello et al .",
    "1998 ; those not marked with `` ? '' in their table 3 ) , although these regions are not associated with compact sources in our spectral images , or with sources in the uv and optical hst images ( compare their figures 2 and 3@xmath22 ) .",
    "each spectrum was then shifted to account for the position of the object within the slit , using a centroid on the corresponding region in the far - uv image .    after extracting 205 spectra at the local maxima in our spectral images",
    ", we performed a systematic search for broad @xmath20 emission , using as a guide the spectrum of the source with obvious wr / wc features discussed above .",
    "we fit a linear continuum to each spectrum , using spectral regions free of strong emission and absorption features ( 14001500   , 15901620   , and 16701710   ) , summed the net flux exceeding this continuum in the region 16351665    ( the heliocentric velocity of i zw 18 is 751 km s@xmath15 ; thuan et al .",
    "1999 ) , and returned a list of @xmath23 detections of excess flux near 1640   .",
    "the automated search detected the obvious source we had already found by eye , plus one additional source of wr emission ; both spectra also show broad emission , indicating the presence of wc stars ( figure 1 , panels @xmath21 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "note that the emission lines are much broader than a resolution element in our spectra ( @xmath25    for point sources and @xmath26    for sources filling the slit ) .",
    "we also found two spectra with narrow emission features near 1640    that could be noise or nebular emission ; the spectra do not have emission , and their associated clusters are marked in figure 1@xmath27 ( yellow circles ) .",
    "our wc detections are located @xmath28 se and @xmath29 w of the center of the nw starforming region .",
    "legrand et al .  ( 1997 ) report wc emission @xmath30 sw of the central cluster , so our detections are distinct .",
    "izotov et al .",
    "( 1997 ) only restrict their detections of wr stars to the nw starforming region . none of the detections of wn stars by de mello et al .",
    "( 1998 ) correspond to the positions of our wc stars ; in figure 1@xmath31 and 1@xmath32 , we show spectra from the regions of their putative detections .    to estimate the number of wr / wc stars needed to produce the observed emission , we used the tabulations of schaerer & vacca ( 1998 ) . in the middle of the range of wc stars ,",
    "wc5 stars produce an average of luminosity of @xmath33 erg s@xmath15 . assuming a distance of 12.6 mpc ( @xmath5stlin 2000 ) and a foreground extinction of @xmath34  mag ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) but no reddening from the patchy internal dust ( cannon et al .",
    "2002 ) , we can convert our fluxes to luminosity . for the spectra shown in figure 1@xmath21 and 1@xmath24",
    ", we measure @xmath35 erg s@xmath15 and @xmath36 erg s@xmath15 , respectively , corresponding to 5@xmath37 and 6@xmath38 wr / wc stars . using the 1500    continuum flux and a 5  myr isochrone ( bertelli et al .  1994 ) , we estimate that these clusters contain 26 and 119 stars , respectively , with with @xmath398  @xmath40 , suggesting that the ratio wr/(wr+o ) in these clusters is respectively 0.2 and 0.05 .",
    "the stronger wr / wc detection in figure 1@xmath21 is due to the higher fraction of wr / wc stars in that cluster ; note the prominent and absorption in figure 1@xmath24 , where the hot underlying population of o stars is more dominant .",
    "our measured wr/(wr+o ) ratios fall within the range observed in other galaxies , but are unusually high given the metallicity of i zw 18 ( see maeder & meynet 1994 ) .",
    "of course , the ratio is far lower for the galaxy as a whole , given the many uv - bright clusters showing no wr emission .",
    "the ratio of to emission in figure 1@xmath21 is @xmath22.3 , which is typical for the wc subtype ( niedzielski & rochowicz 1994 ; gr@xmath41fener , koesterke , & hamann 2002 ) .",
    "however , this ratio is only @xmath42 in figure 1@xmath24 ; the smaller ratio is partly due to the absorption from the hot stellar population and interstellar medium , but it could also indicate that one or two of the wr stars in this cluster are of type wn instead of wc .",
    "de mello et al .",
    "( 1998 ) claimed detections of 1.5 and 3 wnl stars , respectively , where we are showing the spectra in figure 1@xmath31 and 1@xmath32 . assuming @xmath43 erg s@xmath15 ( schaerer & vacca 1996 )",
    ", individual wnl stars would be difficult to detect in our data , but we do not see any signs of these stars . where de mello et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found 1.5 wnl and 3 wnl stars , we formally find @xmath44 wnl stars and @xmath45 wnl stars , respectively .",
    "note that there are no point sources in our uv images ( or in the extant wfpc2 images ) at the locations of the de mello et al .",
    "detections , and de mello et al .",
    "note that their detections are consistent with both nebular or wr emission .",
    "unfortunately , their f469n image has a hot pixel exactly where we have our strongest detection of wr / wc emission , which probably precluded their detection of these sources .",
    "compared to the spectra in the nw half of i zw 18 , our spectra in the se half generally show broader ly-@xmath8 @xmath11216 absorption , but it is especially broad in one particular spectrum ( see figure 1@xmath22 ) . without other data ,",
    "the absorption could arise from two situations : either a high column density of interstellar , or a predominately older ( @xmath46 myr ) and cooler population of stars .",
    "we investigated this latter possibility by examining the sed with a longer wavelength baseline than that available in our far - uv spectra .",
    "note that if the spectrum in figure 1@xmath22 came from a 500 myr population , it would be have to be @xmath260 times more massive than the cluster shown figure 1@xmath24 .    using the hst images in the far - uv , near - uv , @xmath17 , and @xmath16 bands , we measured the flux in the region of our spectral extraction ( an area @xmath47 ) .",
    "this flux comes from a string of compact sources aligned with the long axis of the extraction box , so we estimated the aperture correction required by using tinytim models of the hst psf in the different bandpasses .",
    "we do not expect perfect agreement with the g140l spectrum ( due to wavelength - dependent aperture correction uncertainties in the images and spectrum ) , but they agree at the @xmath48% level ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is difficult to quantify exactly the dominant effective temperature of the stellar population , given the reddening uncertainties and the fact that we are looking in the rayleigh - jeans tail .",
    "however , the sed of this region is clearly dominated by a population of hot stars .",
    "we show this by integrating the synthetic spectra of kurucz ( 1993 ) over the isochrones of bertelli et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , for two different ages ( figure 2 ) .",
    "a population of about 500 myr ( or a single star of @xmath49  k ) is needed to explain the width of ly-@xmath8 absorption without a significant contribution from interstellar .",
    "however , such a population would produce far more flux at longer wavelengths than is actually seen . instead , a much younger population ( e.g. , 16  myr ) reddened by @xmath50 mag ( smc extinction law ; witt & gordon 2000 ) can reproduce the spectral energy distribution from the far - uv to the optical , but this requires that the ly-@xmath8 absorption come from a high column : @xmath51 atoms @xmath52 .",
    "this result is independent of the dominant @xmath53 in the underlying population , for @xmath54  k. the spectra show much narrower ly-@xmath8 absorption as one moves away from this position ; e.g. , looking along a sightline to a bright cluster 1@xmath55 to the se , the column must be at least ten times smaller ( with the exact amount depending upon the assumed age / temperature of the underlying population ) .",
    "van zee et al .  (",
    "1998 ) produced high spatial resolution ( 5@xmath55 ) maps of the distribution in i zw 18 , using the very large array ( vla ) , and found that the column density peaks in the se half of the galaxy at @xmath56 atoms @xmath52 .",
    "because each of the two starbursting regions ( nw and se ) subtends @xmath57 on the sky , a sharp peak in the distribution would be much smaller than a vla resolution element , and thus the column density could peak at a significantly larger value than the peak in the van zee et al.(1998 ) map .",
    "we have presented high spatial resolution images and spectra of the starburst galaxy i zw 18 .",
    "these spectra show strong wr / wc emission features originating in two compact clusters . from the @xmath11640 emission",
    ", we estimate that 6 wr / wc stars reside in a very uv - bright cluster situated well within the nw starbursting region , and that 5 wr / wc stars lie in a somewhat fainter cluster just outside of this region .",
    "the fact that any wr / wc stars exist at all in i zw 18 is surprising , because canonical theory for the evolution of single , massive , non - rotating stars predicts few wr stars and no wc stars to form at the low metallicity of i zw 18 ( meynet 1995 ; cervi@xmath6o & mas - hesse 1994 ) .",
    "the existence of wr / wc stars at the low metallicity of i  zw  18 demonstrates the importance of sophisticated models of massive star evolution .",
    "maeder & meynet ( 2001 ) find that the inclusion of rotation in their models decreases the minimum mass for a single star to become a wr star , allowing the formation of wr stars at lower metallicity .",
    "furthermore , there is both theoretical and observational evidence for the importance of close binary evolution in the formation of wr stars , especially as one moves to lower metallicity ( see bartzakos , moffat , & niemela 2001 ) ; the role of binaries in wr formation has a long history ( see paczy@xmath58ski 1967 ) , even though much of the wr literature focuses on single - star evolution .",
    "our data also show a sharp peak in the column density of i zw 18 , situated within the se half of the galaxy .",
    "this peak falls within the peak of previous high spatial resolution maps of the taken with the vla ( van zee et al .",
    ". however , our measurement of 2@xmath59 atoms @xmath52 exceeds the earlier estimates by an order of magnitude , because of the higher resolution in our hst data .    support for proposal 9054 was provided by nasa through a grant from the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
