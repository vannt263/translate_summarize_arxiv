    "the interest in shape memory alloys has been driven by the enormous potential these materials represent in various fields ranging from medicine @xcite to robotics @xcite to aeronautics @xcite .",
    "this is because one has a diffusionless structural transition which involves the rearrangement of the position of the atoms in the solid .",
    "this process is entirely reversible and has been the driving force in using shape memory alloys in wide ranging applications .",
    "the microscopic mechanism that drives the transition is therefore of interest which would help us to identify which materials would undergo this martensitic structural transition ( mst ) .",
    "fermi surface nesting @xcite and soft phonon modes @xcite have often been invoked to explain the mst , with the microscopic origin usually being associated with a band jahn teller effect @xcite .",
    "these reasons however do not seem to be valid across all systems .",
    "examples among heusler alloys are seen , where inspite of a soft phonon mode being found in the calculations , no mst has been observed @xcite .",
    "we consider the example of compounds given by ni@xmath0mn@xmath1sn@xmath2 .",
    "the unusual feature of this class of compounds is that the martensitic transition is seen only for off - stoichiometric compositions where @xmath3 ranges from 0.36 to 0.80 in contrast to other martensites such as ni@xmath0mnga where the transition is seen for stoichiometric members .",
    "the martensitic transition in ni@xmath0mnga has been explained by jahn - teller effects @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the usual explanation offered in the case of ni@xmath0mn@xmath1sn@xmath2 is the increased hybridization between the ni and mn @xmath4 states being responsible for the observed martensitic transition @xcite .",
    "this effect should be present in the stoichiometric composition also , and these ideas do not explain why one does nt have a martensitic transition there .    in the present work we consider several compositions of ni@xmath0mn@xmath1sn@xmath2 .",
    "our calculations find a transition for @xmath3 = 0.375 , 0.50 , 0.625 , 0.75 and 0.875 , but find no transition for @xmath3 = 0.0 and 0.25 , consistent with experiment .",
    "as our calculations are able to capture the experimental trend , we went on to examine the microscopic origin of the transition .",
    "considering the @xmath3 = 0.50 composition , we have calculated the band structure and fit this to a microscopic tight binding model .",
    "this analysis was performed for the cubic structure as well as the martensitic structure and allows us to quantify the changes in the electronic structure .",
    "if the origin was jahn - teller distortions , one expects a change in the onsite energies as a result of the distortion .",
    "one however finds very small changes indicating that we must discard this model .",
    "short mn - ni ( mn1-ni ) bonds equal to 2.624    are found in the parent compound ni@xmath0mnsn .",
    "when mn replaces sn atoms ( referred to as mn2 ) one has the same mn2-ni bondlength in the unrelaxed structure .",
    "however it is found that the system lowers its energy with ni atoms moving towards the mn2 atoms while there is a smaller decrease in the ni - mn1 bondlength .",
    "this seems surprising at first as all mn - sn bondlengths are the same to start with and so are the bondangles leading to similar matrix elements for the hopping between mn and ni .",
    "this is traced to the fact that while the exchange splitting on mn1 and ni are in the same direction , that on mn2 is opposite .",
    "this results in a larger energy gain when mn2 and ni interact . at larger doping concentrations one gains energy from mn1 and ni interactions also .",
    "the increased mn - ni hybridization is not the driving force of the martensitic transition as , at @xmath3 = 0.25 one has shortened bonds , but no martensitic transition . as @xmath3 is increased , the interactions between mn2 and the neighboring mn1 leads to substantial deviation from a perfectly @xmath5 character on mn1 that one finds otherwise .",
    "this then allows for energy gain from mn1-ni hybridization also .",
    "so a ni atom moves towards both mn1 and mn2 and this is achieved by moving along the resultant force which is along a lattice parameter .",
    "further energy lowering is possible by an elongation of that lattice parameters which results in the martensitic transition .",
    "the question that follows is why would the ni atom move towards some of its neighbours over a centrosymmetric situation .",
    "this is traced to the presence of the lone pair on sn .",
    "the system gains energy with ni moving away from the sn atoms resulting in reduced repulsion felt by the electrons on ni from those on sn .",
    "hence a combination of mn - ni enhanced hybridization and reduced repulsion from the lone pair on sn drive the martensitic transition .",
    "the lone pair electrons are not only present in sn , but are also present in other elements like in and sb .",
    "so , the mechanism proposed here should be valid for those systems also .",
    "_ ab - initio _ electronic structure calculations are carried out using density functional theory ( dft ) as implemented in the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite .",
    "we use the projected augmented wave implementation and work with the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) perdew - wang @xcite for the exchange correlation functional .",
    "this has been seen to give a better description of the magnetism in heusler compounds @xcite and we also see 22 - 24% enhanced magnetic moments in our gga calculations compared to the lda calculations . in off - stoichiometric ni@xmath0mn@xmath1sn@xmath2 (",
    "@xmath3 = 0.25 , 0.375 , 0.50 , 0.625 , 0.75 , 0.875 ) the mn at parent site is labelled mn1 while the mn doped at sn site has been labelled mn2 .",
    "the magnetic interaction between mn1 and mn2 is antiferromagnetic , while that between ni and mn1 is ferromagnetic .",

    "the lattice parameters of the unit cell as well as the ionic positions have been optimised in each of the cases considered and the optimised value is mentioned in the text .",
    "an analysis of the electronic structure has been carried out in terms of the band dispersions as well as the partial density of states ( pdos ) calculated using spheres of radii @xmath7 1.3    around each atom .",
    "the magnetic moments have been reported within the same spheres .",
    "additionally an analysis of the electronic structure has been carried out using an interface of vasp to wannier90 @xcite . a basis consisting of ni @xmath8 and @xmath4 , mn @xmath8 and @xmath4 as well as sn @xmath9 states .",
    "a mapping of the bloch states is made onto wannier functions , localized on the respective atoms with their angular parts given by the relevant spherical harmonics , via a unitary transformation .",
    "a unique transformation is obtained with the requirement of minimizing the quadratic spread of the wannier functions .",
    "the criterion of convergence was that the spread changed by less than 10@xmath10 between successive iterations .",
    "once the transformation matrices are determined , one has a tight binding representation of the hamiltonian in the basis of the maximally localized wannier functions .",
    "the experimentally reported unit cell of ni@xmath0mnsn is cubic with a lattice parameter of 6.05 @xcite . carrying out an optimization of the lattice parameter within our calculations ,",
    "the theoretical lattice parameter is found to be 6.06    and the structure remains cubic .",
    "the distances between ni and mn as well as between ni and sn are found to be 2.62  .",
    "in contrast to what we find in ni@xmath0mnsn , ni@xmath0mnga is found to undergo a structural transformation and favors a tetragonal phase at low temperature .",
    "this suggests that an important role is played by the p - element in inducing the martensitic transformation . in order to understand this",
    "further we examine the atom and orbital projected partial density of states .",
    "this is shown in fig .",

    "the fermi energy e@xmath11 is at 0 ev.,width=415,height=302 ]    ni @xmath4 states are found to contribute in the energy window -4 to 2 ev , which is also the energy window in which mn 3@xmath4 states contribute .",
    "sn 5@xmath9 states are found to have a low weight in the same energy window .",
    "sn 5@xmath8 states are localized and are found to contribute -8 to -10 ev below the fermi level , with low weight in the unoccupied part .",
    "these states have been referred to as lone pair states as they are not involved in any bonding with the neighboring atoms .",
    "this indicates that the electronic structure of ni@xmath0mnsn emerges from the bonding of the ni 3@xmath4 and mn 3@xmath4 states .",
    "examining the mn @xmath4 pdos , one finds that the majority spin states are completely filled while the minority spin states are empty , indicating a @xmath5 configuration at the mn site .",
    "the exchange splitting of the mn @xmath4 states and the ni @xmath4 states are found to be in the same direction .",
    "now when one of the sn atoms is replaced by mn , corresponding to the composition ni@xmath0mn@xmath12sn@xmath13 , we find that despite allowing for changes in the cell shape upon optimization , the structure remains cubic .",
    "the optimized lattice constant is found to 5.99    as against 6.06    that was found for the parent compound .",
    "the absence of a tetragonal transition at this composition , which is usually associated with the existence of a martensitic transition , is consistent with experiment .",
    "there is also a volume contraction found when we replace sn with mn .",
    "this is expected as the ionic radius of mn is smaller than that of sn .",
    "the bond lengths between ni - mn1 , ni - mn2 and ni - sn are found to be 2.57   , 2.52    and 2.62    as against the bondlengths of 2.59    found before the atomic relaxations .",
    "there is a reduction in the ni - mn bondlengths , with a larger reduction in the ni - mn2 bondlengths .",
    "we then consider the composition @xmath3 = 0.375 in the formula ni@xmath0mn@xmath1sn@xmath2 .",
    "this is close to the composition @xmath3 = 0.36 at which point one finds the onset of the martensitic transitions in experiment .",
    "this can be realized in a 32 atom supercell .",
    "starting with a cubic unit cell one finds that a tetragonal unit cell is favored at the end of the unit cell optimization with lattice parameters @xmath14 6.83  , @xmath15 = 5.55  , resulting in a tetragonality @xmath16 1.23 .",
    "however , the tetragonality reported in experiment @xcite is @xmath7 1.10 .",
    "this might be due to structural disorder which are not accounted for in the theoretical calculation .",
    "the difference in the lattice parameters by gga based dft and the experiment has been also reported for ni - mn - ga system @xcite .",
    "moreover , one finds a reduction in some of the ni - mn bond lengths .",
    "these are found to be in the range 2.50 - 2.64    for ni - mn1 , 2.53 - 2.54    for ni - mn2 .",
    "additionally there is a substantial increase of the ni - sn bond lengths from the stoichiometric compound .",
    "the question that follows is whether this aids the tetragonality and how .",
    "understanding this would help us to explain the observed martensitic phase transition .",
    "= 0.25 , 0.375 and 0.50 of ni@xmath0mn@xmath1sn@xmath2 . the direction of magnetic moment on each atom has been indicated by arrow.,width=604,height=491 ]",
    "we then continue the discussion by considering the composition @xmath3 = 0.50 . here",
    "again one finds that there is a reduction in ni - mn1 and ni - mn2 bond lengths .",
    "additionally there is a tetragonal unit cell which is found to be favored for different combinations of @xmath3 = 0.50 which is the indicator of the martensitic transition .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , fully relaxed crystal structures of initial cubic structure of composition @xmath3 = 0.25 , 0.375 and 0.50 of ni@xmath0mn@xmath1sn@xmath2 have been shown . in each case",
    "the optimized ni - mn1 and ni - mn2 bond lengths have been indicated .",
    "examining the structures closely , we can identify a pattern that emerges in the relaxations .",
    "ni atoms are found to move towards mn2 atoms , with their bondlengths with sn increasing .",
    "their movement towards mn1 atoms is less though at larger concentrations they move towards those mn1 atoms which are nearest neighbors of mn2 .",
    "this is consistent with extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) measurements of ni@xmath0mn@xmath17sn@xmath18 @xcite where one finds that ni - mn bond lengths decrease upon martensitic transformation . in the low temperature martensitic phase in the case of ni k - edge , ni - mn and ni - sn bond lengths are 2.569    and 2.607    changing from 2.595 ",
    "this seems surprising at first and the question we ask next is what are the underlying energetics that dictate the ni movement . at @xmath3",
    "= 0.25 we find that both mn1 and mn2 have an almost @xmath5 configuration though their exchange splittings are opposite in direction .",
    "this results in stronger hybridization between ni and mn2 atoms , compared to that with mn1 .",
    "this is the reason the ni atom moves towards mn2 .",
    "as @xmath3 is increased , one has mn1 and mn2 atoms occupying nearest neighbor sites .",
    "they interact with each other and as a result one finds a deviation of mn1 from a @xmath5 configuration found at @xmath3 = 0.25 .",
    "this results in a smaller moment on those mn1 atoms which are closer to mn2 and is found to be 3.383 @xmath19 as against 3.486 @xmath19 for the stoichiometric ni@xmath0mnsn .",
    "now one finds that ni atoms can gain energy from interactions with both mn1 ( only the low moment atoms ) and mn2 .",
    "this is what we find for @xmath3 = 0.375 and beyond .",
    "the ni atoms move towards both mn1 and mn2 .",
    "the resultant movement is along a lattice parameter .",
    "hence in each case one finds that the lattice parameter increases along the direction of movement and there is further lowering of energy .",
    "the natural question that follows is why does the ni atom move away from a centro - symmetric position towards the mn atoms .    in each of the structures shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , one finds that the movement of the ni atoms is away from the sn atoms .",
    "the reason for this is apparent when we plot the line profile of the sn 5@xmath8 charge density along the sn - mn and sn - ni bonds of ni@xmath0mnsn in fig [ fig3 ] .",
    "states along the sn - mn and sn - ni bond .",
    "the respective bondlengths are indicated in parentheses.,width=415,height=264 ]    the chosen mn atom is further away and is at 3.03    from the sn atom .",
    "however , the ni atom is at 2.62    from the sn atom .",
    "if there were strong covalent interactions between the ni and sn atoms , one would expect the charge density to be more delocalized along the bond .",
    "instead we find that the charge density is more localized along the sn - ni bond than along the sn - mn bond , the spread reflecting the increased separation of the pair of atoms .",
    "this verifies that the driving force of the distortions is additionally the repulsion the electrons on ni face from those on sn .    an alternate explanation for the martensitic transition that has been offered has been the band jahn teller effect .",
    "the idea is that jahn teller distortions lift the degeneracy of the @xmath4 orbitals .",
    "this is aided by tetragonality and hence the conclusion that jahn - teller distortions drive the martensitic transition . in order to quantify this",
    "we map the _ ab - initio _ band dispersions for @xmath3 = 0.50 to a tight binding model which included @xmath8 and @xmath4 orbital states of ni and mn and @xmath9 orbital states of sn in the basis .",
    "maximally localized wannier functions were considered for the radial parts of the wavefunction .",
    "the tight - binding bands are superposed on the _ ab - initio _ bands of unstable cubic and fully relaxed tetragonal structure in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "mn@xmath20sn@xmath21 in the ( a ) cubic and the ( b ) fully relaxed tetragonal phase.,width=302,height=453 ]    in both cases , one finds an excellent mapping of the _ ab - initio _ band structure within the tight - binding model .",
    "the relative on - site energy of ni d states with respect to @xmath22 spin up state are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the changes one finds in the energies are small .",
    "this suggests that jahn - teller distortions can not be the driving force for the martensitic transitions seen in this system .",
    "[ table1 ]    it is important to note that in the spin down channel reduced exchange splitting is possibly due to transfer of charge to ni atoms .",
    "this might be from sn @xmath8 states .",
    "thus our analysis reveals that the lone pair effect of sn 5@xmath8 electrons is the main triggering factor for additional tetragonality .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the structural properties of ni@xmath0mn@xmath1sn@xmath2 by means of _ ab - initio _ density functional theory .",
    "we have obtained martensitic transformation for @xmath23 0.375 which is in good agreement with the experimental value of @xmath23 0.36 .",
    "the relative on - site energies of ni @xmath4 states in cubic and fully relaxed tetragonal structure of ni@xmath0mn@xmath20sn@xmath21 reveals that the changes in the energies are very small and that the jahn - teller effect can not be the driving force for the martensitic transitions seen in this system .",
    "it is the ni - mn hybridization and sn lone pair effect on ni which makes the cubic structure unstable and triggers the structural transformation for ni - mn - sn systems .",
