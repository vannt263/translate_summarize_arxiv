    "recent advances in numerical general relativity quantified how the coalescence of unequal black hole binaries leads to the anisotropic emission of gravitational radiation , which can carry enough linear momentum to deliver a substantial kick to the merged black hole ( pretorius 2005 , baker et al .",
    "2006 , campanelli et al . 2006 ) . because the inspiral and eventual coalescence of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) is a frequent consequence of galaxy mergers ,",
    "it is expected that smbh recoil will often accompany these events .",
    "the magnitude of the recoil varies as a function of the initial mass ratio and the spin and orbital angular momentum vectors of the coalescing black holes , but is generally of order hundreds of kilometers per second ( schnittman & buonanno 2008 , lousto et al .",
    "2010 ) . at the high end of the velocity distribution ,",
    "the black hole can recoil with a velocity @xmath3 and escape the merged galaxy .",
    "more commonly , it will oscillate for a time ranging from @xmath4 - @xmath5 ( blecha & loeb 2008 , sijacki et al .",
    "2010 , blecha et al . 2010 ) before settling down into the galaxy s center .",
    "observation of a recoiling smbh would be of interest both as a probe of hierarchical galaxy evolution and as a test of the predictions of strong field general relativity .",
    "consequently , several papers have focused on observational signatures of a recoiling smbh .",
    "a black hole kicked at a substantial fraction of its host galaxy s escape velocity can create or expand a low - density stellar core ( gualandris & merritt , 2008 ) .",
    "the small cloud of stars gravitationally bound to the recoiling black hole would appear like a globular cluster , but with much higher velocity dispersion ( oleary & loeb 2009 , merritt et al .",
    "2009 , oleary & loeb 2011 ) .",
    "gas accretion onto the black hole , manifested as a spatially or kinematically offset quasar ( madau & quataert 2004 , loeb 2007 ) , is potentially a very clear signature , but the gas reservoir bound to the black hole will be depleted within @xmath6 years after ejection from the center of its galaxy ( blecha & loeb 2008 , blecha et al .",
    "several candidates have already been detected with this last method ( komossa et al .",
    "2008 , shields et al .",
    "2009 , civano et al .",
    "2010 ) , although the evidence for black hole recoil is not conclusive ( bogdanovic et al .",
    "a potentially longer - lived source of accretion power is the tidally disrupted matter from stars passing too close to the recoiling black hole , which could be visible as an off - center tidal disruption flare . because tidal disruption flare lightcurves have , in principle , several unique identifiers ( strubbe & quataert 2009 , guillochon et al .",
    "2009 , kasen & ramirez - ruiz 2010 , strubbe & quataert 2010 ) , an off - center or intergalactic tidal disruption flare would be a very strong indication of a recoiling black hole .",
    "this scenario was first investigated in a paper by komossa & merritt ( 2008 , hereafter km08 ) . however , to evaluate the utility of tidal disruption signatures for recoiling black holes it is first necessary to obtain estimates for the tidal disruption rates produced by these systems .",
    "km08 calculate these rates for relatively large kick velocities , while in this paper we generalize the calculation to cover realistic , and often moderate , kick velocity distributions .",
    "the aim of these calculations is to approximate the frequency of off - center and spectrally shifted tidal disruption flares , to determine if tidal disruption events ( tdes ) are useful probes of physically motivated kick velocity distributions .",
    "these rate calculations are also relevant to smbhs ejected from galaxy centers in triple - smbh interactions ( hoffman & loeb 2007 ) , although we do not attempt to evaluate the more complicated distributions of parameters for such events .    very large increases in tidal disruption rates have been discussed previously in the context of galaxy mergers , both as a prompt electromagnetic signal immediately following smbh coalescence ( stone & loeb 2010 ) , and due to resonances or chaotic stellar orbits at the end of the dynamical friction phase of an smbh binary ( ivanov et al .",
    "2005 , chen et al .",
    "2009 , wegg & bode 2010 , chen et al .",
    "neither of these mechanisms is capable of producing a tidal disruption flare with an observable spatial offset , as both can only occur in galactic nuclei .",
    "tidal flares produced by wider smbh binaries could still be a source of confusion in interpreting spatially offset tdes , however .",
    "binary - produced flares would themselves be of interest , but would not be directly useful for testing predictions of gravitational wave recoil . distinguishing between the two possibilities will be simple in some cases : for instance , a tde in intergalactic space , independent of an observable stellar population , would likely be due to a recoiling black hole ; whereas a tde with periodic interruptions in its lightcurve ( liu et al .",
    "2009 ) would be due to a hard smbh binary .",
    "however , in many cases it will be not be trivial to disentangle the two causes , and detailed observation and modeling of the host galaxy could be necessary to determine if it is likely to harbor a binary smbh at the observed spatial or kinematic offset",
    ". a final source of confusion could be disruption of stars by imbhs left over in a galaxy s halo from earlier stages of hierarchical growth ( oleary & loeb 2011 )",
    ". however , these tdes would probably be distinguishable due to their low black hole masses , and in any event would be a complementary example of black hole recoil .    although the current sample of observed tdes is small , with roughly a dozen strong candidates ( gezari et al .",
    "2009 ) , current and upcoming time - domain optical transient surveys such as pan - starrs , ptf , and lsst are expected to increase that sample by @xmath7 orders of magnitude ( strubbe & quataert 2009 ) , making it profitable to study sub - populations of tdes .",
    "if sufficiently large , the subset of disruption flares associated with recoiling black holes could be used to constrain the lisa event rate or the distribution of kick velocities associated with astrophysical smbh mergers ; at the very least , detection of this subset of tdes could qualitatively confirm recent numerical relativity predictions .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we develop the model used to estimate the tde rate over a wide range of kick velocities and galaxy parameters , and in  3 we explain in more detail the distributions of disruption properties we integrate over . in ",
    "4 we discuss the results of our modeling , and in  5 we offer our conclusions on the viability of tidal disruption flares as a technique for identifying recoiled smbhs .",
    "the three primary quantities to be calculated are the trajectory of the kicked black hole through its host galaxy , the rate at which it disrupts unbound stars that it encounters , and the rate at which it depletes its cloud of gravitationally bound stars via tidal disruption .",
    "the location ( and possible kinematic offset ) of a disruption event relative to its host galaxy will determine whether the flare can be distinguished from a tde due to a stationary black hole . ",
    "2.1 examines expected ranges of black hole kicks ,  2.2 discusses the relevant tidal disruption physics ,  2.3 lays out the galaxy parametrization used in this paper , and  2.4 and  2.5 describe the techniques used to estimate tde rates for unbound and bound stars , respectively . finally , in  2.6 we discuss observational constraints .",
    "our general strategy is as follows : strubbe & quataert 2009 ( hereafter sq09 ) calculate the number of tdes a generic survey would be expected to detect , binned by black hole mass ( see sq09 figures 9 , 13 ) . in this calculation",
    "they assume a time - averaged tidal disruption rate @xmath8 .",
    "our model averages over a kick velocity distribution and a range of galaxy parameters ( detailed in  2.3 ) to calculate a @xmath9 dependent on black hole mass , and then modifies the sq09 survey calculations accordingly .",
    "the gravitational recoil velocity of a post - merger smbh depends only on the mass ratio , spin amplitudes , and spin orientations ( relative to the orbital angular momentum plane ) of the two progenitor smbhs .",
    "the merger of schwarzschild black holes represents a simple case , with a maximum kick velocity of @xmath10175 @xmath11 occurring at a mass ratio of 0.36 ( gonzalez et al .",
    "2007 ) . as the dimensionless spin parameters of the two smbhs @xmath12 , @xmath13 increase",
    ", so does the maximum kick velocity @xmath14 , although it has complicated functional dependences on the relative inclination of the pre - merger spin axes and the orbital angular momentum axis .",
    "an exact calculation requires the full framework of numerical relativity , but analytic fitting formulae can be calibrated to numerical relativity results , recently yielding quite high accuracy ( lousto et al .",
    "although certain combinations of smbh binary initial parameters can produce kicks up to @xmath15 ( campanelli et al .",
    "2006 ) , observation constrains how frequent such high - velocity kicks can be , due to the fact that galaxies with bulges all seem to possess central smbhs ( ferrarese & ford 2005 , blecha et al .",
    "this constraint is weakened , however , by the hierarchical nature of structure formation ( schnittman 2007 ) .",
    "higher velocity kicks become more important if one assumes high values of pre - merger spin amplitudes : lousto et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found 23% of their monte carlo sample to exceed @xmath16 by assuming all pre - merger spin amplitudes @xmath17 ( with isotropic distribution of spin angles ) , and mass ratios @xmath18 between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "spins of this magnitude are likely realistic for a nontrivial fraction of astrophysical black holes : the fe @xmath21 line has implied a near - maximally spinning smbh candidate ( brenneman & reynolds 2006 ) . however , there is reason to believe that the spins of merging black holes may align during the inspiral phase ( bogdanovic et al .",
    "2007 ) in the case of gas - rich mergers .",
    "this has the potential to strongly suppress high - velocity kicks relative to an isotropic spin distribution ( but see king et al .",
    "2005 and lodato & pringle 2006 for a description of how counter - alignment , which does not suppress @xmath14 as strongly , can also occur ) .",
    "dotti et al .",
    "( 2009 ) find a dramatic reduction , with median kick velocities below @xmath22 , although their scenario investigates the specific case where @xmath18 is very near 1 , while we are concerned with a wider range of mass ratios .",
    "their results also indicate that cooler gas accretion ( adiabatic index @xmath23 ) more effectively aligns spins and suppresses kicks than a warmer ( @xmath24 ) accretion flow .",
    "more recently , it was discovered that even in gas - free mergers , relativistic spin precession is capable of aligning or anti - aligning progenitor smbh spin vectors , and reducing median kick velocities ( kesden et al .",
    "consideration of all these factors highlights the need to generalize the work of km08 to a more realistic distribution of kick velocities , as recoil velocities in excess of galactic escape speed are likely to be uncommon even if smbh spins are near - maximal and unaligned .    because the real distribution of kick velocities depends on the smbh spin distribution and the uncertain physics of the last stages of smbh merger , we calculate black hole trajectories given kicks of @xmath25 , and @xmath26 @xmath27 , and then interpolate quantities of interest such as wandering lifetime and time - averaged tidal disruption rates .",
    "we then fit these functions of @xmath14 to plausible black hole kick distributions .",
    "in particular , we consider the three @xmath14 distributions in figure 2 of lousto et al .",
    "2010 , which assume isotropic pre - merger spins , spins aligned to within @xmath28 degrees , and spins aligned to within @xmath29 degrees ( dry mergers , hot wet mergers , and cold wet mergers , respectively ) .",
    "these scenarios assume a @xmath18 uniformly sampled between 0 and 1 .",
    "the dry merger scenario assumes spin magnitudes randomly sampled between 0 and 0.9 , while the wet mergers assume spin magnitudes between 0.3 and 0.9 . in reality",
    ", the distribution of spin amplitudes also depends on factors not considered ; chiefly , relativistic spin precession ( kesden et al . 2010 ) and chaotic versus standard accretion ( berti & volonteri 2008 ) .",
    "likewise , modeling smbh merger histories and spin evolution using the press - schechter formalism indicates a top - heavy spin distribution and a bottom heavy @xmath18 distribution ( volonteri et al 2004 ) .",
    "we leave more complicated @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath18 distributions to future research , although the kick distributions we consider should bracket a wide range of the available parameter space .",
    "stars that pass within a radius @xmath30 of a smbh will be tidally disrupted . in this equation @xmath31",
    "is the black hole mass , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the stellar mass and radius , and @xmath34 is a stellar structure constant which is of order unity for main sequence stars .",
    "detailed calculations find @xmath35 for @xmath36 polytropes , for example ( diener et al .",
    "1995 ) . during the disruption event ,",
    "roughly one half of the stellar mass is ejected from the system , while the other half remains bound ( rees 1988 ) but with the change in gravitational potential across the star producing a wide spread of specific orbital energies , @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the pericenter distance of the star on its orbit around the black hole .",
    "the bound stellar matter quickly expands to the point where hydrodynamic forces can be neglected and the gas follows roughly keplerian trajectories , but upon return to pericenter the gas streams dissipate energy in shocks and form an accreting torus .",
    "the characteristic mass return rate is @xmath39 ( phinney 1989 ) , with the return time for the most tightly bound debris being @xmath40 ( sq09 ) .",
    "this simple dynamical picture has been confirmed as largely accurate by numerical hydrodynamic simulations ( evans & kochanek 1989 ) .",
    "the radiative properties of the flare have been modeled by loeb & ulmer ( 1997 ) , and most recently by sq09 , whose model finds that mass infall rates can exceed the eddington limit for days to months after disruption .",
    "this super - eddington phase may produce an outflow with supernova - like optical luminosities .",
    "after super - eddington infall ceases , emission is dominated by a thermal component from the accretion disk , which also photoionizes the unbound stellar debris , producing broad emission lines .",
    "luminosity from the disk fades with a decay time of order months to years , and is peaked in the uv and soft x - ray .",
    "upcoming transient surveys will dramatically expand the number of tdes available for study , with the pan - starrs @xmath41 survey expected to find @xmath42 per year , rising to @xmath43 if the sq09 predictions about super - eddington outflows are correct .",
    "lsst is expected to find @xmath44 per year , or up to @xmath45 if the hypothesized super - eddington outflows can be seen . in this paper",
    "we consider a black hole mass range from @xmath46 to @xmath47 . for @xmath48",
    "the schwarzschild radius of a black hole exceeds the tidal disruption radius of main sequence stars , meaning that stars will be swallowed whole rather than disrupted by non - spinning smbhs .",
    "however , for a kerr black hole @xmath49 is angle - dependent , and for high values of spin , black holes as large as @xmath50 can still tidally disrupt main sequence stars which approach from angles near the equatorial plane ( beloborodov et al .",
    "1992 ) . for simplicity",
    "we consider smbhs up to but not above @xmath47 .    in this paper",
    "we follow the prescriptions of sq09 and strubbe & quataert 2010 for disk and super - eddington outflow luminosity . specifically , we model the super - eddington outflow as a sphere with photosphere radius @xmath51 photosphere temperature @xmath52 and time of peak emission equal to the larger of @xmath53 and the time when the outer edge of the photosphere becomes optically thin , @xmath54 here the outflowing wind velocity is given by @xmath55 with @xmath56 a free parameter of fiducial value @xmath19 , and the total mass flux in the outflow is @xmath57 with @xmath58 a parameter taken to be @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 is the smbh s eddington - limited mass accretion rate assuming an accretion efficiency of @xmath59 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "again following sq09 , we approximate the disk as a geometrically slim multicolor blackbody extending from the innermost stable circular orbit , @xmath64 , to @xmath65 . its temperature profile is given by @xmath66 with @xmath67 , and @xmath64 a function of black hole spin .",
    "the existence of suitable emission or absorption lines for kinematic identification of a recoiling tde is an open question .",
    "there is widespread agreement in the literature on the existence of emission lines in the immediately unbound , photoionized stellar debris ( bogdanovic et al . 2004 , strubbe & quataert 2009 , strubbe & quataert 2010 ) .",
    "some of these spectral features are potentially useful for distinguishing tdes from supernovae and other transients ( kasen & ramirez - ruiz 2010 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the velocity spread in this debris , @xmath68 , can easily reach a large fraction of the speed of light , and details of the doppler broadening will be determined by the inclination of the star s initial orbit around the black hole , among other unknown parameters .",
    "a more promising candidate seems to be absorption lines formed when outflowing material processes continuum radiation from the accretion disk around the black hole ( strubbe & quataert 2010 ) .",
    "most of these lines are in the uv part of the spectrum , although weaker hydrogen or helium lines may exist in optical bands , and the presence of a soft x - ray , power law tail ( as has been observed in tidal flares detected by rosat and galex - see komossa 2002 , gezari et al .",
    "2008 ) could produce absorption lines between 1 and 10 kev as well ( strubbe & quataert 2010 ) .",
    "if the wind launching speed does not vary too much in time , these lines will be sufficiently narrow ( with thermal broadening @xmath69 ) to make the velocity difference between the outflowing wind s photosphere and the host galaxy measurable .",
    "however , the bulk outflow velocity may itself be quite large , in which case determination of the black hole velocity would require extremely precise wind modeling . alternatively , if @xmath70 , a recoiling black hole s",
    "velocity could dominate the kinematic offset between the photosphere and the galaxy , and make wind launching speed variations small .",
    "a limiting case of this regime is a different model for the super - eddington phase of mass return ( loeb & ulmer 1997 ) , in which radiation pressure from the disk isotropizes returning gas streams and supports a quasi - spherical cloud of disrupted matter . in this model , measurement of the absorption offset from host galaxy lines would precisely identify which tdes were caused by recoiling black holes .",
    "although the validity of either of these models is at the moment unclear , recent observations of tdes found in sdss data ( van velzen et al .",
    "2010 ) may be more compatible with the predictions of loeb & ulmer 1997 .",
    "further validation of this model ( or a low @xmath56 version of sq09 ) would indicate the feasibility of kinematic identification of recoil - induced tdes .    for a recoiling smbh , there are two sources of stars to tidally disrupt : unbound stars encountered in its passage through the host galaxy , and the small cloud of stars in orbits that remained bound during the recoil event .",
    "both of these sources are considered in the next subsections . for simplicity ,",
    "in the remainder of this paper we set @xmath71 , and @xmath72 ( a conservative assumption - see tremaine & magorrian 1999 for how generalizing to a more realistic stellar mass function can increase tidal disruption rates by a factor @xmath73 ) .      like many of the stationary smbh tidal disruption rate papers ( ulmer & syer 1998 , tremaine & magorrian 1999 , wang & merritt 2003 ) we consider the nuker surface brightness parametrization ( lauer et al . 1995 ) @xmath74 which was originally developed to model the surface brightnesses of nearby ellipticals and bulges resolved at the parsec level with the hubble space telescope . in equation ( [ nuker ] )",
    ", @xmath75 is the break radius at which the shallow inner power law of @xmath76 becomes the outer power law , @xmath77 .",
    "the strength of the break is determined by the dimensionless coefficient @xmath78 , and @xmath79 is the surface brightness at the break radius .",
    "the profile can be abel inverted to yield a volume density profile with power law exponents of @xmath80 and @xmath81 when @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "the nuker parametrization has many well - known surface brightness models as special cases ( byun et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the nuker galaxies are roughly divided into two categories based on the steepness of the surface brightness profile in the centermost regions : core galaxies and cusp galaxies .",
    "it has been suggested ( merritt & milosavljevic 2005 ) that core galaxies are formed when the inspiral and merger of two smbhs ejects stars from the host galaxy s center via 3-body interactions , scouring a core from the stellar profile - though subsequent star formation can rebuild the central parsecs into a cusp in the case of gas - rich ( so - called wet ) mergers ( kormendy et al .",
    "2009 , blecha et al .",
    "for this reason , we will take core galaxies as those which best represent the immediate post - recoil state of the stellar profile in gas - poor ( so - called dry ) mergers .",
    "we will consider cusp galaxies also , as they are likely to be relevant in wet merger scenarios .",
    "most core galaxies in the nuker sample tend to possess large central black hole masses @xmath31 ( @xmath84 , as determined by the @xmath85 relation ) . to examine a wider range of galaxy masses ,",
    "we do not directly use observed samples of galaxies but rather create a simple mock catalog of galaxies in which we simulate the black hole trajectories .",
    "important scaling relations which we require for all galaxies in our mock catalog are the @xmath86 relation ( tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) , @xmath87 and the bulge - black hole mass relation ( marconi & hunt 2003 ) @xmath88 with @xmath89 being total stellar mass and @xmath90 the bulge velocity dispersion .",
    "we also fit our galaxies to empirically determined calibrations of smbh influence radii ( merritt et al . 2009 ) : @xmath91 @xmath92 the first of these relations holds for core galaxies and the second for cusp galaxies . here the influence radius , @xmath93 is the radius within which there is a mass in stars equal to @xmath94 .",
    "the most relevant aspect of the nuker parametrization for our purposes is the broken power - law in the stellar density profile ; as we shall see , the trajectories of kicked black holes are strongly affected by central density gradients .",
    "while the most self - consistent way to proceed would be to numerically deproject scaled brightness profiles @xmath95 into luminosity density profiles @xmath96 , we suspect this would fail to capture an important part of the physics of black hole recoil . initially radial orbits in spherically symmetric potentials make multiple passes through galactic center , whereas initially radial orbits in nonspherical potentials will generally receive torques that increase their pericenter distance .",
    "this is of importance to this paper because orbital energy loss for recoiling black holes in dry mergers is dominated by stellar dynamical friction during passes through the densest central regions ( gualandris & merritt 2008 ) .",
    "using a spherical potential would produce purely radial orbits , artificially shortening the wandering life time of the black hole , and decreasing the number of offset tdes it can produce . to avoid this problem , we use an ad hoc density - potential pair that is designed to approximate the most important dynamics of a nuker profile but which is also easily generalizable to nonspherical geometries .",
    "specifically , we create a set of spheroidal isodensity surfaces    @xmath97    using the axisymmetric pseudoradius @xmath98 in these equations @xmath99 and @xmath100 are standard cylindrical coordinates , and the isodensity spheroids have dimensionless axis ratios @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "the so far free parameters @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 are calibrated using the corresponding values in the spherical spatial deprojections of the most recent nuker sample ( lauer et al . 2005 ) .",
    "none of those three parameters vary strongly with @xmath89 once the core / cusp dichotomy is accounted for , so we treat them as having gaussian distributions about their measured means , with variance also calibrated off the lauer et al .",
    "2005 sample . @xmath107 and @xmath108 are chosen so that the density profile is continuous at the break pseudoradius , @xmath106 , and @xmath109 is selected in combination with @xmath110 to both normalize the total stellar mass , @xmath89 , and to reproduce the correct value of @xmath111 .",
    "the final free parameter of our mock galaxy catalog is ellipticity @xmath112 .",
    "fortunately for our purposes , lauer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) measured isophote ellipticities for the galaxies in their sample , which we use to sample ellipticity parameter space ( again , due to its lack of variation with @xmath89 , we treat ellipticity as gaussian - distributed ) .",
    "the distinction between cores and cusps deserves more consideration , however . because smbhs above @xmath113 consume stars whole rather than tidally disrupting them , the majority of galaxies of interest to us fall into the mass range represented primarily by cusps . although scaling relations for core galaxy parameters exist ( faber et al .",
    "1997 ) , it is not clear how reliably they can be extrapolated an order of magnitude below the smallest core galaxies in the samples which they are based on . for our mock catalog ,",
    "we consider the mergers of initially cuspy galaxies , but treat separately two different limiting scenarios :    * in the first , the tendency of a binary smbh inspiral to scour a core is outmatched by star formation , and a nuclear cusp is preserved . in this pure cusp scenario , all",
    "free parameters \\{@xmath114 } are calibrated off the sample of cusp galaxies .",
    "we assume in this case that a fraction @xmath115 of the baryonic mass of the bulge mass is in the form of a gas disk , which we describe in more detail in  2.4 . * in the second , we consider a smbh binary which is successful at scouring a core , either because its progenitor merger was dry or because free gas was consumed or expelled prior to the late phase of the hard binary s evolution .",
    "for this case we calibrate the constant value of @xmath105 and the initial values @xmath116 off the cusp sample , but calibrate @xmath117 and final @xmath118 off the core sample , and manually  excavate \" a mass deficit @xmath119 to determine the final break radius @xmath120 .",
    "the final value for the new , cored break radius is @xmath121 in practice , this tends to increase the break radius by a factor of a few .",
    "here we have used the ellipsoidal eccentricity @xmath122 . in this second scenario",
    ", we set the remnant gas fraction @xmath123 .",
    "with our galaxy models fully determined , we can then integrate our density profiles numerically to calculate other relevant quantities such as the stellar potential and forces .",
    "here we use the standard method of homoeoids ( binney & tremaine 2008 , section 2.5 ) . due to the difficulty involved in even numerical calculation of a two - integral distribution function ( hunter & qian 1993 ) , particularly when an analytical , closed - form potential is lacking ( as is the case here ) we are forced to compute the velocity dispersion in the spherical limit and generalize by substituting @xmath124 for @xmath99 ; this introduces modest inaccuracy into the dynamical friction and gravitational focusing formulae used in  2.4 .",
    "the spherical limit of this broken power - law profile has a velocity dispersion @xmath125 for @xmath126 , and @xmath127 for @xmath128 .",
    "the stellar bulge population dominates gravitational effects for low velocity kicks , but higher velocity kicks carry smbhs into regions where the dark matter halo potential becomes important .",

    "1997 ) , given by @xmath129 here the scale distance @xmath130 and density factor @xmath131 are determined by assuming a concentration of 10 and truncating the nfw profile at @xmath132 , the virial radius at which @xmath133 , with @xmath134 the cosmological critical density .",
    "we also normalize the total dark matter mass @xmath135 using the latest calibration of the @xmath31-@xmath135 relation ( bandara et al .",
    "2009 ) , @xmath136 our assumption of spherical symmetry for the dark matter halo should be considered conservative , since nonspherical potentials extend the wandering time of the smbh .",
    "our general strategy for galaxy modeling is to select a fiducial value of smbh mass , a parameter set \\{@xmath114 } informed by the lauer et al .",

    "dynamical friction is the force which ultimately causes the kicked black hole to settle back into a near - stationary position in the center of its host galaxy , on timescales ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath154 years ( madau & quataert 2004 , blecha & loeb 2008 ) .",
    "the chandrasekhar formula is derived assuming a uniform and infinite background of stars , and it is not immediately clear how appropriate that is for a steep density profile in galactic nuclei , or for a black hole massive enough to excite a response in the stellar population .",
    "the applicability of the chandrasekhar formula to bound , recoiling black holes has been considered before ( gualandris & merritt , 2008 ) , and for appropriately chosen @xmath155 it was found to be fairly accurate until the point when the mass interior to the black hole s apogalacticon is of order @xmath31 . after this , coherent oscillations develop in the stars interior to the black hole s trajectory , and dynamical friction is found to become dramatically less effective at removing the black hole s orbital energy .",
    "we terminate our calculations at the onset of this orbital phase , both because our trajectory approximation would become quite inaccurate and also because tdes caused by a slow - moving smbh near the center of a galaxy would not be distinguishable from those caused by a stationary black hole . during these calculations , we neglect the extra `` core scouring '' caused by black hole recoil ( gualandris & merritt 2008 ) . the stellar population in the galactic center responds to a moving smbh by expanding , with a mass of stars equal to a few @xmath31 being displaced from the galactic center for kicks close to escape velocity ( and the effect is reduced for slower ones ) .",
    "neglect of this effect likely reduces the smbh wandering time and causes us to underestimate the total number of tdes per galaxy merger , but probably not by much , as axisymmetry of the stellar potentials prevents the smbhs from returning exactly to the center of their host galaxies where core scouring is most relevant .",
    "we highlight that dynamical friction removes the most orbital energy during passages through the densest regions of the smbh s trajectory .",
    "therefore trajectories with nonzero angular momentum ( due to an axisymmetric potential ) last longer before settling back into the galactic center than would center - crossing ones in spherical geometries .    in a dry merger",
    "it is sufficient to consider dynamical friction off stars and not gas .",
    "this regime could also apply to wet mergers where the gas is used up in star formation ( while the smbh binary is stalled ) or dispersed in binary quasar feedback .",
    "we identify both of these scenarios with our `` excavated core '' galaxies . if significant quantities of gas survive until the recoil phase of the merger , however , it is necessary to consider the effects of gas dynamical friction , which would apply more to our `` pure cusps . ''",

    "as mentioned before , it is not clear that the super - eddington phase of accretion will produce winds in which a @xmath231 offset is detectable , so predictions of kinematic offsets should be regarded as somewhat hypothetical . because spatial and kinematic offsets are angle - dependent , we average the observable quantities over all inclination angles for the host galaxy .",

    "consequently , our results show a much less pronounced difference in the observable tde rate between the disk emission and super - eddington outflows cases .    we then interpolate the results of these trajectory calculations over three different black hole physics scenarios , as discussed in  2.1 . in the first scenario ,",
    "a lack of free gas during the smbh inspiral leaves the spin vectors of the smbh binary randomly aligned with each other , producing a top - heavy kick distribution and a high average value of dimensionless spin ( @xmath242 ) .",

    "in this paper , we have demonstrated that super - eddington flares from recoiling black holes , if they exist along the lines envisioned in sq09 , will be observably offset to lsst in numbers ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath1 tdes per year .",
    "this is true for a broad range of assumptions about kick velocity distributions and galactic structure .",
    "this subset of transients would contain important scientific value as evidence of black hole recoil , and could potentially constrain the @xmath14 distribution . if super - eddington flares do not exist or if they differ significantly from the sq09 picture ( for example , if @xmath281 ) , optical emission from the accretion disks of tdes around recoiling black holes will still be accessible to lsst , although here the case is more marginal . if a large fraction of local universe smbh mergers proceed without significant spin alignment , the prospects for optical detection of disk emission from recoiling tdes are relatively good , but moderate amounts of alignment would likely suppress this .",
    "importantly , the majority of recoiled smbhs will remain bound to their host galaxies , making photometric subtraction critical for identification of recoil - associated disruption flares .",
    "depending on the nature of the super - eddington phase of accretion , a comparably large population of kinematically offset flares is potentially detectable , but would require spectroscopic followup to be realized .",
    "we have also shown that confusion with tdes from stationary smbhs will not be a major challenge in the detection of off - nuclear tdes , leaving supernova contamination as the main concern .",
    "if the scientific potential of spatially offset tdes is to be utilized , it will be necessary to construct transient survey pipelines which do not employ the typical `` galactic center '' cut when searching for tdes .",
    "although the challenges inherent to tde identification have been discussed elsewhere ( van velzen et al 2010 ) , the distinctive lightcurve and color evolution of tidal disruption flares are helpful in separating them .",
    "the large number of tdes expected to be observed by time domain surveys in the coming decade will calibrate our understanding of these events , so that once lsst is online , it may be able to confirm the smbh recoil predictions of numerical relativity .",
