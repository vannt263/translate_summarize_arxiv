    "young stars within 100 pc of earth are excellent laboratories for the study of stellar and planetary system evolution during ages from about ten to hundreds of millions of years . excepting the sun , it is difficult to deduce even a moderately accurate age of an individual star .",
    "astronomers have circumvented this problem by studying stars in rich open and globular clusters . excepting the hyades , no such clusters exist within 100 pc of earth .",
    "fortunately , beginning in the late 1990s , the existence of various substantial co - moving , coeval , associations of young nearby stars has become evident ( see reviews by zuckerman & song 2004 and torres et al 2008 ) .",
    "investigation of such stars will enhance knowledge of early stellar evolution .",
    "however , as a consequence of their proximity to earth , in the long term the most valuable contribution to astronomy of these youthful stars will likely lie in the realm of the origin and early evolution of planetary systems",
    " proximity buys one enhanced brightness and , for a given linear scale , an enhanced angular scale .",
    "table 1 lists papers in which new members of the four nearest co - moving groups of young stars have been proposed previously ; according to torres et al .",
    "( 2008 ) the mean distance from earth is less than 50 pc for the most secure members of each of these four groups . as new telescopes and cameras",
    "are being developed for imaging of young planets and the dusty disks out of which they form , it is important to complete the inventory of young stars near earth .",
    "a principal motivation of the present paper is identification of new members of the ab doradus and tucana / horologium associations . while considering the latter association we recognized new members of the columba association ( torres et al .",
    "2008 ) including the now famous hr 8799 (= hip 114189 ) that is orbited by at least four giant planets ( marois et al .",
    "2010 ) . the age and some other properties of hr 8799",
    "are considered in section 5.3 .",
    "while considering the ab dor association we have identified its first known a- and late - b type members . in addition , we have identified field members of the argus association that are of earlier spectral type and generally nearer to earth than members proposed previously by torres et al ( 2008 ) .    the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) discovered the phenomenon of dusty debris disks in orbit around main sequence stars ( aumann et al 1984 ) . by now",
    "@xmath0150 main sequence stars within 120 pc of earth appear to have excess infrared emission detectable with iras .",
    "almost all of these excesses are measured most convincingly at 60 microns wavelength ( moor et al 2006 , rhee et al 2007a and references therein ) , although occasionally instead at 25 microns ( rhee et al 2007b and melis et al 2010 and references therein ) . while the infrared space observatory ( iso ) added a few new debris disk stars ( e.g. , habing et al .",
    "2001 , silverstone 2000 ) , spitzer space telescope surveys provided the next major advance ; open clusters , nearby stellar associations , and nearby field stars have all been studied .",
    "spitzer surveys included a variety of goals , for example an understanding of the evolution of the quantity and temperature of the dusty debris with time , the association of debris disks with stars of different spectral classes , and association or lack thereof of debris with known planetary and stellar secondaries .",
    "iras was an all - sky survey whereas iso and spitzer pointed at only a small fraction of the sky .",
    "they were followed by the akari all - sky survey that , typically , was no more sensitive than iras .",
    "most recently , the wide field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) has performed a mid - infrared all - sky survey far more sensitive than those of iras or akari .",
    "a focus of the present paper is the evolution of debris disks as a function of their age .",
    "we present published and unpublished spitzer data for tucana / horologium , columba , ab doradus , and argus association members , identifying some previously unrecognized dusty systems .",
    "then we compare the overall debris disk status for these associations with previously published spitzer results for other stellar associations near earth .",
    "memberships of the four most prominent young stellar associations closest to earth ",
    "@xmath3 pic , tw hya , ab dor and tuc / hor  are considered in papers listed in table 1 . in the present paper",
    "we address the latter two , specifically we search for new members and for dusty debris disks . although stars of the columba association are generally more distant from earth than those of the four table 1 associations ( torres et al 2008 ) , because of various similarities between tuc / hor and columba stars we searched for columba stars within 65 pc of earth .",
    "the argus association , especially ic 2391 , as proposed by torres et al ( 2008 ; their tables 11 & 12 ) is on average much more distant from earth than are the four table 1 associations , but a few of their proposed argus field members are within 70 pc of earth .",
    "this inspired us to search for additional nearby argus field stars .",
    "proposed new members of ab dor , tuc / hor & columba , and argus , all within @xmath070 pc of earth , may be found in tables 2 - 4 .",
    "potential new members of these associations are identified by a match of ages and galactic space motions uvw .",
    "these characteristics can be measured or estimated via optical spectroscopy and astrometry and , also , optical and x - ray photometry .",
    "optical data for late - f through early - m type stars come principally from our spectroscopic survey described in section 3 . for these spectral types we generally observed only stars that appear in the rosat all sky survey ( rass ; voges et al 1999 , 2000 ) . for earlier spectral types",
    "an important source of data is the catalog of gontcharov ( 2006 ) which includes accurate radial velocities for stars from late - b through early - f type .    for dusty debris disk studies with the spitzer space telescope ,",
    "mips photometry was obtained via our go program @xmath43600 `` disk census of nearby stellar groups '' , but also via the spitzer archives . when poring through the spitzer literature we noticed that refereed papers had been devoted to most young and/or nearby stellar clusters and associations except that ab dor and tuc /",
    "hor were conspicuous by their absence ; we are now filling this void . because some likely members of ab dor and tuc / hor are identified in papers that post - date the cold spitzer mission ( including some papers listed in table 1 and also the present paper ) infrared photometry for these two stellar associations is incomplete .",
    "similar remarks pertain to columba and argus association members .",
    "perhaps wise , herschel , and the stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia ) will help to complete the disk census for stars in young , nearby associations .",
    "for southern hemisphere stars spectra were obtained with the 2.3 m telescope at the siding spring observatory ( sso ) of the australian national university .",
    "double - beam grating ( dbs ) and echelle spectrographs were employed at the two nasmyth foci .",
    "the red channel of the dbs covers the spectral range 6500 - 7450   at a measured resolution of 1.16   ( 0.55   pixel@xmath5 ) .",
    "eight orders of the echelle spectra cover portions of the wavelength range from 5800 to 7230  .",
    "we focus on orders that contain the h@xmath6 and li @xmath16708 lines . in these orders",
    "the measured resolution was 0.45   ( 0.17   pixel@xmath5 ) .",
    "radial velocities were determined by cross - correlating target and radial velocity standard spectra over 5 or 6 orders of the echelle that were chosen to produce strong correlations and have few atmospheric features .",
    "all spectra were reduced following a standard procedure ( bad pixel and cosmic ray removal , flat fielding , source extraction , telluric correction , etc . ) using iraf .",
    "equivalent widths of h@xmath6 and li @xmath16708 were measured with the iraf task splot .    for northern hemisphere stars we used the hamilton echelle spectrograph at the coude focus of the 3 m telescope at lick observatory .",
    "data reduction procedures were similar to those employed at siding spring .",
    "as noted in section 2 , mips photometry was obtained via go program @xmath43600 and also via the spitzer archives .",
    "for the mips 24 @xmath2 m band , we performed aperture photometry on post - bcd images provided by the spitzer archive using an aperture radius of 13 `` and sky annuli of 20 '' and 32 \" .",
    "an aperture correction of 1.17 was applied based on table 4.13 of the mips instrument handbook version 2.0 . in cases where the target is a binary object ( e.g. , hip 116748 )",
    ", we used a larger aperture size to collect the combined spitzer flux densities and compared them with combined optical and near - ir flux densities . for the mips 70 @xmath2 m band , we first created a mosaic image by combining bcd images with the spitzer mosaicker and point source extractor ( mopex ) tool and performed aperture photometry on the mosaic image .",
    "for a few stars spitzer irs data exist and we used these where appropriate to confirm or deny the existence of excess ir emission .",
    "spitzer results are summarized in tables 5 - 11 .",
    "figures 1 - 7 display the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of all ab dor , tuc / hor , nearby columba , and nearby argus field stars that we deem to definitely or probably have excess infrared emission .",
    "a fully automated sed fitting technique employing a theoretical atmospheric model ( hauschildt et al .",
    "1999 ) was used to predict stellar photospheric fluxes .",
    "a detailed description of our photospheric fitting procedure is given in section 2 of rhee et al .",
    "( 2007a ) , so we do not repeat it here . to check whether our atmospheric model well reproduces actual stellar photospheres , in figure 8",
    "we compare the model predictions with mips measurements at 24 @xmath2 m of a sample of nearby f , g , and k - type stars from a paper by trilling et al .",
    "stars plotted in figure 8 do not include any stars deemed by trilling et al to have either 24 or 70 @xmath2 m excess emission ( their tables 5 and 6 ) .",
    "the plotted stars are all 5th magnitude or fainter at k - band as measured in the 2mass survey .",
    "we avoid brighter stars that may be too bright to be measured accurately by 2mass in j - band . as may be seen in figure 8 , for k , g , and f - type stars the mips measured 24 @xmath2 m fluxes are on average about 3@xmath7 larger than the model predicted fluxes .",
    "while some of this offset may be due to small and previously unrecognized excess ir emission from some stars in the trilling et al sample , conservatively , we ignore this possibility and treat the 3@xmath7 as an effective error in the photospheric model predictions .",
    "therefore , in tables 8 - 10 the listed 24 and 70 @xmath2 m photospheric fluxes are those predicted from the theoretical atmospheric model but multiplied by a factor of 1.03 .",
    "in addition to this small mean offset , the figure 8 histogram indicates a @xmath87% uncertainty in the individual 24 @xmath2 m flux densities due to some combination of model uncertainties , measurement error , and perhaps other factors .    the mips handbook lists 4@xmath7 as the systematic 24 @xmath2 m absolute flux calibration uncertainty ( see also engelbracht et al .",
    "this 4@xmath7 is negligible when added in quadrature with the measurement uncertainty estimated just below .",
    "we checked the 7@xmath7 flux density uncertainty deduced from figure 8 in the following fashion . for stars in tables 8 - 10 with",
    "measured 24 @xmath2 m flux density less than the model photosphere ( corrected upward by the factor of 1.03 mentioned just above ) we calculate a percentage deficit given by the ratio of photosphere to measured 24 @xmath2 m flux density and then minus unity . for k8 to m3 stars in the ab dor group ( tables 5 and 8)",
    "this flux deficit often falls between 14 and 33@xmath7 .",
    "but for earlier - type ab dor stars the largest flux deficits are more modest ; only hip 19183 ( 14% ) and hd 317617 ( 15.5@xmath7 ) have flux deficits @xmath911@xmath7 . ( hd 317617 is the faintest 24 @xmath2",
    "m star in table 8 . ) in table 9 ( tuc / hor and columba stars ) the only non - m - type stars with flux deficits @xmath911@xmath7 are hip 2484 ( 14@xmath7 ) , hip 2487 ( 15.5@xmath7 ) , and cd-34 2406 ( 23% ) .",
    "( the latter star is by far the faintest 24 @xmath2 m star listed in table 9 . )",
    "the preceding paragraph indicates that while @xmath811% appears to be an appropriate 24 @xmath2 m flux density uncertainty for most non - m - type stars in tables 8 - 10 , adaptation of 16% for this uncertainty should encompass just about all such stars .",
    "this choice also encompasses the 7@xmath7 flux uncertainty at 24 @xmath2 m for stars in fig .",
    "8 , as mentioned above .",
    "thus , when a mips measured 24 @xmath2 m flux is a factor 1.16 larger than a photospheric flux listed in tables 8 - 10 , we deem a non - m - type star to have excess flux at 24 @xmath2 m .",
    "if the apparent 24 @xmath2 m mips excess lies between 12 and 16% , then in the fourth column of tables 8 - 10 we enter y ? indicating possible excess emission .",
    "in fact , only 3 stars in table 9 have entries of y ?",
    ", and only the binary star hip 16563 ( considered in section 5.5.1 ) has a y ?",
    "entry in table 8 .    at 70@xmath2 m ,",
    "the procedure is similar , except that we use 7@xmath7 as the calibration uncertainty as recommended in the mips handbook . 0.1 in",
    "tables 2 - 4 present stars we propose as new members of the ab doradus , tucana / horologium , columba , and field argus associations within @xmath070 pc of earth . based on their survey of southern hemisphere stars , torres et al ( 2008 ) introduced the columba and argus associations .",

    ", the u and w components of columba s space motions are more negative than those of tuc / hor ( see section 5.2 and the notes to table 3 ) .",
    "also , according to table 2 of torres et al , columba stars are more distant , on average , than stars in tuc / hor .",
    "the listed uvw of a few stars in our table 3 make it difficult to place them cleanly into either tuc / hor or columba . only a few columba stars in table 5 of torres",

    "nine stars in our table 3 lie in the northern hemisphere , whereas all but one of the tuc / hor and columba stars in zuckerman & song ( 2004 ) and torres et al ( 2008 ) lie in the southern hemisphere .",
    "since tuc / hor and columba have similar ages ( 30 myr , torres et al 2008 ) , for the purposes of understanding the evolution of dusty debris disks as a function of time , in table 11 and section 5.5.2 we consider members of these two associations together .",
    "as in our previous papers on these and other young , nearby , moving groups ( e.g. , song et al 2003 , zuckerman et al 2004 , zuckerman et al 2001a and 2001b ) , we rely on a combination of techniques  including galactic space motions uvw , location on color - magnitude diagrams , lithium abundance , and x - ray luminosity  to establish age and membership .",
    "tables 5 and 6 list tuc / hor and ab dor stars observed by spitzer as part of our go program @xmath43600 or as part of spitzer programs by other groups ; table 7 lists these various programs for the proposed argus association members within 70 pc of earth .",

    "stars proposed in table 2 as ab dor members are either of a- or late b - type . given that ab dor stars appear to be about as numerous as tucana and @xmath3 pictoris stars , identification of these early - type ab dor members while belated , is not unexpected .",

    "we regard hip 93580 ( table 2 ) as only a possible member of the ab dor group because the stellar uvw is somewhat discordant with that of the mean uvw for the group ( as may be seen from the entry in table 2 and the note to the table ) .",
    "in addition to the proposed table 2 early - type additions to the ab dor group , our spectroscopic studies at sso indicate that solar - type stars hd 293857 , ux col , and hd 178085 are also members ( as noted independently by torres et al 2008 and da silva et al 2009 ) .",

    "if , as we suggest in section 5.2 , the nucleus of the columba association lies near 5h30 m r. a. and is @xmath050 pc from earth , then currently hr 8799 is @xmath070 pc from the nucleus .",
    "a peculiar velocity of 2 km@xmath5 over a period of 30 myr would produce this separation .",
    "based on their bayesian statistical analysis , doyon et al ( 2010 ) independently deduce that hr 8799 is a member of the columba association .",
    "recently , currie et al ( 2011 ) also deduce a young age for hr 8799 ; models of dynamical stability and planet evolution ( cooling ) lead them a preferred age near 30 myr .",
    "the near - ir colors of the planets of hr 8799 differ from those of conventional ( old ) l- and t - type substellar objects , but are similar to that of the @xmath06 jupiter mass 2m1207b ( marois et al 2008 ; patience et al .",
    "2010 ; currie et al 2011 ) .",
    "as noted by marois et al ( 2010 ) , evolutionary models for cooling 30 myr old planets suggest masses about 6 times that of jupiter for the four known planets of hr 8799 .",
    "given the well - established age of 2m1207b ( @xmath010 myr ) , its unusual near - ir spectrum can most readily be attributed to atmospheric properties engendered by its low mass .",
    "hr 8799 lies below the position of a typical pleiades star on an a - star color - mag diagram ; see hr 8799 plotted on fig . 5 of zuckerman ( 2001 ) . because hr 8799 is a @xmath1 boo type star with a peculiar surface composition",

    "again this is consistent with a young age .",
    "hr 8799 has one of the most massive dusty debris disks known for any main sequence star ( rhee et al .",
    "the range of dust temperatures is extensive ( su et al 2009 ) ; in their preferred model an inner warm dust belt with temperature @xmath0150 k extends between 6 and 15 au from the star .",
    "marois et al ( 2010 ) note that the inner edge of such a dust belt could be in a 4:1 mean motion resonance with planet hr 8799e while the outer edge must be closer to the star than 15 au to avoid planet e s chaotic region .",
    "the location of the inner edge is determined only by a fit to the shorter wavelength portion of the spitzer irs spectrum combined with the assumption that the grains radiate like blackbodies at the relevant wavelengths ( see figures 3 and 4 in su et al 2009 ) . because the radius of a typical grain must be at least a few microns to avoid radiative blowout",
    ", this assumption is valid .",
    "since the longer wavelength irs emission is due to a blend of emission from the warm dust belt and cooler dust in an outer belt , the outer radius of the inner belt is not so well determined .",

    "<S> we consider spitzer space telescope mips photometry of stars in the @xmath030 myr old tucana / horologium and columba associations , the @xmath040 myr old field argus association , and the @xmath070 myr old ab doradus moving group . the percentage of stars in these young stellar groups that display excess emission above the stellar photosphere at 24 and 70 @xmath2 m wavelengths  indicative of the presence of a dusty debris disk  is compared with corresponding percentages for members of 11 open clusters and stellar associations with ages between 8 and 750 myr , thus elucidating the decay of debris disks with time . </S>"
