    "a062000 is the prototype soft x - ray transient ( sxt ) , which is an eruptive type of x - ray binary . for several days in 1975 the flux at earth from this source was greater than the combined total flux of all the other galactic x - ray binaries , including sco x-1 .",
    "a decade later , a dynamical study of its quiescent optical counterpart ( v616 mon ) led to the discovery of the first black hole ( bh ) primary in an sxt @xcite .",
    "a062000 is one of eight , similar short - period bh sxts ( @xmath5  hr ; @xcite",
    "@xcite ) . in the optical band , it is the best - studied of these systems because its counterpart is bright ( @xmath6 ) and close : @xmath7 kpc ( @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "the radial velocity amplitude of the secondary star is firmly established and has now been determined to the remarkable precision of 0.1% @xcite . however , a reliable estimate of the bh mass @xmath8 , which depends on a robust determination of the orbital inclination angle @xmath9 , has remained elusive .",
    "several measurements of @xmath9 have been made by modeling the ellipsoidal variability of the secondary , but they have been inconsistent @xcite .",
    "the determination of @xmath9 is complicated by a variable and phase - dependent component of light from the accretion disk .",
    "recently , however , a comprehensive analysis of all of the available light curve data ( 32 data sets spanning 30 years ) points to consistent values of inclination and bh mass : @xmath10  and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "our group has published spin estimates for five stellar - mass bhs @xcite . meanwhile , the spins of several stellar - mass bhs have also been obtained by modeling the profile of the fe k line ( see @xcite  @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the spins we find are all quite high , with values of the spin parameter @xmath4 in the range 0.7 to @xmath12 .",
    "the dimensionless quantity @xmath13 with @xmath14 , where @xmath8 and @xmath15 are respectively the bh mass and angular momentum @xcite .",
    "we use the x - ray continuum - fitting method , which was pioneered by @xcite .",
    "our spin estimates are based on our version of the novikov - thorne thin accretion disk model @xcite and an advanced treatment of spectral hardening @xcite .",
    "we only consider spectra that contain a dominant thermal component @xcite and for which the eddington - scaled bolometric disk luminosity is moderate , @xmath16 @xcite .    for the continuum - fitting method to succeed",
    "it is essential to have accurate values of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath17 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such as those reported above for a062000 .",
    "herein , we use these input data and the only suitable , extant x - ray spectrum of the source in order to estimate the spin of the bh primary . although our spin measurement is based on a single spectrum , we have considerable confidence in our result for the following two reasons : ( 1 ) in our earlier work , we have found that our measurements of spin , or equivalently the dimensionless radius of the innermost stable circular orbit @xmath18 ) , for a particular source are remarkably consistent over years or decades ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most compelling is our recent study of the persistent source lmc x-3 : hundreds of observations obtained over a span of 26 years by eight different missions give values of @xmath19 , and hence @xmath4 , that are consistent within a few percent ( steiner et al .",
    "2010 ) . one important conclusion from this study is that a single high quality spectrum is a good proxy for a large collection of spectra .",
    "( 2 ) the _ oso-8 _ spectrum in question is a very high quality spectrum for the determination of spin via the continuum - fitting method : it is a remarkably pure thermal spectrum that is almost completely free of the effects of comptonization ( section 3 ) , and it was obtained using a stable , advanced proportional - counter detector that was the forerunner of the _ rxte _ pca detectors .",
    "a062000 was observed using the goddard cosmic x - ray spectroscopy experiment ( gcxse ) aboard _ oso-8 _ @xcite .",
    "the detector employed , namely the c detector , is a sealed multiwire xenon - methane proportional counter with a net effective area of 237  @xmath20 , which is fitted with a 51 ( fwhm ) circular collimator .",
    "the observation commenced on 1975 september 29 at 11:58  ut and continued for 3.0 days during which the intensity of the source was @xmath21 crab @xcite .",
    "the average collimator - corrected raw count rate was @xmath22 counts  s@xmath23 and varied by @xmath24% over the course of the observations .",
    "the gain and detector resolution ( 18% at 6 kev ) were determined using an on - board @xmath25 source , and the energy calibration is good to a precision of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we first ran the ftool _ osofindfast _ to determine the `` good observing days '' and then downloaded the appropriate raw pha data .",
    "these data had already been filtered to eliminate times of high background during passage through the south atlantic anomaly and times of earth occultation . attending only to the data from detector c , we ran the tool _ osopha _ to extract the 63-channel spectrum ( spanning 260 kev ) , and we added a 2% systematic error to all the channels ; _ osopha _ automatically corrected the counting rates for dead time by the factor 0.704 .",
    "the effective source exposure time for the observation is 21.3 ks .",
    "we then used the tools _ osofindfast _ and _ osopha _ to extract and examine background spectra from several locations .",
    "our results are insensitive to the choice of the background region , and we finally settled on a region centered at @xmath27 and @xmath28 and an effective background observation time of 3.35 ks .",
    "we computed a correction to the response of the detector by comparing the power - law spectrum of @xcite , our standard reference spectrum @xcite , to the parameters derived by analyzing a spectrum of the crab that was obtained just 12 days prior to the observation of a062000 . following a new correction procedure @xcite",
    ", we computed a @xcite normalization coefficient @xmath29 and a slope difference @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the ratio of the observed normalization to that of @xcite , and @xmath32 is the difference between the observed value of the photon index and that of the reference spectrum .",
    "this correction is applied in all the analysis work below via a custom xspec multiplicative model .",
    "_ preliminary , nonrelativistic analysis : _ all of the data analysis and model fitting throughout this paper were performed using xspec version 12.6 @xcite . as in our earlier work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we first make an assessment of the data by analyzing it with the nonrelativistic disk model diskbb . for modeling the weak compton component of emission",
    "we use our convolution model simpl @xcite , which far outperforms the standard power - law model ( powerlaw ) with its troublesome divergence at low energies @xcite .",
    "the parameters of simpl and powerlaw are similar ; their principal parameter , the photon index @xmath33 is identical .",
    "however , the normalization parameter for simpl is the scattering fraction  the fraction @xmath34 of the seed photons that are scattered into the power - law tail  rather than the photon flux .",
    "thus , the model we first employ is tbabs(simpl@xmath35diskbb ) , where tbabs is a widely - used model of low - energy absorption @xcite .",
    "we fitted the data over the energy range 2.217 kev @xcite .",
    "because of the detector s limited low - energy response , we are unable to fit for the hydrogen column density @xmath36 , which we estimate from published values of the reddening . based on the five refereed papers known to us",
    ", we find @xmath37 with a most frequently - cited value of 0.35 @xcite .",
    "we adopt the value @xmath38 . assuming @xmath39 and @xmath40  @xmath41  @xmath42 @xcite",
    ", we obtain our estimate of the column density : @xmath43 .",
    "the fit to the pha spectrum is good ( @xmath44 ) , and the temperature is precisely determined : @xmath45  kev .",
    "moreover , the parameters of the comptonized emission are well determined : @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the best - fit value of the scattering fraction is low , 0.8% ( compare @xcite  @xcite and @xcite  @xcite ) , and it is even lower for the relativistic model ( 0.6% ; see below ) .",
    "thus , this spectrum is thermal dominant in the extreme @xcite . because the compton component is faint the fitted values of both @xmath48 and @xmath4 depend very weakly on how one models this nonthermal emission .",
    "we are fortunate that in porting the _",
    "oso-8 _ gcxse software / data to the heasarc that precisely the same spectrum of a062000 we consider was used to illustrate how one reduces and analyzes _ oso-8 _ data .",
    "the model employed in this example is phabs(diskbb+powerlaw ) , and the fixed column density is @xmath49% higher , @xmath50 . using this model , we obtain precisely the same temperature reported in the example , namely @xmath51  kev , which confirms the correctness of our reduction / analysis procedures .    _ relativistic analysis : _ we turn now to the analysis of the data using our fully relativistic accretion disk model kerrbb2 , which includes self - irradiation of the disk ( `` returning radiation '' ) and limb darkening @xcite .",
    "the effects of spectral hardening are incorporated into the basic model kerrbb via a pair of look - up tables for the hardening factor @xmath52 corresponding to two representative values of the viscosity parameter : @xmath53 and 0.1 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the entries in this table were computed using a second relativistic disk model bhspec @xcite .",
    "we refer to the model kerrbb plus this table / subroutine as kerrbb2 .",
    "the model kerrbb2 has just two fit parameters , namely the bh spin parameter @xmath4 and the mass accretion rate @xmath54 . for further details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we now analyze the data in exactly the same manner as before , except that we replace diskbb by kerrbb2 : tbabs(simpl@xmath35kerrbb2 ) .",
    "we fix the column density at @xmath55@xmath42 , and we have four free parameters : the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath4 , the mass accretion rate @xmath56 , the photon index of the high energy component @xmath33 , and the scattering fraction @xmath34 . we fitted the spectrum with the input parameters fixed at their baseline values ( see footnote to table  [ tablefirst ] ) .",
    "the normalization was fixed at unity ( as appropriate when @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath17 are held fixed ) .",
    "we included the effects of limb darkening ( lflag = 1 ) and returning radiation ( rflag = 1 ) , and we set the torque at the inner boundary of the disk to zero ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the fitted results are presented in the first row of table  [ tablefirst ] .",
    "compared to the nonrelativistic fit , the fit here is even better ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the luminosity is moderate ( @xmath59 ) and easily meets our selection criterion @xmath60 ( section  1 ) . of prime interest",
    ", we find a low and precise value of the spin parameter , @xmath61 .",
    "the unfolded photon spectrum and fit residuals are shown in figure  [ figurefirst ] .",
    "the best - fit value of the scattered fraction is very low , only 0.6% ( table  [ tablefirst ] ) . the second and third rows of table  [ tablefirst ] show that the uncertainty in @xmath62 has a quite modest effect on the value of the spin parameter , shifting the best - fit value of @xmath4 by @xmath63 .",
    "the last two rows of table  [ tablefirst ] further show that fixing the power - law index @xmath33 at @xmath64 from its best - fit value of 3.53 also has a modest effect on @xmath4 , shifting its best - fit value by at most @xmath65 .",
    "in fact , relative to the _ total _ uncertainty in @xmath4 these small shifts are over ten times smaller still , i.e. , @xmath66 , as we now show .",
    "_ comprehensive error analysis : _ the statistical uncertainty in @xmath4 is small , and other sources of error dominate . ignoring for now uncertainties in the theoretical model ( see section 4 ) , we consider the effects of uncertainties in ( 1 ) the input parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath17 , ( 2 ) the column density @xmath62 , ( 3 ) the viscosity parameter @xmath67 @xcite , and ( 4 ) the metallicity @xmath68 .",
    "we first note that , as in the case of lmc x-1 @xcite , the uncertainty in the metallicity of the disk gas is negligible compared to the statistical error : we find that @xmath4 changes by only @xmath69 when we vary the metallicity from our default value of @xmath70 ( solar ) to @xmath71 .    in order to determine the error in @xmath4",
    ", we performed an analysis that considers at once the above items ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , i.e. , the combined uncertainties in @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath17 and @xmath62 .",
    "we fix the viscosity parameter to its baseline value , @xmath53 . in order to determine the error in @xmath4",
    ", we performed monte carlo simulations assuming that the uncertainties in the four parameters are normally and independently distributed .",
    "specifically , we ( 1 ) generated 3000 parameter sets for @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath17 and @xmath62 ; ( 2 ) computed for each set the look - up table for the spectral hardening factor @xmath52 using the model bhspec ; and ( 3 ) using these @xmath52-tables , obtained @xmath4 by fitting our model to the spectrum .",
    "the results for the 3000 simulation runs are shown in figure  [ figuresecond ] .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath17 ( panel _ c _ ) dominates the error in @xmath4 , with the uncertainty in @xmath8 having less than half as much effect , while the uncertainties in @xmath9 and @xmath62 are smaller still .",
    "the corresponding histogram for the spin displacements in @xmath4 about the most probable value is shown in figure  [ figurethird ] by the light solid line .",
    "the analysis above is for our baseline value of @xmath53 .",
    "following precisely the same procedures , we also performed the monte carlo analysis for @xmath72 , and the result is the dashed - line histogram shown in figure  [ figurethird ] .",
    "the summation of these two histograms results in the large histogram ( heavy solid line ) .",
    "the combined distribution , which corresponds to a total of 6000 simulations , has a median spin value of 0.12 and implies a @xmath73 error of ( -0.19 , + 0.19 ) .",
    "_ thus , considering all significant observational and model - parameter uncertainties , we arrive at our final result for the spin of a062000 : @xmath74  ( @xmath75)_. the corresponding radius of the inner disk , which is uncertain by @xmath76% , is just 7% less than the schwarzschild value of @xmath77 .",
    "any measurement of bh spin is only as good as the theoretical model behind it .",
    "the continuum - fitting method assumes that the radial profile of the disk @xmath78 is given by the analytical form derived by ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  nt ) . because any serious error in the nt model ( e.g. , the assumption of vanishing torque at the isco ) will lead to large systematic errors in the derived bh spin values",
    ", we have mounted a major effort to scrutinize the nt model . in @xcite",
    ", we reported a 3d grmhd simulation of a thin disk ( @xmath79 ) around a nonspinning bh .",
    "we showed that the angular momentum profile matches the nt prediction to within @xmath80 , indicating that any magnetic coupling across the isco is weak , and we estimated that the additional disk luminosity due to this weak coupling is only @xmath81 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have carried out simulations of similarly thin disks , but they conclude that deviations from the nt model are much larger , with the specific angular momentum deviating by up to 15% . in a recent paper  @xcite ,",
    "we report simulations corresponding to a variety of disk thicknesses and bh spins . for thin disks with @xmath82",
    "we agree with shafee et al.s conclusion that the nt model provides an accurate description of both the angular momentum profile and the luminosity ( see figures 14 and 15 in penna et al . ) .",
    "we suggest that the contrary results obtained by noble et al .",
    "are because ( i ) they used for the initial magnetic field in their simulations a topology with long - range radial coherence , which we argue is inappropriate for a thin disk , and ( ii ) they included the contribution of the corona , even though the corona is generally believed not to participate in the optically thick thermal emission we model in the continuum - fitting method .",
    "the inner x - ray - emitting portion of a thin accretion disk is presumably aligned with the spin axis of the bh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in determining the spin of a062000 and most sources , we assume that the bh s spin is closely aligned with the orbit vector ; a misalignment of more than several degrees would significantly affect our results ( e.g. , see figure  [ figuresecond]@xmath83 ) .",
    "there is presently no good evidence for significant misalignments despite two often - cited cases ( see section 2.2 in * ? ? ?",
    "a recent population - synthesis simulation study indicates that the majority of bh binaries have relatively small misalignment angles ( @xmath84 ; @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "the approved nasa gems polarimetry mission , which is scheduled for a 2014 launch , is expected to soon provide the capability to determine directly the degree of alignment to an accuracy of a few degrees @xcite .",
    "based on modeling the 197576 x - ray and optical light curves , @xcite find a low and consistent value of spin , @xmath85 , for our mass of @xmath86  @xmath87 and for a fixed value of @xmath88 ( see their figure  7 ) .",
    "however , for this model their fitted value of the viscosity parameter , @xmath89 , is significantly higher than the higher fiducial value of @xmath72 that we have adopted ( section  3 ; see discussion in section 5.3 in gou et al .",
    "2009 ) or the values of @xmath90 based on the `` best observational evidence '' @xcite .",
    "we are unable to estimate @xmath4 for larger values of @xmath67 because the required bhspec table models ( section  3 ) do not exist .",
    "however , it is clear ( e.g. , figure  3 ) that larger values of @xmath67 will decrease our estimate of @xmath4 .",
    "recent grmhd simulations by @xcite show that luminous , geometrically - thick disks with @xmath91 ( corresponding to @xmath92 ; mcclintock et al .",
    "2006 ) can falsely appear to host bhs with low spins if the inner disk is significantly tilted with respect to the bh spin axis .",
    "it is highly unlikely that this effect can explain the low spin of a062000 because the observed disk luminosity is low , @xmath93 ( table  1 ) , and the disk is correspondingly thin @xmath94 . in this case , as fragile notes",
    ", one does not expect the inferred value of spin to be suppressed by the tilted - disk effect that he describes .    despite its faint corona and low spin ,",
    "a062000 was a bright transient radio source in outburst , decaying from @xmath95  mjy to @xmath96  mjy in the period from about 12 to 24 days following its discovery on 3 august 1975 .",
    "a reanalysis of these data by @xcite indicates multiple jet ejections of initially optically - thick components .",
    "the authors find that the source was extended on arcsec scales , and they infer a relativistic expansion velocity . even in quiescence ,",
    "the radio source was detected at a level of @xmath97 mjy , indicating the presence of a partially self - absorbed synchrotron jet @xcite .",
    "if jets are powered by bh spin , then jet power is likely to increase dramatically with increasing @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the expected dependence is so steep that , for @xmath98 , the jet receives more power from the accretion disk than from the bh @xcite .",
    "therefore , given the low spin of a062000 , it would appear that the jet inferred in this source was probably driven by the accretion disk , not the bh . in closing",
    ", we note that a statistical study by @xcite , although based on data of uneven quality , found no evidence that bh spin powers jets .",
