    "the recent experiment demonstrates the feasibility of coherent control of single - qubit gates by the short bursts of oscillating magnetic fields @xcite . in many spin - based quantum computation schemes ,",
    "isotropic heisenberg interactions are dominant since the symmetric hamiltonian conserves the total spin .",

    "the anisotropic interaction between electrons in conduction band is very typical in solids @xcite .",
    "this coupling can show the dresselhaus form for the bulk inversion asymmetry @xcite .",
    "the heterostructure asymmetry can also induce the rashba coupling @xcite .",
    "these two couplings can bring out the asymmetric anisotropic dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction @xcite .",
    "unlike the isotropic exchange , the asymmetric spin - orbit coupling can greatly reduce the gate fidelity which can not be neglected in quantum information processing @xcite . to eliminate the impacts of these asymmetric anisotropic couplings , some useful methods of universal quantum computation",
    "were used by means of encoding a logical qubit into more physical spins @xcite .",
    "these encoding schemes will unavoidably waste many resources of physical quantum spins .    in this paper ,",

    "a discussion concludes the paper .",
    "the recent work presented the microscopic description of the interaction between electron spins in two coupled semiconductor quantum dots @xcite .",
    "different from the exchange of electrons in conduction band , the asymmetric coupling arises from the coulomb interaction and from the conduction - valance band mixing . in the twisted spin representation @xcite , the hamiltonian of the two asymmetric coupled spins @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be expressed by @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 represents the symmetric isotropic heisenberg interaction .",
    "the term of @xmath4 denotes the symmetric anisotropic interaction .",
    "the last term @xmath5 is the main part of asymmetric anisotropic exchange in the dzyaloshinskii - moriya form of @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 is the isotropic heisenberg exchange constant , @xmath8 is the orientation of the asymmetric anisotropic exchange @xmath9 . the inherent parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the asymmetric anisotropic exchange @xmath9 depends on the separation distance and the orientation between two coupled quantum dots @xcite .",
    "it is found that the error of the gate from the asymmetric anisotropic exchange @xmath9 is far beyond the limit of fault tolerant quantum computation @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to investigate the method to eliminate the effects of the asymmetric exchange .    by diagonalization of the hamiltonian @xmath12 , the asymmetric form can be rotated into the isotropic one @xmath13 in the new spin hilbert space with @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the unitary rotation .",
    "the new spin space can be expanded by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the single - qubit basis of spin operator @xmath18 with the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath19 .",
    "the definite form of unitary rotation @xmath15 takes a key part in the following scheme of quantum computation . without losing the generality ,",
    "two typical kinds of asymmetric exchange orientations of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are considered .    in the case of @xmath22 ,",

    "by means of the representation transformation , the unitary rotation @xmath25 can be given in the space of @xmath26 with    @xmath27    similarly , the four eigenstates of the hamiltonian with the orientation @xmath28 can be expressed as @xmath29 the definite form of the unitary operation @xmath30 in the space of @xmath26 can also be obtained by the representation transformation @xmath31    it is clear that the unitary operations @xmath15 depend only on the orientation of asymmetric anisotropic exchange @xmath32 and the strength ratio of the asymmetric exchange to the isotropic constant @xmath33 .",
    "this means that one kind of inherent quantum - dots structures can determine the corresponding kind of unitary operation form @xmath15 . after the operation of @xmath15 ,",
    "the asymmetric anisotropic term will be eliminated in the hamiltonian . in the new spin space ,",
    "the new form of the hamiltonian takes on the isotropic heisenberg interaction of @xmath34 where the new spin operator can be expressed by @xmath35 . the method to apply",
    "the unitary operation is one essential aspect in the quantum - dots quantum computation .",
    "before further discussions , the major property of the unitary operation @xmath15 needs to be investigated .",
    "it is found that the entanglement of the thermal state @xmath36 keeps the same as that of @xmath37 . since the entanglement of the states",
    "can not be varied when the states are transformed by unitary local rotations , the two - qubit operation @xmath15 can be expressed by the direct product of two unitary local rotations @xmath38 .",
    "recent experiment implies that arbitrary single - qubit rotations can be implemented in quantum dots @xcite . after the operation of @xmath39 , the two - qubit evolution operator can be expressed by @xmath40 when",
    "the evolution operator @xmath41 is applied to the initial quantum state @xmath42 for a period of time @xmath43 , the intermediate state can be written by @xmath44 .",
    "if the unitary rotation @xmath15 is then employed , the whole quantum state can be obtained by @xmath45 meanwhile , eq .",
    "( 8) can also be expressed as @xmath46 .",
    "thus , when the evolution time satisfies @xmath47 @xmath48 , one can obtain the swap quantum gate @xmath49 which just exchanges the quantum states between two electron spins @xcite .",
    "moreover , with the help of single - qubit gate sequence , the controlled - not gate can be constructed by @xmath50 where the square - root of the swap gate @xmath51 corresponds to the half evolution time @xmath52 of the operator @xmath53 .",
    "it is important how to apply this unitary transformation @xmath15 .",
    "it is known that the operation @xmath15 can be decomposed by two local unitary rotations @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "arbitrary unitary operation at qubit @xmath56 can be written as @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the phase shift with respect to the angle @xmath59 , @xmath60 represents the rotation by the angle @xmath61 about the @xmath62-axis and @xmath63 is that by the angle @xmath64 about the @xmath65-axis .",
    "it is found that the unitary rotation @xmath15 can be given by single - qubit rotations as a function of the orientation and the relative strength of the asymmetric exchange .",
    "for the two cases of @xmath22 and @xmath66 , one has @xmath67 this equation demonstrates that the special unitary operation @xmath15 is accomplished by two local axis - symmetrical rotations . therefore ,",
    "if the unitary rotation @xmath15 is operated in the sequence of @xmath68 , the asymmetric anisotropic exchange can be rotated into the isotropic heisenberg model with the same coupling @xmath7 .    from eq .",
    "( 10 ) , it is clear that these local rotations depend critically on the values of the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the fidelity of one gate can be expressed by @xmath71/tr[u_{0}^{\\dag}u_{0}]\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the perfect operation without variations and @xmath73 is the one with small variations of @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the fidelity @xmath76 of swap gate @xmath49 and the gate errors @xmath77 are calculated and plotted in fig . 1 in dimensionless unit . the fidelity @xmath76 is plotted in fig .",
    "it is seen that the gate fidelity decreases when the variations @xmath78 and @xmath79 increase . the gate error @xmath80 is shown in fig .",
    "the order of the gate errors induced by the asymmetric anisotropic exchange is about @xmath81 which is much higher than the limit of fault tolerant quantum computation @xmath11 .",
    "even when @xmath79 is varied from @xmath82 to @xmath83 , the errors can not be reduced and the curves can not be distinguished . by means of local single - qubit operations",
    "@xmath84 given by eq .",
    "( 10 ) , the order of gate errors can be reduced to about @xmath85 which is much smaller than @xmath11 .",
    "the error is reduced from @xmath86 when @xmath79 is varied from @xmath82 to @xmath83 .",
    "this means that the method in this paper is feasible with the small variations of the asymmetric anisotropic exchanges .",
    "if there are external magnetic fields , the general hamiltonian in the inhomogeneous fields can be expressed as @xmath87 it is known that the isotropic heisenberg interaction in the uniform magnetic field can be regarded as one useful model for the universal quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( 12 ) can be rotated into the isotropic one by the operation of @xmath68 .",
    "the condition of what kind of the inhomogeneous fields can be transformed in the same sequence of @xmath88 needs to be investigated .",
    "it is demonstrated the axially symmetric magnetic fields with the same strength satisfy this condition .",
    "for the case of @xmath22 , the previous inhomogeneous fields on two qubits need to be applied in the form of @xmath89 similarly , when the orientation of the asymmetric exchange @xmath21 , the magnetic fields on two qubits satisfy @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , after the certain period of time @xmath52 , the phase - shifted swap action can be constructed @xmath91 the controlled - not gate can be realized by the phase - shifted swap gate and single - qubit rotations @xcite .",
    "it is found that the asymmetric interactions can be transformed into the isotropic heisenberg model after the operation of local symmetric rotations @xmath92 .",
    "the local operations on each qubit are determined by the orientation and the relative strength of asymmetric exchange to the isotropic constant .",
    "the gate fidelity is decreased when the small variations of the asymmetric anisotropy increase .",
    "when the asymmetric anisotropy is eliminated by the transformation , the order of gate errors is reduced to about @xmath93 which is much smaller than the limit of fault tolerant quantum computation .",
    "some special inhomogeneous magnetic fields can also contribute to the realization of quantum logic gates .",
