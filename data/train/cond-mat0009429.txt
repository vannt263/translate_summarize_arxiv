    "the influence of the granular structure on the electromagnetic superconducting properties has been consistently recognized @xcite , and simple formulas and models were used to account for the main features of the ac susceptibility @xmath1 as a function of temperature @xmath2 and magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "the critical state model@xcite , and its extended versions@xcite , have been useful in interpreting the observed values of the magnetic response of type - ii superconductors and the underlying interplay between pinning and creep forces on josephson vortices in the grain and intergrain regions , both in zero - field cooling and field cooling experiments @xcite .",
    "other effects , such as phase coherence and decoherence phenomena , peculiar to josephson junctions and the quantum interference effects in the loops , add extra complexity to the polycrystalline magnetic response .",
    "in general , these effects have been neglected or taken into account only partially ( or indirectly ) to describe the ac susceptibility in polycrystalline superconductors .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to consider them explicitly , to deduce a simple formula to describe the granular superconductors susceptibility in terms of the josephson junction and loop areas , the penetration depth , the decoherence decay length and a critical exponent , and to show the ability of the formula to account qualitatively and quantitatively the rather complex behavior of @xmath1 . to illustrate this , magnetic response data of quite different samples",
    "are considered and fitted with fairly good results .",
    "the understanding of the granular structure influence on the electromagnetic properties is not only of relevant interest but also of a challenging nature .",
    "many effects , related with the phase coherence and josephson vortices pinning and displacements , combine to give rise to fluorishly different experimental results .",
    "careful measurements reveal subtle and systematic quantum coherence phenomena that affect the order parameter of adjacent superconducting grains and produce well defined field- and sample - dependent oscillations , apparent in the critical transport and screening currents behavior@xcite .    in the last years we have been interested in high precision measurements of critical transport and screening currents as functions of the temperature , magnetic field and the granularity of the superconducting samples .",
    "the main idea in these experiments was to reduce the effects of macroscopic averaging @xcite .",
    "recently , a phenomenological theory of the josephson junction between two superconducting grains , taking into account the effects of coherence and decoherece decay lengths on the order parameter , has been suggested to describe the ambegaokar - baratoff to ginsburg - landau transition in the temperature behavior of the critical transport current @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we study the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath4 as a function of the temperature and the external magnetic field .",
    "the measurement of @xmath0 permits to study the tunneling phenomena far away from the critical points and limits the current paths to a few adjacent grains . for this report",
    "we consider two quite different samples : a  bad  and porous sample b , with irregular grains and low magnetic susceptibility , and a  good  sample g , with closely packed parallelepiped shaped grains and much higher value of @xmath0 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "sample susceptibility also presents oscillations and a pronounced decrease of @xmath5 with increasing magnetic field ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the contentsof this paper are as follows . in the second section we recast the clem s picture of the screening currents in granular systems .",
    "we then recall , in section iii , some basic and known expressions of the superconducting theory and ` put them together ' in a kind of phenomenological formula to describe the real part of the ac susceptibility . in section iv , this phenomenological theory is applied to rather different granular superconductors , and finally in section v we give a brief discussion .",
    "it is well known that the basic magnetic properties of ceramics are created by the currents circulating inside the grains , which tend to expel the external magnetic field from parts of the volume ( regions of the type i in figure 3 ) and thus lead to a diamagnetic behavior . following clem s picture of the granular behavior ,",
    "we distinguish three characteristic regions as shown in figure 3 . in this figure ,",
    "the screening current in regions ii , responsible for the basic diamagnetic properties of the material , is distributed as suggested in the lower part of the figure .",
    "the current density reaches its maximum ( critical value ) at the boundary of this region ii , and beyond this region s  surface ",
    ", i.e. in region iii , there is no screening current .",
    "josephson tunneling junctions are formed in regions iii and iv and the josephson tunneling process connects the ` surfaces ' of regions ii in adjacent grains , which are of course in a critical state .",
    "it is important to stress that , even if the applied magnetic field is weak , far away from its critical value ( from the macroscopic point of view ) , the screening currents and the local magnetic field on each grain determine a local criticality and the penetration length , the existence or non existence of screening currents and , consequently , the position of the surfaces limiting the regions ii , which ( from the microscopical point of view ) are in critical condition .",
    "the ceramic structure permits the flowing of circulating currents over clusters of grains .",
    "the represented cluster of three grains ( in figure 4 ) is only an example ; there is a possibility of current paths over a great amount of grains with josephson type junctions between each pair .",
    "the corresponding currents produce some additional magnetic effects and modify the magnitude of @xmath0 .",
    "these currents are , of course , regulated by the quantum interference phenomena and the josephson junctions .    in figure 4 ,",
    "the current 1 flowing over the external part of a cluster circulates in the same direction as the intragranular currents .",
    "this current has a diamagnetic character and raises the value of @xmath6 .",
    "however , it does not expel the external magnetic field completely from the junctions .",
    "the internal part of the circuit contains the current 2 , flowing in the opposite direction , though alongwith the currents inside the grains , it is of paramagnetic character@xcite , and permits the passage of some vortices of external magnetic field through the intergranular region v.",
    "as in the case of the critical transport current , the behavior of the magnetization current presents systematic sample - dependent oscillations . these oscillations in polycrystalline and highly random systems , with low density of irregular grains , can also be explained reasonably well in terms of the superposition of josephson junction and quantum - interfering intergrain currents .",
    "therefore , the total current contains the contributions of the josephson type currents @xmath7 and loop currents @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the lowest junction s critical current in the loop @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the magnetic flux through the junction s area given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 the magnetic flux through the loops s area taken as @xmath14 at this level we have the fundamental quantities in terms of the basic granular parameters : the distance between two adjacent grains @xmath15 , the junction size @xmath16 , the loop area @xmath17 and the magnetic penetration length @xmath18 whose temperature dependence is @xmath19 with @xmath20 the zero temperature penetration depth and @xmath21 a positive critical exponent ( in bcs theory @xmath22 ) .    in macroscopic samples , different areas of junctions and loops",
    "are possible .",
    "therefore , the total magnetization current @xmath23 can be thought of as the superposition of a collection of loop currents @xmath24 modulated by @xmath25 .",
    "thus , to describe the magnetization current we shall consider the expression @xmath26 where @xmath27    \\label{suscepy}\\ ] ] and @xmath28 is the zero temperature decoherence length defined as in reference @xcite . in polycrystalline samples many of these parameters vary randomly . notice that the temperature dependence is not completely factorized because both @xmath29 and @xmath13 depend also on the temperature , and @xmath30 and @xmath28 depend on the magnetic field .    on the other hand , taking into account that the magnetization current and the susceptibility are quantities proportional to each other , it is possible to conclude that the real part of the susceptibility @xmath0 is described by a similar function @xcite , i.e. @xmath31\\ ] ] the magnetic field dependence is like that in equation ( [ suscepy ] ) . for small values of @xmath32 , applied in the experimental measurements discussed below , we can safely assume that the sum upon the junction and loop indices can be substituted by a contribution of a junction and a loop with  effective  areas @xmath33 and @xmath34 , such that @xmath35 these equations will be used , in the next section , to adjust the experimental points choosing different values for the parameters @xmath30 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "taking @xmath38 , and the  average  value of @xmath20 ( @xmath39)@xcite , it is also possible to estimate the  effective  values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "as mentioned above , a more flexible but rigorous application of the definition of the critical parameter lead us , as in previous works , to determine reliable and precise measurements of critical transport currents as functions of the magnetic field , based on direct transport critical currents measurements for different temperatures , @xcite . similarly , direct temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath0 in polycrystalline superconducting samples allows us to determine , with high precision , the magnetic field dependence of @xmath0 for different fixed temperatures .    in the experimental procedure ,",
    "partially explained in references @xcite , the temperature is slowly raised by natural heating during the experiment , while the external magnetic field is kept constant . in this way , a set of temperature dependent susceptibility data is obtained .",
    "changing the magnetic field , a new set of data @xmath42 , with @xmath32 taken as a parameter , is obtained .",
    "all these data @xmath43 , corresponding to different applied magnetic fields , generate a surface in the @xmath32-@xmath44-@xmath0 space and define the susceptibility @xmath45 .",
    "a series of @xmath46-based samples were prepared by standard solid state reactions .",
    "the mixture of high purity @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 powders were ground , pelleted at a pressure of @xmath50 and pre - fired at @xmath51 for 24 hours .",
    "this procedure was repeated three times for heating temperatures of @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "an extra sintering of compact pellets in oxygen flow at @xmath55 for @xmath56 was followed by a slow cooling in oxygen flow .",
    "the cooling rate of this stage was varied in order to get two samples with different grain sizes . in figure 1",
    "we observe the different structures of samples g and b that will be analyzed in this paper  sample b with grains separated by inter granular dark regions and sample g , with closely packed grains and a minimum spacing between them ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the samples were cut and polished in the shape of thin disks and then mounted on cooper paste in order to decrease the temperature gradient .",
    "the temperature of the sample was measured with a platinum resistor and a lake shore detector .",
    "these samples were cooled in an apd scs cryostat adapted for @xmath57 susceptibility measurements .",
    "the output signal was processed with a lock - in amplifier .    in figure 2",
    ", the susceptibilities of samples g and b , are plotted together to make evident the influence of the physical structure on the behavior of @xmath4 as a function of the temperature and the external magnetic field . in the case of sample b",
    ", @xmath0 takes relatively low values even for a low temperature ( @xmath58 ) and zero magnetic field ( see figure 5 ) , and the constant temperature susceptibility as a function of the magnetic field decreases with visible oscillations due to the josephson junction effects .",
    "the susceptibility reduces rapidly with increasing temperature , from @xmath59 ( at @xmath60 ) to @xmath61 ( at @xmath62 ) . at @xmath63 , the magnetic field effect on @xmath0 is weaker because some junctions are already disconnected and @xmath0 is controlled mainly by the diamagnetic properties of the grains .",
    "the high - temperature curve oscillates with the magnetic field less than the low temperature curve for the same reason .",
    "the susceptibility shown in figure 6 for sample g exhibits a completely different behavior and higher values ( @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) .",
    "it is obvious that the intergrain currents can flow easier through short junctions , and thus screen the external magnetic field more efficiently .",
    "the susceptibility decreases with the magnetic field , but without visible oscillations .",
    "the reduced width of the josephson junctions does not permit an appreciable penetration of the magnetic field into them .",
    "the decrease of @xmath0 with temperature corresponds to an increase of the type iii regions , where vortices of the external magnetic field can penetrate .",
    ".parameters used to fit data , in figures 5 and 6 and some estimated geometrical parameters .",
    "we give here the critical temperature @xmath67 , the effective grain and loop areas @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the critical exponent @xmath68 , the decoherence length @xmath69 at @xmath70 , and the susceptibility @xmath71 at @xmath72 .. we give also the estimated values of the josephson junction and loop effective radius @xmath40 , @xmath41 , for samples b and g. [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath73 within the fitting resolution negligible loop contribution is found .    in all cases",
    ", it was possible to fit the data by choosing the values of @xmath74 , @xmath17 , @xmath75 , @xmath30 and @xmath76 , as indicated in table [ tablita ] . besides the sample - dependent ( zero field and zero temperature ) scaling susceptibility factor @xmath76 , which comprises the global magnetic field response , the critical exponent @xmath30 , the decoherence length @xmath75 , and the josephson junction and loop effective areas values ,",
    "correspond quite well to the samples characteristics . in the case of sample b ( see figure 5 ) the adjustment is not exact , due to the irregular shapes of the grains and junctions .",
    "the fitting is far more better for sample g , where the loops of currents do not play an important role ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "the major difference within the parameter values in table [ tablita ] appears in the parameter @xmath17 , which for sample g is practically vanishing , while for sample b it has a relatively high value . in sample",
    "b the porous structure forces the cooper pairs to larger loops around the intergrain regions v. on the contrary , in sample b such loops are not necessary because the grains are arranged very closely .    concerning the critical exponent @xmath30 appearing in the polynomial and exponential temperature dependent factors , we notice that their values remain between @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( increasing with the magnetic field ) , as was found already in previous reports , where the order parameter was shown to decay exponentially because of the intergrain tunneling process .",
    "finally , the fitting values of the decoherence length @xmath75 , are more or less the same for both samples and , as expected , grow with the magnetic field .",
    "in this paper we studied another physical quantity characterizing the polycrystalline superconductors electromagnetic properties .",
    "we show that , as for the critical transport currents , the josephson and loop s interfering currents have , depending on the sample quality , different degrees of influence on the magnetic field response .",
    "the susceptibility of equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) gives reasonably good predictions on its behavior as a function of the temperature and the external magnetic field .",
    "the oscillations of @xmath4 , observed experimentally , are well explained on the basis of the quantum interference theory , the exponential suppression of the order parameter induced by tunneling processes , and the polynomial temperature dependence known from the standard theory .",
