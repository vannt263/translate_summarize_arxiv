    "the properties of arrays of josephson junctions have been of great interest for nearly twenty years.@xcite such arrays are excellent model systems in which to study such phenomena as phase transitions and quantum coherence in two dimensions .",
    "for example , if only the josephson coupling energy is considered , the hamiltonian of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) array of josephson junctions is formally identical to that of a 2d xy model [ see , e. g. ref . ] .",
    "arrays sometimes appear to mimic behavior seen in nominally homogeneous materials , such as high-@xmath4 superconductors , which often behave as if they are composed of distinct superconducting regions linked together by josephson coupling.@xcite finally , the arrays are of potentially practical interest : they may be useful , for example , as sources of coherent microwave radiation if the individual junctions can be caused to oscillate in phase in a stable manner .",
    "recently , our ability to achieve this kind of stable oscillation , and coherent microwave radiation , was significantly advanced by a series of experiments by barbara and collaborators.@xcite these workers placed two - dimensional underdamped josephson arrays in a geometry which allowed them to be coupled to a resonant microwave cavity .",
    "the presence of the cavity caused the junctions to couple together far more efficiently than in its absence . as a result , the power radiated into the cavity has been found to be as much as 30% of the d.  c.  power injected into the array , far higher than the efficiency achieved in previous experiments .",
    "even more surprising , this efficiency is achieved in _ underdamped _ arrays , which according to conventional wisdom should be especially difficult to synchronize , since each such junction exhibits bistability and hysteresis as a function of the external control parameters .",
    "these experiments have stimulated many theoretical attempts to explain them.@xcite    in our previous work , we have presented a simple _ one - dimensional _",
    "( 1d ) model which seems to account for many features of the observed cavity - induced coherence.@xcite despite the geometrical differences , the 1d model does a surprisingly good job of capturing the physics of the experiments .",
    "however , a truly realistic test requires that the model be extended to a geometry closer to the experimental one . in this paper , therefore , we present the necessary extension to 2d .",
    "our results give significant insight into why the 1d model works so well .",
    "in addition , they provide some clues about how one might understand experimental features which are still unexplained in either the 1d or the 2d models .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe our model hamiltonian for a 2d current - driven , underdamped josephson junction array in a resonant cavity which supports a single mode .",
    "this hamiltonian is a straightforward extension of that used in our previous work to describe 1d arrays . in section iii , using this hamiltonian , we write out the heisenberg equations of motion for the junction variables and for the photon creation and annihilation operators for the cavity mode .",
    "we incorporate resistive dissipation in the junctions in a standard way , by coupling the gauge - invariant phase differences across each junction to its own set of harmonic oscillator variables whose spectral density is chosen to produce ohmic dissipation . in the limit of large numbers of photons , we obtain classical equations of motion for the variables . in section iv , we present the numerical solutions of this model with an emphasis on features special to 2d , and we also give a comparison between the 2d and previous 1d results . a concluding discussion and comparison with experiment follows in section v.",
    "we will consider a 2d array of @xmath5 superconducting grains placed in a resonant cavity , which we assume supports only a single photon mode of frequency @xmath1 .",
    "the array is thus made up of @xmath6 square plaquettes .",
    "there are a total of @xmath7 horizontal junctions , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "a current @xmath10 is fed into each of the @xmath11 grains on the left edge of the array , and extracted from each of the @xmath11 grains on the right edge .",
    "thus , the current is inject in the @xmath12 direction , with no external current injected in the @xmath13 direction .",
    "a sketch of this geometry is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dgeometry ] .",
    "we also introduce the terminology that a `` row '' of junctions , in this configuration , refers to a group of @xmath14 junctions , all with left - hand end having the same @xmath12 coordinate , and all being parallel to the bias current .",
    "one such row is indicated by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dgeometry ] .",
    "in contrast to our previous work,@xcite we will write the equations of motion for the grain variables ( phases and charges ) rather than junction variables , since in 2d , the junction variables can not be treated as all independent ( there are twice as many junctions as grains ) .",

    "the other parameters are @xmath151 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath184 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 . as the number of active rows on the sirs s increases , @xmath185 .",
    "[ also , of course , @xmath186 for _ one _ active row on a sirs . ] numerically , we find that it is easier in 2d than in 1d to achieve a state with all active junctions biased on a sirs , but with @xmath187 . in all such cases , we can easily cause @xmath188 simply by increasing @xmath110 .        the threshold shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:40x_thresh ] corresponds to a transition from a state in which _",
    "none _ of the active junctions are on sirs s to a state in which _ all _ are on sirs s .",
    "it is possible to choose @xmath155 so as to have _ any number _ of active rows @xmath133 on sirs s . in this case , the cavity energy @xmath163 , in our model , is approximately quadratic in @xmath133 , with no obvious threshold behavior .",
    "this feature of our results is discussed further below .",
    "we have also investigated the case of @xmath189 , @xmath190 , for a wide range range of @xmath111 values . for our geometry",
    ", we have not been able to find _ any _ value for @xmath111 for which a sirs develops .",
    "in essence , when the cavity couples _ only _ to the vertical junctions , it is invisible in the iv characteristics .",
    "this behavior is easily understood . in this geometry , with current applied in the @xmath12 direction , both the time - averaged voltage and the time - averaged current through the vertical junctions are very small .",
    "hence , too little power is dissipated in the vertical junctions to induce a resonance with the cavity .",
    "to illustrate this behavior , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dperiodicity ] some representative phase plots of @xmath191 for ( a ) a vertical junction and ( b ) a horizontal junction in a @xmath119 array with @xmath189 , @xmath192 , @xmath140 , @xmath121 , @xmath193 , @xmath127 at bias current @xmath194 ( close to a possible resonance with cavity ) .",
    "the phase plot for the vertical junction exhibits small - amplitude aperiodic motion , while that of the horizontal junction shows that this junction is in its active state and undergoing periodic motion in phase space .",
    "this lack of response by the @xmath13 junctions to the cavity probably explains why the 1d simulations describe the experiments so well .",
    "it is no surprise that the cavity interacts only very weakly with the vertical junctions . from previous studies of both underdamped and overdamped disordered josephson arrays in a rectangular geometry ( see , e. g. , refs .  , and )",
    ", it is known that when current is applied in the @xmath12 direction , the @xmath13 junctions remain superconducting , with @xmath195 , while the @xmath12 junctions comprising an active row are almost perfectly synchronized , with @xmath196 .    if there were an an external magnetic field _",
    "perpendicular _ to the array , we believe that sirs s would be generated for @xmath190 , even if @xmath189 . in this case , the magnetic field would induce frustration . specifically , since the sum of the gauge invariant phase differences around a plaquette must be an integer multiple of @xmath197 , the presence of magnetic - field - induced vortices piercing the plaquettes would induce nonzero voltages across , and supercurrents in , the @xmath13 junctions .",
    "it would be of great interest if calculations were carried out in such applied magnetic fields .",
    "we now compare our 2d results explicitly with those for 1d arrays . in our earlier 1d model",
    ", we found numerically@xcite that the threshold number of active junctions @xmath3 was inversely proportional to the coupling constant @xmath198 .",
    "this behavior is reasonable because the inhomogeneous term driving the cavity variable @xmath199 is proportional to the product of @xmath198 and @xmath133 .",
    "some of our numerical trends in the 2d case can be understood similarly .",
    "for example , the inhomogeneous term in eq.([eq:2dsolve2 ] ) is the last term on the right - hand side .",
    "it is proportional to the sum of the coupling constants @xmath109 over _ all _ the junctions parallel to @xmath155 .",
    "thus , for @xmath117 , @xmath200 , and for the same driving current @xmath155 , we expect that an @xmath201 array with a coupling constant @xmath110 should behave like an @xmath202 array with coupling constant @xmath158 .",
    "array ( @xmath203 ) and a @xmath204 array ( @xmath205 ) .",

    "the @xmath204 array has @xmath208 = 0.00259 , and the other parameters are the same as for the @xmath209 array .",
    "the iv characteristics are shown for both increasing and decreasing current drive , as discussed in the text.,height=264 ]    to check this hypothesis , we compare , in fig .",
    "[ fig:10x_iv ] , the iv characteristics of a @xmath210 array having coupling constant @xmath211 with those of a @xmath204 array with coupling constant @xmath212 .",
    "the other parameters are the same for the two arrays : @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath121 and @xmath127 .",
    "the expected positions of the sirs s [ at @xmath213 are indicated by dashed horizontal lines .",
    "indeed , the two sets of iv characteristics are very similar .",
    "even some of the subtle differences can be understood in a simple way .",
    "for example , the @xmath214 iv s are slightly flatter than the @xmath215 curves .",
    "we believe this extra flatness occurs because the individual junction couplings in the @xmath215 array are @xmath216 times larger than those in the @xmath217 array . from our previous 1d simulations ,",
    "the iv s on the steps become more and more rounded as @xmath110 increases , i. e. , the voltage on the lower portion of the sirs is no longer independent of @xmath155 [ cf . ref .  ] .",
    "precisely this behavior is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:10x_iv ] .",
    "another subtle difference between the 1d and 2d curves of fig.[fig:10x_iv ] is the values of the so - called `` retrapping current '' in the two sets of curves ( i. e. the current values below which the mccumber curve becomes unstable ) .",
    "we believe that this difference can be understood in terms of the effects of disorder in the junction critical currents in 1d and 2d .",
    "specifically , for a given value of @xmath218 , the 2d arrays are effectively less disordered than the 1d arrays , since the _ average _ critical current for a single row has a smaller rms spread than the critical current of a single junction in a 1d array .",
    "an important similarity between the two sets of curves is that , in both the @xmath204 and the @xmath210 arrays , the width of the sirs s varies similarly ( and non - monotonically ) with the number of active rows .",
    "this behavior distinguishes our predictions from some other models,@xcite in which the cavity is modeled as an rlc oscillator connected in parallel to the entire array , and which predicts a monotonic dependence of sirs width on @xmath133 .",
    "@xcite    , for a @xmath210 array and a @xmath204 array for the same choice of array parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig:10x_iv ] .",
    "the calculations are carried out on the decreasing current branch with all rows active .",
    "note that @xmath110 for the @xmath204 array is 10 times smaller than that of the @xmath210 array.,height=264 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig:10x_cav ] we plot the reduced time - averaged cavity energy @xmath219 as a function of @xmath220 for both arrays of fig .",
    "[ fig:10x_iv ] , under conditions such that all rows are active .",
    "this plot is obtained by following the decreasing current branch .",
    "surprisingly , when the @xmath204 array ( with @xmath221 ) locks on to the sirs , @xmath222 jumps to a value which is approximately two orders of magnitude _ larger _ than that of the corresponding jump in the @xmath210 array , even though the parameter @xmath158 is the same for both arrays .",
    "we believe that the difference is due simply to the greater number of junctions which are driving the cavity in the 2d case .",
    "even though the _ width _ of the steps is controlled primarily by the parameter @xmath158 , the energy in the cavity is determined by the _",
    "square _ of the number of radiating junctions .",
    "this square is _ 100 times larger _ for the 2d array than for the 1d array .",
    "in this paper , we have derived equations of motions for a 2d array of underdamped josephson junctions in a single - mode resonant cavity , starting from a suitable model hamiltonian and including the effects of both a current drive and resistive dissipation . in the limit of zero junction - cavity coupling , these equations of motion correctly reduce to those describing a 2d array of resistively and capacitively shunted josephson junctions .    as in our previous 1d model , the present equations of motion lead to a transition from incoherence to coherence , as a function of the number of active rows @xmath133 .",
    "this transition again results from the effectively mean - field - like nature of the interaction between the junctions and the cavity . specifically , because each junction is , in effect , coupled to every other active junction via the cavity , the strength of the effective coupling is proportional to the number of active junctions .",
    "thus , for any @xmath223 , no matter how small , a transition to coherence is to be expected for sufficiently large number of active rows @xmath133 .",
    "we also found a striking effect of polarization : the transition to coherence occurs only when the cavity mode is polarized so that its electric field has a component parallel to the direction of current flow .",
    "next , we briefly compare our numerical results to the behavior seen in experiments.@xcite our calculations show the following features seen in experiments : ( i ) self - induced resonant steps ( sirs s ) in the iv characteristics ; ( ii ) a transition from incoherence to coherence above a threshold number of active junctions ; and ( iii ) a total energy in the cavity which varies quadratically with the number of active junctions when those junctions are locked onto sirs s . there may , however , be some differences as well .",
    "in particular , our transition to a quadratic behavior occurs when the active junctions are locked onto sirs s .",
    "in possible contrast to our results , in some experimental arrays,@xcite it has been reported that even _",
    "below _ the `` coherence threshold , '' individual rows of junctions are locked onto sirs s , but these sirs s are not coherent with one another , and hence , do not radiate an amount of power into the cavity proportional to the square of the number of junctions on the sirs s . thus far , in our calculations , we have found that when @xmath133 junctions are locked onto the steps , the energy in the cavity is quadratic in @xmath133 .",
    "the threshold , in our calculations , occurs when all the active junctions lock onto sirs s , _ not _ when active junctions which are already locked onto sirs s become coherent with one another .    for some choices of the parameters @xmath110 , @xmath224 , @xmath218 , @xmath225 , and @xmath155 , we find dynamical states such that all active rows lock onto sirs s while @xmath226 .",
    "in such states , the kuramoto order parameter for the _ individual rows _ is still @xmath227 , implying that the rows are not perfectly phase - locked to each other .",
    "an example of such a state is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kuram_small ] . in such states ,",
    "our calculated energy @xmath222 in the cavity appears to vary smoothly with @xmath133 , and exhibits no threshold behavior , in contrast to what we find at other applied currents [ cf .",
    "[ fig:40x_thresh ] ] . this behavior appears to differ from what was reported experimentally in a recent paper;@xcite the reasons for the difference are not clear to us .    in summary , we have extended our previous theory of josephson junction arrays coupled to a resonant cavity to the case of 2d arrays .",
    "the 2d theory bears many similarities to the 1d case , and makes clear why the 1d model works so well .",
    "these similarities arise because , in a square array , the coupling to the cavity takes place only through those junctions which are parallel to the applied current .",
    "again as in 1d , our model leads to clearly defined sirs s whose voltages are proportional to the resonant frequency of the cavity .",
    "another similarity is that , in 2d as in 1d , when a fixed number of rows are biased on a sirs , the cavity energy is linear in the input power .",
    "we also find some results which are specific to 2d .",
    "for example , whenever one junction in a given row is biased on a sirs , all the junctions in that row phase - lock onto that same sirs . in addition , the time - averaged energy contained in the resonant cavity is quadratic in the number of active rows , but , when the array is biased on a sirs , is much _ larger _ in the 2d array than in the 1d array , for the same value of the coupling parameter @xmath228 .    when the cavity mode is polarized perpendicular to the direction of current drive , we find that the cavity does not affect the array iv characteristics .",
    "our equations suggest that this non - effect might change if the array were frustrated , e. g. , by an external magnetic field normal to the array . such frustration would cause junctions in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 direction to be coupled .",
    "it would be of great interest if this speculation could be tested experimentally .",
