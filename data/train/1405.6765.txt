    "since quantum mechanics principles are introduced into cryptography , quantum cryptography attracts more and more attention . due to the characteristic of quantum unconditional security , many quantum cryptography protocols , such as quantum key distribution ( qkd ) [ 1 - 3 ] , quantum direct communication ( qdc ) [ 4 - 7 ] , quantum secret sharing ( qss ) [ 8 - 10 ]",
    ", quantum teleportation ( qt ) [ 11,12 ] , have been proposed to solve various secure problems .",
    "recently , quantum private comparison ( qpc ) has become an important branch in quantum cryptography . based on the properties of quantum mechanics",
    ", the participants can determine whether their secret inputs are equal or not without disclosing their own secrets to each other .",
    "in 2009 , yang et al . [ 13 ] put forward a pioneering qpc scheme based on bell states and a hash function . since then , a large number of qpc protocols utilizing the entangled states , such as epr pairs , ghz state , etc .",
    ", have been proposed [ 14 - 23 ]",
    ".    however , these qpc protocols [ 13 - 23 ] are feasible in the ideal scenario but not secure in practical scenario where faults ( including noise and error ) are existent in the quantum channel and measurement . in order to solve the problem , in 2013 , li et al .",
    "[ 24 ] present a novel qpc scheme based on ghz states and error - correcting code ( ecc ) against noise .",
    "but , through analyzing li et al.s qpc scheme , we find it is unsecure under a special attack , called the twice - hadamard - cnot attack . to be specific ,",
    "if any malicious party performed the twice - hadamard - cnot attack , he ( she ) can get another s secret input , which goes against the qpc s principles [ 25 ] . in order to fix the loophole , a simple solution by adopting a permutation operator before tp distributes the particles to the participants , is proposed .",
    "the rest of this paper is constructed as follows . at first , li et al.s qpc protocol is briefly reviewed in sect .",
    "2 . and in sect .",
    "3 , we analyze the security of li et al.s qpc protocol by introducing the twice - hadmard - cnot attack , and give an improvement to fix the problem . finally , a short collusion is drawn in sect .",
    "in the ref . [ 24 ] , in order to guarantee the qpc protocols secure in the practical scenario , li et al . present a new two - party qpc scheme by using error - correcting code .",
    "the whole protocol consists of eight steps as below .    1 .",
    "alice , bob and calvin prepare a [ @xmath0 error - correcting code which uses @xmath1 bits codeword to encode @xmath2 bits word and can correct @xmath3 error bits in codeword with the error - correcting function @xmath4 according to the fault rate of the noise scenario .",
    "we suppose the error - correcting code s generator matrix is @xmath5 , and check matrix is @xmath6 .",
    "then they encode @xmath7 and @xmath8 to @xmath9 and @xmath10 with the generator matrix @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "there are @xmath11 @xmath12 2 .",
    "calvin prepares @xmath1 triplet ghz states all in @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are measured in @xmath16 basis , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are measured in @xmath19 basis , and @xmath20 .",
    "calvin divides these @xmath1 ghz states into three sequences @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which includes the first , the second , and the third particles of all ghz states , respectively .",
    "3 .   calvin prepares some decoy photons prepared in states @xmath24 in random .",
    "he inserts these decoy photons in @xmath21 and @xmath22 at random positions to form sequences @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "calvin retains the quantum sequence @xmath23 and sends the sequence @xmath25 to alice , @xmath26 to bob .",
    "4 .   when alice and bob receive @xmath25 and @xmath26 , calvin announces the positions and measurement base of these decoy photons .",
    "alice and bob measure them in the same base and announce their outcome .",
    "if the error rate exceeds a rational threshold , calvin aborts the protocol and restarts from step ( 1 ) . otherwise , there is no eavesdropper , and the protocol continues to the next step .",
    "alice and bob recover @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively by discarding the decoy photons .",
    "then alice , bob and calvin measure @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 in @xmath19 basis , respectively .",
    "if the measurement result is @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , then they encode it as the classical bit 0 ( 1 ) .",
    "thus , each of alice , bob and calvin will obtain @xmath1 bits from @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "we denote each of them as @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( i=0,1, ... ,m-1 ) . 6 .",
    "alice and bob calculate @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "they announce @xmath32 and @xmath33 to calvin .",
    "calvin calculates @xmath34 , and gets @xmath1 bits sequence @xmath35 .",
    ".   then calvin uses the check matrix @xmath6 to check whether the number of error bits exceeds the threshold @xmath3 .",
    "if it does , calvin aborts the protocol and restarts from step ( 1 ) .",
    "otherwise , he gets @xmath2 bits sequence @xmath36 by decoding @xmath37 with error - correcting function @xmath38 .",
    "if there is at least one bit 1 in @xmath36 , calvin announces @xmath39 .",
    "otherwise , he announces @xmath40 .    in ref .",
    "[ 24 ] , the authors claimed the scheme was secure even in the practical scenario .",
    "however , we will show how a malicious party gets the other s secret input by launching the twice - hadmard - cnot attack in the next section .",
    "as analyzed in ref.[24 ] , due to the decoy photons adopted in the li et al.s qpc protocol , some well - known attacks , such as intercept - resend attack , measurement - resend attack , and entanglement - resend attack , can be detected via the checking mechanism .",
    "unfortunately , we find li et al.s qpc protocol can not resist a special attack , i.e. , the twice - hadmard - cnot attack . to be specific ,",
    "if any party ( alice or bob ) performs the twice - hadmard - cnot attack , he / she can get the other s secret input .",
    "the detailed procedure of the twice - hadmard - cnot attack is depicted as follows .    without loss of generality , we suppose bob is malicious , who wants to get alice s secret input . at first ,",
    "bob prepares @xmath1 auxiliary particles all in the state @xmath41 , then , the ghz state and an auxiliary particle compose a composite system : @xmath42 where the subscript @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 represent the particles in the hand of calvin , alice , bob , respectively , and the subscript @xmath46 represents the auxiliary particle .    in step ( 3 ) , when calvin sends the sequence @xmath25 to alice , bob may intercept @xmath25 and execute a hardmard ( @xmath47 ) operation on every particle in @xmath25 to form sequence @xmath48 . then , he performs a controlled - not ( cnot ) operation @xmath49 on every particle in @xmath48 and the corresponding auxiliary particle @xmath46 . here , the particle in @xmath48 is the control qubit , while particle @xmath46 is the target qubit .",
    "after that , bob performs another @xmath47 operation on every particle in @xmath48 in order to restore sequence @xmath48 to @xmath25 , and sends @xmath25 to alice .",
    "what should be noted is that the transmitting sequence @xmath25 remains unchanged .",
    "since calvin announces the decoy photons positions in step ( 4 ) , bob can discard the auxiliary particles @xmath46 which correspond to the decoy photons in @xmath25 . and in step ( 5 ) , after bob recovers @xmath22 by discarding the decoy photons , he executes an @xmath47 operation on every particle in @xmath22 to form sequence @xmath50 .",
    "then bob performs a cnot operation @xmath51 on every particle ( control particle ) in @xmath50 and the corresponding auxiliary particle @xmath46 ( target particle ) .",
    "after that , he performs a @xmath47 operation on every particle in @xmath50 , which aims to restore @xmath50 to @xmath22 , and every auxiliary particle , respectively .",
    "now , the state of the composite system is changed into @xmath52 from eq.(5 ) , a rule can be concluded : if @xmath46 is @xmath17 , particle @xmath44 and particle @xmath45 are in the same state ; and if @xmath46 is @xmath18 , they are in the different states .    after alice announces @xmath32 in step ( 6 ) , bob measures them in the @xmath19 basis , and get the measurement result @xmath53 .",
    "according to @xmath54 and the rule from eq.(5 ) , bob can obtain alice s states @xmath55 .",
    "since @xmath56 has been announced by alice , bob can calculate @xmath57 , that is to say , he can get alice s secret input @xmath58 .    for sake of clearness",
    ", the above procedure of the twice - hadmard - cnot attack can be intuitively demonstrated by the following figure ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .     is a ghz state in the state @xmath59 shared by calvin , alice and bob .",
    "@xmath47 is hadmard operation , and   represents the controlled - not gate in which the top line denotes the control qubit , the bottom line the target qubit . ]      in order to fix the loophole of li et al.s qpc protocol , we meliorate it by applying a permutation operator before tp sends the particle sequences to all the participants . to be specific , step ( 3 ) , step ( 4 ) and step ( 5 ) in the original protocol need to be revised as follows .    1 .",
    "calvin prepares two group @xmath60-length decoy photons sequences at random in @xmath61 , namely @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and concatenates them with @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) to form an extended sequence @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) , respectively",
    ". then calvin applies a permutation operator @xmath66 on @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) to create a new sequence @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) , and sends the new sequence @xmath25 to alice , @xmath26 to bob .",
    "2 .   when alice and bob receive @xmath25 and @xmath26 , calvin announces the coordinates of the decoy qubits @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) send by him , and the corresponding measurement bases .",
    "note that calvin does not disclose the actual order of the message qubits .",
    "then alice and bob measure these decoy qubits in the same bases and announce their outcomes . if the error rate exceeds a rational threshold , calvin aborts the protocol and restarts from step ( 1 ) ; otherwise , there is no eavesdropper , and the protocol continues to the next step .",
    "alice and bob discard their decoy photons , and denote the left qubits in their hands as @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( i.e.,@xmath75 ) , respectively .",
    "then alice , bob and calvin measure @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath23 in the @xmath19 basis , respectively , and obtain @xmath1 bits , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( i=0,1, ... ,m-1 ) , respectively . after they have completed measurement operation , calvin immediately announces the actual order of the message qubits @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "using this information , alice ( bob ) can rearrange @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) in correspondence with the original order of @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "let us examine the security of our improvement under the twice - hadmard - cnot attack .",
    "similarly , we suppose the malicious bob aims to get alice s secret input . in step @xmath78 , since calvin disrupts the sequences @xmath67 and @xmath68 by using @xmath66 to get @xmath25 , @xmath26 , it means the order of transmited sequences @xmath25 , @xmath26 is fully disturbed . and after discarding the decoy qubits @xmath62 and @xmath63 in step @xmath79 , alice and bob can only get @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and can not recover the original sequences @xmath21 and @xmath22 because that @xmath76 is only known by calvin .",
    "so , even if bob launch the twice - hadmard - cnot attack , he can not get the final state @xmath80 .",
    "that is to say , bob can not get the correlations between alice s and bob s qubits by measuring the auxiliary particles @xmath46 .    for simplicity",
    ", we take a simple two - bit private comparisonas example without considering error - correcting code and the decoy photos . in the case , suppose alice s input is 10 , bob s input is 11 , and calvin prepares two ghz states all in the state as eq.(3 ) , @xmath81 in step @xmath78 , calvin executes a permutation operator @xmath82 on sequence @xmath67 and @xmath68 , then the system may be changed into @xmath83 after bob performs the twice - hadmard - cnot attack , the composite system which consists of ghz state and auxiliary particle becomes @xmath84 from above equation , we can not get the correlations between the states of @xmath85 or @xmath86 according to the the final state of the auxiliary particle @xmath87 or @xmath88 .",
    "that means , bob can not steal alice s input through measuring the auxiliary particles .",
    "so , we can say the improvement can resist the twice - hadmard - cnot attack .",
    "in all the qpc protocols , in order to ensure the protocol s security , we must guarantee any participant only knows his ( her ) own secret input without obtaining another secret input . in this paper",
    ", we firstly review and analyze li et al.s two - party qpc protocol , and find it can not resist the twice - hadmard - cnot attack , i.e. , if one participant bob launches this attack , he ( she ) can get the other s secret input without being detected . for avoiding this loophole , we adopt the permutation operator to rearranges the quantum sequences sent to alice and bob from charlie .",
    "the delicate analysis shows the security of our improvement can be guaranteed well and truly .",
