    "among the lightest nuclei , research of the structure and decay of the @xmath0he states is one of the most intriguing phenomena of modern nuclear physics . numerous theoretical studies ( see the ajzenberg - selove @xcite and tilley _ et al . _",
    "@xcite compilations ) were directed towards determining the resonant structure nature of @xmath0he .",
    "the low - lying @xmath0he@xmath7 excited states decay into the @xmath3he+2n three - cluster channel , whose threshold energy is 0.974 mev , while the high - lying @xmath0he@xmath7 excited states appear to decay into the @xmath2h+@xmath2h two - cluster channel , whose threshold energy is 12.305 mev .",
    "moreover , in the interval between these two threshold energies for the @xmath1 + 2n and t+t decay channels , the compilation @xcite shows only one narrow 1.8 mev excited state while the compilation @xcite also shows the presence of the 5.6 mev excited state ( see fig .",
    "[ f1levels ] ) with a very large @xmath6 width of 12.1 mev . at first",
    ", these low - lying excited levels were examined as soft dipole resonances @xcite consisting of an oscillation of two neutrons with respect to the @xmath1-cluster . in subsequent theoretical calculations @xcite the above - mentioned @xmath0he@xmath7 excited states",
    "were considered to be three - body continuum states .",
    "in addition , many experimental and theoretical studies@xcite were devoted to study the energy levels in @xmath0he , but the obtained results are quite controversial for the excited states above the 2@xmath10 level at 1.797 mev .",
    "the experimental investigations of the low - lying excited states of @xmath0he were concentrated on the analysis of inclusive spectra measured in charge - exchange @xmath0li(@xmath11li,@xmath11be)@xmath0he @xcite and @xmath0li(t,@xmath2he)@xmath0he @xcite reactions , while in the recent p(@xmath12he , t ) reaction@xcite the low - lying @xmath0he@xmath7 excited states were investigated by an inverse kinematic experiment via a 2-neutron transfer reaction , by analyzing the energy spectra of tritons .    in the experiments where the information on the excitation of missing nuclei is extracted from inclusive spectra a correct procedure of accounting for the non - resonant background and all resonance contributions due to other reaction channels",
    "is needed . at the same time , the analysis carried out in papers @xcite contained the series of contradictory suppositions in relation to the selection and accounting for the background contributions .",
    "for example , the non - resonance background in the ( @xmath11li,@xmath11be ) reaction was calculated but it was not measured , while in paper @xcite the background contributions were not taken into account in general . in order to remove the background contributions it is necessary to consider the degrees of freedom connected with the excitation of both nuclei in the incident channel and reaction products in the exit channel .",
    "the @xmath0he nucleus has a distinctive three - cluster feature at low - energy excited states .",
    "it has one loosely bound ground state with the energy of -0.974 mev with respect to the @xmath1+n+n three - cluster threshold and there are no bound states in any two - cluster subsystems .",
    "another light nucleus with a strong three - cluster features is @xmath0be , and the investigation of the three - cluster resonance nature of the @xmath0he and @xmath0be nuclei is particularly important because it is possible to obtain information on the role of the large excess of neutrons in the case of the @xmath0he nucleus and the large excess of protons in the case of @xmath0be , in connection with the characteristics and nature of the low - lying three - cluster resonance states for these two mirror nuclei . on the other hand , it is also interesting to promote experimental investigations of the low - lying excited state of @xmath0be ( mirror nucleus of @xmath0he ) where no threshold energy exists for the @xmath1+p+p three - cluster formation .",
    "an appropriate and elaborate procedure was used in the investigation of the photonuclear @xmath11li(@xmath13 , p)@xmath0he reaction @xcite by using the population of excited levels created in the photonuclear reaction@xcite .",
    "in addition , compilation @xcite gives very broad @xmath6 width values for @xmath0he@xmath7 excited states up to high @xmath5 excitation energies ( see for example the papers@xcite ) , only with the exclusion of the very narrow low - lying first excited state at @xmath14  mev .",
    "therefore , we decided to investigate the low - lying excited @xmath0he@xmath7 states just above the 0.974 mev threshold energy value populating the @xmath1 + 2n channel in order to observe and resolve the presence of other possible low - lying @xmath0he@xmath7 excited states by analysis of the ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) bidimensional coincidence spectra of the @xmath2h(@xmath3he , p@xmath1)2n reaction .",
    "to this aim we needed to work with a relatively low beam energy , but high enough to explore the excited @xmath0he@xmath7 states just above the mentioned @xmath1 + 2n threshold energy value , because by increasing the beam energy the contributions from other concurrent channels also increase .",
    "therefore , higher beam energies lead to a worse determination of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 widths . in such cases , it is impossible to resolve two neighboring distinguished @xmath0he@xmath7 excited states .",
    "in fact , some difficulties also exist in the analysis of two particle coincidence spectra if all resonant contributions due to the concurrent reaction channels that lead to the same final products are not considered and resolved .",
    "moreover , in paper @xcite we discussed the difficulty of reaching reliable @xmath5 and @xmath6 measurements by analysis of single ( inclusive ) particle spectra due to the huge and difficult estimation of the complete background present in such spectra .",
    "in fact , in the analysis of single particle spectra , the modest yield of a possible resonant contribution may not appear , and one might observe only a large single resonant yield instead of a resolved feature without an adequate analysis of the various contributions due to the concurrent channels . in the latter case , the single large resonant contribution appears as the convolution of various resonant contributions due to the population of : i ) different excited states of the same nucleus , ii ) excited states of other nuclei formed in intermediate steps of the reaction , and iii ) other reaction mechanisms , but all leading to the same final products .    by taking into account all of the above - mentioned reasons , we decided to study the low - lying @xmath0he@xmath7 excited states by analyzing the ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) bidimensional coincidence spectra of the @xmath2h(@xmath3he , p@xmath1)2n four - body reaction at @xmath15 beam energy of 27.2 mev produced by the y-120 cyclotron accelerator . at this beam energy",
    "we can explore the low excitation energy region of @xmath0he@xmath7 just above the @xmath1 + 2n threshold energy with well controlled experimental and analysis conditions .",
    "in order to study the @xmath2h(@xmath3he , p@xmath1)2n reaction by the analysis of ( @xmath8 ,  @xmath9 ) bidimensional spectra , we used the apparatus described in our previous work @xcite where the target made of titanium backing ( 2.6 mg/@xmath16 thick ) saturated with tritium ( equivalent to the thickness of about 0.15 mg/@xmath16 ) was used , while in the present experiment the @xmath3he - particle beam of @xmath17 mev was produced by the cyclotron accelerator y-120 of the institute for nuclear research in kiev .",
    "the gas of tritium diffused through the titanim backing was pure at 99.9  % .",
    "the impurities of 0.1 % can be due to the presence of hydrogen h and deuterium @xmath18h .",
    "the h(@xmath3he , p)@xmath1 reaction is an elastic scattering process ( @xmath19-value = 0  mev ) , and the @xmath18h(@xmath3he , p@xmath1)n reaction is a three - body ( p , @xmath1 , n ) reaction with @xmath19-value = @xmath20  mev .",
    "this value is different with respect to the studied @xmath2h(@xmath3he , p@xmath1)2n four - body ( p , @xmath1 , 2n ) reaction with @xmath19-value = @xmath21  mev .    to detect the products of the @xmath3he+@xmath2h reaction and to avoid the coincidence events related to the particles present in the above - mentioned reaction that are not of our interest , we used two @xmath22 telescopes placed at the left and right sides with respect to the beam direction defined as the polar axis . therefore , the identification and energy determination of outgoing p and @xmath1 charged particles with an energy resolution of about 100 kev allowed us to obtain the ( @xmath8 ,  @xmath9 ) bidimensional spectra of the coincidence events .",
    "the telescope placed on the left side consisted of @xmath23 ( 25 @xmath24 m thick totally depleted silicon surface barrier detector ( ssd ) ) and e [ si(li ) with 1mm@xmath25 , 261 mm from the target ] detectors to identify and separate @xmath1-particles of energy greater than 4.4 mev , while the telescope placed on the right side consisted of @xmath23 [ 100 @xmath24 m ssd ] and @xmath26 [ si(li ) with 1.5 mm@xmath25 , 250 mm from the target ] detectors to identify and separate protons of energy greater than 3.2 mev from deuteron and triton particles . for the energy calibration of silicon detectors",
    "a standard technique was used for the ssd .",
    "the solid angles of left and right telescopes were 1.30 and 1.44 msr , respectively , with an angle resolution of about 1@xmath27 .",
    "we recorded the signals coming from the two telescopes within a window of about 100 ns by using a standard electronic set - up , choosing windows on the corresponding bit - pattern and the relevant time - to - amplitude spectra .",
    "we checked that the background of the p-@xmath1 coincidence events were completely absent when only the titanium backing was used .",
    "starting from the @xmath3he+@xmath2h collision in the entrance channel , the p+@xmath1+n+n four - body products in the exit channel can be produced via :    @xmath28    where processes ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) , and ( [ eq3 ] ) are the mechanisms in which unbound resonance states of @xmath0he@xmath7 , @xmath2h@xmath7 , and @xmath0li@xmath7 are formed at the first step of a two - body reaction , respectively , and then the @xmath0he@xmath7 excited states ( or , analogously , the @xmath2h@xmath7 or @xmath0li@xmath7 excited states ) decay at the second step of the reaction into the corresponding @xmath1+n+n ( or into p+n+n or p+@xmath1+n , respectively ) three - body channel . in process ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "the p charged - particle is the spectator , while in process ( [ eq2 ] ) the spectator role is played by the @xmath1 particle . in addition , as is well known and also reported in@xcite , in bidimensional coincidence spectra ( like our observed ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) spectra ) of a kinematically incomplete experiment leading to a four - body reaction , it is possible to observe in ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) bidimensional spectra a correlation between the @xmath8 and @xmath9 values of registered coincidence events only when the spectator particle comes from the first step of a two - body reaction mechanism and one particle of the subsequent three - body decay is detected ( see for example processes ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) ) . in the case of process ( [ eq3 ] ) , since we do not detect neutrons in our experiment , one neutron is the spectator at the first step of the two - body reaction while at the second step another neutron is produced , in the decay of the @xmath0li@xmath7 excited state into a three - body p+@xmath1+n formation . therefore , p-@xmath1 coincidence events due to process ( [ eq3 ] ) can not give any appreciable correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath9 values because this process causes a statistical relative energy distribution .",
    "for example , in the case presented in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , where the @xmath29 and @xmath1 detector telescopes are placed at @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and by considering that the @xmath4 beam energy is 27.2 mev , the highest @xmath0li@xmath7 excited state is at @xmath32  mev and the kinetic energy of the formed @xmath0li@xmath7 nucleus is 6.9 mev . the @xmath33 energy in the laboratory system of protons emitted at decay of @xmath0li@xmath7 ( @xmath34  5.366 mev ) into @xmath1+p+n does not exceed 3.7 mev ( see arrow at @xmath35  mev in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) .    consequently , the contribution of p-@xmath1 coincidence events due to process ( [ eq3 ] ) can affect the events produced by process ( [ eq1 ] ) in the @xmath36  mev @xmath37 energy region only .",
    "but , such a possible effect would not influence the results of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 measurements of @xmath0he@xmath7 , as will be explained in sec .",
    "processes ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) are , in general , both three - body formation at the first step of the reaction consisting of unbound resonance states @xmath38 and @xmath39 , with n+n and p+n pairs of particles , respectively . in the second step of the reaction the @xmath38 and @xmath39 excited nuclei decay into the p+@xmath1 and n+@xmath1 two - body channels , respectively . therefore ,",
    "in the above - mentioned cases , processes ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) do not produce any appreciable correlation between the @xmath8 and @xmath9 values of the coincidence event yields due to the statistical relative energy distribution of the remaining two neutrons in the four - body reaction of process ( [ eq4 ] ) , and proton and neutron particles in the case of process ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "in fact , in both of these processes , the two particles at the first step of the reaction ( the two neutrons , or the proton + neutron ) do not have the role of a single spectator .",
    "moreover , since the energy of protons in process ( [ eq3 ] ) does not exceed 3.7 mev , a fortiori protons produced in process ( [ eq4 ] ) can not exceed such energy value because they come from a three - body reaction at first step .",
    "in addition , in the case of process ( [ eq6 ] ) , if the detected proton energy produced at the first step of the three - body reaction overcomes 3.7 mev the @xmath1 particle coming from the @xmath39 decay can not reach a kinetic energy higher than the 4.4  mev necessary to be detected by the @xmath1 telescope , because the energy is carried out by the neutron produced in the first step of the process .",
    "therefore , also this process does not affect the ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) coincidence events . finally , the process ( [ eq8 ] ) is the direct statistical four - body break - up and it produces a flat low background contribution corresponding to a total value of coincidence events lower than about 10% of the complete set of registered ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) coincidences analyzed in each spectrum obtained as a projection of the p-@xmath1 coincidence yields onto the @xmath8 energy axis .",
    "the yield of each process depends on the kinematic conditions of reacting nuclei and the geometric configuration of detectors because the phase - space factor is determined by these conditions . to calculate the phase - space factor we use the procedure presented in the paper@xcite . with respect to the study of furic and foster@xcite ,",
    "the yields of the p-@xmath1 coincidence events , obtained by analysis of each ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) bidimensional spectrum , were projected onto the @xmath8-axis in order to have information about the formed @xmath40 resonance states .",
    "in fact , in the case of the p-@xmath1 coincidence event detection , if p is the spectator particle ( the residual nonresonant particle ) and @xmath1 is the particle constituting the @xmath40 three - body resonance , the observation of the population of such a resonant state can be made by projecting the yields of the ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) bidimensional spectrum on the @xmath8-axis .",
    "in such a case , the energy of the nonresonant particle for a given angle is completely determined by that angle and the excitation energy of the three - particle subsystem .",
    "therefore , a @xmath0he@xmath7 three - body resonance formation appears as a strip parallel to the @xmath9 energy axis .",
    "the projection of the p-@xmath1 coincidence event yields onto the @xmath8-axis produces an energy spectrum that gives information about the formed @xmath40 excited states decaying into the @xmath1+n+n three - body channel by process ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the projection of the coincidence event yields onto the @xmath9-axis produces a spectrum that can give information about the formed @xmath41 excited states decaying into the p+n+n three - body channel by process ( [ eq2 ] ) , but in our studied ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) bidimensional spectra the contribution of this process can not be present .",
    "in fact , in all of the investigated spectra obtained by the various @xmath42 , @xmath43 geometric configurations of telescopes , the very wide @xmath44  mev energy interval of the spectator @xmath1-particle of process ( [ eq2 ] ) corresponds to @xmath45 relative energies not higher than the 3 mev of the @xmath2h@xmath7 excitation energy . therefore",
    ", since the experimental threshold energy is 8.482 mev ( as reported in@xcite ) for the p+n+n three - cluster formation in the decay of @xmath2h@xmath7 excited state , in our investigated bidimensional spectra no contribution of events due to process ( [ eq2 ] ) can be present .",
    "moreover , the statistical direct four - body breakup contribution is considered as a flat low background contribution in our analyzed spectra .",
    "the motion of the two outgoing neutrons can be represented as the motion of their center - of - mass and the relative motion of these two neutrons .",
    "the events that correspond to relative energy of two emitted neutrons equal to zero can be considered as events of a p+@xmath1+@xmath46 three - body reaction where @xmath46 represents the dineutron cluster formed by two neutrons which move with the same velocity and direction , and the kinematic loci of p-@xmath1 coincidence events connected with the @xmath40 and @xmath41 formations are placed along the solid white lines ( upper or lower branches ) reported in the ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) bidimensional spectrum ( see fig [ f1 ] ) . by increasing the relative energy of the two neutrons , the events are distributed through the allowed kinematic area of the ( @xmath8 , @xmath9)-plane for the four - body reaction , inside the region delimited by the contour of the three - body reaction loci .    on the basis of the previous kinematic analysis related to the processes ( 2)(6 ) , we can affirm that in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] the experimental p-@xmath1 coincidence events , represented by red dots , mainly consists of process ( [ eq1 ] ) where the proton is the spectator and the @xmath1 is the charged particle coming from the decay of the @xmath0he@xmath7 excited states into the @xmath1+n+n three - body cluster .",
    "the arrow at @xmath47  mev in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] indicates the lower limit of proton energy detection by the telescope placed on the right side .",
    "light grey dots represent the result of a simulation connected with the upper branch of kinematic loci for the p+@xmath482n@xmath49 reaction products when the finite resolution of the detector system and beam energy are considered .",
    "blue dots represent the simulation of process ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "therefore , at the conclusion of the above - mentioned description of the processes ( [ eq1])([eq8 ] ) , only process ( [ eq1 ] ) of the @xmath3he@xmath50h four - body reaction can in principle produce enhancements in the analyzed spectra obtained as a projection of the p-@xmath1 coincidence yield vs. @xmath8 in connection with the formation of the @xmath40 and @xmath51 excited states , respectively .",
    "in the present experiment , by considering that the thickness of 100 @xmath52 m of the @xmath23-detector devoted to the detection of protons does not allow us to measure protons with energy lower than 3.2  mev , we may study the @xmath5 excitation energy spectrum of @xmath0he from the 1.45 to 3.65  mev energy range in connection with the @xmath22 telescope placed at @xmath30 , and from the 1.1 to 3.1  mev energy range for the detector placed at @xmath53 . in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , it is evident the cut of experimental events at @xmath54  mev , while the allowed region populating the p-@xmath1 coincidence of the four - body reaction lies within the kinematic loci of the @xmath2h(@xmath3he , p@xmath1)@xmath46 three - body reaction when the two neutrons are considered as one particle ( dineutron ) .",
    "resonances in two - body and three - body subsystems cause an increase in the intensity of break - up events in those places where the corresponding energy of the relative motion of decayed particles achieves resonance energies . in our",
    "obtained experimental data we did not observe any resonance phenomenon caused by the p-@xmath1 interaction ( formation of @xmath55li@xmath7 by process ( [ eq4 ] ) ) , while in all registered ( @xmath8 ,  @xmath9 ) bidimensional spectra one can observe the strips parallel to the @xmath56-axis consisting of events from process ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "these strips have been identified as a manifestation of the first @xmath0he@xmath7 excited state at @xmath14  mev and its subsequent decay into the three @xmath1+n+n components for which the threshold energy is 0.974 mev .",
    "we assume that besides the narrow first known excited @xmath0he level , broader resonance structures at lower proton energies may populate the ( @xmath8 ,  @xmath9 ) bidimensional spectra .",
    "if we project all p-@xmath1 coincidence events of the @xmath2h(@xmath3he , p@xmath1)2n four - body reaction onto the @xmath8 axis , connected with the proton detector placed at @xmath42 and @xmath1 detector placed at @xmath43 , we obtain the individual experimental spectrum of the p-@xmath1 coincidence events @xmath57 versus @xmath8 , related to the two - particle coincidence phase - space ( tpcps ) :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the projection onto the @xmath8 axis of the phase - space ratio for the detection of two coincidence particles ( proton and @xmath1-particle ) from the @xmath2h(@xmath3he , p@xmath1)2n four - body reaction .",
    "we calculated the energy dependence of the projection of phase - space @xmath60 for a fixed proton detection angle and various @xmath43 angles of the alpha - detector following the papers @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ f2ab ] ) .",
    "[ f2ab ]    figure 3 ( a ) and",
    "( b ) show that the shapes of the @xmath61 distributions are similar when @xmath42 is fixed and @xmath43 ranges through a set of values , even if the peak energy of each phase - space distribution changes slightly for the lines represented in figures ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "such a behavior allows one to add several individual experimental energy spectra obtained for a fixed @xmath42 angle and various @xmath43 angles in one cumulated spectrum , in order to check if in such a cumulated spectrum the energy distribution of events @xmath62 keeps the same feature of the individual spectra with respect to the observed low - lying @xmath0he@xmath7 excited states .",
    "of course , the final result of the @xmath5 peak energy and @xmath6 energy width determinations of the investigated @xmath0he@xmath7 resonances can be slightly affected by the procedure of cumulated spectra .",
    "for this reason we want to check if two close peaks in individual spectra are still well resolved in the cumulative spectrum .",
    "if this occurs , such a result confirms that the two close peaks observed in the individual spectra do not arise from fluctuations of data .",
    "in fact , also in the presence of coincidence events coming from @xmath1 particles emitted within an angular range of about 6@xmath27 , the results found for the two close @xmath0he@xmath7 excited states by analysis of individual spectra are confirmed by the results found in the cumulative spectrum obtained for coincidence events registered at the same @xmath42 angle of spectator proton but at various @xmath63 angles of @xmath1 particle emitted in the decay of @xmath0he@xmath7 in process ( [ eq1 ] ) .    in the calculation",
    "we take into account the beam energy and its dispersion , the target thickness , the energy loss in the target and the energy resolution of the detectors .",
    "figure [ f3ab ] shows the individual energy spectrum @xmath64 vs. @xmath8 of the p-@xmath1 coincidence events projected onto the @xmath8 axis , obtained for telescopes placed at @xmath30 , and @xmath65 ( see fig .",

    "[ f3ab ] ( b ) ) . in each figure",
    "three peaks clearly appear and we can fit the data with the sum of the following breit - wigner contributions    @xmath66    where @xmath60 is the phase - space factor calculated with the monte carlo simulation of the p and @xmath1 detected particles from the @xmath2h(@xmath3he , p@xmath1)2n four - body reaction , @xmath67 is the yield of the corresponding contribution of each @xmath0he@xmath7 resonance state decaying into @xmath1+n+n particles , and @xmath68 is the ( @xmath1 - 2n ) relative energy value at decay of @xmath0he@xmath7 excited state into @xmath692n products .",
    "this relative energy is uniquely determined by the @xmath42 angle and @xmath8 proton energy in the case in where the proton is the nonresonant particle leaving the @xmath0he@xmath7 excited nucleus at the first step of the reaction , while the @xmath1-particle is the resonant particle obtained at decay of @xmath0he@xmath7 into the @xmath1+n+n particles .",

    "for this reason , by investigation of our analyzed bidimensional coincidence spectra of a kinematicaly incomplete ( four - body ) reaction , we find for the narrow first excited @xmath0he@xmath7 state a @xmath6 width of at least 0.2 mev , but the energy resolution of our experimental apparatus allows us to resolve the two close @xmath0he@xmath7 excited states at about @xmath72 and @xmath73  mev , with @xmath74 and @xmath75 mev , respectively .",
    "therefore , the measure of the well known @xmath0he@xmath7 excited state at 1.8 mev is a test of the reliability of our analysis .",

    "[ f3ab ] and [ f4 ] , the possible contribution of process ( [ eq3 ] ) in the @xmath8 energy region from 3.2 to 3.7 mev does not affect the results of @xmath5 and @xmath6 obtained for the studied @xmath0he@xmath7 levels , because such events lie in the tail of the n(@xmath8 ) distribution .    in fig .",
    "[ f5ab ] we present the cumulative energy spectrum obtained as a sum of the three individual energy spectra collected at @xmath78 , respectively , when the proton detector is placed at @xmath30 .    as one can see , the @xmath5 and @xmath6 values reported in table [ tb2 ] for the cumulative energy spectrum are consistent with the respective values presented in table [ tb1 ] for the individual energy spectra , but only the @xmath6 width values are slightly larger due to the summing of spectra . even if we subtract in the spectrum of fig .",

    "for this reason , we can affirm that the best way to extract the @xmath5 energy peak and @xmath6 energy width of low - lying @xmath0he@xmath7 excited states is to analyze the individual ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) coincidence energy spectra ( also much better than analyzing the cumulative spectra ) at @xmath42 and @xmath43 detector angles where the phase - space factor of the reaction process forming the @xmath0he@xmath7 nucleus in the excited energy range of interest is large .",

    "in addition to the individual and cumulative p-@xmath1 coincidence spectra , we also show the inclusive proton energy spectrum of the @xmath2h(@xmath3he , p)@xmath1nn reaction where the detected protons can come from channels ( 1 ) and ( 3)-(6 ) , as explained in sec .",
    "2 . figure [ inclusive ] shows the inclusive proton spectrum at @xmath80 .",
    "as one can see , such an experimental @xmath57(@xmath8 ) spectrum clearly exhibits peaks of the @xmath0he formation corresponding to : the ground state ( g.s . ) with proton kinetic energy of about @xmath8= 10.6 mev , the first excited state with about @xmath8= 7.7 mev , a broad distribution peaked at about @xmath8= 5.5 mev , and an appreciable shoulder at about @xmath8= 6.6 mev . to these values of proton kinetic energy",
    "correspond on the upper @xmath81 excitation energy axis the values of about 0 ( g.s . ) , 1.75 ( the known 2@xmath10 first excited state ) , 2.9 , and 2.4 mev , respectively . by analyzing this inclusive energy spectrum contributed by",
    "all considered allowed channels , it is impossible to resolve close excited states of the @xmath0he@xmath7 formation and extract reliable @xmath5 and @xmath6 values .",
    "from a simple look of fig . [ inclusive ] , the @xmath5 values of @xmath0he@xmath7 levels are consistent with the ones obtained in our analyzed p-@xmath1 coincidence energy spectra ( see figs .",
    "[ f3ab ] and [ f4 ] ) .",
    "but , due to a large uncertainty in the background contribution by processes ( [ eq1 ] ) , and ( [ eq3])([eq8 ] ) , it is not suitable to extract from inclusive spectra reliable @xmath6 width values of the @xmath0he@xmath7 levels .",
    "we performed the @xmath3he+@xmath2h experiment at @xmath82  mev by using a target with a titanium backing saturated with tritium , with the aim of investigating the low - lying @xmath0he@xmath7 levels populating the energy region just above the threshold energy of the @xmath1+n+n three - cluster formation . by the analysis of the ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) energy spectra of the registered p-@xmath1 coincidence events we find two new well resolved @xmath0he@xmath7 excited states decaying into the @xmath1 + 2n three - cluster channel . from the obtained values for the @xmath5 and the @xmath6 energy width presented in table [ tb1 ] for various angle configurations of detectors , we suggest the following averaged values : @xmath83  mev with @xmath84  mev , and @xmath85  mev with @xmath86  mev for the two new @xmath0he@xmath7 resonance states , respectively",
    "it is useful to compare the results obtained in the present paper by analyzing the ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) bidimensional spectra of the studied @xmath2h(@xmath3he , p@xmath1)2n experiment for the excited levels of the @xmath0he@xmath7 formation in the @xmath5 energy region from 1.45 to 3.65 mev with the results found by mougeot _",

    "we extract the @xmath5 and @xmath6 values of the first excited state and two new 2.4 and 2.9 mev levels of @xmath0he@xmath7 with @xmath870.3 and 0.4 mev , respectively .",
    "instead , the authors @xcite in their fit of experimental data used the @xmath5 and @xmath6 values given in literature@xcite for the first @xmath0he@xmath7 excited state , and they found only one @xmath0he@xmath7 resonant state at @xmath342.6 mev with @xmath871.6 mev , by analyzing the triton - particle spectra with @xmath88 angle intervals of at least @xmath89 ( or even more ) . we think that for the nature of the investigated reaction and the sensitivity of analysis the authors @xcite observed a wider convolution of the two @xmath0he excited states than we found .",
    "the appropriate experiment at lower @xmath3he beam energy and detailed analysis of the individual ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) energy spectra which we considered are necessary in order to find and well resolve the two close 2.4 and 2.9 mev @xmath0he@xmath7 excited states .",
    "the reliability of spectral analysis and the results found in the present experiment for the considered four - body reaction is confirmed by the values of @xmath90  mev with @xmath84  mev obtained for the first @xmath0he@xmath7 excited state which are consistent with the values given in literature @xcite within the experimental resolution .",
    "in addition , we also find consistent @xmath0he@xmath7 level energies by looking the inclusive proton energy spectrum that confirms the presence of the two new low - lying @xmath0he@xmath7 excited states decaying into the @xmath1 + 2n channel , but we note that it is not suitable to measure the @xmath5 and @xmath6 spectroscopic parameters by the inclusive proton spectra . moreover , the two new and close low - lying levels found for the @xmath0he@xmath7 resonance states decaying into the @xmath1+n+n three - cluster channel will be useful as a test for the choice of the nucleon - nucleon potential in the theoretical model .",
