    "supernovae ( sne ) are classified into two main categories according to whether there are hydrogen lines present in their spectrum , usually taken near peak brightness : hydrogen - deficient supernovae are designated as type i ( sne i ) , while those with hydrogen are type ii ( sne ii ) . the category of sne i is again subdivided into sne ia , ib , or ic , depending on whether they show further spectral features .",
    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are identified by the appearance of a strong absorption feature at about 6150    due to blueshifted @xmath66355 ( for reviews see , e.g. , filippenko 1997 ; harkness & wheeler 1990 ) .",
    "a striking feature of sne ia has been their homogeneity ; they have only moderate scatter in observed absolute peak magnitudes ( hamuy et  al .",
    "1996a ) and similar light - curve shapes and spectra ( e.g. , leibundgut & pinto 1992 ; branch & tamman 1992 ; filippenko 1997 ; branch 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , the observed variations in luminosity among sne ia are found to be correlated with their light - curve shape , hence furnishing a tool to accurately calibrate the peak luminosity of sne ia ( e.g. , the @xmath1(@xmath0 )  method  phillips 1993 ; hamuy et  al .",

    ", psf fitting has the advantage of creating an image in which the measured objects can be subtracted .",
    "this can serve as an indicator of the quality of the brightness measurements of the comparison stars and the supernova .",
    "before the photometry procedure itself was initiated , special care was taken to remove cosmic rays , especially those around the psf stars . since our particular ccd camera",
    "is cooled thermoelectrically rather than with liquid nitrogen ( for mechanical simplicity , and to decrease human maintenance of the robotic telescope ) , the temperature of the camera is not very stable and dark current is not always cleanly removed from the images .",
    "the resulting low - level dark - current residual varies during the night and has to be removed manually by adding or subtracting a few percent of the long - exposure dark - current image .",
    "the uncertainties introduced by the manual scaling of the dark current have only negligible effects on the brightness measurement of the high - contrast sn and the psf stars .    the psf for each image was determined with daophot using well - isolated stars in the field , which are neither too bright ( saturated ) nor too faint .",

    "the employed method , which has also been used by riess et  al .",

    "uncertainties were estimated by combining in quadrature the errors given by the error analysis package in daophot with those introduced by the transformation of instrumental magnitudes onto the standard system and by the @xmath73 correction . since sn  1998de was a relatively faint and red supernova , bad weather conditions influenced our data and affected the @xmath0 images the most .",
    "for the sets of nights of august 11/12/13 , august 16/17/18 , and september 19/20/21 , the @xmath0 images had to be combined to yield one single image for each set in order to obtain a sufficiently high s / n ratio . the data for september 19/20/21 , the last three nights of observation , were combined in this manner for all filters , since the sn was already very faint at that point . for the combined images ,",

    "one of the most unusual characteristics displayed by the intermediate and late - time spectra of sn  1991bg is a very strong and relatively narrow absorption line measured near 5700   , which increases in strength over time .",

    "these results are very interesting : whereas sn  1991bg showed a lower expansion velocity than normal sne ia , which led to the theoretical insights that the mass of the ejecta might be small for consistency with an early onset of the nebular phase and that complete burning was confined to the innermost regions ( t96 ; m97 ) , sn  1998de might not show such a clear trend .",
    "again , early - time spectra would have been more useful for monitoring the development of the expansion velocity .",

    "the spectrum of sn  1998de may show a small indentation at the expected position of , but the quality of the data is too poor for a definite conclusion .",
    "m97  claim that the observed behavior of the @xmath67774 absorption in sn  1991bg , which does not evolve redward ( i.e. , to lower velocities ) during the first two weeks after @xmath14 maximum , is indicative of an outer oxygen shell containing unburned material from the progenitor , for which the observed [ ] @xmath65577 emission was the first clue .",
    "the absence of the @xmath67774 absorption line in sn  1998de could be due to possible contamination by a blend of broad emission lines , but no likely candidates are known .",
    "a more feasible explanation could be that there is not as much [ ] present in sn  1998de as in sn  1991bg .",
    "if so , perhaps sn  1998de does not have as much unburned oxygen left as did sn  1991bg .    as in other sn ia spectra , the obvious p - cygni profile of the near - infrared triplet is visible between 8000    and 8700   , although both absorption and emission are much stronger than usual , similar to the appearance of sn  1991bg .",
    "early - time spectra would be more conclusive for displaying the effects of color evolution  indeed , we would expect those spectra to be redder than in normal sne ia .",
    "the consistently red color of sn  1991bg was interpreted by m97  as an indication for a lower photospheric temperature , as would be expected with the presence of only incomplete nuclear burning .",
    "figure 9 displays the spectra of sne  1998de , 1991bg , and 1994d at about the same epoch of @xmath85 7 weeks , while figure 10 shows the spectra of the same sne at @xmath85 12 weeks .",
    "our initial conclusion  that differences between sn  1998de and sn  1991bg increase with increasing wavelength  is confirmed . besides the further emergence of emission lines ,",
    "the following major changes have occurred in sn  1998de , and are clearly visible in figure 10 : ( 1 ) the [ ] @xmath65577 and the @xmath67774 emission features have weakened and become broader ; ( 2 ) pronounced emission has appeared at 5900    whose position coincides with the [ ] emission in sn  1991bg ( l93 ; t96 ; m97 ) ; ( 3 ) a deep and broad absorption trough is present at @xmath106800    adjacent to an emerging broad emission feature at @xmath107200   ; and ( 4 ) @xmath66355 has disappeared whereas @xmath65968 seems to have gained strength and may be contaminated in its blue wing .",
    "most of the emission lines at this nebular stage are identified with forbidden lines of fe and co , the decay products of @xmath152ni , while the emission is still strong in the spectra of both sn  1998de and sn  1991bg ( figure 10 ) .",
    "the oxygen line deterioration can be explained by the fact that the photosphere is receding into the central parts of the ejecta , where the higher - mass elements have been produced .",
    "the drifting of emission lines to the red , most notably the [ ] feature at 4615  , illustrates the decrease in the expansion velocity as we look deeper into the ejecta . the broad absorption at 6800    is most probably due to , whose signature is visible in sn  1991bg as well as in sn  1994d ( and generally in sne ia ) .",
    "the adjacent emission at 7200   , which is only visible at @xmath153 days , could be tentatively identified as a blend of [ ] @xmath6@xmath67291 , 7324 ( f92 ; ruiz - lapuente et  al .",
    "1993 ) or a blend of [ ] ( l93 ) .",
    "note that the corresponding feature in sn  1991bg is observed at a slightly longer wavelength ( 7250   ) and that it dominates the spectrum of sn  1991bg , whereas it is very broad and not as distinct in the spectrum of sn  1998de ( also the red shoulder seems to be contaminated ) , and is absent in the case of sn  1994d .",
    "since the @xmath65968 absorption is not contaminated by a  d line , it is easily visible as a distinct feature at nearly the same position as in the @xmath70 = 31 d spectrum , only deeper . because this feature deepens between the two last epochs and is accompanied by a receding photosphere which reveals the deeper layers , we could have evidence that nuclear burning was incomplete in these layers .",
    "the dominant and narrow [ ] emission feature of sn  1991bg visible at 5908   has been regarded by m97  as an indication of a centrally peaked distribution of @xmath152ni and as the result of complete incineration of matter in the central part of the ejecta , assuming that the emissivity is proportional to the co abundance and to the local gamma - ray deposition rate in the co - rich material . combining this with their observation of oxygen during the photospheric phase ,",
    "m97  suggest that complete burning did not take place everywhere , and that the outer layers underwent incomplete burning in contrast to the inner part . for sn  1998de ,",
    "the corresponding [ ] emission is observed at nearly the same position of around 5900    in both the @xmath154 51 d and the @xmath154 76 d spectra ; however , it is not as narrow as in sn  1991bg",
    ". this might indicate that complete incineration extended to a larger radius in sn  1998de than it did in the case of sn  1991bg .",
    "[ ] @xmath6@xmath66129 , 6197 emission is also found at around 6210    in the @xmath154 76 d spectrum , matching the features at 6144    and 6204    in sn  1991bg ( t96 ) .",
    "furthermore , we see the afore - mentioned emission of [ ] ( l93 ; see t96  for alternative identification ) at around 6520    in the spectrum of sn  1998de , a feature which is found in all three sne ( 1994d , 1991bg , 1998de ) and which was already visible in their intermediate - phase spectra ( see figure 8) .",
    "the trough between 4100    and 4500   , a primary characteristic of sn1991bg - type objects , is still distinctly visible at these late times .",
    "thus , this feature can be used as a powerful tool for distinguishing between peculiar and normal sne ia at all epochs , even for sne at large redshifts ( whose restframe visible and red spectral regions are shifted into the range where the infrared fringing of ccds affects the data ) .",
    "the strong presence of can be explained either in terms of abundance anomalies or by excitation differences .",
    "both f92  and m97  favor the interpretation that the red color and hence low excitation temperature is largely responsible for producing the observed strong lines in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( see , e.g. , fig . 1 of branch 1987 ) and , simultaneously , the higher - excitation lines of the other ions like .",
    "in sne ia , the energy of the initial explosion gained through thermonuclear fusion is used up by the adiabatic expansion of the ejecta ( e.g. , leibundgut &  pinto 1992 ) , whereas the light curve is powered by the decay of radioactive @xmath152ni and @xmath152co .",
    "it is also believed that there is a direct link between the mass of the @xmath152ni  produced during the explosion and the peak bolometric luminosity ( see , e.g. , arnett , branch , &  wheeler 1985 ; hflich et  al .",
    "the observed low @xmath155 luminosity of sn  1998de is indicative of its bolometric luminosity for the following reasons : the peak of the energy distribution of sn  1998de lies in the optical part of the spectrum , thus we can be confident that the low observed optical luminosity translates into a similarly low bolometric luminosity . furthermore , there is no plausible way to have a large uv excess , nor is there evidence for a large amount of dust , which could have reprocessed the optical photons of sn  1998de to provide a significant infrared excess .    therefore , we can conclude that the mass of the synthesized nickel was smaller in sn  1998de than in normal sne ia .",
    "derive a value of @xmath100.07 m@xmath156  of synthesized @xmath152ni for sn  1991bg , which agrees well with the original estimate of ruiz - lapuente et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) of 0.05 to 0.1 m@xmath156  and which is a factor of 4 to 8 smaller than in normal sne ia .",
    "we could expect that similar amounts of nickel have been produced in both sn  1991bg and sn  1998de , as both sne exhibit similar absolute magnitudes in all filters . however , spectral synthesis calculations and bolometric light curves are necessary for obtaining a definitive value for the nickel mass .    on the other hand , there are a number of indications that suggest that sn  1998de might have experienced a slightly more powerful explosion than sn  1991bg did . among these are the marginally slower decline of the light curves in the @xmath14 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 bands and the offset of the color curves toward the blue .",
    "the fact that sn  1998de appears to show the same luminosities when compared with sn  1991bg ( on the same distance scale ) is only mildly inconsistent with the other pieces of evidence .",
    "the models which have been proposed to explain the physics of sne ia in the last 30 years can be divided into two main categories : those that describe different explosion mechanisms with the same progenitor system , and those that propose different systems as the reason for the heterogeneity of sne ia and in particular as production sites of subluminous sne ia . despite the partial success of various models ( see reviews by , e.g. , woosley &  weaver 1986 ; wheeler & harkness 1990 ; branch et  al .  1995",
    "; livio 2000 ; hillebrandt & niemeyer 2000 ) , no general consensus about the exact character of the explosion mechanism and the evolutionary track that leads to the sn ia event has yet been reached .",
    "hflich , khokhlov , & wheeler ( 1995 ) used the pulsating class of delayed detonation models to establish the principle that chandrasekhar mass c - o white dwarfs give a common explosion mechanism accounting for both normal @xmath157 subluminous sne ia , with sn  1991bg as their example for the latter group .",
    "however , as t96  correctly point out , their model requires a large reddening for sn  1991bg [ @xmath158 mag ] in order to harmonize the theoretical luminosity with the observed value , while observations indicate a much smaller value close to zero ( f92 ; l93 ; t96 ) . also , the decline rates of their sn  1991bg models are similar to those of their normal sn ia models , while sn  1991bg is observed to be much faster .",
    "as mentioned by f92  and others , an alternative scenario for subluminous sne ia might involve ejecta with mass appreciably @xmath159 than the chandrasekhar limit that would account for several of the peculiar features of sn  1998de .",
    "the trapping of gamma rays produced by the decay of @xmath152ni and @xmath152co would be less effective due to the low column depth of the ejecta , thus leading to the rapid decline in the observed @xmath11 light curves after maximum light and possibly to the low optical luminosity .",
    "also , low - mass ejecta expanding at only a slightly slower velocity than in normal sne ia would allow the photosphere to recede more quickly than usual , revealing the deeper layers and giving rise to the early emergence of the nebular spectrum .",
    "the decline in photospheric expansion velocity from @xmath1013,000@xmath72  at @xmath147 days ( garnavich et  al .",
    "1998 ) to 7080@xmath72  at @xmath160 31 days might be consistent with that of sn  1991bg , which showed an expansion velocity of @xmath107000@xmath72  at @xmath137 27 days .",
    "unfortunately , there are no other data points available for sn  1998de , especially since photospheric velocities are not defined during the nebular phase ( i.e. , for our last two spectra ) , and no premaximum spectra are available for sn  1991bg .",
    "the consistently small velocity observed in sn  1991bg was interpreted by t96  as a possible indication that complete nuclear burning was confined to the innermost regions .",
    "other phenomena which are thought to support this conclusion are the high abundance of oxygen ( suggested by the [ ] @xmath65577 and @xmath67774 lines ) left over from the progenitor ( t96 ; m97 ) , and the narrow [ ] emission at 5908  .",
    "using the presence and strength of those features as observed in sn  1998de , we might infer that the inner region of complete burning was somewhat larger in sn  1998de than in sn  1991bg ; indicators include the weaker appearance of @xmath67774 and the somewhat broader [ ] emission at 5900    in sn  1998de .",
    "furthermore , the hypothesis that sn  1998de might have experienced a slightly more powerful explosion than sn  1991bg did is consistent with this model .",
    "the red color of both sne 1998de and 1991bg seems to implicate a low excitation temperature which gives rise to the trough found at the blue end of the spectrum without requiring an overabundance of titanium .    here",
    ", we briefly review some of the scenarios proposed to explain the ejection of a sub - chandrasekhar envelope .",
    "livne ( 1990 ) , woosley & weaver ( 1994 ) , and hflich & khokhlov ( 1996 ) suggest that the @xmath161 itself has a mass below the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "according to their models , a sub - chandrasekhar - mass c - o white dwarf detonates due to the ignition of an outer he shell accumulated on top of it .",
    "their predictions include a lower luminosity , a lower production rate of nickel , and an overabundance of titanium .",
    "in addition , the observed light curves can be adequately reproduced with this model .",
    "the absence of unburned he in the spectra might be explained by the low excitation temperatures present . on the other hand , they predict bluer colors at maximum brightness , while sne 1991bg and 1998de are very red at that phase , as well as an outer ni shell , which has not been observed in any of the subluminous sne ia .",
    "moreover , they do not account for the outer oxygen shell .",
    "another possibility might be a double - degenerate system of intermediate - mass c - o white dwarfs that merge , giving rise to the disruption of the less massive star , followed by the formation of a thick , hot accretion disk around the more massive companion and the subsequent explosion of the remaining white dwarf when it reaches the chandrasekhar limit ( e.g. , iben & tutukov 1984 ; webbink 1984 ) .",
    "as a consequence only a small mass of @xmath152ni would be produced , and there would be a mixture of burned and unburned material as observed in sn  1991bg and sn  1998de .",
    "however , the outcome of such a coalescence is still not completely understood ; there are strong indications that it may rather lead to accretion - induced collapse forming a neutron star than to a sn event ( see , e.g. , saio & nomoto 1985 , 1998 ; woosley & weaver 1986 ; mochkovitch & livio 1990 ; mochkovitch , guerrero , & segretain 1997 ) .    unfortunately , none of the proposed models unambiguously emerges as the preferred candidate for explaining subluminous sne ia , since each of the models appears beset by some problems as discussed above .",
    "detailed studies of more subluminous sne are needed to provide additional constraints for the models .",
    "indeed , the ongoing efforts of loss to conduct photometric follow - up observations of recently discovered subluminous sne ia promise to contribute significantly ; the results will be discussed by li et  al .",
    "( 2001c ) .",
    "we have presented a set of photometric and spectroscopic observations of the recent sn  1998de , which reveal it to be an intrinsically faint sn ia , similar to , but not identical with sn  1991bg .",
    "similarities include ( 1 ) the intrinsically low luminosity ; ( 2 ) the remarkably red colors near maximum ; ( 3 ) the narrow peak in all bands ; ( 4 ) the rapid and monotonic decline of the light curves , including in the @xmath4 band ; ( 5 ) the strong absorption lines throughout all observed epochs ; ( 6 ) the early transition to a nebular spectrum ; and ( 7 ) the strong [ ] emission lines at late times .",
    "the very good coverage and high quality of the @xmath11 light curves make sn  1998de a defining template for subluminous sne ia , superior to the conventional template sn  1991bg , and clearly establish sn  1998de as a fast riser .    whereas the @xmath0 passband provides the best early - time match between sn  1991bg and sn  1998de",
    ", the deviations in both light curves and spectra between the two sne ia seem to increase toward longer ( redder ) wavelengths .",
    "features of sn  1998de that distinguish it from sn  1991bg include ( 1 ) a plateau phase ( or a possible second maximum ) in the @xmath4 band , very shortly after the first maximum ; ( 2 ) a slower decline of the light curves in the @xmath14 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 bands ; ( 3 ) slightly bluer colors at intermediate phases ; ( 4 ) the absence of the conspicuous  d absorption found at 5700    in the spectra of sn  1991bg ; and ( 5 ) the evolution of a region ( 6800@xmath57600   ) in the spectra of sn  1998de from featureless to feature - rich .",
    "our comparison of sn  1998de and sn  1991bg may imply that subluminous sne ia are not fully described as a one - parameter [ @xmath1(@xmath0 ) ] family .",
    "the somewhat slower decline rates and bluer colors , combined with the evidence that the region of complete burning was larger in sn  1998de than in sn  1991bg , suggest that sn  1998de might have experienced a slightly more powerful explosion than sn  1991bg did .",
    "the observed peculiarities of sn  1998de ( and of sn  1991bg ) might be explained in terms of ejecta with a mass smaller than that found in normal sne ia .",
    "however , at this time chandrasekhar - mass models seem to provide an equally acceptable explanation .",
    "our analysis strengthens the conclusion that sn  1991bg was not a unique event , as already proposed by studies of several other intrinsically dim sne ia .",
    "further conclusions to be drawn  besides the insights into the intrinsic workings of sne ia  concern the implications of our observations for the calibrated - candle assumption of sne ia and for their usage as cosmological distance indicators .",
    "we propose that intrinsically subluminous sne ia should be identified in samples of sne ia used for cosmological purposes , with the trough at the blue end of the spectrum and the absence of a clear secondary maximum in the restframe @xmath4 band as possible criteria .",

    "<S> we present spectroscopic and extensive photometric observations of supernova ( sn ) 1998de in the s0 galaxy ngc 252 , discovered during the course of the lick observatory supernova search . these data , which span a time period of 8 days before to 76 days after @xmath0-band maximum , unambiguously establish sn  1998de as a peculiar and subluminous type ia supernova ( sn ia ) with strong similarities to sn  1991bg , the prototype of these intrinsically dim sne ia . </S>",
    "<S> we find that sn  1998de , which has @xmath1(@xmath0)=1.95@xmath20.09 mag , rises and declines much faster than normal sne ia and does not exhibit the usual plateau in the @xmath3 band . in the @xmath4 band </S>",
    "<S> it shows a short plateau phase or possibly a secondary maximum , soon after the first maximum . </S>",
    "<S> we find that subluminous sne ia with the same value of @xmath1(@xmath0 ) can have slightly different light curves at longer wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the notable spectroscopic similarities between sn  1998de and sn  1991bg are the wide trough at 4100@xmath54500   , the strong features , and the early onset of the nebular phase . we observe that spectroscopic deviations of sn  1998de from sn  1991bg increase toward redder wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> these deviations include the absence of the conspicuous  d absorption found in sn  1991bg at 5700   , and the evolution of a region ( 6800@xmath57600   ) from featureless to feature - rich . </S>",
    "<S> several lines of evidence suggest that sn  1998de was a slightly more powerful explosion than sn  1991bg . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of our observations for progenitor models and the explosion mechanism of peculiar , subluminous sne ia . </S>",
    "<S> the extensive photometric data make sn  1998de a better template than sn  1991bg for calibrating the low - luminosity end of the luminosity vs. decline - rate relationship . </S>"
