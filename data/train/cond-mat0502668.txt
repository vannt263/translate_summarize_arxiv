    "recent work @xcite reports on extensive simulations of a simple model for the dna denaturation transition , i.  e. the thermal unbinding of the two strands of the dna helix . in this model",
    "the two strands are represented by self avoiding walks of length @xmath7 on a ( hypercubic ) lattice .",
    "the walks also are mutually avoiding , but with some essential qualification .",
    "they start from the same origin and they are allowed to occupy the same lattice point , provided the distances of this point from the origin , as measured along the two strands , coincide .",
    "such an overlap of ` complementary base units ' is weighted by a factor @xmath8 , where @xmath9 represents a binding energy which in dna is due to hydrogen bridges .",
    "clearly this model is only a rough caricature of a real dna molecule . in particular",
    "it ignores the helical structure of the doubly - stranded parts as well as the chemical heterogeneity of dna , which yields a base - pair dependent binding energy .",
    "however , the model fully includes the large scale properties of the embedding of the chain molecule into real space , which are governed by the excluded volume .",
    "the results of the simulations support the common view that there exists a sharp unbinding transition which in the limit of infinitely long strands , @xmath10 becomes a true phase transition .",
    "furthermore it is suggested @xcite that this transition is of first order , with a jump in the density of bound base pairs , which is the order parameter of the transition .",
    "for some other observables , nontrivial power law scaling has been found @xcite .    on the theoretical side",
    "the standard model for the dna denaturation transition has been proposed by poland and scheraga long ago @xcite .",
    "it concentrates on the internal configuration of dna , treated as a linear sequence of doubly stranded parts and singly stranded loops and easily allows for the incorporation of the sequence heterogeneity of real dna molecules .",
    "the poland scheraga ( p.s.-)model has become the standard tool for analyzing denaturation experiments @xcite .",
    "such experiments give direct access to the order parameter of the transition mentioned above .",
    "the data typically are analyzed in terms of ` melting curves ' , defined as the derivative with respect to temperature of the average number of bound pairs .",
    "these curves may show some pronounced sequence - dependent structure , which can well be reproduced by the p.s .- model .",
    "however , the model is essentially one - dimensional .",
    "it involves only the ` chemical distance ' along the chain .",
    "the embedding into three - dimensional real space shows up only in some entropic weight assigned to the loops . a loop consisting of two strands of length @xmath11",
    "is weighted by a factor @xmath12 where the ` cooperativity parameter ' @xmath13 governs the density of loops along the dna , and the exponent @xmath5 is calculated from the probability that two long walks , @xmath14 starting from the same point meet again after @xmath11 steps .",
    "the numerical value of the loop exponent @xmath5 turns out to govern the asymptotic @xmath15 nature of the denaturation transition . with @xmath16",
    "we for small @xmath13 in the melting curves may see some strong peak , but no proper phase transition exists .",
    "for @xmath17 there is a second order transition , and for @xmath18 the transition is of first order . originally the loops were taken as closed random walks @xcite , which yields @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the dimension of the embedding space .",
    "it immediately was pointed out @xcite that self - avoidance within the loops changes the loop exponent to @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the correlation length exponent of the self - avoiding walk problem .",
    "it takes values @xmath23 or @xmath24 respectively .",
    "more recently kafri et .",
    "@xcite invoked the theory of polymer networks to argue that the excluded volume interaction between the self - avoiding loop and the other parts of the dna molecule increases @xmath5 above 2 both in two and three dimensions .",
    "for @xmath25 a value @xmath26 was suggested .",
    "furthermore , the scenario suggests that open strands of length @xmath27 @xmath28 at the ends of the denaturating dna should be weighted by a factor @xmath29 with @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "further extensions of this approach have been presented @xcite , which will be addressed below .",

    "model one always takes @xmath32 implying that no nontrivial end effects exist .",
    "the loop exponent typically is choosen as @xmath33 close to @xmath21 @xmath34 .",
    "the success of the analysis , though most remarkable ,  can not be taken as experimental support of this choice , since the melting curves are not sufficient to unambiguously fix the large number of parameters involved in applying the model to a real dna molecule @xcite .",
    "it recently has been shown @xcite that melting curves for a given base sequence calculated within the p.s .- model both with @xmath35 or @xmath36 can be brought on top of each other by adjusting the cooperativity parameter @xmath13 . for",
    "@xmath37 @xmath13 has to be increased by a factor of order 10 compared to its value for @xmath35 .",
    "since independent information on @xmath13 is missing , the experiments leave the value of @xmath5 and thus the asymptotic character of the transition undetermined .",
    "this situation asks for a closer examination of the results of the simulations described above .",
    "clearly , if the p.s .- model accurately captures the physics of dna denaturation , then it has to reproduce quantitatively the results of the simple lattice model , where the complicated chemical microstructure associated with many fit parameters is absent .",
    "the present work therefore tries to answer three related questions .",
    "+ @xmath0 is a model of p.s .- type able to consistently fit all the relevant simulation results ? + @xmath1 does the analysis fix the exponents @xmath4 @xmath38 ? + @xmath39 if the data are compatible with a range of exponents , what other observables able to fix the exponents are in reach of present day computer experiments ?",
    "the first question is not trivially answered . in view of the experimental situation described above",
    "we clearly expect the theory to provide a good fit to the simulated melting curves , but the computer experiments provide much more detailed information . in particular , the distribution functions of both the number of bound pairs and the length of the loops have been measured .",
    "it is thus not self - evident that we find a positive answer to question @xmath40 if we include some nontrivial weighting of the open ends the thus generalized p.s .-",
    "model reproduces all the published data curves remarkably well .",
    "we stress that we here refer to the whole functions , not just to asymptotic power laws .",
    "we will find that the chain length in the simulations by far is too small to reach asymptotic power law scaling .",
    "the answer to question @xmath1 is somewhat ambiguous .",
    "the analysis clearly shows the need of an end - weighting exponent @xmath41 but all observables related to the distributions of the number of bound pairs or the length of the open ends reasonably well can be fitted with loop exponents in the range @xmath42 .",
    "it is only the measured loop length distribution which in the region of smaller @xmath11 clearly favors a value @xmath18 . since , however , the loop weight @xmath43 by construction is meant to hold for @xmath44 fixing a precise value of @xmath5 is somewhat a matter of taste .",
    "insisting on fitting the data down to @xmath45 a value of @xmath46 can be extracted .",
    "however , assuming that corrections to the asymptotic loop weight die out only for @xmath47 ( we will give some arguments supporting this view ) , we can fit the data with @xmath5 in the range @xmath48 .    in view of these results , consideration of question @xmath39",
    "is of interest .",
    "the trivial answer that longer chains must be simulated seems to be unrealistic . changing the boundary conditions should be a more realistic option . in the available simulations",
    "the two strands are bound together at one end , whereas the other end of the ` dna chain ' may be , and in general will be , open . comparing to results for chains bound together of both ends may considerably restrict the allowed range of values of @xmath5 .    with the restricted chain lengths of the simulations , ( ref .",

    ", the normal finite size scaling limit is not sufficient .",
    "this limit consists in taking @xmath7 to infinity , with other variables , properly scaled by powers of @xmath7 , held fixed so as to magnify the critical region . in our analysis",
    "we need to keep the leading correction terms to this limit , which for @xmath51 vanish as @xmath52 .",
    "since in any case @xmath53 is small , for the chain lengths considered these corrections are not negligible . indeed , they explain the deviations of the effective exponents previously extracted from the data @xcite from the exponents @xmath4 @xmath38 introduced in the model .",

    "all the parameter sets used here essentially yield the same results for these quantities and thus for @xmath457 this suggests that for each parameter set we could find a short - range part @xmath452 of @xmath458 so that the data for @xmath317}_{bu}$ ] are fitted consistently together with all other quantities .",
    "an example is shown in the insert of fig .",
    "11 and will be discussed below . in view of the above",
    ", the problem of fixing a range of @xmath5 from data for @xmath317}_{bu}$ ] amounts to identifying a value @xmath459 such that @xmath460 for @xmath461 for estimating @xmath459 the literature offers two somewhat contradictory pieces of evidence .",
    "@xcite presents results of exact enumeration on the square lattice , for chain lengths @xmath462 the data seem to obey the scaling law @xmath317}_{bu } \\left(\\ell , n\\right ) = \\ell^{-c}$ ] @xmath463 with @xmath464 the network scenario predicts @xmath465 in two dimensions .",
    "these results suggest @xmath466 and accepting the same value in three dimensions we would conclude that @xmath5 is very close to @xmath384 the network scenario predicts @xmath37 an estimate based on simulations of star polymers @xcite with arm lengths up to @xmath467 however , previous work @xcite covering only arm lengths @xmath468 resulted in somewhat different effective exponents , which yield a value @xmath469 thus , in an optimistic view we might take the good fit with @xmath46 as supporting the network scenario",
    ". this value could be interpreted as an effective exponent describing loop lengths of order @xmath470 consistent with the above mentioned results the effective exponent is smaller than the asymptotic value @xmath471 clearly this interpretation implies that @xmath452 is a sizeable correction up to at least @xmath472 this is quite plausible , since the corrections to asymptotic scaling in the excluded volume problem in three dimensions are known to decrease roughly like @xmath473 the insert in fig .",
    "11 demonstrates that such corrections easily can bring the theoretical curves to match the data also for @xmath474 ( in two dimensions the corrections are expected to decrease like @xmath120 , which might explain the observation of ref .  @xcite quoted above . )",
    "however , irrespective of the validity of any specific choice of @xmath5 these considerations imply that @xmath85 can not be expected to be negligible for @xmath475 whatever the true value of the exponent @xmath5 might be , we must expect that embedding of the chain into three - dimensional space gives rise to corrections typical of the excluded volume problem . in a less optimistic view",
    "we thus would conclude that @xmath5 might take any value in about the range @xmath476 these values resulting from the assumption that @xmath459 is of the order of 100 .",
    "even though the choice @xmath36 based on the network scenario allows for a consistent interpretation of the data , we from the analysis of the data have no reliable arguments to exclude other values of @xmath129",
    "according to our analysis the present data are compatible with exponents @xmath5 in at least the fairly large range @xmath6 for a more precise determination the obvious approach would be to simulate longer chains .",
    "for instance , with chains of length @xmath477 the predicted height of the maximum of the melting curve increases by about @xmath478 in going from @xmath479 to @xmath480 however , it seems unlikely that for such long chains sufficiently precise simulations can be carried through in the near future .",
    "we thus should look for other observables sensitive to @xmath129    two features of the transition prevent a precise determination of @xmath129 firstly , the smallness of @xmath53 forces us to include the corrections to finite size scaling with the associated fit parameter @xmath481 only the simulation of much longer chains could eliminate these terms , which blur the qualitative difference among @xmath482 or @xmath483 secondly , with the @xmath68-boundary conditions used the chain essentially opens from the end , irrespective of @xmath129 for instance , for @xmath281 on average about half of the chain is open for all @xmath5 in the above range , irrespective of @xmath303 clearly , this feature suppresses the sensitivity to @xmath5 of the transition . to eliminate this effect we should switch to @xmath67-boundary conditions , where both chain ends are closed .    fig .",
    "12 shows the density of bound pairs and the melting curves predicted with @xmath67-boundary conditions for @xmath339 @xmath484 or @xmath485 respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath486 are taken from the fit to the @xmath68-data .",
    "we note that the transition is shifted towards negative values of @xmath487 as expected .",
    "what is more important , even for such short chains we see a clear effect of changing @xmath129 for @xmath106 the effect just increases with @xmath303 for @xmath488 the peak height for @xmath451 decreases faster than for @xmath453 near @xmath489 there is a region where the peak heights approximately coincide and where an experimental discrimination among the two predictions will be more difficult .    in fig .",
    "13 we compare predictions for the mean length of the first loop .",
    "panel @xmath490 shows results for @xmath68-boundary conditions .",
    "for @xmath491 the effect of changing @xmath5 is quite small , but it increases rapidly with @xmath303 data for @xmath366 could improve the estimate of @xmath5 considerably . as panel @xmath364 shows , for @xmath67-boundary conditions the effect again is increased , to the level where data for @xmath491 could be as useful as data for @xmath366 and @xmath68-boundary conditions .",
    "these findings suggest that a more precise determination of the exponent @xmath5 would be possible by comparing the results for @xmath492- or @xmath67-boundary conditions .",
    "such simulations could be carried through for fairly short chains , since a clear effect is predicted even for @xmath432",
    "we have found that a model of the type proposed by poland and scheraga is able to quantitatively reproduce simulation data of a very simple model of the dna denaturation transition .",
    "it , however , turned out to be essential to amend the original p.s .- model by a factor @xmath493 weighting the unbound ends of the doubly stranded chain .",
    "the simple ansatz @xmath494 is sufficient , but without such a factor the model can not reproduce the chain length dependence of the data . concerning the application of the p.s .- model to the analysis of physical melting curves , this may be the most important result found here .    concerning the simulation data we have found that an interpretation within the framework of the p.s .- model implies that chain lengths @xmath495 are far too short for asymptotic finite size scaling to hold .",
    "we must include corrections to this limit which decay only as @xmath496 since the numerical value of @xmath53 is quite small , this implies that all the effective exponents extracted by straight forward data analysis are strongly influenced by the correction terms .",
    "in particular this holds for the exponents which motivated the co - polymer network scenario . for",
    "the dangling ends this scenario introduces a weight @xmath493 involving two different exponents .",
    "our analysis lends no support to this hypothesis .    allowing for unbinding of an end of the doubly stranded chain we have found that denaturation is dominated by the prolongation of the dangling ends .",
    "the internal loop structure of the closed part of the chain does not change much during the transition . as pointed out in sect .",
    "[ kap3 ] , for @xmath18 this is true irrespective of @xmath497 but for the chain lengths considered here it holds true also for @xmath498 we , for instance , note that for @xmath499 @xmath361 the mean length of a loop according to the theory increases only from @xmath500 to @xmath501 in a range where the average length of the open ends increases from @xmath502 to @xmath503 this observation is of immediate consequences , if we try to determine the exponents @xmath328 from the data . @xmath2 which governs the weight of the dangling ends , can be determined with fair precision .",
    "we found @xmath435 the loop exponent @xmath5 , however , at best is bounded by @xmath6 an even larger range results if we allow for more pronounced short range effects in the ansatz for the loop weight @xmath504 in full agreement with previous work @xcite we find that changes of @xmath5 essentially are compensated by changing the cooperativity parameter @xmath505    excluding simulation of much longer chains we see two possibilities to decrease the uncertainty of @xmath129 we found that the mean length @xmath506 of the first loop is sensitive to @xmath4 even if we allow the chain end to unbind .",
    "for @xmath507 the effect should be measurable reasonably well .",
    "another , and possibly more efficient , approach would be to simulate chains bound together at both ends .",
    "this eliminates the pathway dominating denaturation for unbound ends .",
    "the theory predicts measurable effects of changing @xmath5 even for @xmath508 furthermore such boundary conditions have the additional virtue of suppressing the factor @xmath493 , which is not well known quantitatively .    in summary ,",
    "the results of the present work suggest that the poland - scheraga model generalized by an end - weighting factor catches the essential physics of the denaturation transition .",
    "since the network scenario predicts such a factor we feel that the analysis also supports this scenario with its associated exponents @xmath509 however , more work must be done to put this latter conclusion on a firmer basis .",
