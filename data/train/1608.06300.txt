    "over the last decade it has become clear that planetary systems are very common around stars of mass comparable to or less than the sun .",
    "observations using both the radial velocity method and the transit method demonstrate that the frequency of planetary systems is substantial ( howard et al .",
    "2010 , 2012 ; mayor et al . 2011 ; borucki et al . 2011 ; youdin 2011 ; batalha et al .",
    "2012 ; dressing & charbonneau 2013 ; christiansen et al . 2015 ; petigura , howard & marcy 2013 ) .",
    "furthermore , it appears that the demographics are dominated by low mass ( sub - jovian ) planets with semi - major axes @xmath3au .",
    "indeed , a large fraction of planetary systems appear to be more compact than our own , often with multiple planets having orbital periods shorter than mercury .",
    "this has led to an ongoing discussion about the origins of these planets . the original migration paradigm ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ; lin & papaloizou 1986 ; ward 1997 ) , adapted to explain the presence of giant planets on small scales ( lin , bodenheimer & richardson 1996 ) , initially predicted few small planets with periods less than a year ( ida & lin 2008 ) and resonant chain configurations for those that did exist ( ida & lin 2010 ) .",
    "the observational contradiction of these predictions has spawned alternative models , although the migration paradigm retains a healthy population of proponents ( rein 2012 ; mordasini et al . 2012 ; cossou et al .",
    "the late stage assembly of planets in situ ( hansen & murray 2012 , 2013 ; chiang & laughlin 2013 ) can broadly reproduce the observed distribution of planets on small scales , although the mass inventory is still large enough to imply some level of mass redistribution during the nebula stage , whether it be during the small particle stage ( boley , morris & ford 2014 ; chatterjee & tan 2014 ; hansen 2014 ) or as planetary embryos ( chatterjee & ford 2015 , ogihara , morbidelli & guillot 2015 ; boley , granados contreras & gladman 2016 )",
    ".    radial velocity surveys also point to the existence of a substantial population of giant planets at larger ( @xmath4 ) scales , starting with the third exoplanet system announced ( butler & marcy 1996 ) .",
    "it is therefore of interest to understand how giant planets on large scales affect the configuration of smaller , more compact , planetary systems .",
    "while it is quite possible that these subsystems affect each other in complicated ways during formation , the simple fact of their mutual existence today implies a minimum level of interactions due to secular oscillations in eccentricity and inclination stemming from the long - range gravitational interactions between the components .",
    "the characteristic timescales are dictated by the induced precession which scales @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the semi - major axis and mass of the perturbing planet ( e.g. adams & laughlin 2006 ; hansen & murray 2015 ; lai & pu 2016 ) .",
    "this scaling implies that a jupiter mass planet at 2  au induces oscillations on the same timescale as a planet with mass @xmath8 with semi - major axis @xmath9au .",
    "thus , there is potential for significant near - resonant gravitational interaction between planetary systems on large and small scales .",
    "indeed , this is believed to happen in the solar system , with such interactions believed to be responsible for sculpting features of the asteroid belt ( williams & faulkner 1981 ; minton & malhotra 2011 ) , delivering bodies onto earth - crossing orbits ( froeschle & scholl 1986 ; morbidelli et al . 1994 ) , and contributing to the potential instability of mercury s orbit ( laskar 1997 ; laskar & gastineau 2009 ; batygin & laughlin 2009 ; lithwick & wu 2011 ) .",
    "thus , a natural question emerges  given the unexpected nature of the recent planetary discoveries , what is the potential for dynamical interactions between the compact , low - mass planetary systems discovered by transit searches and the larger mass , more distant systems probed by radial velocity surveys ?",
    "our first goal in this paper is to examine the likely strength of these interactions and to identify the mass and separation ranges that allow for interaction .",
    "in fact , there are already potential signatures of such interactions present in the observations of extrasolar planets today , most notably in the apparent excess of planetary systems showing a single transiting planet ( see   [ kste ] ) . thus",
    ", a second goal of this paper is to identify possible observational signatures of secular interactions between close and distant planets , and to offer predictions as to how such hypotheses may be confirmed .",
    "the organisation of this paper is as follows .",
    "we will describe the observational evidence for the existence of external perturbations in   [ kste ] . in",
    "  [ incpert ] we examine the effects of perturbing the inclinations of model planetary systems with a single distant giant planet on an inclined , circular orbit .",
    "alternatively , one may perturb the system with a distant giant planet on an eccentric , coplanar orbit , and we investigate this effect in   [ eccpert ] . in ",
    "[ multipert ] we will describe how a pair of distant giant planets can increase the strength of perturbations by coupling the modes of the interior and exterior systems . in ",
    "[ twopop ] we will examine how the results of the different experiments described in   [ incpert]  [ multipert ] can be combined to provide a range of observable properties .",
    "we also consider , in   [ longview ] , the possible further evolution of these model planetary systems , due both to the possibility of long - term chaotic diffusion and the effects of tidal damping . in   [ datcomp ] we consider possible secondary observables relevant to these results and compare the results to these in   [ disc ] before summarising our conclusions in ",
    "the most extensive observational database for model comparison on this question is the kepler planet candidate sample ( borucki et al .",
    "2011 ; batalha et al . 2013 ; burke et al .",
    "2014 ; rowe et al . 2015 ; mullally et al .",
    "2015 ; coughlin et al .",
    "2015 ) , which has yielded several thousand confirmed and candidate planets .",
    "a successful theory for planet formation must thus match the observed properties of this sample , include the distribution of planetary radii , orbital periods and orbital spacings .",
    "hansen & murray ( 2013 )  hereafter hm13 ",
    "demonstrate that the in situ assembly can match these observations , but one property of the observed sample was not reproduced , namely the ratio of systems with one transitting planet ( henceforth termed ` tranet ' , as proposed by tremaine & dong 2012 ) to those with more than one tranet in the system .",
    "this finding echoed previous analyses .",
    "lissauer et al .",
    "( 2011a ) found that the observed ratios of systems of different transit multiplicity could be matched with a single underlying system of 34 planets and an inclination dispersion of a few degrees , as long as one excluded single tranet systems .",
    "this latter class appeared overabundant by as much as 2/3 , relative to that predicted by the best fit models for the higher multiplicities .",
    "other analyses that attempted to model the underlying population in the face of selection effects ( fang & margot 2012 ; tremaine & dong 2012 ) could similarly only match the population if they allowed for either a subset with large dispersion in inclination or with a reduced multiplicity .",
    "ballard & johnson ( 2016 ) subsequently found that a similar excess of single transit systems is found around low mass host stars as well , possibly even in greater numbers .",
    "overall the excess of single tranets appears to be a robust signature of the dynamical history of the observed exoplanet population .",
    "several authors ( fang & margot 2013 ; pu & wu 2015 ; volk & gladman 2015 ) suggest that the highly multiple kepler systems are packed close to the dynamically stable limit , and hypothesize that the lower multiplicity systems are the product of those initial systems that underwent diminution as the result of dynamical instability .",
    "however , johansen et al . ( 2012 ) and becker & adams ( 2016 ) cast doubt on whether such systems , on their own , are capable of sufficient dynamical self - excitation to actually produce a sufficient excess of single tranets .",
    "one obvious route forward is to consider the effect of perturbations by giant planets on scales @xmath10au .",
    "we know that giant planets exist on scales @xmath10au around some fraction of stars , and so the it is natural to consider that the combination of these and compact planetary systems must exist with a non - negligible frequency and may lead to dynamical interaction .",
    "two broad classes of excitation may serve to dynamically heat our model systems  if the external perturber(s ) excites primarily planetary inclinations without increasing eccentricities , it may leave the underlying mass distribution and multiplicity undisturbed , while reducing the frequency with which tranets are observed .",
    "alternatively , excitation of eccentricity will eventually lead to the crossing of planetary orbits and result in dynamical instability , reducing the multiplicity of the planetary system directly .",
    "can one explain the observations with one or both of these models , or do they require unrealistically strong interactions ?",
    "indeed , are they even distinct scenarios , since excitation of inclination to too large an amplitude will also inevitably excite eccentricities ?    in order to understand the nature of the problem ,",
    "let us first re - examine the comparison of the hm13 models with the data .",
    "we consider the kepler candidate sample contained in the nasa exoplanet database as of july  5 , 2016 .",
    "we consider two versions of the catalogue .",
    "the latest release is dr24 , reflecting the analysis of coughlin et al .",
    "this has the advantage of being the first to be uniformly selected algorithmically .",
    "unfortunately , christiansen et al . (",
    "2016 ) identify some systematic errors in this catalogue at longer periods , which will be of interest to us later .",
    "thus , we adopt , as our primary source catalogue , the ` cumulative ' catalogue from the archive , although we will quote dr24 results as well , in order to assess the robustness of our conclusions . we also restrict ourselves to candidate hosts with 4000  k@xmath117000  k , @xmath12 and kepler magnitude@xmath13 , to focus on fgk stars with sufficient signal - to - noise .",
    "we also restrict our comparisons to those tranets with orbital periods between 4 and 260  days .",
    "the lower period limit is to enable a faithful comparison to the original assembly models of hm13 ( which started with an inner edge to the planetesimal disk of 0.05  au ) and the upper period limit to match the restriction we place in subsequent sections based on the dynamical stability limit with jovian mass perturbers at 1  au .",
    "figure  [ fig : pdis_bin ] shows the period distribution of tranets with @xmath14 for those in single tranet systems and those in multi - tranet systems . also shown , as histograms , are the equivalent samples of model tranets based on observing the simulated systems from hm13 from randomly oriented lines of sight .",
    "these artificial observations make use of the detection efficiency based on the artificial injection analysis of christiansen et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , and discussed in more detail in ",
    "[ numexi ] .",
    ", as a function of orbital period , for candidates in the kepler database orbiting sun - like stars ( selected as described in the text ) .",
    "the upper panel shows counts for stars which show only a single tranet , while the lower panel shows counts for stars with multiple tranets .",
    "the solid histogram indicates the distribution of model planets in our default , unperturbed set of simulations , observed from random inclinations .",
    "the distribution of cases in which only a single tranet is observed is thus compared to the sample in the upper panel , and those with multiple tranets are shown in the lower panel .",
    "the same scaling has been applied to the model in both panels , and has been chosen to best match the distribution of multiples in the lower panel .",
    "[ fig : pdis_bin ] ]    we see that the observed tranets in single and multiple systems have similar period distributions , but that the model distribution does not . in the model ,",
    "the single tranets are more strongly peaked at short orbital periods , reflecting the fact that the models show an increase in the inclination dispersion inside 0.1  au that is amplified by the increased transit probability at small separations .",
    "we can also sum the total number of tranets and tranet systems in the upper and lower panels and compare them . in the case of the observations ,",
    "the ratio of single tranet systems to multi - tranet systems is @xmath15 , whereas the models of hm13 predict 1.8 .",
    "similarly , if we take the ratio of single tranets to all the tranets found in multiple systems , the observations yield @xmath16 and the models predict 0.71 .",
    "the shortfall in these numbers represents the kepler single tranet excess , or kste .",
    "we note that , if we restrict ourselves to single tranets with period @xmath17  days , we reduce the observed count by a factor 0.32 , bringing them below the model values . thus , the excess of single tranets and the difference in the period ratio distribution in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : pdis_bin ] are closely related issues .",
    "thus , the question is whether giant planet perturbations can change the properties of the model systems to better match the observations . in particular , we need to generate more single tranets on scales @xmath1850  days , as compared to @xmath19  days , than are found in the observed systems . as a figure of merit for comparison ,",
    "we define @xmath20 to be the ratio of the number of single tranets in the period range 1050 days to the number observed between 410  days . for the sample defined here , this is @xmath21 , while the unperturbed simulations yield @xmath22 .",
    "if we calculate the equivalent quantity for the tranets in multiple systems , the observations yield @xmath23 and the simulations @xmath24 .",
    "these demonstrate that there is little difference in the observations , but a substantial difference in the simulations",
    ".    a subsidiary goal of the following analysis is thus to understand what perturbations yield trends that go in this direction  increasing the number of single tranets on scales @xmath2510  days .",
    "a system of earth - class planets on sub - au scales , with the spacings of observed systems , will interact to produce secular oscillations of eccentricity and inclination on timescales of @xmath26@xmath27 years .",
    "these modal interactions manifest themselves as precession of the planetary orbits .",
    "a giant planet on larger scales will also exert an effect , inducing lagrangian precession and oscillations in eccentricity and inclination . to quadratic order ,",
    "the evolution of eccentricity and inclination are independent , and so let us consider each in turn . in particular",
    ", we wish to understand if perturbations in inclination alone can substantially change the transit probability , or does it require such large perturbations that dynamical instability inevitably follows ?      to orient our discussion , let us first consider a simple model system of two planets , each of mass @xmath28 , and separated by a factor of 2 in semi - major axis .",
    "we consider this in essence a sub - unit of a multiple planet system that incorporates the conflict between mutual and external perturbations .",
    "we add to this the influence of a circular orbit giant planet on larger scales , and we ignore the backreaction of the interior planets on the outer body .",
    "this model problem has a variety of applications to planetary systems ( see boue & fabrycky 2014 or lai & pu 2016 for recent treatments ) . for our illustrative purposes , we are satisfied to describe the behaviour of the planetary inclinations in the classical limit of low eccentricities and inclinations . to this end",
    "we define the delauney variables @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the planetary inclinations and @xmath31 are the longitudes of the ascending nodes .",
    "the secular evolution equations for the inner pair are thus ( e.g. murray & dermott 1999 )    @xmath32    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and the @xmath35 are the laplace coefficients .",
    "we assume that @xmath36 and @xmath37 are constants , which adds an extra term over the usual expression .",
    "this can easily be converted to the standard form if we transform to a set of new variables , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "this represents the system in terms of the relative orientations of the two inner planets ( index=1 ) and the outer two planets ( index=2 ) .",
    "our evolution equations are then @xmath42 this system can now be solved in the traditional manner to yield two eigenvalues and eigenvectors . in the limit where the influence of the external perturber goes to zero ,",
    "this system can be reduced to @xmath43 leading to a simple sinusoidal oscillation for @xmath44 .",
    "this is an illustration of the well known fact ( e.g. murray & dermott 1999 ) that the classical two planet secular problem in inclination yields only a single non - zero eigenvalue because only the relative inclinations matter .",
    "the external perturber provides a reference plane which then restores the second non - zero eigenvalue .",
    "thus , the behaviour is naturally represented as a combination of a mode in which the two interior planets oscillate relative to each other and then a mode in which they oscillate relative to the external perturber .    to illustrate the resulting behaviour",
    ", we place our inner pair at 0.1  au and 0.2  au , and place a @xmath45 perturber at 5  au .",
    "we give the inner pair initial values of @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the outer perturber is placed on an orbit with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this is a little larger than what one might naively expect to be relevant from a classical calculation , but highlights the intrinsic behaviour of the model .",
    "figure  [ fig : ex1 ] shows the resulting secular oscillations .",
    "this figure also shows the same system evolved with the direct n - body code _ mercury _ ( chambers 1999 ) , demonstrating that the behaviour is faithfully reproduced , even with the @xmath52 tilt of the outer planet .    ) while the lower panels show the evolution of the nodal alignment of the two inner planets ( specifically , the cosine of the difference in their longitudes of ascending nodes ) .",
    "[ fig : ex1 ] ]    we see that the characteristic behaviour of this system is that the outer planet causes a coherent oscillation of the inclinations of the inner pair , with a small oscillation in their mutual inclinations .",
    "the figures only show @xmath53 but would look the same if @xmath54 were also plotted , as the amplitude of the difference mode is substantially smaller than the mode of their coherent oscillation .",
    "we also see that the systems remain nodally aligned for most of the time , with only a brief period of misalignment that occurs when the amplitude of the coherent mode oscillates to low values .",
    "the misalignment occurs when the oscillations of the relative mode become larger than the amplitude of the coherent mode .",
    "it is worth also noting that the presence of the constant terms in equations  ( [ sec0 ] ) means that the resulting temporal behaviour of the inclinations contains power not only at the beat frequency between the two modes ( as in the usual case ) but also at the two eigenfrequencies themselves .",
    "this can be seen in another example , shown in figure  [ fig : ex2 ] , where we repeat the same calculation as before , but bring the perturber in to @xmath55 and incline it by only @xmath56 .",
    "this makes the contributions of the two modes more equal , and yields a more complex behaviour , although it still retains the same general character .     as a solid line and @xmath54 as a dashed line ) when subjected to a perturber",
    "inclined by @xmath56 ( shown as a dashed line ) .",
    "the lower panel again shows the nodal alignment via @xmath57 .",
    "deviations of nodal alignment are associated with periods when one or both of the planetary inclinations drops substantially below that of the perturber [ fig : ex2 ] ]    the inference from this is that the presence of a single distant perturber does nt necessarily increase the _ dispersion _ in inclination amongst interior planets , but mostly just tilts the system coherently .",
    "this is has been noted before by several authors ( innanen et al .",
    "1977 ; kaib , raymond & duncan 2011 ; bou & fabrycky 2014 ; li et al . 2014",
    "; lai & pu 2016 ) .",
    "thus , a tilted external planet may not change the relative transit probabilities as much as expected .",
    "one question we then need to address is how close a distant perturber has to be to substantially affect the dispersion and hence the transit frequency .",
    "we can assess this by examining a larger range of systems .",
    "we retain the masses and semi - major axes of the inner pair , but allow for randomly chosen nodal longitudes , and choose inclinations from a rayleigh distribution with a dispersion of @xmath58 ( an estimate that fits both inferred distributions  fang & margot 2012  and assembly simulations  hm13 ) .",
    "we then calculate the resulting secular oscillations in the case of no perturber , and calculate the observability of the system from a large number of randomly chosen orientations in order to calculate the probability of observing a single tranet ( @xmath59 ) or two tranets ( @xmath60 ) for the system .",
    "the resulting distribution of @xmath61 is shown in figure  [ fig : tdis ] .",
    "there is a substantial variation depending on the degree of nodal alignment in a particular system , but the mean value of @xmath62 , with a dispersion of @xmath63 ( although the actual distribution is asymmetric and biased slightly to lower values ) .     for the case of no perturber , for randomly oriented pairs chosen as described in the text .",
    "the blue histogram shows the results if we perturb the system with a @xmath45 planet at 5  au , with an orbital plane tilted by @xmath56 relative to the inner pair .",
    "if we place the perturber at 1  au , we get the red histogram . [",
    "fig : tdis ] ]    if we apply perturbations from a @xmath45 planet at 5  au , with a @xmath56 inclination , we get the blue histogram shown in figure  [ fig : tdis ] , and a mean of @xmath64 , with a dispersion of 0.36 .",
    "thus , there is only a small change .",
    "if we move the jupiter to 1  au , with the same inclination , then we get the red distribution shown in figure  [ fig : tdis ] .",
    "this has a mean of @xmath65 and a dispersion of 0.21 .",
    "jupiter mass planets are observed at such distances and so will notably affect the transit probabilities .",
    "however , it is worth noting that these are still well in excess of those observed .",
    "figure  [ fig : ta ] shows how the double / single tranet ratio evolves as one moves the perturber inwards .",
    "indeed , there is little effect at distances @xmath66au and we only see a substantial effect for @xmath67au .     as a function of the perturber semi - major axis .",
    "the perturber is @xmath45 in all cases , tilted by @xmath56 relative to the reference plane .",
    "the error bars indicate the intrinsic dispersion that results from variations in the inclinations and nodal alignment of the inner pair , as shown in the text .",
    "the horizontal dotted line indicates the value obtained in the case of no perturber .",
    "[ fig : ta ] ]    of course , one expects a greater effect if one tilts the perturber more , although we have shown that the effect is limited .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig : tim ] shows the effect on @xmath61 as we increase the tilt @xmath68 of a @xmath45 planet at 1  au .",
    "we see that we can indeed get the mean ratio of @xmath61 under 0.2 as long as we impose tilts larger than @xmath69 .     as a function of the perturber inclination relative to the reference plane .",
    "the perturber is @xmath45 in all cases , located at 1 au .",
    "the error bars indicate the intrinsic dispersion that results from variations in the inclinations and nodal alignment of the inner pair , as shown in the text .",
    "the horizontal dotted line indicates the value obtained in the case of no perturber .",
    "the points in the lower panel show the mean value of @xmath61 as a function of the perturber mass , for a perturber located at 2  au and tilted by @xmath56 to the reference plane .",
    "the error bars indicate the intrinsic dispersion that results from variations in the inclinations and nodal alignment of the inner pair , as shown in the text . the horizontal dotted line indicates the value obtained in the case of no perturber .",
    "[ fig : tim ] ]    we can also make the effects stronger if we increase the mass of the perturber . higher mass may also mean a significant influence from more distant perturbers .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : tim ] shows the effect of increasing the mass @xmath70 of a perturber at 2  au , with an inclination of 5@xmath71 .",
    "we see that we need a perturber @xmath72 to start making a difference with these parameters , and still somewhat above the observational threshold even with @xmath73 .",
    "these calculations suggest that individual pairs must be perturbed quite strongly before they produce predominantly single tranet systems .",
    "however , real systems often contain more than two planets , with the resulting increase in the number of available secular modes .",
    "is it possible that an external perturber can couple more strongly to some modes than others , thereby increasing the inclination dispersion , at least between different collective modes ? indeed , although we have noted above that a single planet tends to tilt pairs of planets coherently more than it increases dispersion , hansen & murray ( 2015 ) ",
    "hm15  also noted that many of the simulated systems from hm13 broke down into two or more subsets of strongly coupled planets with relatively weak coupling between the subunits .",
    "if only one subunit is tilted relative to another , this might still have some bearing on the observations .",
    "however , too much tilting may also excite eccentricity and thereby incite dynamical instability . to answer these questions",
    "is beyond ( semi)-analytic means and requires that we perform numerical simulations .",
    "we can examine this by considering the model systems produced by hm13 .",
    "the in situ assembly integrations in that paper produced a set of model systems that matched most of the properties of the observed distribution , including distributions in orbital period , period spacing and relative frequency of multiple transet systems .",
    "the most glaring exception was that it did not produce the excess of single tranets seen in the observations and it is this issue that we wish to address here .",
    "thus , we adopt the hypothesis that the results of hm13 serve as a proxy for the underlying high multiplicity population and examine their sensitivity to a variety of perturbations , seeking to produce a result that increases the number of single tranets observed .",
    "these are the models used to make the comparison to the data in figure  [ fig : pdis_bin ] . to do this , we take 50 simulated systems and observe them at randomly chosen inclinations to quantify the frequency with which different multiplicities of tranet are observed .",
    "we convert the planetary masses into planetary radii using the mass - radius relation of seager et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , assuming perovskite equations of state , and increasing the radius by a factor of two relative to that .",
    "this is to account for the fact that many of the planets observed by kepler appear to have a non - negligible contribution to the radius from an envelope composed of a lower density material , possibly hydrogen ( e.g. lissauer et al .",
    "2013 ; weiss et al . 2013 ; wu & lithwick 2013 ) .",
    "a factor of two may be slightly optimistic in this regard , but our goal here is to examine the influence of perturbations in reducing the observed multiplicity and so we choose to err on the side of observability . since the goal of this study is not a detailed inversion of the kepler data , but rather a study of the sensitivity of the results to changes in the underlying population , we characterise the kepler detectability of our model planets by assuming high signal - to - noise detections and then using the results of an injection and recovery analysis by christiansen et al .",
    ", downloaded from the nasa  exoplanet  archive ( the details of which can be found in christiansen et al .",
    "2016 ) , to quantify the probability of detection as a function of orbital period and planetary radius .    after observing the original model systems in this fashion , the resulting frequency of double to single tranet systems is @xmath74 . the ratios for higher multiplicities are @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "as noted before , these latter values are consistent with the observations , but the first value is approximately a factor of two too high .",
    "this is the kste discussed earlier . in order to calculate a systematic error bar on these numbers ,",
    "we randomly select subsets of 25 of this overall set of 50 simulations and recalculate the tranet frequencies . with a thousand trials",
    ", we find that 68% of trials yield ratios in the ranges @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "thus , the inferred ratios are robust with respect to choice of simulated system .",
    "let us now consider the effect of tilting the system with an external perturber .",
    "we now take the outputs from the original simulations and extend the integrations for an additional @xmath82  years , but with a @xmath83 perturber at 1  au , on a circular orbit inclined by @xmath84 relative to the original orbital plane of the unperturbed system .",
    "we designate this numerical experiment a1 .",
    "these systems are once again integrated using the _ mercury6 _ integrator ( chambers 1999 ) with the addition of a relativistic precession term .",
    "the implementation and testing of this was discussed in hansen & zink ( 2015 ) , and we note again here that the short timesteps used in these integrations ( 12 hours ) avoid the problems sometimes encountered in implementing such effects .",
    "the original simulations of hm13 extended out to 1  au and so sometimes produced planets that would overlap with the giant planet . in order to avoid planet scattering that might introduce it s own effects , we removed all original planets with semi - major axis @xmath85  au from the initial conditions before beginning the new integrations .",
    "relative to the original orbital plane ( as indicated by the horizontal dashed line ) .",
    "the fifth most planet oscillates much more rapidly and was omitted for clarity .",

    "the third closest to the star ( 3 ) , is shown in cyan and the fourth ( 4 ) is shown in red .",

    "the inner three planets couple via two modes with substantially higher frequencies than the external precession induced at these locations , and so they are largely immune from the effects of the giant planet .",
    "the precession of the outermost of the five , on the other hand , is dominated by the perturber , and is no longer strongly coupled to the other four .",
    "the fourth planet in the system lies in between , coupled to the inner planets but also experiencing an external forcing of comparable size .",
    "the result is the behaviour shown in figure  [ fig : ibounce ] , in which the inclination of the inner three planets track each other relatively closely , while the inclination of the fourth planet ( red curve ) moves in and out of phase with the others . in this system , many multiple tranets are still seen , and @xmath86 , for the configuration at the end of the integration , when averaged over all viewing angles . of course",

    "the inner two oscillate more slowly but still experience substantial perturbations from the giant .",
    "the lower panel shows the same system but without the perturbations from the external jupiter .",
    "we see the overall amplitudes are smaller and that the third planet is much more in phase with the second .",
    "[ fig : ibounce2 ] ]    in the case of the three planet system shown in figure  [ fig : ibounce2 ] , the perturber has a stronger effect . in this case",
    ", there are only two modes in the absence of the external perturber . for the third ( most distant ) of the planets ,",
    "the resulting precession is small relative to that from the external perturber and",
    "so this one is once again driven by the giant planet .",
    "the other mode couples the two inner planets , and this has a frequency close to commensurate with the external forcing at the location of the second planet .",
    "the consequence of this is that the inclination oscillations are driven more strongly and the frequency of tranet multiplicity is reduced substantially . in the absence of a perturber",
    ", this system shows @xmath89 , but the presence of the perturber reduces this to @xmath90 . in part , this is due to the fact that the second and third planets are responsible for 2/3 of the double tranet observations in the unperturbed system , and their oscillations are much less correlated when the third planet is forced by the external perturber .",
    "this , then , is how the tranet multiplicity is reduced across the ensemble as a whole ",
    "some systems are largely unaffected , while others experience more substantial inflation of their inclination oscillations and thereby reduce the likelihood of observing a perturbation .",
    "the resulting frequencies of tranet multiplicity , when sampling the 50 systems as described before , are @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the value of @xmath61 is now consistent with what we got for simplified analysis of planet pairs in   [ lagoi ] and figure  [ fig : tim ] .",
    "the factor of two reduction relative to the unperturbed case also brings it below what is required to match the observations .",
    "this is encouraging , although it would imply that nearly all the kepler systems were subject to a substantial external perturbation ( we will return to this question in   [ datcomp ] ) .",
    "it also now underpredicts the frequency of higher multiplicity systems , suggesting that this can not be the entire solution .",
    "the inclinations observed here often reach @xmath95 , somewhat beyond the classical expectation .",
    "one can wonder whether this starts to pump eccentricities and lead to dynamical instability ?",
    "of the fifty systems integrated , 24 lost at least one planet , either by collision or ejection .",
    "so , some reduction in the number of planets is observed , although the level of dynamical instability is not sufficient to drastically alter the true planetary multiplicity ( 80% of surviving systems still contain between 36 planets interior to 1  au ) . however , the increased mutual inclinations do clearly have some effect on the tranet multiplicity  especially on the number of triple and quadruple systems .",
    "these enhanced inclinations may also lead to measureable obliquities of planetary orbital planes relative to the stellar spin . over",
    "the 50 systems observed , the median inclination for singles is @xmath96 and for multiples @xmath84 .",
    "this is to be compared to the inclination distribution of the undisturbed systems , which is well fit by a gaussian with dispersion of @xmath97 for multiples , and a function of the form @xmath98 for singles , where @xmath99 and the inclination dispersion is @xmath100 .",
    "so there is some tilting of the overall orbital planes , but probably not enough to be easily discernible in observations .",
    "not surprisingly , the median obliquities correspond to that of the perturber .    in terms of the period distribution of single planets , @xmath101 , so it is better than in the unperturbed case , but still somewhat short of the observed distribution . for the planets in multiple systems , @xmath102 . in principle",
    ", we could increase the inclination of the perturber to reduce @xmath61 even more , but then it would also reduce the higher multiplicity statistics . furthermore , this implies a substantial population of jovian perturbers , perhaps too many .",
    "can we achieve the same effects with smaller , distant perturbers ?",
    "let us now consider the possibility that our model systems are coupled to perturbers on larger scales that can still provide sufficient disturbance to reduce the multiplicities , but are small enough to evade detection via radial velocities .",
    "the current sample of radial velocity planets trace a curve with amplitude @xmath103 , which amounts to a mass @xmath2 at 1  au .",
    "thus , we repeat the above experiment with the same setup but now for a perturber of mass @xmath104 . we designate this as experiment  a2 .    as one might anticipate , a lower mass perturber with a @xmath84 inclination yields weaker perturbations .",
    "the multiplicity ratios are @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , which retains the same trend as the @xmath83 perturber , but with a larger ratio of @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the reduced perturber mass does reduce the effect and results in multiplicity ratios closer to the unperturbed model and farther from the observations . however , it is possible that a larger inclination can yield the same effect with a smaller mass .",
    "thus , we now repeat our numerical experiment , with mass @xmath104 but now inclined at @xmath52 and @xmath109 .",
    "these values might be considered extreme , but the last twenty years of exoplanet discovery suggest that perhaps our expectations are usually too conservative and that we might be better served by hamlet s famous dictum  there are more things in heaven and earth , horatio , than are dreamt of in your philosophy  ( shakespeare 1623 ) .",
    "thus , for experiment  a3 , we examine the effects of a @xmath104 perturber on a circular orbit at 1  au , but inclined by 30@xmath71 relative to the original plane of the interior systems .",
    "indeed , the increased perturbation yields @xmath110 , @xmath111 and no quadruple or quintuple tranet systems at all .",
    "the median obliquities are @xmath112 for singles and @xmath113 for planets in multi - tranet systems and @xmath114 for singles .",
    "this indicates that , although the tranet multiplicity has been substantially reduced , the excessive weighting towards short periods remains .",
    "on the other hand , these perturbations leave a large enough obliquity that it may be observable .",
    "planet at 1  au . as in figure",
    "[ fig : ibounce ] , the colours indicate planets ordered from smallest to largest in semi - major axis as follows : black(1=innermost ) , green(2 ) , cyan(3 ) , red(4 ) and blue(5 ) .",
    "the dotted magenta lines indicate the evolution of the perturber , which starts with zero eccentricity and inclination of @xmath109 .",
    "the two vertical dotted lines indicate when planetary collisions occur and the vertical dashed line signifies the collision of a planet with the star .",
    "[ fig : boom2 ] ]    the larger tilts also result in a lot more dynamical instability .",
    "a perturber with a @xmath84 tilt still leaves the bulk of planetary systems numbering from 35 . with a 30@xmath71 tilt ,",
    "the predominant multiplicity of surviving planetary systems is 2 or 3 .",
    "we repeat the experiment with an even larger perturber inclination , of @xmath109 , in order to examine how much additional attrition is possible ( experiment a4 ) . indeed , this reduces the surviving multiplicities to systems with only 1 or 2 surviving planets .",
    "this obviously also reduces the statistics @xmath115 and no triples are observed .",
    "more strikingly , this yields an improved value of @xmath116 for single tranets , twice that of the unperturbed systems , and closer to the observed value .",
    "the reason for this is the dynamically hotter surviving systems have quite a few planets with orbital periods shorter than the 4 day cutoff we impose .",
    "if we include all planets interior to 10 days , this ratio becomes 0.66 again .",
    "figure  [ fig : boom2 ] shows an example of the instability that occurs .",
    "it shows the same model system as in figure  [ fig : ibounce ] .",
    "once again the inclinations of the inner three planets grow coherently , but reach such magnitudes that nonlinear terms lead to eccentricity growth and eventually orbit crossing and scattering .",
    "the two innermost planets collide first and then the third and fourth planets collide .",
    "the remaining three planet system undergoes further interaction until one of the planets is excited to sufficient eccentricity to collide with the star .",
    "after @xmath27  years , there are only two planets remaining and these are subject to continued dynamical interaction that eventually lead to a collision at 2.9  myr .",
    "this leaves a single planet at 0.22  au , which undergoes oscillations in eccentricity from @xmath11700.2 and inclination from @xmath1172060@xmath71 due to continued perturbation from the external planet .",
    "other systems show evolution in the same general character ",
    "excitation to large enough inclinations prompts eccentricity growth and ultimately dynamical instability .",
    "this experiment appears to offer a scenario in which one can generate a large number of single tranet systems with impunity , since the perturbers are hard to detect with radial velocities",
    ". however , the surviving planets are dynamically quite hot , with quite a range of eccentricities and inclinations .",
    "the median inclination of observed tranets from experiment  a4 is @xmath118 , so measurements of stellar obliquity can potentially indicate the presence of such a population .",
    "we will examine this further in ",
    "[ datcomp ] .    in summary then , it is possible to reduce the tranet multiplicity by exciting the mutual inclinations of planetary systems with external planetary perturbers . however , we find that the level of excitation required to match the observations pushes many systems to the edge of dynamical instability and beyond .",
    "this leads to a reduction in the multiplicity as well , and thus it is worth examining the alternative pathway to this point ",
    "namely the excitation of eccentricity directly .",
    "in the classical limit , perturbations in eccentricity and inclination are independent and so , in principle , we can excite orbital eccentricity instead of inclination . indeed , radial velocity observations show that giant planets on large scales show a substantial range in eccentricities which will indeed provide secular pumping for interior planetary systems .",
    "the direct effect of non - zero eccentricities on transit probabilities is modest , but the pumping of eccentricities in multiple planet systems can drive the system towards dynamical instability . the merger or loss of planets can dramatically change the system parameters , and so we must also investigate this avenue .    in principle , one can perform a similar analysis to that of   [ lagoi ] for the case of eccentricities , but our goal here is to examine the effects of dynamical instability and so such an analysis is not as informative .",
    "we therefore proceed directly to the numerical experiments .",
    "let us now repeat our numerical experiments but for an almost coplanar , eccentric perturber .",
    "unlike our previous experiment , there is substantial observational guidance as to the strength of the perturbations in this case .",
    "indeed , the circular orbit of our prior inclination experiments is not really representative of the observed distribution for giant planets on scales @xmath10au . if we take the beta distribution of the observed long period planets from kipping ( 2013 ) , we find a median eccentricity @xmath119 .",
    "thus , we perform an experiment ( b1 )  integrating the same 50 systems but now with a perturber of eccentricity @xmath120 and semi - major axis 1.25  au ( to yield a periastron at the same distance as the semi - major axis in the prior experiments in order to keep the effects of direct scattering at a similar level )",
    ". we will again assume @xmath45 but keep the planet almost coplanar ( an inclination of @xmath58 to avoid overly artificial symmetries ) .",
    "we integrate these systems for @xmath121  myr and calculate the odds of transit as before .",
    "the resulting multiplicity ratios are @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "thus , the multiplicity ratios are reduced relative to the unperturbed case , but not as much as in experiments a1 , a3 and a4 , and certainly not to the point that they agree with observations .",
    "the ratio @xmath126 for singles , which is higher than the unperturbed systems , but still well short of observations .",
    "the value for the multi - tranet systems , @xmath127 , is in better agreement .",
    "the manner in which the reduction in multiplicity is achieved is also a little different . if we take the same five planet system as depicted in figure  [ fig : ibounce ] , we find that the inner four planets of the system are driven to merge into a single object by a series of collisions .",
    "the cause of this is the fact that the increased apsidal precession of the fifth planet , driven by the giant planet , brings it into secular resonance with a mode that couples the inner three planets , causing eccentricity pumping ( the fifth planet is approximately the same mass as the inner four combined ) of the inner system , to the point that their orbits cross and they collide .",
    "ultimately this leaves behind a widely separated two planet system .",
    "however , the pair has only a small inclination dispersion and still yields a relatively high ratio of @xmath61 ( although obviously no higher multiples ) !    in the case of the second system discussed before ( and shown in figure  [ fig : ibounce2 ] ) , the multiplicity is also reduced to two , but in this case it is the outer two planets that collide .",
    "the eccentricity of the outermost planet is pumped sufficiently strongly to cross the orbit of the second planet , leading to a collision .",
    "the resulting widely separated pair also has a sufficiently large dispersion in inclination that it also exhibits @xmath128 .",
    "the consequence of this is that the pumping of both eccentricity and inclination can serve to decrease the multiplicities , both of tranets and of the underlying planets . in the case of the tilted , circular @xmath45 perturber",
    ", 24/50 systems saw some reduction in the number of planets , whereas the eccentric perturber reduced the multiplicity in 31/50 systems . in total , these 31 systems saw 46 planetary collisions , 6 collisions with the star , 1 collision with the external perturber and 22 ejections . in this case 80% of the surviving systems have multiplicities between 25 , so a slight reduction relative to experiment  a1 , but still with many multiple planet systems .",
    "as in the case of the inclinations , we can also repeat the experiment with a smaller mass perturber . in experiment  b2",
    ", we rerun the simulations with the same semi - major axis and eccentricity , but with a perturber mass of @xmath104 .",
    "the resulting systems are much less affected by the perturbations and the resulting tranet multiplicities are @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 , too large to match the observations . furthermore , @xmath133 for the singles , which is similar to that of the unperturbed systems .",
    "thus , the reduced perturber mass does reduce the effect and results in multiplicity ratios closer to the unperturbed model and farther from the observations .    of course",
    ", we noted in ",
    "[ incpert ] that we can compensate for lower masses by increasing the level of excitation .",
    "thus , in experiment  b3 , we consider the effect of a 0.1  @xmath134 perturber with e=0.5 . in order to avoid direct scattering between the perturber and the unperturbed orbits , we now move the perturber semi - major axis out to 2  au .",
    "the results are less dramatic than in the inclination case , as @xmath135 , which is still too high to match observations .",
    "the higher multiplicity statistics are reduced though , with @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "the period distribution is also not markedly affected , with @xmath139 .",
    "figure  [ fig : rat3 ] summarises these results , by comparing the multiplicity ratios from the various experiments to those of the observed population .    , yields the dotted histogram .",
    "if we change the perturber to be coplanar but with an eccentricity of 0.2 ( and move it to semi - major axis 1.25  au ) , we get the short dashed histogram .",
    "if we instead perturb the systems with a mass reduced to 0.1  @xmath134 , and inclined by @xmath52 , we get the long dashed histogram .",
    "thus , moderate eccentricity perturbations preserve the higher multiplicity ratios , but do not lower the 2:1 ratio enough .",
    "moderate inclination perturbations reduce the 2:1 ratio sufficiently , but reduce the higher multiplicities too .",
    "all model populations are subjected to selection effects based on the christiansen et al .",
    "( 2016 ) injection - recovery tests , as described in the text .",
    "[ fig : rat3 ] ]    the consequence of these experiments is that the influence of a single moderate perturber can reduce the multiplicities at a sufficient level to match the observations , but requires planetary parameters that should be observationally testable . if the perturber has a moderate inclination or eccentricity , it must be of sufficient mass to be detectable by radial velocity surveys .",
    "alternatively , perturbers smaller than radial velocity limits can still disrupt systems if they have large enough inclinations . in this case , the surviving planetary systems display substantial obliquities .",
    "this suggests it should be possible to observationally probe such scenarios , and we examine this question in   [ datcomp ] .",
    "thus far , we have considered the effects of a single external perturber . in essence , the simulated systems are conceptually no different from the original unperturbed systems except that the coupling to the perturber can potentially alter the eigenvalues and increase their amplitudes to levels which may affect the observability or stability of the system",
    ".    however , if the perturbations result from a system of giant planets on larger scales , this has the potential for qualitatively different evolution .",
    "the presence of multiple giant planets means that they form a gravitationally interacting subsystem of their own , with its own characteristic secular oscillations .",
    "this opens up the possibility of resonance between the modes of the inner and outer systems , which can drive the oscillatory amplitudes to even larger amplitudes .",
    "indeed , the most dramatic potential consequences of secular perturbations in the solar system are not simply the result of jupiters presence , but rather its precession and the resonant interaction with the inner terrestrial planets ( e.g. lithwick & wu 2011 ; batygin , morbidelli & holman 2015 ) .",
    "a simple way to represent the effects of multiple external planets is if we impose a precession on the innermost perturber ( such as may be induced by a second giant planet ) , which amounts to a linear ramp in @xmath140 or @xmath141 , with some characteristic frequency .",
    "the aforementioned model is still well described by as a system of coupled harmonic oscillators , but now it also features a forced component , with a specific frequency .",

    "the mutual interactions result in a secular precession of the nodes with a frequency @xmath145 if we expect that the precession due to an external planet , located at semi - major axis @xmath146 , substantially influences the properties of the planet pair , then we anticipate that this precession @xmath147 should be comparable to or greater than @xmath148 .",
    "this is given by @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the mass of the external perturber , and we have assumed that the separation is large enough to approximate the laplace coefficient by it s leading order term .",
    "furthermore , if we wish to drive a resonant interaction with an outer planet pair , we also require that the mutual precession frequency of the outer pair be comparable , @xmath151 where @xmath152 is a function of @xmath153 , the semi - major axis ratio of the outer pair . in this case",
    "we have assumed that the two external planets are of equal mass @xmath150 .",

    "figure  [ fig : prec ] shows these constraints graphically .",
    "examination of this plot suggests that jupiter - mass planets at 1  au will drive precession down to @xmath117 0.3  au and that outer pairs with @xmath155 ( period ratios @xmath156 ) will have plenty of cross - section to interact with inner pairs on those scales .",

    "this suggests that the likely range of interest for external perturbations is perturbers in the range 15  au .",
    "also , it suggests that it does nt require extremely close giant planet pairs to have interesting interactions with the interior systems , as long as the inner planet is close enough .",

    "the inner trio of planets oscillate quite coherently as a unit , but eventually the eccentricity grows too and the two inner planets cross orbits and collide .",

    "the similarity of the precession rates is responsible for the enhanced amplitude of the oscilations .",
    "[ fig : ibounce3 ] ]    the consequence of this inclination pumping and dynamical instability is that the surviving planets are reduced in multiplicity ( now we find 80% of surviving systems have an underlying multiplicity of 13 planets ) and receive a larger dispersion in inclination and eccentricity .",

    "the dramatic change in @xmath20 is partly artificial because the pile - up straddles the 10-day orbital period boundary , but the sense of the shift is real .",
    "we can examine the effect of resonant location by running simulations with different spacings for the outer planet pair .",
    "if we run the same experiment but now with the second perturber shifted outwards to 4.5  au ( experiment  d2 ) , we find similar multiplicity statistics as in d1 , but now @xmath171 .",
    "the outward shift of the outer perturber lowers the frequency of the perturber secular oscillations , shifting the laplace - lagrange resonance inwards and reduces the number of collisions / mergers at 0.1  au and out .",
    "if we instead move the outer perturber inwards to 3  au while retaining the same eccentricities ( experiment  d3 ) then we find even greater instability .",
    "few double planet systems survive ( @xmath172 ) and the value of @xmath173 .",
    "this is because the eccentricity excitation is moved to larger scales , increasing the cross - section for collision and resulting in a substantial population of final planets in the range @xmath174  au .",
    "thus , we find that the best way to reduce the short period bias of single tranet systems is to pump the eccentricity on larger orbital scales , by virtue of closer giant planet pairs",
    ".      experiments c1 and d1 suggest that it is indeed possible to reduce the tranet multiplicity substantially with a sufficiently strong secular pumping",
    ". however , it seems to require multiple giant planets , and not every observed planet system is observed to contain multiple planets .",
    "can we achieve similar results with smaller mass planets ? we have already noted that a single perturber of mass @xmath2 yields notably weaker results but perhaps if only the outer member of the pair were smaller it would change the resonant frequency but the interior precession would still be significant .",
    "thus , in experiments  c2 , c3 and d4 , we repeat experiments c1 and d1 , but with the outermost external perturber mass of @xmath104 ( and all other parameters held the same ) .    in experiment c2 ,",
    "the inclination pumping with a smaller outer planet yields multiplicity ratios @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "the lower outer planet mass implies a smaller precession rate ( see equation  [ simharm ] ) for the pair , which , in turn , will shift the resonant location inwards ( equation  [ io ] ) . nominally one might hope that this improves the coupling to short period planets and increase @xmath179 , but the lower mass implies a much weaker driving , and the actual @xmath180 for singles , i.e. slightly worse than the unperturbed case .    of course , reducing the mass of one of the giant planets also shifts the frequencies of the two planet system and consequently the location of any resonances in the inner system .",
    "perhaps a more faithful comparison is to simultaneously move the outer planet inwards to a location such that the precession rate ( equation  [ simharm ] ) is preserved for the smaller perturber mass . for a @xmath104 planet",
    ", this requires that it be moved in to 2.934  au .",
    "the results ( denoting this experiment  c3 ) suggest a slightly stronger effect than in experiment  c2 , but still much weaker than experiment  c1 .",
    "in particular @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "furthermore @xmath185 , so there is little improvement in the period distribution either .    in experiment d4",
    ", we repeat the eccentricity excitation of experiment  d1 , but with the 0.1@xmath134 outer perturber .",
    "the eccentricity excitations are smaller but still lead to some level of dynamical instability and loss of at least one planet in 34/50 systems . however , this is a much weaker effect than in experiment  d1 ( and only 1 system lost all its planets ) , and the resulting multiplicity ratios are @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 . in both cases",
    "the results are a little smaller than for the unperturbed population but still higher than observed at low multiplicities , and together they suggest that we do indeed need multiple massive planets to substantially degrade the multiplicity of a planetary system .",
    "this is because we require planets massive enough to induce substantial precession on small scales , but they must also be driven with a similar frequency , which requires another planet of similar size .",
    "we must also question whether such close giant planets are sufficiently ubiquitous to meet our requirements .",
    "experiments c1 and d1 suggest that giant planets at @xmath190au are capable of substantially disrupting compact planetary systems , but can we do it with giant planets on larger scales ?",
    "figure  [ fig : prec ] indicates that the resonant excitation of the planetary systems was being driven on relatively small scales ( @xmath119 au ) and this is supported by the numerical results .",
    "however , planets on larger scales can still potentially drive instability if they couple to planets on scales @xmath190  au .",
    "thus , let us now consider experiments c4 and d5 , in which we repeat experiments c1 and d1 with more distant giant planet pairs .      in experiment c4 ,",
    "we place two @xmath45 mass planets on circular orbits at 3 and 5.6  au , with an inclination of 5@xmath71 and @xmath191 . because of the larger distance of the giant planets , we are now able to use the full complement of originally simulated planets , including those with semi - major axis @xmath1921  au .",
    "the resulting inclination excitations in this case are indeed weaker , but not negligible , and 13/50 systems cross the line into dynamical instability to the point of losing at least one planet .",

    "once again , the inclination of the three innermost planets exhibit substantial correlation but do not grow as large as in figure  [ fig : ibounce3 ] .    ]",
    "the resulting multiplicity ratios averaged over the 50 systems are @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "thus , it does reduce the tranet multiplicity , but not as much as when the planets are closer .",
    "also @xmath197 for the single tranet systems , so the results are still well skewed to short periods .    in experiment",
    "d5 , we retain the masses and seperations of c4 , but we pump the eccentricities instead of the inclinations , by giving the giant planets @xmath120 , @xmath198 and inclination of @xmath58 ( as in experiment  d1 ) . as expected , we find a greater level of dynamical instability . in 39/50 systems",
    "we see the loss of at least one planet , often several .",
    "we see a total of 76 planet collisions , 35 collisions with the star , and 7 ejected planets over the 50 simulations .",
    "we also see one case of a planet impacting one of the jupiters and one case where the interactions destabilise the outer giant planet pair , leading to the ejection of the outer giant planet . on the other hand , in 11 cases , we see no loss of planets at all . one pattern that emerges is that the resilient systems tend to have planet pairs that are close to second order mean motion resonances on scales @xmath190au . to quantify this ,",
    "figure  [ fig : stats ] shows the distribution of the statistics @xmath199 and @xmath200 , as defined by lissauer et al .",

    "the solid points show the values for the 11 such pairs in the systems in which no planet was lost .",
    "the @xmath199 values are spread almost uniformly but @xmath200 shows 8/11 with values @xmath201 . if we draw 11 samples randomly from a distribution function fit to the observed kepler distribution ( discussed in   [ prats ] )",
    "we find that this happens with a frequency of only @xmath202 .",
    "however , this distribution function does not take into account possible underlying trends with semi - major axis and systematic effects , so assigning a statistical significance is questionable .",
    "another test is to draw additional samples of 11 from the initial conditions of those systems that did lose at least one planet .",
    "two such samples are shown as crosses and open circles in figure  [ fig : stats ] . in these cases",
    "we find 1/11 and 3/11 with @xmath201 .",
    "such samples should occur with frequencies of 0.29 and 0.12 if we use the distribution function .",
    "thus , it does appear as though the surviving systems have an excess of outer pairs near a second order resonance ( most of these are the 3:1 , although there is one near 7:5 ) .",
    "( lower line ) and @xmath200 for the outer pair in the 11 systems where no planet was lost .",
    "the open circles and crosses show the same quantities for two other samples of 11 , drawn randomly from the initial conditions in systems where a planet was lost .",
    "the robust systems seem to show a concentration of @xmath201 .",
    "[ fig : stats ] ]    in the case of first order resonances , there is a well defined potential mechanism for this protection .",
    "the correction to the secular frequencies that results from such interactions ( malhotra et al . 1989 ; christou & murray 1997 ) raises the precession rates and makes the system more robust to the external perturbations by shifting the system away from resonance .",
    "a similar mechanism appears to be operating for the second order resonances , although the formalism does not translate directly to this case .    in terms of the statistics , @xmath203 , @xmath204 , @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "we also see @xmath207 for singles , which is closer to the expectations .",
    "planets ( experiment c1 ) , while the short dashed histogram show the effects of eccentricity pumping by the same pair ( experiment d1 ) .",
    "both of these have strong effects on the tranet multiplicity .",
    "the effects of inclination pumping by a more distant pair ( experiment c4  long dashed histogram ) are weaker but do reproduce the flatness of the observational trend .",
    "[ fig : rat4 ] ]    figure  [ fig : rat4 ] shows a summary of the effects of pairs of perturbers on the tranet multiplicities .",
    "we see that pairs with the inner member interior to 2  au can have significant effects , and can bring the single tranet fraction well below the observed limits .",
    "more distant pairs do reduce the multiplicity somewhat , but not enough to match the observations .      up to now",
    "we ve performed simulations of simple example cases , in which we look at the influence of different sets of perturbers , with fixed parameters within each experiment .",
    "what does the result for a plausible range of external parameter choices look like ?",
    "the eccentricity distribution can be characterised from the results of radial velocity observations , but the distribution of inclinations is poorly known .",
    "we thus need a theoretical model that links both the eccentricity and inclination distributions .",
    "juric & tremaine ( 2008 ) examined the hypothesis that the observed distribution of giant planet eccentricities was the result of planet - planet scattering and report the resulting distributions of both eccentricity and inclination .",
    "this gives us a set of perturbers whose eccentricities are chosen to match the observed distribution and which also possess a plausible range of inclinations , at least under the hypothesis that both are the result of planetary scattering .",
    "thus , we have also performed experiment  e1 , in which we place a single @xmath45 planet at 2  au , and draw our inclinations and eccentricities from the final results reported in juric and tremaine . we have moved the perturber out to 2  au because the eccentricities are larger than @xmath120 in many cases , and may remove many planets by direct scattering in that event , if started from 1.25  au .",
    "we choose both eccentricities and inclination from a distribution function of the form @xmath208 , where @xmath209 and @xmath210 , but this is an effect @xmath211 .",
    "as might be expected from a broader distribution , we see a full range of behaviours .",
    "indeed 14/50 systems retained all their planets , while 3/50 lost all their planets .",
    "the final statistics are @xmath212 , @xmath213 and @xmath214 .",
    "thus , there is a substantial effect .",
    "the ratio of @xmath215 for surviving single tranet systems .",
    "the obliquities of the surviving systems are not substantially larger than for prior experiments either , suggesting that the reduction is mostly the result of pumping eccentricity to the point of dynamical instability . in all , these 50 systems lose 63 planets to planet - planet collisions , 37 to collisions with the star , 5 to ejection and 1 to a collision with the perturber .",
    "these results suggest that introducing a giant planet perturber with the sort of amplitudes suggested by radial velocity observations can reduce the tranet multiplicities substantially , but it would require a large fraction of planetary systems to be subject to this kind of perturbation , much as in the case of experiment  a1 .      as we have seen , giant planet pairs have even greater effects by virtue of their ability to resonantly pump modes in the compact planetary system . to generate an planet pair equivalent to the single planetary systems of e1",
    ", we proceed as follows .",
    "we shall assume both planets have mass @xmath45 , and that the inner planet is again located at 2  au .",
    "the separation @xmath216 is drawn uniformly from between 0.2 and 0.6 , which encompasses the majority of known pairs whose inner member lies at semi - major axes @xmath10au .",
    "we then select eccentricities and inclinations from the same distributions as in   [ jt ] , and select the longitudes of periastron and ascending node randomly . for each pair",
    "we then integrate them with mercury for @xmath27 years and discard any systems whose inner semi - major axis has deviated by more than 1% . in this fashion",
    "we retain only those whose evolution is secular in nature , and which are not evolving by planetary scattering .",
    "the surviving pairs are more skewed to small @xmath217 than the original uniform distribution ( median value @xmath218 ) because closer pairs are more likely to be drawn with eccentricities such that orbits cross and thereby violate the secular assumption .",
    "the initial eccentricity distribution for the inner planet is also skewed to smaller values than in experiment  e1 , with fewer eccentricities @xmath219 .",
    "we then combine the resulting perturbing systems with our inner planet systems and integrate , making this experiment  f1 .",
    "as in the previous cases of pairs of perturbers , the results are stronger than in experiment  e1 .",
    "in this case 18/50 of the systems lose all their planets , and most ( 27 ) of the systems with a surviving interior planet are singles .",
    "the ratio of @xmath220 , with @xmath221 .",
    "it is also notable that there are as many planetary collisions with the star as there are planet - planet collisions .",
    "this certainly provides a distinct population of single tranets , but unfortunately the extreme dynamical instability yields @xmath222 , i.e. the survivors are even more biased to short periods than the original systems .",
    "this is because the high eccentricities bias the systems to large @xmath217 when we impose conditions of dynamical stability , and this favours low @xmath20 ( see   [ multiperte ] ) .",
    "this configuration is perhaps the most dynamically excited possible , given the constraints of long - term stability ( at least for the giant planet pair ) .",
    "we also test a less extreme version , experiment  f2 , in which we repeat this experiment but draw the eccentricities and inclinations for the giant planets from distributions with dispersions half that of those in experiment  f1 , although the separations are drawn from the same uniform distribution , and the inner jupiter is still located at 2  au .",
    "we also still test each planet pair for dynamical stability before combining it with an inner system .",
    "experiment  f2 yields @xmath223 , @xmath224 and @xmath225 . the period distribution for singles yields @xmath171 , so definitely an improvement over experiment  f1 , but only a modest improvement over the unperturbed population , and not enough to match the observations .",
    "how far out can a perturbing system be while still affecting the inner planets ? as we observed in ",
    "[ incpert ] , the effects of an distant inclined perturber is limited because the entire inner system tends to precess as a whole . on the other hand",
    ", we have found that eccentricity pumping is an important component although the results of experiment d5 suggest a limited effect .",
    "nevertheless , experiment  f1 shows that exploiting the full range of eccentricities and inclinations motivated by observations strongly affects interior planets .",
    "thus , to assess the effectiveness of distant , dynamically excited populations , we consider experiment  f3 , in which we postulate a pair of more massive @xmath142 planets , with the inner member at 5  au .",
    "this combination is chosen on the basis of the considerations shown in figure  [ fig : prec ] , such that the combination contributes competitively to the precession on scales inside 1  au .",
    "the semi - major axis of the outer member is then chosen by sampling a uniform distribution in semi - major axis ratios for the pair , and the eccentricities and inclinations are chosen from the undiluted distributions from juric & tremaine .",
    "as before , we reject those combinations which yield dynamically unstable configurations .",
    "the results suggest that massive , distant companions can still exert a substantial influence , with @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 and @xmath229 .",
    "this is indeed weaker than the corresponding closer case in experiment  f1 , but still sufficient to lower the single tranet frequency below the observed value .",
    "thus , we conclude that , once we account for the full range of observed eccentricities ( and equivalent inferred inclinations ) , giant planet perturbers as distant as 5  au can have a substantial influence on the compact planetary systems .",
    "up to this point , we have calculate the multiplicities for a variety of single populations , finding that some classes of perturber can reduce the multiplicities to observed values and maybe even lower them below the observed value .",
    "a more likely prospect is that the observed population is composed of multiple subpopulations . in particular , we want to consider here the case where some fraction of the population is composed of unperturbed , high multiplicity systems and the rest is drawn from one of the perturbed populations discussed above .",
    "if we adopt a model in which the compact planetary systems all form by in situ assembly , but some fraction @xmath230 is accompanied by external perturbations , then we can ask what combination is needed to match the multiplicity ratios ?",
    "let us assume the undisturbed model produces n planetary systems .",
    "the apportioning into different tranet multiplicities is such that @xmath231 where @xmath232 is the number of observed single tranet systems , @xmath233 is the number of double tranet systems , etc .",
    "the equivalent ratio between the total number of transitting systems to those with only single tranets is 1.552 ( or , equivalently , an average of 1.546 tranets peri transitting planet system ) .",
    "one can calculate a similar relationship for the systems that suffer perturbations .",
    "let us consider experiment  f2 as an example of a perturbing population . in this case ,",
    "@xmath234 , because there are far fewer multiple transit systems in the perturbed sample .",
    "if we combine this with the unperturbed systems in the proportions required to match our estimated observed value of @xmath235 , then we require @xmath236 where @xmath232 is the number of singles from the undisturbed population and @xmath237 is the number of singles from the disturbed population ( experiment  f2 in this case ) . to match the observations",
    "requires @xmath238 , which corresponds to a ratio between the total number of perturbed and unperturbed systems @xmath239 .",
    "thus , a mixed population in which @xmath240 of the underlying systems are drawn from experiment  f2 ( and the rest are unperturbed ) will match the observations . if we adopt @xmath241 as a baseline model , we get @xmath242 , @xmath243 , @xmath244 and @xmath245",
    ".    we can calculate similar mixtures for any case in which the perturbed population yields a value @xmath61 smaller than the observed value . in some cases , such as experiments  a1 , d1 & e1 , matching",
    "the observations require that most of the observed planetary systems correspond to the perturbed case . in others , such as a4 , d3 or f2",
    ", we can match the observed single tranet excess with populations that feature non - negligible fractions of unperturbed systems .",
    "let us construct three illustrative examples .",
    "first , consider the case in which we select 30% of the systems from experiment  d3 and the rest from the unperturbed sample .",
    "this represents an attempt to match the tranet frequencies while maximising the value of @xmath179 .",
    "the results of experiment  d3 overwhelmingly produce single planets , and these systems produce 40% of the single tranet systems in this combination , leading to @xmath246 .",
    "this combination also produces @xmath247 , which is closer to the observed value that any other combinations that match @xmath61 .",
    "a second example model is the case in which we select 30% of systems from experiment a4 and the rest from the unperturbed population .",
    "this provides @xmath248 .",
    "the difference in this case is that the perturbers are small enough to escape detection ( those of experiment  c1 or f2 are probably not ) through radial velocities .",
    "the value of @xmath20 is not as good a match , but this combination does also provide a potential signature in that the obliquity distribution of the single tranets is much wider than that of the multi - tranet systems .",
    "the same is not true for the model with a d3 component , indicating how we might eventually tease out the different contributions .    .",
    "finally , the solid histogram is constructed from a population that is 50% from experiment  f2 and 50% from unperturbed systems .",
    "[ fig : rat5 ] ]    finally , it is also possible to match up combinations from different experiments , to mimic broader distributions that are more likely to represent reality .",
    "let us consider a combination of 2/3 from experiment  f1 and 1/3 from experiment  f3 .",
    "this can represent a perturbing population with giant planets at a range of distances . in this case , @xmath249 , which is still well below the observations .",
    "however , we can now combine this mixed population with the unperturbed systems to match the observations . in this case",
    ", we once again consider @xmath250 ( split 2:1 between f1 and f3 ) , yielding @xmath251 , @xmath252 , @xmath253 and @xmath254 . in this case",
    ", @xmath20 is still too low , but there is still a potentially measurable difference in obliquities between singles and multiples .",
    "figure  [ fig : rat5 ] compares these combined models to the observations .",
    "they are all chosen to reproduce the ratio @xmath61 , and then provide a range of values for higher multiplicities .",
    "thus , we find that it is possible to at least get close to the observations by combining the results of different experiments .",
    "however , different choices imply different results for other observables , which may offer additional pathways to discerning which effect actually dominates the observed systems .",
    "we have thus far considered only the effects of secular pumping on timescales of 10  myr , and this certainly proves to be enough time to substantially modify many of the observed systems . however",
    ", this does not exclude the possibility of further evolution due to the accumulation of weaker nonlinear effects on gyr timescales .",
    "thus , we must consider whether the systems modelled here will change their character significantly before we observe them , due to the growth of further , longer - term dynamical instabilities .    on the other hand , many of these planetary systems still retain planets on small orbital scales , where tidal effects can serve to damp eccentricities .",
    "indeed , the combination of tidal dissipation and secular coupling can serve to stabilise many systems against further dynamical evolution ( hm15 ) .",
    "as noted by several authors ( greenberg & van laerhoven 2011 ; laskar , boue & correia 2012 ) , the combination of secular coupling and tidal evolution can result in the damping of eccentricity of several planets , not just the innermost .",
    "hm15 investigated this effect in the context of the unperturbed systems discussed here and concluded that tides which circularise individual planets out to periods @xmath18  days could potentially circularise orbits in secularly coupled systems out to periods @xmath255  days .",
    "the increased dynamical excitation in the systems studied here leads to higher eccentricities and thus can potentially drive stronger evolution .",
    "a full examination of the consequences would require estimates of the strength of tidal dissipation and is beyond the scope of this investigation .",
    "however , hm15 described the basic character of the unperturbed systems and their evolution under the effects of tides",
    ". we can assess the broad effects of tidal disspation by applying the following conclusions of hm15 to our results .",
    "we assume that , if the innermost surviving planet in the system has a periastron @xmath256au , it has the potential for tidal circularisation .",
    "this is estimated on the basis of the formalism outlined in hansen ( 2010 ) , assuming a planet of @xmath28 and @xmath257 with an eccentricity of 0.5 and a strength of tidal dissipation corresponding to q=1000 ( which is a relatively weak dissipation compared to earth but comparable to that of mars , which is probably a better analogue for desiccated rocky planets like those on short period orbits ) . in that event , we circularise all surviving planets with orbital periods @xmath258100  days , and move the innermost planet inwards to conserve the total system angular momentum .    in cases such as experiments a3 , a4 or f1 , the dynamical evolution is so extensive that most surviving systems are either single planets or widely separated multiples , so that secular interactions have little influence on the tidal evolution .",
    "the largest effects are seen in cases where the eccentricities are excited to significant levels , but low enough that the system retains some level of multiplicity . in this case",
    ", secular interactions can continually pump the eccentricity of the inner , tidally evolving planet , thereby circularising all planets with substantial secular interactions with the inner planet ( as described in hm15 ) . in the case of experiment  d1 for example ,",
    "20/50 systems experience some level of inward migration due to tidal evolution . in some cases",
    ", this is a relatively minor shift , but , in other cases , the inner planet can migrate well inside the nominal inner edge of the initial conditions .",
    "the most dramatic case involves a system in which three planets survive in addition to the two perturbing jupiters .",
    "the innermost is a 2.8@xmath259 planet in a 5.4  day orbit , while another is 7.2@xmath259 planet on a 28.3  day orbit .",
    "this second planet has an eccentricity of e=0.504 at the end of the simulation and consequently exhibits a substantial angular momentum deficit , which the tidal migration of the smaller planet must fill ( the third planet has an orbital period of 154.6  days and is essentially decoupled ) . in order to completely circularise the second body ,",
    "the innermost must migrate down to an orbital period of 7.1  hours !",
    "such an evolutionary pathways offers another route to the very short period planets observed by kepler ( rappaport et al . , 2012 , 2014 ; sanchis - ojeda et al .",
    "2013 , 2015 ; jackson et al . 2013 ) .    indeed , this and other systems with substantial excitation provide a mechanism to populate orbits with orbital periods too short to be populated by in situ accretion ",
    "an objection to this model raised in the past by some authors , such as swift et al .",
    "( 2013 ) . to illustrate",
    ", we can calculate @xmath260 , a statistic similar to @xmath20 but consisting of the relative fraction of all single tranets observed with periods @xmath156  days compared to those with orbital periods between 410 days .",
    "if we apply the above procedure to all the systems in experiment  d1 and repeat the estimates of transit probabilities , we find that @xmath20 is reduced to @xmath261 but that @xmath262 , substantially higher than the value of @xmath263 before the correction for tidal evolution is applied .",
    "the corresponding number for the unperturbed population is @xmath264 and the observed value ( if we relax our period cut but retain the stellar and magnitude limits ) is @xmath265 .",
    "thus , tidal evolution can , in principle , populate shorter periods at the needed rate .    the experiments drawn from the juric & tremaine distributions also show a healthy population of short period orbits .",
    "experiment  f1 shows @xmath266 even before the inclusion of tidal evolution because of the large level of dynamical excitation in this experiment .",
    "the equivalent values for experiments f2 and f3 are 0 and @xmath267 respectively . however , after the inclusion of tidal evolution , all three experiments show healthy populations of tranets with p@xmath2584  days . in the case of experiment f1 , @xmath268 , while it is @xmath269 and @xmath270 for experiments f2 and f3 .",
    "thus , the level of dynamical excitation observed in these experiments is sufficient to generate numbers of short period planets comparable to that observed , if we include the effects of tidal evolution .",
    "the calculations described here focus on the dynamical instabilities that result if the external secular pumping were sufficiently strong to lead to orbit crossing within 10  myr .",
    "it is still an open question as to whether longer term evolution may lead some additional systems to reach instability by virtue of smaller , nonlinear effects that may slowly lead to eccentricity growth and orbit crossing .",
    "such ` secular chaos ' may operate in a variety of planetary systems ( e.g. lithwick & wu 2014 ) .",
    "we can estimate the sensitivity of our systems to long - term chaos by calculating the total angular momentum deficit for the system ( laskar 1997 ) , as @xmath271 where the sum is over all the planets in the system . as discussed by laskar",
    ", this quantity is approximately conserved in a global sense during the system evolution .",
    "if nonlinear effects allow mixing of this deficit amongst the planets , one could imagine a situation where , in principle , all but one of planets in the system instantaneously occupy circular , coplanar orbits , resulting in the concentration of @xmath272 in the orbit of a single planet , yielding a maximal eccentricity for that planet .",
    "if this maximum eccentricity allows for crossing orbits then planet - planet scattering can break the secular assumption and lead to further dynamical instability .",
    "if orbit crossing is not achieved even under such extreme circumstances , the system is probably stable in the long term .",
    "if we calculate the possibility of orbit crossing in this manner for the 50 unperturbed systems used here , we find that 23/50 have the possibility of instability , given the parameters that emerge from the dynamical evolution .",
    "however , as discussed in hm15 , the value of @xmath272 is probably diminished substantially by the combined effects of tidal evolution and secular interactions , which will have the tendency to circularise the orbits of all planets that are secularly coupled to the inner planet , rendering such systems stable .",
    "if we set the eccentricities ( but not inclinations ) in the calculation of @xmath272 to be zero from all planets with @xmath273au ( essentially the prescription discussed in   [ tidev ] ) , then we are left with only 3/50 of the original unperturbed systems with even a small likelihood of longer term orbit crossing .    for the perturbed systems",
    ", we do not include the giant planet perturbers in the calculation of equation  ( [ amdeq ] ) .",
    "to do so would automatically render a system potentially unstable , because the large mass of the perturbers will overwhelm any contributions from the interior planets .",
    "however , the limited expected feedback from the small planets on the large means that we do not realistically expect to feed all of the angular momentum deficit of the large planets into the interior system .",
    "this is similar to the rationale of laskar ( 1997 ) for separating the inner and outer solar system planets .",
    "can longer - term dynamical instability lower the multiplicity for those experiments which gave too large a value of @xmath61 ?",
    "for example , if we calculate the potential for stability in the results of experiment  a1 , the increased excitation of eccentricity and inclination allow for the possibility of long - term instability in 40/50 of the modelled systems , although this decreases to 13/50 if we estimate the effects of tides as above . in the equivalent case of eccentricity",
    "forcing , experiment  b1 , the number of potentially unstable systems is only 12/50 and none satisfy the criteria if we take tidal damping into account .",
    "the tendency to greater stability is , in part , due to lower surviving multiplicity , but also because of the lower inclinations in this case .",
    "the results of all the experiments show the same trends  those with moderate excitation produce many systems with global @xmath272 that can , in principle , lead to instability on gyr timescales , but most are stabilised by the effects of tidal damping because the secular coupling extends the reach of circularisation out to periods @xmath255  days .",
    "furthermore , the experiments with the greatest level of dynamical excitation produce surviving systems that are sufficiently sparse that they are unlikely to be unstable .",
    "for instance , of the 45 surviving planetary systems produced by experiment  f2 ( 5 lost all their original planets ) , none have a large enough @xmath272 value , even before tides are included .",
    "thus we conclude that longer - term chaotic evolution of these model systems are not likely to substantially change the conclusions we draw .",
    "while some potential for further dynamical evolution certainly remains ( although the above estimate somewhat overstates the likelihood ) in many of the modelled systems , it is lower in those experiments that do a good job of matching the observations .",
    "while further evolution could potentially improve the agreement with observation in some experiments ( like a1 or c1 ) , it must also be noted that the effects of tides operate in precisely the region ( orbital periods @xmath274  days ) that is most important for comparing to observations and so reduce the likelihood of substantial evolution .",
    "thus , we will assume that the estimates based on our simulations hold even after @xmath190gyr of further secular evolution .",
    "we have seen in the above sections that it is possible , at least in principle , to reduce the tranet multiplicity in our model systems to the point that it can match the observed distribution .",
    "however , it is now necessary to ask whether the kinds of perturbations required are reasonable or can be tested by other observations .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the above results suggest that , with a sufficiently high rate of perturbing systems , it seems possible to explain the excess of single tranet systems with respect to unperturbed systems , and possibly even the period distribution as well . however , is the frequency of perturbers that is required beyond observed constraints ?",
    "an important issue that matters in this comparison is whether the false positive incidence is similar in both the single and multiple tranet samples .",
    "it has been discussed at length that the false positive rate is low in the kepler multi - tranet systems ( lissauer et al .",
    "2011a ; fabrycky et al . 2014 ) , but the same reasoning can not be applied to the single tranet systems . in the case of manual candidate selection , there may be a bias towards finding more planets in multiple systems due to increased scrutiny , but the latest kepler sample is supposedly selected entirely automatically ( coughlin et al .",
    "if the false positive rate amongst the single tranet candidate systems is @xmath275 , then this could explain the discrepancy in @xmath20 between single and multiple tranets without invoking any kind of perturbation .",

    "radial velocity follow - up for giant planet candidates ( santerne et al .",

    "2014 ) , and spitzer confirmation studies ( desert et al .",
    "2015 ) all suggest that the false positive rate for candidates with @xmath1 is of the order of 15% or less , which is too small to account for the observed single tranet excess . only coln et al .",
    "( 2012 ) find a 50% false positive rate in their study of 4 short period ( p@xmath276 days ) kepler candidates , but their sample is largely excluded by our minimum period cut .",

    "a variety of authors have tried to estimate the occurrence rate of planet detections around sun - like stars ( borucki et al .",
    "2011 ; catanzarite & shao 2011 ; youdin 2011 ; howard et al . 2012 ; dong & zhu 2013 , fressin et al .",

    "nevertheless it agrees with the estimate of @xmath286 from youdin ( 2011 )",
    ".    given these empirically estimated occurrence rates , we can predict , for a given model of the underlying planetary population , what occurrence rate of perturbers we require . in the simplest case where a single experiment result matches the observed @xmath61 value , we might then predict an overall frequency from the c15 result by dividing by the corresponding @xmath281 . for experiment  a1 , this would imply an overall frequency of @xmath287% and , for experiment  d1 , we would predict @xmath288% .",
    "these are both consistent with the phm estimate , but underpredict the higher multiplicity tranet systems .",
    "a more plausible estimate comes from the various combinations given in table  [ tab : trantab ] and figure  [ fig : rat5 ] . in the case of the best fit model from figure",
    "[ fig : rat5 ] , which contains 40% from experiment  f2 and 60% unperturbed systems , @xmath289 and thus the c15 estimate corresponds to @xmath290 , in excellent agreement with the phm estimate . in this case",
    ", @xmath29140% of all systems with tranets have perturbers in longer period orbits",
    ". we also have to account for the fact that 5/50 of the experiment  f2 runs yielded no surviving planets interior to 1  au and so will not be included in the above estimate , but will contribute to a potentially observable populaton of perturbers .",
    "as such , our fit corresponds to a true perturber frequency of @xmath292 . combining this with the empirical occurrence rates , we expect an overall frequency of @xmath293 from c15 , or @xmath294 from phm .",
    "this corresponds to candidates with @xmath295 .",
    "we get very similar results for the case of 30% d3 ( @xmath296 ) . or 30% a4 ( @xmath297 ) .",
    "perhaps the most realistic estimate is to combine the results of experiments f1 and f3 to represent a perturber population with a range of inner perturber locations .",
    "if we select a perturber population that is 2/3 from f1 and 1/3 from f3 , and make this 1/3 of all systems , then we expect a population that has 22% of systems with perturbers at 2  au and 11% with perturbers at 5  au .",
    "however , these experiments are also the most dynamically excited , and so we need to increase the frequency by a factor of 1.47 for f1 and 1.25 for f3 ( to account for systems with no surviving inner planets ) . if we restrict ourselves to the @xmath295 planets , we thus require @xmath298 from f1 and @xmath299 from f3 , for a total of @xmath300 .",
    "the low mass planet population is not restricted to @xmath295 however . if we extend our sample definition to include larger radii planets , the occurrence rates also increase .",
    "phm extended their analysis up to @xmath301 .",
    "so , if we assume that the planets with radii from 24  @xmath302 have similar origins to those with @xmath295 , perhaps with just a small additional hydrogen envelope , then the total occurrence rate over the same period range increases to @xmath303 .",
    "thus , if we repeat our fit of the model with @xmath29140% from experiment  f2 , then we require a frequency of @xmath304 of all stars be orbited by perturbing giant planets .",
    "alternatively , our model constructed from f1 and f3 implies frequencies of @xmath305 and @xmath306 respectively .    other possible mixtures ( 40% a3 or 30% a4 ) yield very similar estimates , since @xmath281=1.36 and 1.39 in these two cases as well .",
    "one important difference in these two cases is that the perturbers are now small enough to potentially avoid constraints from radial velocity surveys , which makes the estimated companion frequency harder to constrain .    despite the potential variations in perturber populations , the requirement that the combination of perturbed and unperturbed populations match the tranet multiplicity statistics",
    "enforces a robust estimate of the needed occurrence frequency of such perturbing planets .",
    "if we base our projections purely on the sample of planets with @xmath295 , then we require that @xmath307 of fgk stars must possess giant planets on scales of @xmath11715  au . if we require that planetary systems containing planets up to @xmath308 are sculpted by this process , then our estimates lie closer to @xmath309 .",
    "such perturbers are potentially already constrained by existing and ongoing surveys .",
    "simple estimates of the yields from radial velocity surveys given in udry & santos ( 2007 ) suggest that the coralie , keck and elodie surveys all yield rates @xmath11757% of search targets .",
    "more sophisticated analyses including selection effects have been performed by cumming et al .",

    "as we have shown , planets with larger semi - major axis can still have an influence , but it is weaker and such perturbers are not likely to produce enough low tranet systems to match the observations .    from table  1 of cumming",
    "et al . ( 2008 ) , we find a frequency of @xmath310 for planets with masses 115@xmath134 and periods less than 11.2  years ( corresponding to a semi - major axis of 5  au ) , as measured by the keck radial velocity survey .",
    "we subtract the frequency of @xmath311% for corresponding planets interior to 1  au , leaving us with a frequency of @xmath312% .",
    "if we lower the mass limit to @xmath313 , we find an additional @xmath314 of planets between 13  au ( detection limits restrict the sample within 3  au ) .",
    "thus , the frequency corresponding to classes of perturbation considered in the above experiments is @xmath315 .",
    "this is , of course , a lower limit and indeed , cumming et al .",
    "fit a power law distribution to the known data and extrapolate that up to 20% of stars may have gas giants if one extends the range out to 20  au .    a similar analysis of the harps / coralie survey by mayor et al .",
    "( 2011 ) yields a frequency of @xmath316% for planets with mass @xmath317 and period less than 10  years .",
    "this is comparable to the @xmath318% we infer from the corresponding numbers in cumming et al .",
    "thus , if we consider the acceptable range for inner perturbers to be 5  au , we may take the frequency of jupiter mass perturbers to be @xmath319 .",
    "this matches well the required abundance of perturbers if we restrict our attention to the frequency of short period planets with @xmath295 .",
    "if we wish to explain the frequency of planets up to @xmath1 , then the rv census appears to fall short by a factor of two .",
    "however , we have shown that a population of sub - saturn mass planets , which can evade rv detection , can also provide sufficient perturbations if it is dynamically hot enough",
    ". this could fill in the gap if the demographics are comparable to that of the more massive planets .",
    "another important feature of our model is that the largest effects come from systems with _",
    "giant planets , so the effectiveness of this model also depends on the fraction of giant planet companions with companions .",
    "bryan et al .",
    "( 2016 ) have analysed the frequency with which known giant planets are accompanied by radial velocity trends suggesting more distant companions .",
    "they find that , for planets with @xmath320 and @xmath321au , the frequency of additional companions on scales @xmath322au is at least @xmath323% , suggesting that a lot of the known potential perturbers are in multiple systems .      in principle , the kepler data can be used to constrain the frequency of perturbers directly .",
    "the probability of a transit drops with increasing semi - major axis , but the large number of kepler observations implies a non - zero sample of transitting planets at @xmath10  au scales nevertheless .    for each perturber scenario , we can estimate the probability of observing the perturbers in transit as well as interior tranets . in the case of experiment  f2 , we find that the expected number of single tranets due to perturbers should be @xmath324 that of the number of single tranets due to smaller , interior planets .",
    "furthermore , a fraction of the total long period transits should also occur with one or more tranets at shorter periods .",
    "for this scenario , there should be an increase in the total number of long period tranets by a factor 1.22 relative to single , long - period tranets .",
    "therefore , we may predict that for the case in which 40% of systems are perturbed in this fashion ( which fits the multiplicity statistics in figure  [ fig : rat5 ] best ) , @xmath325 single long - period tranets ( @xmath326 total ) should be found , based on the 1115 single tranets in our observational data set .    in the case where the perturber is smaller , but closer , like in experiment  a4 , the probability increases . for the scenario which contains 30% of a4 in addition to unperturbed systems ,",
    "the overall expected frequency of transitting perturbers is @xmath327 of all single tranets , yielding an expectation of @xmath328 in the kepler sample .",
    "the greater inclination dispersion results in fewer in multi - tranet systems , only 4/32 .    as another example",
    ", we can also estimate the expected number in the case where our perturbing population contributes 1/3 of all systems and is split between experiment  f1 and experiment  f3 , as described in ",
    "[ 2many ] . in this case , the contribution from experiment  f3 is poorly sampled because the orbital periods are long compared to the kepler mission lifetime .",
    "we find that @xmath329 of all single tranets are drawn from experiment  f1 , but that accounting for those perturber systems which remove all planets raises the equivalent number to 44% .",
    "the expected frequency of perturbers is almost identical to that in experiment  f2 and so we find a similar expectation value .",
    "although the experiment  f1 results make a smaller contribution to the observed tranet population , the higher rate of excitation means more systems are completely emptied of planets , bringing the required underlying population of perturbers to the same value once the results are normalised to the observed tranet ratio .",
    "although the nominal kepler detection threshold for tranet detection requires three transits during the mission lifetime , there have been several recent efforts to systematically search for , and verify , candidate systems with only single transits in the kepler database ( wang et al .",
    "2015 ; uehara et al . 2016 ; foreman - mackey et al .",
    "these searches have produced a number of candidates and suggest that the overall occurrence frequency of these objects is quite high .",
    "the most systematic attempt to measure completeness and exclude false positives is that of foreman - mackey , who find a total of 16 single transit tranets from a search of 39036 sun - like kepler stars .",
    "this is encouragingly close to the fraction we expect , although one must be cautious about different systematics between the foreman - mackey search and the nominal kepler pipeline .",
    "foreman - mackey et al also find 5/16 = @xmath330 of these planets are in systems with additional transitting planets , which is again in good agreement with our expectations .",
    "furthermore , their table  6 demonstrates that @xmath331 of this population is composed of planets with @xmath332 , suggesting that the sub - jovian population is the dominant contributor .",
    "such a split may also make this claim consistent with the constraints based on radial velocity searches .",
    "we conclude that there is indeed evidence in the kepler data for a population of perturbers at long periods that may be sufficient to explain the single tranet excess , and that the observational results are consistent with the notion that approximately half the population is composed of genuine giant planets and the other half may be composed of sub - saturn planets .",
    "this population would also need to be sufficiently dynamically hot to perturb the interior systems sufficiently . such a population may also help to address the shortfall found in ",
    "[ rv ] , where the rv census of jupiter - mass planets appeared to fall short by a similar factor .    as a test of the influence of such a mixed population ,",
    "we include in table  [ tab : trantab ] the properties of a model population that is composed of 60% unperturbed systems , 20% drawn from experiment  a4 and 20% from experiment  d3 .",
    "the combination provides a decent match to the transit multiplicities and the contribution from experiment  d3 also leads to an improved value of @xmath333 , although it still falls a little short of the observations .",
    "such a model also has a better chance of meeting the requirements of radial velocity surveys , as it would require only that @xmath294 of fgk stars host jupiter - scale companions to match the @xmath334 overall occurrence rate from phm .      as noted before , one way to avoid the constraints from radial velocity observations is to invoke perturbers that are too small to be detected in that way .",
    "however , in order for such perturbers to exert a substantial effect , they need to have substantial amplitudes .",
    "in particular , we have investigated the influence of @xmath104 planets with high inclinations .",
    "these , in turn , leave surviving planets on highly inclined orbits .",
    "the difference between eccentricity pumping and high inclination perturbers may be testable by studying the obliquities of kepler planet candidates .",
    "figure  [ fig : stilts ] shows the inclination of the single tranets observed in four model populations that illustrate the consequences of different mechanisms of excitation . in the upper panel , the black histogram is the obliquity distribution ( defined as the inclination of the orbital plane relative to the original planetesimal disk plane , assumed to represent the stellar spin equator ) of the original , unperturbed , planet population .",
    "we see that the great majority are found within 15@xmath71 of the original orbital plane .",
    "the green histogram in the same panel shows the distribution that results from experiment  d3 , in which the perturbers drive strong eccentricity growth , but are largely coplanar .",
    "we see that only a small shift in the obliquities is to be expected in this event .",
    "on the other hand , the lower panel shows two populations with greater inclination excitation .",
    "the blue histogram shows the distribution for single tranets that result from experiment  f2 .",
    "this is one of the more promising sources for raising the number of single tranets observed and achieving agreement with the observations ( see figure  [ fig : rat5 ] ) . in this case",
    "we have dynamical heating from both eccentricity and inclination , and so we do observe some broadening of the obliquity distribution .",
    "the red histogram shows the results of experiment  a4 , in which orbits are perturbed by a @xmath104 planet inclined at 60@xmath71 with respect to the original plane .",
    "we see that the resulting dynamical instability leaves a wide range of obliquities , including a prominent peak at the perturber value and values that approach polar orbits .",
    "thus , we conclude that a measurement of the single tranet obliquity distribution can , in principle , indicate that planetary systems are being perturbed by a population of bodies that are highly inclined , even if they are too small to be detected in radial velocity searches .     but of mass @xmath104 .",

    "evidence to date suggests their orbits are much closer to coplanar than those of short period giant planets , but there are hints that single tranet systems may have a larger dispersion in obliquities than multiple tranet systems ( morton & winn 2014 ) .",
    "this would argue in favour of the model presented here and could potentially even offer the possibility of distinguishing between possibilities as the data improve .",

    "the blue histogram represents our best case in this regard , namely a population that is 30% drawn from experiment  d3 and 70% from the unperturbed population .",
    "we see that the pile - up of single tranets in the range 1015  days improves the @xmath20 statistic , but still underpredicts the counts at longer periods .",

    "the observations show 4% whereas the smoothed distribution predicts 5% .",
    "thus , in truth , the excess near the 3:2 resonance represents about 4% of all planet pairs , and there is very little difference in overall frequency near the 2:1 resonance  although the distribution indeed appears asymmetric ( the evident dip is partially cancelled by a slight excess at larger values ) .",

    "we can now repeat the exercise with the outputs of the various experiments . in no case",
    "do we find a significant increase .",
    "the fraction of pairs near the 3:2 resonance ranges from 3.1% ( experiment  c4 ) to almost zero ( e.g. experiment  d1 ) . similarly the fraction near the 2:1 resonance remains between 7 and 8% for weaker perturbations ( experiments c2 & c3 ) but again drops to about 3% in the case of stronger perturbations ( experiments  a4 , d1 , f1 , f2 , f3 ) .",
    "in essence we find no evidence in our model for a significant increase of survival for near - resonant neighbouring pairs .",
    "this failure to reproduce the observational signature stems from the fact that dynamical instabilities play a substantial role in the experiments that fit the data , and planet - planet scattering and collision overrides subtleties in the secular architecture .",
    "this may seem at odds with the results of   [ modis ] , which found that resonant effects ( albeit mostly second - order ) seemed to play a role in protecting some systems from secular instability .",
    "however , we note that these effects occur on scales @xmath190au and so are severely under - represented in a sample observed in transits .",
    "we also found that the perturbations in that experiment were too weak to explain the observations .",
    "another potentially observable consequence of secular perturbations is its effect on the planets themselves .",
    "orbital instability is associated with scattering and planetary collisions , which may result in differences between the observable properties of planets that suffered late - time collisions and those that did not .",
    "if we consider the results of experiment  f2 , we find that the evolution of 50 systems yields a total of 77 planet collisions , 59 collisions of a planet with the star and 9 ejections .",
    "of the 86 surviving non - jovian planets , 33 suffered at least one collision ( 38 % ) .",
    "the incidence of collisions is higher for short period survivors , and so , when we weight the fraction by transit probability , we find that we expect 64% of single tranets derived from experiment  f2 to have experienced at least one collision with another planet .",
    "therefore , in population defined by a mixture of experiment  f2 and unperturbed systems , we might anticipate that the single tranet population would be composed of a higher fraction ( @xmath347 ) of tranets that have experienced a late collision .",

    "if this material is that which is most easily lost during collisions , we might expect the single tranet population to have fewer low density members ( see inamdar & schlichting 2015 for a related discussion concerning the effects of late giant impacts during the assembly process ) .",

    "however , it is notable that 3/5 of the single tranets have @xmath348 while only 3/42 of those in multiple systems do .",
    "we choose this radius range under the assumption that the products of planetary collisions will be more massive than average but will also have lost any low density component .",

    "we urge more radial velocity measurements of single tranet systems to examine whether this tantalising but statistically marginal difference between single and multiple tranet systems is real .",
    "one of the striking aspects of the simulations shown here is the high rate of stellar collisions , which contributes to the reduction of multiplicity at a rate that is non - negligible relative to planetary collisions , and well above that due to planetary ejections . as we discuss in   [ multiperte ] and   [ rlo ] , some of these systems may not be absorbed or disrupted and may be tidally captured into extremely short period orbits , possibly matching a population emerging from observations .",

    "fig : ages ] ]    the conclusion we draw is that unstable systems experience most of their instability quite rapidly , and the surviving systems are quite widely spaced and dynamically stable by the age of 10  myr .",
    "the effects of planetary collisions may reasonably be expected to produce substantial quantities of dust , but these results suggest that there may be little measurable delay between planet assembly and instability , except for that potentially imposed by any offsets between the formation of the interior planets and the perturbing giant planets . as such , it is not clear that we should expect any discernable interval between different epochs ( assembly and subsequent instability ) that show infrared excesses that result from the production of dust .",
    "these results also suggest that the rate of stellar collisions should be @xmath352 per year per star .",
    "as we have noted before , it is possible that tidal interactions may capture planets from grazing orbits into short period orbits before they collide with the star .",
    "this could provide a mechanism to population the usp population of planets identified in the kepler data .",

    "for the model where experiment  f2 provides 40% of the underlying planetary population and that is used to explain the existence of detectable planets around 57% of all fgk stars , this implies @xmath354 of all stars experience at least one planet collision .",
    "thus , if only 4% of these events result in surviving planets , that would match the observed frequency .    in the case",
    "where the planets are driven to short period orbits by the combination of secular excitation and tidal dissipation , the observed frequency of migration interior to 10 hours period is @xmath355 in experiment  d1 .",
    "the application of experiment  d1 to the transit multiplicities requires an unreasonably high frequency of perturbers , but does produce @xmath20 that matches observations .",

    "our goal in these calculations has been to explore the effects of secular pumping of low mass , compact planetary systems by giant planets on larger scales .",
    "we consider the effects of independently driving inclination and eccentricity , as well as the influence of single perturbers versus pairs of perturbers .",
    "our first conclusion is that the pumping of inclination alone can not produce enough single tranet systems to match observations without driving a significant fraction of the systems to a state of dynamical instability .",
    "thus , we expect that the single tranet systems must contain a significant number of intrinsically low multiplicity systems .",
    "this is consistent with attempts to fit the demographics to simple distributions(fang & margot 2012 ; dong & tremaine 2012 ) as well as with estimates based on the frequency of transit timing variations ( xie , wu & lithwick 2014 ) .    as a consequence of this conclusion",
    ", we also investigated the effect of driving larger inclinations as well as eccentricity directly , in order to examine how the reduction in planet multiplicity manifests itself in the transit statistics .",
    "we then examined the implications of potentially successful scenarios for other observables .",
    "experiments a1 , d1 and e1 all yield sufficient reduction in @xmath61 to match the observations .",
    "these each represent somewhat different perturber populations .",
    "experiment  a1 represents the pumping of inclination directly by a single inclined jupiter mass perturber , experiment  d1 demonstrates how a pair of jupiter mass planets can pump eccentricity , and experiment  e1 shows the effects of a single jupiter mass planet when the eccentricity and inclination are chosen from a distribution chosen to match the observed properties of jovian planets on large scales .",
    "these scenarios alone are also all unsatisfactory for multiple reasons .",
    "while they match the ratio of single to double tranet systems , they all underpredict the frequency of systems of higher tranet multiplicity .",
    "this is not surprising , as the level of dynamical excitation required to satisfy the former constraint naturally works against the latter .",
    "furthermore , if any of these scenarios were the explanation for the observed properties , they would imply that nearly every system with planets on short period orbits possesses a perturber on larger scales , because the value of @xmath61 from the model is only slightly below the observed value .",
    "we have reviewed estimates of the observed frequency of potential perturber systems around stars and conclude that the required frequency is in well in excess of the current constraints from radial velocities .",
    "a more promising route is to consider even stronger perturbations , that reduce the underlying multiplicity substantially , but only in a fraction of the systems .",
    "we thus posit that the observed planetary population corresponds to a combination of systems without perturbers , exhibiting small inclination dispersions and high multiplicity , and systems of low multiplicity and high excitation , born of the original high multiplicity systems but denuded by the operation of a population of jovian mass perturbers .",
    "table  [ tab : trantab ] presents several combinations of this type , utilising particularly the results of experiments a3 , a4 , c1 , d3 , f1 , f2 and f3 .",
    "the latter five here all offer some variation on the theme of two external perturbers with a range of eccentricities and inclinations . these pump sufficient eccentricity into the interior system to drive substantial dynamical instability .",
    "indeed , some of these systems remove all the interior planets from the system , with the giant planets as the only survivors .",
    "several combinations of this type can satisfy the observed tranet multiplicity distribution ( see figure  [ fig : rat5 ] ) .",
    "in essence , the high multiplicity systems derive almost entirely from the unperturbed population , while the single tranet systems consist of a roughly equal split of truly low multiplicity systems drawn from the perturbed population , and high multiplicity systems observed at larger inclination .    the models which feature experiments a3 and a4 are different in that the perturber is a single planet of mass @xmath104 on an inclined orbit .",
    "these are designed to achieve the necessary level of dynamical instability while invoking a perturber of low enough mass to avoid detection by radial velocity methods .",
    "the required inclinations are @xmath356 and so produce substantial obliquities in surviving planets .",
    "the advantage of these composite models is that they require a smaller fraction of stars to host giant planets on large scales .",
    "it has become clear of late that the frequency of low mass planetary systems is higher than that of giant planet systems , and so any model purporting to explain the tranet multiplicities in this way must satisfy the relative frequencies .",
    "the attempt to compare the frequencies of different components requires some assumptions about how to map the models to the observations .",
    "our models for the compact systems assume rocky planets and so are most directly comparable to observed planets with @xmath295 . if we restrict the application of our models to these systems , our discussion in ",
    "[ 2many ] suggests that the frequency of jupiter - mass perturbers required to match the observations is compatible with the estimates based on radial velocity surveys . in this event , we leave an approximately equal - size population of larger planets ( @xmath357 ) unexplained .",
    "this may represent a population with a different origin , perhaps corresponding to the inwards migration posited by some authors ( ida & lin 2010 ; rein 2012 ; mordasini et al .",
    "2012 ; cossou et al .",
    "2014 ) from larger distances .",
    "the larger radii would be consistent with an origin with material containing a larger volatile inventory .    however , there is little evidence to suggest a substantial difference in the period distribution of planets with @xmath295 and those with @xmath357 ( e.g. dong & zhu 2013 ) , and systems exist with planets from both classes ( e.g. carter et al .",
    "2012 ; gautier et al .",
    "we might equally well interpret these as resulting from the same underlying process as the smaller radius cohort , but possibly retaining a small fraction of the mass in a hydrogen envelope .",
    "the radii can be explained by a sufficiently small mass in hydrogen that it need not affect the assembly substantially .    in this event ,",
    "the frequency of systems is about twice as large as before , and requires approximately @xmath358 of stars to possess a planetary component capable of substantially perturbing the interior planetary systems .",
    "this is larger than can reasonably be supported by the radial velocity observations , although it may be consistent if we count all the giant planets , even out to 20  au",
    ". such a scenario could be realised with a relatively dynamic picture of giant planet evolution ",
    "if most giant planets spent some early portion of their lifetime on scales @xmath1905  au , and only later migrated out to more distant locations .",
    "such a picture has indeed been proposed for our own solar system giant planets ( walsh et al .",
    "2011 ) . in this picture",
    "the planets jupiter and saturn migrated inwards to within 2  au ( the precise nature of the migration is still a matter of debate ",
    "brasser et al . 2016 ) , and the configuration of our own terrestrial planets may have been strongly affected by either secular resonance sweeping ( ward 1981 ; agnor & lin 2012 ; brasser , walsh & nesvorny 2013 ) or other effects ( batygin & laughlin 2015 ) . the interaction of saturn and jupiter eventually caused them to migrate outwards and eventually the current configuration was put in place by planetesimal scattering ( tsiganis et al .",
    "the fact that our results show the biggest perturbations result from multiple planet systems may suggest a link to scenarios of this type , although the level of dynamical excitation we invoke may be at odds with the dissipation to be expected from systems migrating in a gaseous disk .",
    "an alternative pathway to finding a sufficiently numerous population of perturbers is to make up the difference between the observed jovian population and the requirements with planets small enough to avoid detection in radial velocity surveys .",
    "we have shown that this is indeed possible , although it requires a dynamically hot population .",
    "encouragingly , there are hints of a substantial population of sub - jovian planets on larger scales in kepler data ( dong & zhu 2013 ; wang et al .",
    "2015 ; uehara et al . 2016 ; foreman - mackey et al . 2016 ) .",
    "such a population of perturbers does leave an imprint in the form of high obliquities for those planets that survive in these systems .",
    "thus , a scenario like this one predicts that single tranets should have a larger fraction of systems with large ( @xmath359 ) obliquities , relative to the high multiplicity systems ( whose obliquities should remain in the single digits ) .",
    "the current state of observation is still somewhat uncertain , with contradictory claims regarding the incidence of high obliquity ( hirano et al .",
    "2014 ; morton & winn 2014 ) .",
    "these results suggest that some or perhaps all of the kste can be the result of dynamical excitation due to secular perturbations from giant planets on scales @xmath10au .",
    "the required frequency of perturbers is potentially consistent with the constraints from both radial velocity studies and searches for single tranet candidates in the kepler database .",
    "it is also possible to match the period distribution with particular choices of perturber systems .",
    "however , we must note that these calculations do not present a complete evolutionary history for these systems , and are best described as a sensitivity study for the robustness of our model for the unperturbed systems under the influence of these external perturbations .",
    "we have assumed that our models from hm13 represent a good representation for the underlying , unperturbed planetary systems .",
    "these are derived from the assumption of in situ assembly , but may also be an acceptable representation of systems derived from other evolutionary pathways because it is only the final secular architecture that matters .",
    "potentially more problematic is if the assembly ( or migration ) takes place in the presence of a pre - existing giant planet system , in which case the giant planets may impose additional regularities not seen here .",
    "thus , the model described here should be considered as one possible representation of the interactions between compact and distant planetary systems and should not be considered an exhaustive exploration of the possibilities .",
    "indeed , other descriptions of these interactions are being actively pursued ( hands & alexander 2016 ; mustill , davies & johansen 2016 ; reid & wyatt 2016 ) .    furthermore , ours is not the only proposal to explain the kste or kepler dichotomy as it is more widely described .",
    "several authors have proposed that variations in the conditions for in situ assembly , either in terms of the surface density profile ( moriarty & ballard 2015 ) or the level of dissipation in the remnant gas disk ( dawson , lee & chiang 2016 ) , could also result in sufficient variation in the tranet properties to match the observations .",
    "other mechanisms for tilting a planetary systems , such as enhanced precession due to the oblateness of young , rapidly rotating stars ( spalding & batygin 2016 ) have also been proposed .",
    "fortunately , as discussed above , there is potentially sufficient ancillary information available ( obliquities , period distributions , companion frequencies ) to eventually tease these scenarios apart .",
    "the substantial diminution of planetary multiplicity seen in many of our simulations may also have relevance to our own solar system . with the discovery of so many short period planets by kepler",
    ", the solar system appears to be quite deficient in terms of planets on small scales , since many star now appear to have multiple planets with periods shorter than that of mercury .",
    "several authors have suggested that perhaps we began with more planets but lost them over time .",
    "batygin & laughlin ( 2015 ) suggest that our original solar system may have contained a population of inner planets that was swept into the star by a population of planetesimals scattered inwards by giant planets , captured by the gas disk and then pulled inwards by drag forces .",
    "alternatively , volk & gladman ( 2015 ) suggest that planetary instability and collision could grind down the planets to dust , leaving mercury as the only remnant .",
    "the results here suggest that secular perturbations can provide a path that combines the best elements of both these scenarios .",
    "figure  [ fig : ssex ] shows an example of one of our simulations from experiment  f3 , in which an initial five planet system is whittled down to a single , @xmath360 planet with a semi - major axis of 0.91  au .",
    "this system is destabilised by inclination pumping , with the four innermost planets being tilted coherently to @xmath361 within 0.4  myr , at which point dynamical instability sets in .",
    "the system undergoes two planet - planet collisions and a planet - star collision in short order , leaving two planets , with the original second innermost on a high eccentricity ( @xmath362 ) orbit , which is eventually driven into the star on longer timescales .",
    "this leaves the original outermost of the five planet system alone in a potentially habitable orbit .",
    "the final configuration bears some relation to the solar system in terms of mass and location , although the final eccentricity is too large ( @xmath119 ) and the orbit is actually retrograde ( @xmath363 )  a consequence of the inclination pumping followed by scattering",
    ". nevertheless , this demonstrates giant planet perturbations can preserve habitable planets while still removing the interior system , as in the batygin & laughlin proposal , but without the need to invoke additional physics associated with coupling of planetesimals to the disk .",
    "the role of stellar collisions is also noteworthy in this regard , as it makes it easier to remove planets entirely , rather than to simply accumulate them into larger systems . in self - excited systems such as those posited by volk & gladman , planetary collisions are dominant and will leave observable remnants unless the collisions are strongly erosive .     and 0.91  au )",
    "but it is not a perfect analogue for the solar system , as the survivor has an eccentricity of @xmath119 and orbits in a retrograde sense .",

    "we see that most of the experiments , even those which substantially reduce the tranet multiplicity ( like a4 and d1 ) , do not produce many systems which have surviving planetary systems whose innermost members lie at @xmath364au .",
    "however , the distributions from experiments  f1 , f2 and f3 do possess a non - negligible fraction that could potentially provide a pathway to forming the solar system terrestrial planets .",
    "the fact that these latter distributions are similar suggests the reason is less a function of the level of dynamical excitation and more the result of having a range of binary separations and hence forcing frequencies .",

    "[ fig : gapss ] ]    finally , we note that our focus here has been on planetary systems orbiting solar - type fgk stars , which dominate the kepler sample . however , ballard & johnson ( 2016 ) have noted that a similar single tranet excess can be found around lower mass stars , suggesting that the phenomenon is ubiquitous .",
    "they suggest that the influence of binary stellar companions may be responsible , but , as we have noted at above , distant companions tend to tilt planetary systems coherently , rather than increasing their intrinsic dispersion . as such",
    ", the similarly of the single tranet excess around m stars suggests that they too possess distant planetary systems in some abundance .",
    "we aim to repeat the set of experiments performed here using the results from hansen ( 2015 ) in a future publication and to compare to estimates of the corresponding populations of perturbers in that case .",
    "we have examined the role of secular forcing on the properties of compact , short - period planetary systems such as those discovered by the kepler satellite and radial velocity monitoring campaigns .",
    "the perturbations are the result of giant planets on scales 15  au , along with possible additional companions on larger scales .",
    "we have investigated the effects of perturbing inclination and eccentricity individually and in combinations consistent with the observed properties of such giant planets .",
    "we find that , if we wish to explain the excess of single tranets observed by kepler , the level of forcing required inevitably leads to a lower multiplicity population of planets , even if we start with a high multiplicity population and perturb only the inclination .",
    "this is a consequence of the amplitude of forcing required , which violates the classical separation of inclination and eccentricity behaviour .",
    "we find that the measured occurrence rates for small planets detected by kepler imply a frequency of perturbers that is consistent with constraints from radial velocity surveys if we restrict our comparison to planets with @xmath295 .",
    "if we apply our model to all planets with @xmath1 then the required frequency of perturbers exceeds observational constraints by a factor of two .",
    "this could still be consistent with the model if a substantial fraction of the perturbers are of sub - saturn mass , and thus missing from radial velocity surveys .",
    "examination of single transit events from kepler lends support to the existence of such a population .",
    "however , it would need to be dynamically hot to provide sufficient amplitude of perturbation to explain the observations , and leaves a robust signature of high obliquities in surviving planets .",
    "a planetary population with such a dynamic history can potentially lead to other observable distinctions .",
    "we have posited that the frequency of late planet collisions amongst the low multiplicity population should imply fewer low bulk density planets amongst the single tranet population , that the frequent occurrence of close star - planet interactions could produce a population of very short period planets and that planetary systems like the inner solar system ( with large inner holes ) can occur in modest proportions ( @xmath366 of all perturbed systems and so in @xmath367 of all cases )",

    "in some of the cases discussed in   [ multiperte ] , there is only one surviving planet left and this experiences a monotonic increase in eccentricity until it hits the star .",
    "the fact that this can occur is not a surprise , if the semi - major axis happens to be at the right location to experience a precession rate resonant with that of the outer planet system .",
    "however , periastra this small result in periastron passages that are comparable to or shorter than the timestep in our original simulations . furthermore , the hybrid symplectic algorithm of chambers ( 1999 ) may not yield a faithful representation of the orbit in such cases .",
    "these lead to us to question whether the planet truly hits the star or should more simply be regarded as remaining in a high eccentricity state unless acted on by tides .    to answer this question we reran these integrations from the point",
    "at which the last planet - planet collision left a single planet interior to 1  au .",
    "we used a shorter timestep and adopted the bulirsch - stoer integrator , which is a more accurate representation for highly eccentric orbits .",
    "the results of one of the examples is shown in figure  [ fig : reson2 ] .",
    "we see that this is indeed the result of a secular pumping because the difference @xmath368 between the longitudes of periastron between the inner planet and the jupiter does not circulate over the course of the integration , resulting in a monotonic rise of the eccentricity to the point of stellar collision .",
    "the fact that the integrator is performing faithfully is supported by the fact that the semi - major axis of the planet does not waver up until the point of stellar collision .",
    "this occurs with non - negligble frequency in cases of eccentricity pumping by a giant planet pair ( 13/50 cases for experiments d1 and d3 , 2/50 for d2 ) . in each case , the last planet standing had a semi - major axis in the range @xmath1190.3  ua and a moderate eccentricity .",
    "this put it into a configuration of secular resonance and resulted in the pumping of the eccentricity to large values .",
    "an additional question of interest is whether this planet really does strike the star , or whether it undergoes roche - lobe overflow .",
    "the fact that the planet eccentricity rises monotonically means that the planet will have an opportunity to exceed the roche limit before it strikes the surface of the star .",
    "if this were to lead to mass loss and halt the rise to high eccentiricity , this might provide a pathway to the production of extremely short period planets .",
    "such planets have indeed been uncovered in the kepler data ( rappaport et al . , 2012 , 2014 ; sanchis - ojeda et al .",
    "2013 , 2015 ; jackson et al . 2013 ) . sanchis - ojeda estimate a frequency @xmath369 ( averaging their results for g and k stars ) per star , which is about 1% of all planet hosting stars ( comparing to the petigura et al . estimate ) . based on our above calculation",
    ", we could produce substantially more of such objects ( @xmath370 of that particular mode ) . of course",
    ", many such objects appear to be evaporating and so may have finite lifetimes , so the survival fraction may be low ."

    "<S> these numbers can be brought into agreement if we posit the existence of an equivalent size population of planets below the rv detection limit ( of characteristic mass @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this population would need to be dynamically hot to produce sufficiently strong perturbations and would leave the imprint of high obliquities amongst the surviving planets . thus , an extensive sample of obliquities for low mass planets can help to indicate the presence of such a population . </S>",
    "<S> the histories of our perturbed populations also produce a significant number of planets that are lost by collision with the star and some that are driven to short orbital periods by the combined action of secular evolution and tidal dissipation . together or separately </S>",
    "<S> these may provide two channels for the formation of ultra - short period planets as have been observed by kepler . </S>",
    "<S> some of our simulations also produce planetary systems with planets that survive in the habitable zone but have no planets interior to them  much as in the case of our solar system . </S>",
