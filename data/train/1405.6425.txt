    "almost twenty years after supermassive black holes were discovered in a few nearby galactic nuclei , it is thought that most galaxies host a smbh with a mass between @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the growth and evolution of the smbh is intertwined with the growth and evolution of its galaxy host , and this is borne out through tight correlations between the smbh mass and fundamental properties of the galaxy such as bulge luminosity  @xcite , dark matter halo mass  @xcite , and stellar velocity dispersion  @xcite .",
    "recent observations probing both the high and low mass end of the galaxy distribution , however , have uncovered examples of embedded smbhs that are orders of magnitude more massive than the correlations predict .",
    "henize 2 - 10 , a dwarf starburst galaxy with @xmath2 smbh @xcite , is nearly 100 times more massive than it should be based on its dynamical mass .",
    "ngc 4486b , a dwarf elliptical , has a @xmath3 smbh comprising 10% of the total galaxy mass  @xcite .",
    "ngc1277 , a compact lenticular galaxy , may host the most massive smbh to date , at @xmath4 ( @xcite , though see @xcite , which advocates for a more modest mass of @xmath5 ) .",
    "current efforts are underway to determine if these represent an extreme class of smbh or if they are statistical outliers .    when the smbh is such a significant contribution to the mass of the galactic nucleus , it should exact a profound change on the shape , structure , and dynamics of its host .",
    "smbhs are known to alter the shape of a triaxial galaxy @xcite , and can stabilize a galaxy against bar formation @xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that smbh feedback can quench star formation ( e.g , @xcite ) , thereby altering the global star formation rate , gas content , and host baryon fraction .",
    "it is not clear , however , how smbh coalescence proceeds in this extreme case .",
    "typically , a galaxy merger is expected to be followed eventually by a binary black hole merger deep within the core of the merger . in this framework",
    ", smbh separation is governed on kiloparsec scales by dynamical friction , until the pair joins and forms a hard binary .",
    "the separation on the parsec scale is dictated by 3-body scattering of stars within the binary s loss cone .",
    "once the ejected stars have extracted enough energy from the binary orbit to shrink the separation to roughly milli - parsec scales , gravitational radiation dominates , and the smbhs coalesce  @xcite .",
    "naively , the orbit of an ultramassive binary smbh should stall at the parsec scale , since it would need to eject roughly its own mass in stars to reach the gravitational wave stage , and in some cases that could be over half the bulge mass .",
    "indeed , this _ final parsec problem _ is known to be especially problematic for massive black holes ( @xmath6 ) and high mass ratios  @xcite ; this may imply that these ultramassive black holes are unlikely to coalesce .    in this paper",
    ", we simulate the dynamics of an ultramassive black hole during a galaxy merger using direct @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "we find that the merger remnant is quite axisymmetric well within the smbh influence radius , but it remains triaxial farther out .",
    "contrary to expectations , the black holes reach the gravitational wave regime very efficiently .",
    "surprisingly , the separation between the binary smbh is mainly driven by dynamical friction ; the 3-body scattering phase is very brief , if it exists at all . by the time the binary is hard ,",
    "gravitational radiation is already copious , and the black holes coalesce quickly after .",
    "we discuss out experimental setup in section[gal - set ] , the results , including post - newtonian effects in sections [ str ] & [ results ] , and we discuss the implications in section [ sum ] .",
    "we launch two equal - mass , smbh - embedded , gas - free , equilibrium , spherical and isotropic galaxy models on a merger orbit to study how ultramassive black holes affect smbh binary formation and evolution within a realistic live merger remnant . here",
    ", each model represents an elliptical galaxy nucleus , one either embedded with an especially massive black hole , or one hosting a smbh on the @xmath7 relation . to ensure",
    "that the binary black hole evolution is well - resolved , we zoom - in on the late stages of an equal mass galaxy merger ; the simulation starts when the nuclei are only separated by 750 parsec .",
    "the nuclei are set on an initial eccentric orbit of 0.76 , consistent with typical merger eccentricities  @xcite . at first pericenter ,",
    "the smbh separation is a mere 100 parsecs .",
    "we represent the stellar density distribution in each nucleus by a  @xcite profile :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the total stellar mass in the galaxy , @xmath10 is its scale radius , and @xmath11 is logarithmic slope of the central density profile .",
    "increasing @xmath11 concentrates more stellar mass in the center . we construct the model with a central point mass to represent the smbh and our stellar velocity distribution is chosen from the equilibrium distribution function of this black hole - embedded model @xcite .",
    "we create three models to represent the primary galaxy , each of which host an extremely massive black hole .",
    "two of our primary models host a smbh with @xmath12  we identify this model as the ultramassive case .",
    "the key difference between the two ultramassive models is @xmath11 , which we vary between 1.0 and 1.5 .",
    "our final primary galaxy model contains a central smbh with @xmath13 , which we denote as the overmassive model ; this mass is chosen to be consistent with conservative estimates of the smbh mass in brightest cluster galaxies @xcite .",
    "two additional models represent the secondary ; each model has a @xmath14 slope , but different smbhs that bracket the range of possible masses on the @xmath15-@xmath16 relation  @xcite .",
    "the galaxy parameters are described in table [ tablea ] .",
    "the total stellar mass of each model , @xmath17 and @xmath10 are all set to 1.0 .",
    ".initial galaxy models [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tableb ]      we carry out @xmath0-body integrations using @xmath18-grape+gpu , an updated version of @xmath18-grape @xcite , described in section 2.2 of @xcite . for the current study , we employ a softening of @xmath19 for star - star interactions and 0 for smbh - smbh interactions .",
    "the simulations were run on 8 nodes ( each containing 4 graphic processing units ( gpu ) cards ) on _ accre _ , a high performance gpu cluster at vanderbilt university .",
    "figure  [ evol ] shows the cumulative mass profile of the merger remnants .",
    "run1 and run2 have similar mass profiles ; only the secondary smbh differs . for run3",
    ", the steep density cusp is conserved in the remnant , consistent with the interpretation that the three - body scattering phase has not played an active role in sculpting the remnant despite the fact that , as we shall see below , the smbhs coalesce . with so few 3-body scattering events to scour a core , the most massive smbh class could reside in cuspy galactic nuclei .",
    "we analyzed the shape evolution of the merger remnant by calculating axes ratios both well inside @xmath20 and at @xmath21 .",
    "figure [ evol ] shows the morphological evolution in run3 ; near the center , the system is initially triaxial , but as it evolves , the triaxiality decreases , and we are left with a moderately flattened axisymmetric central region .",
    "however the situation is different at @xmath20 where the system remains stably triaxial .",
    "this behavior is consistent with equilibrium studies of smbh - embedded triaxial galaxies @xcite , where the smbh induces chaos in the centrophilic orbit population inside @xmath20 , a situation that may well be amplified by the 3-body scattering of the smbh binary .",
    "here we discuss the formation and evolution of the smbh binaries in each galaxy merger simulation .",
    "figure  [ evol1 ] shows the binary parameter evolution .",
    "we display physical units by scaling the primary to ngc1277 to get a clearer picture of physical domains and time scales involved . to focus on resolving the dynamics of the smbhs within the remnant",
    ", the simulation begins assuming the merger is well underway , and the secondary galactic nucleus has already sunk to the inner kpc of the primary . as a result , the galaxy merger is complete in only a few myr ; at this time , the density cusp of each galaxy is indistinguishable in phase space . during this rapid merger phase , the two smbhs form a binary within the center separated by @xmath22 parsec .",
    "the red line ( figure [ evol1 ] , top ) shows the evolution of smbh separation in run1 . here , the primary has a @xmath14 profile and the secondary has a central smbh mass of 0.001 .",
    "as expected , dynamical friction governs the early inspiral of the secondary smbh .",
    "initially the inspiral is slow because the background stellar density is low , but as the smbh moves further in toward the scale radius at 50 pc , the plunge accelerates .",
    "the middle panel of this figure shows how the inverse semi - major axis of the binary evolves with time , or the hardening timescale .",
    "it is easy to see this initial slow inspiral on the diffuse outskirts of the galactic nucleus .",
    "note that the noise in 1/a is caused by the primary stellar cusp , and reduces as smbh decouples from the global stellar background and binds to the primary smbh .    by 35 myr ,",
    "the smbhs are separated by only 2 pc and the hardening rate slows down , hinting a transition from the dynamical friction phase to three - body scattering phase .",
    "the dynamical friction time we observe in the simulation is consistent with the predicted dynamical friction decay time for a smbh in a smbh - embedded hernquist ( @xmath14 ) cusp  @xcite . in the dynamical friction phase",
    ", the eccentricity ( bottom panel of figure ) circularizes , reaching an eccentricity @xmath23 , but once the three - body scattering phase begins to dominate , the eccentricity increases very rapidly , reaching @xmath24 at the end of the simulation at 50 myr .      for this run , the secondary smbh is intended to represent the upper envelope of the @xmath15-@xmath16 relation and is therefore five times more massive than in run1 .",
    "we expect the smbh separation to shrink roughly five times faster in the dynamical friction phase , since the background remains same .",
    "figure [ evol1 ] bears this out ; indeed this large smbh sinks to 1 pc in about 10 myr ( magenta)approximately five times faster than run1 .",
    "the inverse semi - major axis evolves quickly until the separation is a parsec and then evolves more slowly , indicating a transition from dynamical friction to three - body scattering .",
    "again we see a very rapid increase in eccentricity from below 0.1 to nearly 0.8 when we halt the simulation at 20 myr because gravitational wave emission dominates the evolution .      here",
    "our primary galaxy mass model is more concentrated , with a @xmath25 cusp .",
    "this more concentrated model is a better analog to compact ellipticals like ngc 1277  @xcite .",
    "the binary black hole evolution is shown by the blue line in figure [ evol1 ] .",
    "the initial secondary smbh inspiral is slower than that in run2 due to the lower stellar density in the galaxy outskirts . once the second smbh enters the primary scale radius ( @xmath26 pc )",
    ", however , the inspiral rate outpaces run2 , and the smbh separation shrinks below 1 parsec in less than 10 myr . this rapid evolution is also reflected in the short hardening timescale of the smbh binary  a mere 2 myr three - body scattering phase ushers the smbh binary into the gravitational wave regime . like the previous two runs , the smbh binary eccentricity dramatically increases during the 3-body scattering phase .",
    "since there is some debate on the masses of this extreme smbh class , we use run4 to explore a more conservative primary black hole mass ; at @xmath13 , this smbh is still a distinct outlier on the black hole - bulge mass relation , but is a factor of 3 smaller than in the ultramassive models .",
    "dynamical friction efficiently shrinks the separation between the two smbhs down to a parsec . from table",
    "[ tableb ] , we can see that estimated dynamical friction time and observed decay time match very well .",
    "like all previous cases eccentricity increases rapidly at the junction of dynamical friction and three - body scattering phase .",
    "the closest comparison is with run2 ; however , the inspiral time is shorter in this case because the satellite suffers less mass loss , thereby behaving as massive ` particle ' that experiences stronger dynamical friction .",
    "the binary forms and hardens at a larger separation .",
    "the three - body scattering phase is prolonged compared to run2 , and the coalescence happens after 50 myr , roughly twice run2 .",
    "the smbh binary eccentricity quickly rises in each run , marking when the inspiraling smbh delves deep enough into core that it encloses a stellar mass roughly equivalent to its own mass .",
    "this trend was noticed by @xcite , and though it marked the transition between dynamical friction and hard binary evolution , the reason was not clear .",
    "we can calculate the subsequent smbh binary evolution with reasonable confidence by following the scheme adopted in @xcite to model the binary in the post - newtonian regime .",
    "this , plus the @xmath0-body evolution allows us to estimate the total smbh binary coalescence time .",
    "we determine the average hardening rate @xmath27 during the last few myr of our simulations , and assume that this rate remains constant until the gravitational wave regime .",
    "we also take the final eccentricity @xmath28 to be constant .",
    "smbh binary evolution can then be estimated as :    @xmath29    for gravitational wave hardening , we use the orbit - averaged expression from @xcite    @xmath30    we solve these coupled equations numerically to calculate the smbh binary evolution .",
    "estimates of 1/a are shown in figure [ sem2a ] .",
    "the smbh binaries in run2 and run3 are already in the gravitational wave - dominated regime at the end of our direct @xmath31body runs .",
    "the total coalescence times , starting from 750 pc when each black hole is embedded in a separate galactic nucleus , are both remarkably small  23 myr and 12 myr , respectively . for run4 which has a less massive primary smbh by a factor of 3 , the coalescence is 60 myr .",
    "three - body scattering phase is prolonged compared to run2 , and the coalescence takes place after 50 myr , roughly twice that of run2 .",
    "it appears that when an extreme smbh is involved in an interaction , the coalescence proceeds quickly and is mediated predominantly by dynamical friction . for comparison",
    ", we include the results of our earlier merger study from @xcite where each smbh is on the @xmath15-@xmath16 relation ( run a4 ) .",
    "this run was scaled to m87 with a @xmath32 smbh .",
    "we see a long - term 3-body hardening phase , resulting in a coalescence time that is 20 - 30 times larger than what we witness in this study .",
    "we performed direct @xmath0-body simulations of the merger of two smbh - embedded galactic nuclei , in which the primary hosts an extremely massive smbh .",
    "the overall goal was to investigate how these smbhs affect the structure of the merger remnant , as well as the formation and evolution of the smbh binary . though we choose the particular scaling of the primary smbh to be analogous to the range of estimates for ngc1277 , the results are generic for this most massive smbh class .",
    "we followed the late stages of the merger , from kiloparsec separations , through the formation of a bound smbh binary , to a hard smbh binary with a separation of less than a parsec .",
    "we have two models for the ngc1277 bulge to represent both shallow and cuspier density profiles .",
    "we found that the two nuclei merge in a span of few myrs and a smbh binary forms with separation of @xmath33 pc .",
    "dynamical friction is efficient in driving smbh binary separation below a parsec .",
    "the sinking timescale is more rapid when the secondary smbh is more massive , or when the primary density profile is higher , since dynamical friction scales with the infalling mass and the stellar background density . with such large binary separations",
    ", this class could represent an excellent prospect for the electromagnetic detection of smbh binaries , though the lifetime in this phase may preclude direct detection . while at these large separations , gravitational wave emission is already significant ; this will likely boost the smbh binary signal expected by pulsar timing @xcite .",
    "this dynamical friction phase ends when the inspiralling smbh sinks deep enough into the center that the enclosed stellar mass is comparable to its own mass . in cases where the secondary smbh is 0.5 percent of its host bulge mass ,",
    "dynamical friction is highly efficient , ushering this smbh so close to the overmassive smbh that gravitational waves dominate . in these cases ,",
    "the binary bypasses the 3-body scattering phase seen in typical smbh binaries .",
    "we expect far fewer hypervelocity stars as a result , and far less significant scouring of the central density profile ; indeed , flattened density cusps may not be indicative of this most massive smbh class . when the inspiralling smbh is 0.1% its host mass , there is a brief period of 3-body scattering before the binary enters the gravitational wave - dominated regime .",
    "we notice a sudden increase in binary eccentricity at the end of dynamical friction phase .",
    "the merger of two galactic nuclei results in an initially triaxial structure throughout . within a dynamical time",
    ", the binary smbh induces chaos in the centrophilic orbits that define the long axis of the triaxial potential , and with these orbits scattered ergodically , a more axisymmetric figure remains . at smbh influence radius ,",
    "the merger product is still triaxial as is expected from previous studies .",
    "estimated coalescence times of @xmath34 myr are remarkably short compared to all other collisionless studies involving typical smbh masses . there , the coalescence times are @xmath350.5 - 3gyr @xcite .",
    "overall , these rapid coalescence times may aid in pinning a future detection of a gravitational wave coalescence to a particular galaxy by requiring that the host is a recent merger remnant .",
    "for this most massive smbh class , we predict that the black hole merger rate would closely track the host galaxy merger rate , with no significant lag time , and no final parsec problem .",
    "the authors wish to thank the kavli institute of theoretical physics for hosting an excellent smbh program , during which much of this paper was hashed out .",
