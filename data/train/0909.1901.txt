    "in ecology , a striking observation is that variability in population abundance of a species and average population density are related in both space and time .",
    "the relationship is known as the taylor s power law ( or the law of the mean ) and states that the mean @xmath0 and the variance @xmath1 characterizing the number of population representatives are related by the power law @xmath2 with the characteristic exponent @xmath3 describing effects of heterogeneity in spatial or temporal patterns of the frequency distribution .    since the publication of taylor s famous paper in 1961 @xcite , the law of the mean has been substantiated in a vast body of ecological data that spans from protozooans to human populations @xcite .",
    "this kind of fluctuation scaling has been also noticed in a variety of natural phenomena including precipitation in a given area and river flows @xcite .",
    "taylor s law has also been observed in dynamics of different man - made systems driven by human activity @xcite .",
    "here , the list of documented examples includes behavior of the internet and stock market dynamics .    in this paper",
    "we perform a detailed analysis of fluctuation scaling in car traffic .",
    "we show that fluctuations in the number of cars passing through a given observation point fulfil the relationship given by eq .",
    "( [ taylor ] ) .",
    "the clue observation reported in this paper is that the scaling exponent @xmath3 does not unequivocally characterize a given road network .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 may differ not only among various transportation networks but also within the same network if one takes into account : location of observation points ( intersection , one - way street , highway , etc . ) , season , period of day , or simply traffic intensity .",
    "for this reason taylor s law may serve , beside the fundamental diagram , as an indicator of different traffic phases ( free flow , traffic jam etc . ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : at the beginning ( section  [ secreal ] ) we analyze taylor s fluctuation scaling in real data . in section  [ secnasch ]",
    "we show that taylor s law is also observed in the simplest cellular automaton model for traffic ( the nagel - schreckenberg model ) , although interpretation of the obtained results deserves further studies .",
    "section  [ secsum ] gives concluding remarks .",
    "hourly numbers of cars passing through observation points located on interstates , trunk highways , county state - aid highways , and municipal state - aid streets at various locations throughout minnesota were retrieved from the minnesota department of transportation @xcite .",
    "the traffic intensity had been recorded by 72 automatic traffic recorders ( atrs ) from 2002 to 2007 .",
    "the datasets , from which mean and variance were calculated , include the number of cars observed by a single recorder and passing in only one direction at a given hour in all weekdays of a month ( consult figure  [ series ] for better understanding ) .    in figure",
    "[ real ] , one can see that although the whole data obey taylor s fluctuation scaling with the characteristic exponent @xmath4 , in reality , the data are very heterogeneous and the parameter @xmath3 characterizing traffic recorded by a single atr may change dramatically from hour to hour .",
    "for example , the car flow ( i.e. the number of cars counted within a given time window ) as measured by atr no .",
    "222 possesses three distinct phases corresponding to non - overlapping periods of time by day , i.e. night hours : 1am-7am , working hours : 8am-6pm , evening : 7pm-12am .",
    "the phases have different values of the characteristic parameter @xmath3 .",
    "it is meaningful that during night hours the value of @xmath5 is very close to unity , corresponds to poissonian fluctuations @xmath6 , cf .",
    "( [ taylor ] ) . ] which suggest motion of independent ( uncorrelated ) cars . during working hours traffic",
    "is characterized by the largest value of @xmath7 . in this period , due to mutual interactions",
    "( correlations ) between cars , fluctuations in traffic flow are significant and congestion ( traffic jam ) can be observed .",
    "our results clearly show that in the evening , nature of traffic recorded by the considered atr changes again . the value of @xmath8 attributing the new phase is lower than the corresponding value characterizing the earlier period .",
    "it implies that in the evening traffic becomes more homogeneous in comparison with working hours .",
    "our results show that the characteristic exponent @xmath3 in taylor s power law for fluctuation may be used to characterize different phases of traffic flow .",
    "larger values of the parameter characterize stronger collective phenomena manifesting themselves in congestion effects .",
    "has been also found in other complex systems . in ecology ,",
    "larger values of @xmath3 give evidence for stronger aggregation of individuals in different populations  @xcite .",
    "in genetics , they characterize stronger clustering of genes in chromosomes @xcite .",
    "] we also show that taylor s law characterizing various complex systems may comprise of several laws with different characteristic exponents .",
    "doing such a decomposition one can better understand the considered systems .",
    "during the last 20 years , a number of cellular automaton models have been proposed in order to better understand complex traffic phenomena and reproduce the empirical data , such as the spontaneous formation of jams @xcite .",
    "a particularly simple , pioneering model for single - lane traffic has been proposed by nagel and schreckenberg in 1992 @xcite .",
    "further in the paper we show that the model , called the nasch model , is characterized by taylor s fluctuation scaling with non - trivial values of the characteristic exponent @xmath3 .    in the nasch model a lane",
    "is represented by a one - dimensional array of @xmath9 sites .",
    "each site may either be occupied by one of @xmath10 cars , or it may be empty ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "each vehicle @xmath12 has an integer velocity @xmath13 with values between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "state of the system at time @xmath16 is obtained from its state at time @xmath17 by applying the following rules to all cars at the same time :    1 .   _ acceleration : _ unless velocity @xmath13 of a car is lower than @xmath15 it is advanced by one @xmath18.\\ ] ] 2 .",
    "_ slowing down ( due to other cars ) : _ if the distance @xmath19 to the next car ahead is not larger than @xmath13 the speed is reduced to avoid accidents @xmath20.\\ ] ] 3 .   _",
    "randomization : _ with probability @xmath21 the velocity of a car ( if greater than zero ) is decreased by one @xmath22 4 .   _ car motion ( update of positions ) : _ each car is advanced @xmath13 sites .",
    "numerical simulations of the model have been performed on one - dimensional lattice of size @xmath23 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "each simulation has started at random initial conditions , i.e. random localization of @xmath10 cars on a lane ( further in the text we rather use the parameter @xmath24 than @xmath10 ) and random initial velocities .",
    "then , we have updated state of the system in accordance with the rules described above . collection of data has started after the first @xmath9 time steps .      in our analysis",
    "we have concentrated on time series whose data points represent the number of cars passing through arbitrary lattice site in a given time period @xmath25 ( cf .",
    "figure  [ series ] ) .",
    "having such a time series one can calculate its mean and variance ( both depending on @xmath25 ) .",
    "doing so for different window sizes @xmath26 and plotting the obtained mean - variance points in a log - log graph we have obtained taylor s power laws characterizing various stages of the traffic flow described by the set of model parameters @xmath15 , @xmath21 and @xmath27 . in figure  [ nascht ]",
    "we have shown three scaling laws describing car motion in the nasch model with @xmath28 , @xmath29 and different values of the car density @xmath27 .    in figure  [ naschb]a and b",
    "one can see how the scaling parameter @xmath3 characterizing fluctuations in the considered model depends on the car density @xmath27 for two given values of the speed limit @xmath30 and @xmath31 and the fixed probability of slowing down @xmath29 .",
    "our simulations show that in the vicinity of the transition from the laminar traffic flow to the congested phase , it means in the vicinity of the maximum in the fundamental diagram ( see figure  [ naschb]c and d ) , values of the parameter @xmath3 are significantly larger than outside the region .",
    "it means that the transition is turbulent .",
    "it is accompanied by large fluctuations , just like in continuous phase transitions .",
    "the sudden reduction of the scaling exponent @xmath3 exactly at the critical density ( dashed lines in the considered figure ) is due to finite size effects , which cause that in the vicinity of the transition point traffic becomes locally regular .",
    "the result are consistent with our previous observations obtained for real traffic , according to which below the transition point the growing density of cars causes higher values of @xmath3 . these in turn show evidence of strongly inhomogeneous , turbulent traffic .",
    "a short summary of the paper has been given in the introduction ( section  [ intro ] ) , therefore we avoid it here .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to draw the readers attention to issues related to the origin of the taylor s law for fluctuation scaling .",
    "at present , universality of the law is widely recognized .",
    "the list of scientific disciplines in which taylor s fluctuation scaling has been observed encompasses : genetics , epidemiology , medicine , physics , economy , computer and social sciences .",
    "it allows one to think , that there must exist a common mechanism underlying this law . in our recent paper @xcite",
    "we show that the conjecture is justified . in the paper , for the first time",
    "we give a universal , microscopic explanation of the law .",
    "supported by real world observations ranging from insect and bird populations , through the human chromosome to traffic intensity in transportation network , we show that the law results from the density of state function characterizing the considered systems ( the concept borrowed from statistical physics ) .",
