    "silicon carbide is well - known for its huge number of crystal modifications , all of them breaking inversion symmetry .",
    "some publications consider more than 200 of them with either cubic (  c  ) , hexagonal (  h  ) , or rombohedral (  r  ) symmetry of the unit cell , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "they are usually referred to as @xmath0c - sic , @xmath0h - sic , and @xmath0r - sic , respectively .",
    "the variable @xmath0 gives the number of si ",
    "c bilayers consisting of a c and a si layer stacking in the unit cell .",
    "further information and sketches of the unit cells of 3c - sic and 6h - sic can be found in ref.@xcite ( see fig.1 and table1 therein ) . in 2007 ,",
    "superconductivity was found in silicon carbide upon heavy boron - doping ( sic : b ) at boron concentrations of about @xmath1@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature @xmath3  in zero field is about 1.45k and the upper critical field strength @xmath4oe @xcite .",
    "moreover , a strong supercooling effect indicated by a large hysteresis in temperature- ( field- ) dependent ac susceptibility measurements upon decreasing and increasing temperature ( field down and up sweep ) in finite magnetic dc fields was observed .",
    "this led to the conclusion that sic : b is a type - i superconductor .",
    "an estimate of the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) parameter @xmath5  from the charge - carrier concentration , the sommerfeld parameter of the normal - state specific heat , and the critical temperature yielded @xmath6 @xcite in agreement with the type - i superconductivity in this system which needs @xmath7 .",
    "the next step was to prepare sic crystals with dopants other than boron .",
    "recently , aluminum doping was found to induce superconductivity in 3c - sic ( sic : al ) at a charge - carrier concentration of about @xmath8@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "suprisingly , the zero - field critical temperature remains almost unchanged 1.5k .    in this paper ,",
    "an ac susceptibility study on sic : al is presented .",
    "the preparation of the aluminium - doped sic samples was done in a similar way as for sic : b , see @xcite . the sample used is a polycrystalline sample and not single phase consisting mainly of 3c - sic and unreacted al and si phase fractions . an analysis of powder x - ray diffraction measurements suggests that al substitutes at the si site in sic . in resistivity data , a sharp transition into a superconducting ground state at @xmath9k",

    "the system features a metallic - like temperature dependence with a positive slope of d@xmath12d@xmath13 in the whole temperature range up to room temperature and a residual resistivity ratio @xmath14 of about 5 . in temperature - dependent resistivity measurements at constant dc magnetic fields as well as field - dependent measurements at constant temperatures , no indication for a supercooling behavior",
    "was found in contrast to sic : b leading to the conclusion that the superconductivity in sic : al is of type - ii rather than type - i .",
    "ac susceptibility measurements were performed using a mutual - inductance method in a commercial @xmath15he refrigerator ( oxford instruments , heliox ) inserted into a standard superconducting magnet .",
    "a small ac field of @xmath16oe - rms at a frequency of 3011hz was used in zero and several finite dc magnetic fields @xmath17  parallel to @xmath18  as well as at constant temperatures upon sweeping the external field .     of sic : al .",

    "the temperature dependence of the in - field susceptibility data was taken as follows : the external dc magnetic field @xmath17  was set above @xmath3 .",
    "then the temperature was reduced down to approx .",
    "300mk and subsequently increased above @xmath3 .",
    "panels ( c ) ( @xmath22 ) and ( d ) ( @xmath23 ) show field - dependent data taken after the sample was zero - field cooled to @xmath24mk .",

    "in contrast to the resistivity data reported in ref.@xcite , the ac susceptibility data reveals a hysteresis at higher dc magnetic fields albeit this effect is rather tiny",
    ". the hysteresis increases with increasing the external field strength / lowering the temperature as indicated by the difference between the corresponding solid ( cooling ) and dashed ( subsequent warming run ) lines in figs.[ac1_si5c4al03](a ) and ( b ) or between the respective lines ( dashed @xmath25 field sweep up , solid @xmath25 field sweep down ) in figs.[ac1_si5c4al03](c ) and ( d ) .",

    "the authors discuss the superconductivity in boron - doped diamond c : b and boron- and aluminum - doped sic .",
    "they propose a phase diagram depending on the origin of the superconductivity , i.e. , whether it emerges from host bands or from impurity bands , arguing that the type - ii superconductor c : b is in the crossover region between host - band and impurity - band superconductivity , whereas type - i sic : b is clearly allocated in the host - band regime .",
    "then type - ii sic : al would be closer to c : b in their phase diagram than to sic : b .",
    "such allocations originate from the difference in the doping site , i.e. , the c site in case of boron and the si site in case of aluminum doping .",
    "however , the observation of a fairly small difference between subsequent cooling ( field down ) and warming runs ( field up sweeps ) at higher magnetic fields / low temperatures can also be explained as follows . assuming that pure single - phase sic : al is a type - i superconductor , this ",
    "clean feature could be  hidden away  by the disorder of the multiphase sample used and hence sic : al appears as a  dirty  type - ii superconductor .",
    "this could lead to a sufficient suppression of supercooling in sic : al , see refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the present ac susceptibility study is complementary to the resistivity and dc magnetization study on aluminum - doped silicon carbide in ref.@xcite .",
    "the high sensitivity of the ac susceptibility at the onset of a superconducting transition reveals a rather tiny difference in the onset temperatures of superconductivity upon cooling and warming in higher external magnetic fields .",
    "this hysteresis is attributable to supercooling .",
    "one may speculate that a  clean ",
    "single crystalline sample sic : al would exhibit a larger hysteresis .",
