    "impurity scattering plays a dominant role in the transport and thermodynamic properties of unconventional superconductors , far larger than in conventional s - wave superconductors .",
    "this is a consequence of the gap nodes which prevent the complete freezing out of scattering processes , and the fact that an anisotropic order parameter is far more sensitive to disorder .",
    "the critical temperature for an anisotropic superconductor is suppressed even in lowest order by the disorder potential .",
    "this follows from the breakdown of one of the conditions for anderson s theorem @xcite , which is that the momentum dependence of the pair potential is weak .",
    "a breakdown of the theorem leads to bound states in the gap when there are magnetic impurities in s - wave materials .",
    "it also leads to the possibility of such bound states from nonmagnetic impurities in the gap of an unconventional superconductor .",
    "this paper is devoted to questions about these states : their energy levels , their wavefunctions , their lifetimes , and the role ( if any ) they play in observable properties at low temperatures",
    ".    this subject is topical because of the interest in high - temperature superconductors .",
    "some of these systems appear to have gap nodes , implying the presence of an unconventional order parameter .",
    "no picture of these materials is complete without understanding the effects of dirt .",
    "furthermore , experiments in the asymptotic low - temperature regime are special in that they probe the region of the fermi surface near the nodes .",
    "it is in this region where the effects of impurities are most dramatic .",
    "the same considerations hold for the comparatively venerable heavy - fermion superconductors . here",
    "we have solid grounds for supposing that some of these systems , particularly upt@xmath1 and ube@xmath2 , are unconventional .",
    "still , after more than a decade of investigation , the experimental details of the thermodynamic and transport properties of these systems at low temperatures are not fully reconciled with theory . in heavy fermion materials , however , it has become clear that strong impurity scattering , approaching the unitary limit , is the rule , not the exception .",
    "the born approximation is inadequate . in high - t@xmath3 systems , this is still under debate . in this paper",
    ", i will concentrate on this near - unitary limit .",
    "the literature on impurity states in the superconducting gap begins with the papers of yu @xcite and shiba @xcite on magnetic impurities in s - wave systems .",
    "the two important ingredients are the pairbreaking nature of the disorder potential and the hard energy gap - the density of states ( dos ) is zero in some neighborhood of the chemical potential in the pure system .",
    "bound states appear in the gap .",
    "increasing the impurity concentration increases the number of bound states and decreases the gap , leading first to the gapless state and finally to the destruction of superconductivity @xcite .    in unconventional superconductors ,",
    "the bound states arising from ordinary potential scattering were first considered by buchholtz and zwicknagl @xcite .",
    "they concentrated on the balian - werthamer state , which has a hard energy gap , but the momentum - averaged gap vanishes : @xmath4 , where the sum is over the fermi surface .",
    "for such a gap , the results are somewhat similar to the previous case as the disorder potential is likewise pairbreaking . although time - reversal symmetry is not broken , the randomization of momentum in the eigenstates prevents pairing by a momentum - dependent potential .",
    "bound states appear in the gap .",
    "these authors also state that , in the unitarity limit of very strong potentials on the impurities , the bound states are at midgap .",
    "this statement has been repeated many times in the literature .",
    "however , i will argue below that it is incorrect .",
    "one important point about unconventional superconductors is that they can not exist at very high impurity density .",
    "the critical temperature decreases as the impurity concentration is increased , and vanishes when @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the critical temperature in the absence of scattering .",
    "this implies that the regime of low impurity density is the only one of interest .    with the discovery in the 1980 s of the heavy fermion superconductors ,",
    "there was an explosion of interest in the problem of disorder in unconventional superconductors .",
    "many calculations of transport and thermodynamic properties at low temperatures have been published @xcite .",
    "the standard method , explained most completely by hirschfeld _",
    "@xcite , combines the t - matrix approximation with standard impurity averaging techniques . generally speaking , scattering near or at the unitarity limit",
    "is required to explain experiments in both the heavy - fermion @xcite , @xcite and perhaps also in the high - t@xmath3 materials @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this suggestion that the unitary limit is the appropriate one for kondo lattice systems is due to pethick and pines @xcite .",
    "while this model is certainly relevant to the weakly hybridizing @xmath7-level electrons in heavy fermion materials , its applicability to high - t@xmath3 systems is unclear .",
    "the superconducting order parameters considered for both kinds of systems do satisfy the @xmath4 condition , but they do not have a hard energy gap .",
    "the dos of the pure system is usually taken to vanish linearly or quadratically at the chemical potential @xmath8 .",
    "the standard method of treating the disorder potential leads to a finite dos at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the neighborhood of the chemical potential where the density of states is flat is sometimes referred to as the impurity band @xcite .",
    "the impurity averaging method for unconventional superconductors has been explicitly questioned by some recent work @xcite .",
    "the gap nodes lead to unusual wavefunctions for the bound states , with the possibility of anomalous overlaps between well - separated impurities . in compensated doped semiconductors , a high concentration of impurities can lead to a new conduction mechanism which predominates at low temperatures , conduction entirely through the impurity wavefunctions which form the impurity band @xcite . this possibility must be considered also in superconductors .",
    "the electrical conductivity of any such band would of course be shorted out by the conductivity of the condensate , but the opposite could well occur for the thermal conductivity .",
    "i will argue below that this does _ not _ occur .",
    "a more radical criticism of impurity averaging for two - dimensional sysyems is contained in papers of neresyan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who find that multisite processes restore the vanishing of the dos at the chemical potential .",
    "a recent preprint of ziegler _ et al . _",
    "@xcite shows that , for lorentzian disorder , the finite dos is not a consequence of impurity averaging .    while the aim of the current work is to clarify the theoretical situation for nonmagnetic impurities in unconventional superconductors ,",
    "there has been considerable recent work on magnetic impurities in both conventional and unconventional superconductors , stimulated by experiments @xcite .",
    "some of this work has reached conclusions similar to those presented here , particularly with regard to the importance of carefully considering the real part of the green s function in t - matrix calculations @xcite , @xcite .    in order to build up the theory from the start ,",

    "[ sec : semi ] with the question of bound states in the normal state of a semiconductor with a gap , in the limit of strong scattering .",

    "[ sec : swave ] , both to establish notation and to get a basis of comparison with unconventional superconductivity .",

    "i examine an imaginary semiconductor in this section . the goal is to understand the process of binding an electron to an impurity with a very strong short - range potential .",
    "the physics of this process is sufficiently different from the textbook cases that certain features are likely to be as unfamiliar to the reader as they were to the writer .",
    "these features are important for the superconducting model which is believed to be of most relevance for high - t@xmath3 and heavy fermion superconductors .",
    "let us consider a semiconductor with a single impurity .",
    "the gap is the result of the lattice potential , a single - particle effect , and is not tied to the chemical potential , which lies in the gap . in the limit of weak scattering , this is essentially the familiar case of off - valence impurities in a group iv material .",
    "this leads to impurity states very near the band edges .",

    "we may write @xmath32 where @xmath33 the integral for @xmath34 always converges because @xmath35 for a true bound state .",
    "therefore we find @xmath36 in the neighborhood of the pole .",
    "the bound states are therefore characterized by poles in the t - matrix , and resonances by a sharp peak in the imaginary part of the t - matrix .",
    "the t - matrix gives the exact solution for the one impurity problem .",

    "we find @xmath72 the bound state energy is : @xmath73 this is a state just below the upper band .",
    "the lower band has no effect in this case .",
    "it is important to note that the exponential dependence for the bound state energy is due to the fact that there is a finite jump in the density of states at the band edge . if there is a square root singularity : @xmath74 for @xmath75 , as one would expect in three dimensions , then there is a threshold coupling strength below which there is no bound state .",
    "the hydrogenic impurity case , of great practical importance , is different from all of these cases because of the long - range potential , which leads to an infinite number of bound states for all interaction strengths even in three dimensions .",

    "the bound state energy is displaced away from the band with the higher density of states because of level repulsion .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the wavefunction ( the radius of the bound state ) is still determined by the distance to the nearest band edge and the effective mass of that band .",
    "the effect of the asymmetry may be described as a renormalization of the potential in the following way .",
    "we may rewrite the eigenvalue equation as : @xmath89 if we define the renormalized potential strength as @xmath90 this equation defines the asymmetry factor @xmath91 , @xmath92 which is of the same order of magnitude as the density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "it is @xmath93 not @xmath94 , that determines the energy of the bound state .",
    "it is important to note that , as @xmath95 , @xmath96 if the upper band is dominant , @xmath97 , and the potential is repulsive , @xmath48 , then we have that @xmath98 and the antibound state always stays below the center of the gap .",
    "this is simply a consequence of level repulsion .",

    "no conclusion which is based on such an extension is likely to apply to any real material .      in a semiconductor ,",
    "the occupation of impurity levels is normally strongly dependent on the valence of the impurity relative to the valence of the constituent atoms . here",
    ", we have been using a model in which the valence of the impurity and the background atoms is the same .",
    "we explicitly do not introduce additional states , only a potential which moves the old states around .",
    "this distinguishes the present work from anderson magnetic impurity models , which generally do introduce such new states .",
    "the occupation at zero temperature is then as follows .",
