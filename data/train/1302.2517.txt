    "jones developed the effect by representation of @xmath6 matrix @xcite @xmath7 if the input polarization of light is unaltered after going through an optical medium , then the state can be identified as the eigenvector @xmath8 of the optical component @xmath9 following the eigen value equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the corresponding eigenvalue of a particular polarization matrix @xmath12 + the optical properties such as birefringence and dichroism of a homogeneous medium can be described by the differential matrix @xmath13.jones @xcite pointed out that @xmath13 governs the propagation of the polarized light vector @xmath14 at a particular wavelength through an infinitesimal distance within the optical element @xmath15 where it is evident that @xmath13 is the operator that determines @xmath16 from polarization matrix @xmath17 as follows @xmath18 if @xmath13 is independent of z , it shows its dependence on polarization matrix m @xcite by @xmath19    in the lamellar representation suggested by jones @xcite , a thin slab of a given medium is equivalent to a pile of retardation plates and partial polarizers .",

    "the evolution of the ray vector @xmath26 as in eq.(3 ) passing through such medium @xmath13 , could be re - written as @xmath27 for pure birefringent medium represented by eq.(8 ) , one may use the evolution of ray vector @xmath28 which implies that the spatial variation of component of electric vectors in one direction give the effect in the other perpendicular direction .",
    "thus an exchange of optical power between the two component states of the polarized light takes place indicating the rotation of the ray vector after entering the medium .",
