    "the theory of complex dynamical systems , which has its origin in the important work of fatou and julia in the 1910s , has been investigated by many people and discussed in depth .",
    "in particular , since d. sullivan showed the famous `` no wandering domain theorem '' using teichmller theory in the 1980s , this subject has attracted many researchers from a wide area . for a general reference on complex dynamical systems ,",
    "see milnor s textbook @xcite .",
    "there are several areas in which we deal with generalized notions of classical iteration theory of rational functions .",
    "one of them is the theory of dynamics of rational semigroups ( semigroups generated by holomorphic maps on the riemann sphere @xmath5 ) , and another one is the theory of random dynamics of holomorphic maps on the riemann sphere .    in this paper , we will discuss these subjects .",
    "a * rational semigroup * is a semigroup generated by a family of non - constant rational maps on @xmath5 , where @xmath5 denotes the riemann sphere , with the semigroup operation being functional composition ( @xcite ) .",
    "a * polynomial semigroup * is a semigroup generated by a family of non - constant polynomial maps .",
    "research on the dynamics of rational semigroups was initiated by a. hinkkanen and g. j. martin ( @xcite ) , who were interested in the role of the dynamics of polynomial semigroups while studying various one - complex - dimensional moduli spaces for discrete groups , and by f. ren s group(@xcite ) , who studied such semigroups from the perspective of random dynamical systems . moreover , the research on rational semigroups is related to that on  iterated function systems \" in fractal geometry .",

    "the research on the dynamics of rational semigroups is also directly related to that on the random dynamics of holomorphic maps .",
    "the first study in this direction was by fornaess and sibony ( @xcite ) , and much research has followed .",
    "( see @xcite . )",
    "we remark that the complex dynamical systems can be used to describe some mathematical models .",
    "for example , the behavior of the population of a certain species can be described as the dynamical system of a polynomial @xmath6 such that @xmath7 preserves the unit interval and the postcritical set in the plane is bounded ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . from this point of view",
    ", it is very important to consider the random dynamics of such polynomials ( see also example  [ realpcbex ] ) . for the random dynamics of polynomials on the unit interval , see @xcite .",
