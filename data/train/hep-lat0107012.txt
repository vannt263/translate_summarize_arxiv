    "recently it has been shown @xcite that nonperturbative gauge fixing @xcite can be applied successfully to decouple the longitudinal gauge degrees of freedom from abelian lattice chiral gauge theories in the limit of zero gauge coupling .",
    "after one gauge transforms a gauge - noninvariant lattice chiral gauge theory proposal like the smit - swift model or the domain wall waveguide model , one picks up the longitudinal gauge degrees of freedom ( radially frozen scalars ) explicitly in the action .",
    "the job of gauge fixing is to find a phase transition where the gauge symmetry would be restored with the scalars decoupled .",
    "the gauge fixing approach deals with anomaly - free chiral gauge theories .",
    "it is manifestly local .",
    "the gauge fixing action involves a kinetic term for the longitudinal gauge degrees of freedom and allows for a renormalizable weak coupling expansion .",
    "the so called _ reduced _ model is defined by taking the limit of zero gauge coupling , after gauge transforming the gauge - noninvariant theory .",
    "hence it has coupling between fermions and the scalars .",
    "the spectrum of the reduced model derived from the gauge fixed theory should be devoid of the scalars and consist only of free fermions in the appropriate representation of the chiral group .",
    "this is precisely what was achieved with recent investigations of smit - swift @xcite and domain wall models @xcite and tuning counterterms posed no practical problems . in the reduced model",
    "there is no constraint on the fermion representation from anomalies since the anomaly vanishes trivially in this case , and one can still study the fermion spectra .    in this communication",
    "we extend our detailed study @xcite of the u(1 ) lattice chiral gauge theory with domain wall fermions and gauge fixing in the reduced model limit .",
    "the reduced model has a yukawa coupling @xmath0 which was put in by hand .",
    "our previous study dealt with the situation at @xmath1 and showed that the scalar fields were completely decoupled from the fermions and chiral modes were obtained only at the domain wall and at the anti - domain wall as in free domain wall fermions .",
    "this makes the gauge fixed domain wall model suitable for a u(1 ) chiral gauge theory at @xmath1 . on the other hand , at @xmath2 , fermion current considerations and also numerical simulations",
    "show that mirror chiral modes develop at the so - called waveguide boundaries making it unsuitable for the construction of a chiral gauge theory .",
    "hence it is interesting to ask what happens at small nonzero values of yukawa coupling . in general",
    "it is desirable to understand the properties of a model for all possible values of the coupling parameters . here",
    "we investigate the gauge fixed domain wall waveguide model in the reduced limit for small nonzero values of the yukawa coupling .",
    "kaplan s free domain wall fermions @xcite on a @xmath3-dimensional @xmath4 lattice ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 labeling the 5-th dimension ) with periodic boundary conditions in the 5-th direction and the domain wall mass taken as @xmath7 possess a lefthanded ( lh ) chiral mode bound to the domain wall at @xmath8 and a righthanded ( rh ) chiral mode bound to the anti - domain wall at @xmath9 . for @xmath10 ,",
    "these modes have exponentially small overlap .    a 4-dimensional gauge field which is independent of @xmath6",
    "is then coupled to fermions only for a restricted number of @xmath6-slices around say , the anti - domain wall @xcite with a view to coupling only to the rh mode at the anti - domain wall .",
    "the gauge field is thus confined within a _ waveguide _ , @xmath11 the waveguide boundaries @xmath12 and @xmath13 should be reasonably far away from the domain wall and the anti - domain wall .    obviously , the hopping terms from @xmath12 to @xmath14 and that from @xmath13 to @xmath15 would break the local gauge invariance of the action .",
    "this is taken care of by gauge transforming the action and thereby picking up the longitudinal gauge degrees of freedom or radially frozen scalar fields @xmath16 at the waveguide boundary , leading to the action ( lattice constant is taken to be unity throughout ) : @xmath17 where we have suppressed all indices other than @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are the fermion fields , the projector @xmath20 is @xmath21 and @xmath0 is the yukawa coupling introduced by hand at the waveguide boundaries . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively the gauge covariant dirac operator and the wilson term ( with wilson @xmath24 ) in 4 space - time dimensions . @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the 4-dimensional free dirac and wilson operators .    the gauge fixed pure gauge action for @xmath27 , where the ghosts are free and decoupled , is : @xmath28 where , @xmath29 is the usual wilson plaquette action and @xmath30 is a counterterm .",
    "previous studies @xcite show that only a gauge field mass counterterm is needed .",
    "@xmath31 is the gauge fixing term which is not just a naive lattice transcription of the continuum covariant gauge fixing , it has in addition appropriate irrelevant terms . as a result , @xmath31 has a unique absolute minimum at @xmath32 , validating weak coupling perturbation theory around gauge coupling @xmath33",
    ". for an explicit expression of @xmath31 , see @xcite .",
    "obviously , the action @xmath34 is not gauge invariant . by giving it a gauge transformation",
    "the resulting action is @xmath35 . by restricting to the trivial orbit , @xmath32",
    ", we arrive at the reduced model action @xmath36 where @xmath37 is obtained quite easily from eq.([wgact ] ) and @xmath38 \\label{redb}\\ ] ] now is a higher - derivative scalar field theory action and @xmath39 is given by , @xmath40 perturbation theory around @xmath33 translates in the reduced model to the same around @xmath41 .    in the following ,",
    "we investigate the action ( [ reduced ] ) at small nonzero @xmath0 by numerical methods . to follow up the numerical investigation , analytic studies",
    "will then be made again at small @xmath0 with slightly different boundary conditions .",
    "at @xmath2 , the domain wall and the anti - domain wall are detached from each other .",
    "in fact , in this case there is no coupling between the 4-dimensional worlds living on the @xmath12-th and the @xmath42-th slices ( and similarly for the @xmath13-th and the @xmath43-th slices ) . from fermion",
    "current considerations , the lh chiral mode bound to the domain wall at @xmath8 would then necessitate the generation of a rh mode at @xmath44 and also at @xmath45 .",
    "similarly a lh mode , mirror to the rh chiral mode at the anti - domain wall at @xmath9 , would be generated at @xmath46 and also at @xmath47 .",
    "our numerical simulations at @xmath2 and similar studies in @xcite clearly show that mirror chiral modes form at the waveguide boundaries .",
    "generation of these mirror modes at the waveguide boundaries is independent of gauge fixing .    on the other hand , with gauge fixing at @xmath1 @xcite ,",
    "the mirror chiral modes are certainly absent at the waveguide boundaries . in this case , the only chiral modes are at the domain wall and at the anti - domain wall and the spectrum is that of a free domain wall fermion .    to investigate the interesting question",
    "what happens at small @xmath0 , we looked for chiral modes at @xmath48 , especially at the waveguide boundaries .",
    "specifically we numerically evaluate the @xmath49 and the @xmath50 propagators in momentum space conjugate to the 4 space - time dimensions and in configuration space for the 5-th ( flavor - like ) dimension .",
    "this is done using quenched configurations of the scalar fields at @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this choice of the coupling parameters puts the theory quite close to the phase transition from a ferromagnetic broken phase ( fm ) to a rotationally noninvariant broken phase ( fmd ) , staying within the fm phase ( in the full theory with dynamical gauge fields fm - fmd is the transition where gauge symmetry is restored ) . for a detailed discussion of the phase diagram of the quenched reduced model",
    ", please see @xcite .",
    "the ( @xmath53 ) point we have chosen for the present investigation is also where we had previously done all our work at @xmath1 .    on a @xmath54 lattice with @xmath55 and @xmath56 ,",
    "the chiral propagators at the waveguide boundaries showed an increasing trend as the fourth component of momentum @xmath57 ( with @xmath58 ) was decreased to the minimum value possible for this lattice size , something that could signify a pole at zero momentum , thereby indicating possible presence of mirror modes .",
    "the lower the yukawa coupling , the sharper was the increasing trend of the chiral propagators with decreasing @xmath57 .    for a closer scrutiny we then took lattice sizes which were bigger in the 4-th direction to accommodate lower @xmath57-values .",
    "we found that for each @xmath0 there is a big enough lattice size for which the chiral propagators ultimately start showing a decreasing trend , indicating possible absence of mirror modes .",
    "obviously the smaller the yukawa coupling , the bigger the @xmath59 extension was required . moreover ,",
    "all the chiral propagators at these small yukawa couplings matched exactly with the corresponding free chiral propagators .",
    "these free chiral propagators were numerically determined by inverting the free fermionic action ( obtained by putting @xmath60 in the reduced fermionic action @xmath37 ) with the respective values of the yukawa couplings ( the free fermionic action at @xmath1 is the free domain wall action of kaplan @xcite ) .",
    "our results at the waveguide boundaries @xmath61 , and @xmath62 are summarized in fig.[wgby ] for the @xmath50 and the @xmath49 propagators respectively . in the figures , sf and ff respectively indicate data obtained by numerical simulation of the scalar - fermion reduced model , eq.([reduced ] ) , and by direct numerical inversion of the free fermion matrix ( i.e. with @xmath63 ) at the given yukawa couplings .",
    "error bars are smaller than the symbols .",
    "dotted lines joining the data points are to guide the eye .",
    "figure [ wgby ] also contains our previous data at @xmath1 @xcite for comparison . from the figures ,",
    "existence of poles at zero 4-momentum for these chiral propagators does not seem likely .",
    "similar numerical investigation is also carried out at the other waveguide boundary @xmath13 , @xmath15 . there",
    "too evidence for mirror modes is dim .",
    "to confirm the indication from our numerical simulation that , for small @xmath0 , the chiral propagators at the waveguide boundaries do not seem to have poles at zero momentum , it would be nice to calculate the propagators analytically .",
    "this can be done in perturbation theory in the coupling @xmath65 .",
    "this was also done for the fermion propagators to 1-loop in our previous investigation at @xmath1 @xcite .    the present case , however , is more complicated due to the presence of two more defects created at the two waveguide boundaries because of @xmath66 , in addition to the existing defects , namely , the domain wall at @xmath8 and the anti - domain wall at @xmath9 .",
    "the defects are the places across which translational invariance is not maintained and boundary conditions need to be imposed to match the propagators from two sides of each defect .    in this section",
    "we leave kaplan boundary conditions and use shamir boundary conditions @xcite because imposing boundary conditions in the shamir case would be a lot less tedious and our conclusions would qualitatively be the same as in the kaplan case .    the free dirac operator in the shamir case is defined on 4 space - time dimensions plus a finite 5-th dimension , @xmath67 with rigid walls at @xmath8 and @xmath68 .",
    "the domain wall mass is taken as @xmath69 for all @xmath70slices .",
    "fermionic spectrum then consists of a lh chiral mode at @xmath8 and a rh chiral mode at @xmath9 .",
    "( for further discussion see @xcite and @xcite . )    the waveguide in this case can be implemented by putting the same 4-dimensional gauge field over @xmath6-slices from @xmath14 to @xmath71 with a view to gauging only the rh mode at @xmath68 .",
    "the hopping terms from @xmath12 to @xmath14 again break the local gauge invariance of the action .",
    "longitudinal gauge degrees of freedom or radially frozen scalar fields @xmath16 enter the action explicitly after a gauge transformation .",
    "the reduced model is then obtained by imposing @xmath32 : @xmath72    the fermion propagators are obtained in momentum space for 4 space - time dimensions while staying in the coordinate space for the 5-th dimension .",
    "the procedure in the following is applicable to all values of the yukawa coupling @xmath0 including @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "needless to say , it is also applicable to kaplan boundary conditions .    in order to develop perturbation theory , in reduced model , we expand , @xmath73    thus the fermion action at the tree level is written as , @xmath74 \\widetilde{\\psi_p^t } \\label{bfmom}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",

    "however , @xmath103 and @xmath104 can be obtained for finite @xmath116 by solving the above equations numerically for different @xmath117 values . this way we can easily construct the tree level fermion propagators at any given @xmath6-slice .",

    "1-loop corrections to the tree level @xmath49 and @xmath50 propagators above can be easily found following @xcite and as in @xmath1 are found to be negligible .",
    "this is because the scalar fields are almost completely decoupled .    using the analytic method described above , on a @xmath119 lattice with @xmath120 and @xmath56 , we plot in fig.[wgb ] tree level @xmath50 propagators for @xmath121 at the waveguide boundary @xmath122 . from the figure",
    "it is clearly seen that there are no poles in these propagators , ruling out any possibility of a mirror mode at the waveguide boundary at any nonzero @xmath0 ( including arbitrarily small @xmath0 ) .",
    "in our previous study @xcite we investigated the u(1 ) gauge fixed domain wall waveguide model in the reduced limit at yukawa coupling @xmath1 .",
    "although the theory contained scalars explicitly in the action as a result of gauge noninvariance , we found no evidence of them .",
    "the fermionic spectrum was that of a free domain wall fermion .",
    "since the yukawa interaction couples only the two slices across a waveguide boundary , there is a new defect introduced at a waveguide boundary when @xmath66 . especially at @xmath2 mirror chiral modes",
    "are developed at the waveguide boundaries .",
    "it is an interesting question to find out if these mirror modes persist to exist even for small values of the yukawa coupling .",
    "our numerical investigations ( at small @xmath0 ) of chiral propagators at the waveguide boundaries initially show a disturbing trend of increasing with decreasing momentum . on bigger lattices and smaller momenta ,",
    "however , this trend does not continue and poles of the chiral propagators do not seem likely .",
    "in addition , the data agree quite well with free chiral propagators obtained by numerically inverting the fermion matrix after putting @xmath63 for all the @xmath0 values .",
    "agreement with free propagators means that the scalar fields are decoupled .    to be able to go to much smaller momentum",
    ", we then perform an analytic calculation of the propagators at @xmath64 in the perturbative limit @xmath41 .",
    "although done with different boundary conditions than we started with , qualitative conclusions can at least be made and the analytic tree propagators certainly show a very good resemblance to the numerically calculated ones and confirm the view that there are no poles for these propagators at the waveguide boundaries",
    ".    our conclusion would be that even for arbitrarily small or any nonzero yukawa coupling , the fermion spectrum would be devoid of any ill - effects of the scalar fields .",
    "in fact the scalar fields are completely decoupled .",
    "this happens because the continuum limit is taken at the fm - fmd transition where the scalars do not scale , being far away from a ferromagnetic - paramagnetic transition . obviously from a quenched numerical simulation alone",
    ", we can not come to a firm conclusion .",
    "however , the 1-loop corrections to the perturbative tree level fermion propagators are negligibly small and fermion loops enter the calculation at least at the two loop level . hence our conclusions about nonexistence of the mirror modes at the waveguide boundaries for small @xmath0 seem to be correct even for the situation with dynamical fermions as long as the phase diagram stays qualitatively the same with dynamical fermions .",
    "once the continuum limit can be taken at the fm - fmd transition , even an arbitrrily small @xmath0 ( which effectively mimics a scaling radial mode of the scalar fields ) can not produce the mirror modes and spoil the theory .",
