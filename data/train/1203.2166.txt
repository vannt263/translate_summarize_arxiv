    "any change of the associated contact form @xmath2 does not change the conformal symplectic class of @xmath5 restricted to @xmath6 .",

    "a manifold @xmath11 is said to be an _ almost contact manifold _ if the structure group of its tangent bundle can be reduced to @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , cooriented contact manifolds are almost contact manifolds and such a reduction of the structure group of the tangent bundle of a manifold @xmath11 is a necessary condition for the existence of a cooriented contact structure on @xmath11 . it is unknown whether this condition is in general sufficient .",
    "+ nevertheless there are cases in which the existence of an almost contact structure is sufficient for the manifold to admit a contact structure .",
    "for example , if the manifold @xmath11 is open then one can apply gromov s @xmath13principle techniques to conclude that the condition is sufficient .",
    "see the result 10.3.2 in @xcite .",
    "the scenario is quite different for closed almost contact manifolds . using results of lutz @xcite and martinet @xcite",
    "one can show that every cooriented tangent @xmath14plane field on a closed oriented @xmath15manifold is homotopic to a contact structure . a good account of this result from a modern perspective is given in  @xcite .",
    "for manifolds of higher dimensions there are various results establishing the sufficiency of the condition .",
    "important instances of these are the construction of contact structures on certain principal @xmath16bundles over closed symplectic manifolds due to boothby and wang  @xcite , the existence of a contact structure on the product of a contact manifold with a surface of genus greater than zero following bourgeois  @xcite and the existence of contact structures on simply connected @xmath0dimensional closed orientable manifolds obtained by geiges @xcite and its higher dimensional analogue  @xcite .",
    "+ the work in this article was presented in the spring 2012 aim workshop on higher dimensional contact geometry . in its course , j. etnyre commented on a possible alternative approach in the framework of giroux s program using an open book decomposition .",
    "the argument has been subsequently written and it is the content of the article @xcite .",
    "+ let us turn our attention to @xmath0manifolds since the main goal of this article is to show that any orientable almost contact @xmath0manifold is contact . in this case",
    "h. geiges has been studying existence results in other situations apart from the simply connected one . in @xcite a positive result is also given for spin closed manifolds with @xmath17 , and spin closed manifolds with finite fundamental group of odd order are studied in  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "there is also a construction of contact structures on an orientable @xmath0manifold occurring as a product of two lower dimensional manifolds by geiges and stipsicz  @xcite .",
    "while geiges used the topological classification of simply connected manifolds for his results in  @xcite , one of the ingredients in @xcite is a decomposition result of a @xmath18manifold into two stein manifolds with common contact boundary  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "+ being an almost contact manifold is a purely topological condition . in fact , the reduction of the structure group can be studied via obstruction theory .",
    "for example , in the @xmath0dimensional situation a manifold @xmath11 is almost contact if and only if the third integral steifel  whitney class @xmath19 vanishes .",
    "actually , using this hypothesis and the classification of simply connected manifolds due to d. barden  @xcite , h. geiges deduces that any manifold with @xmath20 can be obtained by legendrian surgery from certain model contact manifolds . though this approach is elegant , it seems quite difficult to extend these ideas to produce contact structures on any almost contact @xmath0manifold .",
