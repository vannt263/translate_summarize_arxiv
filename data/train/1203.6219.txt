    "at heliocentric distances of about 0.3 au the magnetic field spectrum in the fast streams of the solar wind has a form of a double power - law with a break at about @xmath4 and a slope of approximately @xmath5 and @xmath1 at lower and higher frequencies respectively @xcite .",
    "fluctuations in these two ranges have a different evolution with distance @xcite .",
    "the low frequency part approximately follows the wkb behavior , @xmath6 , dictated by the solar wind expansion .",
    "the high frequency part instead decreases much sharply , its energy content being depleted by the turbulent cascade , and maintains approximately the same spectral slope . therefore , the frequency break shifts to lower and lower frequency as the heliocentric distance increases , the @xmath0 spectrum occupying the range @xmath7 at 1  au @xcite .",
    "the energy in the low frequency tail progressively contributes to the turbulent heating of the solar wind .",
    "the spectral evolution can be understood as a competition between the expansion timescale and the cascade timescale , regulating the decay of energy respectively at small and at large scales @xcite , but the origin of the @xmath0 spectrum is still a matter of debate .",
    "there are some indications that it may have a genuine solar origin , reflecting the emergence , cancellation , and sinking of the magnetic field at the photosphere : spectra built from magnetogram data at low - intermediate latitudes show a @xmath0 slope at low wavenumbers , which also correlate to the spectrum of density fluctuations in the heliosphere @xcite . in this view",
    ", the formation mechanism relies on magnetic reconnection , occurring over a hierarchy of scales as a stochastic process with some self - similar properties .",
    "reconnection , this time in the corona , has also been invoked as the underlying process , since the timescale associated to the restructuring of coronal magnetic field is about 1 day , i.e. in the range of observed frequencies @xcite . recently",
    "the formation of a @xmath0 spectrum has been observed in homogeneous incompressible mhd simulations of very long duration , probably originating from an inverse cascade not associated with well defined invariants @xcite .",
    "other ideas rely on large scale properties of the corona and solar wind : reflection was suggested as a possible mechanism to obtain a @xmath8 spectrum from an isotropic cascade of alfvn waves waves coming from the sun in the expanding solar wind @xcite .",
    "the linear evolution of alfvnic pulses excited in the corona leads to a signal ( outside the alfvnic critical point ) which has periodicities of about 15 - 30 minutes ( ringing of the corona , @xcite ) .",
    "though this period appears too low to account for the entire range of observed frequencies , as suggested by the authors , the ringing of the corona could play a role in the formation of the @xmath0 spectrum .    in this letter",
    ", we combine the latter two ideas , the ringing of the corona and nonlinear interactions with reflected waves , to study the formation of the magnetic field spectrum advected by the solar wind . to this aim",
    ", we use a shell reduced mhd model @xcite to follow the onset of turbulence resulting from the coupling between alfvn waves propagating in the chromosphere , corona , and sub - alfvnic solar wind .",
    "the solar wind profiles ( alfvn speed , velocity and density profiles ) are given steady numerical solutions of the slow wind model by @xcite .",
    "such slow wind solutions are chosen to illustrate the mechanism responsible for the formation of the @xmath0 spectrum , fast wind solutions will be considered in a forthcoming paper .    in homogeneous turbulence with equal energy in both alfvn species the forcing controls the development of a weak ( or strong ) cascade , depending on whether the parallel alfvn time is smaller ( or not ) than the nonlinear time .",
    "the energy density scales with perpendicular wave number as @xmath9 or @xmath10 ( e.g. @xcite ) for both species .",
    "however , in the inhomogeneous stratified open corona and solar wind , the two alfvn wave species can in principle have very different amplitudes .",
    "we will see that they follow different cascade regimes ( weak / strong ) at the same time .",
    "this is the key of the results obtained in the present letter .",
    "we show that for realistic conditions a @xmath0 magnetic spectrum forms as a consequence of the strong turbulent cascade of reflected / inward propagating waves , which reflect back ( ringing ) at the transition region ( tr ) and are advected outside the alfvnic critical point without substantial modification , since the outward propagating waves experience a weak cascade .",
    "the model equations are obtained from the mhd equations by separating the large - scale _ stationary _ fields and small - scale fluctuating fields @xcite . among the large - scale fields ,",
    "the wind speed ( @xmath11 ) and density ( @xmath12 ) are the solution of a 1d hydro - dynamic solar wind model @xcite with specified heating functions and assigned flux tube expansion ( @xmath13 ) . combining @xmath12 with the magnetic field strength @xmath14 at the base of the fluxtube , and requiring @xmath15",

    "the reflected wave @xmath76 is always in a strong turbulence regime and follows the cb condition at any position , except for a small offset at low wavenumbers due to the linear coupling ( reflection ) at large scale . on the contrary the correlation time of @xmath75",
    "is almost horizontal , i.e. almost independent of the nonlinear time and of distance , and lies entirely in the weak turbulence regime . since @xmath102 is the inverse of the width of the frequency spectrum , one can conclude that the @xmath94 spectrum does not change much as it propagates outward , only becoming a bit narrower at large scales .",
    "instead , the @xmath86 spectrum widens while propagating backward from @xmath52 , according to cb .",
    "once it arrives at the tr it experiences strong reflection and feeds the @xmath94 spectrum , this can be argued by noting that @xmath103 at @xmath100 ( the low end of the curves ) . at larger distances",
    "@xmath104 , showing that @xmath90 is wider than @xmath105 in the whole corona , the difference owing to its high - frequency over - excitation .",
    "the @xmath0 spectrum appearing at large perpendicular scales in @xmath94 is thus made up of two parts , each occupying about one decade from @xmath106 , which originate from two different mechanisms : linear coupling with @xmath86 at low frequencies ( the strong turbulence range ) , and weak turbulent cascade at intermediate frequencies .",
    "this is summarized in figure  [ fig4 ] where the reduced frequency spectra @xmath107 of kinetic and magnetic energy at @xmath108 are shown , ( along with the input spectrum at the base of the chromosphere @xmath109 ) .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath110 shows the @xmath0 slope inherited from the large scale eddies in @xmath94 , in which one can recognize the above two components , and a break appears at about @xmath111 where the slope switches to @xmath3 .",
    "the break coincides with the width of the forcing spectrum ( @xmath112 ) and the @xmath3 slope is consistent with the fall - off at high frequencies in @xmath113 .",
    "note that linear propagation alone would lead to a magnetic spectrum with slope @xmath114 ( not shown ) , thus nonlinear interactions are fundamental to obtain the @xmath0 slope .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath115 is practically identical to @xmath110 for @xmath116 due to the same over - excitation in the weak regime . for lower frequencies instead the slope of @xmath115 is flatter , having a value of about @xmath117 .",
    "why the @xmath0 extends down to low frequencies only in @xmath110 can be understood by examining the wave reflection at the tr , where density gradients are higher . for frequencies",
    "@xmath118\\simeq 2~\\mathrm{hz}$ ] , one can write @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the alfvn speed contrast between the chromosphere and corona @xcite . at the tr , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , thus reflection transfers the low - frequency large - eddy spectrum of @xmath86 to @xmath110 but not to @xmath115 . in reality",
    "reflection occurs in the whole low corona ( for @xmath123 at frequencies @xmath124 ) and is a continuous process .",
    "moreover , reflected waves are made of two components : a classical one , propagating backward in the region @xmath125 and subject to ringing in the low corona , and an anomalous component that instead propagates outward with the mother wave @xcite .",
    "nonlinear interactions are not limited to the duration of the encounter of colliding @xmath126 wavepackets , but part of them occur on the common outward propagation path .",
    "this is why linear and also nonlinear couplings affect the low tail of the @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "bearing in mind that @xmath76 is entirely generated by reflection inside the solar atmosphere , we examine now what happens if we increase the input turbulence strength ( i.e the control parameter @xmath92 ) by either increasing the correlation time @xmath45 or decreasing the input nonlinear time @xmath127 . by imposing a shorter input nonlinear time , no matter if through @xmath42 or @xmath43 , we increase the strength of the cascade for @xmath76",
    ". the strength of the @xmath75 cascade will increase only slightly , since the reflected wave will be damped more strongly , yielding approximately the same @xmath128 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath94 will thus be affected only slightly , except that now nonlinear coupling will dominate over reflection in the low corona , eroding the very low frequency tail of the @xmath0 spectrum in @xmath110 . if instead we choose a longer correlation time at input , we increase the amount of reflected waves thus also increasing the strength of the cascade for @xmath75 . this time",
    "the high - frequency tail of the @xmath0 spectrum will be eroded , since a stronger cascade reduces the energy in the over - excited weak - turbulence regime of @xmath94 .",
    "finally , one can vary the importance of linear / nonlinear coupling through the other free parameter @xmath14 . taking a smaller chromospheric magnetic field",
    "will lower the alfvnic critical point , reducing the importance of linear terms compared to the nonlinear ones in eq .",
    "[ eq : wave ] .",
    "the changes in the @xmath110 spectrum are similar to those discussed above for a shorter @xmath129 .",
    "note however that halving @xmath14 moves @xmath52 to a distance of @xmath130 , so that one is limited to small variations of this parameter .",
    "a last remark concerns the non - local couplings in the fourier space that are neglected in the shell model employed in this work . in principle",
    "they could change the perpendicular spectra and the strength of the cascade . however , our understanding of the process of formation of the @xmath0 spectrum is that it comes from the different nature of the two direct @xmath76 and @xmath75 cascades , not because of an inverse cascade as in the dynamo process .",
    "we expect these direct cascades not to change when including nonlocal interactions .",
    "the formation of the @xmath0 spectrum by nonlinear and linear coupling in the sub - alfvnic solar wind appears to be quite solid , however its relation to the interplanetary spectrum observed at @xmath131  au is not straightforward .",
    "beyond @xmath52 the solar wind expansion causes the rotation of the magnetic field , a slower production of reflected waves , and a decrease of wave - numbers perpendicular to the radial direction @xcite .",
    "the latter two actually suggest a freezing of the spectra . on the contrary",
    "the magnetic field rotation causes instabilities and wave coupling / decay that could modify the spectrum .",
    "numerical simulations of mhd equations in 1d and 2d incorporating the effect of an expanding solar wind @xcite suggest that the decay and instability rates are delayed with respect to the non - expanding case , so that a freezing of the advected spectra may be a good approximation , at least until @xmath131  au .",
    "if one assumes no further evolution , the double - power - law measured by helios at 0.3 au , may result from the combination of the parallel and perpendicular reduced spectra . at low frequency",
    "the parallel spectrum dominates with its characteristic slope @xmath5 , while at higher frequencies its steep spectral slope ( @xmath3 ) is masked by the more energetic perpendicular spectrum ( with a @xmath1 slope ) .",
    "our theory might well be tested by the measurements of solar probe plus .",
