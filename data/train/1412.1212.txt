    "the purpose of this paper is to provide the regularity of sonic curves arising from a two - dimensional riemann problem governed by a self - similar nonlinear wave equations .",
    "let density be @xmath1 , velocity @xmath2 , the pressure @xmath3 be given as a function of @xmath1 . from the well - known 2-d compressible euler system for isentropic flow , when the flow is irrotational and the nonlinear velocity terms",
    "are ignored , we can derive the following nonlinear wave system @xmath4 where @xmath5 are momenta .",
    "we refer the readers to @xcite for more information on this system . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the 2-d riemann problem of system with chaplygin gas equation of state @xmath6 .",
    "the chaplygin gas , which can be used to depict some dark - energy models in cosmology , has been widely studied .",
    "recently , some interesting and important results have been obtained , especially for the riemann problem .",
    "we refer to @xcite and the references cited therein for the related results .    for decades , there have been wide and intensive developments in the riemann problems of conservation laws , in particular the 2-d compressible euler system and its simple models @xcite .",
    "such models are the unsteady transonic small disturbance ( utsd ) equations @xcite , the pressure gradient system @xcite , the potential flow @xcite , and the nonlinear wave equations @xcite and so on . for riemann problems in two - dimensional flow ,",
    "those governing equations become quasilinear and mixed types .",
    "the type of the flow in the far - field is hyperbolic , while near the origin the type is mixed .",
    "the sonic lines , located between the elliptic part and the hyperbolic part , are important to obtain the global existence of solutions to the mixed type problem .",
    "in this paper we consider the presence of the semi - hyperbolic patches with a transonic shock and a sonic curve in a simple wave environment .",
    "the regions identified by the existence of a family of characteristics that start on sonic curves and end on transonic shock curves are called semi - hyperbolic patches . the study on this region",
    "was initiated in @xcite via the pressure gradient system and is being continued in @xcite .",
    "these regions are different from the typical fully hyperbolic regions . as in the result of @xcite , in several numerical calculations ,",
    "we frequently encounter this kind of regions in several configurations in the two - dimensional riemann problems of the euler system as well as its simplified models ( figure 1 ) .",
    "one of the examples for semi - hyperbolic patches happens when air is accelerated in a planar tunnel over a small inward bulge on one of the walls @xcite",
    ".    a global solution to the boundary value problem of the riemann problem of a hyperbolic system can be patched together by pieces along characteristic lines , sonic curves , shock waves or other natural boundaries .",
    "we believe that it is helpful and essential to understand these patches of solutions locally before resolving the riemann problems globally .",
    "in @xcite , hu and wang have studied the semi - hyperbolic patches of solutions to the 2-d nonlinear wave system for chaplygin gas state .",
    "they have constructed the global existence of solutions by solving a goursat - type boundary value problem which has a sonic curve as a degenerate boundary , and verified that the sonic curve is lipschitz continuous . however , the smoothness of the sonic curve and the exact behavior of solutions near the sonic curve are still open .",
    "the main difficulty is the degeneracy of hyperbolicity near the sonic lines . in several numerical simulations",
    ", we can see that the demarcation line between hyperbolic regions and elliptic regions is decomposed of sonic curves and a transonic shock .",
    "also the pressure seems to change smoothly across the sonic curves .",
    "hence , we mainly focus on the study of the solutions precise behaviors near sonic curves , and expect better regularity of sonic curves . as a result , we prove that the semi - hyperbolic patches are uniformly smooth up to the sonic curves , and the sonic curves are @xmath0 continuous .",
    "in the self - similar coordinate @xmath7 , the nonlinear wave system ( [ nws ] ) becomes @xmath8 which yields a second order partial differential equation of @xmath3 @xmath9 the two characteristics @xmath10 are defined by @xmath11 when @xmath12 . in the polar coordinate system @xmath13 ,",
    "the equation ( [ eq : one - nonlinear ] ) becomes @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a simple notation of @xmath16 .",
    "equation ( [ no - rta ] ) is elliptic in the region of @xmath17 , and degenerates when @xmath18 . in particular , in the area of @xmath19 , it is hyperbolic , and two characteristics can be defined by @xmath20    in the hyperbolic region , equation ( [ no - rta ] ) can be decoupled to @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are directional derivatives along the positive and negative characteristics , respectively .",
    "that is , we have a new system @xmath24 using this decomposition , the existence of solutions to ( [ matrix - eq ] ) can be obtained in the hyperbolic region even if we can not get the riemann invariants @xcite .",
    "letting @xmath25 we have @xmath26    at this point , let us give a short description of the problem and known results . in the self - similar coordinates , two constant states",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 are given with @xmath29 , and a planar wave @xmath30        n(\\xi , \\eta)=\\ln { \\frac}{p_4}{p(\\xi , \\eta ) } , \\\\[5pt ]        m(\\xi , \\eta)=m_1=m_4=0 ,     \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] connects these two constant states in the domain @xmath31 .",
    "let the point @xmath32 be @xmath33 , which is a sonic point satisfying @xmath34 .",
    "we draw a positive characteristic curve defined by ( [ cha_selfsimilar ] ) passing @xmath33 in the planar wave , and intersecting the bottom boundary of the planar wave at @xmath35 .",
    "next we draw a negative characteristic defined by ( [ cha_selfsimilar ] ) from @xmath35 toward the subsonic region , and let @xmath36 be the ending point of the negative characteristic on the sonic curve . upon this configuration in figure 2 ,",
    "if we assume that the negative characteristic @xmath37 is given , then the region @xmath38 bounded by two characteristics @xmath39 and @xmath37 forms a semi - hyperbolic region , and @xmath40 is a sonic curve .",

    "for given boundary conditions on @xmath44 , the global existence and a priori @xmath0 estimate of @xmath45 in the domain @xmath38 have been obtained in @xcite as follows :    ( * global existence * @xcite ) .",

    "furthermore , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are strictly negative if the boundary data of @xmath51 on @xmath44 are strictly negative , and @xmath52 on the sonic curve . and",
    "@xmath51 are uniformly bounded in the whole semi - hyperbolic region @xmath38 .",
    "in fact , we do not know exactly how far we can extend the @xmath0 solution in theorem [ knowntheorem ] towards the sonic boundary . in this paper , we improve the results of @xcite in the sense that the solutions in the semi - hyperbolic patches are _ uniformly _ smooth up to the sonic curve , where the degeneracy of hyperbolicity occurs , and that the sonic curve is @xmath0 continuous .",
    "in fact , the smoothness of sonic curve is a necessary requirement for the global existence of solutions in the region of @xmath53 in figure 2 for the future research .",
    "the main theorem is as follows .",
    "( * regularity * ) [ mainthm ] for the goursat problem with prescribed characteristic boundaries @xmath42 and @xmath43 , there exists a global uniformly smooth solution of ( [ matrix - eq ] ) in the domain @xmath38 under the same conditions as in theorem [ knowntheorem ] .",
    "moreover , the sonic line @xmath40 is @xmath0 continuous , and the two derivatives @xmath54 and @xmath55 approach a common value on the sonic curve with a rate of @xmath56 .    to overcome the difficulty of degeneracy",
    ", we will employ a new different coordinate system @xmath57 with @xmath58 in section 2 . under the new coordinates ,",
    "we derive new systems for @xmath59 .",

    ", we would like to mention the work of zhang and zheng @xcite first . in @xcite , for any given smooth curve as a sonic line with any specified non - tangential derivative of the speed of sound , they have constructed classical solutions from the sonic line towards the supersonic side by establishing a convergent iteration scheme . on the contrary , in @xcite q. wang and",
    "y. zheng solved a goursat problem and considered the regularity of solutions from the supersonic domain towards the sonic curve .",
    "they considered the problem from a different aspect but also hoped it can be used to build a transonic solution that bridges between a semi - hyperbolic patch to an elliptic domain .",
    "for the two - dimensional euler system , m. li and y. zheng @xcite studied the semi - hyperbolic patches of solutions . in a forthcoming paper @xcite , we will consider the regularity of sonic curves for the euler system .",
