    "negative refraction of light , first predicted to occur in materials with simultaneous negative permittivity and permeability in the late 60 s @xcite , has become one of the most active fields of research in photonics in the last decade . since the theoretical proposal for its realization in meta - materials @xcite and its first experimental demonstration @xcite for rf radiation",
    ", substantial technological progress has been made towards negative refraction for shorter and shorter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "this includes various approaches based on split - ring resonator meta - materials @xcite , photonic crystals @xcite as well as more unconventional designs like double rod @xcite or fishnet structures @xcite .    despite the wide variety of implementations",
    "a major challenge is the large loss rate of these materials @xcite . especially for potential applications such as sub - diffraction limit imaging @xcite or electromagnetic cloaking @xcite the suppression of absorption proofs to be crucial @xcite .",
    "the usually adopted figure of merit @xmath0}{{\\text{im}}[n ] } \\label{eq : fom}\\ ] ] reaches only values on the order of unity in all current meta - material implementations @xcite with a record value of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this means that the absorption length of these materials is only on the order of the wavelength .",
    "recently we have proposed a scheme in which coherent cross - coupling of an electric and a magnetic dipole resonance with the same transition frequencies in an atomic system @xcite leads to negative refraction with strongly suppressed absorption @xcite due to quantum interference effects similar to electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the value of the refractive index can be fine - tuned by the strength of the coherent coupling . in the present paper",
    "we provide a more detailed analysis of this scheme .",
    "in particular we will discuss under what conditions a magneto - electric cross coupling can induce negative refraction in atomic media without requiring @xmath2<0 $ ] . the model level scheme introduced in @xcite",
    "will be analyzed in detail .",
    "explicit expressions for the susceptibilities and cross - coupling coefficients will be derived and the limits of linear response theory explored .",
    "the important issue of non - radiative broadenings and local field corrections to the response will be discussed .",
    "furthermore we will derive an explicit expression for the impedance of a medium with magneto - electric cross coupling and show that it can be matched to vacuum via external laser fields such that reflection losses at interfaces can be avoided .",
    "finally we will give full account of the tensorial properties of the induced magneto - electric cross coupling and the resulting refractive index in the model system .",
    "we will show that in the model system discussed it is in general only possible to obtain isotropic negative refraction in 2d .",
    "in the following we discuss the prospects of negative refraction in media with magneto - electric cross - coupling .",
    "the electromagnetic constitutive relations between medium polarization @xmath3 or magnetization @xmath4 and the electromagnetic fields @xmath5 and @xmath6 are usually expressed in terms on permittivity and permeability only .",
    "important aspects of linear optical systems such as optical activity , which describes the rotation of linear polarization in chiral media can not be described in this way however .",
    "the most general linear relations that also include these effects read @xmath7 eqs.([eq : pendrychiral ] ) describe media with _ magneto - electric cross coupling _ which are also known as bianisotropic media @xcite . here",
    "the polarization @xmath3 gets an additional contribution induced by the magnetic field strength @xmath6 and likewise the magnetization is coupled to the electric field component @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 denote tensorial coupling coefficients between the electric and magnetic degrees of freedom , while @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the complex - valued permittivity and permeability tensors .",
    "as we use gaussian units the coefficients @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are unitless .",
    "the propagation properties of electromagnetic waves in such media are governed by the helmholtz equation @xmath14{\\protect{{\\bf e}}}=0 .",
    "\\label{eq : helmholtzchiral}\\ ] ] a general solution of this equation for the wave vector @xmath15 is very tedious @xcite and a comprehensive discussion of the most general case almost impossible . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we therefore assume the permittivity @xmath16 and the permeability @xmath17 to be isotropic @xmath18 , @xmath19 . we furthermore restrict ourselves to a one - dimensional theory by choosing the wave to propagate in the @xmath20-direction which leaves only the upper left @xmath21-submatrices of the tensors @xmath8 and @xmath9 relevant . at this point",
    "we restrict the discussion to media which allow for conservation of the photonic angular momentum at their interfaces .",
    "in particular , we assume the response matrices @xmath8 and @xmath9 to be diagonal in the basis @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 denote circular polarization basis vectors @xmath24 .",
    "this leads , e.g. , for @xmath8 , to @xmath25 = & \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc } ( \\xi_{eh}^{+}+\\xi_{eh}^{-})/2 & -i(\\xi_{eh}^{+}-\\xi_{eh}^{-})/2 & 0 \\\\[2 mm ] i(\\xi_{eh}^{+}-\\xi_{eh}^{-})/2 & ( \\xi_{eh}^{+}+\\xi_{eh}^{-})/2 & 0 \\\\[2 mm ] 0 & 0 & \\xi_{eh}^z \\end{array}\\right ) .",
    "\\end{split } \\label{eq : tensorstructurexi}\\ ] ] note that the tensor ( [ eq : tensorstructurexi ] ) includes also biisotropic media first discussed by pendry @xcite for negative refraction as a special case .",
    "such biisotropic media display a chiral behavior , i.e. , isotropic refractive indices which are different for the two circular eigen - polarizations . in section [ ch:2d ]",
    "we will give an example which implements a polarization independent but anisotropic index of refraction .",
    "using ( [ eq : tensorstructurexi ] ) the propagation equation for a left circular polarized wave traveling in the @xmath20-direction can be expressed as @xmath26 which can be solved for @xmath27 .",
    "as @xmath27 is related to the corresponding refractive index via @xmath28 we find @xmath29 note that for a vanishing cross - coupling ( @xmath30 ) this simplifies to the well known expression @xmath31 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : refind ] ) has more degrees of freedom than the non - chiral version and allows for negative refraction without requiring a negative permeability .",
    "for example if we set @xmath32 , with @xmath33 the refractive index ( [ eq : refind ] ) reads @xmath34 here and in the following we drop the superscript @xmath35 for notational simplicity .",
    "magnetic dipole transitions in atomic systems are a relativistic effect and thus magnetic dipoles are typically smaller than electric ones by factor given by the fine structure constant @xmath36 .",
    "since furthermore magnetic resonances are typically not radiatively broadened the magnetic susceptibility @xmath37 per dipole is typically less than the electric susceptibility @xmath38 by a factor given by the fine structure constant squared @xmath39 . on the other hand ,",
    "as we will show later on , the cross - coupling coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath41 scale only with one factor of @xmath42 .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ eq : refindsimple ] ) represents an improvement compared to non - chiral approaches , since a negative index can be achieved at densities where @xmath43 is still positive but @xmath44 .",

    "additionally , for closed loop schemes ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3level ] ) it is known from resonant nonlinear optics based on eit @xcite , that the dispersive cross - coupling , which in our case is the magneto - electric cross coupling , experiences constructive interference .",
    "in essence the coupling of an electric to a magnetic dipole transition should lead to negative refraction for significantly smaller densities of scatterers compared to non - chiral proposals @xcite .",

    "the critical parameter for this effect is the dephasing rate @xmath59 of the coherence @xmath60 between the two eit `` ground''-states @xmath48 and @xmath51 .",
