    "over the past few years several indirect lines of evidence have emerged in favor of massive stars as the progenitors of long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "these include the distribution of offsets of grbs from their host centers @xcite , the absence of optical afterglows from dark grbs @xcite , high column densities toward several grbs @xcite , and the inference of very high star formation rates in several grb host galaxies @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most convincing evidence comes from the detection of late - time ( @xmath6 days ) red bumps dominating the optical emission from several afterglows ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "while several interpretations of these bumps have been suggested @xcite , the preponderance of spectral and temporal evidence ( e.g.  @xcite ) indicates that these bumps are due to radioactive nickel emission from supernovae ( sne ) accompanying the bursts .",
    "these observations lend support to the collapsar model @xcite , in which the core of a massive star collapses to a black hole , which then accretes matter and powers the grb , while the rest of the star produces a supernova .",
    "a seemingly unavoidable consequence of this scenario is that the grb ejecta should expand into a medium modified by mass loss from the progenitor star . to first order , the expected density profile is @xmath0 , arising from constant mass loss rate and wind velocity .",
    "extensive efforts have been made to find evidence for such a density profile based on broad - band observations of the afterglow emission ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , these studies have been inconclusive in distinguishing between a wind density profile and a medium with uniform density , due in part to the lack of early observations ( particularly in the radio and submillimeter bands ) and the degeneracy between dust extinction and the intrinsic spectral slope in the optical and near - ir bands .",
    "thus , the signature of stellar mass loss remains the elusive missing link in the association of grbs and massive stars .    to date , the single exception to this disappointing trend is grb011121 , which provides strong evidence for a circumburst medium shaped by a stellar wind @xcite , and an accompanying sn @xcite .",
    "the reason for these unambiguous results is the combination of exquisite _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) observations , extensive near - ir data , and dual - band radio data .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented the @xmath7-ray properties and redshift ( @xmath8 ) of , along with multi - band ground - based and hst optical observations .",
    "the observations between 15 and 65 days after the burst reveal a red bump ( with a spectrum @xmath5 ) brighter than an extrapolation of the early data .",
    "@xcite interpret this emission as coming from a sn accompanying the burst , but note that the statistical significance of this result depends on the degree of collimation of the grb ejecta .",
    "this is because a more collimated outflow results in an earlier steepening of the afterglow lightcurves , and hence a more significant deviation at late time .    in this paper",
    "we present radio observations of , which point to a uniform density circumburst medium .",
    "we also show that the radio , optical , and x - ray data require an early jet break , which significantly strengthens the sn interpretation for the late - time emission . combining these two results",
    "we conclude that a @xmath9 density profile is not a required signature of a massive stellar progenitor .",
    "very large array ( vla ) observations were initiated 1.2 days after the burst using the standard continuum mode with @xmath10 mhz contiguous bands . a log of all observations is given in table  [ tab : rad ] .",
    "we used the extra - galactic source 3c286 ( j1331 + 305 ) for flux calibration , while the phase was monitored using j1356@xmath11343 .",
    "the data were reduced and analyzed using the astronomical image processing system @xcite .",
    "in figure  [ fig : rad ] we plot the 8.46 ghz lightcurve of , as well as the radio spectrum between 1.43 and 8.46 ghz on day 3.3 .",
    "the early emission is characterized by two important features .",
    "first , it is brightest ( @xmath12 mjy ) during the first observation ( @xmath13 days ) , and rapidly fades , @xmath14 , between @xmath15 and @xmath16 days .",
    "second , the spectral index between 1.43 and 8.46 at @xmath17 days is @xmath18 , and similarly at @xmath13 days @xmath19 based on the 8.46 and 22.5 ghz data .    the rapid fading and negative spectral slope are atypical for emission from the forward shock on the timescale of 1 day . in fact , for typical parameters , the radio band , @xmath20 , lies well below the peak of the synchrotron spectrum at early time , @xmath21 ghz @xcite ; here @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the fractions of shock energy carried by the magnetic fields and electrons , respectively , and @xmath24 is the afterglow kinetic energy . in this regime , the spectrum is @xmath25 ( or @xmath26 if @xmath27 , the synchrotron self - absorption frequency ; @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", the early radio flux is expected to either increase , as @xmath28 or @xmath29 @xcite , be flat @xcite , or decay as @xmath30 @xcite , followed by a steep decline as @xmath31 to @xmath32 when @xmath33 crosses the radio band .",
    "this behavior is observed in the most radio afterglows ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "since the early radio emission from does not follow this general trend , we conclude that it did not arise from the forward shock .    instead , we interpret the observed emission as coming from a reverse shock @xcite plowing back into the relativisitic ejecta .",
    "similar `` radio flares '' have been observed in several afterglows @xcite , in particular from grb990123 where the flare was shown to be the low - energy tail of the @xmath34 mag optical flash observed at @xmath35 s @xcite . in all cases in which a radio flare has been observed , the emission had similar properties to that from , namely a bright ( @xmath36 mjy ) flux measured at early time ( @xmath37 day ) followed by a rapid decline .",
    "hydrodynamical studies of the reverse shock ( e.g.  @xcite ) have shown that the radio emission depends on the properties of the ejecta and circumburst medium .",
    "in particular , the main implication of the radio flare from is that it effectively rules out a circumburst medium with a density profile @xmath0 ( hereafter , wind ) . @xcite",
    "have shown that in a wind environment , with typical afterglow parameters , the cooling frequency of the reverse shock , @xmath38 hz , is significantly lower than its characteristic frequency , @xmath39 hz .",
    "thus , the emission peaks at @xmath40 , with a flux , @xmath41 jy , independent of time until the reverse shock crosses the shell at @xmath42 s @xcite ; here @xmath43 light seconds is the initial width of the shell . following the shell crossing ,",
    "electrons are no longer accelerated , and since the reverse shock is highly radiative ( @xmath44 ) the emission decays exponentially .",
    "thus , strong emission from the reverse shock at @xmath45 days is not expected in a wind environment , indicating that the early radio emission from requires a circumburst medium with uniform density ( hereafter , ism ) .",
    "in addition , based on the flat spectral slope between @xmath46 and @xmath47 ghz measured at @xmath48 days , we conclude that for both the reverse and forward shocks @xmath49 ghz . otherwise , the emission from the reverse shock would be severely attenuated over this frequency range by the forward shock , @xmath50 , resulting in a significantly steeper spectrum ; here @xmath51 is the synchrotron optical depth .",
    "using the conditions inferred in  [ sec : rad ] we model the radio , optical , and x - ray data with a model describing self - consistently the time evolution of the forward and reverse shocks in a uniform density medium .",
    "we consider the optical data only at @xmath52 days since the emission at later times is dominated by a much redder component , possibly a sn @xcite .",
    "we return to this point in  [ sec : prog ] .",
    "the time evolution of the reverse shock spectrum ( @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 ) is described by @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and the time of peak emission , @xmath59 $ ] @xcite ; here @xmath60 s is the duration of @xcite , @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the initial lorentz factor , and @xmath63 is the circumburst density .",
    "the parameter @xmath64 describes the evolution of the reverse shock lorentz factor , @xmath65 , and the limits correspond to adiabatic expansion ( @xmath66 ) and pressure equilibrium between the forward and reverse shocks ( @xmath67 ) . to evaluate @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and",
    "@xmath70 we use the physical parameters of the ejecta and circumburst medium as inferred from the forward shock emission ( see below and table  [ tab : ij ] ) , in conjunction with equations 79 of @xcite for the thick shell case ( i.e.  when the reverse shock is relativistic and effectively decelerates the shell ) , and equations 1517 for the thin shell case ( i.e.  when the reverse shock can not decelerate the shell effectively ) .",
    "we set the nominal values of @xmath66 and @xmath71 for the thin and thick shell cases , respectively .",
    "thus , the only free parameter of the reverse shock emission is @xmath62 .    for the forward shock we use the time evolution of the synchrotron spectrum in the appropriate regime ( i.e.  spherical ism for @xmath72 : @xcite , and an expanding jet for @xmath73 : @xcite ) ; here @xmath74 , the jet break time , is the epoch at which @xmath75 , and @xmath76 is the half opening angle of the jet . to account for possible extinction within the host galaxy , @xmath77",
    ", we use the parametric extinction curves of @xcite and @xcite , along with the interpolation calculated by @xcite .",
    "the results of the two models ( thin and thick shell cases ) are shown in figures  [ fig : rad ]  and  [ fig : opt ] , and summarized in table  [ tab : ij ] .",
    "we find that both models provide an equally adequate fit ( with @xmath78 per degree of freedom ) , but @xmath62 is not well constrained , @xmath79 ( figure  [ fig : cont ] ) .",
    "more importantly , both models require collimated ejecta with @xmath3 day ( hereafter , jet ) .",
    "models with a significantly wider collimation angle have @xmath80 per degree of freedom , primarily because they underestimate the flux in the x - ray band by a factor of about @xmath81 , and can not explain the radio and optical emission simultaneously .    at the same time , the jet models underestimate the radio flux at @xmath82 days by about @xmath83 on day 16.3 , and about @xmath84 on day 32 .",
    "this is due to an apparent brightening of the radio emission on this timescale . since in the radio band @xmath85 ,",
    "one possible explanation for the brightening is that the forward shock encounters a density enhancement ; a density increase by a factor of ten is required .",
    "the flux in the optical bands would remain largely unaffected since @xmath86 ( see table  [ tab : ij ] ) , in which case the flux is independent of density .    using the parameters of the forward shock emission we calculate @xmath87 erg , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 @xmath91 using equations 4.134.16 of @xcite .",
    "the opening angle of the jet is @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "using this value we find a beaming corrected @xmath7-ray emergy , @xmath93 erg @xcite , typical for long - duration grbs @xcite , and a beaming corrected kinetic energy , @xmath94 erg , lower than the typical inferred values of @xmath95 to @xmath96 erg @xcite .",
    "in the previous section we did not consider the optical emission at @xmath97 days since it has a distinct spectrum , @xmath98 , compared to @xmath99 for the early afterglow data . moreover , the predicted brightness of the afterglow at late time is lower by a factor of about @xmath100 in the @xmath101 and @xmath102 bands compared to the flux measured with hst ( figure  [ fig : opt ] ) .",
    "these two observations indicate that the late - time emission comes from a separate component .",
    "@xcite interpreted this emission as coming from a supernova that occured at about the same time as the burst . however , they note that the significance of this conclusion depends sensitively on the time of the jet break . based solely on the optical data ,",
    "these authors were unable to significantly constrain @xmath74 .",
    "however , our combined radio , optical , and x - ray model with @xmath3 day indicates that the sn interpretation is secure .",
    "we gain further confidence about this interpretation by comparing the late - time emission to the optical emission from the type ic sn1998bw @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : opt ] we plot the combined emission from the afterglow of and sn1998bw redshifted to @xmath103 .",
    "we correct the sn lightcurves for galactic extinction , @xmath104 mag @xcite , as well as extinction within the host galaxy as determined in  [ sec : models ] .",
    "while sn1998bw does not provide a perfect fit to the data , the level of agreement is remarkable given that there are other effects at play ( e.g.  an earlier decay for a fainter luminosity ; @xcite ) .",
    "the conclusion that was accompanied by a supernova indicates that the progenitor must have been a massive star .",
    "however , we also demonstrated that the circumburst density profile is uniform , at least in the range @xmath105 to @xmath106 cm .",
    "this is the first case in which a massive progenitor and a uniform ambient medium have been associated directly , leading us to conclude that a strong density gradient , @xmath0 , on the lengthscales probed by the afterglow is not a required signature of a massive stellar progenitor .",
    "in fact , this may explain why the signature of stellar mass loss has not been observed in the majority of afterglows .",
    "the uniform medium around the progenitor of does not imply that the progenitor did not lose mass .",
    "in fact , it has been previously suggested that a relatively uniform medium can occur downstream from the wind termination shock @xcite .",
    "this region can extend out to @xmath107 cm .",
    "in addition , a density enhancement is expected at the termination shock , which can explain the increased radio flux at @xmath82 days compared to the jet model predictions (  [ sec : models ] ) .",
    "we showed that the early radio emission from was dominated by the reverse shock , and that this directly implies a uniform circumburst medium .",
    "the same conclusion holds for all bursts in which radio flares have been detected on the timescale of @xmath108 day .",
    "the broad - band data indicate that the ejecta underwent a jet break at @xmath109 day ( i.e.  @xmath110 ) , resulting in a significant deviation of the late - time optical emission measured with hst from an extrapolation of the model .",
    "combined with the spectral properties of the late emission , and a reasonable agreement with the optical emission of sn1998bw , this indicates that was accompanied by a supernova .",
    "thus , the progenitor of this burst was a massive star .",
    "the association of a massive stellar progenitor with a uniform circumburst medium indicates that the tedious search for a @xmath111 density profile may have been partly in vain .",
    "it appears that a wind profile does not necessarily accompany every grb , and in fact may not be the case for the majority of bursts .",
    "this result , in conjunction with the inferred wind medium for grb011121 which was also accompanied by a supernova , indicates that the circumburst environments of grbs are more diverse than the simple assumption of constant mass loss rate and wind velocity ; the interaction of the wind with the local environment may play a significant role .",
    "deeper insight into the structure of the circumburst medium requires rapid localizations and dense , multi - band follow - up .",
