    "superconductor ( s)/ferromagnet ( f ) structures are the ideal playground for the search for novel phase transitions : two different , competing orderings come into play in a controllable fashion .",
    "in fact , s / f heterostructures can be grown with different s and f thicknesses , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , so that the superconducting and ferromagnetic ordering have different effect . moreover , other external parameters , such as the temperature @xmath8 , can be used to vary the interactions between f and s. in the recent past , the attention has been focussed on the damped oscillatory behaviour of the cooper pairs superconducting wavefunction @xmath9 in the ferromagnet:@xcite the peculiarity of the s / f interaction makes the superconducting wavefunction @xmath10 oscillate in the f  layer , in addition to the conventional , `` proximity - effect - like '' , exponential decrease .",
    "this unique feature of s / f structures is at the origin of the superconductor - ferromagnet - superconductor ( sfs ) @xmath1-josephson junctions ( for a review , see refs . ) characterized by a ground state at phase difference @xmath11 between s  layers ( one can represent this effect by a sign change of the macroscopic superconducting wavefunction across the f  layer ) . in this case , one speaks of `` @xmath2 transition '' .",
    "a sketch of the spatial dependence of the wavefunction in the @xmath4 and @xmath12 states is reported in fig .  1 : in the `` @xmath0 '' state",
    ", @xmath10 is only depressed in the f  layer . in the `` @xmath1 '' state , @xmath10 has zero value in the middle of the f  layer , and changes sign .",
    "the @xmath1 shift has , among the others , the spectacular consequence of spontaneous supercurrents in ring - shaped structures incorporating @xmath1 junctions.@xcite up to now , experiments were directed towards transport observations of the @xmath1shift of the wavefunction : the efforts were concentrated in measurements of the critical current of josephson junctions with f barrier , sfs josephson junctions . in order to avoid excessive depression of the superconducting wavefunction and in order to have well - established superconducting electrodes , the typical structure used to detect the @xmath1shift was made up of relatively thick s  layers ( on the scale of the superconducting coherence length @xmath13 ) , and f  layers of thickness of the order of the ferromagnetic coherence length , @xmath14 ( here , @xmath15 is the diffusion coefficient in the ferromagnet , @xmath16 is the exchange energy and @xmath17 represents the exchange field  in appropriate units  acting on the electron s spins@xcite ) . since @xmath18 is very small ( few nanometers ) in strong ferromagnets ,",
    "weak ferromagnets have been often employed for the ease of controlling the geometrical conditions for the @xmath2 transition .",
    "the sign change of @xmath10 has been experimentally observed in sfs josephson junctions , so that evidence for the @xmath1shift is nowadays robust : measurements of the critical current of sfs junctions with cuni alloys as f ",
    "barrier@xcite showed @xmath2 crossover as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the subtle role of the temperature @xmath8 has been revealed : only in the vicinity of the so - called critical thickness condition ( @xmath19 ) can the temperature trigger the @xmath2 crossover.@xcite also , the @xmath1shift was observed in sfs junctions with pdni f ",
    "barrier@xcite with @xmath20 , even if the transition could not be driven by the temperature in the latter case .",
    "so , sfs josephson junctions with cuni alloys as f  layer remain the only example of temperature mediated @xmath2 crossover .    aim of this work is to assess the _ thermodynamic _ nature of the @xmath2 transition : while the crossover clearly exists in the _ relative phase between two superconducting electrodes _",
    ", no evidence for the change of the _ order parameter _ @xmath21 of the macroscopic wavefunction has been brought forward : the finding of a change in @xmath21 at the @xmath2 transition would be a direct evidence for the thermodynamic nature of such a transition . in particular , the temperature dependence of the amplitude of the order parameter at the critical thickness has not been studied neither theoretically nor experimentally : measurements of the london penetration depth in nb / ni bilayers ( hybrids based on a strong ferromagnet ) as a function of the ni layer thickness@xcite showed only the @xmath7 dependence of the extrapolated zero - temperature superfluid density , similarly to single-@xmath22 estimates in nb / pdni / nb structures,@xcite with no reported temperature dependence .",
    "we are interested in measuring the temperature dependence of the amplitude of the _ overall _ macroscopic wavefunction .",
    "this aim imposes constraints on the geometrical structure under investigation : while in previous experiments@xcite the superconducting electrodes were thick enough so that the influence of the @xmath2 transition on the s - layers superconducting wavefunction @xmath10 was negligible , here thin s  layer will be more suited .",

    "we perform measurements of the temperature dependence of the effective london penetration depth , @xmath23 , in @xmath3 trilayers with relatively small @xmath24 . in the sample with @xmath25 , close to the critical thickness",
    ", we observe a reentrant jump in the @xmath23 curve : @xmath26 increases with lowering temperature , i.e. the superfluid density decreases , a strong experimental evidence of temperature mediated @xmath2 transition . as expected , this phenomenon is absent in trilayers with different values of @xmath7 . in agreement with the experimental data ,",
    "the theoretical analysis predicts the upward jump of @xmath27 as the temperature decreases providing a qualitative description of the observed phenomenon .",
    "nb / pd@xmath28ni@xmath29/nb trilayers were grown on @xmath30 substrates by ultrahigh vacuum dc diode magnetron sputtering at an ar pressure of @xmath31 torr after obtaining a base pressure of @xmath32 torr following the procedure described in ref .",
    ": the samples were all prepared in the same deposition run thanks to the presence of a movable shutter in the deposition chamber which selectively covers the substrates , glued by silver paste on the holder , which were kept at room temperature during the deposition process .",
    "the typical deposition rates were 0.28 nm / s for nb and 0.40 nm / s for pd@xmath28ni@xmath29 measured by a quartz crystal monitor previously calibrated by low - angle x - ray reflectivity measurements on deliberately deposited thin films of each material .",
    "the nb layers have the same nominal thickness in all the samples of the series , @xmath33 nm , while the thickness of the pd@xmath28ni@xmath29 layer changes from @xmath34 nm to 9 nm ( the range where we expect @xmath35 ) .",
    "the total thickness of the trilayers is then @xmath36 .",
    "a pure nb film with @xmath37 nm was also grown for comparison ( labelled in the following with @xmath38 nm ) .",
    "it has a superconducting critical temperature @xmath39 k and @xmath40 nm ( here @xmath41 is the diffusion coefficient in the superconductor).@xcite estimates of @xmath42 14 mev and @xmath43 3 nm for the @xmath44 alloy have been reported elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the complete electrical characterization of s / f / s trilayers has been previously reported in refs . .",
    "high - resolution transmission electron microscopy showed excellent crystallinity of the nb layers , roughness at the sf interfaces less than 1 nm , leading to good interface transparency , and suggested some interdiffusion of nb into the pdni layer.@xcite in a previous study,@xcite the local atomic structure was investigated to assess whether the f  layer could induce significant disorder in the s  layers .",
    "to this aim , extended x - ray absorption spectroscopy at the nb k - edge was performed .",
    "the results did not show correlations between the structural disorder in the nb layer and the superconducting properties , such as @xmath45 , @xmath46 and the microwave results described in the following .",
    "microwave measurements were performed using the dielectric resonator technique.@xcite the quantity experimentally measured is the resonant frequency @xmath47 of the resonator incorporating the sample .",
    "the sample was placed as an end wall in a cylindrical dielectric - loaded resonator .",
    "the resonant frequency of the resonator @xmath47 depends on the energy of the electromagnetic field stored in the volumes of the resonator and of the sample portion where the screening of the field , occurring on a length scale @xmath26 , is not complete .",
    "since the empty resonator gave no additional temperature dependencies in the small temperature range here explored , the resonant frequency of the resonator @xmath48 changed only as a consequence of the change of the sample screening .",
    "thus , the experimentally accessible quantity is the temperature variation of the effective penetration depth with respect to a given temperature @xmath49 , @xmath50 , which is obtained from @xmath47 through the relation : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is a calculated geometrical factor .",
    "the microwave assembly was placed in a @xmath54he cryostat where temperatures down to 2.8 k were reachable .",
    "the cylindrical resonator was loaded with a rutile ( tio@xmath55 ) cylinder , with negligible temperature dependence of the complex permittivity below 10 k. the resonant mode chosen was the te@xmath56 , with circular induced currents on the sample . a magnetic field up to @xmath57",
    "0.7 t ould be applied perpendicular to the sample plane .",
    "the setup has been extensively described previously.@xcite    since the total thickness @xmath58 of the s / f / s structure is smaller than the penetration depth , the london penetration length and the losses ( see below ) are averaged over the whole sample . in this full - penetration regime one has for the effective penetration depth:@xcite @xmath59 the measured @xmath60 directly compares to the square of the superconducting parameter through @xmath61 .",
    "note that due to the small thickness of the f - layer and to the fact that its conductivity is smaller than that of the nb layers,@xcite its contribution to the averaged london penetration depth is negligible .",
    "it is also important to stress that the resonant mode used ( te@xmath56 ) induces only in - plane microwave currents : no current across the sf boundaries are involved and , as a consequence , @xmath60 is related only to the superconducting order parameter @xmath21 , without contributions from tunnelling between layers . in the mixed state , the microwave currents set in motion the quantized flux lines which then contribute to the field attenuation ( losses ) and screening .",
    "the simultaneous measurement of the resonator quality factor and resonant frequency allows to determine the vortex resistivity @xmath62 , related to the forces acting on the quantized flux lines and ultimately to the vortex pinning constant @xmath63 ( see below ) .",
    "raw data for the resonant frequency are reported in fig.2a , for the samples with @xmath64 , 2 , and 8 nm .",
    "the flattening of @xmath47 close to @xmath45 is due to the loss of sensitivity when the samples become nearly electromagnetically transparent , and it is not relevant for the present purposes .",
    "the raw data show ( i ) that for @xmath65 nm the temperature dependence of the screening is smoothened with respect to pure nb , and ( ii ) that the sample with @xmath34 nm exhibits a nonmonotonous temperature dependence of the screening .",
    "this last effect is the main experimental result of this paper , and we will concentrate on it in the following .",
    "the data of fig.2a were converted to @xmath27 , and plotted as a function of the reduced temperature , @xmath66 in fig.2b . in order to have the same reference reduced temperature , @xmath67 , for all the samples , different @xmath49 had to be set .",
    "it is evident that nb ( @xmath64 ) and the sample @xmath68 8 nm do not show any significant feature .",
    "focussing on the sample with @xmath34 nm , the temperature dependence of @xmath60 can be divided in two regimes .",
    "close to @xmath45 it is more similar to the one of the nb film , while as @xmath8 is lowered it shows a jump upward , followed by a smoother behaviour , similar to what shown by the sample with @xmath65 nm . the data have not been scaled vertically : the crossover between the two different regimes is unambiguous .",
    "it is worth to stress that the upward jump of the screening with decreasing @xmath8 implies the _ decrease _ of the superfluid density , that is of @xmath21 , with decreasing temperature .",
    "this nonmonotonous , reentrant behaviour is clearly the most striking result , and thus it must be thoroughly checked .",
    "the check for reproducibility was performed by repeating the measurements after disassembling and reassembling the resonator and the sample holder . while the absolute @xmath47 changed ( as it is expected ) ,",
    "the temperature shift yielded identical results .",
    "the results are reported in fig.2c , where we show the full temperature range accessible , and they show that the two measurement sets superimpose exactly , thus excluding experimental artifacts .    , incorporating different samples with @xmath64 , 2 , and 8 nm .",
    "the screening vanishes when the critical temperature is approached .",
    "a peak is evident in the sample with @xmath34 nm , showing nonmonotonous screening .",
    "the data for the sample with @xmath65 nm have been shifted downward by 4 mhz for clarity .",
    "the flat part at the superconducting transition is not a saturation , but the region where the resonator loses sensitivity .",
    "( b ) effective penetration depth @xmath69 for the same samples , obtained with @xmath70 . with @xmath34 nm ,",
    "the crossover at @xmath71 between two different regimes , corresponding to a _ decrease _ of the superfluid fraction with decreasing temperature , is evident .",
    "( c ) reproducibility test of the peak in @xmath23 after disassembling and reassembling the resonator ( empty symbols ) .",
    "full symbols , original data.,width=8 ]    since the reentrant superconducting superfluid is a very relevant result , we estimated @xmath72 in a different experiment .",
    "we applied a magnetic field @xmath73 perpendicular to the sample plane , thus entering the mixed state of the superconducting structure .",
    "then , quantized flux lines are pinned by defects , which exert a recalling force ( per unit length ) that can be assumed to be elastic as a first approximation ( small displacements @xmath74 ) : @xmath75 , where @xmath63 is the vortex pinning constant .",
    "since @xmath63 ultimately depends on the energy gain of the vortex sitting on a defect , as a crude approximation @xmath76 is connected to @xmath63 by the approximate equality between elastic and condensation energy:@xcite @xmath77 ( @xmath78 is a constant of order unity ) .",
    "using for the thermodynamic critical field @xmath79 one finds : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the flux quantum .",
    "the upper critical field @xmath46 is obtained from dc resistivity or from the disappearance of the field - dependent microwave signal.@xcite the pinning constant @xmath63 is easily obtained from microwave measurements of the magnetic field dependent vortex ",

    "with the support of thorough theoretical calculations , we argue in the following that the observed reentrant jump in the superfluid density is a thermodynamic manifestation of the temperature - induced @xmath2 transition . in order to explain the experimental results , we aimed at calculating the effect of the @xmath2 crossover on the superfluid density of an f  layer sandwiched between two s  layers . in particular , two main issues",
    "were of interest : ( i ) assessing the existence of a double transition with lowering the temperature , first in the @xmath4state and , at lower temperatures , in the @xmath12state and , most important , that ( ii ) the superfluid density in the @xmath12state was smaller than in the @xmath4state , around the transition .",
    "the theoretical model adopted for the calculations should be able to incorporate the main experimental features .",
    "the model is set up as follows .",
    "since the f  layer is a weak ferromagnet we use the usadel equations@xcite for the averaged anomalous green s functions @xmath95 and @xmath96 for the f and s  regions , respectively ( see ref .   for details ) .",
    "the presence of magnetic disorder ( always present in magnetic alloys , and responsible for the main mechanism of the temperature induced @xmath2 transition@xcite ) was taken into account with the introduction of the magnetic scattering rate @xmath97 .",
    "thin s  layers ( @xmath98 ) were introduced and yielded a nearly constant order parameter in the s  layers .",
    "we assumed transparent interfaces .",
    "we expect that the main correction in case of nonideal interfaces is a reduction of the effective f thickness due to some interdiffusion processes .",
    "we first note that in practice the exchange field @xmath17 acting on the electron s spins in the ferromagnet and the magnetic scattering rate @xmath97 are much larger than the superconducting critical temperature .",
    "second , the assumption of transparent interfaces yields the boundary conditions@xcite at @xmath99 : @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the normal - state conductivities of the f and s  metals . applying the method developed in ref .  , we find the solution of the non - linear usadel equation in the f  layer near the superconducting critical temperature obtaining the self - consistency equation for the superconducting order parameter @xmath10 , which in turn yields the expansion of the free energy near the critical temperature . for the @xmath0-state ( @xmath1-state ) we should choose the even ( odd ) anomalous green s functions @xmath95 . as a result",
    "we obtain the expansion of the free energy @xmath103 in the @xmath0 or @xmath1states ( indicated by the superscript ) near the critical temperature as well as the critical temperatures @xmath104 of the two states , and the stable state is then determined .",

    "the critical temperatures @xmath104 of the transitions into @xmath4 or @xmath12 states are given by the expressions:@xcite @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the digamma function , and @xmath111 is the depairing parameter : @xmath112 with @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",

    "<S> in structures made up of alternating superconducting and ferromagnet layers ( s / f / s heterostructures ) , it is known that the macroscopic quantum wavefunction of the ground state changes its phase difference across the f  layer from @xmath0 to @xmath1 under certain temperature and geometrical conditions , whence the name  @xmath2 \" for this crossover . </S>",
    "<S> we present here a joint experimental and theoretical demonstration that the @xmath2 is a true thermodynamic phase transition : microwave measurements of the temperature dependence of the london penetration depth in @xmath3 trilayers reveal a sudden , unusual decrease of the density of the superconducting condensate ( square modulus of the macroscopic quantum wavefunction ) with decreasing temperature , which is predicted by the theory here developed as a transition from the @xmath4 to the @xmath5state . our result for the jump of the amplitude of the order parameter is the first thermodynamic manifestation of such temperature - driven quantum transition . </S>"
