    "recently , gravitational waves ( gws ) were directly detected by ligo as the first event gw150914 from a binary black hole merger @xcite and subsequently as the second event gw151226 @xcite .",
    "these discoveries open gw astronomy and thus attract more attention not only to binary black holes but also to other gw sources .",
    "a stochastic gravitational wave background ( sgwb ) is one of the most interesting targets of gws .",
    "its origin can be divided into a cosmological one or an astrophysical one .",
    "the former is the isotropic primordial gw produced in the very early universe and carries to us information that is unavailable by light .",
    "the latter is the superposition of a large number of unresolved sources such as binary black holes @xcite and contains valuable information for astrophysics .    to date",
    ", a number of observations have been performed to set the upper limits on the sgwb .",
    "big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and matter power spectra @xcite constrained the cosmological sgwb integrated over all frequencies . since these results have no information about the frequency dependence and do not contain the astrophysical sgwb , it is also necessary to search the sgwb at each frequency band . in the low frequency ranges ( below @xmath7 ) , the upper limit was set by cobe @xcite , pulsar timing @xcite and doppler tracking of the cassini spacecraft @xcite . in the middle frequency",
    "ranges ( @xmath8 ) , the upper limit was set by earth s normal mode oscillation @xcite , seismic measurements of the earth and the moon @xcite , gps @xcite , and torsion - bar antennas ( tobas ) @xcite . in the high frequency ranges ( above @xmath9 )",
    ", experiments were performed by ligo and virgo @xcite , two ligo hanford detectors ( h1 and h2 ) @xcite , cryogenic resonant bars @xcite , and a pair of synchronous interferometers @xcite . in the frequency range of @xmath10",
    ", however , the sgwb has yet to be searched mainly because of the difficulty of seismic vibration isolation for ground - based detectors .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the first search for the sgwb at @xmath0 using the observation data of our upgraded toba @xcite , which , compared with our previous toba @xcite , has improved the seismic vibration isolation at around @xmath11 by active and passive isolation systems .",

    "a toba @xcite is a ground - based gw detector designed for the detection of low - frequency gws with two orthogonal test masses , which are rotated by the tidal force of the incident gws ( see fig .",
    "[ toba ] ) .",
    "the angular fluctuation @xmath13 of the test masses obeys the equation of motion @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the moment of inertia , @xmath16 is the damping constant , @xmath17 is the spring constant , @xmath18 is the amplitude of the gw , and @xmath19 is the quadrupole moment of the test mass . in fourier space , this equation",
    "can be reduced to @xmath20 above the rotational resonant frequency @xmath21 , where a tilde denotes the fourier amplitude . because the resonant frequency of torsion pendulum can be on the order of @xmath7 , a toba fundamentally has sensitivity in the low frequency ranges ( above @xmath7 ) .",
    "bisides , the low resonant frequency allows us to easily suppress the effect of the rotational seismic vibration , which is considered to be originally small .",
    "we have reported experimental results on toba in previous papers .",
    "the first prototype composed of a single @xmath22 test mass was constructed for its principle verification @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity was at the level of @xmath23 in the frequency range of @xmath24 , which was limited by seismic noise coupling ( above @xmath25 ) and magnetic noise ( below @xmath25 ) . in order to reduce the seismic coupling ,",
    "active and passive vibration isolation systems were introduced into the upgraded toba ( phase - ii toba ) @xcite , leading to the improvement of the sensitivity mainly at around @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , the phase - ii toba has three independent outputs of one horizontal rotation @xmath26 and two vertical rotations @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where the indices 1 and 2 stand for the test mass @xmath29 and test mass @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "this multi - output system improves the angular resolution for short - duration gw signals in the case of a single detector @xcite .",
    "the phase - ii toba is composed of two @xmath31 test masses , with the rotational resonant frequencies of @xmath25 .",
    "displacements at the edges of the test masses are monitored by interferometeric sensors . in order to keep the sensors within their linear ranges ,",
    "the test masses are feedback controlled by using coil - magnet actuators .    using the phase - ii toba",
    ", we performed a 24-hour observation run from 8:50 utc , december 10 , 2014 to 8:50 utc , december 11 , 2014 , in tokyo ( 35@xmath324249.0``n , 139@xmath324547.0''e ) .",
    "the spectral density of gw equivalent strain amplitude that is derived from the horizontal rotation is shown in fig .",

    "the sensitivity was at the level of @xmath33 in most of the range between @xmath34 .",
    "the spectral densities of the vertical rotations are not shown , since their sensitivities are two orders of magnitude larger than that of the horizontal @xcite .",

    "a target of this work is to set an upper limit on the sgwb .",
    "searches for the sgwb have often been performed by using a cross - correlation analysis with several detectors @xcite , which allows the extraction of the signal of the sgwb out of the much larger noise background of the detectors . in our case , however , the cross - correlation analysis is unable to be adopted since we have only one detector .",
    "still , setting the upper limit is possible without distinguishing the signal and the noise , which is valid even if all of the data were derived from the sgwb .",
    "the energy density spectrum of the sgwb @xmath36 is defined as @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the energy density contained in the frequency interval @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the critical energy density required to close the universe . in the definition of @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the speed of light , @xmath43 is the hubble constant , and @xmath44 is the gravitational constant . assuming that the sgwb is isotropic , unpolarized , stationary and gaussian , @xmath45 is related to the observed gw strain amplitude @xmath46 @xcite : @xmath47 where the effect of antenna pattern function of the toba is taken into account . in the following , @xmath48 is used instead of @xmath49 for convenience because the former is independent of the actual hubble constant , where @xmath50 is the normalized hubble constant .",
    "the analysis frequency range was chosen as @xmath0 since this was a part of the most sensitive frequency ranges to @xmath36 ( see fig . [ strain ] ) .",
    "the smallest value of mean gw energy density was @xmath51 at @xmath3 .",
    "the calibration to @xmath45 was done as follows .",
    "the recorded 24-hour raw data @xmath52 , which were error signals in the control systems , were divided into @xmath53 segments @xmath54 of @xmath55 with @xmath56 overlap , where @xmath57 denotes the @xmath58 segment .",
    "this segment length was chosen so that higher frequency resolution ( @xmath59 ) and sufficient statistics could be obtained in the analysis frequency band , following ref @xcite .",
    "each segment @xmath54 was independently fourier transformed into @xmath60 by the use of the fast - fourier - transform .",
    "then it was converted into the gw equivalent strain amplitude @xmath61 . here",
    "@xmath44 is the open loop transfer function of the control loop , @xmath62 is the transfer function estimated from mass shape from the gw amplitude to the displacement at the sensing point , and @xmath15 is the transfer function of the sensor from the displacement to the voltage .",
    "the time series of the energy density of sgwb @xmath63 was obtained according to eq.([sgwb ] ) .     at @xmath3 .",

    "the solid line is the result of a least - squares fit to the data that are included only within the range of the inset . as a result",
    ", we obtain the bayesian upper limit of @xmath67 . ]",
    "we set two types of upper limit on @xmath45 .",
    "one is the upper limit based on the frequentist probability . at each frequency , this upper limit @xmath68 at the @xmath65 confidence level is determined as the value below which @xmath65 of the data are contained : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the probability distribution of @xmath71 . at @xmath3 where the most stringent value is obtained , for example , the distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ frequentist ] .",
    "since the number of segment is @xmath53 , the @xmath65 point corresponds to the @xmath72-th value of @xmath73 .",
    "the error is the @xmath74 standard deviation .    the other is the upper limit based on the bayesian statistics ( @xmath75 ) . in this analysis ,",
    "we derive to what extent the observation data could explain the distributions in case a certain value @xmath76 is assumed . the rate @xmath77 at which the data can not explain the assumed distributions is defined as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the threshold determined by the observation data distribution and @xmath80 is the probability distribution of @xmath45 if the sgwb with the mean value of @xmath81 exists .",
    "then the bayesian upper limit at @xmath65 confidence level is obtained as the assumed value of @xmath82 .",
    "although there is arbitrariness in the choice of @xmath79 , we adopted the @xmath65 point of the observation data distribution , which is the same as the frequentist upper limit .",
    "@xmath80 is obtained by the signal injection into the observation data .",
    "first , gaussian noises that have the same length as the observation data are made , divided into segments and fourier transformed in the same manner as the analysis of the observation data .",
    "each segment is normalized so that the mean power of the noise is @xmath83 .",
    "then it is converted into strain , adding to each segment of the observation strain data .",
    "the distribution of the resulting data is @xmath80 .    at each frequency , we changed the injection value of @xmath83 and calculated @xmath77 for five times . at @xmath3 , for example , the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ baysian ] .",
    "the data points and the error bars show the averages and the standard deviations , respectively . in this case , the bayesian upper limit is @xmath67 .",
    "this error comes from the statistical ( fitting ) error .",
    "the systematic errors arise from the calibration .",
    "the main errors are the uncertainties of the efficiencies of the sensors , which is @xmath84 . including other small fractions and assuming that they are independent , the total systematic errors are estimated to be @xmath85 .    taking the statistical errors and the systematic errors into account",
    ", we finally obtained conservative upper limits , which means that positive signs are adopted for both errors .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ ul_list_table ] . at @xmath3 ,",
    "for example , the final upper limits are @xmath86 and @xmath87 .     at the @xmath65 confidence level .",

    "our new results and the current upper limits in other frequency bands are shown in fig .",
    "[ ul_list ] . compared with the upper limits below @xmath11 next to our analysis bands , the results of the phase - ii toba are much greater than that of the seismic measurement of the moon , which is the most stringent upper limit at @xmath24 .",
    "however , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , further search for the sgwb by using such seismic mesurements is difficult unless seismometers are set on other quieter planets than the moon . on the other hand",
    ", a toba has a potential to be further upgraded .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath88 at @xmath24 will be realized by the final configuration of a toba with @xmath89-scale bars @xcite .",
    "it is expected to be able to search the sgwb beyond the bbn limit @xmath90 , with a one - year cross - correlation analysis by a pair of two final tobas .    in our results , @xmath91 are roughly @xmath92 times greater than @xmath93 although both analyses should lead to essentially similar results .",
    "this is because we have a single detector and a single data set . in this case , the output of the detector and the injection signals are indistinguishable .",
    "therefore to extract the injection signals from the summed data , the injection signals are inevitably greater than the original detector s output .",
    "we performed the search for the sgwb using the observation data of the phase - ii toba . as a result",
