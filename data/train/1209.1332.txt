    "it so happens that the relative error @xmath83 given by hovers at a bit more than fifteen percent for jumps in tangential angle of magnitudes less than about @xmath84 , showing little variation in this range but growing large outside it .",
    "the jumps are such as to bend the end piece further away from the bulk piece s straight @xmath51 configuration .",
    "a shallow minimum in error occurs for one such kinked pseudosolution that has a tangent discontinuity of about @xmath85 radian .",
    "two types of splicing are presented in the figures : a continuous tangent pseudosolution , and one with a kink of @xmath86 radian , both with @xmath87 .",
    "all examples shown consist of a unit length string , and use @xmath88 for simplicity . stresses and curvatures at one instant are shown in figure [ sigmaandkappa ] .",
    "if tangents are made continuous at the splice point , the curvature there diverges .",
    "the stress is continuous at @xmath51 , but not at other times .",
    "earlier , a presumed continuity in stress was invoked to explain why strings with free ends must have time - dependent configurations . yet",
    "our pseudosolution has a stress discontinuity",
    ". one might wonder whether we should have simply attempted to splice a constant - nonzero - stress lariat solution to a zero - stress end solution .",
    "however , for some @xmath53 with time - dependent tangents @xmath89 , one can not satisfy the jump condition with @xmath90 and the corresponding constant @xmath91 .",
    "one could , of course , introduce large errors into the end solution , but we have been able to keep the error within a reasonable bound here .",
    "one might also wonder why we do nt simply splice two straight strings together to find a solution .",
    "if such a simple approach worked , perhaps it could be extended to multiple strings and , thus , a piecewise approximation to any curve . in appendix",
    "[ straight ] , we show that splicing two straight pieces does lead to an exact solution , but a rather unphysical one that also has singularities in velocity and tension at the point of reflection . using a different jump condition , an inelastic assumption , and even more severe restrictions on the geometry , bernstein , hall , and",
    "trent @xcite also found discontinuous expressions with velocity and tension singularities .",
    "uniform velocities may be added to any result . as @xmath92 , @xmath93 ,",
    "which motion along @xmath94 may be subtracted out from a favored point for convenience .",
    "figure [ sym ] shows snapshots of the configurations , along with the trajectories of the splice points , for the continuous and kinked examples using the pseudosolution @xmath95 the differences between continuous and kinked are subtle , and the overall angular phase shifts of both curves are @xmath96 .    adding a velocity along @xmath97 breaks the symmetry of the patterns .",
    "figure [ pull ] shows a continuous tangent example in which the end segment is made to move along itself at early times , by using the pseudosolution @xmath98 this example approximately mimics the twin conditions of horizontal pulling at moderate @xmath50 and tangential motion of the free end near small @xmath50 , a bit like the physical situation of pulling a chain initially wrapped around an obstacle @xcite .",
    "curved that is , generic solutions to the string equations with one free and one moving end must have a time - dependent shape .",
    "our attempt to find such a solution in two dimensions began with the purely pragmatic assumption of time - independent stress , which led to a conservation law form for the equations .",
    "a new solution emerged , exact but with a time - dependent range of validity .",
    "this was extended to the free end by @xmath99 splicing to another exact but geometrically trivial solution , the result being an error in the complete pseudosolution which could be kept on the order of 15% for moderate jumps in angle at the splice point .",
    "this led to a @xmath0 scaling for the propagation of information the location of the splice point to and from the end of the string , and a corresponding @xmath1 singularity in acceleration .",
    "the singularity is suggestive of the rapid change in direction of the end segment observed in real systems .    though it is not a solution , our pseudosolution is less geometrically restricted than prior @xcite and current ( appendix [ straight ] ) efforts that splice two straight segments together , and avoids the presumably unphysical associated singularities in velocity and tension .",
    "thus , we may hope that it reflects more information about the real physical system .",
    "its construction leaves the bulk portion of the solution exact , and satisfies the jump condition at the internal boundary .",
    "however , once the splicing is performed , the formerly exact end portion is no longer a solution , and only approaches a solution in an uninteresting limit .",
    "there likely exists an exact end solution , consisting of some time - dependent curve whose form we do not currently know , that could be spliced to the bulk solution without errors .",
    "there are likely also solutions that do not require splicing of any sort , for which both tangents and stress are continuous , but our results suggest that these will require time - dependent stress in the bulk .",
    "it is not clear how general the present results are .",
    "there is no reason why the stress should be constant in time in the bulk , or why the end of the string should be treated as straight .",
    "the time scalings found here may result from the details of these assumptions . an important question is whether the effects of the boundary can be localized near the end , or if information really must propagate out from and back into the bulk . also open",
    "is the question of whether bulk solutions may approach a generic lariat condition of uniform stress , or if the effects of the boundary are truly long - range in this sense as well . at large @xmath50 ,",
    "the bulk solution found does not saturate to a uniform value and , even worse , the curvature goes to zero .",
    "it might also be remarked here that , after all our trouble , the curved bulk solutions are not really all that far from straight , and we were further unable to introduce acute angles at the splice point without significant errors .",
    "future work will consider traveling wave _ anstze _ for both stress and curvature in an attempt to find a more useful variety of solutions .",
    "work on this problem was inspired by observations made by j .-",
    "c . gminard and e. hamm and subsequent discussions with them .",
    "brun and d. vella shared their unpublished results on a related problem and provided helpful insights .",

    "equations and indicate that @xmath100 the first of these is just a kinematical truth following from the definition of curvature as the arc length derivative of the tangential angle .",
    "the second says that the mass density @xmath9 times the total stress - weighted angular acceleration over the length of the string is equal to the difference in a quantity @xmath101 at the two ends .",
    "other conservation laws for rods were discussed in @xcite .",
    "let s consider splicing two straight strings together .",

    "<S> we will find that , at least for our treatment of the problem , this time - dependence will take the form of a shape propagating towards and reflecting off of the free end . </S>",
    "<S> the motion of a free end during wave reflection can be quite complicated , even in the linear regime @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the related problems of whip cracking @xcite , fly casting @xcite , and chains with one fixed and one falling end @xcite have been treated approximately by various investigators . the problem is also likely related to that of deployment from a dense pile @xcite , where stresses drop rapidly , being strongly screened by curvature .    </S>",
    "<S> we also wish to call attention to the phenomenological similarity between the boundary - condition - imposed requirement of end motion in an inertial towed string , and the flutter of pipes , garden hoses , and flags tethered to a static support . </S>",
    "<S> whether or not this external similarity reflects a deeper physical connection is not immediately clear . </S>",
    "<S> stresses in tethered structures are thought to arise primarily from drag by an external fluid flow @xcite , with traveling wave instabilities caused by coupling between this flow and the inertia it generates in the structure . in a rapidly towed object , </S>",
    "<S> significant stresses arise from the inertia of the object itself . </S>",
    "<S> this important distinction only becomes obvious when dealing with generic nonlinear geometries , as the shape - independent stresses generated in the bulk by centripetal accelerations due to primarily tangential motion along a relatively steady curve are not present when one considers a perfectly straight string moving along itself at constant speed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our problem is not one that can be treated well by perturbing around a flat shape , as the galilean invariance of inertia makes this limit singular . </S>",
    "<S> it may thus be considered a model problem for geometrically nonlinear approaches . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is well known that the geometrically linearized description of a towed thin object breaks down sufficiently far downstream of the towing point . </S>",
    "<S> for example , dowling @xcite refers to a `` critical point '' on a long towed cylinder where a small - slope description ceases to be valid . </S>",
    "<S> this feature of the geometrically linearized models corresponds to real physical behavior , as evidenced by the use of rope drogues on towed sonar arrays to effectively move the large - slope behavior outside the regions where excessive bending or violent flapping would cause problems with the instrumentation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we also note that moretti @xcite has suggested that inertially - induced tension is important even for tethered objects .    </S>",
    "<S> the unsolved problem addressed in this paper , involving the propagation of a shape along a string and its reflection at a free boundary , is both a basic question in the dynamics of flexible bodies and an important behavioral component of a wide class of industrial and natural systems featuring moving thin objects . </S>",
    "<S> we take preliminary steps towards understanding this problem , by finding a new exact solution for the bulk , and constructing an approximate solution for the entire string that satisfies the free end condition . </S>"
