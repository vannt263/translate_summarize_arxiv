    "these are used , in section  [ section : mf ] , to estimate how the mass function of virialized objects is modified when @xmath2 .",
    "this section also shows the result of comparing these estimates with measurements in simulations . with some care ( e.g.",

    "correlations between the @xmath17 will be very useful in what follows .",
    "these depend on the correlations between @xmath5 and its derivatives but , because @xmath5 is gaussian , they can be computed easily .",
    "doing so shows that the six components of @xmath12 are not independent : although the three off - diagonal terms are not correlated with the others , the three diagonal terms are .",
    "however , if we set @xmath18 then these three parameters , combined with @xmath19 , form a new set of six independent components @xcite . when @xmath1 , then each of these is an independent gaussian random field .",
    "most of the complication in @xmath0 models arises from the fact that we are almost always interested in spatially smoothed quantities .",
    "fortunately , smoothing is a linear operation , and the new variables @xmath20 are just linear combinations of the elements of @xmath12 .",
    "hence , if @xmath21 denotes the fourier transform of the smoothing window of scale @xmath22 , to second order in @xmath0 , @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the cdm transfer function and @xmath27 is the linear growth function . in what follows , the quantity @xmath28 , will play an important role , because it represents the leading order contribution to the non - gaussianity ( note that it is proportional to @xmath0 ) .",

    "if @xmath31 denotes the distribution of @xmath30 when smoothed on scale @xmath22 , then the fact that the other variables have the same distribution as in the case @xmath1 allows one to provide an excellent analytic approximation to the joint distribution of the eigenvalues .",

    "the fundamental reason why this works is that doroshkevich s formula is actually the product of two independent distributions , one of @xmath30 , and the other of a quantity which is a combination of the five other independent elements of the deformation tensor ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since the distribution of each of these other elements is unchanged from the gaussian case ( we just showed that they all have zero skewness ) , this second distribution is unchanged from that of the gaussian case ",
    "the only change is the distribution of @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , this holds for any local mapping @xmath37 ( and is also true for the alignment of the principal axes , see @xcite ) .",
    "one consequence of this is that distributions at fixed @xmath30 are the same as in the gaussian case .",
    "for example , @xmath38 where @xmath39 can take values from 1 to 3 , @xmath40 , and the subscript @xmath41 indicates the distribution associated with gaussian initial conditions , for which @xmath1 .",
    "integrating over one of the eigenvalues in the expression above , e.g. , @xmath42 , yields an expression for the distribution of the other at fixed @xmath30 .",
    "clearly , such expressions will also be the same as in the gaussian case .",
    "hence , @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "because we are interested in small departures from gaussianity , the edgeworth expansion provides a convenient form for the distribution of @xmath30 : @xmath45\\     \\frac{e^{-\\delta^2/2\\sigma^2(r)}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma(r)}\\,{\\rm d}\\delta    = \\left[1 + \\frac{\\sigma s_3}{6}h_3(\\nu)\\right]\\ ,      p_0(\\delta|r)\\ , { \\rm d}\\delta , \\label{eqn : pdfdeltal}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is given by equation  ( [ eqn : variance ] ) , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",

    "the predictions from the ps formalism and the ls formalism ( both without the void - in - cloud effect ) are different over a large range of void size , so comparisons with numerical measurements could distinguish which models describe best the formation of voids .",

    "these two curves , as well as the short - dashed ( blue ) curve , include the scale dependence of @xmath165 using the approximation formula given in @xcite .",

    "the overlapping of the solid ( black ) , dot - long - dashed ( orange ) , and dotted ( red ) curves justifies a posteriori our assumption of constant @xmath165 . for big voids , the dotted curve deviates only slightly from the other two where it agrees reasonably well with higher order solulions to the integral equation  .",
    "hence , the difference between the various curves ( apart from the blue short - dashed ) are mostly governed by @xmath165 rather than the different functional form of the models .",
    "note , however , that the prediction of the ls formalism ( blue short - dashed ) considerably departs from the other curves .    including higher order terms in equation   so as to better account for the void - in - cloud effect does not change the results for big voids .",
    "this is expected from our model in which big voids are unlikely to be embedded in a larger collapsing region .",
    "however , including the void - in - cloud effect modifies the ratio of void abundances for the smallest voids .",
    "namely , a positive @xmath0 tend to decreases the number of small voids .",
    "this may originate from an increase of high mass halos , which is such that small voids are more likely to sit inside an collapsing region .",
    "our prediction is at best qualitative because higher order terms are needed to describe accurately the small voids regime ( our results shown in figure  [ fig : fnu ] indicate that the third order approximation ( magenta ) is valid only for @xmath170 ) .",
    "we have not pursued the inclusion of higher order corrections here since constant barriers may not be a good approximation for the formation of halos and voids as suggested by the analysis of ( gaussian ) initial conditions of cosmological simulations .",
    "nonetheless , our formalism allows the incorporation of scale dependence barriers , which shall be useful when numerical measurements are available .",
    "we extended doroshkevich s celebrated formulae for the eigenvalues of the initial shear field associated with gaussian statistics to the local non - gaussian @xmath0 model .",
    "we showed that , up to second order in @xmath0 , this is straightforward because , at fixed overdensity , the distribution is the same as when @xmath1 ( i.e. , gaussian initial conditions ) .",
    "our analytic formulae are in good agreement with measurements of the distribution of @xmath70 in monte carlo realizations of the @xmath0 distribution ( figures  [ fig : initpdfs ] and  [ fig : initge ] ) .",
    "our extension of doroshkevich s formulae to the local non - gaussian @xmath0 model provides the first step in the study of triaxial structure formation in models with primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "this is interesting because , for gaussian initial conditions , halo formation is more triaxial than spherical . in particular , in the triaxial collapse model , the evolution of a patch depends on its initial overdensity @xmath30 as well as the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath50 , which describe its initial ellipticity and prolateness .",
    "we showed that the distribution of @xmath63 and @xmath50 at fixed @xmath30 is unchanged from when @xmath1 ( equation  [ gepd ] ) .",
    "therefore , equation  ( [ eqn : stbs ] ) , which was determined for @xmath1 models , should continue to be useful even when @xmath2 .",
    "we applied our formulae for the initial shear field to study the change in halo and void abundances in the local non - gaussian model ( section  [ section : mf ] ) . when @xmath1 , halo abundances predicted by a model in which halo formation is associated with having all three initial shear eigenvalues above some critical value are in better agreement with the simulations than those implied by the usual overdensity threshold criterion ( figure  [ fig : mfgau ] ) .",
    "however , the predicted dependence of @xmath171 @xmath0 is in better agreement with the simulations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mfratio ] ) in the latter case .    to understand this better",
    ", we extended the ellipsoidal collapse formalism to the local non - gaussian model .",
    "we included the moving barrier formulation of ellipsoidal collapse @xcite using two different approaches .",
    "the first is analogous to that used in the case of spherical collapse ( section  [ section : halocritical ] ) ; the predicted dependence on @xmath0 did not agree with measurements from the simulations .",
    "the second is an extension of the excursion set approach following @xcite . for the case of a constant barrier ( associated with spherical collapse ) , this approach reproduces the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "its extension to moving barriers appears promising since it matches the measured halo counts when @xmath1 as well as the dependence on @xmath0 ( figure  [ fig : mfratio ] ) .    for @xmath0 models , differences in the density field evolved from gaussian and non - gaussian initial conditions are more dramatic in the underdense regions @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fnu ] shows a number of predictions for void abundances for @xmath1 , while figure  [ fig : vfratio ] shows the effect of using our triaxial formalism to study how these depend on @xmath0 .",
    "the trends are generally like those in the halo abundance , except that the dependence on the sign of @xmath0 is reversed ( compare figures  [ fig : mfratio ] and  [ fig : vfratio ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the recent work of @xcite .",
    "still , one might have expected that an excess of massive halos also implies an excess of large voids ( since all the mass is concentrated in a smaller volume ) .",
    "this is what is indeed found for @xmath1 when one increases the normalisation amplitude @xmath3 of the fluctuation field .",
    "however , this is not true in @xmath0 models . in this respect ,",
    "void abundances provide complementary information to cluster abundances , so a joint comparison of both could be used to put constraints on the level of non - gaussianity .",
    "we also demonstrated how the void - in - cloud effect can be included in models where @xmath167 .",
    "we used the constant barriers as an example .",
    "we found that the inclusion of the void - in - cloud effect modifies the abundances of small voids .",
    "as a result , models with positive @xmath0 show a strong decrement in very small voids whereas models with negative @xmath0 show the opposite .",
    "this may due to the enhancement of high mass halos for @xmath172 which effectively increases the probability of finding small voids inside a high mass halo .",
    "higher order terms in equation   and a more accurate description of scale dependent barriers will be needed to make more quantitative predictions .",
    "our results have other applications which we have not completed .",
    "the distribution of the eigenvalues of the initial shear field can be used to study the shapes of halos and voids ; combining the signals with the halo / void abundance and shape distribution would further constrain the value of @xmath0 .",
    "this is a subtle point because , although halo shapes are expected to correlate with the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath50 , we have shown that , at fixed @xmath30 , the distribution of @xmath63 and @xmath50 does not depend on @xmath0 .",
    "hence , naively , the shape distribution is not informative . in practice",
    ", one usually averages over a range of halo masses .",
    "in other words , these will have a range of @xmath173 values , so the result of this averaging may depend on @xmath0 , for the same reason that the distribution of @xmath63 ( equation  [ ge ] ) depends on @xmath0 . and finally , we are in the process of extending our nonlinear redshift space probability distribution function for the dark matter @xcite to these @xmath0 models .",
