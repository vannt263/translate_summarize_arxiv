    "the negatively charged nitrogen - vacancy ( nv@xmath0 ) centre is a remarkable point defect in diamond @xcite that is at the frontier of quantum technology . in particular",
    ", the nv@xmath0 centre has many exciting applications as a highly sensitive quantum sensor in nano - metrology , including magnetometry @xcite , electrometry @xcite , thermometry @xcite , piezometry @xcite , and gyroscopy @xcite .",
    "high sensitivity is principally achieved by the long - lived coherence of the centre s electron spin , which persists in ambient and extreme conditions @xcite .",
    "nanoscale sensing is enabled by the atomic size of the nv@xmath0 centre , its bright fluorescence that allows single centres to be located with nano - resolution and its mechanism of optical spin - polarization/ readout that allows the magnetic resonance of its electron spin to be optically detected @xcite .",
    "single nv@xmath0 centres have demonstrated the ability for three - dimensional vector sensing of electric fields @xcite with single fundamental charge sensitivity @xcite .",
    "nv@xmath0 electrometry is achieved by observing the spin resonances as an applied magnetic field is rotated .",
    "each vector component of the unknown electric field can be determined from its combined effect with the applied magnetic field , as long as the precise orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the defect structure of the nv@xmath0 centre is known .",
    "the latter requirement has not yet been fulfilled and , as a consequence , complete nv@xmath0 vector electrometry has not been possible . in principle ,",
    "vector magnetic field sensing could also be achieved using a single nv@xmath0 centre by an analogous technique , where an applied electric field is rotated in place of an applied magnetic field , but this is yet to be demonstrated . whilst vector magnetic field sensing has been demonstrated using an ensemble of at least four differently orientated nv@xmath0 centres @xcite , a demonstration using a single nv@xmath0 centre is likely to have several advantages due to the superior spin coherence of the single centre and its potential for greater spatial resolution . here , we describe a technique for the measurement of the defect structure orientation of a single nv@xmath0 centre relative to applied electric/ magnetic fields , which is key to the realization of high - sensitivity nv@xmath0 vector sensing .",
    "more generally , this technique will also prove useful for material science because it is prototypical for measuring the defect structure of spin defects with trigonal symmetry , such as ( hh ) or ( kk ) divacancies in silicon carbide @xcite .",
    "the ability to precisely characterise which orientations of nv@xmath0 centres are formed as the result of different fabrication methods will provide an invaluable tool to the study of the nv@xmath0 growth mechanisms @xcite .",
    "such detailed knowledge of the growth mechanisms can be used to improve the fabrication of homogeneous ensembles of nv@xmath0 centres , within which all centres are aligned and therefore can be more effectively employed in hybrid quantum devices ( e.g. coupled superconducting resonators and nv@xmath0 spin ensembles @xcite ) . measuring the structure of a single nv@xmath0 centre also allows for local characterisation of the diamond lattice . in this way",
    ", the structure of nanodiamonds or polycrystalline sectors can be non - invasively determined .",
    "the orientation measurement technique described here may be directly used to realize three - axis rotation sensing using a single nv@xmath0 centre .",
    "three - axis rotation sensing can be achieved in two different geometries ( see figure [ fig : fig2 ] ) : ( 1 ) the nv@xmath0 diamond rotates with respect to a fixed apparatus of electric and magnetic fields or ( 2 ) the apparatus rotates with respect to a fixed nv@xmath0 diamond .",
    "a possible example of the first geometry is the sensing of the rotational dynamics of a nanodiamond within a biological cell @xcite .",
    "an example of the second geometry is a high sensitivity rotation sensor for a micro - mechanical system , where one element of the system is free to rotate with respect to another element that contains a nv@xmath0 diamond .",
    "notably , there has been related proposals of single - axis nv@xmath0 gyroscopy using single centres @xcite and ensembles @xcite .",
    "these proposals differ from the one made here , as they are sensitive to the rotational frequency about a single rotational axis , not the rotational coordinates of a rotation about possibly all three rotational axes .",
    "rotation sensing : ( a ) a fixed apparatus and a rotating nv@xmath0 ( nano- ) diamond , and ( b ) a fixed nv@xmath0 diamond and a rotating apparatus in a micro - mechanical system . in each geometry",
    ", the apparatus contains the necessary elements to generate electric and magnetic fields at the nv@xmath0 centre . ]    in this paper , we demonstrate such a technique for measuring the defect structure orientation of a single nv@xmath0 centre . after further introduction to the properties of the nv@xmath0 centre",
    ", we first derive the relationship between the spin resonances of a nv@xmath0 centre in the presence of combined electric and magnetic fields and its defect structure .",
    "the orientation measurement technique arises naturally form the derivation and we subsequently demonstrate the technique by measuring the defect structure orientation of a single nv@xmath0 centre .",
    "the latter measurement , in essence , mimics our second proposed geometry for rotation sensing . based upon our demonstration",
    ", we finally examine the application of the technique to three - axis rotation sensing using single nv@xmath0 centres .",
    "the nv@xmath0 centre is a @xmath1 point defect in diamond consisting of a substitutional nitrogen atom adjacent to a carbon vacancy trapping an additional electron ( refer to figure [ fig : fig1]a ) .",
    "the orientation of the centre s defect structure is characterised by the directions of its major and minor symmetry axes .",
    "the trigonal structure of the centre has a @xmath2 major symmetry axis that is defined by the direction joining the nitrogen and vacancy . for a given crystal orientation ,",
    "the centre s [ 111 ] major symmetry axis has four possible alignments ( see figure [ fig : fig1]b ) .",
    "the centre s minor symmetry axis is defined as being orthogonal to its major symmetry axis and also contained within one of the centre s three reflection planes ( eg . @xmath3 $ ] ) , which corresponds to the direction joining a point on the centre s major symmetry axis and one of the vacancy s nearest neighbour carbon atoms .",
    "considering an isolated single nv@xmath0 centre , if the alignment of its major symmetry axis is known ( i.e. via magnetic field alignment ) , then even with knowledge of the crystal orientation , the orientation of the centre s defect structure is not fully determined .",
    "as depicted in figure [ fig : fig3]a , the one - electron orbital level structure of the nv@xmath0 centre contains three defect orbital levels ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "epr observations and _ ab initio _ calculations indicate that these defect orbitals are highly localized to the centre @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3]b shows the centre s many - electron electronic structure generated by the occupation of the three defect orbitals by four electrons @xcite , including the zero phonon line ( zpl ) energies of the optical ( 1.945 ev/637 nm ) @xcite and infrared ( 1.190 ev/1042 nm ) @xcite transitions .",
    "the energy separations of the spin triplet and singlet levels ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) are unknown .",
    "as depicted in the inset of figure [ fig : fig3]b , the ground @xmath9 level exhibits a zero field fine structure splitting between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 spin sub - levels of @xmath12 ghz , which is principally due to first - order electron spin - spin interaction @xcite .",
    "the spin quantization axis is thus defined by the trigonal unpaired electron spin density distribution of the ground @xmath9 level to be parallel to the centre s major symmetry axis .",
    "spin - orbit and spin - spin mixing of the @xmath9 and @xmath13 levels makes the @xmath9 fine structure susceptible to electric fields , yet does not significantly perturb the g - factor of the spin magnetic interaction from its free electron value @xcite .",
    "a detailed derivation of the spin - hamiltonian that describes the @xmath9 fine structure in the presence of electric and magnetic fields has been previously reported @xcite .",
    "the spin - hamiltonian derived in @xcite is @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the @xmath16 dimensionless electron spin operators , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the bohr magneton , @xmath19 is the electron g - factor @xcite , @xmath20 is the planck constant , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the magnetic and electric fields , respectively , and @xmath23khz @xmath24m / v and @xmath25khz @xmath24m / v are the electric susceptibility parameters @xcite .",
    "although the spin - hamiltonian derivation in @xcite is detailed , there is limited discussion of the relationship between the spin - hamiltonian and the defect structure of the nv@xmath0 centre , in particular , the physical basis for the adopted coordinate system and the behaviour of the spin - hamiltonian under coordinate transformations .",
    "consequently , we present a brief review of the spin - hamiltonian derivation in appendix a. the derivation proceeds by the application of perturbation theory to the fine structure interactions of the nv@xmath0 centre and ends in the definition of each of the spin - hamiltonian parameters in terms of integrals of the centre s orbital wavefunctions . the key outcome of the review is the identification of the implicit coordinate system definition in ( [ eq : spinhamiltonian ] ) as the choice of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 coordinate axes as being directed along the centre s major and minor symmetry axes , respectively , such that the electric susceptibility parameters are positive . as demonstrated in appendix b ,",
    "a simple molecular orbital argument can be applied to the evaluation of the orbital integrals of the electric susceptibility parameters to show that they are positive when the @xmath26 coordinate axis is directed from the nitrogen towards the vacancy and when the @xmath27 coordinate axis is directed from the @xmath26 coordinate axis towards one of the vacancy s three nearest - neighbour carbons ( see figure [ fig : fig1]a ) .",
    "since there are three equivalent choices of the @xmath27 coordinate direction due to the centre s trigonal symmetry , the spin - hamiltonian ( [ eq : spinhamiltonian ] ) is invariant under @xmath28 rotations about the major symmetry axis .",
    "having established the relationship between the spin - hamiltonian and the centre s defect structure , we now discuss the orientation dependence of the centre s observable spin resonances in the presence of electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the zero - field spin states @xmath29 ( defined by @xmath30 spin - projection ) are mixed in the presence of electric and magnetic fields to form a new state basis @xmath31 ( refer to figure [ fig : fig3]b ) @xcite .",
    "the frequencies @xmath32 of the @xmath33 spin transitions are @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . note that the validity of the above expression is constrained by the conditions @xmath43 .",
    "in the presence of either an electric or a magnetic field , the spin frequencies reduce to @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in each case , the spin frequencies depend on the alignment of the electric / magnetic field with the centre s major symmetry axis ( i.e. @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) , but do not depend on the transverse orientation of the electric/ magnetic field ( i.e. @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) .",
    "this invariance to the transverse orientation of an individual field is due to the equal spin susceptibility to @xmath27 and @xmath53 field components , which is itself a consequence of the centre s trigonal symmetry .",
    "if the electric/ magnetic field is near alignment to the centre s major symmetry axis , the spin frequencies obtain their maximum/ minimum values , such that @xmath54 which may be used as a condition to identify the orientation of the symmetry axis .",
    "however , noting that @xmath55 , it can not be determined whether the magnetic field is parallel ( @xmath56 ) or anti - parallel ( @xmath57 ) with the @xmath26 coordinate axis .",
    "this is not the case for the electric field , where the observable sign of the common shift @xmath58 is directly dependent on whether the electric field is parallel or anti - parallel with the @xmath26 coordinate axis .",
    "hence , whilst either electric or magnetic fields can be used to determine the orientation of the centre s major symmetry axis , only an electric field can differentiate the precise direction of the centre s @xmath26 coordinate axis .",
    "this conclusion forms the basis of a technique for measuring the orientation of the @xmath26 coordinate axis ( refer to figure [ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "since the magnetic susceptibility of the ground state spin is much greater than its electric susceptibility , the most sensitive method is to first rotate a known magnetic field until it is aligned with the centre s major symmetry axis and then apply a parallel electric field to determine the direction of the @xmath26 coordinate axis .",
    "although the electric field shift @xmath58 is typically small , as long as it can be detected , it will be sufficient because only its sign is relevant .     and",
    "@xmath22 ) are oriented ( except for misalignment angle @xmath59 ) parallel ( a ) or anti - parallel ( b ) to the nv major symmetry axis .",
    "( c , d ) the response of the spin transitions frequency @xmath60 does not depend on the parallel or anti - parallel orientation of the magnetic field ( c ) but it does depend on the electric field orientation ( d ) . ]",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq : spinfrequencies ] ) , that the spin frequencies become dependent on the transverse orientations of electric and magnetic fields if they are simultaneously applied .",
    "this dependence obtains a maximum when the fields are transverse to the major symmetry axis @xmath61 where the approximation in the second line has been taken in the limit @xmath62 , which is relevant to typical experimental conditions @xcite . for an explanation of the transverse susceptibility see appendix a.    since the second term of ( [ eq : transversespinfreq ] ) leads to a splitting of the @xmath32 spin frequencies that is independent of the transverse field orientations , the variations of the spin frequencies as the fields are rotated",
    "may be individually observed and are governed by the third term , such that @xmath63 figure [ fig : fig5 ] depicts @xmath64 for the cases where the orientation of one field is fixed and the other is rotated . as discussed in the demonstrations of nv@xmath0 vector electrometry @xcite and single charge detection @xcite , the mixed argument of the cosine function implies that to determine the transverse orientation of an unknown electric field by observing @xmath60 as a transverse magnetic field is rotated , one requires knowledge of the orientation of the transverse magnetic field with respect to the centre s coordinate system ( i.e. @xmath52 ) .",
    "the opposite is also true for the measurement of the transverse orientation of an unknown magnetic field via a rotation of a transverse electric field .",
    "this interdependence motivates the simultaneous rotation of transverse electric and magnetic fields as a means to determine the transverse orientation of the centre s coordinate system/ defect structure .    - and @xmath65- ) field orientation dependence of @xmath60 : ( a ) @xmath52 increased and @xmath66 fixed , ( b ) @xmath51 increased and @xmath67 fixed , ( c ) @xmath68 increased and @xmath69 fixed , and ( d ) @xmath70 increased and @xmath71 fixed . using different values for the fixed angles would simply rotate the patterns according to equations ( [ eq : delta_f_pm_e_b ] ) and([eq : delta_f_pm_gamma_delta ] ) . ]    defining the combined electric - magnetic field angles @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the orientation dependence of the spin frequencies become @xmath74 if @xmath70 is fixed whilst @xmath68 is varied by the fields being simultaneously rotated in the same direction at the same rate , the variation of @xmath60 ( see figure [ fig : fig5 ] ) immediately reveals the trigonal structure of the nv@xmath0 centre .",
    "indeed , if the fields are parallel , such that @xmath69 , the three maxima of @xmath60 directly correspond to when the fields are directed along the three equivalent @xmath27 coordinate axes of the centre ( i.e. the directions from the major symmetry axis to the vacancy s three nearest - neighbour carbons ) .     is observed .",
    "( b ) the observed trigonal pattern of @xmath60 directly corresponds to the centre s trigonal defect structure . ]",
    "this conclusion forms the basis of a technique for measuring the orientation of the @xmath27 coordinate axis ( refer to figure [ fig : fig6 ] ) .",
    "having first determined the orientation of the centre s major symmetry axis @xmath26 using the technique discussed previously , parallel electric and magnetic fields can be aligned such that they are transverse to the @xmath26-axis .",
    "if the fields are rotated together as above , the direction of the @xmath27 coordinate axis can be identified as the field direction corresponding to one of the three maxima of @xmath60 .",
    "in this section we present a proof - of - principle demonstration of the orientation measurement technique .",
    "we performed odmr measurements on an as - grown single nv@xmath0 centre in a bulk cvd diamond sample with a @xmath75 orientated surface .",
    "we independently verified the crystallographic directions by x - ray diffraction .",

    "please note that our modified spin - echo sequence is sensitive to the sign of the accumulated phase and therefore the direction of energy level shifts . ]",
    "the dependence of @xmath60 on the orientation of the transverse electric and magnetic fields was observed using a modified spin - echo odmr pulse sequence ( see figure [ fig : fig7]b ) . in the modified sequence ,",
    "the last @xmath77-pulse is phase - shifted by @xmath83 to the other two pulses to enable the measurement of the sign of the accumulated phase ( i.e. the direction of the energy level shift ) .",
    "the microwave pulses were separated by a fixed delay time @xmath84 @xmath24s , during which the transverse electric field was applied with a sinusoidal magnitude @xmath85 .",
    "the application of the electric field during the pulse sequence results in a net accumulated phase difference @xmath86 between @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which is converted into an optically detectable population difference between the spin states by the final @xmath77-pulse .     under four distinct rotation conditions of the transverse electric and magnetic fields ( experimental data - points , theory - solid lines ) : ( a ) @xmath52 rotated and @xmath66 fixed , ( b ) @xmath51 rotated and @xmath67 fixed , ( c ) @xmath68 rotated and @xmath69 fixed , and ( d ) @xmath70 rotated and @xmath71 fixed .",
    "note that the `` two - leaf '' pattern of ( a ) differs from the `` four - leaf '' pattern observed in the previous electrometry demonstrations @xcite because our measurements were sensitive to both the sign and magnitude of @xmath60 . ]",
    "figure [ fig : fig8 ] depicts the observed behaviour of @xmath60 for the three distinct rotations of the transverse electric and magnetic fields . in each case , the measurements agree well with the theoretical prediction and any small differences can be explained by small deviations of the fields from transverse alignment as they are rotated . the strength of the measured electric field could be calculated to @xmath89v@xmath24m@xmath90 for the maximum applied voltage of @xmath91 v , which compares to a simulated electric field strength of @xmath92v@xmath24m@xmath90 for such a quadrupole structure , depending on the exact position of the nv centre within the structure . as discussed in the previous section , because the electric and magnetic fields are parallel ( @xmath69 ) , the trigonal pattern of figure [ fig : fig8]c directly corresponds to the orientation of the centre s trigonal defect structure and would be shifted by @xmath93 for a differently oriented nv .",
    "epr and crystallographic results concerning the direction of the minor symmetry axis coincide within the error margins .",
    "the proposed concept of three - axis rotation sensing using a single nv@xmath0 centre is to employ the orientation measurement technique to measure the orientations of the centre s @xmath27 and @xmath26 coordinate axes at discrete intervals ( refer to figure [ fig : fig9 ] ) . from the discrete set of coordinate orientation measurements @xmath94 , the three - axis rotations @xmath95 that occurred during each time interval , such that @xmath96 and @xmath97 , can be reconstructed using @xmath98\\times[\\vec{x}(t_{i+1})-\\vec{x}(t_i ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ \\cos\\beta_i & = & \\vec{x}(t_{i+1})\\cdot\\vec{x}(t_{i})+\\vec{z}(t_{i+1})\\cdot\\vec{z}(t_{i})+[\\vec{x}(t_{i+1})\\cdot\\vec{x}(t_{i})][\\vec{z}(t_{i+1})\\cdot\\vec{z}(t_{i})]\\nonumber \\\\ & & -[\\vec{x}(t_{i})\\cdot\\vec{z}(t_{i+1})][\\vec{z}(t_{i})\\cdot\\vec{x}(t_{i+1})]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the axis and angle of the rotations .",
    "note that the rotational dynamics are assumed to be slow enough such that there is no appreciable rotation during each orientation measurement .",
    "given an apparatus where the direction of the parallel fields are precisely known with respect to a chosen reference frame , the accuracy of the orientation measurements will thus be determined by the sensitivity of the odmr signal to misalignment of the fields .",

    "the critical characteristic of our rotation sensing proposal is the average time @xmath107 required to perform an orientation measurement , which depends on the the average number of odmr measurements for achieving a sufficient angle estimate for each axis and the relevant coherence time @xmath108 that determines the time of each odmr measurement .",
    "nv@xmath0 quantum sensing is performed via the measurement of spin frequencies using odmr pulse sequences , such as the ramsey , spin - echo and more advanced dynamical decoupling sequences .",
    "in essence , during a pulse sequence a coherent superposition of two spin states ( e.g. @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) acquires a phase with a certain frequency .",

    "s , this corresponds to an angular accuracy of 0.02 @xmath127 , which compares favourably to a previous single - axis rotational sensing demonstration where the rotational dynamics of a nanodiamond within a biological cell were @xmath128 deg/ hour @xcite .",

    "it is clear that since three - axis rotational sensing enables the rotational dynamics of a nanodiamond to be almost completely reconstructed , the technique proposed here may have significant applications in the study of the internal mechanics of biological cells .",

    "since it was shown in @xcite that only interactions between the triplet levels perturb the ground state fine structure , the ground state spin - hamiltonian may be immediately constructed to second - order in terms of orbital integrals as @xmath146 where @xmath147 ev is the energy separation of the triplet levels and it is to be understood that the spin operators of @xmath148 that remain after the evaluation of the orbital integrals act upon the triplet spin states @xmath141 .",
    "the above expression demonstrates that @xmath149 is @xmath1 symmetric , since its behaviour under a coordinate transformation will be determined by the behaviour of the @xmath1 symmetric orbital wavefunctions .",
    "evaluating the orbital integrals in the above yields the final expression of the spin - hamiltonian ( [ eq : spinhamiltonian ] ) . introducing the centre s defect orbitals ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , the explicit expressions for the electric susceptibility parameters in the adopted coordinate system are @xcite @xmath150 where @xmath151 are transverse and axial electric dipole moments , @xmath152 is an orbital integral of spin - spin interaction , @xmath153 is the fundamental charge , @xmath154 is the permeability of free space , @xmath155 is the position of the @xmath156 electron , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 and @xmath159 are real spin - coupling coefficients formed from linear combinations of spin - orbit and spin - spin interaction integrals ( refer to @xcite for further details ) .",
    "the above demonstrates that the electric susceptibility parameters are products of the electric dipole and spin - spin interactions between the triplet levels .",
    "consequently , the electric field interaction may be interpreted as resulting in the lowering of the symmetry of the ground state spin density . as discussed in section 2 , whilst the adopted coordinate system is aligned with the centre s symmetry axes , there is still freedom to choose the precise coordinate directions so that electric susceptibility parameters are positive .",
    "since the spin - coupling coefficients are real , and thus @xmath160 , only the electric dipole @xmath161 determines the sign of @xmath162 .",
    "both the spin - spin and electric dipole contributions to @xmath163 determine its sign .",
    "however , notably the spin - spin interaction is invariant to a coordinate inversion because it is quadratic in the coordinates .",
    "it is shown in appendix b that the electric susceptibility parameters are positive for the coordinate system definition depicted in figure [ fig : fig1]a , where the @xmath26 coordinate axis is directed from the nitrogen towards the vacancy and when the @xmath27 coordinate axis is directed from the @xmath26 coordinate axis towards one of the vacancy s three nearest - neighbour carbons .",
    "in this appendix , the well established molecular model of the centre @xcite is drawn upon to perform a molecular orbital calculation of the sign of the electric susceptibility parameters .",
    "similar calculations have been used to establish basic aspects of the temperature and pressure response of the ground state spin @xcite .",
    "the molecular model exploits the highly localized nature of the centre s defect orbitals to approximate the orbitals as linear combinations of the dangling sp@xmath164 atomic orbitals ( @xmath165,@xmath166,@xmath167,@xmath168 ) of the vacancy s nearest neighbor nitrogen and carbon atoms ( refer to figure [ fig : appendixb]a ) @xcite @xmath169 where @xmath170 is a real linear coefficient and @xmath171^{-1/2 } \\nonumber \\\\ n_y & = & [ ( { \\langle c_2 |}-{\\langle c_3 |})({| c_2 \\rangle}-{| c_3 \\rangle})]^{-1/2 } \\nonumber \\\\ n_{a_1 } & = & [ ( { \\langle c_1 |}+{\\langle c_2 |}+{\\langle c_3 |}+\\lambda{\\langle n |})({| c_1 \\rangle}+{| c_2",

    ", we can proceed with simple geometric arguments . for the carbon sp@xmath164 atomic orbitals ,",
    "the expected position @xmath173 ( @xmath174 ) of an electron occupying one of those orbitals occurs at a distance @xmath175 towards the vacancy away from the carbon @xcite .",
    "likewise , the expected position @xmath176 of an electron occupying the nitrogen orbital occurs at a distance @xmath177 towards the vacancy away from the nitrogen .",
    "the distances between the vacancy and the carbon and nitrogen atoms are @xmath178 and @xmath179 , respectively @xcite .",
    "consequently , through inspection of the geometry ( refer to figure [ fig : appendixb]b ) , it is clear that both electric dipole integrals are positive .    unlike the electric dipole",
    "integrals , the spin - spin integral contains two - electron direct integrals between densities of two carbon sp@xmath164 orbitals . for the purpose of determining the sign of the spin - spin integral , the difficulty of evaluating these direct integrals can be avoided and a semi - classical approximation can be performed instead , where the direct integrals between atomic orbitals are replaced by expressions containing the expected positions of the electrons occupying the orbitals @xcite @xmath180 \\nonumber \\\\ & & { { \\langle c_2(\\vec{r}_1)c_3(\\vec{r}_2 ) | } \\frac{x_{12}^2-y_{12}^2}{r_{12}^5 } { | c_2(\\vec{r}_1)c_3(\\vec{r}_2 ) \\rangle } } \\approx \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{1}{|\\langle\\vec{r}\\rangle_3-\\langle\\vec{r}\\rangle_2|^5 } \\left[(\\langle x\\rangle_3-\\langle x\\rangle_2)^2-(\\langle y\\rangle_3-\\langle y\\rangle_2)^2\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using these semi - classical expressions and the geometry of the centre ( refer to figure [ fig : appendixb]c ) , the spin - spin integral becomes @xmath181 which is clearly positive .",
    "given that each of the electric dipole and spin - spin integrals are positive , it follows from ( [ eq : electricparameters ] ) that the electric susceptibility parameters are also positive for the adopted coordinate system .",

    "<S> the negatively charged nitrogen - vacancy ( nv@xmath0 ) centre in diamond has many exciting applications in quantum nano - metrology , including magnetometry , electrometry , thermometry and piezometry . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is possible for a single nv@xmath0 centre to measure the complete three - dimensional vector of the local electric field or the position of a single fundamental charge in ambient conditions . </S>",
    "<S> however , in order to achieve such vector measurements , near complete knowledge of the orientation of the centre s defect structure is required . here , we demonstrate an optically detected magnetic resonance ( odmr ) technique employing rotations of static electric and magnetic fields that precisely determines the orientation of the centre s major and minor trigonal symmetry axes . thus , our technique is an enabler of the centre s existing vector sensing applications and also motivates new applications in multi - axis rotation sensing , nv growth characterization and diamond crystallography . </S>"
