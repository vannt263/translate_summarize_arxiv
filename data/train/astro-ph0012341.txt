    "the number of supernova remnants ( snrs ) with convincing evidence for interaction with ambient molecular clouds has increased considerably in recent years .",
    "the evidence ranges from a simple morphological relation to the detection of broad and/or shock - excited emission lines from various molecules .",
    "although circumstantial evidence could be very suggestive , it is the molecular lines from the shocked gas that are essential for understanding the physical and chemical processes associated with the molecular shock . in this regard , there are still only a few snrs adequate for the study of molecular cloud - shock interaction ; perhaps w28 ( arikawa et al . 1999 ) , w44 ( seta et al .",
    "1998 ) , w51c ( koo & moon 1997 ) , 3c391 ( reach & rho 1996 , 1999 ) , and the classical source ic  443 ( denoyer 1979 ; tauber et al . 1994 and references therein ) .    in this paper , we report the discovery of broad emission lines from the shocked co gas in hb  21 .",
    "hb 21 ( g89.0 + 4.7 ) is one of those snrs with mixed morphology , e.g. , shell - like in radio and center - filled in the x - ray ( rho & petre 1998 ) , where the center - filled , thermal x - ray emission is suggested to be due to interaction with molecular clouds .",
    "it has a nearly complete radio - continuum shell with an angular extent of @xmath9 ( hill 1974 ; tatematsu et al .",
    "1990 , hereafter t90 ) .",
    "the shell is elongated along the northwest - southeast direction .",
    "the brightness distribution of the shell is not uniform , but enhanced in scattered areas .",
    "particularly noticeable features are the v - shaped northern boundary , a @xmath4-sized loop structure in the south central area , and the one in the central region of the eastern boundary ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . optical nebulosity associated with hb  21 has not been detected in h@xmath10 or [ sii ] plates ( van den bergh 1978 ) .",
    "x - ray emission from hb  21 was detected by leahy ( 1987 ) and studied in detail by leahy & aschenbach ( 1996 ) .",
    "the distance to the snr is uncertain .",
    "we adopt 0.8  kpc following t90 , which is the distance to the cyg ob  7 complex ( humphreys 1978 ) .",
    "hb 21 has been a suspect for interaction with molecular clouds based on its radio appearance and the ambient molecular clouds ( erkes & dickel 1969 ; huang & thaddeus 1986 ; t90 ) .",
    "erkes & dickel ( 1969 ) suggested that the distorted boundaries with enhanced radio brightness might be the places where the snr is interacting with dense ambient gas .",
    "huang & thaddeus ( 1986 ) found that the giant molecular cloud associated with cyg ob  7 appears to be partially surrounding hb  21 ( see also dobashi et al .",
    "t90 obtained a higher - resolution ( @xmath11 ) co map of the eastern part of the snr and found that the eastern boundary of the snr appeared to be in contact with molecular and atomic clouds .",
    "they also made a coarsely - sampled map of the regions with enhanced radio emission and detected molecular clumps .",
    "but no direct evidence for the shocked _ molecular _ gas has been detected for hb  21 .",
    "the search for oh masers , which are known to be an indicator for the interaction between a snr and molecular cloud , gave negative results too ( frail et al .",
    "on the other hand , koo & heiles ( 1991 ) detected shocked h  i gas moving at 40 to 120  in the southern part of the snr , although the limited angular resolution ( @xmath12 ) hindered any detailed study of the shocked gas .",
    "we detected broad co emission lines in the northern and southern parts of hb  21 , but not in the eastern part .",
    "we have found no evidence suggesting that the molecular clouds in the eastern part are interacting with the snr , although they appear to be located along the boundary of the snr on the sky .",
    "we summarize the observations and the results of molecular line observations in   2 and   3 , respectively . in   4 .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results on the interaction between the snr and molecular clouds .",
    "  5 summarizes the main results of our paper .",
    "@xmath0co j=21 line observations were carried out using the 12 m telescope of the national radio astronomy observatory at kitt peak in 1999 june and 2000 january .",
    "the fwhm of the telescope at 230  ghz was 27@xmath13 .",
    "we mapped the eastern half ( @xmath1 ) of the snr almost completely using the otf ( on - the - fly ) observing technique .",
    "we used two 256 channel filter banks ; one with 500 khz , and the other with 1  mhz resolution .",
    "we split each filter bank into two sections and observed two linear polarizations simultaneously . the velocity resolution and coverage of the 500  khz filter bank were 0.65  and 83  , while those of the 1  mhz filter bank were two times greater .",
    "typical system temperatures were 350450  k. during the observing run in january 2000 , we had some trouble because of telluric co j=21 emission , which appeared at @xmath145  .",
    "the emission was not cancelled out completely by usual position - switching observation and produced a hill - and - valley feature in spectra , the strength of which depends on elevation .",
    "we were able to avoid the contamination from telluric co emission by averaging out the contaminated velocity channels because the telluric co emission line is narrow ( 0.8  ) and the absolute strength of the ` hill ' and ` valley ' features are equal .",
    "we also obtained sensitive spectra of @xmath6co j=21 , @xmath0co j=10 and j=21 lines toward several peak positions .",
    "for co j=10 observations , we used 1 and 2 mhz filter banks , so that they have the same velocity resolution and coverage with those of co j=21 line observations .",
    "we also used the millimeter autocorrelator ( mac ) for the @xmath0co observations , which provided high resolution ( 0.25  after smoothing ) spectra .",
    "we have converted the observed temperatures ( @xmath15 ) to the main - beam brightness temperatures ( @xmath16 ) using the corrected main - beam efficiency provided by the nrao .",
    "additional observations of @xmath0co and @xmath6co j=10 lines were performed using the taeduk radio astronomy observatory ( trao ) 13.7 m telescope ( hpbw=49@xmath13 at 115 ghz ) in 2000 january and march . an sis receiver equipped with a quasi - optical sideband filter",
    "was used along with a 250 khz , 256-channel filter bank .",
    "the main beam efficiency was 0.41 at 115 ghz ( roh & jung 1999 ) , and the pointing accuracy was better than 10@xmath13 .",
    "typical system temperatures were about 750  k at 115  ghz and 450  k at 110  ghz .",
    "figure  1 shows the distribution of the integrated intensity of co j=21 emission .",
    "the velocity range is between @xmath17  and @xmath18  , which covers most of the emission .",
    "the overlaied contour map shows the 1420  mhz brightness distribution of hb  21 ( t90 ) .",
    "the overall distribution of co gas in figure  1 is not very different from the low - resolution map of t90 . but figure  1 shows much detailed structure because of its high resolution , high sensitivity , and complete sampling .",
    "figure  1 immediately shows that molecular gas is distributed mainly along the boundary of the snr .",
    "( we observed the central area in figure  1 , which had not been covered in our co j=21 observations , in co j=10 line emission , and have detected only several small [ @xmath19 clumps other than some faint extension associated with the clouds in southern and eastern parts of the remnant . ) but the overall distribution has little correlation either with the distortion of snr boundaries or with the distribution of radio brightness ( cf . ",
    "3.2 ) . for the purpose of discussion",
    ", we divide the remnant into three areas ( fig .",
    "2 ) : ( 1 ) eastern area ( ra@xmath20 20@xmath21 47@xmath22 ) where three relatively large ( @xmath23 ) clouds and several filamentary clouds are present , ( 2 ) northern area centered at ( 20@xmath21 46@xmath22 , 51@xmath24 00@xmath25 ) , where a small ( @xmath2 ) , very bright u - shaped cloud is noticeable , and ( 3 ) southern area centered at ( 20@xmath21 44@xmath22 , 49@xmath24 50@xmath25 ) , where clumpy and filamentary clouds with complicated structures are present .",
    "we detected broad ( 2040  ) emission lines from the clouds in the northern and southern areas , which will be discussed in detail in the next sections . in the following ,",
    "we summarize the results on the eastern area .    in the eastern area , there are three clouds centered at declinations @xmath26 49@xmath25 , @xmath27 15@xmath25 , and @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "we call these three clouds by clouds a , b , and c following t90 ( see fig . 2 for the location of these clouds ) . figure  3 shows the channel maps of the eastern area .",
    "the velocity ranges of the channel maps were chosen to show the essential features clearly .",
    "cloud a appears at @xmath30 to @xmath31  and is composed of two velocity components centered at + 6  and @xmath32  , respectively .",
    "the former component ( 6  ) , which is seen in figure  3a , is extended and the emission peaks at the southern part ( @xmath33 45@xmath25 ) of the cloud , while the latter component ( @xmath32  ) , which is seen in figures  3b and 3c , is spatially confined and comprises the northern part of the cloud .",
    "their maximum brightnesses are @xmath34 and 7  k , respectively .",
    "cloud b appears at @xmath35 to @xmath36  and is seen in figures  3c and 3d .",
    "the south central part of the cloud , e.g. , the region between @xmath3717@xmath25 , is bright and appears to be connected to cloud c. cloud c has two components at very different velocities , e.g. , one at + 2 to @xmath38  , which is seen in figures  3c and 3d , and the other at + 17 to + 10  , which is not shown in figure  3 but has a distribution similar to the other velocity component . according to the result of t90",
    ", cloud c extends to @xmath39 .",
    "an interesting feature in figure  3 is the semi - circular loop that appears above cloud b in figure 3b .",
    "the ratio of the minor , which is along the ns direction , to the major axis is 0.8 .",
    "if it is at 0.8  kpc , the linear size of the semimajor axis would be @xmath40  pc .",
    "the velocity increases systematically from both ends to the northern top of the loop , which is consistent with an expanding loop .",
    "the top portion is redshifted with respect to the both ends by @xmath41  .",
    "if we assume that the ellipticity is due to projection , then the expansion velocity would be @xmath42  , so that the dynamical age of the ring is probably shorter than @xmath43  yrs .",
    "this is much greater than the age ( @xmath44  yrs , koo & heiles 1991 , scaled to 0.8  kpc adopted in this paper ) of hb  21 and , therefore , the loop might not be associated with hb  21 .",
    "we suspect that the loop is originated from some energetic phenomena in cloud b. a faint v - shaped structure that connects cloud b and the ends of the loop in figure  3b seems to indicate the association of the two .",
    "the cloud in the northern area is composed of a small ( @xmath2 ) , very bright , u - shaped cloud and several clumps scattered around it ( fig . 1 ; see also fig . 9 for enlarged view ) .",
    "figure  4 shows its velocity structure .",
    "there are several points to be made from figure  4 : first the u - shaped cloud is composed of several clumps , whose central velocities shift systematically from + 3 to @xmath31   as we move from ne to nw along the structure .",
    "the integrated intensity attains a maximum at ( 20@xmath21 46@xmath22 03@xmath45.2 , 51@xmath24 00@xmath25 00@xmath13 ) , which we call hb21:bml - n1 ( broad molecular line  northern position 1 ) , or simply n1 .",
    "second , there are several other clumps in the field . these clumps , except",
    "the one near the southeastern corner at @xmath46  , appear over a wide ( @xmath47  ) velocity range . among them , the one at ( 20@xmath21 45@xmath22 55.@xmath450 , 51@xmath24 03@xmath25 30@xmath13 ) , which we call hb21:bml - n2 ( or n2 ) , appears over the widest ( @xmath48  ) velocity interval .",
    "third , there is a diffuse emission at @xmath49  to the ne of the cloud .",
    "its line is narrow ( 23  ) and it is part of a large ( @xmath50 ) cloud that appears to be connected to cloud a. we consider that the clumps aligned along the ne - sw direction in figure  4 are associated and call them cloud n , i.e. , cloud n does not include the diffuse emission in the northeastern area and the clump in the southeastern corner .",
    "t90 detected in this area only the diffuse molecular gas at @xmath51 to 6  and called it cloud d. )    as can be expected from figure  4 , most clumps in cloud n have broad emission lines . as an example , we show the spectra of n1 and n2 in the top frames in figure  5 , where we see that the spectrum of n1 is box - shaped and its full width ( at zero intensity ) is 30 km / s , while that of n2 is asymmetric and extends from @xmath52 to + 11 km / s . for comparison ,",
    "the spectrum of the diffuse , extended structure in the northeastern part of this area has narrow ( 23  ) emission lines centered at @xmath49  , a sample of which is shown in the right bottom frame in figure  5 .",
    "we have obtained sensitive j=10 and j=21 spectra of @xmath0co and @xmath6co molecules at the two peak positions , n1 and n2 , and figure  5 shows the spectra .",
    "the molecule and transition are marked in each spectrum .",
    "the second spectrum from the top is @xmath0co j=21 emission convolved to the j=10 beam size ( @xmath53 ) to be compared with the j=10 spectra .",
    "the difference between the top and convolved spectra indicates that some velocity components , e.g. , the narrow component centered at + 4  of n1 and the broad component at @xmath54  of n2 , are confined to small areas . by comparing the j=10 and the convolved j=21 spectra",
    ", we notice that the ratio of j=21 to j=10 intensities is high and that it varies over the profile : for n1 , the ratio is between 1.2 and 2.0 in the central parts of the spectrum , while it increases at the wings , e.g. , @xmath55 at + 5  and @xmath5613  . for n2",
    ", the ratio varies between 0.8 and 2.8 , and it is higher between @xmath38  and 0  . the ratios of the @xmath0co j=21 and j=10 integrated intensities @xmath57 are 1.6 and 1.7 for n1 and n2 , respectively . the @xmath6co j=21 line is clearly detected toward n1 , while it is marginally detected toward n2 .",
    "for n1 , the line has double peaks centered at + 1 and @xmath36 , while the @xmath0co j=21 line profile toward n1 is composed of several narrow peaks .",
    "the narrow peaks might indicate that the emission is from several , unresolved subclumps .",
    "presumably , the @xmath6co emission might be from these subclumps too , which is not apparent in the profile in figure  5 because of low signal - to - noise ratio and low velocity resolution .",
    "( note that the velocity resolutions of the @xmath0co j=2 - 1 and @xmath6co j=2 - 1 lines are 0.25 and 0.68  , respectively . )",
    "the ratios of @xmath0co j=21 to @xmath6co j=21 integrated line intensities @xmath58 are @xmath59 and @xmath60 for n1 and n2 , respectively .",
    "( the errors are statistical errors . )",
    "table  1 summarizes the line parameters of the peak positions , i.e. , their coordinate , velocity range ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) , co j=21 peak brightness temperature @xmath63 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and the ratio of @xmath0co j=10 to @xmath6co j=10 integrated line intensities @xmath64 .",
    "the detailed line diagnostics based on the observed line parameters in table  1 is discussed in   3.4 .      in the southern part of the snr ,",
    "the emission is detected at @xmath65 to @xmath66  .",
    "the velocity structure is shown in figure  6 . at positive velocities ,",
    "we see several clouds with narrow lines come and go , e.g. , a diffuse cloud that extends @xmath67 along the ns direction centered at ( 20@xmath21 44@xmath22.5 , 50@xmath24 00@xmath25 ) between @xmath68 and + 5  . the co distribution at negative velocities is fairly complicated : the distribution is filamentary , and small ( @xmath5 or 0.3  pc ) , bright clumps are seen along the filamentary structure .",
    "the filamentary structure , which we call cloud s , appears to form a loop of @xmath69 in extent , elongated along the ns direction .",
    "the eastern part of the loop is particularly clumpy and has a semicircular shape ( see the channel map centered at @xmath70  ) .",
    "the clumps generally have broad ( @xmath71  ) lines . among them , three clumps marked by crosses in figure  6 have broadest ( 3040  ) lines and we show the @xmath0co j=21 and j=10 spectra at their peak positions , which we call s1 , s2 , and s3 from east to west ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , in figure  7 .",
    "again we show the convolved j=21 spectra together , although the line shapes do not change significantly by convolution toward these peak positions .",
    "we have obtained some sensitive j=10 and j=21 spectra of @xmath0co and @xmath6co molecules at these peak positions , and the line parameters are listed in table  1 . note that @xmath57(=1.72.3 ) and @xmath72 toward s1 ) are similar to those of northern positions , while @xmath64 s , although they have large uncertainties , appear to be much greater than that of n1 .",
    "the broad co lines are presumably emitted from the shocked gas , where physical parameters vary greatly over a short distance scale .",
    "but still it would be worthwhile to estimate their excitation parameters based on elementary considerations .",
    "first , the observed @xmath7340 are significantly less than either the average ratio ( @xmath74 ; langer 1997 ) of @xmath0c/@xmath6c in the solar neighborhood or the terrestrial value ( 89 ) , implying that the @xmath0co j=21 lines are _ not _ optically thin .",
    "if we adopt @xmath0c/@xmath6c=67 and assume that the emission is thermalized , then the optical depth for the @xmath0co j=21 line @xmath753.4 .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath64(@xmath76 ) close to or greater than the terrestrial value imply that @xmath0co j=10 lines are optically thin , except at n1 where j=10 and j=21 lines appear to have comparable optical depths .",
    "this , however , is not conclusive because of large uncertainties associated with @xmath64 .",
    "second , the large values of @xmath772.3 imply that the broad - line emitting region is warm and dense . for typical molecular clouds , where the j=2 level is subthermally excited ,",
    "the ratio is usually less than unity .",
    "for example , molecular clouds in the local arm exhibit ratios ranging from 0.53 ( taurus ) to 0.75 ( orion a ) ( sakamoto et al . 1994 , 1997 ) .",
    "our spectra of ambient gas also show this , e.g. , see the spectra toward s2 in fig .",
    "7 where the narrow component at + 2  has @xmath78 .",
    "but the large ratio is common for the shocked molecular gas in snrs ( see   4.1 ) .",
    "third , the low ( @xmath79  k ) brightness temperature of j=21 lines , regardless of their moderate optical depths , imply that the emitting region must be clumpy , i.e. , composed of subclumps , and the emission is beam - diluted . from the above considerations , we may conclude that the broad emission lines are from warm , dense clumps with significant column densities so that the 21 lines are optically thick .",
    "we have applied the large - velocity - gradient ( lvg ) model ( scoville & solomon 1974 ; goldreich & kwan 1974 ) to our broad co lines in order to derive their excitation parameters .",
    "the model assumes an uniform , spherical cloud with a constant velocity gradient ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "if the lines are emitted from the shocked region where temperature and density vary greatly , the resulting parameters may be considered as ` average ' values . since we have found that the emission is beam - diluted , we have used the line ratios , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , instead of brightness temperatures to determine the excitation parameters . according to our lvg analysis ,",
    "the observed ratios are possible for @xmath81  k. figure 8a shows the result of our model computations when @xmath82  k , where curves of constant @xmath57 and constant @xmath58 are drawn in ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) plane .",
    "@xmath83 is the fractional abundance of @xmath0co relative to h@xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) per unit velocity gradient interval .",
    "the asterisks ( * ) mark the observed ratios toward the peak positions where both ratios are obtained , i.e. , n1 , n2 , and s1 . according to figure  8a , @xmath87@xmath88  @xmath89 and @xmath90@xmath91 pc  ( ) @xmath92  at the three peak positions .",
    "there are multiple choices for n1 , e.g. , the same ratios are obtainable when @xmath93  @xmath89 and @xmath94 pc  ( ) @xmath92 .",
    "we adopt the lower density because it is comparable to the densities in the other peak positions and because the density of @xmath95  @xmath89 appears to be too high for the co emission to explore .",
    "if the temperature becomes higher , both @xmath84 and @xmath83 need to be greater .    in figure 8b , we plot the _ expected _ co j=21 radiation temperature @xmath96 $ ] which is just the brightness temperature when @xmath97 and the expected @xmath64 from the same lvg model .",
    "note that the expected radiation temperatures are much greater than the observed main - beam brightness temperature .",
    "we have estimated beam filling factors of ( 7.78.8)@xmath98 from the ratio of these two brightnesses .",
    "we have estimated the co column densities @xmath99@xmath100  @xmath101 at these peak positions by @xmath102 \\delta v$ ] , where @xmath10318  is the velocity width .",
    "the excitation parameters derived from the lvg analysis are listed in table  2 .",
    "note that the @xmath64 expected from the lvg model differ from the observed ones : at n1 , the observed value is small by a factor of 2 , while , at s1 , it is large by a factor of @xmath104 . considering the weakness of @xmath6co j=10 lines and various uncertainties associated with different telescopes , however , it is not obvious if this difference is critical .",
    "we have made a crude estimate of the mass of the broad - line clouds as follows .",
    "if the co j=10 line emission is optically thin , then @xmath105 can be obtained from the co j=10 luminosity @xmath106 by @xmath107 $ ] where @xmath108 is the fraction of co molecules at @xmath109 level and the other coefficients have their usual meanings . in our case ,",
    "co j=10 emission has less optical depth than the j=21 emission , but is not very optically thin , so that the above formula might yield an underestimate .",
    "what we have is the luminosity of co j=21 emission @xmath110 , which has moderate optical depth .",
    "but , since @xmath772.3 at the peak positions , we may obtain @xmath106 by assuming that @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are co @xmath11410 and @xmath11421 line frequencies respectively .",
    "finally we assume @xmath115 , which is a mean value of those ( 0.150.26 ) at the three peak positions obtained from the lvg analysis .",
    "we have found that the h@xmath85 masses of clouds n and s are @xmath116  and @xmath117  , respectively .",
    "the mass of the central u - shaped part of cloud n is @xmath118  while the masses of the small clumps in cloud s are @xmath1191  .",
    "broad co emission lines with large @xmath57 in clouds n and s strongly suggest that they are being shocked . the observed velocity width is as large as @xmath120  .",
    "note that , toward this direction ( @xmath121 ) , the lsr velocity permitted by the galactic rotation is @xmath122  , so that it is not impossible for broad lines to be produced by molecular clouds accidentaly aligned along the line of sight .",
    "but it is highly improbable that such alignment ( over a few kpcs ) occurs in very small ( 12@xmath25 ) areas on the sky .",
    "we also searched for protostellar candidates around the broad line emitting regions using the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) point source catalog , because broad lines can be emitted from the high - velocity gas associated with protostellar object too .",
    "we did not find any suspicious sources except one , iras 20444 + 4954 , which is located close to the s2 clump , i.e. , at ( @xmath123 , @xmath124 ) from the peak position in table  1 .",
    "the source has been detected in two iras wavebands , i.e. , 60 and 100  @xmath125 , with flux densities of @xmath126  jy and @xmath127  jy .",
    "we have found that the source is located within a small ( @xmath128 ) , bright ( @xmath129  k ) co j=21 core at @xmath130  , so that it might be a young stellar object associated with the @xmath67-sized , diffuse cloud in the northern part of the + 2.9  map in figure  6 , not with the s2 clump .",
    "also the velocity of the s2 clump is similar to those of the other fast - moving clumps in this area , which suggests that they have the common origin .",
    "therefore , the broad lines that we detected are almost certainly from the fast - moving molecular gas swept - up by the snr shock in hb  21 .    another indication that the broad co lines are from the shocked gas is their high @xmath772.3 . as we have shown in   3.4",
    ", the high ratio implies that the emitting gas is warm and dense , which might be manifestation of shock .",
    "indeed high @xmath57 is a common property of the broad lines from the shocked molecular gas in snrs : all six snrs that are known to have broad molecular emission lines , i.e. , w28 ( arikawa et al . 1999 ) , 3c391 ( reach & rho 1999 ) , w44 ( seta et al .",
    "1998 ) , w51c ( koo & moon 1997 ) , hb  21 ( this paper ) , and ic  443 ( e.g. , van dishoeck et al . 1993 ) , have ratios greater than 1 , which implies that the broad co lines in these snrs are all emitted from warm and dense , shocked gas",
    ". meanwhile , the maximum brightness temperature ( @xmath131  k ) of co j=21 line in hb  21 is significantly less than those of other snrs even if it was obtained with a higher spatial resolution ( 0.1  pc ) , e.g. , it is 33  k for w28 ( reach & rho 2000b ) and ic  443 ( van dishoeck et al . 1993 ) when observed with a resolution of 0.2  pc .",
    "the much smaller co j=21 brightness temperature with comparable @xmath57 imply that either the shocked gas in hb  21 is composed of much smaller clumps or is less dense .    on a large scale ,",
    "hb  21 appears to be in contact with a giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) along its eastern boundary ( huang & thaddeus 1986 ; tatematsu et al .",
    "the gmc is 130  pc@xmath13270  pc in extent ( dobashi et al .",
    "1994 ) , and the structure that we call clouds a , b , and c defines the western boundary of the gmc .",

    ", they concluded that clouds b and c might not , because there is no indication of the interaction in the distribution of radio brightness . according to our high - resolution observations ,",
    "however , there is little relationship between the boundaries of cloud a and the snr . instead",
    ", since the velocity of the ambient molecular gas around hb  21 might be negative ( see   4.3 ) , we consider that clouds b and c have a better chance of interaction .",
    "but we have detected broad co lines toward none of these eastern clouds .",
    "even if a snr is interacting with a molecular cloud , the broad lines may be absent , however .",
    "3c  391 ( g31.9 + 0.0 ) , which appears to be located at the edge of a large molecular cloud , for example , has no broad co lines along the interface ( wilner , reynolds , & moffett 1998 ; reach & rho 1999 ) .",
    "but strong [ oi ] 63  @xmath133 m emission has been detected near the interface , which indicates that the snr is interacting with the molecular cloud ( reach & rho 1996 ) .",
    "this would happen if the shock is dissociative and molecules have not reformed .",
    "figure  9 shows an enlarged view of the northern area overlaied with a 325  mhz radio continuum map of the snr .",
    "note that there is an enhanced radio continuum emission elongated along the ne - sw direction in the central area .",
    "its peak position falls exactly inside the u - shaped part of cloud n. the positional coincidence suggests that the enhancement is possibly associated with cloud n. we have derived a spectral index ( flux@xmath134 ) of @xmath135 for the radio emission associated with the u - shaped central part using the 325  mhz and 1420  mhz maps .",
    "the derived index has a large uncertainty because of the confusing  background \" level , but it appears to be flatter than the mean spectral index @xmath136 of hb  21 ( willis 1973 ) . for cloud s , there is no obvious correlation between the co emission and radio continuum brightness , although the radio continuum appears to be bright around the cloud in general .",
    "it is not obvious , observationally or theoretically , what determines whether or not radio synchrotron emission becomes enhanced when sn shock hits a dense cloud .",
    "observationally , we see very limited correlation between radio continuum brightness and shocked molecular gas in some snrs , i.e. , the shocked molecular gas is not usually associated with radio continuum enhancement and vice versa ( see also chevalier 1999 ) . in ic  443 , for example , shocked molecular gas is distributed in a fragmentary , flattened , ring , which partly overlaps with the radio continuum shell ( e.g. , see dickman et al .",
    "1992 for the shocked molecular gas and green 1986 for the radio continuum ) .",
    "but the radio continuum is brightest in the northeastern part of the shell where there is no shocked molecular gas , and the radio continuum is not particularly bright toward the shocked molecular gas , perhaps except around the southern part of the molecular ring ( see next ) . in 3c  391",
    ", there is a shocked molecular clump in the southern part of the snr , but there is only a faint , local radio continuum peak at @xmath137  pc apart from the shocked clump , whose association can not be confirmed ( reach & rho 1999 ) . in w28 , on the other hand , there is a ridge of radio continuum emission associated with the shocked molecular gas ( arikawa et al .",
    "theoretically , it could be either the dense cloud or the surrounding intercloud medium where synchrotron emission becomes enhanced .",
    "if the shock propagating through the dense cloud is radiative , there will be a large compression of cosmic rays and magnetic field , which would increase the synchrotron emissivity ( van der lann 1962 ; blandford & cowie 1982 ) .",
    "but this mechanism may not work because the molecular shocks in old snrs are not ionizing shocks and , therefore , high energy particles may escape from the shocked region ( draine & mckee 1993 ; chevalier 1999 ) . on the other hand , the shocked intercloud medium surrounding the cloud , particularly the medium behind the cloud , could have enhanced synchrotron emissivity because of the increased magnetic field strength there ( e.g. , jones & kang 1993 ; mac low et al .",
    "1994 ) . in hb  21 , the peak of the enhanced radio emission is located behind the shocked cloud ( fig .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the cloud has a u - shape , which is similar to what we would expect when a small cloud is swept up by a strong shock ( e.g. , klein , mckee , & colella 1994 ; mac low et al .",
    "these morphological characteristics seem to suggest that the enhanced emission is not physically associated with the shocked cloud but with the shocked surrounding intercloud medium .    in some respects ,",
    "the region around cloud n in hb  21 is similar to the flat ( @xmath138 ) spectral region in ic  443 , which is also located behind a shocked molecular cloud ( green 1986 ; keohane et al .",
    "1997 ) . in ic  443 , keohane",
    "( 1997 ) found that the flat spectral region is particularly bright in hard x - rays , which are most likely due to synchrotron radiation .",
    "they concluded that the enhanced hard x - ray emission and the flat spectral index is due to shock acceleration of cosmic rays behind dense clouds .",
    "more observational study is certainly needed for hb  21 in order to reveal the relationship between the northern u - shaped cloud and the enhanced radio emission .",
    "cold molecular gas around hb  21 in general has central velocities between @xmath139  and + 6  , which must be the velocity range of the preshock gas . in the areas where",
    "broad lines have been detected , there is diffuse molecular gas at positive ( 0 to + 5  ) velocities ( see figures 4 and 6 ) .",
    "if this gas represents the preshock gas , then , since the broad lines are centered and spread out mostly at negative velocities , the gas should have been shocked and accelerated toward us _",
    "systematically_. if we take + 3  as the velocity of the preshock gas and if we take either the central or peak positions of the broad lines as the systematic velocities of the shocked gas , then _ the line - of - sight _ velocities of the shock would be @xmath140  and @xmath8  for clouds n and s , respectively . and , if we take @xmath141 and @xmath142 ( @xmath143=the radius of the snr ) as their projected distances from the center of the snr , then their deprojected velocities are @xmath144  and @xmath145  , respectively .",
    "such coasting clumps are indeed theoretically expected for the old snrs such as hb  21 : molecular clumps swept up by a snr blast wave are accelerated by the shock propagating into the clumps and also by the ram pressure of interclump gas ( e.g. mckee 1988 ) .",
    "the characteristic timescale for acceleration is @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the radius of the clump , which becomes @xmath148  yrs ( @xmath149  yrs ) for the clumps in hb  21 using @xmath150  pc and @xmath15125  .",
    "the wings of the broad lines may be attributed to the gas accelerated by shocks propagating from sides .",
    "but one difficulty in this scenario would be that there is no clear correlation in the distributions of the broad lines between the preshock and postshock gases . in the southern area , for example , the preshock gas ( 23  component ) is distributed in a filamentary cloud extended along the ns direction , while the broad - line emitting clumps are distributed over a much wider area to the sw of this cloud .",
    "also it appears rather awkward that there are no broad lines centered near the velocity of the preshock gas .",
    "alternatively , it could be the molecular gas at negative velocities that is associated with the snr , and , in the northern and southern areas , most , if not all , of the ambient gas may have been shocked . in this picture ,",
    "the shocked gas may be coasting too , but not necessarily at high speeds because the velocity of the preshock gas is somewhere within the velocity range of the broad lines , e.g. , near the velocity of the peak .",
    "the shock velocity determined from the line width is @xmath8  . between the two possible interpretations , we prefer the latter because of the difficulty with the former mentioned above .",
    "but , since the difference in the shock velocities between the two interpretations is @xmath140  , the following discussion remains valid basically even if the velocity of the preshock gas is 0 to + 5  .",
    "( the derived properties of the shocked gas in   3.4 should remain valid too in either case because the emission from the preshock gas might be in narrow lines and its contribution to the integrated intensity of broad lines is expected to be small . )    the _ observed _ shock velocity is @xmath8  .",
    "this is less that the critical velocity for the dissociation of molecules , which is 2550  depending on preshock density and magnetic field strength ( hollenbach & mckee 1980 ; draine , roberge , & dalgarno 1983 ) .",
    "hence , the shock might be a _",
    "non - dissociating c - shock_. the observed integrated intensity of the co j=21 emission is ( 39)@xmath152  ergs @xmath101 s@xmath92 sr@xmath92 at the peak positions . if we consider the beam dilution (   3.4 ) , the actual surface brightness may be greater by an order of magnitude , e.g. , ( 410)@xmath153  ergs @xmath101 s@xmath92 sr@xmath92 .",
    "this is much larger than the _ angle - averaged _ surface brightness predicted from shock model computations .",
    "draine & roberge ( 1984 ) , for example , computed surface brightnesses expected for steady - state c - shocks propagating through molecular gas with different preshock conditions . according to their result , the angle - averaged surface brightness of co j=21 emission varies from @xmath154 to @xmath155  ergs @xmath101 s@xmath92 sr@xmath92 for a 1020  shock propagating through a molecular cloud with @xmath156 to @xmath157  @xmath89 .",

    "the results are summarized in table  3 . the far - infrared color ratio , @xmath182 , for clouds a , b , and c is almost identical to that of diffuse cirrus clouds in the solar neighborhood ( boulanger & prault 1988 ) .",
    "this suggests that the infrared emission from clouds a , b , and c is most likely due to dust heated at the surface of the molecular clouds by the interstellar radiation field ; specifically , it suggests that the infrared emission is not related to shock fronts into the clouds . on the other hand , clouds",
    "n and s have a significantly higher color ratio @xmath183 .",
    "this enhanced color , and the morphological correspondence with the broad molecular line emitting regions , suggests that the infrared emission from clouds n and s is due to shocks in propagating into the clouds .",
    "conversely , the normal infrared color of clouds a , b , and c is consistent with their being due to ambient molecular clouds .",
    "if the infrared emission from clouds n and s is due to dust , then the relatively higher @xmath184 could be due to smaller or warmer dust grains . for dust heated by the average interstellar radiation field in the solar neighborhood , about half of the emission at 60 @xmath133 m",
    "is thought to be due to small , transiently heated grains ( draine & anderson 1985 ; dsert , boulanger , & puget 1990 ) .",
    "thus , if the enhanced 60 @xmath133 m emission is due to dust grains , then clouds n and s may contain a larger fraction of small grains . an enhanced abundance of small grains would be expected if a significant fraction of larger grains were shattered behind the shock front .",
    "observations of local cirrus clouds with significant velocities revealed that @xmath185 is typical for clouds with @xmath186 km  s@xmath92 , suggesting that grain shattering was significant in the shocks that accelerated local clouds to intermediate velocities ( heiles , reach , & koo 1988 ) .",
    "theoretically , significant shattering is not predicted for slow shocks such as inferred from the widths of the co lines , but faster shocks through somewhat lower - density interclump gas , with @xmath187 km  s@xmath92 , could produce the enhanced 60 @xmath133 m emission ( jones , tielens , & hollenbach 1996 ) .",

    "<S> we have carried out @xmath0co j=21 line observations of the supernova remnant ( snr ) hb  21 in order to search for evidence of interaction with molecular clouds . </S>",
    "<S> we mapped the eastern half ( @xmath1 ) of the snr almost completely . </S>",
    "<S> molecular gas appears to be distributed mainly along the boundary of the snr , but the overall distribution has little correlation either with the distortion of the snr boundary or with the distribution of radio brightness . along the eastern boundary , where the snr was considered to be interacting with molecular clouds in previous studies , </S>",
    "<S> we have not found any strong evidence for the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> instead we detected broad ( 2040  ) co emission lines in the northern and southern parts of the snr . </S>",
    "<S> in the northern area , the broad - line emitting cloud is composed of a small ( @xmath2 or 0.5  pc ) , very bright , u - shaped part and several clumps scattered around it . there is a significant enhancement of radio emission with flat ( @xmath3 ) spectral index possibly associated with this cloud . in the southern area , </S>",
    "<S> the broad - line emitting cloud is filamentary and appears to form an elongated loop of @xmath4 in extent . </S>",
    "<S> small ( @xmath5 or 0.3  pc ) , bright clumps are seen along the filamentary structure . we have obtained sensitive j=10 and j=21 spectra of @xmath0co and @xmath6co molecules toward several peak positions . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of @xmath0co j=21 emission is low ( @xmath7  k ) and the ratio of @xmath0co j=21 to j=10 integrated intensities is high ( 1.62.3 ) , which suggests that the emission is from warm , dense , and clumpy gas . </S>",
    "<S> we have applied an lvg analysis to derive their physical parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the detected broad co lines are believed to be emitted from the fast - moving molecular gas swept - up by the snr shock . the small ( @xmath8  ) shock velocity suggests that the shock is a non - dissociating c - shock . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the correlation of the shocked molecular gas with the previously detected , shocked atomic gas and the associated infrared emission .    </S>"
