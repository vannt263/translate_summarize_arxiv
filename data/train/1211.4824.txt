    "a minor of a graph is obtained by deleting and contracting a finite number of edges of that graph .",
    "the wagner conjecture states that a family of mutually non - minor graphs is necessarily finite  @xcite .",
    "in particular , every minor - closed property of graphs is characterised by a finite number of forbidden minors .",
    "thinking of graphs as spines of surfaces embedded in @xmath0 , we are naturally led to define a minor of a seifert surface as an incompressible subsurface ( i.e. a subsurface whose complement has no disc component ) . here",
    "a seifert surface is a compact orientable surface with boundary smoothly embedded in @xmath0 , considered up to isotopy .",
    "we observe right away that infinite families of mutually non - minor seifert surfaces exist , e.g. families of embedded annuli with pairwise non - isotopic core curves .",
    "in this paper we study a natural minor - closed property derived from the seifert form .",
    "we say that the seifert form of a seifert surface is positive , if its symmetrisation ( @xmath1 in matrix notation ) is positive - definite . in the case of fibred links",
    ", there is a canonical seifert form associated with the fibre surface .",
    "this applies to positive braid links .",
    "let @xmath2 be a positive braid link with non - positive seifert form .",
    "then the fibre surface of @xmath3 contains an incompressible subsurface of type @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath7 .    here the surfaces of type @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the canonical fibre surfaces associated with the positive braids @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the meaning of these will shortly become clear .",
    "the above criterion has a remarkable consequence .",
    "there is a natural one - to - one correspondence between prime positive braid links with positive seifert form and simply laced dynkin diagrams , reading as follows :    @xmath12 @xmath13    @xmath14 @xmath15    @xmath16 @xmath17    @xmath18 @xmath19    @xmath20 @xmath21    naturality means that the quadratic form associated with the dynkin diagrams is isomorphic to the symmetrised seifert form of the corresponding braids .",
    "the knots arising from the series @xmath12 and @xmath16 , @xmath20 are the torus knots of type @xmath22 ( @xmath23 odd ) , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the other diagrams give rise to links with two or three components .",
    "positive braid links are known to have positive signature invariant  @xcite .",
    "positivity of the seifert form is a much stronger feature . for positive braid knots it amounts to the equality @xmath26 between the signature invariant and the minimal genus of the knot .",
    "there is an analogous equality @xmath27 between rasmussen s invariant and the minimal genus , which holds for all positive braid knots  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that positive braid knots with non - positive seifert form are non - alternating ( since alternating knots satisfy @xmath28 ) .",
    "we are left with @xmath22 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 as potential prime alternating positive braid knots .",
    "the latter two are non - alternating .",
    "the torus knots of type @xmath22 are the only prime alternating positive braid knots .    according to cromwell  @xcite ,",
    "the prime components of a positive braid link are positive braid links . therefore alternating positive braid knots are connected sums of torus knots of type @xmath22 .",
    "this statement was previously proved by nakamura within the framework of homogeneous links  @xcite .",
    "a positive braid link is the closure of a positive braid , i.e. a finite product of the standard braid group generators @xmath29 .",
    "it is well - known that positive braid links are fibred ; their fibre surface is the standard seifert surface associated with the braid diagram  @xcite .",
    "we use brick diagrams as a suggestive notation for positive braids and their fibre surfaces .",
    "brick diagrams for the braids appearing in theorems  1 and  2 are depicted in figure  1 .",
    "the small rectangles of a brick diagram ( with the positive orientation ) can be thought of as a basis for the first homology group of the fibre surface , since the latter retracts on the brick diagram .",
    "it is easy to read off the seifert form from a brick diagram . in the above",
    "examples the rectangles are linked in a tree - like pattern ( see figure  2 ) . here",
    "two rectangles are linked if and only if they are arranged as in the braids @xmath30 , @xmath31 or @xmath32 . indeed ,",
    "these all represent the positive trefoil knot .",
    "the rectangles of the braid @xmath33 are not linked since this represents a connected sum of two positive hopf links .",
    "the resulting symmetrised seifert matrices are nothing but the cartan matrices of the linking trees , viewed as coxeter systems .",
    "the first five are positive definite since they correspond to spherical coxeter systems .",
    "the remaining four matrices are @xmath34 @xmath35 and have determinant zero . as a consequence , every seifert surface that contains one of the surfaces @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 as a minor has non - positive seifert form .",
    "we will prove the converse in the next section .",
    "the proofs of theorems  1 and  2 rely on careful considerations on @xmath36- and @xmath37-stranded positive braids .",
    "let @xmath3 be a link represented by a positive @xmath36-braid @xmath38 . applying the braid relation @xmath39 and conjugation to @xmath38",
    "does not affect the link type of its closure .",
    "therefore we may assume @xmath40 with all @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "we use @xmath43 as a shortcut for @xmath38 . in this notation",
    "the braids of the forbidden minors @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath7 read @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( see again figure  1 ) .",
    "the surface @xmath6 can not be defined by a @xmath36-braid .",
    "nevertheless , it is a minor of the fibre surface of the @xmath36-braid @xmath47 , as shown in figure  3 .",
    "note that the brick diagram in the middle represents a seifert surface in a straightforward way , but not a braid . here and thereafter",
    "equality between brick diagrams means isotopy of surfaces or , equivalently , of their boundary links .",
    "the latter is easy to verify .",
    "if @xmath53 and all @xmath56 then either @xmath38 is one of @xmath57 , @xmath58 or @xmath38 contains one of @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "the first two braids are easily identified as @xmath18 and @xmath20 . the others contain the forbidden minors @xmath46 and @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath7 and @xmath4 .      if @xmath61 and one @xmath54 then either @xmath38 contains the forbidden minor @xmath46 or @xmath62 , which represents the same link as @xmath63 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  4 , for @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath61 and both @xmath56 then either @xmath38 contains one of the forbidden minors @xmath45 , @xmath44 or @xmath38 is one of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "these are the braids of type @xmath14 , @xmath16 , @xmath18 and @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a link represented by a positive @xmath37-braid @xmath38 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath38 is irreducible and minimal , i.e. @xmath38 does not decompose into a connected sum of two non - trivial positive braids and @xmath38 has the least braid index among all positive braids representing @xmath3 .",
    "contrary to above , we suppose that @xmath38 has no subwords of the form @xmath72 and @xmath73 . from this and irreducibility",
    "we deduce that @xmath38 contains the fibre surface of the braid @xmath74 as a minor .",
    "in addition , @xmath38 contains at least two non - consecutive generators @xmath75 . keeping in mind that there is no subword of the form @xmath73",
    ", we are left with one of the four minors shown in figure  5 .",
    "the first three contain @xmath6 as a minor ( for the third one , this is best seen after the deformation shown in the figure ) . the last one can be reduced to a @xmath36-braid and does not contain @xmath6 as a minor . in that case @xmath38 must have at least one more crossing of type @xmath78 or @xmath75 in order to be a minimal braid .",
    "a careful consideration brings up two more minors containing @xmath6 , see figure  6 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a link represented by a positive , irreducible and minimal @xmath79-braid @xmath38 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "as in the case of @xmath37-braids , we may suppose that @xmath38 contains a minor of the form @xmath74 , as well as a symmetric version thereof on the right , @xmath81 .",
    "since @xmath38 is irreducible , there exists a chain of small rectangles , successively linked , connecting a rectangle in the second column to a rectangle in the second to last column , as illustrated in figure  7 .",
    "the resulting surface manifestly contains @xmath6 as a minor .    in summary ,",
    "prime positive braid links of minimal braid index @xmath82 have non - positive seifert form .",
    "non - positivity of the seifert form is detected by four forbidden minors @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 . at last , every prime positive braid link with positive seifert form corresponds to a simply laced dynkin diagram .",
    "it is conceivable that theorem  1 carries over to larger classes of fibre surfaces , as long as they share certain features with positive braid surfaces .",
    "more explicitely , we may ask whether theorem  1 holds for all fibre surfaces supporting the tight contact structure on @xmath83 ."
