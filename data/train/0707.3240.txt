    "de sitter ( ds ) spacetime is the maximally symmetric solution of einsten s equation with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "recent astronomical observations of supernovae and cosmic microwave background @xcite indicate that the universe is accelerating and can be well approximated by a world with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "if the universe would accelerate indefinitely , the standard cosmology leads to an asymptotic ds universe .",
    "de sitter spacetime plays an important role in the inflationary scenario , where an exponentially expanding approximately ds spacetime is employed to solve a number of problems in standard cosmology @xcite . in this regard in recent years , many string theorists have devoted to understand and shed light on the cosmological constant or dark energy within the string framework .",
    "the famous kachru - kallosh - linde - trivedi ( kklt ) model @xcite is a typical example , which tries to construct metastable de sitter vacua in the light of type iib string theory .",
    "the quantum field theory on ds spacetime is also of considerable interest .",
    "in particular , the inhomogeneities generated by fluctuations of a quantum field during inflation provide an attractive mechanism for the structure formation in the universe .",
    "another motivation for investigations of ds based quantum theories is related to the recently proposed holographic duality between quantum gravity on ds spacetime and a quantum field theory living on boundary identified with the timelike infinity of ds spacetime @xcite .    in quantum field theory on curved backgrounds among the important quantities describing the local properties of a quantum field and quantum",
    "back - reaction effects are the expectation values of the field square and the energy - momentum tensor for a given quantum state .",
    "in particular , the vacuum expectation values of these quantities are of special interest . for a scalar field on background of ds spacetime the renormalized vacuum expectation values of the field square and the energy - momentum tensor",
    "are investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite by using various regularization schemes .",
    "the corresponding effects upon phase transitions in an expanding universe are discussed in @xcite .",
    "recently it was argued that there is no reason to believe that the version of ds spacetime which may emerge from string theory , will necessarily be the most familiar version with symmetry group @xmath0 and there are many different topological spaces which can accept the ds metric locally ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there are many reasons to expect that in string theory the most natural topology for the universe is that of a flat compact three - manifold @xcite . from an inflationary point of view universes with compact spatial dimensions , under certain conditions , should be considered a rule rather than an exception @xcite ( for observational bounds on the size of compactified dimensions see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the compactification of spatial dimensions leads to the modification of the spectrum of vacuum fluctuations and , as a result , to casimir - type contributions to the vacuum expectation values of physical observables ( topological casimir effect , see @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the effect of the compactification of one of spatial dimensions in ds spacetime on the properties of quantum vacuum for a scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter ( for quantum effects in braneworld models with ds spaces see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we consider the hadamard function . by using the abel - plana summation formula",
    ", we decompose this function in two parts : the first one is the corresponding function for the uncompactified ds spacetime and the second one is induced by the compactness of the spatial dimension . in section [ sec : vevemt ] we use the hadamard function for the evaluation of the vacuum expectation values of the field square and the energy - momentum tensor . as the parts corresponding to the uncompactified ds spacetime are well - investigated in literature , we are mainly concerned with the topological part . the asymptotic behavior of the latter is investigated in detail in early and late stages of the cosmological evolution .",

    "this geometry is a limiting case of toroidally compactified ds spacetime discussed in @xcite and can be used to describe two types of models . for the first one @xmath12  and",
    "it corresponds to the universe with kaluza - klein type single extra dimension .",
    "as it will be shown the presence of extra dimension generates an additional gravitational source in the cosmological equations which is of barotropic type at late stages of the cosmological evolution . for the second model @xmath13 and the results given below describe how the properties of the universe with ds geometry are changed by one - loop quantum effects induced by the compactness of a single spatial dimension .",

    "we are interested in the effects of non - trivial topology on the vevs of the field square and the energy - momentum tensor .",

    "the numbers near the curves correspond to the value of the parameter @xmath76 .",

    "similarly , for a minimally coupled scalar field the parameter @xmath68 is pure imaginary in the case @xmath80 and the first zero of @xmath81 is at @xmath82 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "compactified spatial dimensions appear in various physical models including kaluza - klein type theories , supergravity , string theory and cosmology . motivated by the fact that ds spacetime plays an important role in all these fields , in this paper we investigate the quantum vacuum effects in ds spacetime induced by non - trivial topology of one of spatial dimensions .",
    "we consider a scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter satisfying the periodic boundary condition along the compactified dimension . among the most important characteristics of the vacuum",
    "are the vevs of the field square and the energy - momentum tensor . though the corresponding operators are local , due to the global nature of the vacuum these vevs carry an important information on the global structure of the background spacetime .    in order to derive formulae for the vevs of the square of the field operator and the energy - momentum tensor",
    ", we first construct the hadamard function .",
    "the application of the abel - plana summation formula enabled us to extract from this function the part corresponding to the hadamard function for the uncompactified de sitter spacetime .",
    "as the topological part is finite in the coincidence limit , by this way the renormalization procedure is reduced to that for the standard ds case .",
    "the latter was already realized in literature . as a result",
    "the vevs of the field square and the energy - momentum tensor are decomposed into ds and topological parts .",
    "due to the maximal symmetry of ds spacetime the first one does not depend on the spacetime point and is given by formula ( [ phi20ren ] ) in the case of the field square and by formula ( [ tik0ren ] ) for the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this is not the case for topological parts which are given by formulae ( phi2d1 ) and ( [ tkl ] ) for the field square and the energy - momentum tensor respectively .",
    "in addition , the corresponding vacuum stresses along uncompactified and compactified dimensions are anisotropic . as a result , though the local geometry is not changed by the compactification , here we deal with the topologically induced anisotropy in the properties of the vacuum . of course , this effect is well - known from the corresponding flat spacetime examples .",
    "the topological terms take a simple form , given by formulae ( [ phi2conf ] ) , ( [ tiiconf ] ) , ( [ tddconf ] ) , for special case of a conformally coupled massless scalar field .",
    "these formulae can also be obtained from the corresponding flat spacetime results by using the conformal relation between the geometries .",
    "the topological parts in the vevs of the field square and the energy - momentum tensor are functions of the ratio @xmath62 . for general values of the curvature coupling parameter",
    "the corresponding formulae are simplified in the asymptotic regions of small and large values of this parameter .",
    "in the first case the leading terms in the vevs are the same as those for a conformally coupled field and the topological parts behave like @xmath83 $ ] for the field square and as @xmath84 $ ] for the energy - momentum tensor . in this limit",
    "the topological part dominates the effective cosmological constant and the back - reaction of one - loop quantum effects is important .",
    "the corresponding energy - momentum tensor violates the energy conditions and can essentially change the cosmological dynamics . for large values of the ratio @xmath62",
    "the behavior of the topological parts is different for real and pure imaginary values of the parameter @xmath68 . in the first case",
    "these parts behave like @xmath85 $ ] , whereas in the second case the decay has an oscillatory nature @xmath86 . in this limit",
    "the vacuum stresses are isotropic and the topological part corresponds to an effective gravitational source with barotropic equation of state .",
    "as it was argued in @xcite , the models of a compact universe with nontrivial topology may play an important role in inflationary cosmology by providing proper initial conditions for inflation . in particular , it was shown that in this class of cosmological models the probability of inflation is not exponentially suppressed .",
    "the quantum creation of the universe having compact spatial topology is discussed in @xcite and in @xcite within the framework of various supergravity theories on non - simply connected backgrounds .",
    "note that on manifolds with non - trivial topologies or non - zero curvature , in the evaluation of the vacuum energy no term - by - term cancellation occurs between the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom ( see , for instance , @xcite for a flat spacetime with non - trivial topology and @xcite for the anti de sitter bulk ) . in view of this",
    "it will be interesting to generalize the results of the present paper to other classes of the compactification , in particular , for the toroidal compactification , including higher spin fields .",
