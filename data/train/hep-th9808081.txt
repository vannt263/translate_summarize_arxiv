    "black holes and related classical solutions are a topic of long - standing interest in string theory @xcite .",
    "their study has shed light on old questions @xcite in black hole physics ( see e.g.  @xcite ) as well as dualities @xcite and other stringy issues @xcite .",
    "indeed , it was an investigation of black holes that first lead to maldacena s conjecture @xcite ( based on earlier work , e.g.  @xcite ) relating string theory in asymptotically anti - de sitter space to a conformal field theory on the boundary at spatial infinity . for evidence supporting this conjecture , see @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to investigate asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) black holes in light of maldacena s conjecture .",
    "previous work @xcite has analyzed the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional btz black holes @xcite in this way , using the fact that the classical black hole solutions are certain quotients of ads@xmath0 to identify associated states in the conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "recall , however , that the nonextremal btz black holes have two asymptotically anti - de sitter regions . as a result ,",
    "the conformal boundary of such spacetimes is not the usual @xmath1 of the universal cover of ads@xmath0 , but two copies of this cylinder .",
    "this means that , strictly speaking , such black holes are not described by quite the same conformal field theory as ads@xmath0 and the corresponding states do not lie in the same hilbert space .",
    "we note that the @xmath2 black hole also has only a single asymptotic region and so again can not lie in the same hilbert space as the btz black holes .",
    "in contrast , there are other asymptotically ads black holes which have only a single asymptotic region .",
    "some examples were constructed in @xcite as quotients of ads@xmath0 . for such black holes ,",
    "we expect the state in the boundary cft to be approximately described by the result of a quotient - like operation on the original vacuum @xmath3 of the conformal field theory .",
    "we do not consider here any effects which may result from additional winding modes in the quotient spacetime .",
    "now , the boundary state corresponding to the btz black hole has been characterized as thermal @xcite .",
    "this is a result of the boundary cft having two disconnected components and the fact that such black holes correspond to states of the boundary cft in which the two boundary components are entangled .",
    "thus , the boundary states are not pure states on either boundary component separately . on the other hand , as discussed in @xcite , there is no reason to expect single - exterior black holes to be mixed states in any corresponding sense .",
    "in particular , as the boundary theory is now exactly the same as that of either ads@xmath0 or the @xmath2 black hole , one expects to be able to interpret single - exterior black holes as ( pure state ) excitations of these ground states .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the boundary states for certain single - exterior , asymptotically ads@xmath0 black holes by using a simplified model of the boundary conformal field theory .",
    "our main focus is on a class of spacetimes referred to as @xmath4 geons , which are analogous to the asymptotically flat @xmath5 geon @xcite . in section [ classic ]",
    "we discuss the structure and construction of the @xmath4 geons as quotient spaces of ads@xmath0 . in section [ quantum ]",
    "we first motivate and define our model cft and then verify that the @xmath4 geon corresponds to a pure state of our model theory .",
    "we also verify that the expectation value of the cft hamiltonian in this state coincides with the mass of the black hole in the limit where the black hole horizon circumference is much greater than the length scale associated with the ads space .",
    "this corresponds to the limit where @xmath6 or @xmath7 is much greater than @xmath8 in terms of the left and right momentum , onebrane , and fivebrane quantum numbers of the associated @xcite six - dimensional black string .",
    "note that taking such a limit is also important to remove quantum corrections to the entropy of such black strings .    after developing our technology in the context of the @xmath4 geons",
    ", we then briefly address the single - exterior black holes of refs .",

    "note that while the geometry of the geon depends on  @xmath94 , the geometry of its conformal boundary does not .",
    "in particular , if the internal space is orientable and @xmath94 reverses the orientation , the above construction yields a space - orientable geon .",

    "all of these spacetimes provide exact classical solutions of string theory .",
    "we now turn to the question of what sort of quantum state in the boundary cft of maldacena s conjecture @xcite is induced by the quotient constructions of section [ classic ] .",
    "we specialize to the internal space @xmath13 and , in order to arrive at an orientable spacetime in which we might discuss orientable string theory , we further assume the metric on the @xmath98 to factorize in such a way that a reflection of an @xmath62 provides an internal involutive isometry @xmath94 as discussed in section  [ subsec : internal - dims ]",
    ". we will not consider the full cft suggested by the conjecture but , instead , we consider a simplified linear field theory which we expect to capture the central features of interest .",
    "we consider a set of free scalar fields on the boundary cylinder @xmath101 of @xmath14 , but with certain refinements .",
    "the point is that , as discussed in section  [ subsec : internal - dims ] , the internal isometry @xmath94 does not affect how the identifications of the full spacetime @xmath102 project to identifications of  @xmath39 .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath94 is expected to affect the full conformal field theory of ref .",
    "@xcite on  @xmath39 .",
    "thus , our model must contain enough additional structure to faithfully represent the action of  @xmath103 .",
    "recall that the @xmath4 geon is a quotient of the btz black hole by the involution @xmath104 .",
    "let us take a moment to consider first how this @xmath105 quotient would be reflected in a boundary cft . for a linear field",
    ", it is natural to think of the field on both the btz hole and geon boundaries as being the _ same _ operator - valued distribution on the boundary of the btz hole , but merely smeared against different classes of test functions .",
    "the detailed correspondence is given by lifting a test function from the geon boundary to the btz black hole boundary and dividing by @xmath106 to ensure canonical normalization of the field .",
    "since the geon fields are embedded in this way in the algebra of btz fields , any state on the btz boundary directly induces a state on the geon boundary . as in @xcite ,",
    "it is sufficient to think of a free scalar field @xmath107 on the geon boundary as being a symmetrization of the corresponding field @xmath108 residing on the boundary of the btz black hole : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the covering map from the btz black hole boundary to the geon boundary .",
    "now , in our construction of the orientable geon from ( btz hole)@xmath111 , the involutive spacetime isometry acts on the btz hole dimensions by @xmath104 and on the internal toroidal dimensions by reflecting one of the @xmath62 s of the  @xmath98 .",
    "thus , we must include in our model some feature that corresponds to this internal topology .",
    "we recall that the topology of the internal torus is captured @xcite by the fact that the boundary cft should be a nonlinear sigma model whose target space is a symmetric product of copies of the  @xmath98",
    ". a  given @xmath62 factor of the internal space is represented as a symmetric product of @xmath62 factors in the target space of the sigma model .",
    "it is clear that , when acting on the boundary field theory , the involution that exchanges a point @xmath112 with its image @xmath113 should act nontrivially on this part of the sigma model , reflecting the appropriate @xmath62 factors in the target space .",
    "this is in direct analogy with the constructions of @xcite , where the involutions acted only on the internal  @xmath97 .",
    "we will model this feature by replacing the part of the sigma model associated with the appropriate @xmath62 factors by a single scalar field  @xmath114 . to tighten the analogy with the sigma model",
    ", one might like to think of the field space of @xmath114 as compactified to a circle of the same size as the internal @xmath62 ( say , length @xmath115 ) .",
    "however , this would present certain problems for our quotient construction .",
    "setting aside the reflection of this @xmath62 for the moment , consider the analogue of ( [ sym ] ) for a field @xmath116 which is periodic in field space with this period .",
    "the resulting geon field @xmath117 would then have period @xmath118 . on the other hand ,",
    "the quotient by @xmath119 does not change the size of the internal @xmath62 factors . note that the @xmath120 normalization factor in ( [ sym ] ) is fixed by the commutation relations and the behavior of the green s functions .    in order to have a faithful representation of the involution @xmath121",
    ", we choose to ignore the compactness of the @xmath62 and to allow our field @xmath114 to take values on a real line . in analogy with the @xmath62 it replaces",
    ", this line will be reflected through the origin by the action of the involution on our field theory .",
    "for contrast , the rest of the sigma model will be replaced by a single free scalar field @xmath122 whose field space is not affected by the involution .",
    "our simple model allows exact calculations to be done and captures many features of interest .",
    "a notable exception , however , is that the central charge of our model is  @xmath123 , while that of the cft in maldacena s conjecture is @xmath124 .",
    "this we will correct by hand when considering the energies of our states in section  [ energies ] .    in finding the geon state in the cft we will proceed as indicated above , first calculating the boundary state of the btz hole in section  [ qbtz ] , and then performing a final identification to yield the state for the geon in section  [ geon ] .",
    "though the state on the black hole boundary has been considered in @xcite , setting up the btz calculation in a different way will make our geon calculation particularly straightforward .",
    "in addition , we will be able to see certain effects of the compact boundary that were neglected in @xcite .",
    "sections [ qbtz ] and [ geon ] consider only the oscillator modes of our scalar fields .",
    "the zero modes are more subtle and are treated separately in section  [ zero ] .",
    "section [ energies ] discusses the energy of our states and compares the result with the mass of the corresponding black hole or geon .",
    "[ osc ]    as discussed in section  [ classic ] , the btz black hole is the quotient of the region @xmath125 under the discrete isometry group generated by  @xmath126 .",
    "similarly , the boundary of the btz hole may be thought of as the quotient of the region @xmath127 in the boundary @xmath39 of @xmath14 under the group generated by  @xmath128 .",
    "we would now like to consider the vacuum state @xmath129 that is defined on @xmath39 with respect to the timelike killing vector  @xmath29 , and construct the state that @xmath129 induces on the black hole boundary . since the quotient of @xmath47 to the btz black hole does not act on the internal factors ,",
    "the construction is identical for both @xmath122 and @xmath114 and the discussion below applies to either field .",
    "recall that the null coordinates @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( [ alphabeta - r ] ) define a conformal mapping of @xmath54 onto minkowski space ( and similarly for  @xmath55 ) . in terms of this minkowski space ,",
    "the map @xmath128 is just a spatial translation , and when the overall scale of the metric is chosen as in  ( [ dr - metric1-conf ] ) , the proper distance of the translation is  @xmath130 .",
    "thus , these identifications enact the usual compactification of minkowski space to @xmath1 .",
    "the effect of the compactification on the scalar field theory is merely to remove all modes that are not appropriately periodic and to reinterpret the periodic modes , which are not normalizable on @xmath54 ( or  @xmath55 ) , as normalizable modes on the cylinder .",
    "the nontrivial part in this construction is that , as noted in section  [ subsec : btz ] , the timelike killing vectors on the two boundary components of the btz black hole do not lift to the timelike killing vector @xmath29 on  @xmath39 : the future timelike killing vector on the boundary component arising from @xmath54 lifts to @xmath131\\eta$ ] , and that on the boundary component arising from @xmath55 lifts to @xmath132\\eta$ ] .",
    "thus , in order to interpret the state induced by @xmath129 on the btz hole boundary in terms of the btz particle modes , we must first write the state induced by @xmath129 on @xmath133 in terms of continuum - normalized particle states that are positive frequency with respect to @xmath46 on @xmath54 and with respect to @xmath134 on  @xmath55 . this calculation is quite similar to expressing the minkowski vacuum in terms of rindler particle modes ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    to begin , consider the mode functions    [ rindler - modes ] @xmath135}^{i\\epsilon\\omega } \\ \\ , \\\\ & & u^{l}_{\\omega , \\epsilon } : =   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi\\omega } }   { \\left [ \\tan\\biglb((-\\theta + \\epsilon t)/2 \\bigrb ) \\right]}^{-i\\epsilon\\omega } \\ \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath136 , the index @xmath137 takes the values  @xmath138 , and the modes with superscript @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) have support in @xmath54  ( @xmath55 ) .",

    "the geon state for @xmath114 is normalizable but the corresponding state for @xmath122 is not .",
    "we note that the @xmath114 zero mode state can in fact be calculated without dealing with distributions at all .",

    "thus , we consider the notion of energy defined by this vector field .",
    "the thermal behavior noted in section [ osc ] is therefore associated with a temperature @xmath318 .",
    "because the total energy is a sum of the hamiltonians for the left- and right - moving modes separately , it is apparent from an examination of ( [ vacbtzhole - expanded ] ) and ( [ vacbtzhole - proj ] ) that the expected energy of the oscillator modes is _ exactly _ the same for the btz and geon states .",
    "the extra minus signs in ( [ vacbtzhole - proj ] ) do not affect the expectation value and the hamiltonian of , say , the right - moving modes on our boundary component does not care whether a right - moving state there is correlated with a mode on another boundary component or with a left - moving mode on the same boundary component . in both cases ,",
    "the result is just the expected energy in a thermal state of temperature @xmath319 .",
    "the same is also true of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "for a zero mode on a component of the btz boundary , one sees from the regulated expression ( [ bom ] ) that the state again acts like a thermal state at the same temperature .",
    "while such a state is not normalizable in the @xmath263 limit , the expectation value of the energy associated with @xmath29 is finite and equal to @xmath320 . on the geon boundary ,",

    "the singularities , and the exotic topology , are hidden behind the horizon .",
    "it follows from the above that the conformal boundary of the swedish geon consists of just one copy of the conformal boundary of @xmath14 . as explained in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , this boundary emerges from the boundary @xmath39 of the original @xmath14 as the quotient of a set @xmath348 under the discrete group @xmath349 generated by @xmath350 and @xmath351 .",

    "a  similar description is possible for the swedish geon boundary @xcite . among the countably many diamonds constituting  @xmath352 ,",
    "let @xmath354 be the one that intersects @xmath48 in the interval @xmath355",

    "we would now like to use unruh s analytic continuation method @xcite to find the oscillator mode state @xmath375 that is induced on the boundary of the geon by the usual oscillator mode vacuum @xmath150 on  @xmath39 .",
    "this means that we must form from the @xmath376-modes ( [ sgeon - modes ] ) and their complex conjugates linear combinations , the @xmath151-modes , that satisfy two requirements .",
    "first , when analytically continued to the lower half of the complex planes in @xmath149 and  @xmath377 , the @xmath151-modes must be bounded analytic functions : this guarantees that they are purely positive frequency linear combinations of the modes that define  @xmath150 .",
    "note that the @xmath151-modes may have singularities at certain real values of @xmath149 and  @xmath377 , but apart from these singularities , the analytic continuation defines them as functions on all of @xmath39 and not just in the diamond @xmath378 .",
    "second , the @xmath151-modes must accommodate the fact that the geon boundary field operator on @xmath352 is constructed by averaging @xmath122 over @xmath349 , as in  ( [ geonfields - phi ] ) .",
    "this means that the @xmath151-modes must be invariant over  @xmath349 , while each of the @xmath376-modes ( [ sgeon - modes ] ) , when analytically continued from @xmath354 to  @xmath352 , is individually invariant only under the subgroup of @xmath349 generated by  @xmath360 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath349 takes @xmath149-independent functions into @xmath149-independent functions and similarly @xmath377-independent functions into @xmath377-independent functions .",
    "the @xmath151-modes can therefore be divided into right - movers , constructed from @xmath379 and their complex conjugates , and left - movers , constructed from @xmath380 and their complex conjugates . for concreteness , consider the right - movers . to put the problem into a mathematically familiar form , we replace @xmath149 by the coordinate @xmath381 . in terms of  @xmath382",

    "@xcite . ] expressing the modes @xmath379 ( [ sgeon - modes - u ] ) in terms of  @xmath382 , we see that finding the boboliubov transformation reduces to finding the coefficients @xmath394 in the expansions @xmath395 ^{2\\pi n i/\\gamma } \\ \\ , \\label{sge - wexp}\\ ] ] where the terms with positive @xmath174 come from the @xmath396 and the terms with negative @xmath174 come from the complex conjugates .",
    "note that , by construction , each term on the right - hand - side of ( [ sge - wexp ] ) is invariant under the fractional linear transformation @xmath397 , whose fixed points are at @xmath398",
    ".    we shall not pursue the analysis further here , but we make one speculative comment . on the real axis , both @xmath388 and @xmath389 map the interval @xmath383 completely outside this interval .",
    "if @xmath383 , both @xmath388 and @xmath389 thus take each term in the sum ( [ sge - wexp ] ) to a term whose magnitude differs by the factor @xmath399 .",
    "this suggests ( but certainly does not prove ) that if the sum is to be invariant , the coefficients @xmath394 should be exponentially increasing in  @xmath400 . if this is true , comparison with the relative weights of the terms in ( [ w - modes ] ) suggests ( but again certainly does not prove ) that @xmath375 might appear in some respects as a thermal state in a temperature proportional to  @xmath401 .",
    "we leave the examination of these speculations subject to future work .",
    "we have seen that , in our model , an @xmath4 geon corresponds to a pure state of finite energy on the cads@xmath0 boundary . in particular , these states contain correlations between the right- and left - moving sectors such that , when one of these sectors is traced over , the other sector is left in a thermal state .",
    "the expectation value of the hamiltonian in an @xmath4 geon state is exactly the same as the expectation value of the hamiltonian ( for either of the boundary components ) in the corresponding btz black hole state , and this value agrees with the the classical mass of the spacetimes in the limit where the black hole is much larger than the length scale of the ads space .",
    "in our model , the zero mode parts of our states @xmath402 and @xmath403 were not normalizable .",
    "this was due to the noncompact range of our fields and the resulting continuous spectrum of the zero mode hamiltonian .",
    "for the same reason , the ground state @xmath404 of our model theory is again non - normalizable .",
    "since our final states were in fact induced from the ground state , it is no surprise that our construction failed to generate normalizable states .",
    "indeed , the surprise is that the field @xmath114 is in a normalizable state on the geon boundary . in all cases ,",
    "we arrive at a generalized state that may be expressed in the usual way in terms of distributions .",
    "while we were not able to complete a corresponding analysis of the swedish geon states , the fact that these black holes have only a single asymptotic region ( with topology @xmath1 ) leads one to once again expect pure states .",
    "still , calculating one of these states would be of interest as it is far from clear what sort of correlations it would contain . in particular , in contrast with an @xmath4 geon , the identifications that lead to a swedish geon act separately on the right- and left - moving parts of the cft .",
    "thus , there should be no correlations between right- and left - moving modes and the correlations must take a rather different form than for an @xmath4 geon . nonetheless , the hypothesis that a swedish geon is ` not too far ' from a thermal state is supported by the behavior of the ( as yet formal ) unruh modes of section [ swedish ] under analytic continuation . another motivation for studying",
    "the swedish geon is that , since the identifications that yield an orientable swedish geon need not act on the internal factors , such geons may more readily allow a treatment of fields with compact target spaces .",
    "one might also try to generalize our calculation to higher - dimensional single - exterior locally ads black holes constructed from the two - exterior locally ads black holes of refs .",
    "@xcite via a suitable involution .",
    "however , such single - exterior black holes are of somewhat less interest as their asymptotic topology is always different from the asymptotic topology of ads space .",
    "thus , the black hole and the ads space will in any case not correspond to quite the same boundary field theory .",
    "of course , the real interest is to extrapolate our results to the more complicated cft which forms the basis of maldacena s duality conjecture @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty with our model was that we were unable to capture the compact nature of the moduli space of this theory .",
    "it is unclear to us to what extent quotients of the type described here can actually be carried out in a nonlinear field theory .    it is natural to assume , however , that the major qualitative difference between our model and the full theory is that the btz and geon states become normalizable , placing the fields @xmath117 and @xmath200 in their ground states",
    "certainly , we would once again expect an @xmath4 geon to be associated with a pure state ( of finite energy ) in the usual hilbert space .",
    "it should contain correlations of the sort found here , between identical right- and left - moving modes , again defining a thermal state with respect to either the right- or left - moving sector alone .",
    "although we have not discussed fermions in our model , if they were included with antiperiodic boundary conditions the associated geon state would be interpreted as an excited state of the cft vacuum representing ads space .",
    "on the other hand , fermions may also be included with periodic boundary conditions , in which case the ground state of the cft is associated @xcite with the @xmath2 btz black hole and our geon is a corresponding excited state .",
    "these two cases would correspond to string theories twisted in different ways around the nontrivial topology of the black hole throat .    as excited states , the @xmath4 geon states",
    "are certainly not invariant under time translations .",
    "in fact , an inspection of ( [ vacbtzhole - proj ] ) shows that they are not even stationary .",
    "this is in accordance with the fact that the timelike killing field in the exterior region of the geon spacetime can not be extended to a globally - defined killing field on all of the spacetime .",
    "now , in the theory considered here , all of the modes ( except the zero modes ) of our scalar fields are periodic in time with a common period .",
    "thus , the oscillator part of our geon state is actually periodic in time .",
    "this is not a feature of the classical geon spacetime and it is _ not _ a feature that one would expect to survive in the full boundary cft .",
    "indeed , already in describing the original ads space we see that this periodicity must be broken ( by the anomalous dimensions of certain operators in the cft @xcite ) if the boundary theory is to describe aperiodic processes .    in order to see what should be expected when this periodicity is broken",
    ", we note that the construction of the geon boundary state is in direct parallel with the construction given in @xcite of vacua on the entire asymptotically flat @xmath5 geon spacetime and on an analogous rindler - type spacetime .",
    "in those cases , it was found that the correlations between field modes became unobservable by localized detectors far from the preferred time @xmath48 and that the state behaved for many purposes as a thermal ( _ i.e. _ , mixed ) state .",
    "clearly , we expect parallel results here .",
    "it is true that , since any correspondence between the boundary cft and the bulk string theory will be nonlocal , the relevance of local detectors on the boundary is unclear .",
    "however , one still expects that the geon state will , in an appropriate sense , approximate the btz state over a single boundary component at early and late times .",
    "perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of our calculation is the way in which the reflection of an internal @xmath62 is represented in the boundary quantum state .",
    "our results are similar to those of @xcite , in that the identifications on the internal dimensions are reflected in certain symmetries of the cft quantum states . in our model , this involved the state of the scalar field  @xmath114 , which was associated with the @xmath62 factor on which our spacetime identifications act . by including more of the full nonlinear sigma model and thus capturing more of the internal dimensions",
    ", we could arrive at similar states that correspond to other orientable @xmath4-like geons with different internal spaces , including orbifolds .",
    "in contrast , the complicated topology of the swedish geons is associated only with the ads factor of the spacetime ( and not with the internal compact dimensions ) .",
    "it would therefore be interesting to probe this issue further through a full calculation of a swedish geon boundary state .",
    "finally , we note that if @xmath200 were the physical field on the geon , the oscillator state would differ only by removing the factors of @xmath405 . placing the zero mode in its ground state , one constructs in this way a state that one is tempted to associate with string theory on a non - orientable @xmath4 geon .",
    "thus , one might speculate that it may be possible to describe states of non - orientable string theory in terms of the same cft hilbert space .",
    "whether or not this happens in the full theory or is merely an artifact of our model must , of course , be left for future studies .",
