    "in recent experiments of eta photoproduction on the deuteron at graal@xcite and at cb - taps - elsa@xcite an enhanced cross section has been observed in the neutron channel around @xmath2  mev , which is not visible in eta photoproduction on the proton target . in 1997 ,",
    "diakonov , petrov and polyakov had predicted an exotic anti - decuplet of baryons within the chiral soliton model@xcite . besides the famous @xmath6",
    ", they also predicted a non - strange member @xmath7 , which could have been identified with the @xmath8 state listed in the particle data tables@xcite .",
    "furthermore , this state was predicted with a much stronger coupling to the @xmath9 than to the @xmath10 channel .",
    "after the first pentaquark signals had been reported@xcite , in a new partial wave analysis arndt et al.@xcite reported about two possible non - strange candidates with masses 1680  mev and 1730  mev and widths smaller than 30  mev . before ,",
    "polyakov and rathke@xcite had shown that within their model , the non - strange member of the antidecuplett around 1700  mev should couple much stronger electromagnetically to the neutron than to the proton . in this respect",
    "the new observations received some attractions and explanations with pentaquark states have been searched .",
    "however , very different to the @xmath4 signals that were reported as extremely narrow peaks of the order of and even below 1  mev , the bump in eta photoproduction is quite broad and looks more like a typical nucleon resonance structure with a width of the order of 100  mev .",
    "surprisingly , the isobar model etamaid2001@xcite which was only fitted to proton data available in 2001 , describes this bump structure very well .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath11 resonance came out of this fit with an unusually large @xmath9 branching ratio , strongly violating @xmath12 symmetry bounds@xcite .",
    "already from pion photoproduction and also from the simple quark model , the @xmath13 resonance is well known as a resonance that couples much stronger to the neutron than to the proton . as an alternative to the strong @xmath13 model , in our more recent isobar analysis ( etamaid2003 )",
    "we have found that a modification of the nonresonant background , however , would modify the eta branching very strongly . in tables",
    "[ ta1 ] and [ ta2 ] it is shown that some higher resonances ( and in particular the @xmath13 ) almost disappear if the standard treatment of @xmath14-channel vector meson exchange with single poles is replaced by regge trajectories . such a reggeization is definitely required at very large energies of a few gev , but at the rather low energies of @xmath15  gev , where the bump occurs , regge trajectories are usually not seriously considered .",
    "the isobar models @xmath0-maid and @xmath1-maid are similar to the unitary isobar model maid . they are constructed with a nonresonant background of nucleon born terms and @xmath14-channel vector meson exchange , plus a number of @xmath16-channel nucleon resonance excitations ,",
    "@xmath17 the nonresonant background contains the usual born terms and vector meson exchange contributions .",
    "it is obtained by evaluating the feynman diagrams derived from an effective lagrangian .",
    "the born terms are evaluated in the standard way with pseudoscalar coupling , and the details can be found in ref .  .",
    "in the reggeized model , however , we do not include the born terms .",
    "the reason is that the correct treatment for the @xmath18-channel nucleon exchange , together with the reggeized @xmath14-channel vector meson exchanges , requires to also introduce the nucleon regge trajectories . because of the lack of high energy data at backward angles , it is currently difficult to determine this @xmath18-channel contribution .",
    "since the coupling constants @xmath19 and @xmath20 are small , the difference caused by the absence of the born terms is negligible at low energies .    for each partial wave @xmath21 the resonance excitation is parameterized with standard breit - wigner functions with energy dependent widths , @xmath22 where a hadronic phase is introduced , @xmath23 , a relative sign between the @xmath24 and the @xmath25 couplings .",
    "for a few states the relative phases are well determined and can be found in the particle data tables , for most of the states it can be used as a free parameter in our partial wave ( pw ) analysis .",
    "the principal fit parameters of our pw analysis are the resonance masses @xmath26 , the total widths @xmath27 , the branching ratios @xmath28 and the photon couplings @xmath29 .",
    "however , we fix those parameters , where reliable results are given by pdg , see tables  [ ta1 ] and  [ ta2 ] .    the total width @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bwres ] ) is the sum of @xmath31 , the single - pion decay width @xmath32 , and the rest , for which we assume dominance of the two - pion decay channels , @xmath33 the details of the parametrization of the energy - dependent widths and the vertex function @xmath34 can be found in refs .  .",
    "in this section , we present the @xmath0 photoproduction results from the reggeized model as well as the standard @xmath0-maid model with vector meson pole contributions . in the reggeized model ,",
    "we replace the @xmath14-channel @xmath36 and @xmath37 exchanges used in @xmath0-maid by the regge trajectories while keeping the same @xmath38 contributions .",
    "both models are fitted to photoproduction data of cross sections from taps@xcite , graal@xcite , and clas@xcite as well as polarized beam asymmetries from graal@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cbeta ] we compare our results with published data ( upper panels ) and with the preliminary results of the cb - taps - elsa experiment ( lower panels ) for both etamaid2003 versions .",
    "the model using standard vector meson poles , similar to the etamaid2001 model , produces a bump in the neutron cross section , whereas the model with vector meson regge trajectories shows similar structures for proton and neutron cross sections and leads therefore to a flat neutron to proton ratio .     total cross sections for eta photoproduction on proton and neutron ( left : maid2003 with standard vector meson poles , right : maid2003 with reggeized vector mesons ) . in the upper row the calculations",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=234 ]    the problem with our model ( i ) is the unusually large @xmath9 branching ratio of 17% for the @xmath13 resonance , which strongly violates @xmath12 , where an upper limit of @xmath39 has been evaluated@xcite .",
    "furthermore , it may also be in conflict with single and double pion photoproduction data on the neutron as well as with the hadronic @xmath40 reactions , that are the more standard sources for branching ratios .",
    "however , all those data are not good enough to draw definite conclusions . on the other side , the reggeized model ( ii ) , which does not require a large @xmath13 coupling in order to explain the cross section and beam asymmetry data can not describe the bump structure in the neutron data .",

    "already diakonov et al.@xcite in a chiral solition model and arndt et al.@xcite in a modified partial wave analysis had reported about a possible @xmath3 state in the region around @xmath41  mev with a width smaller than 30  mev , that should couple quite strongly to the @xmath9 channel .",
    "furthermore , polyakov and rathke@xcite have shown that the e.m .",
    "transition moment of the neutron should be much larger than for the proton , with a ratio of @xmath42 . based on these properties",
    "we have included this state as a @xmath43 resonance in our isobar model with parameters given in table  [ ta3 ] and have calculated the cross sections for both a free proton and a free neutron target .",
    "the total cross sections can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pq ] , where for the neutron this state pops out of the background as a sharp resonance , while it is hidden in the background for the proton target .",
    "the huge difference can be understood from the fact , that the e.m .",
    "moments or couplings enter quadratically in the cross sections , thus giving a ratio of one order of magnitude .",
    "however , such a sharp resonance would not show up in an experiment on a bound neutron in a deuteron target .",
    "due to fermi motion , the sharp resonance state becomes broadened and gets a shape similar to an ordinary nucleon resonance with a width of around 100  mev .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : pq ] shows a calculation in the spectator - nucleon approach@xcite .",
    "further corrections of @xmath44 and @xmath45 final state interaction are expected to be small@xcite .",
    "while both reaction mechanisms give similar results for the total cross section , due to the different orbital momentum of the @xmath13 and @xmath3 resonances , they will show up with different angular distributions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsgpq ] we show our calculations for a neutron at @xmath46  mev for a ) the strong @xmath13 model , b ) the narrow @xmath3 model with a phase @xmath47 and c ) the narrow @xmath3 model with a phase @xmath48 .",
    "for all three cases we compare the calculation for a     differential cross section for eta photoproduction on the neutron at @xmath46  mev . from left to right , the first panel shows the result of @xmath0-maid2003 with standard vector meson poles and a strong @xmath11 resonance , the second panel shows the result with the reggeized model and a narrow @xmath43 resonance with a hadronic phase @xmath47 , the third panel is similar to the second but with a negative hadronic phase .",
    "the dashed lines are for a free neutron target and the solid lines for a quasi - free neutron of a deuteron target .",
    "the cross section on a quasi - free neutron refers to the so - called effective @xmath49 system , where the initial nucleon is assumed to be at rest in the deuteron .",

    "it can only interfere with other contributions in the same partial wave , e.g. from the background , and the difference can hardly be seen .",
    "the experimental data base for @xmath1 photoproduction is still rather limited . besides the total cross section data measured decades ago at desy , the only modern data were obtained at saphir - elsa@xcite and very recently at jlab / clas@xcite .",
    "further data for differential cross sections have been taken at cb - elsa which can be expected to come out soon .",
    "the isobar model @xmath1-maid is conceptional very similar to the @xmath0-maid .",
    "the vector meson couplings used in the @xmath14-channel exchanges are well determined : the photon couplings can be obtained from the electromagnetic decay widths of @xmath52 and @xmath53 and for the strong couplings the same values as in @xmath0 photoproduction are used .",
    "furthermore , we neglect the born terms as in the case of @xmath0 photoproduction .",
    "therefore , the background contributions are completely fixed and only the resonance parameters are varied to fit the data .",

    "the also unknown branching ratios into the @xmath58 channel can not be fitted simultaneously .",
    "therefore , we only determine effective @xmath59 couplings for both helicity states , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the results of our fit to the new clas data are given in table  [ ta4 ] .",
    "from our previous fit to the saphir data we concluded three solutions with a reggeized vector meson background and a ) an @xmath62 resonance , b ) an @xmath63 and a @xmath64 and c ) an @xmath65 and a @xmath66 .",
    "all of them give similar @xmath67 with the old bonn data but fail to describe the new clas data .",

    "the @xmath3 and @xmath69 states around @xmath71  mev can be identified with the listed states @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "this data is also well fitted within the relativistic meson - exchange models of sibirtsev@xcite and nakayama , haberzettl@xcite , including also the hadronic reaction @xmath74 .",
    "besides the sub - threshold resonances @xmath75 , @xmath8 , @xmath76 which contribute to the background , the fit to the data also finds resonant contributions of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , see ref .  .",
    "obviously , with only differential cross section data many solutions with different resonances are possible and no definite conclusions can be drawn at this stage .",
    "in this paper we have presented a new partial wave analysis with recent data on @xmath0 and @xmath1 photoproduction .",
    "the data give rise to interesting speculations about a narrow @xmath3 resonance in @xmath79 and missing resonances in @xmath59 .",
    "however , these solutions are not unique .",
