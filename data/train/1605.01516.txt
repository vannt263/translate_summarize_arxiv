    "cosmic gamma - ray observations can explore high - energy phenomena in space with imaging , timing , energy spectra , and polarization .",
    "it is important to observe the polarization because the polarimetry of cosmic gamma - rays can be distinguished in the emission model of an astronomical object ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , high - energy gamma - ray polarimetry in space has not yet been investigated because of measurement difficulties @xcite .",
    "polarimetry with electron - positron pairs from high - energy gamma - rays was suggested in 1950 @xcite .",
    "the signature of linearly polarized gamma - rays can be detected by measuring the azimuthal angle of the produced electron - positron pairs .",
    "the azimuthal distribution can be presented as @xmath0 = @xmath0@xmath1[1 + @xmath2(2@xmath3 ) ] , where @xmath4 is the linear polarization fraction , @xmath5 is the modulation factor , i.e. , the maximum amplitude when @xmath4 is 100@xmath6 , and @xmath3 is the azimuthal angle between the polarization direction and the detected electron - positron pair . fig .",

    "it is important to measure the azimuthal angle of an electron - positron pair using a thin converter before the tracks have traversed @xmath1010@xmath11 x@xmath1 @xcite , because the azimuthal angle is diffused by multiple coulomb scattering while the particles traverse a detector . however , it is also important to efficiently produce electron - positron pairs using a thick converter .",
    "a pair polarimeter for linearly polarized gamma - rays has already been developed at the ground level @xcite ; however , this is not optimal for cosmic gamma - ray observations in terms of detection efficiency .",
    "several groups are studying the polarimetry for cosmic gamma - rays ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; however , it is difficult to develop a gas or solid - state detector capable of both suppressing multiple coulomb scattering and converting gamma - rays efficiently .",
    "here we choose an other approach to develop an optimum pair polarimeter , keeping the high density of an emulsion , and using a sub - micron resolution .",
    "the graine project is a balloon - borne experiment that observes cosmic gamma - rays using an emulsion - based telescope @xcite .",
    "the telescope comprises a nuclear photographic emulsion , i.e. , a 3d - charged particle tracking detector with sub - micron spatial resolution .",
    "emulsion acts not only as a converter but also a tracker ; therefore , it can detected the beginning of the electron - positron pair and measured its azimuthal angle before multiple coulomb scattering could exert its deleterious effect .",
    "the conversion efficiency of incoming gamma - rays can be enhanced by stacking emulsion films .",
    "therefore , the emulsion - based telescope can be optimum polarimeter for high - energy cosmic gamma - ray observations .    fig .",

    "we aim to observe the polarization of astronomical objects such as pulsars , blazars , grbs and gamma - ray flares .    in this paper , we report the first demonstration of polarization sensitivity of emulsion - based telescope .",
    "polarized gamma - ray beam exposure was performed at the spring-8 facility in japan using leps ( laser electron photon beam line at spring-8 ) @xcite .",
    "the gamma - rays were produced by inverse compton scattering of an argon polarized laser ( with a wavelength of 351 nm , 95@xmath6 linear polarization ) off the electrons ( the energy was 8 gev ) circulating in the storage ring .",
    "the maximum energy of the gamma - ray at the compton edge was 2.4 gev and the polarization fraction had a maximum value of 93@xmath6 and 50@xmath6 at 2.4 gev and 1.5 gev , respectively .",
    "the produced gamma - rays were travelled to the experimental hutch located 69 m from the inverse compton scattering region .",
    "the gamma - ray beam was exposed perpendicular to the emulsion chamber for @xmath101 s. the beam spot size was collimated to a diameter of 2.3 cm .",
    "the layout of the emulsion chamber is shown in fig .",

    "after the emulsion films development , they were scanned by an automatic emulsion scanning system at the nagoya university @xcite in the 3@xmath143 cm@xmath12 region around the beam center , and all the emulsion tracks were reconstructed @xcite . to enhance the polarization fraction of the gamma - ray beam , the connection window ( the angle and position difference ) of emulsion tracks between films was calculated in accordance with multiple coulomb scattering , and the reconstruction threshold was set to 500 mev / c .",
    "we searched for unbiased single - tracks , which started at mid - film and connected to @xmath1625 , as candidates of gamma - ray events .",
    "the search simultaneously required that the candidates be located in a 0.63 cm radius from the beam center .",
    "this corresponded to the selection of @xmath180.8 gev for the primary gamma - rays .",
    "subsequently , 4228 gamma - ray event candidates were selected automatically from film @xmath165 to @xmath1620 .",
    "the conversion points of each selected candidate were checked on a tv monitor ; the microscopic view was projected via a ccd camera . in this check",
    ", we confirmed that the selected candidates did not penetrate to the upper films , and 2551 events were confirmed to have a disappearance and then their azimuthal angles were measured when their distance was split by @xmath180.5 @xmath15 m .",

    "the digitization of the pixel - pitch was 0.13 @xmath15 m in this optical system .",
    "the intrinsic resolution of the azimuthal angle based on the size of the silver crystal @xcite was calculated to be 2.8@xmath13 .",

    "penetrating tracks were contamination by through trakcs is due to the inefficiency of track recognition .",
    "some events did not split to the pair because one side track may be lower momentum and could not be found out .",
    "overlapped events were due to the same electron - positron pair event , but the different conversion point ( 1 up or down film ) was selected between one side and the other side track . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     gamma - ray beam had an energy dependence of polarization fraction naturally and included the secondary gamma - rays which were induced by residual gas of the beam pipe , so event selection was applied using the opening angle and the arrival direction of the electron - positron pair .",
    "the opening angle correlates to the gamma - ray energy , so we applied the opening angle cut ( @xmath195 mrad was required ) to purify the gamma - ray events . to recover the high energy but uneven ( large opening angle ) events",
    ", we applied the cut of the arrival direction of the single track additionally , which selected on the large opening angle ( @xmath205 mrad ) but the arrival direction is close ( @xmath211 mrad ) to the beam center . to estimate these selection efficiency ,",
