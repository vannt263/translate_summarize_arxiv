    "gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are brief , intense flashes of high energy gamma rays originating at cosmological distances and often associated with subsequent radiation emitted at longer wavelengths from x - ray to radio waves on times scales of minutes to days after the initial gamma ray burst . in the standard model a typical long duration grb",
    "is thought to be formed by the explosion of a compact source that generates an expanding relativistic fireball ( rees @xmath4 mszros 1992 ) .",
    "if the central engine remains active for some time several expanding shells with different speeds ( different lorentz factors , @xmath5 ) can be produced .",
    "the collisions between these shells power the @xmath6-ray prompt emission itself ( internal shocks ) , while the interactions of the relativistic flow with the surrounding medium ( external forward shocks ) generate the so - called afterglow emission that dominates at longer wavelengths and is more long - lived than the prompt emission ( mszros 2002 , piran 1999 ) . assuming that the shock - accelerated electrons producing the radiation have a power - law spectral energy distribution , the afterglow synchrotron emission is expected to exhibit a standard form of spectrum , with two characteristic break frequencies : the typical synchrotron frequency @xmath7 and the cooling frequency @xmath8 ( sari , piran @xmath4 narayan 1998 ) . when the forward shock is formed , a reverse shock that propagates backwards into the ejecta is also generated .",
    "the brightness of the reverse shock emission decays very rapidly compared to the decay of the forward component .",
    "it is predicted that at early time the reverse shock can produce extremely bright optical flashes while at late time the optical flux is completely dominated by the forward shock emission ( mszros @xmath4 rees 1997 , sari @xmath4 piran 1999 ) . in reality , the resultant light curve is a complex , time - dependent mixture of these components and unravelling them provides important insight into the physics and energetics of the explosion .",
    "the study of pre-_swift _ bursts allowed the understanding of late time multiband properties of the afterglows confirming many predictions of the fireball model .",
    "well - sampled pre-_swift _ optical light curves were mostly obtained at late times , typically after few hours from the burst event , and exhibited relatively smooth light curves with simple power law decays , showing breaks at late time ( hints of a jet evolution ) and making clear a strong connection with supernova emission and , thus , the death of massive stars ( e.g. woosley @xmath4 bloom 2006 , malesani et al .",
    "2004 , stanek et al . 2003 ) . the advent of the _ swift _ satellite ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) has opened up a new observational window at early times , revealing more complex light curve behaviour than previously known .",
    "it is now accepted that the x - ray temporal decay of grbs observed by _",
    "swift _ is well described by a canonical light curve ( nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) ; combining the @xmath6-ray ( burst alert telescope , bat , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and x - ray ( x - ray telescope , xrt , burrows et al .",
    "2005 ) data the initial x - ray emission ( rapid fall - off for the first hundred seconds ) is consistent with the tail of the @xmath6-ray emission ( tagliaferri et al .",
    "2005 , obrien et al .",
    "2006 ) and can be modelled by two components that have exactly the same functional form ( willingale et al .",
    "these functions are completely empirical and do not do not provide a physical explanation for the x - ray flares seen in many bursts , but the majority of _ swift _ bursts seem to follow this behaviour .",
    "it was clear that rapid response to obtain early - time optical observations with ground based robotic telescopes was required to pin down the open issue of the emission mechanism for the grb itself and its afterglow .",
    "however , the small number of prompt optical observations simultaneous to the grb @xmath6-ray emission do not yet allow a firm conclusion to be drawn about the grb emission models ( yost et al .",
    "the statistics of these events remain small due to the fact that the grbs detected by _ swift _",
    "satellite are fainter and located at higher redshift ( @xmath9 , le @xmath4 dermer 2007 , jakobsson et al .",
    "2006 ) than those detected by previous missions .",
    "large 2-m robotic telescopes , such as the liverpool and faulkes ( north and south ) telescopes , responding within 1 - 3 minutes of the burst offer a unique tool for probing early - time light curves over a wide range of brightnesses , allowing the extension of the analysis of grb properties to unprecedented depth and time coverage .    based on the theoretical predictions of the forward and reverse shock emission theories , optical light curves at early times should show different shapes depending on the relative contribution of the two components ( kobayashi @xmath4 zhang 2003 , zhang , kobayashi @xmath4 mszros 2003 ) ; possible light curve shapes are illustrated in figure  [ figc1 ] .",
    "in particular , if the optical observations start when the reverse shock component still dominates the optical flux , the shape of the optical light curve will appear as case 1 or case 2 in figure  [ figc1 ] . in the first case",
    "the light curve will show a transition from steep to shallow power law decay index . in the second case",
    "it will show a re - brightening , but if observations do not start early enough the first steep segment ( thick dashed line on figure  [ figc1 ] ) of the light curve should be missing and it will be visible only in the rise of the forward component .",
    "the observed peak in case 2 will correspond to the passage of the @xmath7 in the observing band .",
    "if there is energy injection to the forward shock emission then the light curve should appear as case 3 in figure  [ figc1 ] .",
    "this behaviour can be explained by long - lived central engine activity or large dispersion in the distribution of lorentz factors ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) or related to the time when the energy is transferred from the fireball to the ambient medium ( kobayashi @xmath4 zhang 2007 ) .    within this theoretical framework , we present the analysis of a sample of 63 grbs observed with the network of three 2-m telescopes _ robonet-1.0 _",
    "( gomboc at al .",
    "2006 ) , formed by the liverpool telescope ( lt , la palma , canary islands ) , the faulkes telescope north ( ftn , haleakala , hawaii ) and the faulkes telescope south ( fts , siding spring , australia ) .",
    "for those grbs with detected optical counterparst , we discuss their light curve properties , compare optical and x - ray data and analyse the intrinsic rest frame properties of those bursts with known spectroscopic redshift .",
    "an analysis of the bursts for which no afterglow was detected is also presented and discussed within the standard fireball model .    throughout",
    "we use the following conventions : the power law flux is given as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the temporal decay index and @xmath12 is the spectral slope ; we assume a standard cosmology with @xmath13  km  s@xmath14  mpc@xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; all errors and uncertainties are quoted at the @xmath17 confidence level .",
    "all three telescopes enable rapid response ( the typical mean reaction time is @xmath18 minutes after the trigger ) and deep observations ( @xmath19 21 at @xmath20 minutes after the trigger ) to grb alerts , which are crucial in the case of faint or optically dark bursts .",
    "each telescope operates in a fully robotic mode , responding automatically to a grb satellite alert by immediately over - riding the current observing programme , then obtaining , analysing and interpreting optical images of the grb field using the specially designed , sophisticated pipeline ( lt - trap ) ; subsequent robotic followup observations are then optimised and driven by the automatically derived properties of the afterglow ( see guidorzi et al .",
    "up to september 2007 the network robotically reacted to 63 grbs with 24 optical afterglow detections and 39 upper limits ( figure [ figall ] ) .    in this paper ,",
    "the optical photometry of each optical afterglow was performed using starlink / gaia photometry tools .",
    "each field of view was calibrated with the best data available : 1 ) standards stars observed during the night , if the night was photometric ; 2 ) pre - burst calibration fields ( both for sdss or bessell filters ) reported in gcn circulars ; 3 ) differential photometry with catalogued stars in the field of view ( usnob1.0 catalogue ) .",
    "this procedure has been followed for all the sample data .",
    "all the calibrated magnitudes in the sdss - r filter ( for all the bursts observed with the lt telescope ) were then transformed to the @xmath21 band using the filter transformations given by smith et al .",

    "since the x - ray decay index ( @xmath215 ) is different from both the pre - preak ( @xmath216 ) and the post - break ( @xmath217 ) optical decay indices , the cooling break models can not account for the optical break even if the energy injection or generic wind - like ambient medium is considered .",
    "the observed behaviour of the light curves might be due to a transition in the ambient matter distribution ( monfardini et al .",
    "2006 ) : a blast wave initially propagates into a constant medium and then it breaks out into a wind - like medium .",
    "note that x - ray emission does not depend on the ambient matter density ( and its distribution ) as long as the x - ray band is above the cooling frequency , and that the optical emission ( below @xmath8 ) reflects the change in the ambient matter distribution .",
    "* grb  061126 : for this burst no break is visible in the x - ray band , while in the optical the transition is from steeper to shallower decay index .",
    "this behaviour at early times can be explained as the contribution from the reverse shock component . the detailed study by gomboc et al .",
    "( 2008 ) shows its inconsistency with the standard fireball model ( the steeper decay in the x - ray band and the large ratio of x - ray to optical flux ) .",
    "the bursts belonging to this class are those showing a break in both the optical and the x - ray light curves in their decay phases . in general , breaks in the two bands occur at different times , both chromatic and achromatic breaks are considered .",
    "surprisingly , for only one burst do we observe a break in both bands , although grb  060210 might be classified in this case if we take seriously the last optical data points .",
    "* grb  050730 : if a jet break is responsible for the steep x - ray decay , the electron energy index is @xmath218 . given that x - ray band is below the cooling frequency , the observed x - ray spectral index @xmath219 is consistent with the model prediction @xmath220 .",
    "however , the much shallower optical decay ( @xmath221 ) is inconsistent with the jet break model . as pointed out by pandey et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the possibility of a contribution from the host galaxy or an associated sn to the late time optical afterglow can be ruled out considering the high redshift of the burst ( @xmath222 ) . since after a jet",
    "break a forward shock emits photons practically at a constant radius ( the exponential slowing down ; sari , piran @xmath4 halpern 1999 ) , fluctuations in the ambient medium do not seem to affect the decay rate of the emission . even if there is an effect , both light curves should become shallower ( or steeper ) in the same way because both optical and x - ray bands are in the same spectral domain ( @xmath223 ) . energy injection into a forward shock also can not explain the shallow optical decay because of the same reason .",
    "additional emission components , e.g. the two component jet model or late time internal shocks might make the optical decay slower . the early shallow decay phase observed in the optical and x - ray light curves",
    "could be explained by energy injection ( pandey et al .",
    "2006 ) , though the ceasing of the injection should happen around the time of the jet break .      from this analysis of the optical and x - ray light curves",
    "we conclude that in our sample of 24 optical grb afterglows : 15 bursts can be explained in the context of the standard fireball model ( with modifications : energy injection or variation in the ambient matter distribution ) ; while for the remaining 9 bursts :    * class a : grb  060204b , grb  060512 , grb  070208 , grb  070419a * class b : grb  050713a , grb  060927 , grb  061121 * class c : grb  051111 , grb  061126    the observed data are inconsistent with the predictions of the standard model .      in figure  [ figall2 ]",
    "we translate the observed magnitudes of the optical afterglows into the rest - frame luminosity ( left panel ) .",
    "the subscript @xmath224 used in this section refers to the time in the rest frame of the grbs .",
    "we assumed a standard cosmology ( defined in section 1 ) and we include any correction expected from the distance of the event ( @xmath26 ) and its spectral properties ( @xmath12 ) in order to report all the observed quantities in the rest frame of the grb .",
    "we corrected the optical magnitude for galactic extinction using the reddening maps of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and we applied the _",
    "k_-correction to take into account the fact that sources are observed at different redshifts ( @xmath225 ) .",
    "we do not correct for the host galaxy dust absorption . from this analysis we excluded :",
    "1 ) the bursts for which no spectroscopic redshift was available ( grb  041218 , grb  050713a , grb  060108 , grb  060203 and grb  060204b ) ; 2 ) grb  060510b , for which there is a value of the spectroscopic redshift but the optical light curve is sparsely sampled . after this selection our sub - sample totals 16 objects .    even in the rest frame of the burst , starting the observations about 0.5 minutes after the burst event , a difference of about 4 orders of magnitude in luminosity is evident , particularly at early time .",
    "this spread in intrinsic luminosity remains after including all the available early and late time public data , although there is a hint of a convergence at later times .",
    "it should be noted that our analysis does not take into account any beaming effect .",
    "this collimation correction is known to reduce the observed spread in luminosity for bursts ( frail et al .",
    "2001 , panaitescu @xmath4 kumar 2001 ) but requires a correct determination of the jet opening angle for each burst based on an unambiguous identification of a jet break .",
    "identification of such break times is clearly important but , as discussed in section 4.1.1 is non - trivial due to complex light curve properties and requires well - sampled optical and x - ray light curves from the earliest to the latest possible times .    in a previous study of optical afterglow light curves , liang @xmath4 zhang ( 2006 , hereafter lz06 )",
    "suggested that the optical luminosity at t=1 day ( source frame time ) after the burst shows a bimodal distribution , with a separation at @xmath226  erg  s@xmath14 .",
    "the majority of the bursts in their sample ( 44 bursts in total ) fall into the luminous group ( 34 bursts with @xmath227 ) .",
    "kann et al .",
    "2006 and nardini et al .",
    "2006 ( hereafter k06 and n06 respectively ) found a similar result .",
    "lz06 selected t=1 day as the reference time because at this time the light curves of their sample were better sampled .",
    "moreover they selected this late time because they were concerned about the possible contribution of the reverse shock component or additional energy injection at early times .",
    "the result of n06 was obtained in the same way but extrapolating the luminosity at t=0.5 days ( source frame time ) .",
    "as our observations have good coverage starting at earlier time ( between 1 and 20 minutes in the grb rest - frame ) we have estimated the intrinsic optical luminosity at three different times : 10 minutes , 0.5 days and 1 day ( source frame time ) . in the cases presented here",
    "we have confirmed that the reverse shock component does not affect our analysis .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , in only one case ( grb  061126 ) do we detect the possible contribution of the reverse shock at early times .",
    "our early observations at t=10 minutes are more directly related to the explosion energy during the prompt emission phase .    in table 4",
    "we report the mean values for the rest - frame luminosity calculated at different times .",
    "the two classes defined by lz06 ( dim and lum ) are not consistent with a single population , as clear from their figure  2 . our data ( at any times )",
    "are consistent within the uncertainties with a single population rather than with two separate classes . in fig  [ figlum12h ]",
    "we show the observed luminosity distribution of our sample extrapolated at 12 hours.the distribution is well fitted with a single log - normal function with an average of @xmath228 and a @xmath229 of @xmath230 .",
    "figure  [ figall2 ] ( right panel ) shows the luminosity - redshift distribution for the bursts in our sample . in this figure",
    "we over plot the separation line between the two classes and the highest values for the redshift of the members of the two groups in the lz06 sample .",
    "as pointed out by lz06 , a possible reason for the lack of high redshift members in their dim group is a lack of deep and rapid followup observations .",
    "the burst population detected by _",
    "swift _ has a larger mean redshift and fainter brightness distribution that previous missions ( @xmath231 , @xmath232 , le @xmath4 dermer 2007 ) .",
    "this could explain the results of lz06 , whose sample was based on bursts detected up to august 2005 , thus containing only 7 _ swift _ bursts .",
    "the study presented by k06 of a sample of 16 pre-_swift _ bursts similarly probed the bright end of the grb luminosity function and found similar conclusions to lz06 .",
    "k06 found that on average low - redshift afterglows are less luminous than high - redshift ones , suggesting a bimodal luminosity distribution .",
    "strong selection effects due to observational bias against intrinsically faint afterglows at higher redshifts is a likely explanation for this result .",
    "this observational bias is greatly reduced in our sample thanks to the rapid response and use of red filters on our ground based telescopes to _ swift _ triggers (",
    "14/16 objects used for this analysis were detected by _ swift _ ) .",
    "our results show that faint _",
    "swift _ grbs at higher redshift are readily detected with such rapid , deep optical observations in red filters ( figure  [ figall2 ] , right panel ) , a region of parameter space not accessible in the samples of lz06 or k06 .",
    "the population that is not prevalent in the right panel of figure  [ figall2 ] is bright bursts at low redshifts , probably due to the grb luminosity function such that very luminous bursts rare and a large survey volume is therefore required to detect them .",
    "other authors discuss the possibility of two separate luminosity functions for luminous and underluminous grbs ( nardini et al .",
    "2007 , kann et al .",
    "2007 , liang et al .",
    "2007 , chapman et al . 2007 ) but given the many complex instrumental selection effects inherent in grb discovery and followup , significantly larger samples are required to draw robust conclusions .",
    "swift _ trigger thresholds may provide the basis for such samples in the future .",
    "we consider as an optically dark event , or `` dark burst '' to be a one that satisfies the definition of jakobsson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , i.e. that the slope of the spectral energy distribution between the optical and the x - ray band or spectral index @xmath25 , is @xmath2 0.5 .",
    "even optically detected bursts may be classified as `` dark '' , providing that the optical flux is much fainter than expected from scaling the x - ray flux ( e.g. grb060108 ) .",
    "for all the bursts reported in table 2 no optical counterpart was detected by our telescopes .",
    "apart from a few cases in which our observations were performed at late times , the majority of grbs in our sample were observed by our telescopes reacting rapidly and performing deep , early - time optical observations ( @xmath233 at 5 minutes after the trigger , for co - added images ) . a late response or poor sensitivity",
    "are therefore ruled out as explanations for non - detections in most cases . what , therefore , is the explanation for the lack ( or faintness ) of the optical afterglow for these dark bursts ? to understand this we analyse the x - ray light curve of the bursts in our sub - sample observed by the _",
    "swift_-xrt . using the decay inferred from the fit of the light curves the x - ray and optical fluxes",
    "are extrapolated to a common time .",
    "we assume that the optical light curves for those undetected bursts follow a power law decay with a slope equal to the mean temporal decay of the detected afterglows analysed in section 3 ( @xmath234 ) . alternatively ,",
    "in the x - ray band we use the value derived from the fit of the light curve and reported on table 2 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "three characteristic times t@xmath235 , t@xmath236 and t@xmath237 are used here . the time t@xmath237 = 11 hours is chosen for consistency with the dark burst classification of jakobsson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , while fluxes extrapolated to t@xmath236 = 1 hour and t@xmath235 = 10 minutes exploit our early - time data without compromising observing sensitivity .    as can be seen in figure  [ figuljako ] , the majority of the bursts are located close to the dark bursts region ( @xmath238 ) independent of the selected time , ruling out late observation time as an explanation for the apparent darkness of most bursts . for almost all the bursts ,",
    "the evolution of the optical and x - ray flux follows a line almost parallel to the lines of constant @xmath25 ( bottom right panel ) .",
    "this behaviour can be seen , in the optical band , as a consequence of the assumption of an average decay when making the extrapolation .",
    "any change in the temporal decay would clearly modify this behaviour .",
    "however , it seems that bursts that are classified as `` normal '' after 10 minutes ( bottom left panel ) remain in the same class also after 11 hours ( top left panel ) . at the same time those bursts that are optically dark soon after 10 minutes belong to the class of the so - called `` dark bursts '' also after 11 hours .    in only five cases ,",
    "does the classification of the burst depend on the time for the extrapolation of the flux .",
    "for these five bursts we report also the errors ( including the uncertainties on the flux and on the @xmath11 used for the extrapolation ) in the bottom right panel of figure  [ figuljako ] .",
    "three bursts are classified as normal bursts if we extrapolate at t = t@xmath237 but belong to the class of `` dark bursts '' if we extrapolate at t = t@xmath235 ( grb  050124 , grb  060901 and grb  070721b , red circles on figure  [ figuljako ] ) ; in two cases it is the contrary ( grb  050504 and grb  070219 , blue circles ) . in the latter cases it is clear that the optical flux significantly suppressed compared to the x - ray flux .",
    "this may be due to spectral evolution of those bursts , but within the uncertainties we can not rule out the possibility that nothing changes also for these five bursts .    for 10/39 bursts , as reported in table 2 , an optical / infrared counterpart was identified by larger optical or ir telescopes , with counterparts detected primarily at nir wavelengths .",
    "our observations rule out the large population of bright optical counterparts that were predicted , pre-_swift _ , to exist and be observable with suitably rapid followup observations .",
    "explanations for dark bursts in the era of rapid followup remain : extinction caused by dust ( galactic or host ) , high redshift origin , or both . in some cases ( @xmath239 )",
    "the galactic absorption along the light of sight in the observing band ( a@xmath240 ) for our bursts is significant and may explain the undetected optical counterpart ; however , it is interesting to note that no ir detections have been reported for these grbs .",
    "the effect of ly-@xmath11 absorption due to an high - redshift event ( @xmath241 ) is difficult to evaluate but again this effect could be responsible at least for a fraction of our non - detections ( roming et al .",
    "the possibility of a rapid temporal decay seems to be the most unlikely : in fact , assuming that the undetected bursts of table 2 have a temporal behaviour similar to the detected afterglows of table 1 than the temporal optical decay at early times appears to be shallow , not steep .",
    "another possibility could be an excess of x - ray emission at late time ; if late - time central engine activity is responsible for the production of the early x - ray afterglow in some cases , the additional emission will mask the forward shock x - ray emission and the total flux in the x - ray band would be higher than the value expected for the forward shock emission alone .",
    "this might explain some dark bursts and their distribution on the log  @xmath242-log  @xmath243 diagram .",
    "a combination of these mechanisms and others ( i.e. intrinsic optical faintness , low density circumburst medium ) may combine to explain the high number of bursts that remain undetected at optical wavelengths ( @xmath244 in our sample ) .",
    "* we have classified our afterglows sample into four groups based on breaks in the optical and the x - ray afterglow light curves during the decay phase .",
    "we have used the temporal and spectral properties of the x - ray and optical afterglows to investigate the blastwave physics around the break times within the framework of the standard fireball model ( the synchrotron shock model ) .",
    "the majority of the bursts in our sample ( 15 out of 24 ) are consistent with the standard model . however , for a significant fraction of our sample ( 9 bursts : grb  050713a , grb  051111 , grb  060204b , grb  060512 , grb  060927 , grb  061121 , grb  061126 , grb  070208 and grb  070419a ) , the data can not be explained by the standard model , even if modifications to the simple model are made ( i.e. energy injection or variation in the ambient matter ) .",
    "a possible explanation beyond the standard model is that the early x - ray afterglow is not due to forward shock emission but is instead produced by late - time central engine activity ( e.g. ghisellini et al .",
    "* we have derived the light curves of the optical afterglows in the source rest frame for those bursts with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts ( i.e. not merely assuming a fixed redshift z=1 for all bursts ) .",
    "the optical luminosity function measured at @xmath245  mins and the corresponding distributions for light curves extrapolated to @xmath246  hours and 1 day are uni - modal , showing no evidence for the bi - modality suggested by previous authors .",
    "a fit of the distribution at 10 minutes with a single log - normal yields an average and a sigma values of @xmath247(erg s@xmath14)@xmath248 and @xmath249 , respectively .",
    "liang @xmath4 zhang ( 2006 ) reported a bimodal distribution of optical luminosity at t= 1 day .",
    "two recent studies on the afterglows of _ swift_-era grbs ( kann et al .",
    "2007 and nardini et al . 2007 ) also suggested a clustering of optical afterglow luminosities at one day and 12 hours ( already found by kann et al .",
    "2006 , and nardini et al .",
    "2006 ) , showing again a bi - modality in the luminosity distribution .",
    "this discrepancy may be explained by our ability to detect fainter grbs at high redshift ; in future , larger samples covering a wide range of grb luminosities ( possibly facilitated by lower triggering thresholds on _ swift _ ) will provide stronger tests for the existence of separate classes of grbs .",
    "* by comparing x - ray flux densities and optical upper limits , we have shown that the majority of non - detections in our sample should be classified as dark bursts .",
    "the rapid response of our telescopes to real - time localisations from _ swift _ show that there remains a significant number of genuinely dark grb afterglows and rapid optical temporal decay at early time is ruled out as an explanation for failure to detect optical afterglows at later time . of our 39 non - detections ,",
    "ten afterglows were identified by other facilities , primarily at nir wavelengths , demostrating a small population of bursts in high density host environments .",
    "the lack of optical / ir afterglows for the remaining 29 bursts may be due to effects such as high levels of extinction ( galactic or host ) , circumburst absorption , ly-@xmath11 absorption due to high - redshift or low - density environments suppressing production of optical sychrotron ( or a combination of effects ) .",
    "alternatively , we suggest that if late - time central engine activity is responsible for the production of the early x - ray afterglow emission in some cases , the additional emission will mask the simultaneous , but fainter forward shock x - ray emission and result in an observed x - ray flux that is larger than expected from forward shock emission alone .",
