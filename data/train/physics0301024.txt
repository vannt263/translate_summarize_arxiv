    "the quasi - chemical approach leads to free energies that are in reasonable agreement with available experimental estimates . but this agreement should not obscure the severe approximations that have been made in applying the theory to practical calculations . for divalent cations , it is unclear if purely a inner - shell complex would provide adequate accuracy of solvation free energy estimate .",
    "there are potentially two possible avenues for improvement which we indicate below .",
    "first , the outer - sphere hydration contributions can be obtained using classical molecular mechanics approaches instead of the dielectric continuum model used above .",

    "this seems particularly natural here because the inner shell structures are physically definite ( fig .",
    "[ fg : gr ] ) .",
    "the hydration contribution of those 2@xmath32 shell structures could be obtained using a dielectric continuum model .",
    "also it is possible to apply a lower level of quantum chemical approximation to describe the coupling of the 1@xmath33 and 2@xmath32 shells .",
    "then with an improved estimate for the solvation free energy of the tetra - aqua cation , one could obtain a better estimate for the solvation free energy of be@xmath0 .",
    "this approach is the iterated quasi - chemical scheme and a variant has been successfully applied to hard - sphere fluids @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "however , this approach would be daunting for many reasons .",
    "( a ) obtaining statistically representative 2@xmath32-shell complexes in the gas - phase is difficult .",
    "( b ) the rigid - rotor harmonic oscillator approximation is dubious for applications to such clusters .",
    "( c ) applying the quasi - chemical theory to such large clusters demands consideration of packing effects .",
    "this latter issue is actively under study at present ( ashbaugh and pratt , in preparation ) .",
    "the neglect of packing aspect is certainly one the reason underlying the merely fair agreement for the [ @xmath34@xmath5 thermochemistry .",
    "it is also likely that anharmonic effects are non - negligible for clusters such as @xmath35 and @xmath36 . but",
