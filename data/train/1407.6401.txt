    "in this article , we investigate the relationship between the topology and dynamics of smale flows on @xmath0 .",
    "a strategy that has been very successful in analyzing smooth flows on manifolds is to consider first , the local dynamics described by the chain recurrent behavior on the basic sets and secondly , to examine how these basic sets fit together",
    ".    our approach will be qualitative in nature and make use of the methods introduced by franks , @xcite and further developed by de rezende , @xcite , in their study of smale flows on @xmath1 and by yu in @xcite in his study of non - singular smale flows on @xmath0 .",
    "our main contribution herein is to consider smale flows on @xmath0 with singularities , which adds considerable difficulty to the embedding problem of the basic blocks containing the basic sets .",
    "a qualitative analysis of a flow on a compact manifold @xmath2 can be divided into two parts , namely , into chain recurrent pieces and and orbits that exhibit gradient - like behaviour among these pieces .",
    "this was very nicely captured in a theorem of conley s @xcite that proves the existence of continuous lyapunov functions for continuous flows @xmath3 .",
    "results of wilson , @xcite , assert that it is possible to choose a smooth lyapunov function @xmath4 .    if @xmath3 is a flow and @xmath5 we say there is an @xmath6-chain from @xmath7 to @xmath8 provided that there exist points @xmath9 and real numbers @xmath10 such that @xmath11 for all @xmath12 a point @xmath7 is called * chain - recurrent * if for any @xmath13 there is an @xmath6-chain from @xmath7 to @xmath7 .",
    "the set of chain recurrent points @xmath14 is called the * chain recurrent set*.    it is easy to see that the chain recurrent set is compact and invariant under the flow .",
    "if @xmath3 is a smooth flow , then a smooth function @xmath15 will be called a * lyapunov function * provided    1 .",
    "@xmath16 if it is not in the chain recurrent set @xmath14 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath17 then @xmath18",
    "if and only if for each @xmath13 there are @xmath6-chains from @xmath7 to @xmath8 and from @xmath8 to @xmath7 .    the qualitative study of flows will first be local in nature , that is , it comprises the analysis of the dynamics of the chain recurrent pieces . in this work ,",
    "for example , dynamical - topological invariants associated to the basic sets will characterize the possible basic blocks that contain them as maximal invariant sets .",
    "the second part , constitutes a global characterization of how these pieces fit together to form the manifold and realize a smooth flow on it .",
    "the question of how the collection of the chain recurrent pieces fit together to form @xmath0 is , in fact , an embedding problem . in this work , as in @xcite and @xcite we make use of a lyapunov graph as a combinatorial tool which gives a global picture of the disposition of the basic sets within the manifold .    for a smale flow @xmath19 on a compact @xmath20-manifold @xmath2 with lyapunov function @xmath15 define the following equivalence relation on @xmath2 : @xmath21 if and only if @xmath7 and @xmath8 belong to the same connected component of a level set of @xmath22",
    "this determines a graph @xmath23 which we say is a * _ lyapunov graph associated to the lyapunov function @xmath22 and the flow @xmath19 _ * if the vertices are labelled with a chain recurrent flow on a compact set and the edges with the genera of the level surfaces given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a regular value .",
    "one should point out that this definition differs from the ones in @xcite and in @xcite since the dynamics under consideration therein , being non - singular , forced the genera to be equal to one in the first case and less than or equal to one in the latter case .",
    "the presence of singularities , as is the case herein , permits level surfaces of all genera . as a guiding principle , the more complicated the flow or if the phase space is higher dimensional",
    ", the more labelling with topological invariants of the associated lyapunov graph may be required in order to obtain meaningful characterization results .",
