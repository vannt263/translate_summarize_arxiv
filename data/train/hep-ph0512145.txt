    "the importance of the transverse - momentum distributions of quarks for a full understanding of the structure of hadrons has been widely recognized in the last decade @xcite . in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) , the @xmath2-dependent distributions give rise to various azimuthal and/or single - spin asymmetries , which are currently under direct experimental scrutiny @xcite .",
    "two leading - twist distributions of great relevance for their phenomenological implications are the sivers function @xmath3 @xcite and its chirally - odd partner @xmath1 , the so - called boer ",
    "mulders function @xcite .",
    "these two distributions describe time - reversal odd correlations between the intrinsic momenta of quarks and transverse spin vectors @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath4 represents an azimuthal asymmetry of unpolarized quarks inside a transversely polarized hadron , whereas @xmath5 represents a transverse - polarization asymmetry of quarks inside an unpolarized hadron .",
    "recently , it has been proven by a direct calculation @xcite that @xmath4 and @xmath5 are non - vanishing : interference diagrams with a gluon exchanged between the struck quark and the target remnant generate non - zero asymmetries .",
    "the presence of a quark transverse momentum smaller than @xmath6 ensures that these asymmetries are proportional to @xmath7 , rather than to @xmath8 , and therefore are leading - twist quantities .",
    "moreover , a careful consideration of the wilson - line structure of @xmath2-dependent parton densities shows that @xmath4 and @xmath5 are not forbidden by time - reversal invariance @xcite ( for a possible chiral origin of these distributions , see @xcite ) .",
    "the sivers function @xmath4 is known to be responsible for a @xmath9 single - spin asymmetry in transversely polarized sidis @xcite .",
    "the boer - mulders function @xmath5 produces azimuthal asymmetries in _",
    "unpolarized _ reactions .",
    "boer @xcite argued that it can account for the observed @xmath10 asymmetries in unpolarized @xmath11 drell - yan processes @xcite .",
    "this was quantitatively confirmed in @xcite , where @xmath5 was calculated in a simple quark - spectator model and shown to explain the drell - yan data fairly well .",
    "a similar @xmath0 asymmetry occurs in unpolarized leptoproduction .",
    "as we shall see , there are three possible mechanisms generating this asymmetry : 1 ) non - collinear kinematics at order @xmath12 @xcite ; 2 ) the leading - twist boer - mulders function @xcite coupling to a specular fragmentation function , the so - called collins function @xcite , which describes the fragmentation of transversely polarized quarks into unpolarized hadrons ; 3 ) perturbative gluon radiation @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the first two sources of the @xmath10 asymmetry , both related to the intrinsic transverse motion of quarks .",
    "they are especially relevant in the hermes kinematic regime ( @xmath13 gev@xmath14 ) , but the boer - mulders contribution , being leading twist , can also survive at higher @xmath15 and partly account for the asymmetry measured by zeus in this domain @xcite .    in recent years , the @xmath10 asymmetry in leptoproduction was phenomenologically studied by some authors @xcite . in @xcite only the @xmath16 term and the perturbative contribution were included , whereas the boer - mulders effect was not considered .",
    "our calculation is more similar to that presented in @xcite , the main differences being that we use a model for @xmath5 adjusted on the drell - yan data @xcite , and compute the asymmetry according to its experimental definition ( which incorporates a cutoff on the transverse momentum of the final hadron ) .",
    "the process we are interested in is unpolarized sidis : @xmath17 the sidis cross section is expressed in terms of the invariants @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we adopt a reference frame such that the virtual photon and the target proton are collinear and directed along the @xmath21 axis , with the photon moving in the positive @xmath21 direction ( fig .",
    "[ plane ] ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath2 the transverse momentum of the quark inside the proton , and by @xmath22 the transverse momentum of the hadron @xmath23 .",
    "the transverse momentum of @xmath23 with respect to the direction of the fragmenting quark will be called @xmath24 .",
