    "over a century ago , boltzmann and gibbs laid the foundations for a comprehensive treatment of all systems in thermal equilibrium .",
    "by contrast , our understanding of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics ( nesm ) is quite primitive . to date ,",
    "an overarching principle remains elusive , even for time - independent ( steady ) states .",
    "yet , such systems are ubiquitous , encompassing all biological systems , for example .",
    "thus , understanding `` physics far from equilibrium '' is recognized as one of the greatest challenges of current condensed matter and materials physics @xcite , with significant implications for technological advances in the sciences and engineering .",
    "faced with such grand vistas , one approach is to focus on simple model systems , with the goal of identifying essential characteristics of nesm that defy our equilibrium - trained expectations and intuitions .",
    "this paper will be devoted to a seminal effort in this direction .",
    "twenty five years - and 50 statistical mechanics meetings - ago , katz , lebowitz and spohn ( kls ) introduced a simple model@xcite , motivated partly by the physics of fast ionic conductors under the influence of an external dc field @xcite .",
    "it involves a seemingly trivial modification of the two - dimensional lenz - ising model@xcite , namely , an interacting lattice gas with _ biased _ hopping along one of the axes .",
    "a brief review of this model is the main theme of this article , dedicated to the celebration of the 100@xmath0 statistical mechanics meeting .",
    "we will recount the many surprises it provided , the numerous variations it spawned , the aspects that are now understood , the puzzles that remain outstanding , as well as some of the general insights on nesm it offered .",
    "a more detailed review of the `` first dozen years of kls '' can be found in @xcite .",
    "the kls and the ising models share many noteworthy features . both represent the barest of essentials for a system with many interacting degrees of freedom to display non - trivial behavior .",
    "each is motivated by physical systems and their interesting properties , e.g. , phase transitions . in the 20 s ,",
    "the ising model was `` scorned or ignored''@xcite as a simple mathematical toy of theorists .",
    "when lenz proposed the model , ising was able to solve it only in one dimension and the resultant lack of a phase transition must have disappointed theorists at the time . with the contributions of many , from onsager@xcite to wilson and fisher@xcite , it became part of well - established text - book material .",
    "not only is it one of the most celebrated models within and beyond theoretical physics , it has been realized physically in several systems@xcite .",
    "fortunately , the kls model enjoyed more respect in its first decade than the ising model did in the 30 s .",
    "unfortunately , a physical realization has yet to be found .",
    "furthermore , it is so challenging that very little is known analytically , even in one dimension . at the `` most fundamental '' level , its stationary distribution is not known , in stark contrast to the explicit @xmath1 $ ] in the ising model in equilibrium .",
    "consequently , most of its macroscopic properties are beyond our analytic abilities and its collective behavior , as discovered through computer simulations , continues to confound our intuitive ideas . in the remainder of this article , we briefly look back on these 25 years and look forward to much more progress on the kls model , as well as non - equilibrium statistical mechanics in general .",
    "the kls model is based on the ising lattice gas @xcite with attractive nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interactions , evolving under particle - hole or spin - exchange @xcite dynamics .",
    "the original study involved square lattices with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) @xcite . here ,",
    "let us consider a slightly more general version , with other bc s on a rectangular lattice with @xmath2 sites ( each of which may be occupied by a particle or left vacant ) .",
    "thus , a configuration is specified by the occupation numbers @xmath3 , where @xmath4 labels a site and @xmath5 is either 1 or 0 .",
    "the interparticle attraction is given by the ising hamiltonian : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are nn sites and @xmath9 . with no drive and coupled to a thermal bath at temperature @xmath10 ,",
    "a half filled system undergoes a second order phase transition at the onsager temperature @xmath11 , from a homogeneous , disordered state to an inhomogeneous state displaying the coexistence of two regions with high and low particle densities . minimizing surface energy ,",
    "each region forms a single strip , parallel to the shorter axis . to simulate the lattice gas ,",
    "a common protocol is to choose a random nn particle - hole pair and exchange them with probability @xmath12 $ ] , where @xmath13 is the change in @xmath14 due to the exchange .",
    "the deceptively simple extension in kls is to bias the particle hops along , say , the @xmath15 axis , so that the new rates are @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "locally , the effect of the `` electric '' field , @xmath17 , is identical to that due to gravity",
    ". however , due to the pbc , this modification can not be accommodated by a ( single - valued ) hamiltonian .",
    "instead , the system settles into a _",
    "non - equilibrium _ stationary state with a non - vanishing global particle current . at first sight",
    ", this kls model appears quite similar to the ising case : for @xmath10 larger than a critical @xmath18 , a half filled system remains in a homogeneous state , while below @xmath18 , the system displays phase segregation . with deeper probing , dramatic differences surface at _ all _ temperatures",
    ". moreover , many properties are entirely counterintuitive . before discussing these surprises ,",
    "let us point out that the usual ising symmetry ( particle@xmath19hole , in the lattice gas language ) is violated by the drive , though the combined operation of particle @xmath19 hole @xmath20 @xmath21 ( known as cp ) is still valid .",
    "a closely related model to kls is the _ randomly driven _ lattice gas ( rdlg ) , in which the sign of @xmath17 is chosen randomly , say , for every hop attempt @xcite .",
    "the effect is similar to a _ two - temperature _ ising lattice gas ( ttlg ) @xcite , in which hops along @xmath22 are coupled to another thermal bath at temperature @xmath23 and updated with @xmath24 $ ] . for either of these , the full ising symmetry is clearly restored . but neither will be comparable to the equilibrium ising model and boltzmann factors will not describe the stationary distributions of any of the driven systems .    returning to kls ,",
    "the first surprise is how @xmath18 varies as @xmath17 is increased . for `` infinite '' @xmath17 , hops aligned with the @xmath15 axis are accepted or rejected _  regardless _ of @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the drive tends to break bonds , impair correlations , and increase disorder ",
    "an effect similar to being coupled to an `` infinite '' temperature bath .",
    "such considerations would lead naturally to the prediction that the internal energy ( average number of broken bonds ) of the system should increase with @xmath17 , so that @xmath18 would decrease .",
    "simulations @xcite showed quite the opposite : @xmath18 increases , saturating at @xmath26 for @xmath27 ! remarkably , this same shift in @xmath18 is also observed in both the rdlg and the ttlg . especially in the ttlg , it is natural to regard our system as coupled to two baths ( with @xmath28 ) . in this sense , we can rephrase the `` first surprise '' as negative response : the internal energy of our system _ decreases _ even though @xmath23 is _",
    "increased_. this kind of `` surprising '' behavior and its origins are now reasonably well understood@xcite , so that arguments can be advanced to predict the class of drives that would lead to increasing / decreasing @xmath18 s .",
    "the general lesson here is that negative responses can be easily induced in nesm systems .",
    "the next surprise for the early investigators is that , for all @xmath29 ( where the system is homogeneous ) , there are long range correlations  despite the interactions and the dynamics being both short ranged .",
    "the origin of the difference between this behavior and that in the equilibrium ising model can be traced to the violation of detailed balance and the fluctuation dissipation relation ( fdr ) . for a system in @xmath30 dimensions with a conserved density , the autocorrelation function is known to decay as @xmath31 .",
    "given the diffusive nature for a non - critical system , the scaling @xmath32 should hold and so , we should expect the equal - time correlation to decay as @xmath33@xcite .",
    "the amplitude of this power turns out to be _ anisotropic _  positive along the direction of the drive and negative otherwise , mimicking a dipolar interaction . in fourier space",
    ", this amplitude transforms into a _ discontinuity _ singularity@xcite of the structure factor @xmath34 at @xmath35 , e.g. , @xmath36 in @xmath37 .",
    "this behavior is `` generic , '' in that @xmath38 is tied to the violation of the fdr . in this sense ,",
    "systems in equilibrium are `` singular , '' since fdr forces @xmath38 to vanish , so that the correlation in the ising lattice gas decays as @xmath39 rather than @xmath33 . to understand these features",
    ", it is straightforward to following the spirit of landau - ginzburg for the ising model and formulate a theory for the coarse grained particle density , @xmath40 . defining @xmath41 , taking into account all anisotropies , and anticipating relevant interactions for @xmath42",
    ", we write the full langevin equation @xmath43 with noise correlations @xmath44 for the @xmath37 case , @xmath45 and @xmath46 reduce to @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "this approach can account for all the novel properties phenomenologically , for example , with @xmath49@xcite .",
    "as @xmath10 is lowered towards @xmath18 , simulations first revealed the onset of phase separation , but only _ transverse _ to the drive , corresponding to a diverging @xmath38 but with @xmath50 remaining finite . as a result",
    ", @xmath51 does not scale naively with the transverse momenta , so that analyses using techniques for `` strong anisotropic scaling '' are unavoidable@xcite .",
    "based on these observations and starting with the langevin equation above , a field theoretic renormalization group analysis can be set up@xcite and , unlike the ising universality class@xcite , the upper critical dimension is @xmath52 .",
    "more significantly , the fixed point can not be written in terms of a `` hamiltonian '' and is genuinely `` non - equilibrium '' in the sense that it contains a term corresponding to a non - trivial ( probability ) current@xcite .",
    "by contrast , a similar treatment for the rdlg leads to a fixed point _",
    "hamiltonian_@xcite , so that its leading singularities fall into the universality class of a system _ in equilibrium_. returning to the kls case , a hidden symmetry associated with the fixed point is identified , so that critical exponents can be calculated _ to all orders _ in @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect these predictions to be reliable down to @xmath37 , without the necessity of borel resummation@xcite",
    ". these novel critical properties are largely confirmed in extensive simulation studies@xcite . despite lingering controversies associated with claims to the contrary@xcite ,",
    "no other field theoretic description is free of deficiencies at the basic level of symmetries@xcite .",
    "= 4.00 in     = 2.00 in     = 1.50 in     most of the surprising - and poorly understood - phenomena appear for @xmath42 .",
    "simulations showed that the ordered state is similar to the one in the ising lattice gas : full phase separation , coexistence of a high - density region ( strip ) with a low - density one , interfaces aligned with the drive . beyond these gross features in kls , none are ising - like and few can be predicted .",
    "focussing on the steady state first , the most prominent feature in a phase segregated system is the interface . for @xmath37 systems in equilibrium",
    ", it is always `` rough , '' i.e. , it behaves like a random walk , with a width @xmath54 that scales as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 . in kls",
    ", simulations revealed that , especially if the drive is large ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 is consistent with zero , i.e. , the interface is `` smooth . ''",
    "since interfaces in equilibrium systems can make transitions ( the roughening transition ) from being rough to smooth , a natural question is whether similar transitions exist for the kls interface . such an issue has never been probed systematically . meanwhile",
    ", the roughening transition in equilibrium is associated with a singularity in the surface tension ( i.e. , interfacial free energy ) as function of @xmath59 , the angle the normal of the interface . whether a similar singularity is present for the kls interface motivated a series of monte carlo studies@xcite of the driven lattice gas with _ shifted _ periodic boundary conditions ( spbc ) , a standard technique for inducing interfaces with various normals .",
    "fig 1(a ) illustrates how `` slanted '' interfaces appear when a shift of 5 is imposed on a @xmath60 lattice .",
    "though there is no well - defined free energy for a system out - of - equilibrium , the internal energy ( @xmath61 ) can be easily measured and a singularity in @xmath59 will also appear in @xmath62 .",
    "the results of these studies led to the next set of surprises provided by the kls model .",
    "first , not only is @xmath63 singular ( @xmath64 discontinuous ) , it is the _ bulk _ energy density that is singular ( in contrast to the ising model with spbc , where the bulk @xmath61 is _ independent _ of @xmath59 ) .",
    "further , as the shift increases , the single `` slanted '' strip breaks up into multiple strips , as illustrated in fig 1(b ) ! note that the `` multi - strip '' configuration is actually a single strip , with multiple _ winding _ around the torus .",
    "finally , as the shift is further increased , the system makes a series of transitions where the winding decreases one by one ( `` @xmath65 strips '' merging into `` @xmath66 strips '' ) ! in other words , there appears to be a series of transitions in the topology of the steady state .",
    "though details remain to be investigated systematically , many aspects of these transitions have been explored ( through simulations of relatively small systems : @xmath67 ) @xcite .",
    "this effort also raised further questions , as more complex phenomena emerged .",
    "for example , an attempt was made at `` catching '' the system at `` the critical angle '' where the first splitting occurs .",
    "illustrated in fig 2 , `` icicles '' ( long triangular domains ) appear on one of the interfaces .",
    "they are `` dynamic , '' continuously growing and shrinking , so that the system suffers anomalously large fluctuations . from these explorations ,",
    "we learn that seemingly trivial modifications of the original kls model lead to highly complex and unexpected phenomena . due to space limitations , we only list a few others here :    * anomalous correlations in interfaces in both kls and the rdlg@xcite * steady states with `` icicles '' in kls with _ open _ boundary conditions ( illustrated in fig .",
    "3)@xcite * `` inverted icicles '' during coarsening process and failures of the continuum theory@xcite * variety of pattern formation and successes of the continuum theory@xcite",
    "most of these phenomena are far from being well understood .",
    "for example , the aspect ratio of the `` icicle '' pattern seems to be controlled by the microscopic parameters ( @xmath68,@xmath17,@xmath10 ) , but remains to be predicted .",
    "in this article , we presented a very brief summary of the surprises provided by the original kls model , i.e. , an ising lattice gas in @xmath37 with uniform and isotropic _ attractive interactions_. thanks to its simplicity , simulation studies were plentiful and contributed much to the excitement associated with novel phenomena . despite its simplicity ,",
    "however , little is known analytically , not even in @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we have learned a great deal from it , from specific issues such as generic long range correlations ( induced by a conservation law ) to a range of general properties associated with ness .",
    "following is a short list of the latter .",
    "( i ) negative responses should not cause a priori alarm , but should be investigated .",
    "( ii ) current loops of probability , mass , energy , etc .  whether local or global  can be expected and carry valuable information on the system .",
    "( iii ) familiar routes of the thermodynamic limit are unlikely to be reliable , while the intuition that provided successful coarse - grained continuum descriptions may lead us astray .",
    "thus , more dependable techniques should be developed to arrive at macroscopic properties and mesoscopic theories .",
    "the overall lesson seems to be : expect the unexpected , whenever one encounters a new ness , no matter how trivially it appears to be related to known systems .",
    "although there has been only limited progress on the original kls model , especially over the last decade , it has spawned considerable activity on several related fronts .",
    "these involve both extensions and simplifications of the original system , the subject of brief notes in the remaining paragraphs .",
    "extensions involve anisotropic jump rates@xcite , anisotropic interactions@xcite , quenched impurities@xcite , multispecies@xcite , multi - layers@xcite , mixtures of dynamics@xcite , to name just a few .",
    "remarkably absent are more studies of systems in @xmath70@xcite , in which new phenomena ( e.g. , shapes of  icicles \" ) can be expected .",
    "not surprisingly , since these models are more complex than kls , even less is known analytically ( except the fast rate limit@xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , through computer simulations , these extensions provided many more surprises , especially when the modifications are so minor that no novel behavior was anticipacted !",
    "such discoveries further challenge our basic understanding of ness : how unpredictably complex phenomena emerge from incredibly simple dynamic rules@xcite .    for models",
    "_ simpler _ than kls , on the other hand , enormous advances on the theoretical front took place .",
    "one outstanding case is a lattice gas with _ no _ attractive interparticle interaction , i.e. , a system of biased random walkers with on - site exclusion only .",
    "the stationary distribution becomes trivially flat for a system with pbc@xcite , though many interesting dynamical properties are present@xcite . with _",
    "open _ boundary conditions , even the stationary distributions are non - trivial , with few studies for systems in two or more dimensions .",
    "if we simplify further and consider _ one - dimensional lattices _",
    "( with open boundaries ) , we find a wealth of analytic results .",
    "known as the asymmetric exclusion process ( asep ) and first introduced in 1970@xcite , its exact stationary state was found@xcite , showing three non - trivial phases as well as unusual dynamics@xcite .",
    "also clarified is its relationship with other exactly solvable non - equilibrium systems , e.g. , the zero range process@xcite .",
    "furthermore , generalizations of asep have been exploited to model physical processes such as protein synthesis ( since 1968@xcite ! ) and vehicular traffic@xcite . enjoying considerable attention , it is the focus of several comprehensive reviews@xcite . of course",
    ", one - dimensional chains can not support many of the interesting features discovered in the kls , e.g. , anisotropic correlations , discontinuity singularities in @xmath34 , and  icicles .",
    "\" nevertheless , we should celebrate these contributions as giant strides towards our understanding of systems driven far from equilibrium .    to conclude ,",
    "we remain hopeful that , before long , another onsager will find an analytic solution to this amazingly rich , yet simple model , thereby shedding light on the secrets of ness in general .",
    "furthermore , our belief is that , like the ising model , it will disperse its fruits far afield , beyond non - equilibrium statistical mechanics to , e.g. , graph theory , quantum field theory , bioscience , neuroscience , sociophysics and econophysics .",
    "+ in addition to dedicating this article to the 100@xmath0 statistical mechanics meeting ( where this material was first presented ) , i thank both joel lebowitz and herbert spohn for many , many illuminating discussions . the support by many collaborators , especially beate schmittmann , and the us national science foundation ( through dmr-0705152 ) is also gratefully acknowledged .",

    "<S> an abundant variety of unexpected behavior emerged and caught many of us by surprise . </S>",
    "<S> we present a brief review of some of the new insights garnered and some of the outstanding puzzles , as well as speculate on the model s role in the future of non - equilibrium statistical physics . </S>"
