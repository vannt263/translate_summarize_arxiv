    "it is very - well known that in general interactions which break the lepton or baryon number ( or r - parity ) are present in any susy extension of the sm .",

    "we conclude that in partial split susy it is possible to generate all neutrino masses and mixing in agreement with the experiments using the bilinear terms alone and the trilinear r - parity violating ( trpv ) couplings are essentially irrelevant .",

    "usually this symmetry is considered as an exact symmetry of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) in order to avoid the dimension four contributions to proton decay and at the same time there is a possibility to have the lightest supersymmetric particle as a good candidate for the cold dark matter of the universe .    in the context of the mssm the so - called r - parity violating terms",

    "there is a second way to avoid these small couplings if the susy breaking scale is large , this is the case of split - susy . since in this case",
