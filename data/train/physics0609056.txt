    "superconducting tunnel junction ( stj ) detectors are among the most advanced cryogenic sensors@xcite with intrinsic spectroscopic resolution and high detection efficiency over a broad energy range .",
    "essential advantages of low - temperature detectors in general are the small energy gap in superconductors compared to standard semiconductors ( typically three orders of magnitude lower ) , decoupling of the electron and phonon systems in normal metals below about @xmath0 , and a vanishing lattice heat capacity .",
    "the lifetime of nonequilibrium quasiparticles generated in superconductors due to local energy deposition in excess of a purely thermal distribution becomes very large at operating temperatures well below the transition temperature .",
    "those quasiparticles can be efficiently detected as a tunnel current in an stj if tunneling rates are high compared to recombination and loss processes . in the tunneling process",
    ", a quasiparticle can tunnel back and contribute many times to the total charge transfer.@xcite this internal amplification process is a unique feature of stjs which significantly improves the sensitivity of the detectors , allowing us to observe single sub - ev energy quanta .    as a next generation detector , stjs are very promising candidates e.g.  for astronomical observations.@xcite in addition to their direct spectroscopic response and high speed ( @xmath1 ) , they can be operated with essentially no dark count rate , which is another enormous advantage compared to ccd imaging systems , making them the favored choice for detection of faint objects . however , to satisfy the desire for detectors with imaging capabilities as offered by ccd cameras , a competitive stj based multipixel camera inevitably faces the complexity of large channel - number readout , i.e.   the problem of transferring the small charge - signals from the cryogenic environment to external room - temperature electronics .",
    "one possible solution to reduce the number of readout lines is by using distributed readout imaging devices ( droids ) , where the quasiparticle distribution in a large superconducting absorber is detected with several stjs at different positions .",
    "this type of detector was investigated with x - rays@xcite as well as with optical photons.@xcite    in this paper we present measurements with quasi - onedimensional droids irradiated with energy quanta covering the ultraviolet ( uv ) and the entire optical range , and including an extension to near infrared ( ir ) energies below @xmath2 . after a description of device properties , experimental conditions and measurement procedure in sec .",

    "the specified spectral widths of the leds were typically a few percent .",
    "the photons were coupled to the detectors via optical fibres and through the sapphire substrate .",
    "back - illumination through the substrate was found to be essential for optimum detector performance , probably thanks to a clean , oxide - free interface , whereas the native tao@xmath28 on top of the absorber appears to be less transparent . the light intensity ( pulse duration )",
    "was adjusted to observe on the order of one photon per pulse .",
    "packets of ( incoherent ) multiple photons were synchronized to a maximum time spread of less than @xmath29 .",
