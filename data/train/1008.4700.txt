    "ultra - short laser pulses are widely used in scientific research ranging from fundamental physics to biology , and find use in many applications such as for material processing or in telecommunications  @xcite . the most common method to generate ultra - short pulses is passive mode - locking because this can yield particularly short pulse durations in the femtosecond range . however , current mode - locking methods place restrictions on the combinations of repetition rates , output powers , and pulse durations that are feasible , because the pulse repetition rate scales inversely with the length of the laser cavity  @xcite .",
    "the connection between repetition rate and cavity length implies that high repetition rate and high average power are incompatible using current approaches . to illustrate this ,",
    "let us consider a very short cavity length of a few hundred @xmath0 , such as can be realized in semiconductor lasers .",
    "indeed , very high repetition rates of hundreds of ghz can be obtained  @xcite .",
    "however , the short cavity length limits the roundtrip gain and average power , typically to the mw - range with such semiconductor lasers . extending the cavity length allows for higher average output power , but also lowers the repetition rate and thereby introduces other limitations .",
    "a first restriction , noticeably in semiconductor lasers , comes from the limited lifetime ( nanoseconds ) of the upper state , such as given by spontaneous emission . at repetition rates of a few ghz and below , amplified spontaneous emission",
    "occurs between pulses  @xcite , which can deplete the inversion and reduce the coherence of the output .",
    "a second restriction is distortion of the pulse shape by dispersion , gain saturation , and other nonlinear effects .",
    "other mode - locked lasers , for instance ti : sappire oscillators , have an average output power limited to a few watts by such effects .    the described incompatibility limits applications where nonlinear processes need to be driven at the highest repetition frequency .",
    "for example , photomagnetic switching  @xcite requires , 50  gw/@xmath1 ( over 100 fs ) to initiate a switching operation . a 1  thz pulse repetition rate laser , focused to a diffraction limited spot , therefore , requires an average power of approximately 10  w , which is well beyond the range of the capabilities of current mode - locked diode lasers  @xcite .",
    "another example is all optical switching  @xcite with similar requirements .",
    "we investigate a novel approach to mode - locking in which multiple single - frequency lasers are phase - locked via a common non - linear optical element .",
    "our approach may be applied to all types of lasers , however , for clarity and relevance , we concentrate on diode lasers . to illustrate the scheme and",
    "investigate its feasibility with current technology , we discuss a specific setup , in the form of an external cavity diode laser using bulk optical elements as shown in fig .",
    "[ figexperimentalsetup ] , although one could also think of other designs , e.g. , using integrated optics .",
    "the gain is provided by a multiple - emitter diode array in which the individual gain elements are sufficiently separated from each other to exclude mutual evanescent coupling .",
    "the array is equipped with a high - reflection ( hr ) back facet and an anti - reflection ( ar ) coated front .",
    "the ar coating avoids etalon effects and ensures that the single emitters amplify light without imposing a longitudinal mode structure .",
    "the cavity contains focusing optics , a diffraction grating and a semiconductor saturable absorber mirror ( sesam  @xcite ) .",
    "the external cavity confines the feedback to each emitter to a narrow frequency range , with a uniform spacing between the frequencies for neighboring elements .",
    "this is achieved by arranging the diffraction grating such that the -1st order diffraction angle is common to all emitters , such as is described in refs .",
    "this common arm of the cavity is closed by the sesam .",
    "each emitter receives feedback which it amplifies , providing a continuous - wave ( cw ) , single - frequency output per emitter .",
    "initially , these frequencies superimpose in the common arm with random relative phases to produce a random temporal variation of the power .",
    "the reflectivity of the sesam depends on the instantaneous intensity , providing relative - phase dependent feedback .",
    "mode - locking is initiated by the sesam becoming saturated , leading to an increased reflectivity when sufficiently many emitters constructively interfere .",
    "this results in increased feedback to the emitters , which drives their mutual phase locking . if the frequencies and phases are locked , a regular train of pulses results in the common arm .",
    "note that in the other arm all emitters remain cw emitters , each at its individual , single frequency .",
    "the output pulse train can be extracted via the 0th diffraction order .",
    "such a separate - gain mode - locked laser would have a number of unusual properties .",
    "while the phases of the cw lasers are mutually locked by the sesam feedback , the frequencies of the individual cw lasers are determined by the dispersion of the grating and the physical spacing between the emitters .",
    "note that these parameters can be designed to select a desired frequency spacing , and thereby repetition rate , independent of the length of the external cavity .",
    "the average power scales with the number of gain elements and is independent of the repetition rate , provided that the peak power remains sufficient to saturate the sesam .",
    "the bandwidth scales as the number of emitters and their frequency separation and , therefore , can be controlled by switching gain elements on and off . a related approach with only partially separated gain",
    "was suggested in  @xcite but did not separate all longitudinal modes so that the gain elements still needed to amplify pulses .",
    "our approach creates pulses by synthesizing a large number of single frequencies  @xcite but without the need for active stabilization or nonlinear conversion .",
    "m apart and have a width of 4  @xmath2 m .",
    "the array has a high - reflection on the back facet _ (",
    "g ) _ and an anti - reflection coating on the front _ ( i)_.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in the following , we present an analytical expression that relates the cavity design parameters to the repetition rate and pulse duration .",
    "we also present calculations of the laser s temporal dynamics , based on amplification and gain saturation in the slowly varying , cw regime for each of the separate gain elements .",
    "these calculations provide the requirements for the sesam to establish mode - locking .",
    "the use of a slowly varying , cw amplifier model for each of the gain elements is justified by the limited frequency range available to each element , which imposes correspondingly slow dynamics .",
    "the dynamics of the sesam are expected to lie in the ultra - fast regime . to account for this",
    "we employ the phenomenological model developed by grange  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite . within this model ,",
    "the sesam is described by its recovery time , @xmath3 , modulation depth , @xmath4 , and the saturation fluence @xmath5 .",
    "the effect of two - photon absorption at high pulse fluences is described with another parameter , @xmath6 .",
    "we expect the requirements for our system to differ from those for conventional mode - locking where the saturation effect of the sesam must exceed the saturation effect of the gain , since the two counteract each other . in conventional mode - locking , the light flow is pulsed throughout the entire cavity .",
    "saturation of the sesam lowers the losses while saturation in the gain material lowers the gain .",
    "the competition of these effects limits the pulse shortening . in our approach ,",
    "no change in gain saturation is experienced in the transition to pulsed operation , because each gain element maintains a cw light field .",
    "consequently , the sesam can operate over a greater range of saturation fluences .",
    "for the practical implementation , such as in fig .",
    "[ figexperimentalsetup ] , we expect that fast recovery times are required because the grating cavity dispersion and diode - element separation imply relatively high repetition rates .",
    "for the theoretical description , we used a plane wave laser model , based on a diode array with a large number of independent , separate single - spatial - mode gain elements . due to the complexity of the laser and its nonlinear dynamics we use numerical modeling .",
    "we base the parameters in our model on a typical single - mode diode laser array that is commercially available ( oclaro , type  spcxxc-980 - 01 ) .",
    "the array contains 49 emitters separated by 200  @xmath2 m , each with a front aperture of 4  @xmath2 m along the slow axis .",
    "the gain material is ingaas with a spectral gain bandwidth of 30  nm around a center wavelength of 975  nm and a maximum output of 1  w cw per element , thus providing a substantial output power of 49  w. the cavity , with a total length of 1  m , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figexperimentalsetup ] , contains a spherical lens ( @xmath7=300  mm , diameter is 50.8  mm ) , a 1800  lines / mm diffraction grating , and a semiconductor saturable absorber mirror ( sesam ) .",
    "the focal length of the second lens @xmath8 is not specified .",
    "instead we vary the fluence on the sesam to represent different focusing conditions and account for losses between the emitters and the sesam .",
    "the frequency separation between the emitted center frequencies of the gain elements can be calculated using the standard expression for the diffraction angles at a grating . in the small - angle approximation ,",
    "the frequency separation between the @xmath9th and @xmath10th gain element , is given by :    @xmath11    with @xmath12 denoting the gain element located in the center of the array ( total number of element equals 2n+1 ) , @xmath13 is the speed of light , @xmath14 is the grating period , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the angle of diffraction of the -1st order compared to the normal of the grating , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the angle of the incident light at the grating originating from the central gain element , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the physical distance between two adjacent gain elements at the diode array and @xmath21 is the distance between the grating and the collimating lens .",
    "note that eq .",
    "[ eq : freqseparation ] is independent of cavity length but is weakly dependent of the incident light frequency , since @xmath18 indirectly depends on frequency .",
    "this means that an equal spacing between the emitters does not yield an equal spacing between adjacent frequencies , as can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ figemittervsdeltaomega ] , where the spacing varies by a few percent . for mode - locked operation , which imposes a precisely equidistant comb of light frequencies ,",
    "this deviation is accommodated for within the angular and spatial acceptance of the gain elements as long as the mark / space ratio is equal to or exceeds the deviation . in our case",
    "the mark / space ratio is 2% ( 4  @xmath2m/200  @xmath2 m ) and the nonlinearity in fig .",
    "[ figemittervsdeltaomega ] is 2% over a limited range .",
    "this means that an equally spaced frequency comb can be achieved over a range of 19  emitters , as indicated by the red lines in fig .",
    "[ figemittervsdeltaomega ] .",
    "however , taking the numerical aperture of the collimation lens into account , the diffraction limited spotsize of the light fed back to the diodes has a ( 1/@xmath22 ) diameter of 7.4  @xmath2 m , which is larger than the emitter aperture .",
    "this causes an overall loss but also an insensitivity to misalignment and allows equidistant comb elements over a larger number of emitters .",
    "for instance , if we consider that only 33% of the maximum modal overlap with the laser aperture is required to ensure lasing at the correct frequency , then an equidistant frequency comb extending over a range of 37  emitters is possible ( effective mark / space of 8% ) .",
    "since diode lasers only need a limited amount of feedback for frequency locking , an even larger range of emitters might be frequency locked in an equally spaced frequency comb . for optimum performance , however , a chirped emitter spacing or suitable correction optics should be employed . in the following calculations , we assume that an ideal equidistant frequency comb is possible .",
    "[ eq : freqseparation ] can thus be seen as an expression to design the repetition rate .",
    "for instance , a more dispersive diffractive grating generates a larger frequency spacing and , therefore , a higher repetition rate .     in eq .",
    "[ eq : freqseparation ] versus the emitter number @xmath9 .",
    "the red dashed line indicates the number of emitters that can be corrected assuming that the mark / space ratio of the emitters is the limiting factor .",
    "the green line indicates the number of emitters that can be corrected assuming that a 33% modal overlap is required to frequency lock the emitter .",
    "these calculations assume that the ideal frequency spacing is 67  ghz.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    for the relation between pulse duration and repetition frequency , we consider the following .",
    "the pulse repetition frequency is given by the frequency spacing , @xmath23 , and the fourier limited pulse duration is determined by the total bandwidth , @xmath24 . therefore , the ratio of the pulse duration and the pulse spacing ( duty cycle ) is fixed and amounts approximately to the inverse number of spaces between the gain elements , i.e. , ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "if a lens system with an adjustable magnification is inserted between the grating and the gain elements , the repetition rate and pulse duration are simultaneously changed . to increase the pulse duration independently of the repetition rate",
    ", a number of the outer elements could be switched off .    for our parameters",
    "the frequency spacing is 67  ghz so that the total bandwidth is 3.3  thz . from this",
    "we obtain a fourier limited pulse duration of approximately 300  fs  fwhm .",
    "[ figblockscheme ] shows the block diagram for our iterative calculation .",
    "we model the field envelope rather than the oscillating field itself ( slowly varying envelope approximation ) , which is equivalent to shifting the frequency of the center array element to zero .",
    "this is justified by the spectral filtering of light by the grating inside the cavity , which reduces the light field oscillation in the single elements to a narrow bandwidth and corresponding slow dynamics .",
    "the model combines two essential physical processes : the interaction of the light with the sesam , which is calculated in the time domain , and the amplification of light in the gain elements , which is calculated in the frequency domain . switching between the frequency and time domain",
    "is done by a discrete fast fourier transform .",
    "both the time and frequency coordinates are represented by an array of @xmath26 elements .",
    "the frequency spacing between each frequency array element is chosen as 6.7  ghz , providing a bandwidth of 110  thz over the total array length .",
    "this bandwidth provides sufficient resolution ( 9.1  fs ) in the time domain to describe the dynamics of the sesam and resolve the pulse shape .",
    "the time array spans 150  ps . the center frequencies of the gain elements are placed 67  ghz ( 10 array elements ) apart , so that the total bandwidth covered by the gain elements is 3.3  thz , which corresponds to 10.5  nm at a center wavelength of 975  nm .",
    "mode - locking will result in 10 pulses within the time - array , all of which are processed in one computational loop .",
    "this choice for the frequency spacing of the gain elements corresponds to the proposed setup as discussed earlier in this paper .",
    "however , the computational frequency resolution is many times less than the cold cavity mode spacing , which is @xmath27150  mhz ( for a 1 m total cavity length ) so that more than 400 pulses occupy the cavity simultaneously rather than 10 .    ) , saturable absorber described in time domain ( sa ) and monitoring the temporal shape of the output ( time trace ) , inverse fourier transformation to the frequency domain ( @xmath28 ) , decomposition into separate spectral field amplitudes ( d ) , and return to the gain elements .",
    "random initial phases are used to model startup of mode - locking from noise.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]      we use a gain profile for each gain element to express two issues : 1 ) the possibility of oscillation on several longitudinal modes per gain element , spaced at 150  mhz .",
    "2 ) the spectral filtering provided by the physical size of the emitters in the diode array and the dispersion by the grating , which we calculated to be covering about 600  mhz . as a result , approximately five modes could oscillate per gain element . to address the first issue",
    ", we allow for five discrete frequencies per element , two `` side modes '' around each `` center mode '' .",
    "our implementation with a 6.7  ghz array spacing rather than 150  mhz frequency spacing is chosen to reduce the calculation time , however , any spacing can be chosen when the locking range  @xcite exceeds the cavity mode spacing .",
    "this is generally fulfilled for diode lasers with external cavities where both the roundtrip loss and roundtrip gain is very high .",
    "we use an rough estimate of 90% loss which includes output coupling , optical waveguide loss @xcite , losses due to limited apertures , modal mismatch of the feedback at the diode laser facets , collimation errors @xcite and the non - saturable losses of the sesam . to address the second issue ,",
    "the side modes are given a lower relative gain than the center mode .",
    "the spectral gain profile for each gain element was chosen as , which we estimated as the frequency dependent decrease in spatial overlap of the center mode and the first and second side modes .",
    "for the overall shape of the gain spectrum , from the -nth to the nth center modes , i.e. , for the total bandwidth of the modeled laser , we assume a flat profile .",
    "this expresses that this bandwidth is substantially smaller than that of the ingaas gain @xcite . outside the emitters",
    "no gain is present .",
    "the spatial separation of the gain per element resembles a perfect inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "this implies an insensitivity to residual etalon effects which are known to disturb mode - locking in the conventional approach .",
    "since we are interested in the dynamics rather than the power , the total amount of power inside the laser is normalized to 49  w ( 1  w per gain element ) without reference to the transverse size .",
    "this is done by normalizing the saturation intensity of the gain to the maximum signal intensity inside the gain element ( based on a power of 1  w ) .",
    "this yields , which normalizes the extractable power @xcite and fixes the relationship between the small signal gain and the saturation intensity .",
    "the remaining degree of freedom is the value of the small signal gain , @xmath29 , which we choose to be a typical value of 100 over the full length of the gain .",
    "roundtrip losses are set to a typical value of 90% and are taken to include all losses as described before .",
    "these losses are applied to all the light that is fed back into the individual gain elements before calculating the gain . for the gain of each individual element",
    "we assume homogeneous broadening which implies that , upon amplification , the center mode and the side modes compete for gain .",

    "this approximation does not strictly conserve energy per roundtrip .",
    "but , in steady - state , the saturation reduces the roundtrip gain to a value of 1 for a per - emitter power of 1  w , conserving power over multiple round trips and therefore the energy .",

    "for all the data reported here , the simulations were terminated at 500 iterations because it was observed that a steady - state was generally reached within 500 iterations . to observe the impact of the initial phases to mode - locking , we ran each simulation multiple times with the same sesam parameters .",
    "simulations were performed for a wide range of the sesam parameters @xmath39 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 . to evaluate the numerous time traces , we defined a criterion for successful mode - locking by comparing each calculated time trace with that of a fourier limited pulse train that possesses the maximum possible peak power .",

    "darker shades represent areas where mode - locking was observed more often .",
    "@xmath55 indicates the most suitable sesam for our laser that is also commercially available at this time , i.e. , the sesam with the highest @xmath4 and the lowest @xmath3 . for comparison ,",
    "the second and third best available sesams are indicated by the @xmath56 @xcite.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    as @xmath39 increases with sharper focusing on the sesam , so does the parameter range for which mode - locking successfully occurs .",
    "this is the case because , for larger @xmath39 , the modulation due to saturation increases , which relaxes the requirements for the modulation depth and response time .",
    "however , it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figresultsavst]_(f ) _ and _ ( g ) _ that a further increased fluence in the sesam ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively ) narrows the mode - locking regime for @xmath4 and @xmath3 again . this can be understood , because in eq .",
    "[ eqtpa ] for values of @xmath57 , two - photon absorption becomes significant enough to reduce the modulation of the reflectivity .",
    "in general , selecting a larger  @xmath4 means that the same reflectivity change , and thus the same effect on the laser dynamics , is reached for a lower fluence , broadening the operating regime for which mode - locking is observed .",
    "similarly , a short  @xmath3 ensures a stronger differential gain for the pulsed state which improves the mode - locking .",
    "current sesams are optimized for the standard approach in mode - locking , i.e. , for rather low ( tens  of  mhz ) repetition rates , so that longer recovery times , in the order of a several  ns , are sufficient to induce mode - locking . in our approach",
    ", the pulse repetition frequencies can be much higher , such as 67  ghz ( pulse spacing 15  ps ) for the laser described here , and significantly shorter recovery times are required . that these can indeed be obtained , though at the expense of a somewhat reduced modulation depth , can be seen in fig .  [ figresultsavst ] .",
    "there , the best commercially available sesams we could identify at this moment for our laser @xcite are indicated as symbols ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) , with a recovery time of about @xmath58 and with modulation depths , @xmath4 , between @xmath59  and  @xmath60 .",
    "the calculations show that such values should suffice for mode - locking if a sufficiently high fluence of the incident pulses , about @xmath46 , can be realized in spite of the high repetition rate .",
    "if we assume a mode area at the sesam of @xmath61 and a typical sesam value for , it would be possible to achieve @xmath46 with a total power of 20  w in the common arm .",
    "this power is a value which is well below the specifications of the diode arrays that we consider here .",
    "this estimate , thus , indicates that our novel mode - locking scheme is just feasible with currently available components .",
    "we have presented a novel approach to mode - locking , based on spatially separated gain elements and passive mode - locking . we have numerically modeled the basic spectral and temporal properties at the example of a multiple element diode laser ( diode laser array ) with an external cavity , containing a diffraction grating and a semiconductor saturable absorber mirror ( sesam ) .",
    "our modeling reveals the influence of the physical properties of the sesam on the feasibility of mode - locking .",
    "the ongoing development of faster sesams with a higher modulation depth @xcite makes it realistic to assume that mode - locking over a wide range of average powers and repetition rates will be achievable .",
    "our approach to mode - locking lifts current limitations on the combination of repetition rate and output power .",
    "although we have used our model to analyze mode - locking of a specific laser , a diode laser array with 49  w average output power , 67  ghz repetition rate and 300  fs pulse duration , the model can also be applied to investigate separate gain mode - locking requirements for other types of lasers or at different combinations of output power , repetition rate and pulse duration ."
