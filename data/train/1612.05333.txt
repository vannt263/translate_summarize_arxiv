    "it has been long noted that the nuclear structural evolution within a major shell is most likely to be driven by the proton - neutron ( @xmath9 ) interaction @xcite .",
    "especially , the @xmath9 interaction between orbits with the same orbital angular momentum ( spin - orbit partners ) plays the key role to control the nuclear deformation and the shell - model configuration mixing @xcite .",
    "empirically , this part of the @xmath9 interaction assigns the same binding energy for each proton - neutron pairing between spin - orbit partners , and thus should be proportional to the @xmath3 product , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 correspond to valence proton and neutron ( hole ) numbers , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , the nuclear shape evolution of doubly even nuclei is conventionally represented by the tendency of their @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 observables .",
    "therefore , these observables are expected to be systematized by the @xmath3 product , as inspired by which , casten proposed the @xmath3 scheme , where these observables were plotted against the @xmath3 product for heavy nuclei , and presents very smooth systematics @xcite .",
    "however , it s still difficult to quantitatively relate the @xmath3 pattern to the @xmath9 interaction or any other critical information for a further microscopic analysis .    to enable the quantitative usage of the @xmath3 scheme",
    ", one can fit the @xmath3 scheme to some presumed formula .",
    "the best - fit parameter may characterize the nuclear region under investigation and help to make prediction .",
    "some efforts have been devoted along this phonological idea .",
    "for instance , even before the @xmath3 scheme was proposed , an empirical and very rough proportional correlation between @xmath13 and @xmath3 was addressed @xcite .",
    "after that , varied descriptions or fittings with linear and exponential functions are proposed , however , without any theoretical derivation @xcite .",
    "it is desirable to find some analytical formula of the @xmath3 scheme derived from , or at least constrained by , some microscopic mechanism .",
    "compared with the regional @xmath3 scheme systematics , on the other hand , some local correlations of neighboring nuclei can be much easier to emerge from analytical microscopic - model deviation @xcite .",
    "this may be attributed to the localization of nuclear models .",
    "if two nuclei locate far away from each other on the nuclear landscape , their theoretical descriptions should be very different in model parameters , even in model frameworks .",
    "thus , no unified nuclear model can directly provide the analytical description of the regional @xmath3 systematics . however , it s still possible to build a bridge between microscopic models and the @xmath3 scheme via local relations of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , along which this work would like to make an attempt .",
    "we make use of local @xmath12 and @xmath13 relations proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which has been carefully verified by experiments @xcite , and successfully applied to data prediction @xcite .",
    "the analytical derivation provides theoretical constraint on the @xmath3 scheme .",
    "this constraint will be tested with available experimental data .",
    "we also develop similar local and regional correlations for the @xmath8 value .",
    "the experimental verification of this @xmath8 systematics proves its validity and practicability .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec . [ for ] , we analytically give the constraint of local @xmath12 and @xmath13 correlations on their @xmath3 scheme .",
    "the reliability of derived formalism is verified in sec .",
    "[ sys ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec - q ] , a new local correlation between @xmath8 values of neighboring nuclei is developed theoretically and confirmed by experimental survey .",
    "its impact on the regional systematics is further emphasized with experiments therein .",
    "we summarized in sec .",
    "@xcite emphasized that @xmath12 and @xmath13 of four neighboring doubly even nuclei follow similar local relations as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are proton and neutron numbers , respectively . to simplify our deviation ,",
    "we take @xmath12 and @xmath13 both as a general function @xmath18 . thus , eq . ( [ pps - for ] ) reduces to a unified local relation as @xmath19 to adopt this local relation in the @xmath3 scheme , we take @xmath10 and @xmath11 as variables of @xmath20 function instead of @xmath16 and @xmath17 . thus , eq . ( [ pps - g ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath21 for all the particle / hole - proton / neutron combinations .",
    "the left of eq .",
    "( [ pps - npnn - for ] ) corresponds to the difference of @xmath22 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath23    @xmath12 and @xmath13 are both systematically controlled by the @xmath3 product , _",
    "@xmath20 is also a function of the @xmath3 product . according to eq .",
    "( [ partial ] ) , we have @xmath24 the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq - partial ] ) is @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are arbitrary constants . in other words , constrained by local correlations of @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    ", they should present linearity in the logarithmically scaled @xmath3 scheme .",
    "the linear correlation of @xmath12 and @xmath13 values defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq - linear ] ) is verified by re - plotting experimental data within the the logarithmically scaled @xmath3 scheme as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig - e2 ] and [ fig - be2 ] , respectively .",

    "[ fig - q](a ) .",
    "this is because of the experimental uncertainty of the @xmath8 measurement for ba isotopes @xcite , where the ambiguity of data interpretation gives two or more @xmath8 values for one nucleus . by excluding these @xmath8 values of ba isotopes ,",
    "the linearity emerges .",
    "furthermore , we believe that the linear systematics of @xmath8 can be adopted to , at some degree , clarify the ambiguity in refs .",

    "[ fig - q](a ) .    for the @xmath29 region ,",
    "the linearity is obvious with no exception .    for the @xmath30 region , a linear tendency except for several pt isotopes ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath32hg , which are also highlighted with blue circles in fig .",
    "[ fig - q](c ) .",
    "the anomaly of pt isotopes in the @xmath3 scheme has been long noted @xcite , and was attributed to the complexity of their nuclear shape .",
    "the @xmath8 value of @xmath32hg is too small to fit the linearity .",
    "actually , this observation is expected according to eq .",
    "( [ eq - q - vib ] ) . for vibrational nuclei ,",
    "as @xmath3 approaching zero , the @xmath8 value should reduce to zero .",
    "we draw a dash line connecting the end of major linearity and the @xmath33 point in fig .",
    "[ fig - q ] , which schematically represents the tendency of @xmath8 values as @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath32hg point locates right on this straight line .",
    "therefore , we believe that the linearity of the @xmath8 systematics may still maintain as @xmath34 , even though it has not be observed yet , due to the lack of experimental data of few - valence - nucleon nuclei .",
    "to summarize , based on local correlations of @xmath12 and @xmath13 values for neighboring nuclei , an analytical constraint on their regional systematics is proposed , that @xmath12 and @xmath13 should be linearly correlated in the logarithmically scaled @xmath3 scheme . from the axially - symmetric - rotor and anharmonic - vibrator models , a similar local correlation of the @xmath8 value is also obtained , and thus the regional linearity of the @xmath8 systematics is also expected in the @xmath3 scheme .",
    "we verifies the local correlation of @xmath8 values and the linear systematics of @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath8 values with experimental data . except several explainable exceptions , the general existence of the local correlation and linearity is confirmed .",
    "we preform linear fitting to the @xmath12 and @xmath13 experimental data .",
    "the change of dominant collective pattern and the stabilization of nuclei deformation is quantitatively determined to occur at @xmath5 and 90 , respectively .",
    "such information used to be difficult to be obtained in the conventional @xmath3 scheme .",
    "the linear correlation of @xmath8 systematics is also adopted to clarify the ambiguity of the experimental @xmath8 measurement of ba isotopes . in a word",
    ", the linearity in the @xmath3 scheme provides a clearer vision to the nuclear structural evolution , and enables a more sensitive measure to verify or predict experimental data .",
