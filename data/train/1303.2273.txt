    "this count is not well - defined because of potential contributions from the reducible solutions to the equations as one varies the metric and perturbation in a one - parameter family ; this issue is analogous to the one we encounter in the @xmath6-dimensional case when @xmath7 . to get a diffeomorphism invariant ,",
    "chen and lim ( independently , following a suggestion of kronheimer ) added a correction term which is a combination of @xmath8invariants of atiyah  patodi ",

    "singer boundary conditions .",
    "our correction term is similar to that of chen and lim but requires a considerably more complicated analytical setting because our definition involves the spin dirac operator on a non - compact manifold with a periodic end .",
    "a fundamental analytical issue is therefore ensuring that this dirac operator is fredholm and hence has a well - defined index . in dealing with this issue , we relied on the study of the fredholm properties of elliptic operators on manifolds with periodic ends initiated by taubes @xcite .",

    "our interest in seiberg  witten invariants of manifolds with the homology of @xmath4 is mainly explained by the prominent role these manifolds play in low - dimensional topology : several outstanding problems concerning homology cobordisms and the rohlin invariant can be translated using the doubling construction to problems about a homology @xmath4 .",
