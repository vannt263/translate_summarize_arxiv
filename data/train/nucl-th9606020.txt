    "_ do quarks play an important role in finite nuclei ? _",
    "this is one of the central questions in nuclear physics .",
    "we now know that explicit quark degrees of freedom are certainly needed to understand deep - inelastic scattering at momentum transfers of several gev , e.g. , the nuclear emc effect@xcite . however , it is perhaps not surprising that such physics seems irrelevant at a scale of a few tens of mev , and the idea that the quark structure of the nucleon should be of any importance in nuclear physics is often dismissed out of hand .    within the traditional approach to nuclear physics",
    "these tens of mev are the result of a fairly fine - tuned cancellation between short - range repulsion , fairly strong intermediate range attraction and large kinetic energy .",
    "nearest neighbour nucleons in nuclear matter tend to be an average 1.8 fm apart , which corresponds to the intermediate range attraction associated with two - pion - exchange .",
    "this attraction is mainly generated by the coupling to the @xmath6 ( through the process nn @xmath7 n@xmath8 nn ) , which is just the first excited state of the internal quark structure of the nucleon , namely spin - flip .",
    "of course , one can treat the nn @xmath7 n@xmath6 system in a coupled channels formalism without ever mentioning quark structure .",
    "one can even replace the n@xmath6 coupling by simple scalar meson ( @xmath0 ) exchange without significantly altering the binding energy of nuclear systems . if this were the full story quarks would be irrelevant .    however , it is well known that two - body interactions alone can not reproduce either the saturation properties of nuclear matter or the binding energies and charge radii of finite nuclei .",
    "one needs some form of three - body force , and this leads to a nightmare of badly known form - factors and coupling constants , of inconsistent treatments of the @xmath9n , nn and nnn systems , and so on@xcite .",
    "conventional descriptions of finite nuclei are usually based on the schrdinger equation which involves nucleons interacting through static potentials .",
    "these effective potentials are sometimes determined partly by the brueckner - hartree - fock equations , and often involve some phenomenological dependence on the nuclear density to include the effect of higher - order contributions to the n - n force in nuclei@xcite .",
    "those density - dependent potentials are however _ purely phenomenological_. although those conventional approaches give rather successful results for the ground states of nuclei , discrepancies between experimental data and theoretical calculations still remain .",
    "furthermore , there are several problems at a low energy scale , which might not be explained by the traditional approach .",
    "one example is the okamoto - nolen - schiffer ( ons ) anomaly@xcite , which is a well known , long - standing problem in nuclear physics .",
    "conventional nuclear contributions to the anomaly are thought to be at the few percent level and can not explain the experimental findings@xcite .",
    "the effects of charge symmetry breaking in the nuclear force , especially @xmath2-@xmath1 mixing , seem to reduce the discrepancy@xcite .",
    "however , recent investigations of the off - shell variation of the @xmath2-@xmath1 mixing amplitude have put this explanation into question@xcite .",
    "another example concerns the unitarity of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements .",
    "there is also a well known discrepancy between the value of the fermi decay constant extracted from super - allowed fermi beta - decay of nuclear isotriplets and that required by unitarity of the ckm matrix .",
    "this discrepancy remains at the level of a few tenths of a percent ( but beyond two standard deviations from the experimental data ) after the most rigorous investigation of conventional nuclear and radiative corrections@xcite .",
    "these facts seem to indicate that the traditional approach may have its limitations and suggest a need for the study of alternate approaches including sub - nucleonic degrees of freedom .    exciting a single quark in the nucleon costs about 400 mev .",
    "this is not significantly different from the energy required to excite a @xmath6 .",
    "it is the same order of magnitude as the scalar and vector potentials required in quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd)@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the quarks are very light and should be able to respond rapidly to their environment .",
    "_ we know of no physical argument why this response should be ignored . _    about eight years ago guichon@xcite proposed an entirely different model for nuclear matter , based on a mean - field description of nucleons described by the non - overlapping mit bag model , namely the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model .",
    "later this model was refined by saito and thomas@xcite who clarified its relationship to qhd .",
    "related work has been carried out by a number of groups@xcite .",
    "the qmc model may be viewed as an extension of qhd in which the nucleons still interact through the exchange of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons . however , the mesons couple not to point - like nucleons but to confined quarks . in studies of infinite nuclear matter@xcite it was found that the extra degrees of freedom provided by the internal structure of the nucleon mean that one gets quite an acceptable value for the incompressibility once the coupling constants are chosen to reproduce the correct saturation energy and density for symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "this is a significant improvement on qhd at the same level of sophistication .",
    "a wonderful feature of this picture is that most specific details of the model are irrelevant .",
    "for example , it does not matter that one uses the mit bag model , all that is needed is that the quarks are relativistic .",
    "it does not matter that the @xmath1 generates the repulsion ,",
    "all that is needed is that it has a vector character .",
    "there have been several interesting applications to the properties of finite nuclei using the local - density approximation .",
    "surprisingly , the model can provide a semi - quantitative explanation of the ons anomaly when quark mass differences are included@xcite .",
    "an application of the model , including quark mass differences , has also suggested a previously unknown correction to the extraction of the ckm matrix element , @xmath10 , from super - allowed fermi beta - decay , which would bring the discrepancy in the unitarity problem of the ckm matrix back to only one standard deviation@xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the light of current experimental work in relativistic heavy ion collisions@xcite , which produce nuclear matter at densities several times normal , there has been some initial work on the variation of baryon and meson properties with density@xcite .",
    "finally the model has been applied to the case where quark degrees of freedom are undisputedly involved  namely the nuclear emc effect@xcite .    however , the inherent problems of the local - density approximation mean that these applications can at best be semi - quantitative and it was clearly very important that the extension to finite nuclei be developed .",
    "recently we have succeeded in developing a formulation of the quark - meson coupling model for finite nuclei@xcite , based on the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "the effective equation of motion for the nucleon , as well as self - consistent equations for the meson mean fields have been derived .",
    "we have also shown some initial results for @xmath4o and @xmath3ca , and discussed , in particular , the spin - orbit force in the model and its relation to the corresponding force in conventional models involving meson exchange between point - like nucleons .",
    "related work has been carried out by several groups@xcite .",
    "our aim in this paper is to show details of our calculations for the properties of spherically symmetric , closed - shell nuclei from @xmath4o to @xmath5pb .    in sect.[qmc ]",
    "we briefly summarize the qmc model for both infinite nuclear matter and finite nuclei .",
    "starting from the lagrangian density proposed in ref.@xcite we derive the dirac equation for the nucleon and the equations for the meson fields in mean - field approximation and discuss the effective @xmath0-n coupling constant .",
    "the properties of infinite nuclear matter are then reviewed briefly in sect.[matter ] .",
    "we introduce the couplings of the @xmath2 meson and the photon to the quarks , in sect.[fnt ] , in order to describe realistic finite nuclei , and again derive explicit forms for the equations of motion of the nucleon and the mesons . in sect.[results ] , the parameters in our calculations are determined so as to reproduce the rms charge radius of @xmath3ca , and then our calculated results are compared with those of qhd and the experimental data .",
    "our results agree with data favorably .",
    "we give a summary and discuss some remaining problems and some possible extensions in sect.[discuss ] .",
    "the solution of the general problem of a composite , quantum particle moving in background scalar and vector fields that vary with position is extremely difficult .",
    "one has a chance to solve the particular problem of interest to us , namely light quarks confined in a nucleon which is itself bound in a finite nucleus , only because the nucleon motion is relatively slow and the quarks highly relativistic .",
    "thus the born - oppenheimer approximation , in which the nucleon internal structure has time to adjust to the local fields , is naturally suited to the problem .",
    "it is relatively easy to establish that the method should be reliable at the level of a few percent@xcite .    even within the born - oppenheimer approximation ,",
    "the nuclear surface gives rise to external fields that may vary appreciably across the finite size of the nucleon . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "our approach was to start with a classical nucleon and to allow its internal structure ( quark wavefunctions and bag radius ) to adjust to minimise the energy of three quarks in the ground - state of a system consisting of the bag plus constant scalar and vector fields , with values equal to those at the centre of the nucleon .",
    "of course , the major problem with the mit bag ( as with many other relativistic models of nucleon structure ) is that it is difficult to boost .",
    "we therefore solve the bag equations in the instantaneous rest frame ( irf ) of the nucleon  using a standard lorentz transformation to find the energy and momentum of the classical nucleon bag in the nuclear rest frame .",
    "having solved the problem using the meson fields at the centre of the @xmath11nucleon  ( which is a quasi - particle with nucleon quantum numbers ) , one can use perturbation theory to correct for the variation of the scalar and vector fields across the nucleon bag . in first order perturbation theory only the spatial components of the vector potential give a non - vanishing contribution .",
    "( note that , although in the nuclear rest frame only the time component of the vector field is non - zero , in the irf of the nucleon there are also non - vanishing spatial components . )",
    "this extra term is a correction to the spin - orbit force , which is however very small@xcite .",
    "blunden and miller@xcite have also investigated the qmc model for finite nuclei recently .",
    "they too reported that the correction due to the variation of meson fields inside the nucleon is not large .",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite , the basic result in the qmc model is that , in the scalar ( @xmath0 ) and vector ( @xmath1 ) meson fields , the nucleon behaves essentially as a point - like particle with an effective mass @xmath12 , which depends on the position through only the @xmath0 field , moving in a vector potential generated by the @xmath1 meson . because of the vector character , the vector interactions have _ no effect on the nucleon structure _ except for an overall phase in the wave function , which gives a shift in the nucleon energy .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to consider static , spherically symmetric nuclei , the effective lagrangian density involving the quark degrees of freedom and the meson fields in mean - field approximation would be given by@xcite _",
    "qmc^0 & = & [ i - m_n^((r ) ) - g_(r ) _ 0 ] + & - & [ ( ( r))^2 + m_^2 ( r)^2 ] + [ ( ( r))^2 + m_^2 ( r)^2 ] , [ relat ] where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively the nucleon , @xmath0 and the time component of @xmath1 fields .",
    "( in the mean field approximation , the meson fields are given by their time independent expectation values in the ground state of the nucleus .",
    "for a symmetric , parity - eigenstate , the spatial component of the @xmath1 field vanishes . ) @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the masses of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons .",
    "@xmath18 is the @xmath1-n coupling constant ( which is related to the corresponding quark-@xmath1 coupling constant , @xmath19 , as @xmath20@xcite ) .",
    "the effective nucleon mass @xmath12 is given by a model describing the nucleon structure and it depends on the position through only the @xmath0 field ( as mentioned above ) .",
    "we use the mit bag model in this paper .",
    "( a relativistic oscillator model has also been used in ref.@xcite as an alternative model . )",
    "if we define the field - dependent @xmath0-n coupling constant , @xmath21 , by m_n^((r ) ) m_n - g_((r ) ) ( r ) , [ coup ] where @xmath22 is the free nucleon mass , it is easy to compare with qhd@xcite .",
    "the lagrangian density then becomes _ qmc^0 & = & [ i - m_n + g_((r ) ) ( r ) - g_(r ) _ 0 ] + & - & [ ( ( r))^2 + m_^2 ( r)^2 ] + [ ( ( r))^2 + m_^2 ( r)^2 ] .",
    "[ relat2 ] the difference from qhd clearly lies in the fact that the internal structure of the nucleon has forced a _ known _ dependence of the @xmath0-n coupling constant on the scalar field itself .",
    "( note that this dependence is not the same as that adopted in the density - dependent hadron field theory@xcite where the meson - nucleon vertices are assumed to depend directly on the baryonic densities . )",

    "the results for @xmath42 and @xmath43 are shown in table  [ b , z ] .",

    "]     since the calculated properties do not depend strongly on @xmath35 and @xmath29 , we only list the values for the qmc model with @xmath35 = 5 mev and @xmath29 = 0.8 fm .",
    "references for the experimental values can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "while there are still some discrepancies between the results and data , the present model provides quite reasonable results .",
    "in particular , it gives much larger binding energies per nucleon than those of qhd while still reproducing the rms charge radii for medium and heavy nuclei quite well .    in figs.[casp2 ] and",
    "[ pbsp2 ] , the calculated spectra of @xmath3ca and @xmath5pb are presented .    because of the relatively smaller scalar and vector fields in the present model than in qhd , the spin - orbit splittings are smaller .",
    "the improvement over qhd in the binding energy per nucleon comes at the expense of a reduction in the spin - orbit force .",
    "we should note that there is a strong correlation between the effective nucleon mass and the spin - orbit force .",
    "this problem is also discussed in refs.@xcite .    as a test of the sensitivity of the spin - orbit splitting to features of the model",
    ", we consider the case of a larger quark mass ( noting that the born - oppenheimer approximation requires that the nucleon motion is relatively slow and the quarks are highly relativistic ) .",
    "for example , we have calculated the case @xmath35 = 300 mev ( and @xmath29 = 0.8 fm ) which is a typical constituent quark mass .",
    "the calculated spectra for @xmath35 = 300 mev are also illustrated in figs.[casp2 ] and [ pbsp2 ] ( qmch ) . in this case , the various parameters were @xmath44 = 5.58 , @xmath45 = 8.51 ( to satisfy the saturation condition ) , @xmath46 = 6.45 , @xmath16 = 497 mev ( to fit the rms charge radius of @xmath3ca ) , @xmath47 = 334 mev and @xmath12 = 674 mev at saturation density .",
    "we should record that the bag radius in this case increases by 7% at saturation density ( which is uncomfortably large ) .",
    "the slope parameter in eq.([paramc ] ) is @xmath48 .",
    "one can expect that a heavy quark mass gives a spectrum closer to those of qhd@xcite .",
    "we can see from the figures that the calculated spectra are somewhat closer to the experimental data .",
    "we note that the charge density distributions for @xmath3ca and @xmath5pb are also reproduced well in this case .",
    "starting with the quark - meson coupling model , in which quarks confined in nucleon bags interact through the exchange of scalar and vector mesons , we have presented a generalisation of qhd with a @xmath0 field - dependent scalar coupling to describe finite nuclei quantitatively .",
    "the physical origin of this field - dependence , which provides a new saturation mechanism for nuclear matter , is the relatively rapid increase of the lower dirac component of the wavefunction of the confined , light quark .",
    "we have then derived a set of coupled non - linear differential equations which must be solved self - consistently but which are not much more difficult to solve than the relativistic hartree equations of qhd .",
    "our calculations for static , closed - shell nuclei from @xmath4o to @xmath5pb reproduce fairly well the observed charge density distributions , neutron density distributions etc",
    ".    it will be very interesting to explore the connection between the @xmath0 field - dependence of the variation of the effective @xmath0-n coupling constant , which arises so naturally here , and the variation found empirically in earlier work .",
    "we note , in particular , that while our numerical results depend on the particular model chosen here ( namely , the mit bag model ) , the qualitative features which we find ( such as the @xmath0 field - dependent decrease of the scalar coupling etc . )",
    "will apply in _ any model _ in which the nucleon contains light quarks and the attractive n - n force is a lorentz scalar .",
    "of course , it will be important to investigate the degree of variation in the numerical results for other models of nucleon structure@xcite .    in the present model",
    "there are , however , still some discrepancies in energy spectra of nuclei , in particular , the spin - orbit splittings . in the previous section",
    "we have briefly discussed one possibility to partly overcome this defect in the present model . as an alternative approach , jin and jennings@xcite and blunden and",
    "miller@xcite have considered variations of the bag constant @xmath42 and @xmath49 parameter in nuclear matter , which have been suggested by the fact that quarks are presumably deconfined at high enough densities .",
    "this was taken to suggest that @xmath42 might decrease with increasing density .",
    "adopting this idea , blunden and miller@xcite have studied properties of both nuclear matter and finite nuclei . in their approach , @xmath42 in matter , @xmath50 , is given by b^ = b , [ b * ] where @xmath51 is an average scalar potential and @xmath52 is an arbitrary parameter . for finite nuclei",
    "the results move towards those of qhd , and there is an improvement in the spin - orbit splittings . however , the nuclear incompressibility , @xmath47 , is again larger than the experimental data , and the bag radius at saturation density increases by 5% @xmath53 13%@xcite or more@xcite , which seems uncomfortably large@xcite .",
    "we probably ought to construct a formalism beyond the hartree approximation for this class of models in the future .    in this work we have not considered any effect of a decrease of the meson masses in nuclear matter .",
    "( in ref.@xcite these effects were investigated in infinite nuclear matter , using an earlier version of the model . ) the @xmath0-meson mass which we found it necessary to use in this paper ranges from 400 @xmath53 450 mev .",
    "it seems rather small compared with the empirical @xmath0-mass in the obep analyses of the free nn force @xcite . on the other hand , noting its origin in two - pion - exchange with n-@xmath6 intermediate states , we observe that the n-@xmath6 mass difference would decrease in medium by a similar percentage",
    ". it will be interesting , in future work , to incorporate a self - consistent reduction of the vector - meson mass @xcite ( as well as the scalar - meson mass@xcite ) into the calculation of the properties of finite nuclei .",
    "the successful generalisation of the qmc model to finite nuclei opens a tremendous number of opportunities for further work .",
    "for example , earlier results for the okamoto - nolen - schiffer anomaly@xcite , the nuclear emc effect@xcite , the charge - symmetry violating correction to super - allowed fermi beta - decay@xcite and so on , can now be treated in a truly quantitative way . since the present model can provide self - consistent quark wave functions in a deeply bound nucleon , e.g. , @xmath54 in @xmath5pb",
    ", it would also be very interesting to investigate variations in magnetic moments , @xmath55 and so on , for such nucleons@xcite .    for hypernuclei the natural extension ( see ref.@xcite ) is to assume that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons couple only to the non - strange constituents .",
    "from our discussion of the spin - orbit force in ref.@xcite and the fact that the spin of the @xmath56 is carried entirely by the strange quark , one can easily see that the @xmath56 spin - orbit force will arise entirely from the thomas precession term .",
    "this means that the @xmath56 spin - orbit force is very naturally suppressed in this model  as observed experimentally",
    ". it will be important to follow this observation with quantitative results .    finally , we list a number of important ways in which this model could be extended : replacing the mit bag by a model respecting pcac ( e.g. , the cloudy bag model@xcite ) ; replacing @xmath0-exchange by two - pion exchange ; replacing @xmath1 exchange by nucleon overlap at short distance , and so on . in terms of",
    "further theoretical development it will also be interesting to compare the present model with more phenomenological , non - linear extensions of qhd  as reviewed recently in ref.@xcite .",
    "on the practical side , we stress that the present model can be applied to all the problems for which qhd has proven so attractive , with very little extra effort",
