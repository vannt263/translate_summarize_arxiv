    "lattice studies of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) exhibit a chiral symmetry restoring , deconfining transition around a temperature @xmath9 mev ( for ( net ) baryon - free matter ) @xcite . the only possibility to study this transition and the properties of the high - temperature phase of nuclear matter , the so - called quark ",
    "gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite , under laboratory conditions is via relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments @xcite .",
    "promising signals for the detection of the qgp emerge from the influence of the qcd equation of state ( eos ) on the collective dynamical evolution of the many - particle system .",
    "such signals have to be studied via relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite , since that is the only dynamical model which provides a direct link between collective motion and the eos of strongly interacting matter .",
    "for instance , it was shown in @xcite that the qcd transition softens the eos in the transition region and therefore reduces the tendency of matter to expand .",
    "this has two important consequences . on one hand ,",
    "the expansion of the system is delayed and its lifetime is considerably prolonged @xcite . on the other hand",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the reduced expansion tendency of matter leads to a reduction of the transverse directed flow in semi - peripheral heavy - ion collisions .",
    "in @xcite the hydrodynamic flow pattern was studied for spherically symmetric ( so - called `` fireball '' ) expansion as well as for cylindrically symmetric transverse expansion with longitudinally boost - invariant initial conditions ( so - called `` bjorken cylinder '' expansion ) , both as a function of the initial energy density @xmath3 and a possible finite width @xmath10 of the qcd transition region .",
    "the qcd transition was shown to considerably prolong the lifetime of the expanding system as compared to the expansion of an ( ultrarelativistic ) ideal gas , provided the initial energy density lies in a certain range of values .",
    "this range corresponds to ags initial energy densities for the fireball geometry , and rhic initial energy densities for the bjorken cylinder geometry ( for realistic values of the initial thermalization time scale @xmath11 ) .",
    "motivated by pratt s and bertsch s conjecture @xcite , it was shown in @xcite , that for both geometries the prolongation of the lifetime could be experimentally observable via the ratio @xmath4 of the inverse widths of the two  particle correlation functions in out and side  direction , since this ratio follows the behaviour of the lifetimes rather closely .    in this paper",
    "we extend the investigations of @xcite for the bjorken cylinder geometry in two ways .",
    "first , we study two  kaon in addition to two  pion interferometry .",
    "while pion correlation functions are contaminated to a large extent by resonance decays , one expects these to be of minor influence in the case of kaons @xcite .",
    "in addition , neutral kaon correlation functions are , in contrast to the pionic ones , not distorted by final state coulomb effects which introduce an additional uncertainty in experimental data .",
    "second , we now present a systematic study of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and their ratio as a function of initial energy density @xmath3 _ and _ of the mean transverse pair momentum @xmath2 at midrapidity . as in @xcite , we take an eos with a first order phase transition ( @xmath12 ) as well as an eos with a finite width @xmath13 ( as an upper limit deduced from qcd lattice calculations @xcite ) , and compare the enhancement of @xmath4 relative to the ideal gas case .    we find that the excitation function of @xmath4 for kaons again mirrors closely that of the lifetime of the system , and has a maximum around the same initial energy density @xmath3 as for pions .",
    "due to kinematical reasons the ratio is , however , somewhat smaller for kaons with small average transverse pair momentum @xmath14 mev as compared to the pion case . on the other hand , for high @xmath15 gev , it is nearly of the same order as that for pions .",
    "we also study separately the dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 on @xmath3 and @xmath16 .",
    "as expected , these quantities in general decrease with increasing @xmath16 at fixed @xmath3 .",
    "an important exception is the situation around values of @xmath17 , where the time  delay signal is most pronounced . for these initial energy densities and in the case of a first order transition , @xmath12 , we find that @xmath0 actually increases as a function of @xmath16 , both for pions and kaons .",
    "we analyze this behaviour in detail studying the emission function and its variances @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly discuss the hydrodynamic model , the eos used , and the basic formulae to derive single inclusive particle spectra and two  particle correlation functions from the hydrodynamic solution . in section 3",
    "we present our results .",
    "a summary and conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "an appendix contains technical details on the calculation of the variances of the emission function .",
    "natural units @xmath18 are used throughout this work .",
    "hydrodynamics is equivalent to local conservation of energy and momentum , @xmath19 plus additional conservation equations for the ( net ) 4current of any conserved charge in the system .",
    "the latter will not be considered here , since our focus of interest , the central ( rapidity ) region of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions , is expected to be essentially free of ( net ) charges due to the limited nuclear stopping power .    in order to solve the relativistic hydrodynamic equations ( [ dtmunu ] ) we make the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium , the so - called `` ideal fluid approximation '' .",
    "this approximation , although commonly employed throughout the literature , is rather restrictive , since the fluid is certainly out of thermodynamic equilibrium in the early and late stages of a heavy - ion collision . on the other hand , a commonly accepted , causal theory of dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics , which would account for non - equilibrium phenomena , does not yet exist @xcite . for the moment we have to rely on the assumption that ( local ) thermalization does indeed occur after the initial pre - equilibrium stage which is dominated by ( hard ) parton  parton scattering processes ( for collisions at rhic energies ) .",
    "arguments in favour of this assumption are made in @xcite .",
    "we then describe the system s evolution from this point on via ideal fluid - dynamics , until dissipative effects in the final stages prior to decoupling become large and the assumption of local thermodynamical equilibrium again breaks down .    in the ideal fluid approximation , the energy ",
    "momentum tensor reads @xcite @xmath20 here , @xmath21 are energy density and pressure in the rest frame of the fluid , while @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the 4velocity of the fluid and the metric tensor , respectively ( @xmath24 is the 3velocity , @xmath25 is the gamma factor ) .",
    "our model for the dynamics of central ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions is the so - called `` bjorken cylinder '' expansion @xcite , i.e. , it assumes cylindrical symmetry perpendicular to the beam axis ( taken to be the @xmath26axis throughout this work ) and a scaling solution for the longitudinal expansion ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "note that due to the details of the mini - jet production mechanism , these assumptions about the symmetries of the system are not valid per single event @xcite . on the other hand , they seem quite reasonable on an event - average basis .    a consequence of longitudinal scaling is boost  invariance along the beam axis .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to solve the system of four hydrodynamic equations ( [ dtmunu ] ) at @xmath28 , where it reduces to @xmath29 & = & -\\ , \\left ( \\frac{\\beta}{r } + \\frac{1}{t } \\right ) ( e + p)\\ , \\ , , \\\\",
    "\\partial_t\\ , m + \\partial_r\\ , ( m{\\beta}+p ) & = & -\\ , \\left ( \\frac{\\beta}{r } + \\frac{1}{t } \\right ) m\\ , \\ , . \\label{eom2b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath30 is the radial component of the transverse velocity , and we used the definitions @xmath31 ( @xmath32 as index for the radial component of the energy  momentum tensor ) . in order to solve the ( effectively ( 1 + 1)dimensional ) system ( [ eom2a],[eom2b ] ) , we apply the same scheme used in @xcite ,",
    "i.e. , we employ sod s operator splitting method @xcite to account for the source terms on the right - hand side , and the numerically well - tested relativistic hlle algorithm @xcite for the one  dimensional hydrodynamic transport on the left - hand side of ( [ eom2a],[eom2b ] ) .",
    "the hlle scheme was shown to yield excellent results in particular for equations of state with phase transitions @xcite .      as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the advantage of hydrodynamics to model the dynamics of relativistic heavy - ion collisions is that this is the only approach which directly relates observable collective flow phenomena to the eos of hot and dense nuclear matter . formally , specifying an eos closes the coupled system of hydrodynamic equations . in the particular case of vanishing conserved ( net ) charges considered here",
    ", the system ( [ eom2a],[eom2b ] ) is closed by an eos of the form @xmath33 . in the ideal fluid approximation the emerging flow pattern",
    "is completely determined by the choice of this eos and the initial conditions .    in the present work we study hydrodynamic expansion for three different equations of state .",
    "the simplest one is the eos of an ultrarelativistic ideal gas , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the velocity of sound .",
    "this is commonly taken to be a reasonable first approximation for a hadronic matter eos in the central region of an ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collision , since here the system is hot , @xmath36 , and thus dominated by pions , which are the lightest hadrons .",
    "the eos ( [ eos1 ] ) has a constant pressure gradient @xmath37 for all energy densities .    to study the effects of a ( phase ) transition to qgp on the dynamics of the system , we use the following parametrization of the entropy density as function of temperature @xcite , @xmath38 ^ 3 \\left ( 1 + \\frac{d_{\\rm q}-d_{\\rm h}}{d_{\\rm q}+d_{\\rm h } } \\ , \\tanh \\left [ \\frac{t - t_c}{\\delta t } \\right ] \\right)~.\\ ] ] here , @xmath39 is the entropy density at the critical temperature @xmath40 , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the number of ( massless ) degrees of freedom in the qgp and the hadronic phase , respectively ( we fix @xmath43 and @xmath44 throughout this work , for the effect of other choices on the dynamics of the system , see @xcite ) .",
    "the function @xmath45 then follows from thermodynamical relations and is used in the hydrodynamic model in tabular form .",
    "( [ eos23 ] ) accounts for a possible finite width @xmath10 of the transition .",
    "present qcd lattice data @xcite indicate @xmath46 .    in the limit @xmath12 , eq .",
    "( [ eos23 ] ) exhibits a first order phase transition between an ultrarelativistic gas of hadrons described by the eos ( [ eos1 ] ) , and a ( net ) baryon - free qgp consisting of gluons and @xmath47 and @xmath48 quarks ( and antiquarks ) described by the well - known mit bag eos @xcite .",
    "energy density and pressure in the qgp phase are then @xmath49 , @xmath50 , while the corresponding quantities in the hadronic phase are @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53   t_c s_c$ ] is the mit bag constant , if one measures energy densities in units of the critical enthalpy density @xmath54 ( @xmath55 is the pressure at @xmath40 ; for our choice @xmath56 and @xmath57 mev , @xmath58 in physical units ) .",
    "besides this first order transition with @xmath12 , we also consider a transition with a finite width @xmath13 to cover present uncertainties in the qcd eos .",
    "note , however , that a finite width would also naturally emerge in any finite system , even if the transition is of first order in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "the three different equations of state are displayed in fig .  1 .",
    "part ( a ) shows the entropy density divided by @xmath59 and ( b ) the energy density divided by @xmath60 as functions of temperature . for the equations of state with a transition , at @xmath61",
    "both quantities exhibit the strong increase ( or even a discontinuity ) observed in lattice calculations .",
    "part ( c ) shows the pressure and ( d ) the velocity of sound squared , @xmath62 , as functions of energy density . while for the ideal gas eos ( dashed lines )",
    "@xmath63 is constant for all energy densities , this is different for the eos with a first order phase transition , @xmath12 ( full lines ) , and the eos with a transition of finite width @xmath13 ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the pressure gradient @xmath64 vanishes for @xmath12 as long as matter is in the mixed phase , @xmath65 . for parts of the system , which pass through the corresponding region of energy densities , the tendency to expand",
    "is then considerably reduced compared to the ideal gas case , which results in a prolonged lifetime of the system @xcite . for the transition with finite width @xmath13 , the pressure gradients are finite , but nevertheless smaller than for the ideal gas .",
    "thus , again the system s lifetime will be prolonged @xcite .",
    "in a heavy - ion collision , the ideal fluid approximation breaks down in parts of the system which become so dilute that the collision rates between the particles are smaller than the ( local ) expansion rate of the system and thus local thermodynamic equilibrium can no longer be maintained .",
    "these parts of the system decouple ( `` freeze out '' ) from the hydrodynamic evolution and , eventually , the corresponding particles freely stream to the detectors . in a rigorous sense , on one hand they can no longer be described in the hydrodynamical framework ,",
    "while on the other , the energy and momentum carried away by these particles might influence the hydrodynamic evolution of the rest of the system .",
    "although attempts have been made @xcite , up to now no commonly accepted , consistent description of this so - called `` freeze - out '' process exists for the hydrodynamical description of heavy - ion collisions . the common way to treat",
    "this problem is to solve the hydrodynamical equations in the whole forward light cone and a posteriori identify those parts of the system as decoupled , which have cooled below a certain freeze - out temperature @xmath66 or whose density has dropped below a freeze - out density @xmath67 .",
    "final particle spectra are then calculated along the freeze - out hypersurface , @xmath68 , defined by the condition @xmath69 , or @xmath70 , respectively .    here",
    "we also follow this prescription and employ the approach of cooper and frye @xcite to calculate the particle spectra ( see e.g.  @xcite for a ( 1 + 1)dimensional application ) . in our case of vanishing ( net ) charges , the particle density is a function of temperature only , and thus freeze - out at constant density is equivalent to freeze - out at constant temperature .",
    "the freeze - out temperature is here taken as a free parameter in the range @xmath71 mev .    the single inclusive momentum distribution of `` frozen - out '' particles , i.e. , particles whose world lines cross the 3dimensional hypersurface @xmath72 in 4dimensional space ",
    "time is then given by @xcite @xmath73 in our case of pions or kaons , @xmath74 is the bose ",
    "einstein distribution function .",
    "@xmath75 is the normal vector on the ( local ) hypersurface element @xmath76 , and the integration runs over the complete freeze - out hypersurface @xmath72 .",
    "note that , while @xmath77 is per our definition of freeze - out constant along @xmath72 , the fluid velocity @xmath78 is not .",
    "the cooper ",
    "frye formula ( [ single ] ) is strictly valid only along space - like parts of the hypersurface @xmath72 , i.e. , where the normal vector @xmath79 is time - like . for time - like parts of @xmath72 ( space - like @xmath79 ) , however , @xmath80 can in principle become negative , corresponding to particles which re - enter the fluid and thus do not decouple from the system . from the physical point of view",
    ", this `` negative '' number of particles should not enter the single inclusive spectrum of frozen - out particles on the left - hand side of ( [ single ] ) .",
    "therefore , modifications of the cooper  frye formula have been proposed @xcite , which correct for this . they shall , however , not be employed here , because for the hydrodynamic solutions studied in the following we found the collective flow across the freeze - out surface to be rather strong . the maximum of the single  particle distribution function @xmath81 is therefore shifted in a way which renders the number of particles with given 4momentum @xmath82 that actually re - enter the fluid negligible .",
    "we shall quantify this statement below ( cf .",
    "discussion of figs .  7 , 8)",
    ".    the two  particle correlation function of two identical particles with momenta @xmath83 is defined as the ratio of the two  particle probability @xmath84 to the product of the single  particle probabilities for uncorrelated particles , @xmath85 we follow the method outlined in @xcite to compute ( [ defc2 ] ) . introducing the average 4momentum of the particle pair @xmath86 , and the relative 4momentum @xmath87 , and assuming that the particle source is chaotic and sufficiently large , the two  particle correlation function for bosons can be written as @xcite @xmath88 \\,\\ , f\\left ( k \\cdot u / t\\right)\\right|^2 } { e_1 \\ , [ { \\rm d}n/ { \\rm d}^3 { \\bf k}_1 ] \\,\\,\\ ,",
    "e_2\\ , [ { \\rm d}n/{\\rm d}^3 { \\bf k}_2 ] } \\,\\ , .\\ ] ] for the bjorken cylinder geometry , the number of independent variables can be reduced due to rotational symmetry around the beam axis . as in @xcite , we focus on the correlation functions of particles emitted at midrapidity @xmath89 .",
    "we choose the coordinate system such that @xmath90 , @xmath91 for the component of @xmath92 parallel to @xmath93 , and @xmath94 for the component of @xmath92 perpendicular to @xmath93 . with these assumptions , @xmath95 becomes a function of three independent variables only .",
    "the so - called out  and side  correlation functions are now defined as @xmath96 we then define the inverse width of the correlation functions in out and side  direction by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is determined by @xmath99 , and @xmath100 analogously .",
    "the inverse widths ( [ routside ] ) are a qualitative measure for the duration of particle emission and the transverse size of the source .",
    "their quantitative values , however , depend on the initial size of the system , @xmath101 , on the transverse momentum @xmath16 , as well as on the details of the hydrodynamic flow pattern at freeze - out @xcite . as argued in @xcite , these dependences should in principle largely cancel out if one considers the _ ratio _ of the inverse widths , @xmath4 .",
    "in @xcite it was also shown that , for the spherical expansion as well as for the bjorken cylinder expansion , this ratio is a good _ qualitative _ measure for the lifetime of the system .",
    "the explicit form of ( [ explc2 ] ) for the bjorken cylinder geometry was given in appendix b of @xcite and shall not be repeated here .",
    "for the side ",
    "correlation function , the single  particle spectra in the denominator of ( [ explc2 ] ) are equal ( because of rotational symmetry , the single  particle spectrum can only depend on the modulus of the transverse momentum , which is equal for the two particles , @xmath102 for pairs at midrapidity ) , while for the out  correlation function , they are approximately equal as long as the modulus of the relative momentum , @xmath103 , of the particle pair is small compared to @xmath16 ( note that @xmath104 for pairs at midrapidity ) . furthermore , in this case @xmath105 , and the correlation function can be approximated as @xcite @xmath106\\ , s(x , k)}{\\int { \\rm d}^4 x\\ , s(x , k ) } \\right|^2 \\equiv 1 + | \\langle \\exp[i q \\cdot x ] \\rangle |^2\\,\\,\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath107 is the so - called _ emission function _ of the source , and the right - hand side of ( [ apprc2 ] ) defines the average @xmath108 . in the following",
    "we shall make the boltzmann approximation for the single  particle distribution function , @xmath109 , which usually holds to good accuracy , especially for large average pair momenta @xmath16 .    in the case that the emission function is gaussian in space ",
    "time , the correlation function can be written in the form ( again , we focus on midrapidity pairs , @xmath110 ) @xcite @xmath111\\,\\ , , \\ ] ] where the ( @xmath16dependent ) so - called `` side '' and `` outwards radii '' @xmath112 of the correlation function are related to the variances of the emission function via @xcite @xmath113 here @xmath114 is the ( approximate ) transverse velocity of the particle pair and @xmath115 ( @xmath116 are defined analogously ) .",
    "note that , in the case of a gaussian source leading to the correlation function ( [ gaussc2 ] ) , the inverse widths defined in ( [ routside ] ) are related to the radii ( [ rout],[rside ] ) via @xmath117 . as will be seen in the next section",
    ", this formula holds to astonishingly good approximation in the cases considered here , even when the emission functions do not resemble gaussians .",
    "the eqs .",
    "( [ rout],[rside ] ) therefore allow for a reasonable qualitative and quantitative understanding of the shape of the source or the emission function , respectively .",
    "the explicit formulae for the variances required to calculate @xmath118 for the bjorken cylinder expansion are given in the appendix .",
    "we finally note that other parametrizations of the correlation function , such as the yano  koonin ",
    "podgoretskii approach @xcite , may be more advantageous than the standard ( pratt  bertsch ) parametrization from the point of view of obtaining a better _ quantitative _ estimate of the variances of the emission function @xcite . for studying the _",
    "qualitative _ behaviour of the proposed time ",
    "delay signature , however , the standard parametrization proves to be sufficient .",
    "for the bjorken cylinder expansion one has to specify an initial ( proper ) time @xmath11 for the expansion in order to avoid the divergence at @xmath119 in eqs .",
    "( [ eom2a],[eom2b ] ) .",
    "physically , this time corresponds to the thermalization time scale prior to which initial , non - equilibrium parton  parton scattering processes dominate the dynamical evolution . only for times",
    "@xmath120 , dynamics can be described by means of ( ideal ) hydrodynamics . according to the `` hot - glue '' scenario @xcite , @xmath121 fm for central au+au  collisions at rhic .",
    "since the transverse radius of the hot central zone in such collisions is of the order @xmath122 fm , we fix @xmath123 in the following .",
    "the dependence of the hydrodynamic flow pattern on varying @xmath11 as well as the initial energy density @xmath3 and the eos was discussed in detail in @xcite ( cf .",
    "figs .  7 - 9 therein ) and shall not be repeated here .    in particular , it was found in @xcite that , for fixed average pion pair momentum @xmath124 mev and for an initial energy density @xmath125 , in the case of the qcd transition the experimentally measurable ratio @xmath126 was considerably enhanced over the ideal gas case , reflecting the delay in the expansion of the system due to the softening of the eos in the transition region .",
    "this is once more shown in fig .  2 ( thin lines ) for the hydrodynamic expansion with a first order phase transition ( @xmath12 , @xmath56 , @xmath127 mev ) .",
    "the three curves correspond to different freeze - out temperatures @xmath128 ( full lines ) , @xmath129 ( dotted lines ) , and @xmath130 ( dashed lines ) . in this work",
    "we study this _ time ",
    "delay signature of the qcd transition _ not only as a function of @xmath3 , but also its dependence on @xmath16 , both for pions and kaons and for the three different equations of state discussed in subsection 2.2 .",
    "note that all correlation functions in this work are calculated taking the finite mass of the respective particles into account , but for the fluid evolution , hadron matter is considered to be an ultrarelativistic ideal gas . while this appears inconsistent from a rigorous point of view , quantitatively we do not expect a finite pion mass in the eos to severely affect the hydrodynamical evolution prior to decoupling , since the freeze - out temperatures considered here are around or even above @xmath131 .",
    "kaons in the hadronic phase are , on the other hand , suppressed by their larger mass , @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , the effect of these particles on the hydrodynamic evolution is expected to be small .",
    "this view is supported by the results of @xcite . moreover",
    ", small differences in the hydrodynamic evolution tend to have an even smaller impact on the correlation functions ( which represent in a certain sense averages over the dynamical evolution ) and thus on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    the thick lines in fig .",
    "2 represent our new results for kaons ( @xmath133 mev , @xmath134 mev ) . for these heavier mesons",
    "we also observe a local maximum in the excitation function , which again mirrors closely the prolongation of the lifetime of the system around @xmath135 .",
    "such a behaviour is _ not _ seen in the ideal gas case , where @xmath126 varies rather smoothly ( for the sake of clarity , we do not show results for the ideal gas in fig .  2 ; for that case see , for instance , figs .  3 , 5 below and fig",
    "17 ( a ) in ref .",
    "finally , note that for @xmath134 mev , the enhancement is nearly independent of the freeze - out temperature both for pions as well as for kaons .    for @xmath134 mev",
    "the absolute magnitude of @xmath126 is about a factor of 2 smaller for kaons than for pions .",
    "the reason is the higher mass of the kaons compared to pions which leads , for the comparatively small value of @xmath134 mev , to a considerable difference in the velocity of the kaon pair , @xmath136 , as compared to a pion pair with the same @xmath16 , @xmath137 . in figs .  7 , 8 below",
    "we shall explicitly show that the radii ( [ rout],[rside ] ) are reasonably good approximations for the actual inverse widths of the correlation functions .",
    "the most important term in ( [ rout ] ) turns out to be @xmath138 . since @xmath139 for the kaon pair , but @xmath140 for the pion pair , even if the time variances @xmath141 of the emission functions for kaon and pion pairs were roughly equal , the outward radius would turn out to be much smaller in the kaon case .",
    "in fact , the time variance for the kaon emission function is in general smaller than that of the pion source . in order to understand this ,",
    "note that the maximum of the emission function is typically located near points of the freeze - out hypersurface where the particle pair velocity @xmath142 matches the fluid velocity @xmath30 , since this minimizes the argument of the exponential term @xmath143 $ ] in the emission function . for a larger particle mass , however , the emission function decreases faster around this maximum , which in turn reduces its variance as compared to the case of a smaller mass particle .",
    "since this effect , however , also influences the spatial variance of the emission function , we expect it to ( roughly ) cancel out in the ratio @xmath126 .",
    "thus , the suppression of @xmath126 for kaons as observed in fig .",
    "2 is mainly due to the smaller kaon pair velocity .    on the other hand , following this argument we expect that for increasing values of @xmath16 , for which the pair velocity for kaons is closer to the causal limit ( and to that of pions ) , @xmath126 should approach similar values as for pions .",
    "this is indeed seen to be the case in fig .  3 where we plot @xmath126 for @xmath144 mev and @xmath12 .",
    "as in the pion case , there is a strong enhancement of about a factor of 2 over the corresponding ideal gas case ( thin lines ) for all three freeze - out temperatures . on the other hand ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath126 on the freeze - out temperature is larger than at @xmath124 mev ( cf . fig .  2 ) .",
    "delay signal is strongest for late freeze - out ( @xmath145 ) .    to study the influence of @xmath16 on the correlation signal in more detail , we present in fig .",
    "4 the ratio @xmath126 as a function of @xmath2 at fixed @xmath146 , i.e. , where the time  delay signal is maximized , and for the case of a first order transition in the eos . for pions ( thin lines ) as well as for kaons ( thick lines ) we observe a strong increase of the ratio with @xmath16 . while for pions , @xmath126 is of order 3 already at low momenta , the ratio for kaons increases only gradually from around 1 at @xmath147 mev , on account of the above discussed suppression due to the smaller kaon pair velocity .",
    "as expected , for high momenta , @xmath5 gev , @xmath126 for kaons approaches values comparable to those for pions , since both pion and kaon pair velocities approach unity .",
    "it is also seen from fig .",
    "4 that the observation made in @xcite that the time  delay signal does not depend strongly on the freeze - out temperature is not valid in general and was only due to the specific choice @xmath148 mev in that work .",
    "the sensitivity of the value of @xmath126 on the freeze - out temperature increases with @xmath16 , such that @xmath126 is the larger the smaller the freeze - out temperature is and may vary up to 20% for freeze - out between @xmath149 and @xmath150 .    in fig .",
    "5 we present the main result of the present work : shown are surface plots of @xmath126 in the @xmath151plane .",
    "the freeze - out temperature was fixed at @xmath149 .",
    "5 ( a ) shows the ratio of inverse widths for pions and @xmath12 ( solid lines ) versus the ideal gas case ( dotted lines ) . in part ( b )",

    "5 ( a , b ) , as for kaons , parts ( c , d ) . in accordance with fig .  4 and for the ( kinematic ) reasons discussed above , the ratio at low @xmath16 is smaller for kaons than for pions . also , the enhancement over the ideal gas case is less pronounced in the case of a smooth transition , @xmath13 , than for a first order phase transition , for reasons discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the most important property of fig .",
    "5 is to allow to identify the range of initial energy densities and transverse pair momenta required to maximize the time ",
    "delay signature . for our choice of @xmath152 fm",
    ", the signal is maximized for initial energy densities around @xmath153 . for smaller ( larger )",
    "@xmath11 , the respective values for @xmath3 increase ( decrease ) , as explained in @xcite .",
    "these values are well above the soft region of the eos , cf .  fig .  1 ( d ) .",
    "as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is due to the strong longitudinal motion in scaling hydrodynamics and opens the possibility to observe the time ",
    "delay effect at the rhic collider",
    ". moreover , fig .",
    "5 confirms that , for sufficiently high @xmath16 , the signal is as strong for kaons as for pions .",
    "kaon interferometry is , however , advantageous from the experimental point of view , since kaon yields in general are less contaminated by resonance decays , while neutral kaon correlations in particular are not subject to coulomb distortions from final state interactions .    in the following ,",
    "we want to elucidate the behaviour of @xmath126 in greater detail by studying the inverse widths separately as functions of @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "fig .  6 shows ( a , c ) @xmath0 and ( b , d ) @xmath1 both for ( a , b ) pions and ( c , d ) kaons for the case of a first order phase transition , @xmath12 .",
    "as one observes , for fixed @xmath16 , @xmath1 increases slowly with @xmath3 .",
    "this behaviour is naturally explained by the fact that higher initial energy densities drive the transverse expansion of the system more strongly ( cf .",
    "@xcite for the explicit hydrodynamic solutions ) , which increases the transverse size of the source . on the other hand , for fixed @xmath3",
    ", @xmath1 slowly decreases with increasing @xmath16 . to understand this quantitatively , recall that the emission function ( [ emiss ] ) has a maximum where @xmath154 is minimized . for larger pair momenta @xmath16 ( larger pair velocities @xmath142 ) the emission function @xmath155 $ ] will drop faster in the region around the maximum , which in turn makes the source appear smaller .    on the other hand , the @xmath3dependence of @xmath0 shows again clearly the time  delay signature of the qcd transition .",
    "an unexpected feature is , however , that @xmath0 _ increases _ with @xmath16 at fixed @xmath3 , at least for the case @xmath12 and for initial energy densities below about @xmath156 .",
    "according to the above argument , @xmath0 is expected to decrease as well , and the time  delay signature of fig .  5 solely due to the fact that the decrease of @xmath0 is _ slower _ than that of @xmath1 .    in order to understand why this is not the case for @xmath12 ,",
    "let us first consider a situation where this expectation is actually fulfilled .",
    "let us consider the hydrodynamic expansion in the case of a smooth transition @xmath13 and for an initial energy density @xmath157 ( cf .",
    "fig .  9 ( c ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in fig",
    ".  7 ( a ) we show the corresponding isotherms in the @xmath158plane ( this figure is identical with fig .  9 ( d ) of @xcite ) ,",
    "part ( b ) shows the flow velocity @xmath30 along the freeze - out hypersurface , i.e. , in our case the isotherm with @xmath159 in fig .",
    "since the mapping of the isotherm on time is unique we prefer to plot @xmath30 as function of @xmath160 rather than as function of @xmath32 , which , considering the shape of the isotherm , is obviously not unique .    in fig .  7 ( c ) we show the emission functions @xmath161 for pions , integrated over @xmath162 and @xmath163 ( i.e. , more precisely , the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) in the appendix ) , as a function of time along the freeze - out isotherm for three different values of the average transverse pair momentum , @xmath164 and @xmath165 mev .",
    "as one expects , for larger pair momenta / velocities the maximum of the emission function shifts to regions of higher transverse velocity on the hypersurface , i.e. , to earlier times .",
    "also , in confirmation of the above argument , the emission function becomes narrower , which reflects in a decreasing @xmath166 , as shown in fig .",
    "as expected , @xmath167 decreases with @xmath16 , too , although this can not be seen directly from the presentation of the emission function in fig .",
    ".    further understanding of this result can be gained by studying the radii ( [ rout],[rside ] ) . according to eq .",
    "( [ rout ] ) , @xmath168 consists of three different terms . the dashed line in fig .",
    "7 ( e ) shows the actual time variance @xmath169 of the emission function . in accordance with the above arguments , and in agreement with fig .  7 ( c )",
    ", this quantity decreases with @xmath16 . for the dotted line ,",
    "the time variance was multiplied by @xmath170 . for the light pions , @xmath170 is close to unity already for moderate @xmath171 mev and the difference between these two curves rapidly vanishes with increasing @xmath16 . for the long - dashed line",
    "the term @xmath172 was added .",
    "obviously , the @xmath173correlation of the emission function is negative and about 50% of the value of @xmath174 .",
    "the dash - dotted line is the full result for @xmath168 .",
    "as one notices , the variance in @xmath175direction is only a minor correction to the other two terms .",
    "it is astonishing how well the approximate relations ( [ rout],[rside ] ) reflect the qualitative _ and _ quantitative behaviour of the inverse widths of the correlation functions , although the shape of the emission function is not gaussian .",
    "( note that all variances appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ rout],[rside ] ) have been multiplied with a factor 1.44 , to account for the difference in the definition of inverse widths and radii , as discussed at the end of section 3 . )    in figs .  7 ( d , f )",
    "we show the corresponding results for kaons .",
    "one observes that the emission function in the case @xmath176 mev is now somewhat narrower in time direction than in the pionic case .",
    "the reason is the larger kaon mass , or equivalently , the smaller kaon pair velocity which suppresses emission of such pairs from regions of the hypersurface with high flow velocity , i.e. , at early times , cf .",
    "fig .  7 ( b ) .",
    "( remember that the emission function is large in regions where pair and flow velocity are equal . )",
    "this effect leads to considerably smaller values for @xmath0 and , as already discussed in the context of figs .  4 and 5 , @xmath126 .",
    "for larger @xmath16 , however , the size of the region in time from which kaon pairs are predominantly emitted does not decrease very much , as one confirms via the time variance ( dashed line in fig .  7 ( f ) ) .",
    "this at first sight astonishing result is due to the fact that the flow velocity remains large up to very late times , cf .",
    "fig .  7 ( b ) , such that kaon pairs with high velocity are not only emitted at early times ( where the flow velocity is high anyway ) , but also up to late times before the origin cools below @xmath159 .",
    "the strong increase in the kaon pair velocity with @xmath16 leads then to a corresponding _ increase _ in @xmath0 and @xmath177 , cf .",
    "fig.7 ( f).note that due to the larger kaon mass , the difference between dashed and dotted curves is much bigger than for the pion case .    in fig .",
    "8 we present the corresponding results for the case @xmath12 which serves to explain the behaviour observed in fig .  6 . in this case , the outward radii increase with @xmath16 _ both _ for kaons _ and _ pions .",
    "the reason is that the emission functions , besides the shift of the maximum to earlier times , do not exhibit a decrease of the emission probability at late times , resulting in an overall _ increase _ in the duration of particle emission and , correspondingly , in the outward radii . from the above it",
    "is clear that due to the larger kaon mass , the increase of the outward radius with @xmath16 is much stronger for kaons than for pions .",
    "the reason for the increase in the width of the emission function is the behaviour of the flow velocity , fig .",
    "even up to times where the freeze - out reaches the origin , @xmath30 stays comparatively large , enhancing the emission probability for particle pairs with high velocity .",
    "the physical reason for this high transverse velocity is a rarefaction shock wave ( cf .",
    "fig .  9 ( a ) in @xcite ) , which travels inwards and expells matter with a constant flow velocity , a fact that is confirmed by the plateau observed in fig .",
    "8 ( b ) for times between @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "note again the excellent agreement between approximate radii , @xmath118 , and the inverse widths of the correlation functions , @xmath180 , in figs .  8 ( e , f ) , although the emission functions are not even remotely resembling gaussian distributions .",
    "in fact , for ( [ rout],[rside ] ) to be good approximations of the inverse widths it is sufficient that the _ correlation functions _ resemble gaussians , rather than the emission functions themselves . in",
    "most ( realistic ) situations , this happens to be the case .",
    "we finally mention that the high flow velocity in the cases of interest ensures that the negative contributions to the spectra and the correlation functions are negligible , as indicated in subsection 2.3 .",
    "quantitatively , they are smaller than 1% ( of the total particle number crossing the freeze - out hypersurface ) for the smallest transverse momenta considered , @xmath181 mev . for larger transverse momenta , they are even smaller .",
    "in this work we have investigated the time  delay effect of the qcd transition on two  pion and two  kaon correlations in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions in the framework of ideal hydrodynamics with transverse cylindrical and boost - invariant longitudinal symmetry .",
    "our study is an extension of the work in @xcite , where this time  delay signal , i.e. , an enhanced ratio @xmath126 , was investigated for pion interferometry with fixed average transverse pair momentum @xmath148 mev .",
    "our main interest in the present work was the transverse momentum dependence of the proposed signal , and the question whether it can be also seen in two  kaon interferometry .",
    "kaon interferometry seems preferable for two reasons .",
    "first , effects of resonance decays are small ( only the shorter - lived @xmath182 resonances influence the final kaon spectra , at most a ( small ) 10%effect at temperatures corresponding to freeze - out @xcite ) . for pion interferometry , however , the decay of long - lived resonances plays an important role and virtually increases the ( average ) source size and lifetime of the system @xcite .",
    "this results in considerable modifications of the inverse width of the two  particle correlation functions of pions @xcite .",
    "second , neutral kaon correlation functions would not be influenced by final state coulomb interactions at small relative momenta ( where the correlation signal is large ) .",
    "we presented a systematic study of the inverse widths @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and their ratio for two  pion and two  kaon correlation functions at midrapidity , as a function of the initial energy density @xmath3 , the average transverse momentum of the particle pair @xmath16 , and for different equations of state .",
    "studying the emission functions and their variances for selected cases , we explained in detail the momentum dependence of the inverse width in out  direction .",
    "we confirmed that the prolongation of the lifetime of the system due to the qcd transition is observable in an enhanced ratio @xmath126 for kaons as well as for pions .",
    "the proposed signal is maximized for initial energy densities expected to be reached in central au+au  collisions at the rhic collider , @xmath17 ( for realistic @xcite values of the initial thermalization time scale , @xmath183 fm ) , and for pairs with high average transverse momentum , @xmath184 gev .",
