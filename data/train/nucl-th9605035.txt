    "ever since nuclear effects in deep inelastic lepton scattering on hadron targets have clearly manifested itself over the last decade , both particle and nuclear theorists obtained a profound insight into physics of the emc effect . however a majority of models of the emc effect provided by a fully relativistic hadronic theory resorts to the relativistic impulse approximation ( ria ) with the off - mass - shell kinematics , for example see refs .",

    "it seems to be evident that the free nucleon structure function ( sf ) @xmath1 is somehow affected by the nuclear medium . here",

    "@xcite , assume that properties of nuclear constituents , nucleons and mesons , are insensitive to the nuclear environment .",
    "yet the hadronic current , which is poorly understood object so far , may depend on dynamics of nucleons inside a nucleus and their interactions .",
    "the common assumption in this case is to treat the hadronic current as the sum of currents of single ( quasi)free nucleons , whereas the relation between the momentum and energy of the virtual nucleon is specified in a relevant treatment of the relativistic bound state .",
    "such a proviso substantiates derivations of the convolution formula for the nuclear sf with a consideration of relativistic kinematics .",

    "@xcite to investigate deep inelastic scattering on light nuclei .",
    "the method relays on the leading order operator product expansion ( ope ) within the effective meson - nucleon theory .",
    "it allows one to derive the convolution formula for the nuclear sf which accounts for the role of the fermi motion and binding effects in a new and unambiguous form .",
    "such a formulation yields the @xmath6th moment of the nuclear sf as a product of the moments of the isolated - hadron sf s and the moments of the effective hadron momentum distributions .",
    "the latter are given by matrix elements of twist - two operators sandwiched between the ground state vector of the target .",
    "using the hamiltonian formalism relevant operators in the ope are found in the lowest order approximation on the meson - nucleon coupling constant and resulting operators involve the meson degrees of freedom .",
    "finally the matrix elements of these operators are calculated over the ground state of the target in the non - relativistic ( nr ) limit .",
    "the coefficient functions together with meson cloud contributions are substituted by the moments of the isolated - hadron sf .    in this paper",
    "we apply the method proposed in refs .",

    "we assume that the off - shell effect on quark and anti - quark momentum distributions in hadrons may be neglected . in this way",
    "the mellin transform reconstructs the deuteron sf as a sum of convolution terms describing the fermi motion and the binding in the deuteron due to meson exchanges .",
    "since meson exchange currents ( mec ) are associated with exchange mechanisms responsible for the binding in the deuteron , momentum distribution for the constituent mesons reveal itself as well .",
    "advantage of this relativistic approach is that it differentiates the pure binding effects from the off - shell effects as both have an unlike origin .",
    "the magnitude of the former is given in terms of well - understood quantities such as the kinetic energy of a nucleon and the binding energy of the deuteron .",

    "the open questions the model suggests are that an additional work to be done in order to establish connection between the off - shell and on - shell sf @xmath193 in this framework ; next to what extent the negative - energy states in the bs vertex function impact on the momentum distributions of the nucleons ; and finally the exact functional shape of the momentum distribution of the excess pions associated with the one pion exchange in the deuteron is not of the least interest .    to sum up",
