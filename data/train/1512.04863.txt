    "single balance laws in one space dimension mostly present smooth fluxes , although the case of piecewise smooth fluxes is of interest both for the mathematics and for applications .",
    "source terms instead are naturally rough , and singularities of different nature have a physical and geometrical meaning . as well , they might indeed make a difference among the eulerian and lagrangian description of the phenomenon which is being modeled , for the mathematics .",
    "we are concerned in this paper with different notions of _ continuous _ solutions of the pde @xmath3 for a bounded source term @xmath4 .",
    "an essential feature of conservation laws is that solutions to the cauchy problem do develop shocks in finite time .",
    "nevertheless , the source might act as a control device for preventing this shock formation : exploiting the geometric interplay and correspondence with intrinsic lipschitz surfaces in the heisenberg group , @xcite show , for the quadratic flux , that the cauchy problem admits continuous solutions for any hlder continuous initial datum , if one chooses accordingly a bounded source term .",
    "this framework of continuous solutions , with more regularity assumptions on the source term , was already considered in  @xcite as the natural class of solutions to certain interesting dispersive partial differential equations that can be recast as balance laws .",
    "we believe that our study is relevant also in order to point out that , even in the analysis of a single equation in one space dimension , the mathematical difficulties do not only arise by the presence of shocks : also the study of continuous solutions has important delicate points which are not technicalities .",
    "this fails the expectation that the study of continuous solutions should be easy , and equation   is a toy - model for more complex situations .",
    "one can adopt the eulerian viewpoint or the lagrangian / broad viewpoint : roughly , the first interprets the equation in a distributional sense while the second consists in an infinite dimensional system of odes along characteristics .",
    "we compare here the equivalence among the formulations when @xmath5 is assumed to be continuous , but no more .",
    "we remark that even with the quadratic flux @xmath6 in general @xmath5 is not more than hlder continuous , see  @xcite , so that a finer analysis is needed .",
    "continuous solutions are regularized to locally lipschitz on the open set @xmath7 , exploiting the results of this paper , for time - dependent solutions when the source term @xmath8 is autonomous  @xcite , but not in general .",
    "examples of stationary solutions which are neither absolutely continuous nor of bounded variation are trivially given by continuous functions @xmath9 for which @xmath10 has bounded derivative .",
    "correspondences among different formulations are already done at different levels in  @xcite for the special , but relevant , case of the quadratic flux .",
    "we extend the analysis with new tools .",
    "the issue is delicate because @xmath4 in this setting lacks even of continuity in the @xmath11 variable , and characteristic curves need not be unique because @xmath5 lacks of smoothness . as a consequence ,",
    "the source terms for the two descriptions lie in different spaces :    * in the eulerian point of view @xmath8 is identified only as a distribution in the @xmath12-space . * in the lagrangian / broad viewpoint it is the restriction of @xmath8 on any characteristic curve which must identify uniquely a distribution in the @xmath13-space  or for a weaker notion only on a chosen family of characteristics that we call lagrangian parameterization .",
    "the aim of this paper is to consider and to discuss when eulerian , broad and lagrangian solution of   that we just mentioned are equivalent notions , without addressing what is the correspondence among the suitable source terms  if any .",
    "the correspondence of the source terms , source terms which belong to different functional spaces , is the subject of the companion paper  @xcite , including counterexamples which show that the formulations are not always equivalent .",
    "we conclude mentioning that broad solutions were introduced in  @xcite as generalizations of classical solutions alternative to the distributional ( eulerian ) ones , and presented e.g.  also in  @xcite .",
    "they were successfully studied and applied in different situations where characteristic curves are unique ; the analysis in situations when characteristics do merge and split however was only associated to the presence of shocks , and a different analysis related to multivalued solutions was performed .",
    "they were then considered for the quadratic flux by f.  bigolin and f.  serra cassano for their interest related to intrinsic regular and intrinsic lipschitz surfaces in the heisenberg group .",
    "our notions of lagrangian and broad solutions collapse and substantially coincide with the ones in the literature when the settings overlap .",
    "they are otherwise a nontrivial extension of those concepts , and most of the issues in the analysis arise because of our different setting .",
    "as we are in a non - standard setting , we explain extensively the different notions of solutions and we specify the notation we adopt .",
