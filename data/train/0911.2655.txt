    "<S> we re - visit the production of cosmic rays by cusps on cosmic strings . </S>",
    "<S> if a scalar field ( `` higgs '' ) has a linear interaction with the string world - sheet , such as would occur if there is a bosonic condensate on the string , cusps on string loops emit narrow beams of very high energy higgses which then decay to give a flux of ultra high energy cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> the ultra - high energy flux and the gamma to proton ratio agree with observations if the string scale is @xmath0 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the diffuse gamma ray and proton fluxes are well below current bounds . </S>",
    "<S> strings that are _ lighter _ and have linear interactions with scalars produce an excess of direct and diffuse cosmic rays and are ruled out by observations , while heavier strings ( @xmath1 gev ) are constrained by their gravitational signatures . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves a narrow window of parameter space for the existence of cosmic strings with bosonic condensates .    </S>",
    "<S> the detection of cosmic topological defects can provide a direct window to fundamental physics and the very early universe ( for a review , see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence it is no surprise that there has been a concerted effort to examine observational consequences of cosmic topological defects , including gravitational wave emission , gravitational lensing , fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background , and ultra - high energy cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> if cosmic strings are superconducting , they may also lead to electromagnetic phenomena such as gamma ray and radio bursts .    </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational effects of cosmic strings are stronger for heavier strings and current observations of the cosmic microwave background rule out strings above the @xmath2 gev energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> as lighter strings are considered , gravitational effects become less significant , and other particle physics signatures become relatively important . if the strings are superconducting , the currents on the string can lead to electromagnetic radiation that could be observable . however , </S>",
    "<S> if the strings are not superconducting , such signatures will be absent , and one must turn to particle emission from cosmic strings . if string dynamics forces loop production at the smallest possible scales , as suggested in @xcite , particles can be copiously emitted , leading to strong constraints . </S>",
    "<S> however , other studies indicate that string loops are large compared to microscopic length scales @xcite and particle emission is suppressed @xcite . even in this case , </S>",
    "<S> portions of a string loop may get boosted to very high lorentz factors , creating a `` cusp '' on the string ( see fig .  [ schematics ] ) , and this may potentially provide a burst of particles that could be seen in cosmic ray detectors .    particle emission from cusps on cosmic strings has been studied by several authors . </S>",
    "<S> srednicki and theisen @xcite considered a quadratic interaction of a scalar field with an idealized ( zero thickness ) string and came to the conclusion that particle emission is insignificant for astrophysical size string loops . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis for the radiation is similar to that of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , though the particular _ linear _ interaction of the scalar field ( call it @xmath3 ) with the string world - sheet , as would occur if @xmath3 condenses on the string , has not been considered before . </S>",
    "<S> a linear interaction causes an enhancement of particle production by a factor of @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the string scale and @xmath6 is the mass of @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> . if @xmath5 is the grand unification scale , while @xmath6 is the electroweak scale , this factor can be as large as @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> particle emission from cusps on _ thick _ strings has been considered in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> now the cusp consists of overlapping , oppositely oriented strings that can annihilate and give off energetic particles . </S>",
    "<S> a careful study of this process , including numerical evolution of the field equations , shows that the resulting flux of particles is too small to be of interest @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the linear interaction mechanism we study is insensitive to the thickness of the string , and occurs over a string length that is much larger than the length over which cusp annihilation occurs </S>",
    "<S> . thus we can ignore cusp annihilation and work in the zero thickness limit .    </S>",
    "<S> there are important observational constraints on the so - called `` top down '' models for production of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) , in which a heavy particle decays to give ultra - high energy protons and gamma rays . </S>",
    "<S> the constraint arises because there are bounds on the diffuse gamma ray flux in the egret window and also on the fraction of photons to protons in the observed uhecr . in previous studies , using cusp annihilation on cosmic strings as the source of higgs injection , it was found that the egret constraint on diffuse gamma ray fluxes implies that the flux of uhecr is uninterestingly low . however , the constraint on diffuse gamma rays is sensitive to the spectral features of the injected higgs particles and to the particular interaction of the string . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs particle emission that we consider yields a diffuse flux of gamma rays and protons that is below egret bounds if the string scale is @xmath8 gev and an uhecr flux consistent with observations for string scale @xmath0 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of photons to protons in the uhecr flux is also consistent with current bounds . </S>",
    "<S> hence our model can explain the observed uhecr and not run into trouble with the egret bounds .    </S>",
    "<S> it is to be noted that cosmic ray production by strings increases as the string scale _ decreases_. hence strings on scales less than @xmath0 gev , and with these interactions , are _ excluded _ by the observed flux of uhecr . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially interesting since heavier strings are constrained by their gravitational signatures . </S>",
    "<S> hence there is a narrow window between , say , @xmath9 gev for the mass scale of cosmic strings having linear interactions with a scalar field .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , the novelty in the present work is that we are considering a new , generic , interaction of cosmic strings with scalar fields that leads to high energy particle emission . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction seems to have been missed in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> also , we have been careful to take the beamed nature of the emission into account . </S>",
    "<S> we have focused on deriving approximate analytical estimates so as to keep the physical aspects of the problem as apparent as possible . </S>",
    "<S> more detailed predictions will require numerical evaluation of the production and propagation .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fieldtheory ] by describing the field theory interactions under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> we then evaluate the rate at which a single cusp emits higgs particles in sec .  </S>",

    "<S> these cosmic rays originate in strings that are relatively far away from the earth . </S>",
