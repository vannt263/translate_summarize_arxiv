    "the oh / ir source irc+10420 = iras19244 + 1115 identified with the peculiar high luminosity star v1302aql is a unique object , which has been carefully and comprehensively studied over the last decades but still remains a puzzle .",
    "of the two hypotheses about its nature neither seems to be convincingly preponderant as yet . according to fix and cobb ( 1987 ) , hrivnak et al . , ( 1989 ) and others this is a degenerate core giant evolving through the proto - planetary nebula stage with a luminosity no higher than @xmath3 . according to jones et al . , ( 1993 ) , humphreys and davidson ( 1994 ) and oudmaijer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) this is a core - burning hypergiant of @xmath4 .",
    "the difficulty of choice is due to :    * the uncertainty of fundamental observational parameters , such as spectral class and distance ; * the fact that with the difference in mass , age , even type of stellar population the evolutionary processes and their observational evidence are similar : in both alternatives the effective temperature of the star increases , there is a gaseous - dust envelope inherited from the red giant or supergiant phase , which interacts with the stellar wind ; * the presence of several competing models : thin chromosphere in the expanding gaseous - dust envelope such optically thick that we see the light of the star being multiple scaterring by circumstellar dust ( fix and cobb , 1987 ) ; a gaseous - dust disk in a clumpy envelope ( jones et al . ,",
    "1993 ) ; jets with a small angle of opening ( oudmaijer et al . , 1994 ) ; and at last infall of circumstellar material onto photosphere ( oudmaijer , 1995 ) .",
    "outer regions of the source of radius 2 - 3 arcsec are mainly described and mapped by radio astronomy techniques from emission of molecules ( paper by nedoluha and bowers ( 1992 ) and references therein ) .",
    "the gas envelope has been imaged by the methods of infrared speckle interferometry and coronagraphy ( ridgway et al .",
    ", 1986oc ; kastner and weintraub , 1995 ) .",
    "the image of the dust envelope also extends to several seconds of arc , but the radiation is sharply enhanced in the region of about 0.1arcsec in radius . however space or ground - based speckle images in the optical range , which could refine the structure of the central region , unknown to us .    here",
    "the high resolution optical spectrum of irc+10420 , which contains the emission and absorption lines of the envelope and absorption ones of the photosphere or of the pseudophotosphere of the central star , is described .",
    ".observation log of irc+10420 [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "so , the optical spectrum of irc+10420 of the years from 1992 through 1996    * points to the increase in the temperature : spectral class a5 instead of f8 in 1973 ; * contains absorptions ( mainly of ions ) formed in the photosphere , apparently stationary with respect to the star center of mass ; * contains emission details too , which are formed in the expanding envelope and perhaps in its compressing layers ; * rezembles the spectra of late - type b[e ] stars ;    the metallicity , which is close to solar , and the altered [ n / c]-value allow us to consider irc+10420 as a massive object at the evolution stage of at least after the first dredge - up and not to reject the hypothesis of jones et al .",
    "( 1993 ) who suggested that irc+10420 is a true hypergiant with a mass of about @xmath5 , evolving from the red supergiant phase to the wolf - rayet stage .",
    "the nature of irc+10420 is still open question .",
    "new observations are necessary to obtain full chemical abundance pattern and to coordinate luminosity , distance and radial velocity of this object . besides that we need more careful indentification of extremely plentiful and variable features of the optical spectra of irc+10420 .",
    "for example , what are the enigmatic narrow strong absorption details @xmath6 ? for the present one can say only that these are not telluric lines .    it should be noted that in the frames of the study of supergiants with infrared excess ( klochkova , 1995 ; zas et al . , 1995 ) we have obtained also the spectra of the supergiant hd179821 = iras19114 + 0002 , which has been considered analogous to irc+10420 ( kastner , weintraub , 1995 ) . based on these spectra results",
    "have recently been obtained ( zas et al . , 1996 ) for hd179821 , using the model atmosphere method : @xmath7 , logg=1.3 , iron peak elements are slightly underabundant , sc and ti are slightly overabundant . but for this object zas et al .",
    "( 1996 ) revealed the overabundance of sodium , s - process ( y , zr ) and r - process ( eu ) elements .",
    "the overabundance of s - process points to the post - agb stage of evolution of hd179821 .",
    "however for more general conclusions about the nature of hd179821 and its likeness to irc+10420 , abundances of cno - triad are needed .    _",
