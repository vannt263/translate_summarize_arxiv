    "in recent times , the notions of persistence and the associated persistence exponent has become one of the active topics of research in non - equilibrium physics@xcite . in general , the persistence probability @xmath2 is the probability that a stochastic variable @xmath23 remains above or below a certain arbitrary value ( say , its initial value ) for a time interval @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "the idea of persistence is particularly relevant in coarsening systems where @xmath2 has the natural interpretation of being the fraction of space in the system which remains in the same phase , starting from a random initial configuration . in these systems ( as in some other systems also ) @xmath2 typically decays as a power - law at large @xmath13 , with an exponent that is non - trivial to compute and does not appear to be simply related to other known exponents that characterize the process .",
    "the coarsening dynamics of the one dimensional @xmath1-state potts model at zero temperature is one of the few cases where the persistence exponent @xmath4 is known exactly .",
    "the solution was provided by derrida _ et.al _ through a mapping of the process to a coagulation model in steady state@xcite .",
    "it was shown that at late times @xmath13 , well beyond the time scale of equilibration , the fraction of persistent spins left in a finite system of linear dimension @xmath25 scale as @xmath26 , where @xmath4 is given by the non - trivial expression    @xmath27^{2}. \\label{eq : eq1}\\ ] ]    for times @xmath28 , it follows that @xmath29 .",
    "an interesting question in this context is about the spatial distribution of spins which are persistent up to any given time @xmath13 .",
    "clearly , in a many - body process like the time evolution of potts model , the probability that a given spin is persistent is closely linked to the state of other spins .",
    "this inter - dependence of spins is crucial in that it makes the time evolution at any single site strongly non - markovian , which makes the computation of the persistence exponent highly non - trivial .",
    "a study of the spatial aspects of the persistence problem is therefore important from the point of view developing an intuitive understanding of the phenomenon , and also illuminates the interplay between persistence decay and the underlying domain coarsening process .    the spatial distribution of persistent sites and its time evolution",
    "have been studied previously through numerical simulations in one dimensional diffusion equation@xcite , @xmath1-state potts model@xcite , two dimensional ising model@xcite and one dimensional ising model with parallel dynamics@xcite .",
    "an analytic study using a rate equation approach under the independent interval approximation(iia ) has been carried out for one dimensional @xmath30 model which is closely related to 1d ising model@xcite .",
    "it is now generally understood from physical arguments and simulations that for a coarsening process in @xmath31 dimensions where characteristic length scale has the power - law growth @xmath32 , the set of persistent sites forms a fractal structure with fractal dimension @xmath33 over length scales @xmath34@xcite .",
    "the distribution is homogeneous beyond this length scale .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath35 , the distribution is expected to be homogeneous over all length scales if @xmath36 .",
    "this has important consequences for systems like the potts model where @xmath37 changes with the potts state @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , for potts model in @xmath38 , bray and odonoghue@xcite argued that a transition from fractal to homogeneous distribution occurs as @xmath37 crosses @xmath39 .",
    "this transition is also marked by an abrupt change in the dynamical exponent characterizing the separation between persistent sites .",
    "the characteristic length scale was conjectured to have the unusual dynamical scaling form @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "this conjecture based on physical arguments was supported by numerical simulations@xcite .    in this paper , we use a mean - field approach to address the problem of spatial distribution of persistent sites in @xmath1-state potts model . the essential idea behind this approach is as follows .",
    "it is well - known that the @xmath0 coarsening dynamics of the @xmath1-state potts model can be mapped to a reaction - diffusion process . in this process",
    ", the interfaces between different species of potts spins are represented by diffusing particles @xmath42 , which annihilate or coagulate upon meeting with @xmath1-dependent probabilities . in the mean field approach , these diffusing particles are treated as homogeneously distributed , with ( time - dependent ) density equal to the average density in the original reaction - diffusion problem . this approach has been discussed in some earlier works as a heuristic argument @xcite and as a toy model for persistence @xcite .",
    "we argue that this approach yields a lower bound for the persistence exponent in the potts model .",
    "we then construct an artificial model which is devoid of spatial correlations among diffusing particles , but with persistence exponent tuned to be exactly equal to the potts model value .",
    "we refer to this model as the modified mean - field approximation ( mmfa ) and use this approximation to study the spatial distribution of persistent sites in @xmath1-state potts model .",
    "we outline our main results at this point . within the mmfa",
    ", we show analytically that the correlation length for the spatial distribution of persistent spins scales as @xmath43 and the equal time pair correlation function @xmath44 ( defined as the probability that the spin at origin and the point @xmath45 are persistent at time @xmath13 ) has the scaling form @xmath46 for any value of @xmath37 .",
    "this shows that the persistent spins have a fractal distribution with @xmath47 over length scales @xmath48 when @xmath49 , but @xmath50 when @xmath51 .",
    "we find that the characteristic length scale of the spatial distribution of persistent spins has the unusual scaling form @xmath40 where @xmath15=max(@xmath16 ) , in agreement with the conjecture in @xcite .",

    "we support these results with numerical simulations .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we outline the mean field approach . in section iii",
    ", we introduce the mmfa and compute the pair correlation and empty interval distribution of persistent sites to characterize their spatial distribution .",
    "these predictions are compared with the results of numerical simulations in the @xmath1-state potts model in sec .",
    "we summarize our results and present our conclusions in sec . v.",
    "in the zero temperature coarsening dynamics of @xmath1-state potts model in @xmath38 , the interfacial points between different species of potts spins perform independent random walks on the lattice and annihilate each other with probability @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) , or coagulate with probability @xmath59 . in the process , persistent sites are ` wiped out ' , and the surviving random walkers build up spatial correlations among themselves .",
    "the distribution of intervals between the surviving random walkers at any ( sufficiently late ) time @xmath13 is described by a ( stationary ) scaling function which is known exactly for all values of @xmath1@xcite .",
    "the average density @xmath60 at time @xmath13 decays as    @xmath61    asymptotically@xcite . the essential idea behind the mean field ( mf )",
    "approximation is to treat the random walkers as forming a homogeneous background of average density @xmath60 , as far as the persistent sites are concerned .",
    "we define the persistence probability @xmath2 as the probability that the site at the origin is unvisited by any walker till time @xmath13 .",
    "then , the probability that the site the probability that the site is visited by a walker between time @xmath13 and @xmath62 is @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath64 be the probability that the site at origin is visited by a walker for the first time at time @xmath13 , whose initial position was @xmath22 at @xmath65 . within the mf approximation ,",
    "any walker would survive with probability @xmath60 , and the probability that it will make a first visit to origin at time @xmath13 is given by @xmath66@xcite .",
    "it follows that @xmath67 .",
    "we now integrate @xmath64 over all initial positions @xmath22 and multiply by the probability that the origin is persistent at time @xmath13 , which is simply @xmath2 .",
    "so we find    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the smoluchowski constant@xcite in @xmath38 . after substituting for @xmath70 and @xmath60 , we find @xmath71 , so that @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is the persistence exponent within the mf model@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare the mean field prediction for @xmath37 with the exact value of the exponent . for @xmath74 , @xmath75 , while the exact value from eq.[eq : eq1 ] is @xmath76 . for the @xmath77 case , the mf model predicts @xmath78 , which is to be compared with the exact value @xmath79 . upon extending the comparison to the entire range of values of @xmath1 ,",
    "it is clear that the mean field treatment consistently under - estimates the value of @xmath37 .",
    "we now argue that @xmath80 is , in fact , a lower bound for @xmath4 . in the mean field approach discussed so far , it is assumed that the random walkers disappear from the lattice at random at such a rate so that their average density falls as @xmath60 .",
    "the actual reaction - diffusion process is quite different , because only walkers which come very close to another walker are likely to be removed . clearly in regions of space",
    "where walkers come close to each other , they are likely to visit the same site again and again .",
    "this effect is much more within the mean field approach , where the walkers actually pass through each other , possibly several times before disappearing .",
    "thus , it is plausible that for the same average density of walkers , a larger number of persistent sites will be visited in the actual reaction - diffusion model , compared to its mean field analogue .",
    "since this is true for all times , the average density of persistent sites in mean field theory will be higher than the same in the actual potts model dynamics .",
    "this would naturally imply that    @xmath81    interestingly , we show now that the mean field argument presented above yields the correct value for the persistence exponent for @xmath30 model in @xmath82 .",
    "this is not surprising , since for this model , the upper critical dimension is @xmath83 , and the mean field treatment becomes exact above this dimension .",
    "it can be shown that in @xmath82 , the probability that a random walker starting at an an arbitrary point crosses a circle of radius @xmath84 around the origin for the first time at @xmath13 is given by the expression@xcite    @xmath85    which is the analogue of smoluchowski constant in @xmath82 .",
    "the asymptotic particle density decay for @xmath30 model in @xmath82 has the form @xmath86@xcite . upon extending the mf arguments presented previously",
    ", we find that    @xmath87    after substituting for @xmath60 and @xmath88 , and taking the limit @xmath89 , we find that @xmath90 so that @xmath91 in @xmath82 .",
    "this result is exact , as has been shown by a rigorous field - theoretic calculation@xcite .",
    "we thus observe that while the mean field approach , in general , gives only a lower bound for the persistence exponent , it correctly identifies the essential features that brings about this power - law decay , ie .",
    ", the diffusive motion of interfacial points and the @xmath92 decay in their over - all density . in the following sections , we use a slightly modified version of this treatment to study the spatial distribution of persistent sites in @xmath1-state potts model",
    "our purpose is to use the mean field approach to study the spatial distribution of persistent spins in the @xmath1-state potts model , and in particular , to understand the transition from fractal to homogeneous distribution as @xmath37 crosses @xmath39 .",
    "however , it may be noted that in the mean field approximation to the dynamics of the potts model , the largest value of @xmath37 ( attained at @xmath77 ) is @xmath93 which is less than the transition value @xmath39 .",
    "this problem is circumvented by defining an artificial model where we define the diffusing particles as non - interacting random walkers , who can pass through each other .",
    "the model also allows for multiple occupancy of lattice sites .",
    "the dynamics consists of random walkers being picked at random and taken out of the lattice at a time - dependent rate , which is tuned to produce power - law decay @xmath94 with any arbitrary @xmath95 . from the arguments presented in the previous section ,",
    "it is obvious that this would be the case if the average density were to decay as @xmath96 asymptotically . by construction , this model is devoid of spatial correlations among reacting particles ( ie .",
    ", it is still mean field ) but @xmath95 is now arbitrary . if we now choose @xmath97 , this model is an approximation to the @xmath1-state potts model , with the simplifying feature that the spatial correlation between interfacial points is now absent .",
    "we shall refer to this model as the modified mean field approximation ( mmfa ) for the original potts model .      in this section",
    ", we compute the equal time pair correlation function for persistent spins in @xmath1-state potts model under the mmfa .",
    "we define @xmath5 as the probability that both the site at origin and the site at @xmath98 are persistent at time @xmath13 .",
    "our purpose is to compute @xmath5 for various @xmath99 .",
    "the generalization of eq.[eq : eq3 ] to this case is    @xmath100    where @xmath101 is the probability that a particle with initial position @xmath102 will make a first visit to the origin at time @xmath13 , _ without ever crossing @xmath99 in the interval [ 0:t]_. the factor 2 in front takes into account the probability that either of the sites could be reached by one of the diffusing particles . unlike the first case , @xmath101 is now different for @xmath103 and @xmath104 . for @xmath103 ,",
    "the constraint of no crossing at @xmath99 is irrelevant for the computation of @xmath101 , since to reach @xmath99 , the particle would have to cross the origin first .",
    "so @xmath105 simply for @xmath103 , and so    @xmath106    for @xmath107 , this is no longer true , and @xmath101 needs to be computed separately .",
    "the quantity that we need here is @xmath108 , the probability that a diffusing particle whose position at @xmath65 is @xmath22 , will reach the origin for the first time at @xmath13 , without ever crossing the point @xmath99 in between . then @xmath109 . to find @xmath108 ,",
    "let us use the following standard method .",
    "consider a random walk starting from @xmath110 at @xmath65 with absorbing barriers at @xmath111 and @xmath99 .",
    "if the probability distribution of the position @xmath112 of the walker at time @xmath13 is @xmath113 , then    @xmath114    the expression for @xmath113 is known exactly , and the asymptotic form at large @xmath13@xcite is    @xmath115    from which , we find    @xmath116    we note that for @xmath117 , the @xmath118 mode is the dominant term in the sum , and this gives @xmath119 + smaller terms that vanish as @xmath120 . clearly in this limit , we recover the @xmath121 term , as we should .",
    "it then follows that    @xmath122    where    @xmath123    with @xmath124 .",

    "it is further clear that , from the definition of the scaling function as given by the expression eq.[eq : eq14 ] , this constant is unity , since we expect @xmath135 as @xmath136 . for convenience of later calculations",

    "this is characteristic of a fractal distribution under some circumstances . to see this ,",
    "let us first define @xmath139 , which is the probability of finding a persistent spin at a distance @xmath99 from another persistent spin .",
    "now , the integral @xmath140 is the total number of persistent spins within a radius @xmath141 of a persistent spin .",

    "thus , if we look at length scales @xmath143 , there is a fractal structure when @xmath49 .",

    "this quantity is the empty interval distribution , which is one of the standard tools in the study of one - dimensional reaction - diffusion processes .",
    "an empty interval , in our convention , is the separation between two consecutive persistent sites .",
