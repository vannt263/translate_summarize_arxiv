    "finally , it is possible that the x - rays arise from synchrotron radiation from extremely energetic protons @xcite .",
    "determining which of these emission mechanisms produces the observed x - ray jets in powerful quasars is a strong motivation for more observations of radio - loud quasars , and has resulted in a rapid increase in the number of known x - ray and optical jets .",

    "now the three great observatories collectively offer the possibility to identify the radiation mechanisms operating in powerful quasar jets .",
    "in fact , when combined with the data from the _ vla _ , _ hubble _ , and _",

    "is marginally found in the irac image , but it may be due to our incomplete psf subtraction , so we regard the knot a flux only as an upper limit .",
    "the hotspot at the counter - jet side also suffers from the uncertainties of psf subtraction ; we do not find an infrared counterpart and place an upper limit of @xmath24 at @xmath20 .",
    "also , we do not detect extended infrared emissions from the radio lobes .    to construct the broad - band seds of jet knots using multifrequency data , we derived infrared flux densities of some knot features at 3.6 and @xmath1 . given the small separation of adjacent knots , typically @xmath25 , we utilized a psf - fitting method @xcite .",
    "specifically , the jet image was fitted with a series of irac psfs , fixing the psf centers at the knot positions in the vla 22 ghz radio image .",

    "we employed a somewhat different method for x - ray photometry compared with @xcite .",
    "specifically , we here define two energy bands for photometry : 12 kev and 36 kev . integrating over the entire jet ( from knot",
    "a to hotspot hs ) we found 203 and 57 counts in the 12 and 36 bands , respectively ( also , 147 counts in the 0.61 kev band ) .",

    "we note that the infrared fluxes we have measured with the _ spitzer _ irac fill central points in the radio - to - x - ray seds of the jet knots , setting an important constraint on models of the broad - band emission .",

    "* for knot a ) , while in the outer knots the optical emission is related to the radio synchrotron component .",
    "these spectral characteristics are analogous to those of the jet in 3c  273 @xcite , for which we identified two spectral components : ( 1 ) the low - energy synchrotron spectrum extending from radio to infrared , and ( 2 ) the high - energy component arising in the optical and smoothly connecting to the x - ray flux .",
    "we argued that the second component is likely to be of synchrotron origin as well , thus forming double - synchrotron spectra , because of the similarity of polarization between optical and radio emission ( though the degrees of optical polarization are not established yet ) .",

    "for the inverse - compton model described later (  [ sec : iccmb ] ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : iccmb ] ) , however , the high - energy cutoff is located far beyond the x - ray domain , reaching very high - energy gamma - rays .",

    "[ fig : sed ] . instead of the normalization , @xmath98 , we present the total apparent luminosity ( without taking account of relativistic beaming ) defined as @xmath99 for each component , where the low - energy boundary of the integral is set at @xmath100 hz and @xmath101 hz for the first and second component , respectively .",
    "knot b , the most x - ray luminous one , has a luminosity of @xmath102 for the high - energy component , which indeed exceeds the luminosity of the low - energy component .",

    "while the low - energy emission from quasar jets is undoubtedly of synchrotron origin , the production mechanism(s ) of strong x - rays remains a matter of debate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "three radiation models have been proposed to explain the high - energy component : inverse - compton scattering by radio - emitting electrons , synchrotron radiation by a second electron population , and synchrotron radiation by energetic protons . in this section",
    "we consider each of these in turn .",
    "there are reasons to think that jets are relativistic on large scales @xcite and thus beaming may be important .",
    "the doppler beaming factor is defined as @xmath107^{-1}$ ] where @xmath108 is the velocity of the jet , @xmath109 is the bulk lorentz factor of the jet , and @xmath110 is the observing angle with respect to the jet direction . a one - sided jet with two - sided hotspots in this source is a sign of substantial relativistic beaming .",

    "all physical quantities are referred to a jet co - moving frame unless otherwise specified .",
    "the exceptions to this are the direction and velocity of the jet itself .",
    "it is assumed that a relativistically moving blob ( as noted by knot or hotspot ) has spherical geometry with a radius of @xmath111 kpc ( in the jet frame of reference ) occupied homogeneously with relativistic particles and magnetic fields (  one - zone \" model with a filling factor of unity ) .    before we discuss the high - energy emission component of the _ jet knots _ ( like knot b )",

    "in fact , since the average energy density of synchrotron photons ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in hotspot hs , @xmath113 , largely exceeds the cmb energy density of @xmath114 , the ssc flux well exceeds the ic / cmb flux in the hotspot of pks  1136@xmath0135 . we found a lower limit on magnetic field as @xmath115 in order not to violate the x - ray upper limit by the ssc emission . with an equipartition magnetic filed of @xmath116 where the energy density of relativistic electrons is equal to that of magnetic fields ,",
    "the one - zone ssc flux is an order of magnitude lower than the x - ray upper limit .",
    "we first discuss the second , x - ray - dominated component of the sed seen in the jet knots ( knot b , in particular ) in the framework of the beamed inverse - compton model @xcite , which has been advocated in the previous papers for this jet @xcite . in this model , it is assumed that the jet has a highly relativistic bulk velocity , with a lorentz factor @xmath3 out to distances of hundreds of kiloparsecs , so that the cmb field _ seen _ by electrons is enhanced by a factor of @xmath117 in the jet comoving frame .",
    "the amplified cmb can be compton up - scattered by high - energy electrons of @xmath118 into the observed x - rays .",
    "this model automatically requires that the jet direction is close to the line - of - sight , @xmath119 .",

    ", we shall briefly discuss this issue . )",
    "it is interesting to test the beamed ic / cmb hypothesis , particularly for the pks  1136@xmath0135 jet .",
    "the jet exhibits the evolution of multiwavelength emission along the jet , namely the increase of radio brightness accompanied by the decrease of x - ray brightness towards downstream . as detailed in @xcite ,",
    "such a behavior can be interpreted , within the framework of the beamed ic radiation , as being due to deceleration of the jet @xcite .",
    "specifically , @xcite concluded that the bulk lorentz factor of the jet decreases from @xmath120 ( knot b ) to @xmath121 ( knot e ) .",
    "if the beamed ic scenario is confirmed , we gain a new probe of the flow structure of the large - scale jets .",
    "let us apply a synchrotron plus beamed ic / cmb model of @xcite to the broadband sed of knot b. we also include ssc calculation for completeness .",
    "the both models adopt  one - zone \" emission , assuming an emitting blob with homogeneously filled with relativistic particles and magnetic fields .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the case of no - beaming ( @xmath112 ) , again , the average energy density of synchrotron photons in the knot , @xmath122 , exceeds the cmb energy density .",
    "the energy distribution of radiating electrons is assumed to be of the form @xmath123 , having a low - energy cutoff at @xmath124 and a high - energy exponential cutoff at @xmath125 , where @xmath126 denotes the electron s lorentz factor .",
    "the number index of electrons is set to be @xmath127 based on a typical radio index in this jet ( @xmath128 ) , and the high - energy cutoff is determined to be @xmath129 to produce the infrared flux .",
    "the magnetic field strength is adopted as @xmath130 , where @xmath131 g ; this relation ensures equipartition between relativistic electrons and magnetic fields , and keeps the peak frequency of the synchrotron radiation , @xmath132 . the bulk lorentz factor",
    "itself does not explicitly affect the discussion made here and it is adopted to be @xmath133 .",
    "figure  [ fig : icssc ] shows the ic / cmb and ssc x - ray fluxes as a function of @xmath134 , given the radio flux observed for knot b. since the normalization of the electron distribution scales as @xmath135 and the beaming pattern of the ic / cmb emission follows @xmath136 @xcite , the ic / cmb flux scales as @xmath137 .",
    "the ssc flux scales as @xmath138 , where @xmath139 . as such ,",
    "if the jet is heavily beamed , @xmath140 , the ic / cmb flux is dominant .",

    "[ fig : iccmb ] .",
    "the ssc becomes a main component for @xmath142 .",
    "even if we invoke a particle - dominated case of @xmath143 , the ssc model requires a significant de - beaming of @xmath144 to explain the observed x - rays , which is quite unlikely as the on - axis version of such jet emission becomes unacceptably luminous .",

    "the observation of pks  1136@xmath0135 ( or quasar jets in general ) with glast may be able to test the ic / cmb hypothesis . note that the sub - tev domains are subject to intergalactic absorption , which makes it difficult to investigate the jet emission with future ground - based cherenkov telescopes .",
    "the doppler factor of @xmath145 required by the ic / cmb model implies an uncomfortably small angle between the jet and the line - of - sight , @xmath146 .",
    "@xcite also derived the maximum angle permitted as @xmath147 for this jet .",
    "the small angle would make the jet quite long , @xmath148 , and the total source extent would be as large as the largest quasar .",
    "the core - to - lobe flux ratio at 5 ghz , @xmath149 , is an indicator of jet orientation . in the case of 1136@xmath0135 ,",
    "the core - to - lobe ratio of @xmath150 is obtained @xcite , thus designated as a _ lobe - dominated _ quasar . according to @xcite , a sample of radio - loud quasars with a median value of @xmath151",

    "however , it should be kept in mind that _ chandra_-detected jets can be biased toward smaller jet angles , which alleviates a problem of the jet angle .",
    "we need a more direct means to distinguish currently proposed models ( see  [ sec : discri ] ) .",
    "the large - scale jet in pks  1136@xmath0135 is in many respects similar to the well - known jet of quasar 3c  273 .",
    "as @xcite have pointed out , in both jets , the radio emission brightens monotonically towards the terminal hotspot , while the upstream knots are brighter in x - rays .",
    "the two - component seds are also similar ( cf , * ? ? ?",
    ". in the case of 3c  273 , since both the radio and optical emission are linearly polarized to a similar degree and in the same direction , it seems reasonable that the high - energy component , which contributes more than half the optical flux , should also arise from the synchrotron process @xcite .",
    "therefore we discuss the optical - to - x - ray component of 1136@xmath0135 in terms of synchrotron radiation produced by a second population of high - energy electrons .",

    "the power - law slope of electrons is derived from the radiation slope as @xmath154 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : fnu ] ) ] in a synchrotron - cooling regime as appropriate for optical and x - ray emission ; the _ cooled _ electrons responsible for the observed radiation have a steeper number index of @xmath155 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "then the spectral index of the high - energy component , @xmath106 corresponds to @xmath156 .",
    "however , within the framework of diffusive shock acceleration , the hardest possible electron distribution of acceleration would be @xmath157 , in other words , @xmath158 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the inferred index @xmath156 would violate such a theoretical limit .",
    "this brings into question the idea that the second electron distribution is formed through the diffusive shock acceleration or that there is a second electron distribution at all .",
    "note that the jet in 3c  273 has spectral index of @xmath159 corresponding to @xmath160 , which was considered to be compatible with the shock acceleration theory @xcite .",
    "the second synchrotron component in the pks  1136@xmath0135 jet may instead be due to turbulent acceleration operating in the shear layers @xcite .",
    "the coexistence of two distinct types of acceleration , shock and turbulent acceleration , in the knots would naturally give rise to a double - synchrotron spectrum .",
    "more importantly , unlike the shock acceleration , a hard spectrum , @xmath161 , can be expected to form in the case of turbulent acceleration ( i.e. , second - order fermi acceleration ) . in fully turbulent shear layers ,",
    "the time scale of turbulent acceleration can be estimated as @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is an electron gyroradius and @xmath164 denotes the alfvn velocity .",
    "the turbulent acceleration has to compete against synchrotron losses , which is presumed to dominate over ic losses , with a timescale of @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the thomson cross section , and @xmath167 is the energy density of the magnetic field . by equating @xmath168namely , balancing the acceleration and synchrotron loss rates ",

    "* ) , thus requiring @xmath172 .",
    "this condition is reasonable with typical jet parameters .",
    "finally , we argue the possibility that the optical - to - x - ray emission may be due to synchrotron radiation by very high energy _ protons _ @xcite .",
    "this model requires that protons in the jet are somehow accelerated to very high energies , @xmath173 or more . also , the magnetic field strength must be of the order @xmath174 , so that energy equipartition between the relativistic _ protons _ and magnetic fields can be ( roughly ) realized . the knots and hotspots in the relativistic jets of powerful quasars and radio galaxies",
    "are indeed one of a few potential sites of cosmic - ray acceleration up to @xmath175 @xcite .",
    "for example , the turbulent acceleration in the shear layer may be able to accelerate such ultra high energy protons @xcite .",
    "the characteristic frequency and cooling time of proton synchrotron radiation can be written as @xmath176 \\left ( \\frac{b}{\\rm mg}\\right )   \\left ( \\frac{e_{p}}{10^{18}\\ \\rm ev } \\right)^2\\   \\rm hz,\\ ] ] and @xmath177 respectively @xcite .",
    "( note that the synchrotron cooling time is much shorter than the photo - meson cooling time at energies relevant here . ) a total energy content of the magnetic field @xmath178 integrated over a spherical knot with a radius of @xmath179 amounts to @xmath180 .",
    "if we assume equipartition between radiating protons and magnetic fields , @xmath181 , the x - ray luminosity of synchrotron radiation by ultra - high - energy protons of @xmath173 can be estimated roughly as @xmath182 where @xmath183 denotes the fraction of kinetic energy of protons responsible for the x - ray emission .",
    "relativistic beaming is not taken into account in this estimate .",
    "roughly speaking , the luminosity scales with @xmath184 and @xmath134 such that @xmath185 .",
    "the expected luminosity agrees with typical ( apparent ) luminosity of the jet knots of quasars , @xmath186 , if @xmath187 .",
    "thus , very high energy protons rather than a second population of electrons , may explain the second synchrotron component extending from the optical to x - rays provided that both ultra - high - energy protons of @xmath173 and a magnetic field of @xmath174 are present in the jet knots . under the proton - synchrotron hypothesis ,",
    "the low - energy synchrotron emission may be accounted for by accompanying electrons .    to be specific",
    ", we modeled the high - energy spectral component of knot b with proton synchrotron radiation .",
    "we adopt mild beaming of @xmath188 ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "the low - energy spectral component was simultaneously modeled by electron synchrotron radiation with taking account of the effects of significant synchrotron cooling .",
    "it is assumed that during @xmath190 years , protons and electrons are injected continuously into the emission volume ( @xmath191 ) with the distributions characterized by number index @xmath192 and @xmath193 and by the maximum energy @xmath194 and @xmath195 : @xmath196 . in the bottom panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : iccmb ] , we present the broadband sed reproduced by the proton synchrotron model with the equipartition magnetic field of @xmath197 , the index of the power - law distribution of _ accelerated _ particles @xmath198 , and the maximum energy of @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "the injection rate of electrons , in terms of energy content @xmath201 , is about 5% of that of protons .",
    "the injected electrons suffer from severe synchrotron cooling .",
    "even radio - emitting electrons have a cooling time of only @xmath202 years , which requires _ in - situ _ acceleration of electrons .",
    "the infrared - emitting electrons have a lifetime of @xmath203 years , implying that each knot is a currently ( within @xmath204 years ) active site of particle acceleration .",
    "the energy density of protons @xmath205 , which is equal to @xmath206 , can be calculated by @xmath207 with @xmath208 , since synchrotron cooling of protons is not effective .",
    "the kinetic power of the jet , estimated as @xmath209 , amounts to @xmath210 .",
    "this estimate is not sensitive to the choice of @xmath211 as long as the equipartition condition is fulfilled .",
    "a large power has to be carried by the protons and magnetic fields in the jet to produce the x - ray emission via a proton - synchrotron process .",
    "the black hole mass that powers the jet is estimated to be @xmath212 @xcite using the empirical relation to the width of the h@xmath213 line and the optical continuum luminosity .",
    "the black hole mass corresponds to the eddington luminosity of @xmath214 .",
    "therefore , the proton synchrotron model requires the jet to be _ super - eddington _ , @xmath215 .",
    "this issue would pose a problem for the proton synchrotron model , though it may be alleviated by assuming that the knots present the locations of _ power peaks _ due to modulated activity of the central engine .",
    "we emphasize here that optical polarimetry can be an effective way of discriminating the radiation models responsible for the optical - to - x - ray emission of the jet in pks  1136@xmath0135 , and of quasar jets in general . in the beamed ic interpretation ,",
    "if the optical fluxes belong to the ic component , the optical and x - ray emission are due to compton up - scattering off the amplified cmb by high - energy electrons of @xmath216 ( optical ) and @xmath217 ( x - ray ) .",
    "unlike in the case of synchrotron models , the x - rays are expected to be _ unpolarized _ and the optical light is nearly unpolarized at most a few percent of polarization ( uchiyama & coppi , in preparation ) ( in the jet frame ) exists , namely  bulk comptonization \" , can yield in principle a high degree of polarization for a jet angle @xmath218 @xcite . for @xmath219 of a few as relevant here , however , the polarization is largely suppressed . ] .",
    "precise polarization measurements in the optical can in principle verify ( or discard ) the beamed ic model .",
    "unfortunately , there have been no useful polarization observations of quasar jets with _",
    "hst _ so far . only for 3c 273 ,",
    "early _ hst _ polarimetry of the jet was done but with the pre - costar foc and low significances @xcite . as was recently performed for nearby radio galaxies by @xcite , new , deep polarimetry of quasar jets on large - scales",
    "is highly encouraged , although the optical emission from the jet knots is generally faint , say @xmath220 @xcite .",
    "we have detected the infrared emission from the kiloparsec - scale jet in the quasar pks  1136@xmath0135 with the _ spitzer space telescope_. using the new _ spitzer _",
    "data together with deep _",
    "chandra _ , _ hubble _ , and multi - frequency vla observations from @xcite",
    ", we construct the broadband spectral energy distributions along the large - scale jet .",
    "the seds of the jet knots are comprised of two components : radio - to - infrared synchrotron emission and a separate high - energy component responsible for x - rays , which may extend down to the optical . in total",
    ", each component has a similar apparent luminosity of the order of @xmath221 .",
    "the origin of the high - energy component has significant implications to the properties of particle acceleration in a relativistic jet as well as jet dynamics .",
    "we consider three radiation models that have been proposed to explain the high - energy component : inverse - compton scattering in a highly relativistic jet , synchrotron radiation by a second electron population , and synchrotron radiation by highly energetic protons .    in terms of the double synchrotron scenario ,",
    "a flat spectrum of the second synchrotron component , @xmath222 , would turn down diffusive shock acceleration as the mechanism of electron acceleration to very high energies , @xmath223 tev .",
    "instead turbulent acceleration in the shear layers may explain the second population of electrons giving rise to the flat spectrum .",
    "in the beamed ic interpretation , a jet orientation with respect to the observer of @xmath146 is required , which is not quite favorable given the small core - to - lobe ratio of this object .",
    "future optical polarimetry or @xmath126-ray observations with glast may be able to test the beamed ic model .",
    "the proton synchrotron model requires a relatively large magnetic field of @xmath224 mg , and consequently large kinetic power of @xmath225 , with efficient acceleration of protons to @xmath226 .",
    "if this is the case , one can probe particle acceleration at very high energies , higher than any other known objects in the universe .",
