    "emergent geometry is a key concept in formulating a quantum theory of gravity because in such a theory space(time ) is believed to be not fundamental but emergent .",
    "a concrete realization of this notion has been achieved by the gauge / string duality @xcite , which states an equivalence between gauge theories and string theories .",
    "for instance , the duality between the @xmath10 matrix model and the two - dimensional string theory is known to be a prototype of the gauge / string duality ( see for reviews @xcite ) . in this duality",
    ", the matrix model can be mapped to a free fermion system .",
    "the fermi surface , which is the eigenvalue density of the @xmath10 matrix model , corresponds to one spatial direction of the dual two - dimensional geometry .",
    "another well - known example is the duality between 1/2-bps operators in @xmath1 super yang - mills theory ( sym ) and the bubbling geometries in type iib supergravity @xcite .",
    "the chiral primary operators in @xmath1 sym can also be mapped to the states of free fermions @xcite and its phase space can be identified with the droplets in the gravity dual @xcite .",
    "the same kind of correspondence is shown to exist for the 1/2-bps wilson loop operators in @xcite . in these cases also , the fermi surface corresponds to one spatial direction in the dual ten - dimensional geometry .",
    "other recent examples include the duality between wilson surfaces in six - dimensional @xmath11 theory and m - theory bubbling geometries @xcite .",
    "recently , yet another example of the emergent geometry has been demonstrated by the present authors and t. okada in @xcite .",
    "there , we studied the gauge / gravity duality between the plane wave matrix model ( pwmm ) and the bubbling geometry in type iia supergravity @xcite , which is explained in detail below .",
    "pwmm is a matrix quantum mechanics originally proposed as a formulation of m - theory in the light - cone frame on the pp - wave geometry @xcite .",
    "the theory is the mass deformation of the bfss matrix theory @xcite and has @xmath0 symmetry , which consists of @xmath12 bosonic symmetry . ] and 16 supersymmetries .",
    "pwmm possesses many discrete vacua , called fuzzy sphere , which are labeled by representations of @xmath13 .",
    "one can make the irreducible decomposition of the representations , so that the vacua are specified by irreducible representations and their multiplicities which appear in the decomposition .",
    "for each vacuum of pwmm , the dual gravity solution was constructed by lin and maldacena in type iia supergravity , which is known as the bubbling geometry @xcite .",
    "if @xmath0 symmetric ansatz is assumed , the equations of motion can be reduced to a simple differential equation with boundary conditions characterized by fermionic droplets on a particular one - dimensional line in ten - dimensions . solving this equation",
    "is shown to be equivalent to solving for an electrostatic potential of a three - dimensional axially symmetric electrostatic system with some conducting disks @xcite . in this duality ,",
    "the dimensions of irreducible representations of a fuzzy sphere vacuum correspond to ns5-brane charges and their multiplicities correspond to d2-brane charges . in the associated electrostatic system , they correspond to the positions and the charges of the conducting disks .",
    "see fig.1 for an electrostatic system for a general vacuum of pwmm .    in @xcite ,",
    "the duality for pwmm was studied in the case of the vacuum characterized by the direct sum of copies of an irreducible representation .",
    "the gravity dual of this theory was examined in @xcite , where the charge density on the conducting disk in the corresponding electrostatic system was shown to satisfy a fredholm integral equation of the second kind . in pwmm ,",
    "a 1/4-bps sector was considered .",
    "this sector is made of a complex scalar that corresponds to two spatial directions in the dual geometry on which the electrostatic system is defined . by applying the localization technique @xcite",
    ", this sector reduces to a matrix integral @xcite . by evaluating this matrix integral",
    ", it was found that the eigenvalue density of the matrix integral obeys the same integral equation as the charge density in the electrostatic problem .",
    "this fact naturally leads us to identify the eigenvalue density with the charge density .",
    "since the charge density completely determines the gravity solution , it was concluded that one can exactly reconstruct the gravity solution from pwmm .",
    "remarkably , the sector studied in @xcite is interacting and so the coupling constant appears as a parameter in this duality .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the examples given in the first paragraph , where the relevant sectors in the gauge theories are free and there is no coupling dependence .",
    "the existence of such an extra parameter makes the duality more attractive . actually , the gauge / gravity duality for pwmm admits two interesting limits that lead to the duality for other field theories @xcite .",
    "one is the d2-brane limit ( commutative limit of fuzzy sphere ) , in which pwmm becomes sym on @xmath4 , and the dual geometry asymptotically becomes d2-brane geometry .",
    "the other one is the ns5-brane limit , in which pwmm is considered to become type iia little string theory ( lst ) @xcite on @xmath14 , and the dual geometry asymptotically becomes ns5-brane geometry .",
    "thus , the study of the gauge / gravity duality for pwmm enables us to study that for sym on @xmath4 and even that for lst in a comprehensive manner .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the results of @xcite to the case of a general vacuum of pwmm .",
    "we first consider the gravity side .",
    "we solve the electrostatic problem for a general vacuum of pwmm by extending the method developed in @xcite .",
    "we then show that the electrostatic potential of the problem can be described in terms of the charge densities on each conducting disk and the charge densities satisfy a system of integral equations .",
    "next , we study the gauge theory side .",
    "we consider a general vacuum and analyze the 1/4-bps sector as in the previous paper @xcite . in this case",
    ", the 1/4-bps sector can be described by a multi - matrix integral @xcite .",
    "we show that the saddle point equations for the eigenvalue densities of the matrix integral are exactly the same as the system of integral equations for the charge densities in the corresponding electrostatic problem .",
    "thus , as in @xcite , we can identify the eigenvalue densities with the charge densities , which determine the gravity solution .",
    "this result shows that pwmm around a general vacuum can contain its gravity dual geometry as saddle point configurations of eigenvalues .",
    "moreover , we investigate the gauge / gravity duality for other gauge theories with @xmath0 symmetry , @xmath3 sym on @xmath4 and @xmath1 sym on @xmath2 . it was shown in @xcite that the gauge / gravity duality for sym on @xmath4 can be obtained from pwmm by taking the d2-brane limit and that for sym on @xmath2 by taking the t - duality as well as the d2-brane limit . using these relations , we prove the correspondence between eigenvalue densities in these theories and charge densities in the electrostatic systems associated with their gravity duals .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review the dual gravity solutions for gauge theories with @xmath0 symmetry and solve general electrostatic problems associated to these solutions . in section 3 , after reviewing pwmm and the matrix integral , we derive the saddle point equations for the eigenvalue densities .",
    "then , we show that the charge densities can be identified with the eigenvalue densities .",
    "finally , we discuss the cases for sym on @xmath4 and sym on @xmath2 .",
    "in this section , we elaborate the lin - maldacena solution for a general vacuum of the gauge theories with @xmath0 symmetry by analyzing the corresponding electrostatic system .",
    "we will show that the charge densities on each disk , which determine the gravity solution , satisfy a system of integral equations .",
    "first , we review the lin - maldacena solution @xcite , which is the solution with @xmath0 symmetry in type iia supergravity .",
    "the solution is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and the dots and primes denote @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "a remarkable feature of this solution is that it is written in terms of a single function @xmath19 .",
    "the killing spinor equation in the supergravity imposes a condition that @xmath19 satisfies the laplace equation in a three - dimensional axially symmetric electrostatic system , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 represent coordinates for the transverse and the axial directions , respectively .",
    "the regularity of the metric requires that the electrostatic system must consist of some conducting disks with radii tuned such that the charge densities vanish at the edges . in addition , from the positivity of the metric , there must be a certain background potential .",
    "so , the potential @xmath19 consists of these two contributions : @xmath22        the electrostatic system is determined once a theory and its vacuum are specified . the electrostatic system relevant to pwmm consists of an infinite conducting plate at @xmath23 , some finite conducting disks in the region of @xmath24 ( fig.1 ) and the background potential of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a constant .",
    "the electrostatic system relevant to @xmath3 sym on @xmath4 consists of some finite conducting disks in the region @xmath27 ( fig.2 ) and the background potential of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a constant .",
    "the electrostatic system relevant to @xmath1 sym on @xmath2 consists of an infinite number of finite conducting disks arranged periodically along the @xmath21-axis ( fig.3 ) and the background potential .",
    ", which do not contribute to the gravity solution . ]     ( left ) and sym on @xmath2 ( right ) .",
    "the conducting disks in the right figure are arranged periodically.,title=\"fig:\",height=264 ]   ( left ) and sym on @xmath2 ( right ) .",
    "the conducting disks in the right figure are arranged periodically.,title=\"fig:\",height=264 ]    the condition that the charge densities vanish at the edges of the disks relates the radii of the disks and the charges .",
    "so the independent parameters of this solution are the total charges and the @xmath21-coordinates of the disks , as well as @xmath26 in or @xmath29 in .    while @xmath26 and @xmath29 are related to the magnitude of the dilaton , the other parameters turn out to be related to the brane charges .",
    "this geometry has an @xmath30 and an @xmath31 at each point on the @xmath20-@xmath21 plane .",
    "one can show that on the @xmath21-axis the radius of @xmath31 becomes zero , while on the finite conducting disks , the radius of @xmath30 becomes zero .",
    "so one can consider a various non - contractible @xmath32 s or @xmath33 s which are given by fibering the @xmath30 or @xmath31 on the path ( on the @xmath20-@xmath21 plane ) ending on different disks or on different segments of the @xmath21-axis , respectively . on each @xmath32 or @xmath33 , one can measure the nsns - flux or the rr - flux .",
    "this relates the parameters of the electrostatic system to the brane charges . as an example , let us consider the electrostatic system for pwmm with @xmath34 finite plates ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . we denote the total charge , the radius and the @xmath21-coordinate of @xmath35-th disk by @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively , where @xmath39 . in this case , there are @xmath34 independent non - contractible @xmath32 s and the same number of @xmath33 s in the geometry . @xmath36 and",
    "@xmath38 are related to the d2-brane charges @xmath40 and the ns5-brane charges @xmath41 as @xmath42 for @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath44 denotes the position of the infinite plate .",
    "we will show in section [ emergent bubbling geometry ] how the parameters of the electrostatic system are mapped to those of the corresponding gauge theory .      in the following ,",
    "we derive a fredholm integral equation which determines @xmath45 in ( [ vbg+tildev ] ) .",
    "we consider the situation shown in fig.1 and denote the solution of @xmath45 in the region @xmath46 by @xmath47 , where @xmath35 runs from @xmath48 to @xmath34 and @xmath49 is assumed .",
    "we first note that a general solution to the laplace equation in an axially symmetric system is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the bessel function of the first kind of order zero and @xmath52 is a positive real number .",
    "so we can write @xmath47 as @xmath53 now we have the boundary condition that @xmath54 as @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this means @xmath57 we also have some continuation conditions for @xmath58 s at @xmath59 .",
    "first , at @xmath60 , @xmath58 should be equal to @xmath61 .",
    "this is satisfied if @xmath62 second , when @xmath60 and @xmath63 , not only @xmath64 but also @xmath65 should be continuous .",
    "so we have @xmath66 for @xmath63 .",
    "third , when @xmath60 and @xmath67 ( i.e. on the conducting disk ) , the value of @xmath68 should be constant : @xmath69 . in terms of @xmath70 and @xmath71 ,",
    "this is written as @xmath72 in order to solve the conditions ( [ first cond ] ) , ( [ second cond ] ) and ( [ third cond ] ) , we define @xmath73 for @xmath74 . from ( [ bc for cd ] ) and ( [ first cond ] ) , @xmath70 and @xmath71 can be written in terms of @xmath75 as @xmath76 by substituting ( [ def of a ] ) and ( [ cd in terms of a ] ) to ( [ second cond ] ) and ( [ third cond ] ) , we obtain @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are given by @xmath80 as shown in appendix  [ dual integral equations ] , the equations ( [ equations for a ] ) can be reduced to the integral equations , ( [ dual eq for h2 ] ) and ( [ dual eq for h1 ] ) , for the functions @xmath81 defined by ( [ def of hs ] ) , @xmath82 and @xmath83 in appendix  [ dual integral equations ] corresponds to @xmath34 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 in our problem , respectively . ] . for our problem , it is more convenient to work with the variables @xmath86 then , ( [ dual eq for h1 ] ) is written for @xmath87 as @xmath88f_{t}(u )   \\nonumber\\\\   = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\left ( \\delta_s + \\frac{2}{3}v_0 d_s^3 -2v_0 d_s x^2 \\right ) , \\label{integral eq for fs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and ( [ dual eq for h2 ] ) shows that @xmath89 is vanishing outside the region @xmath90 $ ] .",

    ", we have @xmath97 on the other hand , this is equal to @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the charge density for the @xmath20 direction .",
    "hence , the total charge on the disk can be computed as @xmath100 these relations show that @xmath101 corresponds to the charge density on the @xmath35-th plate projected onto a diameter direction .",
    "these densities are fully determined by ( [ integral eq for fs ] ) and so is the potential which can be written in terms of @xmath102 as @xmath103f_s(t ) .",

    "this can be obtained from that for sym on @xmath4 by compactifying the @xmath21 direction to @xmath119 with the background potential intact @xcite .",
    "we start from the solution for sym on @xmath4 , and , with disks periodically arranged .",
    "we change the labelling of the disks so that they are labelled by two integers @xmath120 , where @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "@xmath35 is a label of a single period and @xmath123 is that of each disk in the period .",
    "so each period consists of @xmath124 conducting disks .",
    "we put the position of each disk to be @xmath125 the charge @xmath126 and the radius @xmath127 of each disk is independent of @xmath35 : @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",

    "using the fact that @xmath223 can be approximated to @xmath224 as @xmath225 , we obtain the following saddle point equations @xmath226\\rho^{(t)}(u ) { \\nonumber \\\\}&=\\frac{\\mu_s}{\\pi}-\\frac{2d_s}{\\pi g^2}x^2 , \\label{saddle eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath227 and @xmath220 are determined from @xmath228    notice that the saddle point equations of the eigenvalue densities take a very similar form as the integral equations for the charge densities . in fact , by using the relations ( [ d d ] ) and ( [ v0 ] ) , one can find that they are exactly the same equations .",
    "thus , we arrive at the relations @xmath229 and @xmath230 namely , the eigenvalue density on the gauge theory side has exactly the same functional form and parameter dependence as the charge density on the gravity side , up to the trivial rescaling . hence , they can naturally be identified with each other and this identification relates the degrees of freedom on the gauge theory side to the background geometry on the gravity side . by integrating both sides of over @xmath221 $ ] and using and , we find that those relations are consistent with and .",
    "if one finds exact solutions of and , one can check the relations , and , more explicitly . although we could not find general exact solutions , still we can solve those equations in particular parameter regions .",
    "if a conducting disk is isolated at a distance from the other disks , the term with an integration in the integral equation of the disk becomes negligible .",
    "then , the solution is simply given by a quadratic function .",
    "this is effectively the same situation as the d2-brane limit with @xmath153 considered in @xcite . in the same way",
    ", we can consider two isolated disks which effectively form the same system as the ns5-brane limit with @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "in these cases , one can find the exact solutions and check the relations , and , more directly .",
    "the equivalence between the charge density and the eigenvalue density also holds for the other gauge theories with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "as shown in section [ localization s2 s3/zk ] , in the d2-brane limit , the partition function reduces to the matrix integral for sym on @xmath4 given by .",
    "in addition , by taking the t - duality , we end up with the matrix integral for sym on @xmath2 given by .",
    "if we apply the corresponding limits to the integral equation of the charge density , we obtain the integral equations and for sym on @xmath4 and sym on @xmath2 , respectively . in these cases , the integral equations and for the charge densities",
    "can also be identified with the saddle point equations for and , respectively , where the same relations as and hold .",
    "in this paper , we showed that the bubbling geometries in type iia supergravity are realized in the gauge theories with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we found that the charge densities of the electrostatic systems in the gravity dual are equivalent to the eigenvalue densities of the matrix integrals which govern the 1/4-bps sector of the gauge theories .    on the gravity side ,",
    "the bubbling geometries are given in terms of the electrostatic potential of electrostatic systems with conducting disks .",
    "first , we have considered the electrostatic system corresponding to pwmm around a general vacuum .",
    "we have shown that the boundary conditions of the potential are given by a system of dual integral equations . extending the method to analyze the dual integral equations written in @xcite , we have reduced the dual integral equations to the fredholm integral equations of the second kind for the charge densities on the disks . by taking the d2-brane limit or performing the t - duality as well as the d2-brane limit , we have also obtained the same type of integral equations for the charge densities in the electrostatic system corresponding to sym on @xmath4 or sym on @xmath2 .    on the gauge theory side",
    ", we have investigated the matrix integrals that describe 1/4-bps sectors of the gauge theories .",
    "first , we have considered the case for pwmm around a general vacuum in the regime where the supergravity approximation is valid . in this regime , we have derived the saddle point equations of the eigenvalue densities of the matrix integral , which are almost the same integral equations for the charge densities on the gravity side .",
    "then we have found that under the identifications of and the integral equations of the eigenvalue densities are exactly equivalent to those for the charge densities . as the d2-brane limit and the t - duality of pwmm lead to the other gauge theories with @xmath0 symmetry , that is , sym on @xmath4 and sym on @xmath2 ,",
    "we have also shown the equivalence of the charge densities and the eigenvalue densities .",
    "thus , we have concluded that since the bubbling geometries are completely determined by the charge densities the geometries are constructed from the eigenvalue densities of the gauge theories with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "finally , let us comment on iia lst on @xmath14 , which is another theory with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "like other @xmath0 symmetric theories , lst on @xmath14 is thought to have many discrete vacua and for each vacuum there exists a gravity dual given by type iia bubbling geometry @xcite .",
    "the gravity dual of lst around the trivial vacuum was elaborated in @xcite and shown to be obtained from a double scaling limit of the gravity dual of pwmm around a particular vacuum .",
    "although it is also expected that the gravity dual of lst around a general vacuum can be obtained from the same kind of double scaling limit of the gravity dual of pwmm , some careful analysis seems to be needed .",
