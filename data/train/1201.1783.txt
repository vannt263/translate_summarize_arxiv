    "risk measures are real valued functionals defined on a space of random variables which encloses every possible financial position .",
    "it may seem naive to use a single number to describe the complexity of the distributions characterizing those random variables . on the other hand this appears as the only way to succeed in the assessment of the capital requirement needed to a bank to recover a high possible loss due to risky investments . without any doubt",
    "it is a critical point the choice of the axioms defining the risk measures ; these have been vividly discussed since the very beginning of this theory , opening a broad new branch of research which still triggers the interest of the mathematical finance world .",
    "seminal contributions to this topics were surprisingly given by bernoulli in 1738 @xcite , who perceived the role of the risk aversion in decision making .",
    "this was the starting point of the notion of _ expected utility_. later on , in a financial environment , many risk procedure were introduced .",
    "it was the case of the _ mean - variance _ criterion ( markovitz , 1952,@xcite ) , the _ sharpe s ratio _ ( 1964,@xcite ) and the _ value at risk _",
    "( @xmath0 ) , defined through the quantiles of a given distribution with a predefined level of probability .",
    "this last method is the most employed in credit institutes and has been pointed out as the reference parameter by the basel committee on banking supervision ( basel ii 2006 ) .    at the end of the nineties , artzner , delbaen , eber and heath",
    "produced a rigorous axiomatic formalization of coherent risk measures , led by normative intent .",
    "the regulating agencies asked for computational methods to estimate the capital requirements , exceeding the unmistakable lacks showed by the extremely popular @xmath0 . given a vector space of random variables @xmath1 , the definition of a _ coherent risk measure _ @xmath2 requires four main hypotheses to be satisfied : monotonicity , cash additivity , positive homogeneity , sublinearity ( see section [ rm ] ) .",
    "the relevant role of the axioms was deeply discussed in many papers : f@xmath3llmer and schied ( 2002,@xcite ) , frittelli and rosazza gianin ( 2002,@xcite ) independently studied the convex case weakening positive homogeneity and sublinearity .",
    "el karoui and ravanelli relaxed the cash additivity axiom to cash subadditivity ( 2009,@xcite ) when the market presents illiquidity ; maccheroni et al .",
    "( 2010,@xcite ) showed how quasiconvexity describes better than convexity the principle of diversification , whenever cash additivity does not hold .",
    "+ finally two important recent generalizations were introduced by jouini et al .",
    "( 2004,@xcite ) , who defined set - valued coherent risk measures , and by hamel and heyde ( 2010,@xcite ) who introduced the notion of set - valued convex risk measure .",
    "this approach is absolutely natural as far as the risk is expressed and hedged in different currencies .",
    "diversification plays a crucial role in insurance and financial business and the interpretation of this notion was the source of this vivid debate .",
    "an agent who considers a fixed basket of financial instruments @xmath4 tries to reallocate his wealth , by means of a diversified strategy @xmath5 , in order to minimize the risk of his portfolio .",
    "namely , given a real valued risk measure ( as introduced in @xcite ) @xmath6 we have the following optimization model @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the usual scalar product in @xmath9 .",
    "+ the optimal risk allocation is a classical problem in mathematical economics and it is interesting from both practical and theoretical perspectives . in more recent years this problem has also been studied in many other contexts such as risk exchange , assignment of liabilities to daughter companies , individual hedging problems ( see , for instance , the papers by heath and ku ( 2004,@xcite ) , barrieu and el karoui ( 2005,@xcite ) , burgert and ruschendorf ( 2006,@xcite ) , jouini et al .",

    "the aim of this paper is to provide a computational procedure , based on the goal programming ( gp ) model , to problem ( [ realopti ] ) if the agent has to find the best compromise among different beliefs which may come either from the uncertainty on the probabilistic model @xmath10 , or from different opinion that the agent has to face in his institution .",
    "these multi - criteria will be aggregated in a unique measure of risk which will be described by a set - valued map @xmath11 . in",
    "particular @xmath12 stands for the number of financial instruments considered , whereas @xmath13 is the number of different criteria ( which in general might be larger that @xmath12 as shown in section [ examples ] ) .",
    "thus the interpretation we are giving to @xmath14 appears pretty different to the original one provided in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ rm ] we recall some basic notions on set valued risk measures , section [ optimal ] is devoted to the extension of the optimization problem ( [ realopti ] ) to the case of set - valued risk measures , section [ mop ] introduces a gp model with satisfaction function and finally section [ examples ] presents some numerical results .",
    "let @xmath15 a probability space and we denote with @xmath16 the space of @xmath17 measurable random variables that are @xmath18 almost surely finite .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 the space of @xmath10-almost surely bounded random variables which becomes a banach lattice once endowed with the @xmath10-almost sure pointwise partial order and the usual norm of the supremum . in this probabilistic framework",
    "we recall the definition of risk measure .",
    "a risk measure is a functional @xmath6 which satisfies    * _ monotonicity _ , i.e. @xmath20 implies @xmath21 for every @xmath22 ,    moreover a risk measure may satisfy    * _ convexity _ , i.e. @xmath23 for all @xmath24 $ ] . * _ cash additivity _ , i.e. @xmath25 , * _ positive homogeneity _ , i.e. for every @xmath26 , @xmath27 , * _ sublinearity _ , i.e. @xmath28 .    monotonicity represents the minimal requirement for a risk measure to model the preferences of a rational agent .",
    "if in addition conditions iii ) , iv ) and v ) hold then the risk measure is called coherent and it is automatically convex . unfortunately both axioms iv ) and v ) appear to be restrictive and unrealistic : the former does not sense the presence of liquidity risks , the latter does not describe the real intuition hidden behind the diversification process . for this reason in most of the literature iv ) and v ) are substituted by ii ) which has a natural interpretation : the risk of the diversified aggregated position @xmath29 is surely smaller than the combination of the two single risks .",
    "cash additivity is a key property which allows to characterize the risk procedure in terms of capital requirements @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the acceptance sets .",
    "the risk of a position @xmath32 is thus the minimal amount of money that i have to save today in order to make the position acceptable with respect to a precise criterion ( represented by the acceptance set @xmath33 ) which is usually imposed by regulation agencies ( external risk measures ) . on the other hand an institution may have some specific criteria that need to be enclosed in their model as in the case of internal risk measures .    in literature ,",
    "some extensions of the notion of risk measure have been considered in order to better describe the complexity of the risk process .",
    "we now recall the notion of set valued risk measures presented in @xcite . given any subset @xmath34 we shall denote by @xmath35 the collection of @xmath36-valued random variable @xmath37 with finite @xmath38 norm ( or equivalently @xmath39 for every @xmath40 ) .",
    "whenever no confusion arises we denote @xmath41 .",
    "notice that for @xmath42 we end up with essentially bounded random vectors of dimension @xmath12 .",
    "+ in this paper we take into account the theoretical framework developed in @xcite and @xcite : consider a closed convex cone @xmath43 ( resp .",
    "@xmath44 ) such that @xmath45 ( resp .",
    "@xmath46 ) and define the partial ordering @xmath47 on @xmath9 by @xmath48 iff @xmath49 ( similarly for @xmath50 on @xmath51 ) .",
    "this ordering can be naturally extended to @xmath52 in the following way : @xmath53 hence @xmath54 is a cone that consists in all the non - negative random variables in the sense of @xmath55 .",
    "+ moreover for any @xmath56 we may define the partial order @xmath50 as @xmath57 we will indicate by @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) the vector such that each component is equal to @xmath60 , by @xmath61 ( @xmath61 ) the vector such that the j@xmath62 component is @xmath60 and the other are @xmath63 .",

    "a similar observation might be repeated for all the other properties : convexity / sublinearity state that the diversification / aggregation decrease the risk of the portfolio and positively homogeneity excludes any liquidity risk .",

    "we motivate the use of set valued risk measures instead of vector valued : if we consider different agents we are allowed to give different weights to each one of them , depending on the reliability .",

    "the recent notion of set - valued risk measure appears as powerful tool that can be exploited to overcome many complications that arise in risk management .",
    "risk , understood as capital requirements needed to cover expected future losses , becomes an ambiguous factor to determine as far as a manager has to face different criteria or is uncertain on the real probabilistic model that lays underneath the financial problem .",
    "inspired from the statistical notion of confidence intervals , the general definition presented in this paper allows to consider compact valued risk measures . in this way we associate to any financial position a cloud of different risk levels , instead of a single number , taking into account all the multiplicity of ingredients that characterize this computation .",
    "as illustrated by some examples we may thus formulate an optimal risk diversification problem which allocates the risk of a given portfolio in an optimal manner .",
    "this is a set valued program which can be reduced to a vector valued model if the images of the set valued mapping admit an ideal point .",
    "using a goal programming approach with satisfaction function we are able to provide approximate solutions to this vector model : the presence of several free parameters is the strength of this approach since this allows a calibration of the model sensitive to the risk aversion of the agent .",
    "+ we have then illustrated three different examples which support this approach : in the first and the second one , the agent has fixed a risk procedure @xmath119 but he is uncertain about the probabilistic model @xmath325 . in such a case the functional form of @xmath326 will explicitly depend on @xmath325 and the standard literature would suggest to take a supremum @xmath327 to compute the capital requirement . as explained above , such a strategy would often force the agent to avoid any risk in his decision . through the gp model we find a non trivial diversification strategy which takes into account all these different possible scenarios @xmath325 . in the third example we provide a case of compact - valued risk measure built up from the celebrated value at risk .",
    "as well known , the valued at risk is convex only on the space of gaussian random variables , but it looses this property if we extend its domain to more general random variables . as a consequence the @xmath0 is not sensitive to diversification and for this reason it might not fit our optimization problem .",
    "the method we have proposed in an illustrative setting is a natural starting point to overcome this controversial and debated feature of the @xmath0 .",
