    "the amount of information about the galaxy population at high redshift ( @xmath9 ) has increased tremendously in the last few years . using the lyman - break technique several hundred",
    "high redshift star forming galaxies , lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) , have been detected and studied with imaging and spectroscopy ( steidel et al .",
    "it is , however , not yet known how complete the lyman - break technique is in detecting high redshift galaxies .",
    "an independent route along which to study the galaxy population at high redshift is via the high column density qso absorption lines systems .",
    "the advantage of high column density qso absorption lines systems is that a wealth of information on the chemical evolution can be and has been obtained by studying the metallicity and dust content of the absorbers from high resolution spectroscopic studies of the background qsos ( e.g. lu et al . 1996 ) .",
    "however , the spectroscopic studies will not tell us anything about the emission properties of the absorbing galaxies .    only when combining the information obtained from the lbg - studies ( e.g. the luminosity function of lbgs ) , the absorption line statistics for qso absorption lines systems and the properties of galaxy counterparts of qso absorption lines systems can we hope to disentangle the observational selection biases which each of the different studies suffer from and obtain a more complete insight into the nature of the high redshift galaxy population .",
    "the absorption line systems with the highest hi column density , @xmath10 cm@xmath5 , are the damped ly@xmath0 absorbers ( dlas , wolfe et al .",
    "1986 ) cm@xmath5 as dlas , e.g. lanzetta et al . 1997 . ] .",
    "such high hi column densities are at low redshift only found in the disks of spiral galaxies .",
    "it it also interesting to note , that active star formation in spiral galaxies only occurs when the hi column density of the disk exceeds @xmath12 ( kennicutt 1989 ) . for these reasons ,",
    "dlas are widely believed to trace the central parts of forming galaxies .",
    "much telescope time has been dedicated to the narrow band imaging of dlas over the past decade ( e.g. lowenthal et al . 1995 and references therein ) , but so far resulting in only two confirmed detections for the dlas towards pks0528 - 250 ( mller & warren 1993a , b ; warren & mller 1996 ) , and q0151 + 048a ( mller et al . 1998a ; fynbo et al .",
    "1999a ) in addition a spectroscopically confirmed broad band detection of the dla towards dms2247 - 0209 ( djorgovski 1998 ) and a purely spectroscopic detection of ly@xmath0 emission from the dla towards q2059 - 360 have been reported ( pettini et al .",
    "1995 , leibundgut & robertson 1998 ) , as well as a number of dla candidates , which have not yet been confirmed by spectroscopy ( steidel et al .",

    "1997 ) .",
    "qso absorption line systems with n(hi ) larger than a few times @xmath13 cm@xmath5 are optically thick at the lyman limit and refered to as lyman limit systems ( llss ) .",
    "lyman limit absorption is believed to occur in extended gaseous haloes of galaxies , because the neutral hydrogen column density is much larger than in the intergalactic medium and the gas is not predominantly neutral as in dlas . at low redshifts , where the lyman limit can not be observed from the ground ,",
    "lls are thought to be traced by mgii absorption , because mgii absorption only occurs in optically thick clouds ( schaeffer 1983 ) .",
    "the extensive study of the galaxy counterparts of mgii absorbers presented in guillemin & bergeron ( 1997 ) shows that mgii absorption predominantly occurs in sbc or scd galaxies , but that the objects range from ellipticals to irregular galaxies . at high redshifts",
    "the lyman break technique were originally used to look for galaxies responsible for lyman limit absorption in qso spectra ( steidel & hamilton 1992 ) .",
    "two candidates were found in six fields ( steidel et al . 1995 ) , but for only one of these , the lls towards q2233 + 131 , has confirming spectroscopy been published ( djorgovski et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "three out of the four confirmed high redshift dlas that have been detected in emission at present are at approximately the same redshift as the background qso . in order to examine whether @xmath14 systems indeed are more active emitters ( e.g. due to induced star formation or to photoionisation by the qso ; for the suggested mechanisms see mller & warren 1993b and fynbo et al .",
    "1998a ) we have initiated a programme aimed at studying the galaxy counterparts of this special subgroup of high column density qso absorption line systems . as part of this programme we chose to study the quasar q1205 - 30 of which a spectrum published by lanzetta et al .",
    "( 1991 ) shows the presence of a strong lls close to the emission redshift of the qso .",
    "the redshift of the quasar is @xmath15 .    in sect .",
    "2 of this paper we describe the observations obtained with the eso new technology telescope ( ntt ) and the basic data reduction . in sect .",
    "3 we discuss the photometry , the selection of ly@xmath0 emission line candidates , and the correction for the quasar point spread function . in sect .",
    "4 we discuss our results .",
    "we adopt a hubble constant of 100h@xmath6 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 and assume @xmath7=1 and @xmath16=0 unless otherwise stated .",
    "a spectrum of the quasar q1205 - 30 can be found in lanzetta et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , but its celestial coordinates were never made publicly available . to obtain an image we therefore had to `` rediscover ''",
    "q1205 - 30 on a copy of the prism plate uj9085p kindly made available to us from the uk schmidt telescope objective prism survey ( for details of the procedure see fynbo et al .",
    "celestial coordinates of q1205 - 30 are ra 12 05 35.72 , dec -30 14 25.8 ( 1950 ) .",
    "deep imaging of the field was subsequently carried out in ntt service mode ( silva & quinn 1997 , silva 1998 , woudt & silva 1999 ) .",
    "the field was imaged through standard b and bessel i filters , as well as through a special 20  ( fwhm ) narrow band filter manufactured by custom scientific .",
    "the narrow band filter ( cs 4906/20 ) is centred at 4906 , which is the wavelength of redshifted ly@xmath0 at @xmath17 .",
    "the service mode data were obtained with the eso multi - mode instrument ( emmi ) on the ntt during several nights of january , february and march , 1998 .",
    "the ccd used in the red arm of emmi was a site tk2048 with a pixel scale of 0.27 arcsec .",
    "the blue arm ccd was a site tk1024 with a pixel scale of 0.35 arcsec .",
    "the total integration times in each filter and the seeing in each of the combined frames are given in table 1 .",

    "i  band imaging was obtained with the red arm of emmi .",
    "the ccd in the red arm of emmi can be read in either single port ( d only ) or dual port ( a + d ) read  out mode .",
    "unfortunately it showed up that for our programme a mix of single and dual port read  out had been employed , and we had to follow a somewhat complex reduction procedure to make up for this .",
    "the disadvantage of the single port read  out is the longer read time required ( which is particularly a problem while obtaining twilight flats ) .",
    "the disadvantage of the dual port read  out is that the bias level , the gain ( and drift of the gain ) , and the readout noise are different for the two image sections .",
    "also the locations of traps ( bad columns ) depend on the direction of charge transfer along the columns .",
    "in particular the section read through port a has more bad columns than the same section read through port d. the i  band science exposures of q1205 - 30 were read out using dual port read  out , whereas the exposures of standard stars were read out using single port mode only .",
    "this mixed mode operation requires 2 sets of biases , as well as two sets of flat fields , and two different ways of reducing the images .",
    "twilight flats were only obtained for single port mode ( appropriate for the standard star exposures ) , while dome flat were taken with dual port read  out ( appropriate for the science frames ) .",
    "the dual read exposures were treated as if the a and d subsections were two individual frames .",
    "finally , bias frames , flat field exposures , and science exposures were pasted together to form 2048x2046 frames .",
    "the subsequent flat - fielding was done in the usual way .",
    "the ccd in the blue arm of emmi can be read in single port mode only .",
    "all science frames obtained with the blue arm of emmi ( all b  band and narrow band data ) were bias  subtracted and flat  fielded using standard routines .",
    "following the basic reduction the images in each of the three filters were combined employing the code described in mller & warren ( 1993a ) .",
    "this code optimizes the signal  to  noise for faint objects in the field , for which the noise is well understood via propagation of read  out  noise and photon shot noise .",
    "all magnitudes quoted in this paper are on the ab system .",
    "the narrow band data were calibrated directly onto the ab system using the spectrophotometric standard stars , and these magnitudes are denoted @xmath18 .",
    "we found that the colour terms for both the i and b filters were consistent with zero , hence we use the equations @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( fukugita et al .",
    "1995 ) to put the broad band magnitudes onto the ab system .",

    "[ fig4 ] , q1205 - 30 has only a slight excess emission in the narrow band filter which covers ly@xmath0 of the quasar also .",
    "the weakness of this excess emission is the result of the blue wing of the ly@xmath0 emission line of the qso being absorbed partly by the lyman limit absorber .",
    "we have detected an object , s6 , with extended line emission north and east of the quasar q1205 - 30 .",
    "the emission line of s6 is detected in a narrow band tuned to ly@xmath0 of a lyman limit absorber in front of q1205 - 30 , and the most likely interpretation is , that we see the lyman limit absorber in ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "spectroscopic follow ",
    "up is required to confirm this tentative conclusion .",
    "the large residuals from the psf subtraction of the quasar introduce errors in both the total line luminosity observed , and the impact parameter .",
    "we have therefore considered two extreme cases described in sect .",
    "[ photnear ] ; the minimal ly@xmath0 flux case ( model a ) and the maximal ly@xmath0 flux case ( model b ) . for the ly@xmath0 luminosity and the impact parameter in the two models we find l=11.6@xmath211.1 @xmath3 10@xmath4 h@xmath5 erg s@xmath6(14.1@xmath211.3 @xmath3 10@xmath4 h@xmath5 erg s@xmath6 ) and d=6.5 h@xmath6 kpc ( 5.4 h@xmath6 kpc ) for model a ( model b ) . in the following",
    "we will assume the more likely model b to be correct .",
    "fynbo et al .",
    "( 1999a , their table 4 ) lists the ly@xmath0 line luminosities of the known galaxy counterparts of high redshifts dlas and llss , namely the dlas towards pks0528 - 250 ( named s1 ) , q0151 + 048a ( named s4 ) and q2059 - 360 , and the lls towards q2233 + 131 .",
    "the observed ly@xmath0 line luminosity of s6 is within the range 1.112 @xmath3 10@xmath22 h@xmath5 erg s@xmath6 of these other systems .",
    "the size of the line emission region is 6@xmath34 arcsec@xmath23 corresponding to 22@xmath314 h@xmath5 kpc@xmath23 at z=3.036 .",
    "this size and the morphology of s6 are both near  identical to those of the emission line object s4 , which has been shown in a spectroscopic study ( mller et al .",
    "1998 ) to be a dla galaxy unrelated to the underlying quasar . before the precise systemic redshifts of both the qso and s6",
    "have been measured we can not exclude that s6 is related to q1205 - 30 .    from neither s4 , nor s6 , do we detect what is obviously continuum emission from a high redshift galaxy .",
    "this , however , is not surprising as continuum emission from the high redshift dla galaxy s1 was not detected in the deep ground based images of s1 ( mller & warren , 1993a ) , but a compact galaxy was subsequently found in the hst images ( mller & warren 1998 ) . since the impact parameters of s1 , s4 , and s6 are similar , clearly hst imaging is required to resolve the question of their continuum morphology .    both the comparatively large luminosity and the extended morphology of s6 is in contrast to six faint and compact emission line galaxies ( s7s12 ) found at much larger distances from the quasar .",
    "we hence consider it likely , as in the case of q2059 - 360 ( leibundgut & robertson 1998 , fynbo et al .",
    "1999a ) , that the emission from s6 is significantly influenced by the proximity of the active nucleus .",
    "it is , however , possible that gravitational lensing by the red galaxy g2 , if it is a foreground elliptical galaxy , makes s6 appear more extended and increases its observed flux . here",
    "we estimate the likely strength of this effect .    assuming that g2 is at z=0.5 and has an isothermal mass profile with a velocity dispersion of 300 km s@xmath6 , the radius of its einstein ring is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the proper angular diameter distances between g2 ( lens ) and s6 ( source ) and between the earth and s6 respectively , in the assumed cosmology .",
    "gravitational lensing in this simple model moves s6 and q1205 - 30 by an angle @xmath27 in the radial direction away from g2 causing a tangential stretching of s6 as well as an increase of the observed impact parameter of s6 relative to q1205 - 30 by a factor of @xmath28=2.3 ( where @xmath29=2.8 arcsec is the observed impact parameter of g2 relative to the qso ) .",
    "the magnification of the flux of s6 would be in the range 210 depending on the unknown size and orientation of the diamond caustic of g2 .",
    "a possible counter image on the eastern side of g2 would make s6 look more extended in the relatively low resolution of the narrow band image , in the direction of the observed elongation which would be of order 2@xmath27 .",
    "the presence of the six emission line galaxies s7s12 in the field of q1205 - 30 is interesting for several reasons .",
    "the faintness of the broad band magnitudes of the objects makes it unlikely that they are low redshift ( z @xmath30 0.31 ) galaxies with oxygen emission lines in the narrow filter .",
    "the most likely identification of the emission lines is ly@xmath0 at the same redshift as the q1205 - 30 lls absorber , and in what follows we shall assume this to be the case",
    ".    only one of the six emission line galaxies ( s9 ) would have been selected as an lbg in current ground based programmes .",
    "the remaining five are too faint in the broad bands ( see table 4 ) .",
    "the number of lbgs brighter than r(ab)=25.5 with redshifts between 3.0 and 3.5 selected from ground based surveys is 0.4@xmath210.07 galaxies arcmin@xmath5 ( steidel et al . 1996 ) , and we hence expect 11 in our 27.6 arcmin@xmath31 field . assuming that lbgs have redshifts uniformly distributed between 3.0 and 3.5 we would expect on average 0.4 lbgs within the redshift range @xmath32 corresponding to the width of the narrow filter . in the hubble deep field north",
    "the lf of lbgs has been extended to r(ab)=27 ( steidel et al .",
    "1999 ) . integrating",
    "this lf leads to an expected number of lbgs of about 0.3 galaxies arcmin@xmath5 within the redshift range @xmath32 or on average 9 in our 27.6 arcmin@xmath31 field ( see sect . 4.2 in fynbo et al .",
    "( 1999a ) for a discussion on the relation between the redshift density @xmath33 of dlas and the lf of lbgs ) .",
    "hu et al . ,",
    "1998 , have reported on detections of ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies by means of narrow band imaging and long slit spectroscopy in random fields with densities about 4 arcmin@xmath5 per unit redshift down to similar depths in observed flux as in our sample , but at somewhat higher redshifts .",
    "hence , narrow / broad band ly@xmath0 imaging indicate the existence of a significant population of high redshift galaxies that is not included in current ground based lbg samples and which is possibly identical to the faint lbgs detected by hst .",
    "those galaxies , which make up the faint end of the high redshift galaxy lf , have large ly@xmath0 equivalent widths and are about a factor of 10 more numerous than the bright lbgs of current ground based samples .",
    "this result is in good agreement with our earlier conclusion based on searches for dla galaxies ( mller & warren 1998 ; fynbo et al .",
    ", 1999a ) that there is a significant population of faint high redshift galaxies which , despite their very small hi absorption cross  section , make up most of the high redshift dla absorbers .",
    "total ly@xmath0 luminosities for s7s12 are in the range 3.39.5 @xmath3 10@xmath4 h@xmath5 erg s@xmath6 for @xmath7=1.0 and 1234 @xmath3 10@xmath4 h@xmath5 erg s@xmath6 for @xmath7=0 . using the kennicutt ( 1983 ) prescription sfr = l(h@xmath0)/1.12 @xmath3 10@xmath4 erg s@xmath6 and assuming l(ly@xmath0)/l(h@xmath0)=10 and negligible dust extinction , we find star formation rates in the range 0.2  0.8 h@xmath5 m@xmath8 yr@xmath6 for @xmath7=1.0 and 1.13.0 h@xmath5 m@xmath8 yr@xmath6 for @xmath7=0 .",
    "the large equivalent widths of the emission lines make strong dust obscuration unlikely .",
    "the star formation rates for r(ab)@xmath3425.5 lbgs as estimated from balmer and oii emission line strengths by pettini et al",
    ". , 1998 , fall in the range 20  270 m@xmath8 yr@xmath6 for @xmath7=0.2 and h=0.7 . for @xmath7=1.0",
    "this corresponds to 455h@xmath5 m@xmath8 yr@xmath6 .",
    "hence , the ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies have star formation rates about an order of magnitude lower than what is measured for the bright lbg population .",
    "nevertheless , since the population of ly@xmath0 emission line galaxies is much more common that the brighter lbg population , it is still an open question if the _ integrated _ sfr is dominated by the faint or the bright end of the high redshift galaxy lf .    as seen in fig .  [ field ] the faint galaxies",
    "are all located in a region north west of the qso .",
    "their projected impact parameters from q1205 - 30 range from 156 to 444 h@xmath6 kpc , and four of the six galaxies are found in a small region of projected size 100 @xmath3 100 h@xmath5 kpc@xmath31 . as for the compact group",
    "s1s2s3 associated with a z=2.81 dla absorber , this compact group of faint galaxies associated with a z=3.036 lls absorber is destined to merge on a short timescale ( navarro et al .",
    "1995 ; haehnelt et al .",
    "this , then , supports the suggestion ( warren & mller 1996 ; mller & warren 1998 ) that high redshift , high column density absorbers predominantly are proto  galactic sub  clumps in the process of early galaxy assembly , rather than fully formed large rotating disks .",
