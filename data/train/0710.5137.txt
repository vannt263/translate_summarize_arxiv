    "electronic systems in the mesoscopic regime are ideal testing - grounds for investigating the quantum - to - classical transition from a microscopic coherent world ( where quantum interference effects prevail ) to a macroscopic classical world  @xcite . on one hand , their size is intermediate between macroscopic and microscopic ( atomic ) systems , on the other hand , today s experimental control over their design and precision of measurement allows one to investigate them in regimes ranging from almost fully coherent to purely classical  @xcite",
    ". the extent to which quantum coherence is preserved in these systems is usually determined by the ratio @xmath7 of the dephasing time @xmath8 to some relevant classical time scale @xmath9 .",
    "for instance , @xmath9 can be the traversal time through one arm of a two - path interferometer  @xcite , or the average dwell time spent inside a quantum dot  @xcite . in a given experimental set - up ,",
    "@xmath8 can often be tuned from @xmath10 ( quantum coherent regime ) to @xmath11 ( purely classical regime ) by varying externally applied voltages or the temperature of the sample .",
    "coherent effects abound in mesoscopic physics , the most important of them being weak - localization , universal conductance fluctuations and aharonov - bohm interferences in transport , as well as persistent currents  @xcite .",
    "the disappearance of these effects as dephasing processes are turned on has raised lots of theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite interest .",
    "focusing on transport through ballistic systems , dephasing is usually investigated using mostly phenomenological models of dephasing  @xcite , the most successful of which are the voltage - probe and dephasing - lead models  @xcite . in these models ,",
    "a cavity is connected to two external , l ( left ) and r ( right ) transport leads , carrying @xmath12 and @xmath13 transport channels respectively .",
    "dephasing is modeled by connecting a third `` fictitious '' lead to the system , with a voltage set such that no current flows through it on average .",
    "electrons leaving the system through this third lead are thus re - injected at some later time , with a randomized phase ( and randomized momentum ) .",
    "these models of dephasing present the significant advantage that the standard scattering approach to transport can be applied as in fully coherent systems , once it is properly extended to account for the presence of the third lead .    using random matrix theory ( rmt )",

    "similarly , the dwell time through the cavity is given by @xmath27 .",
    "the dephasing and voltage probe models account for dephasing at the phenomenological level only , without reference to the microscopic processes leading to dephasing . at sufficiently low temperature",
    ", it is accepted that the dephasing arises dominantly from electronic interactions , which , in diffusive systems , can be well modeled by a classical noise potential  @xcite .",
    "remarkably enough , this approach reproduces the rmt results of eqs .   and with @xmath8 set by the noise power .",
    "these results are moreover quite robust in diffusive systems .",
    "they are essentially insensitive to most noise - spectrum details , and hold for various sources of noise such as electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions , or external microwave fields .",
    "for this reason it is often assumed that dephasing is system - independent , and exhibits a character of universality well described by the rmt of transport applied to the dephasing / voltage probe models  @xcite .      according to the bohigas - giannoni - schmit surmise  @xcite ,",
    "closed chaotic systems exhibit statistical properties of hermitian rmt  @xcite in the short wavelength limit .",
    "opening up the system , transport properties derive from the corresponding scattering matrix , which is determined by both the hamiltonian of the closed system and its coupling to external leads  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that for not too strong coupling , and when the hamiltonian matrix of the closed system belongs to one of the gaussian ensembles of random hermitian matrices , the corresponding scattering matrix is an element of one of the circular ensembles of unitary random matrices  @xcite .",
    "one thus expects that , in the semiclassical limit of large ratio @xmath28 of the system size to fermi wavelength , transport properties of quantum chaotic ballistic systems are well described by the rmt of transport .",
    "this surmise has recently been verified semiclassically  @xcite .",
    "the regime of validity of rmt is generally bounded by the existence of finite time scales , however , and it was noticed by aleiner and larkin that , while the dephasing time @xmath29 gives the long time cut - off for quantum interferences , a new _ ehrenfest time _",
    "scale appears in quantum chaotic system in the deep semiclassical limit , which determines the short - time onset of these interferences  @xcite .",
    "the ehrenfest time @xmath30 corresponds to the time it takes for the underlying chaotic classical dynamics to stretch an initially localized wavepacket to a macroscopic , classical length scale . in open cavities ,",
    "the latter can be either the system size @xmath31 or the width @xmath32 of the opening to the leads .",
    "accordingly , one can define the closed cavity , @xmath33 $ ] , and the open cavity ehrenfest time , @xmath34 $ ]  @xcite .",

    "interestingly enough , the deep semiclassical limit of finite @xmath30 sees the emergence of a quantitatively dissimilar behavior of weak - localization and quantum parametric conductance fluctuations , the latter exhibiting no @xmath30-dependence in the absence of dephasing  @xcite .",
    "these results are not captured by rmt , instead one has to rely on quasiclassical approaches  @xcite or semiclassical methods  @xcite to derive them .",

    "this suggested that dephasing retains a character of universality even in the deep semiclassical limit .",

    "we apply this formalism to a model of an open quantum dot coupled to a second , closed quantum dot .",
    "we present a detailed calculation of the drude conductance and the weak - localization correction , including coherent - backscattering , which explicitly preserves the unitarity of the @xmath45-matrix , and hence current conservation .",
