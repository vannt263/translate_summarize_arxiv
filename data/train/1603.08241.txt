    "all cosmic objects from stars to the clusters of galaxies are rotating .",
    "rotation should be an essential property of any theory for the origin of galaxies .",
    "rotation prevents celestial bodies from collapsing .",
    "if there were no rotation , intuitively it would seem like everything would start falling directly toward the nearest largest mass . as stated by whittaker in his lecture @xcite : `` rotation is a universal phenomenon ; the earth and all the other members of the solar system rotate on their axes , the satellites revolve round the planets , the planets revolve round the sun , and the sun himself is a member of the galaxy or milky way system which revolves in a very remarkable way . how did all these rotary motions come into being ? what secures their permanence or brings about their modifications ? and",
    "what part do they play in the system of the world ? '' .    here",
    "particular attention is paid to whittaker s question .",
    "although many attempts were made to explain how the rotation got started , there is no unanimity on this topic .",
    "weizscker @xcite , ozernoy and chernin @xcite , developed the scenario of primordial turbulences .",
    "now it is only of historical value because if the angular momentum of galaxies had originated by turbulence , their spins should be perpendicular to the main proto - structure plane @xcite which is not observed .",
    "also if the rotation of spiral galaxies were remained from the primordial turbulence , it would be dissipated by shocks at the epoch of recombinations @xcite .",
    "further possible process of explaining the origin of rotation is vector perturbation of the metric .",
    "one possible source for such perturbations is the cosmic strings but no convincing experimental verification of cosmic strings has been confirmed up to now @xcite .",
    "one may also follow the idea of hoyle and say that the origin of rotation would have come from angular momenta of its original neighbors . however , it is difficult to prove it in a theoretical treatment @xcite .    of particular interest",
    "is the idea of rotation of the whole universe .",
    "this idea was first expressed by g. gamow @xcite .",
    "soon after gamov s letter , gdel derived such a solution for einstein s field equations on his seventieth birthday .",
    "( for a brief history see @xcite ) .",
    "if we say that the universe is rotating as a whole we would have to define a rotation axis . a rotation axis would cause some problems , like violating a homogeneous and isotropic universe as proposed by the standard model of cosmology and also is in contrast with the cosmological microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) .",
    "gdel also admitted that his universe can not serve as a model of the universe we live in because it does not contain expansion .    although the attempts mentioned above are valued , whittaker s question is still unanswered .",
    "it is necessary to achieve a mechanism based on standard theories of physics i.e. quantum field theory and the standard model of cosmology for the origin of rotation which is consistent with the observational data .",
    "a possible scenario is that the universe make a phase transition from the standard cosmological solution to a rotating model and then to the standard cosmological solution .",
    "this phase transition can be caused by a scalar field .",
    "the overview @xcite consists of the list of references on cosmological models with rotation but perhaps the gdel space - time is the best known of them @xcite .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that a phase transition between the friedmann open metric and gdel can lead to a new cosmological scenario for the evolution of the universe , in which the present universe is originated from primordial gdel universe . the cosmological phase transition in gdel space  time using the zeta function method has been studied in @xcite and also the effective action of a scalar field in gdel space ",
    "time was obtained in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we adopt a scenario in which the universe experiences a phase transition from de - sitter to gdel space  time and then from gdel to de - sitter space  time .",
    "we show that such a double transition would induce rotation into the trajectory of initially non  rotating test particles .",
    "since in this scenario the universe lives in gdel phase for a small time , it has the benefit that the rotation is introduced without destroying other aspects of the cosmological model .",
    "although for simplicity , we studied here the phase transition from static de - sitter to gdel and then back to de - sitter space ",
    "time , the scenario is applicable to more realistic cases .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we derive the effective potential of a scalar field in de - sitter and gdel space  times in a suitable form for our scenario . then in section three , the geodesics of a test particle is investigated during the phase transition and the induced rotation is obtained .",
    "finally , using computer simulation , the local and global induced rotation for a congruence of particles is studied .",
    "let s start with a scalar field living on a curved background . comparing covariant expression for the components of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor of a perfect fluid and the energy",
    " momentum tensor of a scalar field makes it clear that a scalar field acts like a perfect fluid with an energy density and pressure given by @xmath0 @xmath1 in the minimum of potential , @xmath2 is negligible and @xmath3 provided that the field @xmath4 is spatially constant .",
    "these assumptions yield an equation of state of @xmath5 , thus @xmath6 acts as an effective cosmological constant . to consider the quantum effects we have to employ the method of the effective potential in curved space ",
    "times @xcite .",
    "given the action of a scalar field on a curved background @xmath7=\\int d^{4}x\\sqrt{-g}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi\\partial^{\\mu}\\phi - v(\\phi)\\right)\\ ] ] the expression of one - loop effective potential is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the one - loop effective action , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the spatial volume .",
    "the arbitrary length parameter @xmath12 is introduced for dimensional considerations and @xmath13 is the laplace operator defined with the background metric .    since the universe is in thermal equilibrium , computations should be performed in the framework of finite temperature quantum field theory hence we use the euclidean effective potential .",
    "it is important to notice that the wick rotation in curved space ",
    "time is a bit problematic .",
    "we can only adopt wick rotation for stationary space  times .",
    "also , for rotating metrics , more parameters than the time coordinate should be analytically continued .",
    "here we are looking for a situation in which the space ",
    "time metric changes from de - sitter to gdel and vice versa as a result of thermal phase transition of the scalar field .    in order to make the mentioned scenario working",
    ", we have to have three phases .",
    "first , @xmath14 acts like a positive cosmological constant which is much larger than the dust density ( @xmath15 ) leading to de - sitter space  time .",
    "second , @xmath14 plays the role of a negative cosmological constant and equal to @xmath16 to have gdel space  time .",
    "finally the scalar field should roll such that the universe arrives at de - sitter space ",
    "time again .",
    "a typical scenario of this process is shown in figure ( [ fig : 1 ] ) .        to continue , let s first briefly investigate the finite temperature one  loop potential of a scalar field in de - sitter and gdel backgrounds .",
    "although de - sitter solution of the einstein s equations is a non - stationary space ",
    "time , we restrict ourselves to the static chart to have an stationary metric in which the wick rotation can be applied . the euclidean line element of de - sitter space ",
    "time in the static coordinate patch is : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the spatial scale , and the periodic parameter @xmath22 ranges from @xmath23 to @xmath24@xcite . using the zeta - function regularization method , one can derive the effective potential as @xmath25\\ ] ] to be specific , we assume that the classical potential is : @xmath26 following the calculations of appendix a , the renormalized effective potential can be written in terms of dimension - less quantities as : @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29\\bigg\\ } \\label{vd}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "this potential has extrema at : @xmath35 and at the roots of the equation : @xmath36 @xmath37 note that if the above equation has no real root , the potential is a harmonic  type potential and otherwise it is in mexican hat shape .",
    "the regions of parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and the temperature @xmath40 that allows a mexican hat shape is plotted in figure ( [ fig : 2 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that during the cooling of the universe , there is a critical temperature that the scalar field experiences a phase transition as desired .",
    "this is plotted in figure ( [ fig : 3 ] ) , for some specific values of the parameters .     and",
    "@xmath41.,height=264 ]    at the temperature that the minimum of the mexican hat has depth equal to @xmath42 , the universe experiences gdel geometry and thus we have to evaluate the one  loop potential in gdel s background , as we do in the next subsection .",
    "gdel space - time is an exact solution of einstein s equations with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "the source for gdel geometry is a perfect fluid with a constant density @xmath43 and no pressure @xmath44 . in the cartesian",
    "coordinates the gdel line element is given by @xmath45 where the constant @xmath46 determines the angular momentum four - vector ( @xmath47 ) of the intrinsic rotation of the whole manifold .",

    "prime on the summation denotes that the term @xmath52 is omitted .",
    "@xmath53 is the modified bessel function and @xmath54 is the epstein zeta function @xmath55 @xmath56 in which @xmath57 . in the limit @xmath58 and @xmath59 ,",
    "the renormalized effective potential as a function of dimension - less quantities is given by @xmath60 \\label{vg}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 .",
    "the general shape of the on  loop effective potential in these limits is shown in figure ( [ fig : 4 ] ) .",
    ", @xmath62 , and @xmath63.,height=264 ]    now we have enough material to bring our desired scenario into act . starting from a de - sitter background ( with @xmath64 ) , after enough cooling of the universe via expansion , the universe reaches the critical temperature @xmath65 .",
    "this temperature is where @xmath66 .",
    "assuming @xmath67 is small , from the equation ( [ vd ] ) , one can see that the approximate relation for the critical temperature is : @xmath68 below this temperature , the scalar field do a phase transition to the mexican hat potential ( see figures ( [ fig : 1 ] ) and ( [ fig : 3 ] ) ) .",
    "the phase transition can be studied using the mean field approximation .",
    "it is a second order phase transition with the free energy given by @xmath69 and the order parameter @xmath70 . from equation ( [ vd ] ) we see that : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a constant and @xmath73 has a taylor expansion @xmath74 .",
    "the critical exponents can be simply obtained as : @xmath75 @xmath76 and the critical exponent of the specific heat is zero .",
    "the mean field can be seen from equation ( [ vd1 ] ) that is approximately @xmath77 . in order to have a gdel space ",
    "time , the depth of potential should be half the density of the matter .",
    "using equation ( [ vd ] ) , we have @xmath78 . since the space ",
    "time metric changes from de - sitter to gdel , the scalar field potential changes shape to figure ( [ fig : 4 ] ) .    in the gdel phase ,",
    "the scalar field rolls down the potential till @xmath79 . in order to not introduce any changes in the cosmological parameters , we set @xmath80 . using equation ( [ vg ] ) ,",
    "we see that the universe again goes to a de - sitter phase , after elapsing the time given by : @xmath81    writing anything in terms of the more physical parameters @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , and recovering @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 we have : @xmath88 it is important to note that since we assumed that the dust density is very smaller than the cosmological constant , the time that universe elapses in gdel phase is much smaller than the time scale of de - sitter space  time .    at this end , some notes on the horizon temperature is useful .",
    "the horizon temperature of de - sitter space is defined as @xmath89 . in our simple scenario",
    ", we assumed that the space  time after leaving the gdel phase , enters a de - sitter phase with the same cosmological constant as the first de - sitter space , and therefore the horizon temperature does not changes during the whole process .",
    "this is not an essential requirement for this model .",
    "one can assume that the cosmological constant in the first and final phases are different .",
    "this makes no essential changes in the results and thus we assumed here that no change in the horizon temperature is present .",
    "another thing that is important to note is that the critical temperature and the horizon temperature are not equal .",
    "for example , for the parameters given in figure ( [ fig : 3 ] ) , the shape change is at @xmath90 , or @xmath91 .",
    "therefore at the critical temperature , the horizon and the scalar field are not at thermal equilibrium .",
    "but as it is clear from ( [ fig : 3 ] ) , transition to a true vacuum of the mexican hat potential , brings these more closer to equilibrium .",
    "now we have a model in which the background goes through de - sitter to gdel and then to de - sitter space  times .",
    "this is a result of the phase transition and slow rolling of a scalar field .",
    "we are now ready to investigate the motion of test particles during these phase transitions .",
    "it is quite reasonable to expect that a particle with a non - rotating trajectory entering the first de - sitter phase , exits to the final de - sitter phase while it is rotating .",
    "this leads to an induced rotation which could be considered as the reason of universal rotation .    in order to see this , in what follows , we start from a particle moving radially and match its trajectory to the gdel s and then to de - sitter s geodesics . consider a massive particle which initiates at the point @xmath92 in the first de - sitter phase ( point number 1 in figure ( [ fig : 1 ] ) ) .",
    "the de - sitter static patch line element in the coordinates @xmath93 is given by : @xmath94 the four  velocity of the particle at point number 1 , is given by : @xmath95 where @xmath96 superscript means that the particle is in the first de - sitter phase .",
    "now the scalar field suddenly makes a phase transition to the point number 2 of figure ( [ fig : 1 ] ) , and thus the space ",
    "time metric becomes gdel metric . in order to find the initial condition of the particle",
    ", we have to match these phases .",
    "we do this by writing the above initial condition in the local inertial frame and then converting to the gdel s global coordinate system .",
    "to do so we need the tetrads of both space  times .",
    "de - sitter s tetrads are given by : @xmath97 and @xmath98    for gdel s space ",
    "time , it is better to write the line element in cylindrical coordinates @xmath99 : @xmath100\\ ] ] where @xmath101 .",
    "the following change of coordinates makes it more suitable for our purpose : @xmath102 the metric then would be : @xmath103 where @xmath104 .",
    "the tetrads of gdel s space  time in this coordinate system are then computed easily as : @xmath105 and @xmath106    now the velocity in local inertial frame of de - sitter space is : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the local radial velocity , and @xmath109",
    ". therefore the initial velocity of the particle in the gdel space - time is : @xmath110 during the slow roll of the scalar field from point number 2 to point number 3 of figure ( [ fig : 1 ] ) , the particle evolves according to the geodesics equation from @xmath111 to @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is given by equation ( [ roll ] ) .",
    "the trajectory can be derived from the geodesics equations of the gdel space  time : @xmath114 @xmath115 @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are constants .",
    "furthermore for massive particles , we have : @xmath119    applying the initial condition at the point @xmath120 , the constants a and b are simply obtained in terms of @xmath121 : @xmath122    finally from the relations ( [ eq2 ] ) , ( [ eq3 ] ) , and ( [ eq1a ] ) , one can obtain @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 as : @xmath126 @xmath127 @xmath128    during the field roll from point number 2 to the point number 3 of figure ( [ fig : 1 ] ) the velocity would be @xmath129 in principle @xmath130 can be obtained from equations ( [ eq4]),([eq5 ] ) and ( [ eqr5 ] ) , at least numerically .",
    "but since the time @xmath131 is small compared to the time scale of gdel metric ( note that @xmath132 ) , we can expand the relations around @xmath133 to obtain : @xmath134 this leads to the relation : @xmath135    matching the final velocity to the de - sitter space ",
    "time , we get the exit velocity of the particle as :    @xmath136    after some simple calculations , the final velocity of the test particle is obtained as : @xmath137    in order to see how much this particle is rotating , one can evaluate the vorticity : @xmath138 equation ( [ eq10 ] ) leads to : @xmath139 where @xmath140 .",
    "the rotation profile is plotted in figure ( [ fig : 5 ] )",
    ".        therefore such a sequence of phase transitions induce rotation in the motion of non  rotating particles .",
    "the value of this rotation depends on the position of the particle in the de - sitter space , its distance from the gdel s axis of symmetry , and its initial radial velocity but it is of order @xmath141 .    after investigating",
    "the induced rotation for a test particle , one could ask whether the mechanism works for a congruence of particles or not . in what follows we use numerical simulation to investigate the induced rotation of local and global congruence of particles .    in order to simulate the local induced rotation",
    ", we consider a uniform distribution of a large number ( in the order of @xmath142 ) of particles within @xmath143 and @xmath144 having a gaussian distribution in the initial velocity .",
    "figure ( [ fig : 6 ] ) shows the induced rotation at different values of @xmath143 for a local congruence of test particles .",
    "this shows that if the phase transition takes place , one have non  zero local induced rotation .    on the other hand , to investigate the situation for a global congruence , we divide the space into adjacent cells .",
    "each cell may or may not experience the phase transition according to the quantum tunneling probability .",
    "the symmetry axis of the gdel space is randomly may be any direction .",
    "the result of the simulation is shown in figure ( [ fig : 7 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the average global induced rotation is very close to zero .",
    "in fact for our simulation the average value of @xmath145 is @xmath146 with the standard deviation @xmath147 .",
    "this gives a value of @xmath148 for the global rotation .",
    "compared to the observational limit@xcite , @xmath149 , this is quite acceptable for our simple model .    as a result , although the local induced rotation is non  zero , the global induced rotation is below the limit of observational data .",
    "particles uniformly distributed in the region @xmath150 .",
    "the velocity distribution is assumed to be gaussian , i.e. @xmath151 is a gaussian of mean value @xmath152 and width @xmath153 .",

    "the velocity distribution is assumed to be gaussian , i.e. @xmath151 is a gaussian of mean value @xmath152 and width @xmath153 . the axis of rotation is randomly distributed between cells and the quantum probability of tunneling is considered.,height=377 ]",
    "here we provided a model based on quantum field theory and general relativity which may be a candidate for a possible explanation of the universal rotation .",
    "rotation is essential for the stability of celestial bodies and its origin is an important issue in cosmology .",
    "there are number of ways in which physicists have tried to justify how the rotation has been started in the universe , but non of them is the final solution .",
    "we considered a scalar field which may be the inflaton field and studied a cosmological phase transition between de - sitter and gdel space - times .",
    "we saw that it is quite possible to have a sequence of phase transitions from de - sitter to gdel and then again to de - sitter space  time .",
    "as the universe expands , it reaches a critical temperature in which the potential shows a negative valued minimum .",
    "if this happens at right time , this minimum which acts as a negative cosmological constant has the needed relation with the dust density leading to gdel space  time . as the space ",
    "time transits from de - sitter to gdel , the potential changes shape and then the field slow rolls to the new minimum which acts like a positive cosmological constant . the space ",
    "time again would be de - sitter .",
    "after investigation of the possibility of desired phase transitions , we studied the motion of test particles during these phase transitions .",
    "we observed that a non - rotating particle , leaves the gdel space ",
    "time with an induced rotation .",
    "the induced rotation is a function of the distance from the symmetry axis of gdel s space  time and the initial radial velocity of the particle , and is of order of @xmath156 .",
    "simulation shows that for a local congruence of particles we have a non  zero induced rotation , while the global rotation approximately averages to zero .",
    "it should be noted that one should not worry about the exotic behaviors of gdel s space  time , because the closed time - like loops are non - geodesics paths in gdel s space  time .",
    "this model suggests that such a scenario may be possible in the framework of the standard model of cosmology .",
    "the model may be extended to other space  times and fields ( like vector , spinor and tensor fields ) to get closer to an exact enough expression for the universal rotation .",
