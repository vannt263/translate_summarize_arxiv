    "in 1985 constantin , lax , and majda introduced a one - dimensional equation which models the phenomenon of vortex - stretching in a three - dimensional incompressible fluid .",
    "they established finite - time singularity formation in their model .",
    "following in their footsteps , de gregorio introduced a one - dimensional equation which models the effect of _ both _ transport and vortex stretching .",
    "de gregorio , aided by some numerical simulations , then conjectured that his introduction of velocity transport leads to global regularity .",
    "thereafter , okamoto , sakajo , and wunsch introduced a continuum of models which give different `` weights '' to the vortex stretching and transport terms by introducing a real parameter @xmath7 in front of the transport term .",
    "the full model then became : @xmath8 @xmath9 with the constantin - lax - majda and de gregorio models being the cases @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "they conjectured that when the transport term is strictly weaker than the vortex stretching term @xmath12 , finite time singularities would occur and that there would be global regularity when the transport term is as strong or stronger than the vortex stretching term @xmath13 .",
    "this was previously unconfirmed except in the case @xmath14 where the transport term and vortex stretching term are actually working together toward singularity formation .",
    "all of this revolves around the notion of the stabilizing effect of transport and the destabilizing effect of vortex stretching . in this work",
    ", we will prove singularity formation in the range @xmath15 for some @xmath16 from initially smooth profiles . to this end",
    ", we first prove the existence of self - similar finite - time singularity formation from smooth data for the constantin - lax - majda equation .",
    "then we use a `` soft '' continuation argument to prove singularity formation when @xmath17 is small .",
    "one of the interesting features of this construction is that the solutions , while becoming singular in finite time , remain uniformly bounded in a norm which is strictly stronger than those predicted by the scaling of the equation and available conservation laws  a phenomenon which is conjectured to happen when @xmath18 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . finally , using merely hlder continuous self - similar solutions for the constantin - lax - majda equation , we establish singularity formation for de - gregorio s model ( and for all @xmath19 ) in classes of hlder continuous solutions .",
    "furthermore , for each @xmath20 we establish that such self - similar solutions lead to singularities in finite time which keep the velocity field bounded in the @xmath21 norm near the singular point though the velocity s @xmath22 norm is becoming infinite .",
    "this relates to the @xmath23 conjecture for the cordoba - cordoba - fontelos model .",
    "hence , it seems that the de gregorio model exhibits two types of behavior for strong solutions : first there are `` somewhat smooth '' solutions for which there is singularity formation in finite time , then there are `` very smooth '' solutions and it is conjectured that these remain smooth for all time .",
    "such a phenomenon is also neither captured by the scaling of the equation nor conservation of any critical quantity .",
    "our interest in these models is two - fold : first , they give a simplified setting to understand the complex interaction between transport and vortex stretching .",
    "second , as the authors have shown in @xcite , these models actually serve as the equations for the evolution of scale - invariant solutions to the sqg equation and similar active scalar systems , which are locally well - posed in function spaces containing scale - invariant solutions ( with some symmetry assumption on the initial data ) .      the main difference between the two - dimensional incompressible euler equation and its three - dimensional counterpart is the presence of the so - called vortex - stretching term in three dimensions .",
    "the two - dimensional incompressible euler equation can be written as : @xmath24 @xmath25 while the three - dimensional euler equation can be written as : @xmath26 @xmath27 in two dimensions , @xmath28 is a scalar quantity and is advected by a velocity vector field which it induces . in three dimensions",
    ", @xmath28 is a vector quantity .",
    "the term @xmath29 is a transport term and , since @xmath30 is divergence free , it can not cause any growth of the vorticity .",
    "the term @xmath31 is called the vortex stretching term and can lead to amplification of the vorticity . as is shown in the classical work of beale , kato , and majda @xcite , finite - time singularity formation for strong solutions of the incompressible euler equation happens if and only if the sup - norm of the vorticity becomes infinite .",
    "the absence of vortex stretching in two dimensions allows the two dimensional euler equation to enjoy infinitely many coercive conserved quantities , notably all @xmath32 norms of the vorticity for @xmath33 .",
    "the presence of vortex stretching makes the three - dimensional euler equation unstable with respect to all @xmath32 norms which were conserved in the two dimensional case and leads to point - wise exponential or double - exponential growth of the vorticity in time ( see , for example , @xcite,@xcite ) . despite the clear destabilizing properties of the vortex stretching term",
    ", the global regularity question of the three - dimensional euler equation is wide open . in our view",
    ", there are three principle reasons why the regularity question is difficult :    1 .   the quadratic and non - local nature of the vortex stretching term .",
    "2 .   the presence of _ both _ the vortex stretching and the transport terms . 3 .   the 3d euler equation is a _ system _ rather than a scalar equation .",
    "the importance of the second difficulty is discussed in great detail in @xcite . in view of these many difficulties ,",
    "experts in the field have devised simpler model equations that share some of the above properties for which more can be proven .",
    "the first attempt to derive a simplified 1d equation which models the effects of vortex stretching seems to be that of constantin , lax , and majda @xcite where they wished to consider a non - linear evolution equation whose non - linearity is quadratic and non - local just like the vortex stretching term @xmath31 . considering the exact relation between @xmath30 and @xmath28 given by @xmath34 ,",
    "one sees that @xmath35 is just a matrix of singular integral operators applied to @xmath28 .",
    "hence , one has the relation : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is some matrix of singular integrals . to extract a simple model from this ,",
    "constantin , lax , and majda dropped the transport term , made the 3d euler system into a one - dimensional scalar equation , and replaced @xmath37 by the hilbert transform .",
    "this led to : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the hilbert transform .",
    "this equation can then be solved _",
    "exactly _ using some special properties of the hilbert transform  namely , the tricomi identity ( see appendix a.1 ) . the reader should notice that in our above breakdown of the difficulties associated with the 3d euler equation , the constantin - lax - majda equation only takes into account the first of the difficulties : the vortex stretching term is quadratic and non - local .",
    "one of the unfavorable properties of the reduction of constantin , lax , and majda is that it does not behave well with the presence of diffusion .",
    "in fact , as schochet has shown @xcite , the viscous clm equation can experience finite time singularity formation _ before",
    "_ its inviscid counterpart even for small viscosity .",
    "more than this , the model does not take into account the effects of the transport term . to fix this problem ,",
    "de gregorio ( @xcite,@xcite ) introduced a variant of the clm equation that is much closer to the 3d euler equation , which even has a large set of spatially periodic steady states as the 3d euler equation does .",
    "de gregorio s model is : @xmath40 @xmath41 notice that de gregorio kept the same vortex stretching term but added a transport term as well .",
    "it is important to note that any function of the form @xmath42 is a stationary solution to de - gregorio s equation while there are no non - trivial stationary states to the clm equation would have to satisfy : @xmath43 and @xmath44 which would imply that @xmath45 .",
    "when @xmath28 has non - zero mean , consider @xmath46 with @xmath47 mean - zero and so @xmath48 and @xmath49 notice that if @xmath50 is @xmath51 somewhere , @xmath52 is also @xmath51 there .",
    "in other regions , we could have @xmath53 but since @xmath52 must be mean - zero and @xmath52 only takes on the values @xmath54 and @xmath51 , @xmath55 this rules out the existence of any non - constant periodic @xmath56 stationary solution of the clm equation . ] .",
    "moreover , if one considers the clm equation with data @xmath57 , the solution becomes singular in finite time  developing a singularity like @xmath58 near @xmath59 as @xmath60 ( see next section ) , but if one considers the de gregorio equation with the same data , there is no singularity formation ( @xmath61 is stationary ! ) .",
    "this already indicates that the transport term can have a stabilizing effect .",
    "numerical simulations done by de gregorio @xcite , okamoto , sakajo , and wunsch @xcite , and others indicate , in fact , that singularity formation formation for de gregorio s model is impossible from smooth data . in this work , we prove that singularity formation for de gregorio s model is possible in spaces of hlder - continuous functions .",
    "this seems to be the first rigorous large - data result for de gregorio s model .      in the spirit of constantin ,",
    "lax , and majda s idea of getting a simple 1d model of the 3d euler equation , cordoba , cordoba , and fontelos found a 1d model for the so - called surface quasi - geostrophic ( sqg ) equation .",
    "recall the surface quasi - geostrophic equation : @xmath63 @xmath64 with @xmath65 where @xmath66 are the riesz transforms on @xmath67 .",
    "cordoba , cordoba , and fontelos modeled this by the following 1d equation : @xmath68 @xmath69 upon differentiating this equation and setting @xmath70 we get : @xmath71 @xmath72 which is the same as de gregorio s model except that the vortex stretching term has the opposite sign .",
    "cordoba , cordoba , and fontelos proved in @xcite finite time singularity formation for this model , again , using some special properties of the hilbert transform . unlike the case with the constantin - lax - majda model , they were not able to solve the equation exactly but were able to prove that certain kinds of smooth initial data can not have global - in - time solutions by proving that @xmath73 for some positive quantity @xmath74 which satisfies @xmath75 and some constant @xmath76 .",
    "thereafter , authors tried to push this blow - up result to prove that @xmath77 actually develops a shock at the time of blow - up .",
    "however , numerics indicate that a different phenomenon than shock formation is taking place . in fact",
    ", it seems that @xmath77 remains uniformly bounded in @xmath23 for some unapparent reason . proving that this is actually the case would be very interesting since it indicates that simply by choosing the velocity field @xmath30 to be @xmath78 rather than @xmath77 , a phenomenon which `` breaks the scaling '' of the equation takes place . in other words , the dynamics of the equation",
    "would then not be dictated by clearly conserved quantities or scaling , since the strongest known conserved quantity is the @xmath79 norm of @xmath77 and the scaling critical quantity is the @xmath80 norm .",
    "the @xmath23 conjecture is then simply to prove that solutions to the cordoba - cordoba - fontelos model remain uniformly bounded in @xmath23 up to the time of blow - up ( see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "we close by mentioning a recent work by hoang and radosz @xcite which rigorously established cusp formation in a non - local model , which is a slight variant of the ccf model .",
    "the culmination of all of these developments is the introduction of one continuum of models under which one can place all of those previously stated .",
    "this was done by okamoto , sakajo , and wunsch @xcite .",
    "they introduced the following continuum of models :    @xmath81 @xmath82 with @xmath19 a parameter .",
    "the case @xmath18 corresponds to the cordoba - cordoba - fontelos model , the case @xmath10 corresponds to the constantin - lax - majda model , and the case @xmath11 corresponds to de gregorio s model . while it may seem that different values of @xmath7 can lead to totally different phenomena which would bring into question the efficacy of such a continuum",
    ", we will argue in this work that there seems to be a deeper connection between all of these models as well as the questions mentioned above : particularly the global regularity question for de gregorio s model and the @xmath23 conjecture for the cordoba - cordoba - fontelos model .",
    "this connection is most visible when one considers self - similar solutions .",
    "returning to the issue of finite time singularities , it is intuitively clear that when @xmath83 , the transport effect would work together with the stretching effect to develop a singularity . indeed , castro and crdoba @xcite managed to prove that there is finite time blow up of smooth solutions in the case of negative @xmath7 .",
    "the question of finite time singularity / global regularity was left open for @xmath84 , and one of our main results shows that when @xmath7 is small and @xmath85 data is considered , the blow up indeed occurs , and it may occur even in a self - similar way . moreover , for each @xmath86 there",
    "exists initial data in @xmath87 for some @xmath88 sufficiently small for @xmath7 large , which leads to a finite - time singularity .",
    "it is interesting to note that both the de gregorio and okamoto - sakajo - wunsch systems have direct connections with the sqg equation discussed in the above .",
    "indeed , in the work of castro and crdoba @xcite , it was observed that with the so - called _ stagnation point similitude _",
    "ansatz @xmath89 if @xmath90 solves the de gregorio system , then one obtains a solution to the sqg equation .",
    "moreover , in our recent work @xcite , we have established that one can uniquely solve the sqg equation ( locally in time ) with the _ radial homogeneity _",
    "ansatz , which is in polar coordinates @xmath91 and then @xmath92 on the circle solves a system which is essentially the okamoto - sakajo - wunsch system with @xmath93 , up to a very smooth term in the relation connecting the scalar @xmath94 with the velocity @xmath30 .",
    "the importance of this ansatz ( as opposed to the stagnation point ansatz ) is that singularity formation from smooth data for radially homogeneous solutions ( which have infinite energy ) implies finite - time singularity formation from compactly supported ( finite energy ) data in a suitable local well - posedness class , as shown in @xcite .      in this paper",
    ", we consider the okamoto - sakajo - wunsch systems in the following form : @xmath95 where @xmath19 is a parameter and @xmath96 and @xmath97 are functions of one spatial variable @xmath98 .",
    "our first main result shows that when @xmath17 is small , there exists a smooth initial data which blows up in finite time in a self - similar manner .",
    "this is to say that    [ thm : main1 ] there exists some absolute constant @xmath99 such that for @xmath100 , there is an odd initial data @xmath101 , depending analytically on @xmath7 , which blows up in finite time in a self - similar manner .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath100 , there exists some @xmath102 depending analytically on @xmath7 and with @xmath103 , such that the unique local solution of with initial data @xmath104 in @xmath105 is given by @xmath106 which blows up precisely at @xmath107 .",
    "even though we have chosen to work with a finite regularity space @xmath108 , a straightforward modification of our arguments actually gives that the profile @xmath109 belongs to any @xmath110 for @xmath111 and in particular to the space of analytic functions .",
    "[ thm : main1prime ] let @xmath112 be the self - similar solutions constructed in theorem [ thm : main1 ] . then , @xmath113 remains uniformly smooth up to the blow - up time away from @xmath59 .",

    "the main idea of our work is that if the transport term is `` weaker '' than the vortex stretching term , then singularities will form in finite time .",
    "the weakening of the transport term , in our setting , can happen in two ways :    1 .   by putting a small parameter in front of the transport term .",
    "2 .   by taking merely @xmath3 vorticity with @xmath155 small . for the 2d euler equation on @xmath156 .",

    "we illustrate these ideas using an explicitly solvable toy model .",
