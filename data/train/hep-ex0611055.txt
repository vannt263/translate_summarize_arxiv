    "an iron flux - return located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath10 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) .",
    "charged tracks are reconstructed in the cdc and their impact parameters are precisely determined using the svd . charged hardon identification is accomplished based on the combined information from the acc , tof and cdc @xmath11 systems .",
    "electron identification is based on a combination of @xmath11 measurements , the acc response and information about the shape , energy deposit and position of the associated shower in the ecl .",
    "muons are identified by requiring an association between klm hits and an extrapolated track .",
    "photons are reconstructed in the ecl as showers that are not associated with charged tracks .",
    "in the standard model ( sm ) , the purely leptonic decay @xmath12  @xcite proceeds via annihilation of @xmath13 and @xmath14 quarks into a @xmath15 boson ( fig .",
