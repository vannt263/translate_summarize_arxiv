    "the role of spatial inhomogeneities and their interplay with particle interactions is summarized in detail for zero - range processes in @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite for further references ) , and in this paper we focus on spatially homogeneous processes .    while the stationary behaviour of condensing systems with factorized distributions has been understood in great detail also on a rigorous level @xcite",

    "the fastest is the usual hydrodynamic time scale of order @xmath3 for asymmetric and order @xmath4 for one - dimensional symmetric systems of size @xmath3 on which non - stationary density profiles evolve in time , which has been studied heuristically in @xcite with partial rigorous results in @xcite . within that scale ,",
    "the excess mass in supercritical systems has accumulated in isolated cluster sites which form the condensed phase .",
    "these can not be included in a hydrodynamic description via density fields , but rather act as boundary reservoirs scattered at random positions in the system .",
    "the sites exchange particles on a slower time scale identified as @xmath4 ( asymmetric ) and @xmath5 ( 1d symmetric ) in @xcite for @xmath2 , with related recent rigorous progress in @xcite .",

    "the main novelty is a direct description of the size - biased version of the single - site dynamics , which provides an interesting tool to analyze the coarsening dynamics without any finite size effects .",

    "the dynamics of the process is then conveniently characterized by the infinitesimal generator @xmath24 describing the expected change of suitable test functions @xmath25 ( see e.g. @xcite for details ) .",

    "we do not give this in detail and use the generator ( [ eq : genzrp ] ) instead , since it is more convenient for our purposes .",

    "this phenomenon has been very well understood on the level of stationary distributions and the equivalence of ensembles in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of this condensation phenomenon remain an area of active research interest with recent rigorous results in @xcite , and also in the context of related population models @xcite .",
    "the zero - range process with rates ( [ rates ] ) exhibits particularly interesting dynamics starting from homogeneous initial conditions with a particle density @xmath55 , which have first been described in @xcite for @xmath45 .",
    "the stages of the dynamics can be summarized as follows ( cf .  also figure [ fig : fig1dynamic ] ) :    1 .",
    "nucleation regime : the density decreases locally to @xmath53 and the resulting excess mass concentrates into cluster sites .",
    "outside clusters on a so - called bulk sites , the system relaxes to its steady state distribution @xmath56 .",
    "coarsening regime : the clusters exchange particles through the bulk , leading to a decreasing number of cluster sites of increasing size .",

    "the scale is @xmath58 .",
    "saturation regime : on finite systems , eventually there is only a single cluster site left which contains all excess particles and forms the condensate , which changes position on an even longer time scale .",
    "our main interest in this paper is the coarsening regime and we will explain in the following how to effectively describe the dynamics .",
    "we focus our presentation on the complete graph for simplicity , i.e. @xmath59 for all @xmath60 with finite lattices @xmath11 of size @xmath3 , and comment on the influence of other homogeneous geometries in the conclusion .",
    "consider a zero - range process with rates ( [ rates ] ) on a finite lattice of size @xmath3 with @xmath61 particles , initially distributed uniformly at random .",
    "we denote the set of all possible configurations of this process by @xmath62 . to describe the coarsening dynamics , we will study dynamics of two kinds of empirical processes :    @xmath63    @xmath64    the first process counts the fraction of lattice sites with occupation number @xmath65 , while the second one counts the fraction of particles which are on sites with occupation number @xmath65 . note that the condensed phase has only a small , time - dependent weight in the first process which tends to the stationary value @xmath66 with only one condensate site . in the second process , however , the weight of the condensed phase is roughly constant in time and given by the mass fraction @xmath67 due to the different weighting , where @xmath68 is the particle density .",

    "both processes are normalized , i.e. @xmath69 for all @xmath70 .",
    "also , they can be interpreted as distributions of single site occupations .",
    "the second process is a size - biased version of the first one , and both are related via @xmath71    in figure [ fig : fkpk ] , we illustrate the behaviour of these processes when averaged over @xmath72 realizations of the zero - range dynamics .",
    "we see that the coarsening process transports mass from small occupation numbers to form a stationary bump around occupation numbers @xmath54 , two such bumps are shown for densities @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the distribution within the condensed phase at any given time is characterized by an intermediate bump in the distribution which is broadening over time with its maximum moving to the right .",
    "building on the analysis in @xcite , we will investigate the scaling behaviour of this bump . on a finite lattice",
    ", the scaling behaviour only occurs in a finite time window before the system reaches stationarity",
    ". however , ideally , we are interested in an infinite lattice where the condensed phase distribution keeps broadening and moving to larger occupation numbers forever .",
    "both processes in figure [ fig : fkpk ] are shown on very different scales since the condensed phase has much larger weight under @xmath75 than under @xmath76 , as explained above .",
    "the bulk part of the distribution concentrates on the left and is not shown in full since we focus our attention on the condensed phase .",
    "while the size - biased process @xmath75 is more suitable to study the coarsening dynamics , we start our analysis with the process @xmath76 describing the single site dynamics of the process since this is simpler to analyze .",
    "this has already been studied in @xcite for @xmath45 , so we keep the presentation short and show numerical results only for the size - biased process later in section 4 . applying the generator ( [ eq : genzrp ] ) for the complete graph case with @xmath78 to the test function @xmath76",

    "the bulk part of the distribution converges i.e. @xmath108 and in fact is very close to the stationary marginal @xmath50 even for finite times as is confirmed later in figure [ fig : bd sub ] .",
    "the probability fraction of this part is @xmath109 and the expectation converges to @xmath53 corresponding to the mass contained in the bulk . the condensed part therefore contains the rest of the mass @xmath110 according to ( [ masscon ] ) , but only a vanishing probability of order @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , typical occupation numbers in this phase scale as @xmath112 , which justifies the intermediate scale chosen in the formal definition ( [ ansatz ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we assume that @xmath113 takes the scaling form @xmath114 which we adapted from @xcite to @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "one of the prefactors",
    "@xmath111 corresponds to the vanishing probability of the condensed phase , the other one is a volume element to get a density @xmath115 . in terms of the scaling function @xmath115 , the volume fraction of the condensed phase",
    "is given by @xmath116 which fixes the normalization @xmath117 .",
    "also , the mass in the condensed phase is @xmath118 which is consistent with previous assumptions and imposes a second constraint on @xmath115 .",
    "since the bulk phase is close to the stationary marginal @xmath50 and @xmath115 changes with time only on scale @xmath111 , we have @xmath119 as we will see later that @xmath111 decays as a power law with @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the condensed part fulfills the same master equation as ( [ eq : df / dt ] ) @xmath120 to write this as a closed equation for @xmath115 , we need to find an expression for the time - dependent birth rate @xmath121 under the phase separated state .",

    "for @xmath129 we have to keep a small time - dependent prefactor for @xmath130 to regularize the solutions .",

    "neither equation ( [ eq : gamma_f ] ) nor ( [ eq : gamma1_f ] ) can be solved explicitly , but numerical solutions presented in the next section agree well with simulation data .",
    "analogously to ( [ fk ] ) , we can act with the generator ( [ eq : genzrp ] ) on the test function @xmath132 to get @xmath133 the first and last term can again be written as @xmath134 and @xmath135 , respectively . for the two middle terms",
    ", we use the same approximation as before .",
    "dropping terms of order @xmath81 we get @xmath136 for all @xmath137 with the convention @xmath138 .",
    "note that by definition @xmath139 since this is the size - biased version of the configuration .",
    "taking expectations and using the same notation as before , with @xmath140 we get for @xmath141 @xmath142 where we used ( [ gmean ] ) and that @xmath143 . for @xmath144",
    ", we have @xmath145 again , this is the master equation of a birth death chain on the state space @xmath146 with additional diagonal terms corresponding to long - range jumps from occupation numbers @xmath144 to @xmath141 , and killing or cloning events which are not probability conserving .",
    "we have @xmath147 where we denote by @xmath148 the positive part of the expression .",
    "note that the total cloning rate of chains with @xmath144 exactly equals the killing rate of chains with @xmath141 , so in total the probability is conserved @xmath149 note also that the average jump rate is now given by @xmath150 using ( [ rel ] ) .",
    "if @xmath151 , all cloning and killing rates vanish and the only new part of the dynamics are long range jumps from @xmath65 to @xmath152 .",
    "this leads to subcritical dynamics , and it is easy to see that now the size - biased version @xmath153\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of the marginals of stationary measures of the zero - range process ( [ eq : marg ] ) are stationary for the birth death chain with master equation ( [ eq : diffp_k ] ) for all @xmath154 $ ] .",
    "note also that there is no obvious second conservation law for the size - biased chains related to the density as was the case for @xmath155 .",
    "however , @xmath52 now explicitly enters the master equation of the process through the above expression for @xmath92 in ( [ gmeanp ] ) which selects the stationary distribution for different @xmath156 $ ] .",
    "any long jumps can be interpreted as sites with @xmath157 receiving a particle in the original zero - range processes . for",
    "supercritical systems with @xmath158 , chains with small occupation number @xmath65 perform jumps to @xmath152 since @xmath159 , while chains that made it to large occupation numbers do not but have a positive rate for cloning .",
    "this mechanism generates bimodal distributions with a condensed and a bulk phase by @xmath160 and @xmath161 , analogously to ( [ ansatz ] ) .",
    "using the same scaling ansatz as ( [ ansatz ] ) where we replace the asymptotic bulk part with a size - biased version , we note that @xmath162 implies the same relation for the condensate part of the distribution , i.e. @xmath163 . this leads to @xmath164 for the mass fraction in the condensed phase which does not vanish and is constant in time .",
    "in particular , for the scaling of @xmath165 , we have @xmath166 therefore , it is sufficient to solve the equations ( [ eq : gamma_f ] ) or ( [ eq : gamma1_f ] ) to get theoretical predictions for the scaling behaviour of @xmath165 .",
    "simulation of the birth death chains related to @xmath167 and @xmath168 can only be done approximately using a large ensemble of parallel realizations , due to the non - linearity of the master equations . to determine the time evolution , it is necessary to compute the time - dependent expectation @xmath92 , which can be approximated by an ensemble average .",
    "we denote the birth death chain related to @xmath167 by @xmath169 and let @xmath170 be different realizations with @xmath171 in an ensemble of size @xmath172 . with master equation ( [ eq : df / dt ] ) , we then use the approximation @xmath173 we show in appendix b that the total density in the ensemble average @xmath174 is a martingale , i.e. future expectations are equal to its present value . as opposed to zero - range processes where the total number of particles is strictly conserved , this is still a fluctuating quantity .",
    "furthermore , the ensemble has an absorbing state at @xmath175 for all @xmath176 , since the approximated birth rate in this state is @xmath177 .",
    "this leads to the fact that by fluctuations all ensembles get absorbed in state @xmath178 , and one can show that the average time to absorption scales like @xmath172 ( see appendix b ) .",
    "this implies that the coarsening process can only be truthfully represented by the ensemble in a finite time window , which is similar to the restriction in the zero - range process due to the approach to stationarity .",
    "this represents a strong limitation for numerical analysis and is illustrated in figure [ fig : sigma ] further below .",
    "a further disadvantage is that in both processes , the chains related to @xmath167 and the original zero - range process , the condensed phase only covers a vanishing fraction of the ensemble or lattice , which leads to poor statistics as is illustrated in figure [ fig : uh(u ) ] below .",
    "we can overcome these problems by simulating an ensemble of size - biased birth death chains @xmath179 with master equation ( [ eq : diffp_k ] ) .",
    "the ensemble average @xmath180 has to be modified as explained in the previous section since @xmath181 now represents a size - biased single site process .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath182 chains , the density @xmath52 explicitly enters the dynamics as a parameter . in addition",
    ", we use the ensemble to implement killing and cloning events as follows : since the killing rate of chains with occupation number @xmath141 is equal to the total cloning rate for chains with @xmath144 , everytime we clone a chain , we kill a chain with @xmath141 to keep the ensemble size @xmath172 fixed",
    ". there may be instances where no @xmath141 chain exists in the ensemble at the time of cloning , but it turns out that for large enough ensemble sizes this happens very rarely ( for our parameter values not more than @xmath183 times in simulations up to times of order @xmath184 ) , and we can ignore such events .",
    "they could easily be taken into account by allowing the ensemble size to grow in time , but this does not make any difference to numerical results .      in the following we present our results comparing numerical solutions of the scaling equations with simulation results from the size - biased birth death chain with master equation ( [ eq : diffp_k ] ) , which we denote by @xmath185 where we have @xmath186 .",
    "as a first test , we confirm that for subcritical densities @xmath187 , @xmath188 eventually converges to a size - biased stationary distribution @xmath189 as given in the previous section .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : bd sub ] , where the tail distribution of the process @xmath188 converges to a size - biased version @xmath190 ( [ sbmgn ] ) of the stationary marginal of the zero - range process .",
    "this is independent of the actual initial condition @xmath191 , the asymptotic density @xmath52 is determined by the parameter @xmath52 in ( [ gmeanp ] ) and ( [ eq : g_average ] ) as shown in figure [ fig : bd sub ] ( right ) . for supercritical @xmath102 ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath188 phase separates , where with probability @xmath192 it takes small values corresponding to the bulk sites of the zero - range process .",
    "this part of the distribution again converges to @xmath193 with @xmath194 which has now a sub - exponential tail , as is illustrated in figure [ fig : bd sup ] ( right ) . with probability @xmath195 ,",
    "the chain takes large values corresponding to the condensed phase .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : bd sup ] ( left ) where we plot the tail @xmath196 $ ] and see a plateau emerging at @xmath197 . in figure [ fig : gmean ] , we compare the ensemble average for @xmath92 under the ensemble of birth death chains with the spatial average in the zero - range process , and find good agreement .",
    "the fluctuations around the mean are of similar size as well since we choose @xmath172 and @xmath3 of similar size , even though much higher values of @xmath172 can be treated numerically without problems .",
    "note that a single ensemble of @xmath198 chains gives the same quality of data as an average of @xmath72 realizations of the zero - range process of size @xmath3 .",
    "the data also compare well with the theoretical prediction obtained in ( [ eq : ansatz_gmean ] ) with a fitted constant @xmath199 depending on the parameter @xmath8 .",
    "agreement of the ensemble averages for the expected jump rate @xmath92 under zero - range dynamics ( zrp ) and the birth death chain @xmath200 ( [ eq : g_average ] ) ( bd ) , in comparison with the theoretical prediction ( [ eq : ansatz_gmean ] ) with fitted parameters @xmath201 .",

    "we have studied the coarsening dynamics towards condensation for zero - range processes with jump rates of the form ( [ rates ] ) via the site and size - biased empirical processes , which are non - linear birth death chains with master equations ( [ eq : df / dt ] ) and ( [ eq : diffp_k ] ) , respectively .",
    "we could close these equations with a standard mean field assumption and on a complete graph it should be possible to justify this rigorously which is left as future work .",
    "the coarsening time scale @xmath217 for @xmath218 $ ] is derived from a phase separated ansatz for the solution of the closed equation , analogously to results in @xcite for @xmath2 .",
    "the main novelty is the use of the size - biased birth death chain providing a strong tool to analyze the coarsening dynamics without finite size effects and significantly improved statistics .",
    "this approach is generic and can be adapted to other condensing particle systems such as the inclusion process , which is current work in progress . +",
    "our results have been presented for the complete graph case . in other translation invariant geometries , such as one - dimensional lattices with periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the time scales can depend on local transport properties on the lattice , in particular on the symmetry of the dynamics .",
    "asymmetric dynamics behave in general as the complete graph independently of the dimension .",
    "the scaling can be affected by the particular behaviour of first passage times and probabilities dominating the transport process of mass between cluster sites .",
    "this is slowing down coarsening for symmetric systems in one dimension with an expected scaling of @xmath219 in analogy with results in @xcite , but in higher dimensions we expect the same scaling as for asymmetric systems and the complete graph , with logarithmic corrections in two dimensions .",
    "mathematically this means that the mean field approximation to derive the master equations ( [ eq : df / dt ] ) and ( [ eq : diffp_k ] ) is not justified in certain symmetric systems and has to be adapted .",
    "in particular , the replacement of @xmath220 in ( [ canocurrent ] ) in 1d symmetric systems has to be corrected since the presence of a cluster at site @xmath18 modifies the occupation number at sites @xmath221 and @xmath222 , resulting in a decrease of the birth rates in the birth death chain .",

    "now assume that @xmath230 is the typical separation between cluster sites , and the system is locally stationary in between clusters .",
    "the main assumption is that the phase separated state in the limit of diverging system size is given by @xmath231 i.e. the canonical , super - critical state with time - dependent system size corresponding to the typical distance between clusters .",
