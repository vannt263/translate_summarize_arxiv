    "the use of the term freak wave was first introduced to the scientific community by draper  @xcite .",
    "freak waves are also called rogue waves , giant waves , monster waves , killer waves , extreme waves , abnormal waves , huge waves , super waves , or gigantic waves , which are formed due to the interaction of the nonlinearity and dispersion in the wave propagation .",
    "nowadays , there is no unique definite for the rogue waves , but , a wave called a rogue wave means that the wave height @xmath1 ( i.e. , distance from trough to crest ) or the crest height @xmath2 ( i.e. , distance from mean sea level to crest ) exceeds a certain threshold related to the sea state  @xcite . generally speaking ,",
    "the common criteria of rogue waves is that @xmath3 or @xmath4 , where @xmath5 stands for the significant wave height  @xcite .    rogue waves , as a special type of solitary waves , have drawn much attention in some fields of nonlinear science such as oceanics  @xcite , nonlinear optics  @xcite , bose - einstein condensations  @xcite , atmospherics  @xcite , and even finance  @xcite .",
    "the first - order rational solution of the self - focusing nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation was first found by peregrine  @xcite to describe the rogue wave phenomenon , which was known as peregrine soliton ( or peregrine breather ) and could be regarded as a limiting case of the ma breather when the breathing period approaches to infinity  @xcite or of the akhmediev breather as the spatial period tends to infinity  @xcite .",
    "more recently , multi - rogue wave solutions of the self - focusing nls equation were also found on basis of the deformed darboux transformation in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , nonautonomous rogue wave solutions have also been found for the generalized nls equations with variable coefficients in one - dimensional space  @xcite and in three - dimensional spaces  @xcite based on the similarity analysis idea .",
    "the term ` rogue ( freak ) waves ' was called ` rogons ( freakons ) ' if they reappeared virtually unaffected in size or shape shortly after their interactions  @xcite . in nonlinear optics , optical rogue waves",
    "have been observed in two different experiments , based on two nonlinear optical models , i.e. , the higher - order nls equation  @xcite and the nls equation  @xcite , respectively .",
    "moreover , they have verified that optical rogue waves reveal an approach to exert maximal control over a nonlinear system with minimal effort and can be used to produce highly stable supercontinuum  @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the celebrated black - scholes ( alias as black - scholes - merton ) option pricing model  @xcite + 12 ^ 2 s^2 + rs - rc(s , t)=0 , was presented , based on the the geometric brownian motion ( i.e. the stochastic differential equation ) @xmath6 satisfied by the stock ( asset ) price @xmath7 and the it@xmath8 lemma  @xcite , where @xmath9 is the value of european call option on the asset price @xmath7 at time @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the instantaneous mean return , @xmath12 is the stock volatility , @xmath13 is a wiener process , and @xmath14 is the risk - free interest rate . this model has drawn much attention and also opens the new area of study in financial mathematics or financial engineering .",
    "the black - scholes model can be widely used for valuing the pricing of european - style options , but it can not be used for valuing other exotic types of options such as american options or asian options as it can not incorporate exercise features or any path dependencies  @xcite .",
    "more recently , based on the modern adaptive markets hypothesis due to lo  @xcite , elliott wave market theory  @xcite , and quantum neural computation approach  @xcite , ivancevic presented a novel nonlinear option pricing model ( called the _ ivancevic option pricing model _ )  @xcite [ nls ] i=-12 -|(s , t)|^2(s , t ) , i= in order to satisfy efficient and behavioral markets , and their essential nonlinear complexity , where @xmath15 denotes the _ option - price wave function _ , the dispersion frequency coefficient @xmath12 is the volatility ( which can be either a constant or stochastic process itself ) , the landau coefficient @xmath16 represents the adaptive market potential .",
    "some periodic wave solutions of eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) have been obtained  @xcite .",
    "recently , we first presented the two financial rogue wave solutions of the ivancevic option pricing model ( [ nls ] ) and illustrated their dynamics  @xcite , which may explain real financial crisis / storms ( e.g. , 1997 asian financial crisis / storm and the current global financial crisis / storm ) .",
    "in addition , for the aim of including a controlled stochastic volatility into the adaptive ivancevic option pricing model ( [ nls ] ) , the adaptive , symmetrically coupled , volatility and option pricing model ( with interest rate @xmath14 and hebbian learning rate @xmath17 ) has been presented , which represents a bidirectional spatio - temporal associative memory  @xcite . in the following",
    ", we would like to study the financial rogue waves of the coupled nonlinear model .",
    "by introducing a controlled stochastic volatility into the adaptive - wave model ( [ nls ] ) , ivancevic also presented the coupled nonlinear volatility and option pricing model in the form  @xcite [ nlsc ] [ nlsc1 ] & & i=-12 -(r , w)(s , t ) , + [ nlsc2 ] & & i=-12 -(r , w)(s , t),i= to generate a leverage effect , i.e. , stock volatility is ( negatively ) correlated to stock returns  @xcite , where eqs .",
    "( [ nlsc1 ] ) and ( [ nlsc2 ] ) are called the volatility model and option pricing model , respectively , @xmath15 denotes the _ option pricing wave function _",
    ", playing the role of a nonlinear coefficient in the volatility model ( [ nlsc1 ] ) , @xmath18 denotes the _ volatility wave function _ , standing for a nonlinear coefficient in the option pricing model ( [ nlsc2 ] ) .",
    "both processes thus evolve in a common self - organizing market heat potential , so they effectively represent an adaptively controlled brownian behavior of a hypothetical financial market , @xmath19 with the adaptation equation @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "( [ nlsc1 ] ) and ( [ nlsc2 ] ) without an embedded @xmath0learning ( i.e. , for constant @xmath21-the interest rate ) , possessed the solitary wave solutions  @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge , the analytical financial rogue waves of eqs .",

    "here , based on the similarity analysis and the approach developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , we show that the coupled nonlinear volatility and option pricing model ( [ nlsc1 ] ) and ( [ nlsc2 ] ) without an embedded @xmath0learning also admits the financial multi - rogon ( rogue wave ) solutions , which may be used to describe the possible formation mechanisms for rogue wave phenomenon in financial markets . in the following ,",
