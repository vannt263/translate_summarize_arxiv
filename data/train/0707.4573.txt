    "a complete understanding of the dynamics of plastic deformation in low temperature , or athermal , amorphous systems remains a major theoretical challenge in statistical and condensed matter physics .",
    "the response of these systems to the application of external driving forces exhibits some universal features like a transition from jamming to flow at the yield stress , orientational memory effects of recent deformation and strain localization @xcite . in this work we focus on the spatiotemporal patterns associated with the transition from jamming to flow at the onset of plastic yielding , in the framework of the recently developed athermal shear transformation zones ( stz ) theory of amorphous systems @xcite .",
    "this transition is controlled by the applied stress . for stresses below a material dependent threshold , the yield stress ,",
    "these systems exhibit elastic deformation as well as transient plastic flow that vanishes at a finite time .",
    "the resulting state is `` jammed '' in the sense that it carries a finite stress without flowing . on the other hand , for stresses that exceed the yield stress , these systems exhibit persistent plastic flow , implying some remarkable `` unjamming '' ( or yielding ) transition at the yield stress .",
    "the main difficulty in developing a theory of amorphous plasticity , that among other things should predict plastic yielding at a finite yield stress , is that the identity and characteristics of the microstructural objects that `` carry '' plastic deformation in amorphous ( disordered ) systems remain quite elusive .",
    "however , a growing body of experimental and simulational evidence seems to point towards a unifying picture in which low temperature amorphous plasticity involves stress driven configurational rearrangements of localized regions composed of a small collection of the relevant elementary entities ( e.g. particles , molecules , grains , colloids , bubbles ) @xcite .",
    "the existence of such a unifying picture , which is independent of the elementary entities and their microscopic interactions , is fully consistent with the existence of universal features mentioned above .    in line with this accumulating evidence ,",
    "the athermal shear - transformation - zones ( stz ) theory of amorphous plasticity views stz as localized groups of particles that are more susceptible to shearing transformation under stress than their surroundings . upon surpassing a local threshold",
    "an stz can undergo a finite irreversible shear in a given direction .",
    "once transformed , due to a local redistribution of stresses , an stz resists further deformation in that direction , but is particulary sensitive to reverse shear deformation if the local applied stress changes sign .",
    "therefore , an stz is conceived as a two - state system that can transform between its internal states depending on the magnitude and direction of the local stress .",
    "in addition , the stress redistribution that accompanies an stz transition can induce the creation and annihilation of other stz at a rate proportional to the local energy dissipation ( recall that thermal fluctuations are assumed to be absent or negligible ) .",
    "the minimal two - state assumption , along with the deformation driven creation and annihilation of stz , provides a mechanism for retaining and losing orientational memory of previous deformation and is sufficient to capture the transition from jamming to flow at a finite yield stress .",
    "we choose to study the spatiotemporal characteristics of the unjamming transition using stz theory for two major reasons .",
    "first , the existence of the transition is described in this theory , as will be explained in detail below , by an exchange of dynamic stability in the equations of motion for an internal state field .",
    "we find such a description superior to theoretical approaches that simply postulate the existence of a threshold stress above which plastic flow persists @xcite .",
    "more generally , we find an approach that aims at identifying proper order parameters , or internal state fields , and writing equations of motion for them based on microscopic insights as well as symmetries and conservation laws very appealing @xcite .",
    "second , recent work has shown that the stz equations capture a variety of phenomena observed in computer simulations and laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "most relevant for our purposes here are the results reported in @xcite . in @xcite , the two - state nature of stz has been observed directly in bubble - raft experiments and two - dimensional foam simulations .",
    "it was found that groups of bubbles can make transitions , the so - called t1 events that are realizations of stz transitions in foam , between two states if the direction of the applied force is reversed shortly after an event occurs .",
    "however , if the force is not reversed until after other events have occurred nearby , then the orientational memory is lost , implying that an stz is annihilated . in @xcite",
    "the stz equations were shown to agree quantitatively with transient shear reversal behavior of a granular flow in a taylor - couette cell .",
    "this result provides the first direct support to an equation that will be central in the analysis to follow .",
    "we proceed by introducing the relevant mean - field stz equations in sect .",
    "[ stz ] , where we also discuss the existence of the transition from jamming to flow at a finite yield stress and the physics behind it . in sect .",
    "[ fronts ] we focus on the spatiotemporal characteristics of the unjamming transition .",
    "we show that there exist propagating front solutions if the equations are modified to include effects beyond mean - field as well as an intrinsic lengthscale .",
    "section [ sum ] offers some concluding remarks .",
    "consider a two - dimensional athermal amorphous system under the application of a pure shear stress @xmath0 .",
    "the two states of an stz are oriented along the principal axes x ( the direction of the force ) and y ( the perpendicular direction ) , and denoted by `` @xmath1 '' .",
    "the number densities of stz in the `` @xmath1 '' states are denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "the configurational disorder of the system is characterized by an effective disorder temperature @xmath3 that is assumed to govern the total density of stz , with @xmath4 being the steady state density of stz under persistent deformation .",
    "@xmath3 was shown very recently to play an important role in the deformation dynamics of amorphous solids @xcite ; however , its dynamics in the present context are not of prime interest and will not be discussed .",
    "the internal state fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in addition to the applied stress @xmath0 , determine the macroscopic plastic rate of deformation @xmath5 according to @xcite @xmath6 here @xmath7 is a material - specific parameter with the dimensions of area .",
    "@xmath8 is the basic time scale and @xmath9 are the rates for forward and backward transitions respectively .",
    "the athermal condition implies that @xmath10 vanishes for @xmath11 , i.e. there are no transitions in the direction opposite to the direction of the applied force @xcite .",
    "( [ dplav ] ) simply states that the macroscopic plastic rate of deformation @xmath5 results from stz transitions between their two internal states , depending on the driving force through @xmath10 and on the population of stz in each of the two states .",
    "( [ ndot2 ] ) are master equations for the population densities @xmath2 themselves .",
    "the first two terms on the right hand side describes the number conserving process in which stz change their state from `` + '' to `` - '' or vice versa .",
    "the third term on the right hand side is a coupling term that accounts for interactions between stz . as mention above , the stress redistribution that accompanies an stz transition",
    "can induce the creation and annihilation of other stz .",
    "this is a crucial aspect of the theory .",
    "the rate of stz creation @xmath12 , which is a positive definite scalar , is assumed to be proportional to the rate of plastic dissipation @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "for low temperature we obtain @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a material - specific parameter of stress dimension , to be shown below to be equal the yield stress .",
    "@xmath15 has an interesting physical meaning : it quantifies how much of the dissipated energy is invested in creating new stz . when it is large , only a small amount of the dissipated energy is invested in creating new stz ( available for irreversible transitions ) and vice versa .",
    "this interpretation immediately suggests that @xmath15 is related to the yield stress ; see @xcite for a discussion of this issue from an entropic point of view .",
    "we proceed by setting the total stz density to its steady state value , @xmath16 and by defining an orientational order parameter @xmath17 ( which is generally a tensor , see @xcite ) as @xmath18 this internal state field represents the bias of the stz populations between the @xmath1 states . with these choices",
    "we can rewrite eqs .",

    "( [ eq : dpl0])-([eq : m0 ] ) were directly applied to predict transient granular flow in experiments of shear reversal in a taylor - couette cell .",
    "the theory was shown to agree well with the experimental data , encouraging us to further study it in the present context .",
    "the first issue to be discussed is the stable steady state solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : m0 ] ) .",
    "it has two stationary solutions :    1 .   a jammed state with @xmath22 ( depending on the sign of @xmath0 ) , where all the stz are either in the `` + '' or the `` - '' state respectively , and @xmath23 in eq . ( [ eq : dpl0 ] ) , 2 .   a flowing state with @xmath24 and @xmath25 in eq . ( [ eq : dpl0 ] ) .",
    "these two solutions coincide at @xmath26 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the jammed state is dynamically stable for @xmath27 , while the flowing state is dynamically stable for @xmath28 .",
    "an exchange of stability occurs at @xmath29 , which indeed shows explicitly that @xmath15 is the yield stress .",
    "the fact that @xmath15 was introduced in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) as a proportionality constant between the rate of stz creation @xmath12 and the rate of energy dissipation @xmath13 is yet another point of divergence with respect to standard approaches .",
    "in stz theory the yield stress @xmath15 , as was explained before , is intimately related to the ability of the material to create new stz as a result of plastic dissipation , i.e. stz transitions in nearby locations @xcite . in this interpretation ,",
    "a material can yield , i.e. support steady plastic flow , if enough stz per unit time are created due to other stz transitions .",
    "if this rate is not sufficiently large , then existing stz are exhausted in transitions at a given direction and not enough new stz are available for additional transitions that are needed for attaining a steady state . for a given applied stress , whether or not @xmath12 is large enough ,",
    "is determined by @xmath15 .",
    "this is the essence of yielding in stz theory .    as a result , the onset of plastic yielding at a finite threshold",
    "is a _ dynamic _ phenomenon manifested as an exchange of stability of the bistable field @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "these results have similar implications for strain - rate @xmath30 controlled experiments ( complementary to the stress - controlled experiments discussed up to now ) where the existence of a finite yield stress means that a steady state with a finite stress is obtained in the limit @xmath31 .",
    "the existence of a dynamic threshold is a signature of an underlying bistability ( or multistability ) , which is a natural way to get a finite dissipation at a vanishing strain - rate .",
    "note that all these conclusions are entirely independent of the material function @xmath32 .",
    "we thus propose that the bistability of the orientational order parameter @xmath17 is a crucial feature of the theory of amorphous plasticity .",
    "we now proceed to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of this jamming - unjamming transition .",
    "we substitute eq .",
    "( [ eq : dpl0 ] ) into eq . ( [ eq : m0 ] ) to obtain @xmath33 where we have assumed @xmath34 .",
    "consider then an experiment in which the stress is ramped to a constant value smaller than the yield stress ( i.e. @xmath35 ) .",
    "the system is assumed to be initially undeformed and isotropic such that the orientational order parameter satisfies @xmath36 .",
    "( [ eq : dpl0 ] ) and ( [ meq ] ) then predict that sub - yield plastic deformation occurs as @xmath17 relaxes to the jamming fixed - point @xmath37 on a typical time scale @xmath38 @xmath39 during which @xmath40 .",
    "the jamming time scale @xmath38 diverges as @xmath41 , i.e. approaching the yield stress from below , and as @xmath42 .",
    "the latter divergence is a result of the athermal condition , leading to @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "therefore , eq . ( [ relax ] ) predicts that jamming is obtained by progressively slower creep - like sub - yield deformation as @xmath0 approaches either 0 or 1 .",
    "moreover , it provides a way to measure the phenomenological function @xmath32 in the range where the jamming time is experimentally ( or simulationally ) accessible .",
    "suppose now that @xmath44 is @xmath45 , but not very close to unity such that the system becomes jammed on a realistic time scale ; then suppose that after jamming the applied stress is ramped again to a value above the yield stress , i.e. @xmath46 . the system is now in the jammed state , @xmath37 , that is unstable for @xmath46 .",
    "in these situations we generally expect fluctuations to propagate as fronts , converting an unstable state into a stable one .",
    "therefore , we are looking for translational invariant solutions of the form @xmath47 ; here we assume that the x - dimension is much larger than the y - dimension and that the front propagates from left to right .",
    "our task now is to solve eq .",
    "( [ meq ] ) for this ansatz , with the boundary conditions @xmath48 the first boundary condition corresponds to the flowing state left behind the front , while the second one corresponds to the jammed state ahead of it .",
    "a solution can be readily obtained , yielding    @xmath49}{\\displaystyle 1-\\left(\\frac{s_y } { s}-1 \\right)\\exp\\left[{\\frac{-2 { { \\mathcal{c}}}(s)(s / s_y-1)(x - ut)}{\\tau_0 u}}\\right]}\\ .\\ ] ]    this seems to be a propagating front solution in which a plastically deforming region , @xmath50 , invades a jammed region , @xmath51 .    however , eq . ( [ m_front ] ) is not a unique solution of the problem since it is valid for _ any _ velocity @xmath52 .",
    "more importantly , a velocity @xmath52 can not be selected by eq .",
    "( [ meq ] ) _ in principle _ since in the absence of an intrinsic lengthscale a velocity can not be _ dimensionally _ constructed .",
    "therefore , if we aim at describing the spatiotemporal patterns that accompany the onset of plastic flow , we can not avoid addressing the fundamental problem of missing a lengthscale in our theory .",
    "in fact , two lengthscales are already implied within our theoretical framework ; a finite stz density implies a typical distance between stz , which can be thought of as a microstructural correlation length .",
    "this lengthscale might be relevant as different stz can interact via the stress and displacement fluctuations generated when an stz transforms between its internal states .",
    "an evidence for the existence of such a lengthscale was given , for example , in @xcite ; it can be identified with the typical size of areas of quasi - crystal - like short - range order of @xcite or with the typical size of regions free of liquid - like defects of @xcite .",
    "the range in which these interactions can affect stz transitions also implies a lengthscale , possibly larger than the previous one , that is determined by a combined effect of the magnitude of the stress fluctuation , its range and the distribution of stz transition thresholds .",
    "this lengthscale characterizes the scale in which the probability of finding a sufficiently large stress perturbation ( that can overcome the local transition threshold ) is not exponentially small .",
    "therefore , we should consider _ nonlocal _ stress fluctuations that can induce stz transitions at different locations where stz already exist and are close to their transition threshold .",
    "this effect was stressed by several authors @xcite and was assumed to be the origin of the cascades of rearrangements observed in athermal quasi - static simulations @xcite . with this physical intuition in mind",
    ", we should extend the homogeneous and local mean - field theory to include some inhomogeneous and nonlocal effects .    in summary",
    ", our theory should incorporate nonlocal terms that account for the following physical effects : ( i ) the stress and displacement fluctuations that are generated by stz transitions , ( ii ) the joint spatial probability distribution function of stz that includes a correlation length , ( iii ) the stz transition thresholds distribution . therefore , we add to the left hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ dplav])-([ndot2 ] ) terms that are weighted integrals over existing terms that include the transition rates @xmath53 ; these new terms represent that idea that stz transitions from `` + '' states to `` - '' states ( or vice versa ) at a given location result in a properly weighted change in the rate of transitions at different locations . rearranging the modified equations we arrive at the following equation for @xmath54    @xmath55\\left[1- \\frac{s~m(x , t)}{s_y } \\right]+ 2~{{\\mathcal{c}}}(s ) \\left[1-\\frac{s~m(x , t)}{s_y } \\right]\\!\\ !",

    "[ m_modified ] ) , whose dimension is @xmath57 , represents the physics of stz correlations and interactions discussed above .",
    "the fact that it is a one - dimensional function of x alone already incorporates several approximations .",
    "first , there is some evidence that stz transitions generate quadrupolar elastic fields @xcite . here",
    "this anisotropic structure is neglected due to the assumption that the y - dimension is much smaller than the x - dimension .",
    "second , the kernel @xmath58 might include some time dependence that accounts , for example , for the wave nature of the stress and displacement fluctuations .",
    "we assume that this time - dependence can be integrated out without affecting the basic physics we are trying to describe . in choosing a specific functional form for the kernel @xmath56 we do not want to make any definite claim as to whether the incorporated lengthscale is a short - distance correlation length or a longer - distance cutoff scale discussed above , but to stress that our theoretical considerations _ entails the existence of a lengthscale_. both physical possibilities share the feature that the immobile stz interact via nonlocal stress fluctuations which can be schematically described by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the characteristic lengthscale and @xmath61 is the amplitude .",
    "note that we do not consider here very long - range kernels , i.e. with power - law tails , as we believe that the stz transition thresholds distribution limits the range in which stress fluctuations can induce stz transitions , as explained above .",
