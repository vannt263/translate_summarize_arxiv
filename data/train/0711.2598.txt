    ", binary atomic mixtures display a rich spectrum of quantum phases @xcite .",
    "such mixtures offer a means of forming ultracold heteronuclear molecules via photoassociation @xcite or feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "this in turn facilitates the creation of dipolar quantum gases @xcite and may provide an alternative approach to quantum information processing @xcite . on the technical side , species with unfavourable elastic to inelastic collision ratios , _ _",
    "e.g.__@xmath6k @xcite , may be cooled via elastic collisions with a second evaporatively cooled species .",
    "this method of sympathetic cooling has proved essential for cooling fermionic quantum gases to degeneracy @xcite , avoiding the restriction imposed by the suppression of s - wave collisions in single - species fermionic gases due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "bosons have been used to sympathetically cool fermions to degeneracy in several experiments @xcite-@xcite , permitting the study of mixtures in which the component species obey different quantum statistics .",
    "more recently binary bosonic mixtures of @xmath7rb-@xmath1rb @xcite , @xmath1rb - cs @xcite , and @xmath1rb-@xmath6k @xcite have attracted experimental attention .",
    "the combination of @xmath1rb and @xmath0cs offers particularly interesting prospects for experiments on quantum degenerate mixtures .",
    "@xmath1rb ( hereafter denoted rb ) is the most commonly condensed alkali species due to its favourable ratio of elastic to inelastic collisions . in contrast",
    ", strong inelastic losses in cs make it difficult to condense in a magnetic trap @xcite , and use of the @xmath8 state in combination with several stages of optical trapping were required to achieve quantum degeneracy @xcite .",
    "the rb scattering length is essentially independent of magnetic field , with only narrow feshbach resonances being present at accessible magnetic fields @xcite . for cs , a rich feshbach structure containing both narrow and broad resonances",
    "has already been exploited to produce cold molecular samples of dimers @xcite and efimov trimers @xcite and to precisely tune the scattering length around a broad zero - crossing @xcite .",
    "unlike some mixtures of alkali metals ( particularly those containing li ) , the magnetic moment - to - mass ratios for cs and rb atoms in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 states ( respectively ) are very similar , differing by less than 2@xmath11 for magnetic fields below @xmath12gauss .",
    "this ratio determines the acceleration of an atom due to a spatially varying applied magnetic field .",
    "hence , the very similar ratios for rb and cs mean that their oscillation frequencies in a harmonic magnetic trap differ by just 1@xmath11 over this field range .",
    "the displacements of the rb and cs clouds due to gravity ( ` gravitational sag ' ) are thus nearly identical .",
    "this leads to good spatial overlap of the clouds even at sub - microkelvin temperatures in a weak magnetic trap , making rb an attractive species with which to sympathetically cool cs .",
    "intriguingly , sympathetic cooling of cs with rb may offer a route to quantum degeneracy in magnetically - trapped cs , particularly if the magnetic trap is combined with an optical ` dimple ' potential @xcite . using a magnetic trap as the reservoir for loading this dimple rather than a large volume optical dipole trap @xcite",

    "dichroic mirrors are also used to couple both wavelengths into the fibres which transmit light for imaging and optical pumping .",
    "light for the rb and cs science mots is coupled into separate fibres for each wavelength .",
    "the pyramid mot provides a compact , robust two species atom source .",
    "the pyramid is constructed in two steps .",
    "firstly , two rectangular mirrors are mounted at 90 degrees to each other to form a ` v ' shaped trough . into this trough , two prisms",
    "are then mounted so as to close off the two ends of the trough .",
    "the four optics then form an open square based pyramid with a small ( @xmath21 ) opening at the apex .",
    "the face of each optic that points into the pyramid volume has a high reflection coating .",
    "the base of the pyramid is @xmath22 .",
    "the gap at the apex of the pyramid is aligned with the differential pumping tube leading into the uhv region of the vacuum system .",
    "light from the pyramid mot fibre ( @xmath23  mw of cooling and @xmath24  mw of repumping power at both wavelengths ) passes through a single achromatic @xmath25/4 plate and is collimated ( 1/@xmath26 radius = 20.4(4 )  mm ) before entering the vacuum chamber . aligning the circularly polarized pyramid mot beam onto the mirror assembly produces three orthogonal pairs of beams with the polarizations of a standard six - beam mot , as described in @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field gradient required for the pyramid mot is produced by a pair of water - cooled circular coils operated in the anti - helmholtz configuration and wound directly onto the vacuum system .",
    "additional coils provide a bias field , allowing the position of the magnetic field zero to be adjusted . when the zero - field point is located directly in front of the pyramid apex , the pyramid mot acts as a cold atom source for the science mot .",
    "atoms in the cold atomic beam generated by the pyramid mot are captured in two six - beam science mots . in the horizontal plane",
    "there are eight beams ( four per species ) , the intensity , alignment and polarisation of which can all be independently adjusted .",
    "the 780  nm and 852  nm beams in this plane are separated by @xmath27 . in the vertical direction",
    "the 780  nm and 852  nm light is aligned along a common beam path .",
    "all of the beams contain both cooling and repumping light .",
    "having independent adjustment in the horizontal plane means that each single - species mot can be independently optimised without affecting the performance of the mot for the other species .",
    "light from the rb and cs science mot fibres is collimated to a 1/@xmath26 radius of 10.9(1 )  mm .",
    "the beams are subsequently truncated by passing through 20  mm square polarizing beamsplitter cubes .",
    "a pair of anti - helmholtz coils mounted on a framework outside the science cell ( figure [ layout](b ) and ( c ) ) provides the magnetic field gradient .",
    "the experiment uses an ioffe - pritchard type ` baseball ' trap to generate 3d confinement with a controllable , non - zero bias field .",
    "the baseball consists of nine windings of kapton - coated square copper tubing ( outer diameter 3.175  mm with a 2.00  mm round hole down the centre ) .",
    "this coil alone produces a radial gradient of 1.087(4 ) gcm@xmath14a@xmath14 , an axial curvature of 0.154(2 ) g@xmath29a@xmath14 , and a bias field of 0.3410(3 ) ga@xmath14 . additional bias and cancellation coils ( nine and three turns , respectively , of tubing with an outer diameter of 4  mm and an inner diameter of 2.75  mm ) in the helmholtz configuration are used to either enhance or cancel the bias field produced by the baseball .",
    "vertical bias coils will be used in future experiments on optically trapped atoms in combination with a levitation field gradient produced by the mot coils .",
    "figures [ layout](b ) and [ layout](c ) show the arrangement of the coils .",
    "both fluorescence detection and absorption imaging are used to probe the atomic mixture .",
    "fluorescence from the mot is focused using a single lens and directed onto separate photodiodes for rb and cs light using a dichroic mirror .",
    "the dichroic reflects 852 nm light and transmits 780 nm light . a small amount ( 1.2(2)@xmath11 ) of 780 nm light",
    "is reflected onto the photodiode monitoring the cs fluorescence .",
    "this residual rb fluorescence signal is subtracted from the cs signal .",
    "absorption imaging provides spatial information about the atoms in both the mot and the magnetic trap .",
    "it is also used to calibrate the fluorescence detection .",
    "the cs and rb clouds are imaged onto a frame transfer ccd camera ( andor ixon 885 ) .",
    "for the mot measurements we use the camera in the standard imaging mode and image only a single species in any one experimental run . however , when imaging the mixture following release from the magnetic trap , we operate the camera in ` fast kinetics ' mode .",
    "this allows us to record separate images of the rb and cs clouds in a single experimental sequence , whilst still using the entire @xmath30 active area of the ccd for each image . in this mode",
    "the charge accumulated in the active ccd during the imaging of the first species is subsequently shifted into a second masked ccd .",
    "the vertical shift speed is 1.916  @xmath31s per row of pixels , leading to a minimum delay of just 1.92  ms when all 1000 rows of pixels are used .",
    "the active ccd is then exposed again and an image of the second species is recorded .",
    "both images are then read into a computer for processing .",
    "the two - image fast kinetics sequence is performed three times to obtain the usual set of three images ( absorption , probe only , and background ) for each species .",
    "the total time required is typically @xmath24  s , limited by the readout speed of the camera .",
    "the gradient and detunings of the single - species pyramid mots were optimised in order to maximise the loading rate of the science mot .",
    "this was done by monitoring the fluorescence of atoms captured in the science mot during the first 10  s of loading . for",
    "cs , the maximum science mot loading rate of 1.3(3)@xmath3210@xmath33 atoms  s@xmath14 was achieved for a pyramid magnetic field gradient of 8.5(1 ) gcm@xmath14 and a pyramid mot laser detuning of @xmath34 .",
    "the maximum loading rate for rb was 1.8(3 ) @xmath35 atoms  s@xmath14 , at the same gradient and a detuning of @xmath36 ( see table 1 ) . here , @xmath37  mhz ( @xmath38  mhz ) is the natural linewidth for cs ( rb ) , while @xmath39 is @xmath40 the laser detuning in mhz .",
    "these optimum settings showed only a weak dependence on the second mot parameters in the vicinity of _ their _ optimum settings . the atomic flux and therefore the science mot loading rate are strongly dependent on the dispenser current which sets the vapour pressure in the pyramid chamber .",
    "increasing the dispenser current above its usual operating value of 3a led to a much increased atomic flux , but would potentially degrade the vacuum in the uhv region over time . at 4a , for example , the science mot loading rate is increased by more than an order of magnitude and is then comparable to the rates demonstrated previously for a similar rb - cs cold atomic beam source @xcite .",
    "when the two - species pyramid mot is operated as a cold atom source , the continuous transfer of trapped atoms into the beam severely limits the density of the atom clouds .",
    "consequently , interspecies cold collisions play little role in the loss of atoms from the pyramid mot .",
    "this was confirmed by observing that the presence of the second species in the pyramid mot had no detectable effect on the loading rate of the first species in the science mot .

    "figure [ pushbeam](a ) shows the fluorescence of the rb and cs mots during loading with and without the rb mot displaced .",
    "the rb mot is allowed to load to approximately 50@xmath11 of its maximum single - species level before the cs mot loading is turned on at @xmath96  s. with the push beam off , the cs mot loading is strongly suppressed , and the rb mot begins to decay . when the experiment is repeated with the push beam on , the rb mot loading proceeds unimpeded , and the cs mot reaches @xmath97 of its single - species level before the rb and cs clouds begin to overlap , and interspecies inelastic collisions prevent further increase in the cs atom number . if necessary , the overlap could be reduced further by displacing the cs mot as well . using the displaced mot technique ,",
    "we have created two - species rb - cs mots containing a total of more than @xmath98 atoms .",
    "performance of the displaced double mot .",
    "( a ) the cs mot is switched on after 40  s of loading rb alone . without the push beam ( black line ) , atoms are lost from the rb mot due to light assisted interspecies inelastic collisions , and loading of the cs mot is greatly impaired . turning the push beam on ( grey line ) displaces the rb mot from the cs mot loading region , limiting losses due to interspecies collisions .",
    "absorption images of magnetically trapped rb clouds loaded from unperturbed ( b ) and displaced ( c ) mots are also shown .",
    "cross sections of the clouds in the vertical direction show increases in optical depth and size with the push beam present .",
    "similar images of cs clouds without ( d ) and with ( e ) the rb mot displaced show even more significant improvement .",
    "all images were obtained with the second species present in the mot .",
    "images are displayed on a common optical depth scale of 0 - 3 except for the unperturbed cs cloud , which is on a 0 - 1 scale .",
    "the cross sections are shown on a common 0 - 3.5 optical depth scale . ]      at the end of the mot loading phase , a standard sequence is used to load the atoms into the magnetic trap .",
    "a 30ms compressed mot ( cmot ) phase and a 15ms optical molasses phase are employed to compress and further cool the atomic clouds .",
    "the position of the trapped clouds is adjusted to be located at the centre of the magnetic trap by applying an appropriate bias field during the cmot phase . following the optical molasses ,",
    "the atoms are optically pumped into the @xmath4 and @xmath99 states of cs and rb respectively , with efficiencies of @xmath100 for both species .",
    "the push beam is switched off immediately before the start of the cmot phase , so that the two trapped atomic clouds become well overlapped prior to loading the magnetic trap .",
    "the short duration of the magnetic trap loading phase , however , means that there are no detectable losses due to interspecies light assisted collisions even though the clouds are now well overlapped .",
    "we load the atoms into the magnetic trap by simultaneously switching on a current of 150a in the baseball coil and 100a in the bias coil .",
    "this produces a relatively weak trapping potential ( see table1 ) with a bias field of 166.0(3)g in order to reduce the potential energy imparted to the cloud and to avoid the cs feshbach resonances that occur below @xmath101 g .",
    "when only a single species is collected in the science mot , typically up to 6(1)@xmath51 rb or 3(1)@xmath51 cs atoms can then be loaded into the magnetic trap .",
    "the effect of the displaced mot technique on the magnetic trap loading is vividly illustrated by absorption images of rb and cs atoms in the magnetic trap .",
    "figures [ pushbeam](b)-(e ) contain images of magnetically trapped clouds taken with and without the push beam on during the mot phase .",
    "the figure also contains vertical cross - sections of the atom clouds , showing the increase in optical depth for magnetically - trapped atoms loaded from the displaced mot .",
    "the flexibility of the displaced mot technique allows us to vary the composition of the trapped mixture over a wide range by adjusting the load duration of each species .",
    "we can load mixtures containing an equal amount of each species at close to their respective maximum single - species atom numbers . at the other extreme",
    ", we can load one species to its single - species maximum together with an arbitrarily small amount of the second species .",
    "preliminary observations show that the lifetime of the trapped atomic mixture in the magnetic trap at the load field of 166 g is consistent with the corresponding single - species lifetimes .",
    "this provides an excellent starting point for further experiments .",
    "ongoing and future experiments include the search for interspecies feshbach resonances and investigations of sympathetic cooling of cs with rb in a tight , low bias field trap .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated magnetic trapping of a mixture of cold cs and rb atoms in the @xmath102 and @xmath103 states . to our knowledge , this is the first time these states of rb and cs have been trapped together .",
    "after measurements on the rb - cs science mot showed strong losses due to light - assisted inelastic collisions between the two species , a simple but effective technique was developed which suppresses such collisions by spatially separating the rb and cs mots during loading .",
    "this method is not specific to the rb - cs mixture , and should prove useful in reducing loss in other two - species mots .",
    "a particular advantage is that the push beam technique allows considerable flexibility in the ratio of rb to cs atoms available for loading into the magnetic trap .",
    "our system thus represents an advantageous starting point for a range of experiments on cold rb - cs mixtures , including a search for interspecies feshbach resonances and studies of sympathetic cooling .",
