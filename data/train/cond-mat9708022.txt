    "<S> we consider two - dimensional degenerate electron gas in the presence of perpendicular random magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field disorder which is assumed to be gaussian is characterized by two parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the first is proportional to the amplitude of local magnetic field fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the second one characterizes the disorder on the longer scale - we call it the screening length . using kubo formula for the conductivity </S>",
    "<S> we have found a class of diagrams which leads to the long time tails in the current - current correlation function . for short times comparing to the diffusion time corresponding to the screening length this function behaves like logarithm of time , for longer times it decays like @xmath0 what of course puts in question the diffusive character of the behavior of the charged particle in random magnetic field widely assumed in the literature .    </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical description of two - dimensional , quantum , noninteracting , degenerate electron gas moving in a spatially random magnetic field attracts nowadays considerable attention in view of its possible relation to theory of quantum hall effect near the filling factor @xmath1 proposed by halperin and collaborators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic feature of these systems behavior is their temporal and spatial dispersion reflecting underlying microscopic motion nonlocality @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> progress in developing general theory capable of describing this dispersion in degenerate electron gas is rather slow . </S>",
    "<S> attempts were directed , therefore , to analysis of relatively simpler problem , namely the particle diffusion . in the recent work aronov , mirlin and </S>",
    "<S> wlfle @xcite proposed the derivation of the zero frequency diffusion coefficient for a two - dimensional degenerate electron gas in random magnetic field . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose a next step in the direction of the full analysis by using the kubo formula for the conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> analyzing a particular class of diagrams we have found the long time tails in the current current correlation function .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a gas of noninteracting , charged , spinless fermions moving on a two - dimensional plane in the presence of a spatially random magnetic field @xmath2 perpendicular to that plane . </S>",
    "<S> the single particle hamiltonian reads : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the magnetic field vector potential .    </S>",
    "<S> the paramount difficulty is now the choice of statistical ensemble for the random magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the seemingly obvious , and natural , choice of gaussian distributed magnetic field with the second moment @xmath5 results in infrared divergencies in the lowest order terms in the perturbation theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the long range vector potential correlations reflecting the fact that above gaussian distribution for magnetic field permits the field configurations in which arbitrary large magnetic flux is penetrating the plane . </S>",
    "<S> the mean square value of magnetic flux inside a region is proportional to its area , and this invalidates perturbational approach to the problem .    to avoid this </S>",
    "<S> we consider a model of the magnetic field disorder in which the above mentioned configurations are explicitly suppressed . to this effect </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the components of the vector potential @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) are the gaussian distributed quantities with zero mean , and which second order cumulant , in the fourier space , is given as @xmath8 where @xmath9 , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are some constants . </S>",
    "<S> this ensemble is closely related to that used by bausch , schmitz and turski @xcite in their analysis of the classical particle diffusion in crystals with randomly distributed topological defects . </S>",
    "<S> it is also identical to the one proposed by aronov , mirlin and wlfle @xcite . in </S>",
    "<S> their paper @xmath10 was proportional to the fluctuations of the magnetic field and @xmath11 was introduced at the intermediate steps of calculations as a `` soft cut - off '' in order to avoid the above mentioned infrared divergencies in the perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> they did nt discuss the meaning of this parameter , because it drops out from their final formula for the diffusion coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> this is true for the calculations in the lowest order in @xmath10 , as we shall see the higher order terms contain @xmath11 in the very nontrivial way </S>",
    "<S> .    one can attach a clear physical meaning to the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ correlation ] ) by analyzing an analogy between the above discussed model and another model of randomness in which these coefficients appear in a quite natural way . </S>",
    "<S> this auxiliary model has a well defined physical interpretation and long and short wavelength behaviors of both these models are identical .    </S>",
    "<S> imagine two identical , infinitely thin solenoids ( aharonov - bohm flux tubes ) piercing our plane at points separated by a distance @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic flux in one solenoid is @xmath13 and in the second @xmath14 . for sake of definiteness we shall call such an object a flux dipole . on the two - dimensional plane the dipole </S>",
    "<S> is characterized by its position , i. e. the coordinates of its `` center of mass '' and the angle @xmath15 between the vector joining the flux tubes and , say , the @xmath16 axis .    </S>",
    "<S> now we assume that we have many such dipoles penetrating the plane and let the average dipole density be @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the @xmath18th dipole @xmath19 may be arbitrary and the angle @xmath20 is homogeneously distributed in the interval @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that by construction our disorder ensemble allows only for configurations in which the total magnetic flux through the plane equals zero . </S>",
    "<S> for such kind of the magnetic disorder we obtain the following expression for the second moments of the fourier space components of the vector potential field @xmath22 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the zero order bessel function and @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the ensemble average denotes here @xmath27 where @xmath28 s the number of dipoles and @xmath29 is the area of the system ( @xmath30 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall also assume that the magnetic flux @xmath31 , thus we may neglect higher order cumulants which are of the order @xmath32 with ( @xmath33 ) . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively we may assume that the fluxes in different dipoles are mutually independent , gaussially distributed quantities with zero mean and the second moment equal to @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> in this case the higher order cumulants also vanish .    </S>",
    "<S> now discuss some properties of the introduced disorder . if the condition @xmath35 is satisfied then on the length scales shorter than @xmath12 ( we call @xmath12 the screening length in the following ) the magnetic field is spatially uncorrelated because the magnetic fluxes in randomly placed solenoids are mutually independent . </S>",
    "<S> this follows also from the behavior of @xmath36 for @xmath37 . in this limit @xmath38 , as for the delta correlated magnetic field . in the opposite limit , @xmath39 , the function @xmath40 and we have the case of spatially uncorrelated vector potential field . comparing the short and long wavelength behavior of the models defined by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ correlation ] ) and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ correl1 ] ) we see that they are indeed identical provided @xmath41 and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> whichever of the limiting behavior of the vector potential correlation is pertinent to an actual physical system depends on the value of the fermi wavelength for the electron gas . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in situation when the fermi wavelength @xmath43 is much smaller than @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> + in the zero temperature and @xmath45 limit kubo formula for the real part of the conductivity reads : @xmath46\\biggr\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is proportional to the @xmath16th component of the velocity operator and @xmath48 are retarded and advanced propagators corresponding to the one particle hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) . in position representation </S>",
    "<S> they have the form : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are eigenfunctions and corresponding eigenenergies . in the equation ( [ kubo ] ) </S>",
    "<S> tr denotes integration over @xmath52 and @xmath29 is the system s area . + in our analysis we apply the standard method of the averaging over the disorder @xcite . every green s function in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kubo ] ) is expanded in the power series of the components of the vector potential which we treat as a perturbation . in the second step every term of the resulting series </S>",
    "<S> is averaged according to the assumed properties of the magnetic field disorder . </S>",
    "<S> the exact summation of that series is impossible . </S>",
    "<S> what is usually done is the extraction and summation of certain classes of diagrams which are believed to give the most important contribution to the final result . </S>",
    "<S> the criterium of `` importance '' is based on the behavior ( an index of divergence ) of a corresponding analytical expression in the limit @xmath53 @xcite . in the present case </S>",
    "<S> the most divergent diagrams may be divided in two classes . </S>",
    "<S> the first class leads to renormalization of the one particle green s function ( the averaged green s function ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second class consists of the ladder diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> these two classes when summed up give the so called boltzmann value of the conductivity @xcite , or equivalently the boltzmann diffusion constant , if one uses the density - density response function instead of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kubo ] ) and extracts its low frequency and long wavelength behavior @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + this procedure well established and widely used in electrostatic potential disorder case , however , suffers here , from certain difficulty . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the self energy in the averaged green s function calculated for the disorder ensemble defined by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ correlation ] ) is infinite in the limit @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the averaged green s function in the limit @xmath55 equals @xmath56 where @xmath57 and even for very small density of dipoles @xmath17 or for very small amplitude of magnetic field fluctuations @xmath10 the self energy operator becomes dominant for large @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> of course we realize that the self energy in the averaged green s function has no direct physical meaning ( due to the fact that the greens function is not a gauge invariant object ) thus this infinity may be of no importance . </S>",
    "<S> such a point of view seems to be justified , because in the final expression for the diffusion constant ( a gauge invariant quantity ) calculated in the ladder diagram approximation the limit @xmath59 may be performed and the diffusion coefficient is finite . </S>",
    "<S> + on the other hand the methods of calculations of the diffusion coefficient ( for example by solving the dyson equation in the ladder diagram approximation @xcite ) depend on the assumption that @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the question arises whether the discussed difficulties concerning the breaking up the perturbation theory are spurious and arising on the intermediate steps of calculations only do not influence the final results or they are of physical origin and one should be very careful in dealing with them . + we think that the simplest method to answer this question is to perform the analysis of the diagrams divergencies similar to that presented by kirkpatrick and dorfman @xcite for the electrostatic potential disorder problem , i. e. to analyze the divergencies with respect to @xmath61 in the given order of the expansion parameter @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that it is enough to consider diagrams of the first order to notice some very interesting features . </S>",
    "<S> these diagrams are shown in fig .  1 . here </S>",
    "<S> the continuous lines correspond to the unperturbed green s functions @xmath62 and the broken line represents the averaging . </S>",
    "<S> the number of diagrams is much larger comparing to the case of electrostatic potential fluctuations case . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to first : the appearance of the second power of the vector potential in the hamiltonian - this term must be kept in order to conserve the gauge invariance , second : the appearance of the gauge invariant derivatives @xmath63 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kubo ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the first five diagrams 1a - 1e is the expansion of the green s function in powers of the vector potential . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , diagrams 1d and 1e correspond to the term @xmath64 in the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the diagrams 1f - 1i comes from the expansion of the green s function and from covariant derivatives , and the last diagram 1j represents the contraction of two @xmath65 s in two covariant derivatives in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kubo ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> + the first three diagrams are the lowest order diagrams belonging to the above discussed classes and although each of them separately is divergent in the limit @xmath66 , the sum of them has well defined limit and it constitutes the first order term in the density expansion for the frequency dependent conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> that sum behaves like @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the diagrams 1d and 1e do not give contribution to the real part of the conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions from the next four diagrams cancel . </S>",
    "<S> the last diagram 1j has an interesting behavior . </S>",
    "<S> its analytical expression is proportional to the integral @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that for @xmath71 it is finite for @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> however for @xmath73 it behaves like @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> such a behavior suggests possible relationship between @xmath61 and @xmath11 when both of them are small . + before proceeding further let us notice that up to now all the calculations have been performed in the coulomb , symmetric gauge . </S>",
    "<S> the same result however is obtained in the landau gauge @xmath75 . in that case </S>",
    "<S> all the diagrams originating from the covariant derivatives vanish and we are left with first five diagrams 1a-1e . </S>",
    "<S> again the diagrams 1d - 1e do not give contribution and for @xmath76 the @xmath74 divergence obtained previously from diagram 1j is contained now in the sum of first three diagrams 1a - 1c . </S>",
    "<S> of course this is nothing special , it should be so because the expression ( [ kubo ] ) is gauge invariant . </S>",
    "<S> + the natural generalization of the diagram 1j is presented at fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 the solid lines now represent the dressed green s functions . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting that assuming the diffusive behavior of the electron gas we may calculate the sum of these two diagrams exactly . </S>",
    "<S> namely , without the broken lines the sum of two diagrams is closely related to the density - density correlation function , more precisely it is proportional to the kubo relaxation function @xcite which for @xmath77 and @xmath45 behaves like @xmath78 that is why the analytical expression corresponding to the sum of the diagrams at fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 may be calculated and the final result reads : @xmath79 the eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ delta ] ) has no limit for @xmath45 ( @xmath80 ) . </S>",
    "<S> + it is interesting to write the sum of diagrams from fig .  2 in the `` time representation '' @xmath81 where @xmath82 is proportional to the current - current correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> from the above we see that for small times comparing to the diffusion time corresponding to the screening length ( @xmath83 ) @xmath84 and for asymptotically large times ( @xmath85 ) @xmath86 . + the obtained result is interesting and not entirely clear . first , </S>",
    "<S> in conjunction with the diagrammatic analysis presented earlier it suggests that the screening length or the `` soft cut - off '' in the terminology of aronov , mirlin and wlfle has important physical meaning determining time characteristics for the system . </S>",
    "<S> the power law decay of the function f(t ) is of the great interest . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 behavior suggests that the long time tails are of quantum origin @xcite , for the classical lorentz gas model would give @xmath87 behavior . to fully appreciate whether this decay is indeed of a quantum mechanical origin requires a detailed analysis of the velocity - velocity correlation function for the classical particle in random magnetic field . to the best of our best knowledge </S>",
    "<S> this is not available at the moment . </S>",
    "<S> + we should now return briefly to the discussion of the applicability of the perturbation theory . according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ aver ] ) perturbation theory is applicable if @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> consider now a part of the system , linear dimension of which is @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the typical magnetic field flux contained in that part of the system @xmath91 , consequently the typical magnetic field @xmath92 . for a particle of energy @xmath93 the corresponding cyclotron radius @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the condition @xmath95 may be rewritten as @xmath96 what means that the cyclotron radius corresponding to the local magnetic field fluctuation should be much larger then the screening length . </S>",
    "<S> + in conclusion we have studied the behavior of the two dimensional degenerate electron gas in the presence of the perpendicular random magnetic field . analyzing the lowest order diagrams we have pointed out the importance of the proper choice of the magnetic field disorder ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , taking into account certain class of diagrams we have obtained the long time tails in the current - current correlation function .    </S>",
