    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are binary star systems composed of a white dwarf ( primary ) and a secondary which is typically a late - type main sequence star .",
    "the secondary fills its roche lobe and matter falls down toward the primary spilling over from the inner lagrangian point ( @xmath1 point ) .",
    "dwarf novae ( dne ) are one of subtypes of cvs .",
    "dne undergo recurring outbursts .",
    "the outburst lasts for an order of days to weeks , during which their brightness increases by 2 to 5 mag .",
    "the outburst results from a release of gravitational energy which is caused by a sudden increase of the mass accretion rate by the thermal instability in the disk .",
    "su uma - type dwarf novae are a subclass of dne .",
    "they have relatively short orbital periods ( 12 hrs , near to the period minimum ) and occasional  superoutbursts \" that are brighter and have longer durations than the normal outbursts .",
    "the superhumps are believed to result from the tidal instability that is triggered when the disk radius reaches the critical radius for the @xmath2 resonance @xcite .",
    "wz sge - type dne are a subgroup of su uma - type dne .",
    "they have particularly short orbital periods and show infrequent large - amplitude superoutbursts [ for general properties of wz sge - type dne , see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] . during the superoutbursts , superhumps , periodic light variations",
    "whose period is a few percent shorter than the orbital period , are seen .",
    "the superhump periods vary through a course of three stages : the first is the stage a with a longer superhump period , the middle is the stage b with a systematically varying period , and the final is the stage c with a shorter superhump period @xcite .    according to the standard evolutionary theory of cvs ,",
    "the mass transfer from the secondary starts when the secondary fills its roche lobe .",
    "the orbital period @xmath3 is longer when a cv is formed and the system evolves with @xmath3 becoming shorter .",
    "once its @xmath3 reaches the period minimum , the secondary becomes oversized for its mass as a result of deviation from thermal equilibrium or becomes a brown dwarf which can not maintain in hydrogen burning . after this point , the system evolves toward longer period and it is usually called  period bouncer \" [ see e.g. @xcite and references there in , for standard evolutionary theory of cvs ] .",
    "the study about the period bouncers ought to play a vital role in resolving the problems about the terminal evolution of cvs , since it is said that @xcite estimated that 70% of cvs should have passed the period bounce .",
    "the candidates for the period bouncer , however , have hardly been discovered .",
    "one of the reasons is that cvs become much fainter as they approach the period minimum @xcite .",
    "@xcite also gave a great impact on the problem about the missing population in the cvs .",
    "they confirmed the secondary in the eclipsing short - period cv sdss 103533.03 + 055158.4 was a brown dwarf , which suggests that the system is the period bouncer .",
    "recently , @xcite discovered more three systems which have a brown dwarf secondary with high - speed three - color photometry .",
    "in photometric research in the period bouncers , until recently , wz sge - type dne with multiple rebrightenings such as eg cnc have been considered to be a good candidate for the period bouncer @xcite .",

    "they can not be detected in a system with a low inclination ( e.g. gw lib reported by @xcite ) , since the origin of early superhumps is the emission of a disk surface that has a non - axisymmetric vertical structure ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "these two dne are good candidates for the period bouncer .",
    "we then propose the general properties of candidates for the period bouncer as below :    * they show a very long growing stage of superhumps ( stage a ) and a large period decrease of the stage a - b transition ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the long stage a , which reflects the slow evolution of the superhump , is due to the very small mass ratios of these objects .",
    "* the decline rates in the plateau phase in the superoutburst of these objects are lower than those of su uma - type dne with the similar superhump period to these objects .",
    "to investigate whether our observation is able to account for the missing population of the period bouncers expected in the evolutionary theory , we counted how many su uma stars went through superoutbursts . in the recent five years , we have observed about 291 superoutbursts in 248 su uma - type stars and four good candidates for the period bouncer have been suggested , including ot j075418 and ot j230425 .",
    "three of four candidates were wz sge - like stars , and ot j230425 may have shorter recurrence time than the others .",
    "we estimated the number density of the period bouncers , excluding the systems like ot j230425 .",
    "although there is large uncertainty in the recurrence time of the period bouncers , we assumed superoutbursts of the period bouncers were @xmath71@xmath72 times more infrequent than those of ordinary su uma - type dne , according to the theoretical prediction . under this assumption , we can obtain roughly @xmath58(su uma)@xmath73 0.2412 .",
    "this ratio suggests a probability that the period bouncers we have identified can account for the missing population of the period bouncers expected from the evolutionary scenario .",
    "this work was supported by the grant - in - aid `` initiative for high - dimensional data - driven science through deepening of sparse modeling '' from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) of japan .",

    "<S> these objects showed a very long growing stage of the superhump ( stage a ) and a large period decrease in stage a - b transition . the long stage a suggests slow evolution of the superhump due to very small mass ratios of these objects . </S>",
    "<S> the decline rates during the plateau phase in the superoutburst of these objects were lower than those of su uma - type dne with a similar superhump period . </S>",
    "<S> these properties were similar to those of sss j122221.7@xmath0311523 , the best candidate for the period bouncer . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , these two dne are regarded as good candidates for the period bouncer . </S>",
    "<S> we estimated the number density of period bouncers roughly from our observations in the recent five years . </S>",
