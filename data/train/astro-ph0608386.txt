    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) have been used by at least two groups , and all without any explicit foreknowledge of their progenitors , to argue that the expansion of the universe is accelerating , and hence for the existence of `` dark energy , '' or a cosmological constant , @xmath5 ( see , e.g. , riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al .  1999 ) .",
    "this has the appearance of convenience , as it helps several other lines of inquiry , including the scale size of the fluctuations of the surface of last scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and measurements of the clustering mass on large scales ( see , e.g. eisenstein et al .",
    "2005 ) , converge to a consistent set of parameters , generally @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "however , at present sne ia represent the only firm , direct evidence for the existence of dark energy ( see , e.g. , conley et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "if dark energy has been convenient for cosmologists , it is certainly not so for the standard model , which allows no such subtle effect by 120 orders of magnitude ( weinberg 1989 ) . still",
    ", a lot of other recent efforts have gone into shoring up the case for cosmic acceleration ( see , e.g. , clocchiatti et al .  2006 ) , and there is no doubt that all are seeing the same effect .",
    "in addition , many have pointed out that the effect is still present even without using the width - luminosity ( wl ) relation , determined for local sne ia a decade earlier by phillips and others ( see , e.g. , phillips et al .",
    "1999 , and references therein ) , to correct the ia luminosities .",
    "however , recent observations have shown that sne ia have high velocity and polarized line features ( hvfs & plfs ) at the few % level @xcite , as well as a few tenths of a % mean continuum polarization .",
    "in addition , core - collapse ( cc ) in ia s may be _ necessary _ to explain many of the ms pulsars ( msps ) in the globular clusters ( gcs  see @xmath8[sec : ia / ic ? ] ) , and the abundance of zn @xcite .    in this letter",
    "i argue that many sne ia are caused by double - degenerate merger - induced cc ( dd ) which are classified as ia / c s when viewed from the merger equator / poles , the latter occurring only when sufficient matter exists in excess of that lost to the cc to screen the ia thermonuclear ( tn ) products .",
    "this complicates the use of sne ia in cosmology .",
    "i also argue that nearly all gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are due to dd , with all starting as the short duration and hard spectrum variety ( sgrbs ) , and only later are some modified to the long duration / soft spectrum variety ( @xmath4grbs ) , by interaction with the common envelope ( ce ) and previous polar ejection .",
    "in spite of initial mass estimates as high as 40 m@xmath3 for some sne ic progenitors ( sn 2002ap , 2003dh  mazzali et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) , no ia or ic progenitor has ever been identified ( see , e.g. , maund et al .",
    "2005 ) , and much lower mass binaries , such as ce wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , ( see , e.g. , demarco et al .  2003 ; howell et al .  2001 ; and the data in grny & tylenda 2000 ) ,",
    "have never been eliminated as ia / c progenitors ( gal - yam et al .",
    "2005 ) . the `` usual '' ia paradigm , ( gradual ) accretion - induced collapse of a white dwarf ( wd ) , or single degenerate ( sd ) , requires ignition and burn without core - collapse at the chadrasekhar mass ( 1.4 m@xmath1 ) , and also has difficulty explaining the absence of h and he from the wd and/or advected from the mass - donating companion star @xcite , the unsuitability of cataclysmic variables as progenitors @xcite , the four ia s in the last 26 years of the colliding elliptical / spiral galaxies of ngc 1316 ( see , e.g. , tsvetkov et al .  2005 , and references therein ) , and ia s which produce much more than 0.1 m@xmath1 of @xmath2ni from a single ignition source ( brown et al .",
    "2005 ) , though multiple sources of ignition have been discussed by r@xmath9pke et al .",
    "finally , in addition to their hvfs and plfs , ia s also show a broad range of diversity in their velocity gradients and correlations with si line ratios and @xmath10 ( hachinger et al .",
    "2006 ; james et al .",
    "2006 ) , all unlikely side effects of simple tn disruption .",
    "the morphology of the explosion of sn 1987a has now been clear for a number of years ( nasa et al .",
    "2003 ; wang et al .",
    "2002 ; middleditch 2004 , hereafter m04 ) . a polar blowout feature ( pbf )",
    "approaches at about 50@xmath11 off our line of sight ( see , e.g. , sugerman et al .",
    "it partially obscures an equatorial bulge / ball ( eb ) , behind which a part of the opposite , receding pbf is visible .",
    "the pbfs and eb are approximately equally bright .",
    "sn 1987a is thought to have ejected about 1015 m@xmath3 ( see , e.g. , woosley 1988 ) , and , because of the blue supergiant nature of the progenitor @xcite , the rings @xcite , the `` mystery spot '' @xcite , ergs some _ six weeks after _ being hit with a relativistic jet / beam ( m04  the deviation off the line of sight taking only 8 extra days ) . in this interpretation ,",
    "the `` mystery spot '' corresponds to the grb `` afterglow . '' ] the mixing @xcite , the polarization ( schwarz & mundt 1987 ; barrett 1988 ) , and the possible 2 ms pulsar remnant @xcite , is very likely to have been the result of a dd merger of two stellar cores .",
    "occam s razor alone would argue that ia s and ic s are the result of the same process(es ) , but there are many other good reasons . if ia s and ic s are the result of common - envelope wr dd mergers or co - co wd mergers common in gcs ( which leave msps  see , e.g. , chen et al .  1993 ) , then the limit for mass ejected is near 1.5 m@xmath3 , consistent with the @xmath01 m@xmath3 limit of @xmath2ni produced in sne ia @xcite",
    ".    if sne ia / c are the result of the same explosive process that underlay 1015 m@xmath3 in sn 1987a ( cc ) , but which instead only underlies 0.5 m@xmath3 , the outcome will be even more extreme than the geometry of the sn 1987a remnant . the pbfs will have higher velocities , and the equatorial / tn ball ( tnb ) will be much brighter due to the greater concentration of @xmath2ni , but its expansion velocity will not necessarily be higher than in iis , as the mean z for the outer ejecta will be higher . thus , there is no need to invoke exotic mechanisms such as `` gravitationally confined detonation '' to explain sne ia ( plewa et al .  2004 ) . when viewed close to the poles of the merger",
    ", one of the two pbfs will obscure the tnb ( if there is sufficient mass above the merger pole(s ) ) , and show lines of r - process intermediate mass elements ( imes ) from its end , and the sn will be classified as a ic , and for views very close to the poles , a hypernova signature will be seen , in addition to a grb ( m04 ) .",
    "wr and co - co mergers could account for grbs in both young and old populations ( i and ii  see , e.g. , mannucci et al .",
    "2006 ) . and although the ia : ic ratio in elliptical galaxies is @xmath1230 ( see , e.g. , the tables in van den berg et al .",
    "2005 ) , matter in excess of 1.4 m@xmath3 from two wds in older populations ( ii ) is rare .",
    "this picture of `` leaner '' mergers in non - actively star - forming galaxies is consistent with hamuy et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , sullivan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and wang et al .",
    "( 2006a ) , and may mean that the pbfs run out of sufficient matter to obscure the tnbs before these , in turn , run out of ejected tn ash , leading to relatively more ia s . because only sgrbs have ever been seen in elliptical galaxies , and globular clusters ( gcs ) require dd events to make many of their msps ( with `` recycled '' msps restricted mostly to core - collapsed clusters [ ccd ] such as ter 5 ) , four remarkable , fairly robust conclusions can be drawn .",
    "first , many sne ia in older populations _ must _ in fact be such cc events .",
    "second , because dd events must occur in elliptical galaxies and numerically exceed by far ns - ns merger events , the vast majority of the sgrbs in ellipticals result from their lean , dd events .",
    "third , _ all _ grbs start as sgrbs , and some convert to @xmath4grbs by impacting the ce , and some are further modified by impacting previous polar ejecta .",
    "fourth and finally , sgrbs can be produced by dd events without distantly observable afterglows or sne @xcite .",
    "unless the view _ is _ very near polar , this geometry will have no difficulty in producing split emission line(s ) on rare occasions , as was seen in sn 2003jd , and thus again there is no need to invoke other explosion mechanisms @xcite .",
    "when viewed sufficiently far from the poles , the tnb will dominate the luminosity , s / si absorption lines will appear / deepen , the sn will be classified as a ia , but similar high velocity lines will also appear from the sides of the pbfs due to material advected from the tnb , in addition to ime lines , including si again .",
    "the assumption implicit in ia cosmology is that the tnb will be a standard candle @xcite , which can be compared to the redshift of the host galaxy to determine the expansion properties of the universe .",
    "in the dd paradigm these @xcite result from sne ia having two pbfs of finite angular width .",
    "the half width angle of the pbfs can be estimated from the ratio of the numbers of nearby sne from catalogs . if we let @xmath13 be the tnb radius , below which sufficient visible ew in si and fe lines would result in the sn ia / c being classified as a ia , @xmath14 the radius of the limit cones of the pbfs at the same given time , @xmath15 the half angle of the pbf cones , @xmath16 the half angle of the cone circumscribed around the ( assumed spherical ) tnb and containing the circular boundary of the base of one pbf limit cone ( the visibility divider between ia s and ic s ) , and @xmath17 , then @xmath18 .",
    "counting sne with radial velocities",
    "@xmath19 km s@xmath20 , from sn 1995o to 2004cg in the sai catalog @xcite , gives 282 ia s , 66 ic s , and 301 type ii sne , for a ia : ic ratio of 4.27:1 , consistent with a 2:1 ia : ibc ratio in spirals from cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . using a 1:5 ratio for @xmath13 vs @xmath14 ( which might be an overestimate )",
    "gives @xmath21 , or @xmath22 and @xmath23 , a value consistent with the image of sn 1987a , and big enough so that hvfs from the pbfs will almost always occur , no matter what the orientation from which sne ( classified as ia ) are viewed .",
    "benetti et al .",
    "( 2005 ; hereafter b05 ) have divided sne ia into three categories , faint , and the brighter high and low velocity gradient ( hvg and lvg ) sne . in the pbf / tnb paradigm ,",
    "faint ia s are indeed intrinsically faint , producing little @xmath2ni , and their high velocity gradients and @xmath09,000 km s@xmath20 expansion velocities are the result of only a small amount of material in their ejecta , and thin polar ejecta and/or a near - equatorial view .",
    "the hvg sne ia are brighter , due to more @xmath2ni , and have @xmath012,000 km s@xmath20 expansion velocities , but are viewed substantially off the dd merger equator , where the opacities of conal pbf and advected tnb material diminish rapidly with time .",
    "the lvg sne ia are also bright , but have a low velocity gradient and @xmath010,000 km s@xmath20 expansion velocities because they are observed from near the equator of the dd merger .",
    "the increasing / decreasing evolution of @xmath24  ( si  ii ) ( i.e. , temperature ) with time of hvg / lvg sne ia is consistent with this interpretation ( figure 2 of b05 ) .",
    "four out of five of the faint ia s in b05 fall below the wl relation by 12 _ whole _",
    "magnitudes , and yet their @xmath10 s fall just barely outside the validity range for the wl relation ( @xmath251.75 ) . however , the spectra of all of these show a deep tiii trough between 4,000 and 4,500 @xmath26 , visible even at cosmological distances , and thus can be safely excluded from the sample used for cosmology . but problems could still arise if a continuous class exists between faint and hvg and/or lvg , as might reasonably be expected . in this case , it might be possible that , because of the assumption of an invalid paradigm for sne ia ( sd ) , and the desire to avoid contaminating the sample of ia s by including sne which appeared too `` ic - ish , '' with too much ew in ime lines , and too little in the sii and siii lines , a local sample of ia s was selected in which many were viewed very close to the equator of the dd merger .",
    "when the high velocity of the small amount of matter in near - polar ejecta of ia s exposes a fraction of the tnb to non - equatorial views during the interval when @xmath27 is measured , insufficient wl corrections could result in distant ia s which appear to faint for their redshifts .",
    "continuum polarization near the 0.90.4% level was detected in the type iip sn 1987a @xcite , two out of three type iis observed by wang et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , 1994y , and 1995h , at nearly _ twice _ that level in the type iib sn 1993j @xcite , and 0.20.5% in the type iip sn 1999em , 7 to 159 days after maximum , by leonard et al .",
    "thus , continuum polarization in iis is ( and should be ) common due to their pbfs having approximately equal brightness as their ebs .",
    "continuum polarization is markedly low or absent in ia s , typically @xmath250.2% , with the exceptions of sn 1996x at 0.3% ( wang et al .",
    "1997 ) , the faint sn 1999by at 0.30.8% @xcite , the lvg sn 2001el , near 0.20.3% @xcite , the lvg sn 2003du at 0.3% @xcite , and sn 2005hk at 0.4% @xcite .",
    "this is exactly what is expected for ia s because the tnb is roughly spherical , and dominates the luminosity of ia s , where the pbfs are viewed from the sides , but are not bright enough to matter .",
    "sn 1999by was highly polarized because it was a faint sn ia , and the pbfs did matter .",
    "sn 2005hk was less luminous ( likely a member of the faint class ) than 2001el , and thus its level of continuum polarization is higher .    in contrast ,",
    "the ca ii 800 nm ir triplet and the si ii @xmath28 6355 @xmath26 ( absorption ) lines in nearly all sne ia show higher polarizations , particularly those with high velocities , which is a result of the lines preferentially originating from the sides of the pbfs , visible ( by definition ) in all ia s ( kasen et al .  [",
    "2003 ] on sn 2001el `` the high velocity triplet absorption [ 800 nm ca ii ] is highly polarized @xmath29 '' ; wang et al .",
    "[ 2003 ] `` @xmath30 is distinct in velocity space from the photospheric ca ii ir triplet and has a significantly higher degree of polarization ( @xmath310.7% ) and different polarization angle than the continuum @xmath30 kinematically distinct feature with matter distributed in a filament @xmath30 almost edge - on to the line of sight @xmath29 '' ) .",
    "line polarization occurs in increasing strength in overluminous , normal , subluminous , and high velocity sne ( hv  broad lines , blueshifted up to 15,000 km s@xmath20 ) in observations @xcite , as well as naturally in the tnb / pbf paradigm .",
    "clearly the polarization of ia s should increase as apparent luminosity ( the visible tnb ) decreases , until so little matter remains to be ejected into the pbf that it becomes optically thin ( see @xmath8[sec : ia / ic ? ] ) .",
    "thus the strength of the line polarization is only 0.2% in the overluminous sn 2003du , but is 2% in lower luminosity hv sne such as 2004dt @xcite , again consistent with the pbf / tnb paradigm for ia / c s .",
    "polarization in ic s is more complicated , as those seen most end - on will also have blueshifted hv lines , but will appear to be spherical , so little polarization will result .",
    "however , when both pbfs are visible , the extension in one direction will produce polarization , just as it does in type iis , and may exceed that in iis due to the rapid extension of the higher velocity pbfs and the obscured , or even the non - obscured , but faded , eb / tnb .",
    "these are the ic analog of the hv ia s .",
    "the continuum polarization of the ic sn 2002ap rose from 0 to 0.5% from -6 to + 3 days from maximum @xcite , and later to 1.0% and 1.6% on days 16 and 37 respectively @xcite .",
    "the merger paradigm also explains why types ib and ii sne produce relatively little @xmath2ni , because their c and o layers are diluted with he , in addition to h for iis , due to the merger process . aside from type ii - l sne , type iis ,",
    "initiated through fe photodissociation catastrophe , suspected for sn 1986j ( bietenholz et al .",
    "2004 ) , may so far be the only known exceptions to the merger paradigm , and the vast bulk of these , i.e. , those which do not continue to collapse into black holes , should be brighter than dd type iis due to their c and o layers remaining relatively undiluted at the time of cc , in addition to their embedded , strongly magnetized pulsars . in dd ia / c , which all lack h and he , not only are the c and o layers undiluted , they are intimately mixed .",
    "so if iis manage to produce _ some _ @xmath2ni , then even cc ia s ought to produce much _",
    "more_.      i have argued above that many sne ia and ic are the result of the same process , dd events of wr or co - co wd binaries , in order to produce their hvfs and plfs , and their inverse relation to ia luminosity , many of the msps in old populations , sgrbs and @xmath4grbs , the four recent ia s of the colliding spiral / elliptical galaxies of ngc 1316 , the @xmath121 m@xmath3 of @xmath2ni produced in sn 2003fg , and possibly the observed abundance of zn .",
    "this complicates the utility of ia s to cosmological efforts , with at least one possible systematic effect which could produce distant ia s which appeared to be too faint for their redshifts ( see the end of @xmath8[sec : hvfia ] ) , potentially adding to other systematics , some of which could have the opposite effect , such as malmquist bias .",
    "in addition , a 7% ibc contamination level is sufficient to produce @xmath32 from no effect ( homeier 2005 ) .",
    "small wonder then that statistical considerations alone may rule out _ any _ cosmology derived from sne ia ( vishwakarma 2005 ) .",
    "is there likely still _ any _ @xmath33 effect at all left in ia cosmology ?",
    "only time will tell .",
    "i have also argued above that all grbs begin as sgrbs before some are changed into @xmath4grbs by interaction with matter in the binary merger ce and previous polar ejection .",
    "this could help to greatly simplify the study of grbs because the initial photon energy spectrum of the vast majority of grbs is now more - or - less known .    using astronomical sources of any kind to determine the nature of the universe is a tough business . divining the structure of sne using only spectroscopic data ( and even the occasional polarization spectrum ) , an inverse problem for which very little progress has been made over several past decades , only increases the difficulty immeasurably . in sn",
    "1987a nature has revealed the origin and structure of most sne , including sn 1993j , and all we have to do is to pay attention .",
    "the sn ia cosmology effort sets all records for blood and treasure spent on a problem in astronomy .",
    "it was a gamble , but one that may not pan out .",
    "the attempt to use a misunderstood phenomenon to measure cosmological parameters is perhaps understandable , but ultimately unwise .",
    "supernovae are indeed wondrous objects , with up to 99% resulting from dd events .",
    "these may all produce @xmath02 ms pulsars which , in their first few seconds after birth , may very well be the only frequently detectable gravitational radiation sources , and which , for at least a few years , shine in the optical band @xcite . many of their progenitors are not massive stars , and many produce jets , grbs , and what astronomers have dubbed `` mystery spots , '' `` grb afterglows , '' `` type ii - p plateaus , '' `` hypernovae , '' `` collapsars , '' `` supranovae , '' and my personal favorite , `` the beam from hell , '' from what could appear to be unremarkable 20th magnitude blue stragglers , which can incinerate half the planet from a great distance with little or no warning . what they are _",
    "not _ , however , are easily utilized standard candles , and @xmath34 may _ not _ be the `` correct '' answer",

    "the attempt to use sne iip to measure cosmological parameters ( see , e.g. , h@xmath9flich et al .",
    "2001 ; nugent et al .",
    "2006 ) , faces the difficulty that even though most of these result from dd mergers of more massive stars , then , like sn 1987a ( and possibly 1993j ) , they will still manage to produce beams / jets which may or may not impact their previous polar ejection to produce a `` mystery spot , '' ( or two ) .",

    "namely , that the nccd gcs do nt produce pulsars like 1920 + 57 , 1937 + 21 , m15 a , b , c , & g , because these are likely to have been `` recycled , '' via accretion , leading to magnetic pole migration toward the rotational axis due to accretion stresses , and not born fast , via merger , leading to wider , more frequently double pulse profiles . confirming this is the low luminosity of pulsars found in ter 5 , relative to pulsars in nccd gcs ( ransom 2006 ) , which is very likely a selection effect in favor of narrow pulses because of their fourier properties , making them more detectable even than higher luminosity , higher dutycycle pulsars .",

    "<S> the unexpected faintness of distant type ia supernovae ( sne ) has been used to argue for an accelerated expansion of the universe , with the understanding that these are thermonuclear disruptions of accreting white dwarfs . however , the high velocity and polarized features observed in sne ia , and their inverse relation to luminosity , particularly for polarization , are consistent with an extreme version of the axisymmetry now seen in sn 1987a , which could be the result of double - degenerate merger - induced core - collapse . </S>",
    "<S> this could be the correct paradigm for many type i and ii sne , where ia s are both thermonuclear _ and _ core - collapse objects , which leave weakly magnetized , rapidly spinning ( @xmath02 ms ) pulsars . in this paradigm </S>",
    "<S> , a ia / c is produced from the merger of two degenerate cores of common envelope wolf - rayet stars , or of two co white dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> thus the same explosive mechanism that underlay 1015 m@xmath1 in sn 1987a , underlies only 01.5 m@xmath1 in sne ia / c . </S>",
    "<S> its now visible polar blowout features produce the observed high velocity and polarized spectral features in ia s , and its equatorial bulge is much brighter in ia s , due to the greater fraction of @xmath2ni contained within it . </S>",
    "<S> such merger sne become classified as ia s when viewed from the merger equator , and ic s when viewed from the poles ( given sufficient matter in excess of the 1.4 m@xmath3 lost to core - collapse ) , where a hypernova signature and a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) will be observed for lines of sight close to the merger axis . </S>",
    "<S> this complication may mean that cosmology determined strictly from ia s alone is flawed , because the local sample may be selectively biased . </S>",
    "<S> finally , all grbs start as the short - duration , hard - spectrum variety ( sgrbs ) , after which some are modified to the long duration / soft spectrum variety ( @xmath4grbs ) by interaction with the merger common envelope and/or previous polar ejection . </S>",
    "<S> thus the initial photon spectrum of nearly all grbs is known . </S>"
