    "phase - field models have been introduced by g.caginalp in @xcite ( see also e.g. @xcite for generalizations ) as a relaxation of stefan problems where the development of the sharp interface between phases should be found exactly .",
    "in contrast to that , phase field models operate with phase functions that assume values from -1 ( solid state ) to 1 ( liquid state ) at each spatial point and change sharply but smoothly over the solidification fronts so that the phase interfaces become smoothed . mathematically speaking , such models consist of two coupled parabolic equations describing the temperature and phase fields satisfying initial and boundary conditions .",

    "relation , phase field models are useful for the description of transitions between supercritical , ordinary , and dissolved co@xmath2 phases .    in this paper , we study the case where a material subjected to a phase change is located inside of a container with heat conductive walls that are not subjected to phase changes . for example , this can be an ampoule filled with a liquid containing living cells ( see ( * ? ? ?",
