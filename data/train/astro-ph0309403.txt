    "cygnusa is one of the most powerful radio galaxies at a redshift of ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "it is the archetypical frii radio galaxy . in the radio bands ,",
    "cygnusa is characterized by two strong lobes separated by @xmath42@xmath5 in the sky .",
    "two highly collimated jets connect the lobes with the core ( perley et al .",
    "1984 ; carilli et al .",
    "on kiloparsec scales , the jet is oriented along p.a . @xmath6 and the fainter counter - jet along p.a",
    ". @xmath7 . due to the large inclination of the jet with respect to the observer , and the correspondingly reduced relativistic effects",
    ", cygnusa is an ideal candidate for detailed studies of its jet physics , which is thought to be similar to those of luminous quasars ( e.g. barthel 1989 ) .",
    "we present and discuss results from multi - frequency vlbi observations at 15 , 22 and 43ghz and from the first multi - frequency phase referenced observations of cygnusa done with the vlba at 15 and 22ghz . to complement our data at 15ghz we used ten epochs from the vlba 2 cm survey ( kellermann et al .",
    "1998 ; zensus et al . 2002 ) to analyse the source kinematics with improved accuracy .",
    "we observed cygnusa in 1996 with the vlba+effelsberg at 15 , 22 , and 43ghz , in 2002 at 5 and 15ghz and in 2003 with the vlba only at 15 and 22ghz in phase - referencing mode .",
    "all observations were done in dual circular polarization and were correlated in socorro .",
    "the data were reduced in the standard manner using aips .",
    "the imaging of the source implying phase and amplitude self - calibration was done using difmap .",
    "after imaging we fitted circular gaussian components to the self - calibrated data in order to parameterise the source structure .",
    "conservatively , we assume errors of @xmath8% in the flux density arising from the uncertainties of the amplitude calibration and from the formal errors of the model fits .",
    "an estimate for the position error is given by @xmath9 ( fomalont  1989 ) , where @xmath10 is the residual noise of the map after the subtraction of the model , @xmath11 the width of the component , and @xmath12 the peak flux density .",
    "this formula tends to underestimate the error if the peak flux density is very high or the width of the component is small . in the case of a small fwhm we used the beam size instead",
    "to investigate the spectral properties and the kinematics of cygnusa on parsec scales we cross - identified individual model components along the jet using their relative separation from each other , their flux density and size . since the observations from 2003 were phase - referenced , we compared the alignment between the two frequencies from the modelfits with those from the phase - referencing and found similar results . the most likely position for the central engine",
    "is located between component c3 and j10 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this position shows a slightly inverted spectrum and turned out to be stable in our kinematical study .",
    "it seems to be the same position , which krichbaum et al .",
    "( 1998 ) already used in their study .",
    "figure  1 ( left ) shows the hybrid maps at 15 and 22ghz with the positions of the modelfit components denoted by dotted lines .",
    "the images are registered using phase - referencing to the quasar 2005 + 403 at a distance of @xmath13 . on the right hand side",
    "the spectral indices between 15 , 22 and 43ghz are plotted versus the core distance , assuming n is the core .",
    "our analysis reveals that the core spectrum is slightly inverted with a spectral index of @xmath14 .",
    "the jet shows a steep spectrum with spectral indices of @xmath15 to @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the counter - jet has a highly inverted spectrum with @xmath18 up to 2.5 in the inner part ( @xmath19mas ) and a flat spectrum between 15 and 22ghz further out . between 22 and 43ghz the counter - jet spectrum",
    "is inverted with a spectral index of @xmath20 . the inverted spectrum on the counter - jet side is likely due to free - free absorption by a foreground absorber .",
    "this is supported by the spectral behavior of the jet to counter - jet flux density ratio ( krichbaum et al .",
    "1998 ; bach et al . 2002 ) .",
    "uv spectroscopy ( antonucci et al . 1994 ) and optical spectro - polarimetry ( ogle et al .",
    "1997 ) also show evidence for a hidden broad line region .",
    "according to the unified scheme , this is strong evidence for an obscuring torus around the central engine and is consistent with the results from 21 cm absorption line vlbi ( blanco & conway 1996 ) .",
    "figure  2 shows the component positions against time after a careful identification and linear fits to those , yielding apparent velocities @xmath21 as follows . on the jet side",
    "the components start with 0.1masyr@xmath22 near the core and accelerate to 0.25masyr@xmath22 at larger separations . in cygnusa 1mas corresponds to 0.8@xmath23pc so that an apparent motion of 0.1masyr@xmath22 corresponds to @xmath24 .",
    "the situation on the counter - jet side is less clear than on the jet side .",
    "the components are weaker and more extended than on the jet side .",
    "the innermost component c3 shows a marginal motion of @xmath25masyr@xmath22 and the next component c2 seems to travel inwards with @xmath26masyr@xmath22 . in the epochs with the highest quality data ,",
    "component c2 consists of two nearly equally bright components . the apparent inward motion",
    "thus might be due to blending effects of these sub - components .",
    "a summary of the component speeds is given in table  2 .",
    "crr|crr comp & & & comp & & + c2 & @xmath26 & @xmath27 & j5 & @xmath28 & @xmath29 + c3 & @xmath30 & @xmath31 & j4 & @xmath32 & @xmath33 + j9 & @xmath34 & @xmath35 & j3 & @xmath36 & @xmath37 + j8 & @xmath38 & @xmath39 & j2 & @xmath40 & @xmath41 + j7 & @xmath38 & @xmath42 & j1 & @xmath38 & @xmath43 + j6 & @xmath44 & @xmath45 & +    from the right panel in fig .  2",
    "it seems that the jet components accelerate as they travel down the jet and reach there maximum speed of @xmath46 at a distance of @xmath47mas . using @xmath48 , which is maximized at @xmath49 and with @xmath50 one can calculate the lower limit of the intrinsic velocity @xmath51 of @xmath52 and the corresponding angle to the line of sight of @xmath53 .",
    "indeed , the analysis of the jet to counter - jet ratio also favors a large inclination of @xmath54 ( krichbaum et al .",
    "1998 ; bach et al . 2002 ) .    due to the small relativistic effects at such conditions , the angle to the line of sight needs to change by more than @xmath55 to explain the observed velocities by geometrical jet curvature .",
    "since the jet appears to be very straight from parsec to kiloparsec scales , it is more likely that we observe a true acceleration , possibly caused by the collimation of the jet in the inner 2parsec .",
    "alternatively , we might observe a highly stratified jet with the different velocities belonging to different layers in the jet .",
    "this idea can also explain the absence of detectable motions on the counter - jet side .",
    "due to the fact that we see the counter - jet from its ` back ' the emission of the faster components is beamed away from us and we observe only the slower velocities of the outer sheath of the counter - jet .",
    "bach et al . ( 2002 ) detected apparent motion of @xmath56 on the counter - jet side at a distance of @xmath57mas from the core at 5ghz , but this optically thin component is no more visible at 15ghz . from the assumption of a simple knigl jet ( knigl  1981 ) and an inclination of 65 ",
    "80@xmath58 we would expect a proper motion of @xmath59 on the counter - jet side . that we do not see these ` high ' velocities on the counter - jet points to a more complicated jet structure .",
    "we carried out the first phase - referencing observations of cygnusa with the vlba at 15 and 22ghz .",
    "the analysis of this data and a multi - frequency observation from 1996 at 15 , 22 and 43ghz revealed the spectral properties of the innermost jet structure in cygnusa .",
    "we found a slightly inverted core and a steep jet spectrum . on the counter - jet side the inner part ( @xmath19mas )",
    "shows a highly inverted spectrum with an @xmath18 of up to 2.5 and @xmath60 . in the outer regions the counter - jet shows a flat spectrum between 15 and 22ghz and is still inverted between 22 and 43ghz . together with the frequency dependence of the jet to counter - jet ratio ( krichbaum et al .",
    "1998 ; bach et al . 2002 ) there is strong evidence that this is due to free - free absorption by an obscuring torus .",
    "the apparent acceleration in the jet and the absence of detectable motions on the counter - jet side might reflect a more complicated jet structure than that of the simple knigl jet with a well defined jet flow and questions the assumption that the jet and counter - jet are intrinsically the same .",
    "the observations could be explained by a stratification of the jet were we observe different velocities sheaths depending on the optical depth and the orientation of the jet .",
    "we thank the group of the vlba 2 cm survey for providing their data .",
    "this work made use of the vlba , which is an instrument of the national radio astronomy observatory , a facility of the national science foundation , operated under cooperative agreement by associated universities , inc . and of the 100 m telescope at effelsberg , which is operated by the max - planck - institut fr radioastronomie in bonn ."
