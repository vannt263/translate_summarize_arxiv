    "5 we show the contribution to @xmath2 from the nmssm higgs sector as a function of @xmath135 for various values of @xmath138 .",
    "as we mentioned in the previous section , the negative one - loop contribution dominates below @xmath144  gev , while the two - loop diagram dominates for larger masses .",
    "since both contributions decrease when the pseudoscalar becomes heavy , the total higgs contribution becomes maximal around @xmath145  gev .",
    "constraints from b physics ( essentially from @xmath146 and @xmath147 ) depend mainly on the loop - induced @xmath113 coupling @xcite , and are particularly strong for @xmath148  gev . for fixed @xmath138 ( and sfermion masses and",
    "trilinear couplings at @xmath149  tev , @xmath150 , @xmath151  gev , and @xmath152  tev ) we varied the remaining parameters @xmath61 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 in the higgs sector of the nmssm and obtained regions near @xmath155  gev , which are _ always _ excluded  these regions are indicated as dashed parts of the curves in fig .",
    "5 . for larger @xmath138 and corresponding larger values of @xmath61 , the forbidden regions are larger . for @xmath156 ,",
    "the forbidden region extends up to @xmath157  gev .",
    "@xmath158  gev , where the total higgs contribution can be relatively large , can be consistent with b  physics constraints , however .     as a function of the pseudoscalar mass.,width=13 ]    the previous results concern certain regions of the relatively large parameter space of the general ( low energy ) nmssm .",
    "next we consider the impact of @xmath2 on the cnmssm with universal scalar and gaugino masses ( @xmath159 and @xmath160 ) as well as universal trilinear couplings ( @xmath161 ) at the gut  scale .",
    "such a model is motivated by flavour - blind , supergravity - induced susy breaking scenarios .",
    "a recent study of the cnmssm parameter space spanned by @xmath75 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 @xcite showed that lep constraints on higgs scalars and , notably , a dark matter relic density in agreement with wmap constraints require @xmath162 , @xmath163 and that @xmath161 is determined in terms of @xmath160 .",
    "consequently , the complete higgs and sparticle spectrum depends essentially only on @xmath160 , which can _ a priori _ vary between 400  gev and 23  tev ( where all other constraints on sparticle masses and from b - physics are satisfied ; the lower limit on @xmath160 originates simultaneously from the lower experimental bound on stau masses and lep constraints on higgs scalars ) .    using the most recent version of nmssmtools @xcite , we have computed the spectrum and the supersymmetric contributions to @xmath20 in the cnmssm as a function of @xmath160 , with the result shown in fig .  6 .",
    "as a function of @xmath160 in the cnmssm , width=13 ]    we see that the constraint from @xmath2 confines the allowed range of @xmath160 to @xmath164  tev at the @xmath121 level , and to 400  gev  @xmath165 700  gev ( where the sparticle spectrum is not too heavy ) at the @xmath128 level .",
    "in fact , the present experimental value could be matched to arbitrarily high precision , and a more precise measurement of @xmath2 could determine @xmath160 completely .    in the cnmssm , the leading susy contributions to @xmath2",
    "originate from the mssm - like one - loop diagrams . besides the chargino / sneutrino loop , the bino / smuon contribution is also quite significant .",
    "on the other hand , contributions from the higgs sector are always negligible in the cnmssm , since the lightest pseudoscalar is not very light .",
    "to summarize , the deviation ( [ deviation ] ) of the measured value of @xmath2 from the sm can be explained in the nmssm as in the mssm since  in the absence of a light cp - odd higgs scalar ",
    "the corresponding contributions are practically the same . in the presence of a light cp - odd higgs",
    "scalar the nmssm specific contributions to @xmath2 are not negligible in general ( depending on @xmath138 and @xmath135 , see figs .  4 and 5 ) and , for @xmath166 3  gev , can allow for a heavier sparticle spectrum .",
    "the msugra - like cnmssm is consistent with constraints from @xmath2 , which can help to confine the remaining free parameter @xmath160 .",
