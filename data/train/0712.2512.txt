    "another effect can contribute to the decay @xmath3 , namely the @xmath18 mixing predicted in 1979 @xcite . qualitatively speaking , loops with virtual @xmath19 and @xmath20 pairs cancel one another , but this cancellation is not perfect due to the difference in mass of charged and neutral kaons .",
