    "the change of variables is known to be a useful method of extracting the most relevant degrees of freedom to the physics in question .",
    "a proposal along this direction for the topological degrees in yang - mills theory was first made by cho @xcite , which have recently been readdressed by faddeev and niemi @xcite , and another by faddeev and niemi @xcite .",
    "the former is called the cho  faddeev  niemi ( cfn ) decomposition in the literatures , while the latter is called the faddeev  niemi decomposition .",
    "we focus on the former in this paper .    in applying the cfn decomposition ,",
    "however , there were much controversy @xcite over the treatment and the interpretation .",
    "a lot of progress toward the resolution of the conceptual issues was already made in @xcite , while the cfn decomposition was applied to reveal various non - perturbative features overlooked so far @xcite .",
    "for example , the skyrme  faddeev model @xcite describing glueball as the knot soliton solution may be deduced from the yang - mills theory by way of the cfn decomposition @xcite . moreover",
    ", the instability of the savvidy vacuum @xcite disappears by eliminating a tachyon mode @xcite , see @xcite for the massless gluon and @xcite for the massive gluon caused by a novel magnetic condensation .    in the previous paper @xcite",
    ", we have given a new interpretation of the yang - mills theory written in terms of the cfn variables , called the cfn - yang - mills theory .",
    "this interpretation enables us to elucidate how the cfn - yang - mills theory with the enlarged local gauge symmetry is reduced to the gauge theory with the same local and global gauge symmetries ( yang - mills theory ii ) as the original yang - mills theory ( yang - mills theory i ) .",
    "in fact , this is achieved by imposing the new version of the maximal abelian gauge ( new mag ) , which plays quite a different role from the conventional mag @xcite .",
    "the new interpretation disposes of a pending question of discrepancy between the cfn - yang - mills theory and the original yang - mills theory for independent degrees of freedom .    in the paper @xcite ,",
    "we have already discussed how to perform the numerical simulations based on this interpretation and we have actually performed the monte carlo simulations on a lattice .",
    "this is the first implementation of the cfn decomposition on a lattice .    in this paper ,",
    "moreover , we will discuss how to perform the brst quantization of the cfn - yang ",
    "mills theory in the continuum formulation , as announced in @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", we must first determine the nilpotent brst transformations for the ghost - antighost fields and the nakanishi - lautrup auxiliary fields , in addition to those for the original cfn variables . here",
    "it should be remarked that we must introduce more ghost and antighost fields reflecting the enlarged local gauge symmetry of the cfn - yang ",
    "mills theory .",
    "these brst transformations are determined independently from the gauge fixing condition , i.e. , the new mag , as usual .    in order to fix the whole gauge degrees of the cfn - yang - mills theory ,",
    "we must impose one more gauge - fixing condition , e.g. , lorentz covariant gauge @xmath8 , in addition to the new mag .",
    "the additional gauge fixing is necessary to fix the local gauge symmetry ii in the yang - mills theory ii which is obtained by taking the new mag from the cfn - yang - mills theory .",
    "then , we can obtain the explicit form of the faddeev ",
    "popov ( fp ) ghost terms associated to two gauge - fixing conditions , once the additional gauge - fixing condition is specified .",
    "therefore , we can uniquely determine the total lagrangian , based on which the brst quantization is performed .",
    "moreover , we introduce another gauge transformation and the corresponding brst transformation , called the primed transformations .",
    "this gives an alternative but equivalent description of the gauge and brst symmetries of the cfn - yang ",
    "mills theory . finally",
    ", we determine also the nilpotent anti - brst transformation for the cfn variables . as an application",
    ", we propose a modified version of the new mag , which is both brst and anti - brst exact simultaneously .",
    "the cho  faddeev - niemi ( cfn ) decomposition ( or change of variables ) of the original yang - mills gauge field @xmath9 is performed as follows .",
    "we restrict our consideration to the gauge group @xmath10 .",
    "first , we introduce a unit vector field @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 then the cfn decomposition is written in the form , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is perpendicular to @xmath15 , @xmath16 for later convenience , we introduce @xmath17    the first important observation made in @xcite is that the restricted potential @xmath18 and gauge covariant potential @xmath19 are specified by @xmath15 and @xmath20 as @xmath21{\\bm n}(x ) , \\label{def : x}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and , therefore , _ the local gauge transformations @xmath22 and @xmath23 are uniquely determined , once only the transformations @xmath24 and @xmath25 are specified_. this fact indicates a special role played by the @xmath15 field in the gauge transformation .    in the previous paper @xcite , we have considered the local gauge symmetry respected by the yang - mills theory expressed in terms of the cfn variables , which we call _ cfn  yang - mills theory _ for short .",
