    "from 1999 till the present time , the staff of the electrodynamics laboratory `` proton21 '' carries on the experiments on the explosion - induced compression of a substance , which leads to the creation of superdense states . till october 2003 , over 5000 dynamical impact compressions of solid targets were performed at the laboratory .",
    "the goal of these experiments is the verification of the preliminarily theoretically justified hypothesis of the possibility to initiate , by using the pulse coherent action on a solid substance , the self - organizing process of avalanche - like self - densification up to the state of collapse ( of the electron - nucleus plasma ) , in which the conditions for the running of collective many - particle nuclear reactions arise due to the effective screening of the coulomb barrier . for the verification of this hypothesis",
    ", the laboratory s staff constructed the experimental setup which is able to transfer up to 1kj of energy to a solid target for a pulse duration of about 10ns with the help of the electron beam used as a primary carrier of the concentrated energy . at the culmination stage of the process , the microvolume of the target substance was compressed up to a density of above @xmath2@xmath3 . in this case , the power density in the region of compression exceeded , by various estimations , @xmath4w/@xmath5 .",
    "the impact compression of a target was realized in vacuum of about @xmath6pa and led to its fracture by the explosion from inside .",
    "this process was usually accompanied by the radial dispersion of a target material with its deposition on a special accumulating disk - like screen of about 15 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm in thickness .",
    "[ fig_est01 ] presents the photos of both a typical target after the explosion ( a ) and a typical accumulating screen with deposited products of the explosion ( b ) which were derived with a scanning electron microscope in the secondary - electron mode . by using the method of scanning electron microscopy ( sem )",
    ", we established that the products , which remained in the target crater and precipitated on accumulating screens , formed a layer of irregularly distributed drops , splashes , films , particles , and other micro- and nanoobjects with complicated morphology .",
    "because the explosion products are microobjects , we firstly studied them mainly with local methods . to investigate their element and isotope compositions , we used x - ray electron probe microanalysis ( xepma ) , local auger electron spectroscopy ( aes ) , laser mass spectrometry ( lms ) , and secondary - ion mass spectrometry ( sims ) . by using the methods of mass spectrometry , we discovered deviations of the isotope composition from the natural abundance of isotopes for a number of chemical elements contained in these products  @xcite . while studying the chemical composition of products of the explosion by xepma , aes , and sims , we registered up to several tens of chemical elements in significant amounts in every analysis [ including those cases where both a target and an accumulating screen were made of a single chemical element maximally purified from impurities , e.g. , cu ( 99.99 mass .",
    "% ) , ag ( 99.99 mass .",
    "% ) , pb ( 99.75 mass .",
    "% ) , and others ] .",
    "these elements were not found by high - sensitivity analytical methods in the initial materials of targets and accumulating screens or were present in them as impurities but at concentrations by 3  7 orders and more less than those measured after the experiment  @xcite . moreover , while studying the specimens by aes , we registered a collection of auger - peaks which can not be referred , on the one hand , to artefacts of the analysis and , on the other one , be related to any auger - peaks of the known chemical elements  @xcite .",
    "the mentioned auger - peaks were referred by us in the scope of the known part of the periodic table to basically unidentifiable peaks . as one of the variants of the interpretation of the revealed unidentifiable auger - peaks , the assumption as for their affiliation to long - lived transuranium elements",
    "was discussed in  @xcite .            in authors opinion",
    ", all the above - presented facts point unambiguously to the running of the artificially initiated intense processes of nucleosynthesis and transmutation of chemical elements in the microvolume of the target substance undergone to the impact compression to superhigh densities .",
    "the key fact is , undoubtedly , the appearance of chemical elements , which were absent in the composition of the initial materials of targets and accumulating screens ( the structural details of the experimental chamber which participated in the process of explosion ) , in the explosion products . the justification of this fact is the main goal of the present work .",
    "to solve the posed problem , we used such methods of quantitative determination of the element composition of a substance as xepma and gdms .",
    "the studies based on xepma were carried out on an x - ray remma102 microanalyzer ( selmi , sumy , ukraine ) equipped with two wavelength dispersion x - ray spectrometers and one energy - dispersion x - ray spectrometer [ with a si(li ) detector ] .",
    "spectra were registered at a 35-kev accelerating voltage of the electron beam , a probe current of 0.1 na , and a residual pressure of @xmath7pa in the specimen chamber .",
    "the range of energies registered by an energy - dispersion spectrometer was 0.9  30kev , the energy resolution on the line mnk@xmath8 at the counting rate up to 1000pulse / sec was 150ev , and the typical time of the registration of spectra was 200  400sec .",
    "for the quantitative analysis , we used a standard computer program for the calculation of the concentrations of elements developed by the firm - producer of the device ( selmi ) .    to analyze the element composition",
    ", we used a high - sensitivity glow - discharge mass spectrometer ( with ar plasma ) vg  9000 ( vg elemental , uk ) .",
    "the current and voltage of discharge were , respectively , 1.8ma and 1.1kv . as a holder",
    ", we used a cell for plane specimens without cooling which ensures the analyzed region diameter to be 5 mm .",
    "the residual pressures in the specimen chamber and in the spectrometer were , respectively , at most @xmath9 and @xmath10pa .",
    "the ion beam was accelerated by a voltage of 8kv .",
    "the spectrometer possesses the range of analyzed masses 1  250 , and its mass resolution @xmath11 at the half - height of the cu mass - peak is at the level of 7000  9000 . for the quantitative analysis",
    ", we used a standard computer program for the calculation of the concentrations of elements developed by the firm - producer of the device ( vg  elemental ) .    in the present work , we studied the accumulating cu screens in both the initial state and after the deposition of the explosion products on them ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_est01 ] , b ) .",
    "in fact , a screen served as a substrate .",
    "the explosion products were deposited on one of its surfaces as a layer which possessed a weakly pronounced relief and was characterized by the axial symmetry . in the central part of an accumulating screen , we can see an area in the form of a pit of @xmath12 m in depth relative to the screen surface and about @xmath13 mm in diameter ( fig .",
    "[ fig_est01 ] , b , and [ fig_est06 ] ) .",
    "its formation was caused by the entrainment of the screen material as a result of the explosion of a target .",
    "accumulating screens were used to be as - received , i.e. , they were not undergone , prior to the analysis , to any damaging cleaning procedures or those changing their composition . as materials for targets in the present study ( wires of 0.5 mm in diameter ;",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig_est01 ] , a ) , we chose cu , pb , and ag .",
    "for the solution of special tasks , we manufactured assemblies or `` sandwiches '' gathered from 2030 accumulating screens closely fitting one another . in this case , we carried out the analysis on the lateral side of an assembly , i.e. , on the edges of accumulating screens .",
    "such a structure of specimens and the analysis scheme guarantee a sufficient averaging over inhomogeneities of the composition of materials of the very accumulating screens and over those of the explosion products .",
    "we note that a homogeneous specimen was necessary for the correct application of such a destructive method of analysis as gdms , in which the registration of the ion currents of various chemical elements ( isotopes ) was implemented by the successive scheme .",
    "the studies of the composition of products of the explosion of targets , the determination of chemical elements appeared due to the explosion , and the estimation of the number of atoms of such chemical elements were carried out at the laboratory beginning from the first stages of the project .",
    "the objects of these studies were the layer formed by the explosion products deposited on an accumulating screen or the layer remained in the target crater after the explosion .",
    "at first , we believe that local methods of analysis are most suitable for studying these objects .",
    "indeed , the chemical elements which are contained in trace amounts in microobjects can be easily detected by local methods and , at the same time , be beyond the detection limit of even very sensitive integral methods .",
    "however , further , the necessity to use also integral methods of analysis becomes obvious . by using namely integral methods for the comparison of the composition of a whole accumulating screen prior to and after the explosion of a target and by considering the composition of the target material transferred on the accumulating screen",
    ", we can prove that the appearance of chemical elements in the explosion products which were absent in perceptible quantities in the initial materials of both the target and accumulating screen is the result of nucleosynthesis rather than that of their redistribution from the bulk of the accumulating screen or target .    at the same time , we note that even if the use of integral methods solves the posed problem on the whole , their results do not include completely the results derived by local methods . on the one hand ,",
    "local methods give the important information as for the abundance area of newly appeared chemical elements and the character of their distribution there . on the other one",
    ", the comparison of the estimations of a required quantity which were derived by different methods supplementing one another seems to be very interesting and useful .    on the xepma - based determination of the number of atoms of the chemical elements appeared on an accumulating screen as a result of the target explosion , we took pure copper ( cu , 99.99 mass % ) as the material of both the target and accumulating screen . as an example",
    ", we consider the study of the surface layer of accumulating screen no .",
    "the estimation of the number of atoms of the foreign chemical elements ( except for cu ) was realized in two stages . at first",
    ", we counted the number of atoms in the particles lying on the screen surface and then in the enriched @xmath14m - thick surface layer of the matrix ; the values derived in this way then were summed .",
    "the indicated thickness of the enriched surface layer of the matrix was evaluated from the data on the profiles of concentrations through depth of accumulating screens by sims .",
    "below we describe the procedure and results of the first stage .",
    "the scheme is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_est02 ] .",
    "an analyzed area was a raster ( a square ) of @xmath15 m in size . on it",
    ", we counted the number of all particles , analyzed their composition with an sharp probe , and determined the number of atoms for each foreign chemical element at each particle .",
    "then the analyzed area was shifted by a step equal to its side length along one of the lines where the analysis was performed .",
    "such lines formed an angle of @xmath16 with one another ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_est02 ] ) . having performed this procedure , we registered 417 spectra derived on different particles . by virtue of the axial symmetry",
    ", we assumed that all the lines of analysis are equivalent and total analyzed area along them is representative for the whole accumulating screen .",
    "we estimated the total number of particles on the whole accumulating screen surface as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are , respectively , the total area of the accumulating screen and the total area of the analyzed region , and @xmath20 is the total number of the analyzed particles .",
    "we determined the numbers @xmath21 of atoms of the @xmath22-th foreign chemical element in the @xmath23-th particle .",
    "then we calculated the mean number of atoms of the @xmath22-th foreign chemical element per particle by the formula @xmath24    with regard for eq .",
    "[ eq02 ] , we were able to estimate the total number of atoms of the _ i_-th foreign chemical element contained in the particles on the whole accumulating screen surface as @xmath25    the values derived as the result of processing the spectra are given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    ".[table1]numbers of atoms of the foreign chemical elements contained in all particles placed on the whole surface of accumulating screen no",
    ". 5094 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     by using the procedure described above , we calculated the total mass of all the atoms of foreign chemical elements formed as the result of the nucleosynthesis and presented in the volume of the analyzed region of the screen , @xmath26 and their total number @xmath27    we note that this number of atoms was synthesized in two series of experiments since the nucleosynthesis products were applied on both sides of each accumulating screen .",
    "hence , in the performed experiments , we registered @xmath28 synthesized atoms on an accumulating screen in the area of 5 mm in diameter which is positioned in the central region .",
    "their mass @xmath29    as for nucleons contained in the amount of foreign atoms equal to eq .",
    "[ eq44 ] , their number @xmath30    the relative error of the measured values is in the limits of 1020% . comparing eq .",
    "[ eq45 ] and eq .",
    "[ eq25 ] , we note that the mass of regenerated atoms per explosion is almost the same for pb and ag targets , but their number is considerably less for ag targets ( see eq .  [ eq44 ] and eq .  [ eq26 ] ) . this fact indicates that the explosion of an ag target generates , on the average , the atoms of heavier chemical elements .",
    "we also present the mass of ag transferred from the target onto the analyzed region as the result of one explosion : @xmath31    unfortunately , we did not perform measurements on the edge of the `` sandwich '' in the last experiment , because we did not attach any special significance to them at that time .",
    "the results of measurements gave small numbers of the atoms of foreign chemical elements and seemed to be unconvincing for the justification of the running of the nucleosynthesis reactions upon the explosion of a target .",
    "therefore , basing on these results , we can not calculate and present the values characterizing the amount of the regenerated substance deposited on the whole accumulating screen .",
    "however , in view of the absence of separation of chemical elements upon the dispersion of a target substance , we estimated the mass of all the synthesized atoms contained in the mass removed from the target @xmath32    their number @xmath33    finally , for this experiment , the parameter of efficiency of the process of transformation of the target substance in terms of mass is @xmath34    comparing values eqs .",
    "[ eq50 ] and [ eq37 ] , we emphasize the lower efficiency of the process of transformation for a silver target .    by summarizing ,",
    "we note that three independent experiments which were performed by two methods ( the first method is local , and the second is highly sensitive integral ) established the fact of the appearance of foreign chemical elements in products of the explosion of a solid target . we have demonstrated that these atoms are the products of a nuclear transformation of the target substance subjected to the action of a superintense impact compression .",
    "the estimates of the amounts of the substance formed due to the nuclear transformation well agree with one another .",
    "the main results and conclusions concerning the experimental investigations of the explosion - induced destruction of solid targets subjected to the compression up to superhigh densities , which were performed by xepma and gdms in the present work are as follows .",
    "* by the example of three independent analyzes performed by xepma and gdms , we have demonstrated the fact of discovery of the atoms of foreign chemical elements in products of the explosion of a solid target .",
    "prior to the explosion , these elements did not belong to the materials of the target and screen ( the structural details of the experimental chamber which participated in the process of explosion ) .",
    "we have shown that their origination is not related to the processes of deposition from the residual atmosphere of the vacuum chamber or to the transfer from the shell walls ( the structural details which were present in the experimental chamber but did not participate in the process of explosion ) but is the result of a nuclear transformation of the target substance due to the impact compression up to superhigh densities .",
    "* by direct measurements , we determined the amounts of the nucleosynthesis products deposited on accumulating screens in the experiments with copper , lead , and silver targets .",
    "their total mass and the total number of their atoms are , respectively , @xmath35 mg and @xmath36 . the estimates of the amount of a substance formed as the result of a nuclear transformation which were derived by different methods are in good agreement with one another . * we have investigated the distribution of the nucleosynthesis products deposited on the accumulating screen and shown that they are present as microparticles and films in the surface layer of about @xmath37 m in thickness . moreover ,",
    "their overwhelming part is positioned in the central region of the screen , about 5 mm in diameter .",
    "their concentration drops significantly towards the screen periphery .",
    "* we have shown that no separation of chemical elements occurs in the explosion products deposited on accumulating screens upon the dispersion of a target substance .",
    "* we have determined the quantitative characteristics of the efficiency for the process of nuclear transformation of a target substance .",
    "for example , the fractions of the regenerated mass of a target participated in the explosion are 13 and 10% for the pb and ag targets , respectively ."
