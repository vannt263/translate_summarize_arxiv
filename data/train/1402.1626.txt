    "similarly , the correspondence with quantum integrable systems proposed in @xcite hints for a connection between the standard matrix models methods ( such as loop equations @xcite and collective field theory @xcite ) and the mayer cluster expansion @xcite . the latter is a statistical physics technique employed in @xcite to treat the gauge theory partition functions .",

    "] however , the results obtained in @xcite are not directly applicable to susy gauge theories .",
    "the goal of this paper is to extend some of these results to a larger class of models relevant to the gauge / integrability correspondence .",
    "more precisely , the models considered here are defined as @xmath6 they will be studied in the limit @xmath3 , with a @xmath7 a sum of two terms : @xmath8 the function @xmath9 presents two single poles at @xmath10 with residue @xmath11 . on the other hand",

    "the parameter @xmath0 is assumed to have a small positive imaginary part , and integrations in [ def_cz ] are contour integrals over the real axis .",

    "the presence of @xmath9 was neglected in @xcite , and this particular case may be recovered by setting @xmath16 . in the limit @xmath3 , the poles of @xmath9 pinch the integration contour , drastically changing the behavior of the model . physically , @xmath9 gives rise to a strong integration at short distance @xmath17 , which can no longer be treated perturbatively as @xmath18 becomes of order @xmath19 .",
    "instanton partition functions of @xmath1 @xmath20 gauge theories reduces after localization to coupled one - dimensional integrals of the form [ def_cz ] with @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this computation is regularized by considering the gauge theories on the @xmath2-background which depends on two equivariant deformation parameters @xmath22 . the euclidean background @xmath23 is recovered in the limit @xmath24 .",
    "connections with quantum integrable systems appear when @xmath25 is sent to zero while keeping @xmath26 finite @xcite .",
    "this limit is now referred as the nekrasov - shatashvili ( ns ) limit . under the identification @xmath27",
    ", it coincides with the limit where the kernel becomes close to one considered here .",
    "the remaining deformation parameter @xmath26 appears in the definition of the function @xmath12 .",
    "its expression depends on the matter content of the gauge theory .",
    "it is given below in the limit @xmath28 for @xmath1 super - yang - mills ( sym ) with fundamental flavors , and @xmath29 with an adjoint hypermultiplet of mass @xmath30 , @xmath31 let us also mention that setting @xmath32 while keeping @xmath21 , we recover the model proposed by j. hoppe s in @xcite , and further studied in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the first part ,",
    "we focus on the grand - canonical model and show that the free energy at first order in @xmath0 takes the form of an on - shell effective action . for @xmath21",
    ", we recover the action proposed in @xcite , and the corresponding equations of motion take the form of a tba - like relation . after a brief reminder on bethe equations and thermodynamical bethe ansatz ( tba ) , the identification between the free energy and the yang - yang functional is done . in the second section , we consider the associated canonical model .",
    "it is shown that the previous results can be derived from a confinement hypothesis for the eigenvalues of this model .",
    "we further study the limit @xmath33 and recover the collective field action of a dyson gas @xcite .",
    "eventually , we compare our results to the alternative approach based on the expression of instanton partition functions as sum over young tableaux .",
    "appendices gather the most technical details .    _",
    "as the present paper was in preparation , we received the preprint @xcite where similar results are derived for nekrasov partition functions .",
    "however , the method presented here is different from the one employed in @xcite , and we believe it is interesting in its own right . _",
    "the mayer cluster expansion provides an expression of the grand - canonical partition function [ def_cz ] as a sum over clusters .",
    "these clusters consist of a set of vertices connected by at most one link . to each cluster",
    "is associated a set of coupled integrals , with a measure @xmath34 at each vertex @xmath35 and a kernel @xmath36 for each link @xmath37 . taking the logarithm",
    "reduces the summation to connected clusters , and the free energy writes @xcite @xmath38 we denoted @xmath39 the connected clusters with @xmath40 vertices , and @xmath41 ( resp .",
    "@xmath42 ) their set of vertices ( resp .",
    "the symmetry factor @xmath43 takes into account the possibilities of re - arranging the vertices , it is the cardinal of the group of automorphisms that preserve the cluster @xmath39 . since @xmath44 is a sum of two terms @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the previous cluster expansion can be re - written as a sum over clusters @xmath47 with two types of links , referred as p- and g - links @xcite , @xmath48 with the shortcut notation @xmath49 .",
    "let us emphasize that clusters @xmath47 have the same structure as the previous clusters @xmath39 , but with links bearing an additional label p or g. this labeling modify the symmetry factors , @xmath50 because automorphisms must preserve the edges labels .",
    "the set of edges @xmath51 is obviously the direct union of the sets @xmath52 and @xmath53 of p- and g - links respectively .      in order to compute @xmath54 at the leading order in @xmath0 , we need to determine the structure and order of clusters that give the minimal contribution for each term of the @xmath55-expansion .",
    "such clusters will be referred shortly as minimal clusters. our strategy is to work recursively on the number of links .",
    "connected clusters with the minimal number of links at fixed number of vertices have a tree structure .",
    "we will show that trees with @xmath40 vertices are of order @xmath56 , and then discuss the possibility to add either g- or p - links . adding",
    "a link can not decrease the order in @xmath0 , and we conclude that minimal clusters are of the order of the trees , i.e. @xmath56 .",
    "it implies that @xmath54 defined in [ sum_clusters ] is of order one .",
    "clusters made of g - links were considered in @xcite .",
    "each g - link brings a factor @xmath0 : g - trees are of order @xmath57 , and all g - clusters having cycles are sub - dominants .",
    "trees made of p - links have integrals that are also of order @xmath56 .",
    "at this order , they can be computed recursively , this is done in appendix .",
    "their contribution only depends on the number @xmath40 of vertices , and read @xmath58 trees involving both p- and g - links can be constructed recursively starting from a g - tree or a p - tree , and adding a number of vertices with g- or p - links . adding g - links to a p - tree ( or a mixed tree ) will obviously bring a new factor @xmath0 for each link .",
    "adding p - links to g - trees ( or mixed trees ) is similar to adding p - links to p - trees ( see section of the appendix ) , and also brings a factor @xmath0 per link .",
    "thus , any tree with @xmath40 vertices is of order @xmath56 .",
    "any cluster can be build from a tree by adding p- or g - links . adding a g - link always cost a factor @xmath0 .",
    "it implies that @xmath45-links can not belong to the cycles of minimal clusters .",
    "otherwise they could be removed , leading to a connected cluster of strictly smaller order . naively , adding a p - link brings a factor @xmath59 . but kernel residues are proportional to @xmath60 , reducing the degree to @xmath61 which is still subleading . however , there is a specific case where adding a p - link is costless : when the vertices @xmath62 and @xmath63 between which the p - link is inserted are already connected by a path of p - links , thus forming a p - cycle .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that this occurs by computing the integral associated to the first diagrams , such as the triangle , for a simple potential . in this case , the additional p - link is costless because if @xmath62 and @xmath63 are related through a path of p - links , taking the residues of the kernel poles along this path leads to the relation @xmath64 , with @xmath65 an integer .",
    "the additional p - link is then evaluated at a fixed distance @xmath66 which is of order @xmath67 .",
    "let us emphasize that this phenomenon can not happen with g - links because @xmath13 is finite .",
    "note also that if the path between @xmath62 and @xmath63 had involved a g - link , the relation @xmath64 would no longer holds , and the cluster with additional p - link would be subleading .",
    "it is not possible to obtain a negative power of @xmath0 by adding a p - link , and we conclude that minimal clusters are of order @xmath56 .    to summarize , minimal clusters have the structure depicted in figure , with g - links connecting sets of vertices related by p - links . cycles involve p - links but no g - links .      to derive the expression of the grand - canonical free energy at first order in @xmath0",
    ", we employ the technique presented in @xcite .",
    "this method relies on generating functions of rooted clusters . rooting a cluster @xmath47 into @xmath68 consists in marking the vertex @xmath62 , such that it is left invariant under preserving automorphisms ( @xmath69 ) , and that its associated integration variable @xmath70 is fixed . with a slight abuse of notation , this integration variable",
    "will also be denoted @xmath62 .",
    "the generating function of rooted clusters is defined as @xmath71 this expansion of @xmath72 as a sum over rooted clusters @xmath68 involves both p- and g - links . in order to treat separately the action of g and p kernels ,",
    "it is useful to introduce two additional generating functions , denoted @xmath73 and @xmath74 , by constraining the root @xmath62 to be tied to other vertices only through p - links and g - links respectively .",
    "all these generating functions are of order @xmath19 in @xmath0 .",
    "we have defined three functions @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and three relations among them will be derived : [ eom1 ] , [ eom_yg ] and [ eom_y ] . in the next subsection , these functions will be used to express the free energy at small @xmath0 .",
    "the limit @xmath3 brings two main simplifications at the basis of our derivation : the tree structure for g - links , responsible for [ eom1 ] and [ eom_yg ] , and the short range of p - interactions leading to [ eom_y ] .    before giving the derivation of the three identities , we need to introduce some terminology .",
    "vertices connected to the root by a single link are called _",
    "direct vertices_. we further distinguish _ direct g - vertices _ and _ direct p - vertices _ by the type of link between the vertex and the root .",
    "vertices related to the root through a path involving only p - links are called _ fixed vertices_.",
    "this set includes all the direct p - vertices .",
    "finally , the _ descendants _ of a vertex are the vertices connected to this vertex through a path that do not involve the root .",
    "the various types of vertices of a rooted clusters are highlighted in the figure .",
    "the simplest identity among @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 is a factorization property at first order due to the fact that @xmath45-links can not form cycles in minimal clusters , @xmath78 indeed , this identity expresses the fact that rooted clusters can be decomposed into two disconnected sub - cluster , as shown in figure .",
    "the first sub - cluster involves the root , direct g - vertices and their descendant , whereas the second one contains the root , fixed vertices and their descendants .",
    "the identity [ eom1 ] will be used to eliminate @xmath76 , allowing to work only with @xmath75 and @xmath77 .",
    "the second identity is very similar to the one derived in @xcite for @xmath16 .",
    "it follows from the fact that the root in minimal clusters of @xmath74 can be connected to @xmath30 direct g - vertices , each being the root of a new cluster formed by their descendants .",
    "these new clusters are not connected to each other , otherwise we would form a cycle containing a g - link which would be subdominant . at first order ,",
    "contributions of these clusters factorize , leading to @xmath79 the symmetry factor @xmath80 takes into account the possibility to permute the direct g - vertices .    to establish the last identity , we focus on the minimal clusters contributing to @xmath81 .",
    "the set of fixed vertices form together with the root a rooted sub - cluster involving only @xmath46-links , that we denote @xmath82 where @xmath40 is the number of fixed vertices plus the root @xmath62 .",
    "taking apart the p - links of @xmath82 , each fixed vertex becomes the root of a sub - cluster formed by itself , its direct g - vertices and their descendants .",
    "these sub - clusters are now disconnected , otherwise a cycle involving a g - link would appear .",
    "it implies again a factorization property at leading order , @xmath83 the next step is to argue that the factors @xmath84 within the integrals can be approximated by @xmath74 and taken out of the integrations .",
    "this seems reasonable because the kernel poles fix the relative value of the variables @xmath85 with respect to the root @xmath62 as @xmath86 with @xmath87 a finite integer . in the limit @xmath3 , it is possible to approximate the residue factor @xmath88 with @xmath74",
    "however , it turns out that this way of reasoning is too simple as it overlooks the contributions from the poles of @xmath84 .",
    "these contributions are not negligible and even play a major role in the proper arguments given in appendix .",
    "these arguments heavily rely on the hypothesis that the potential @xmath14 has only pole singularities within the contour of integration .",
    "it also requires that the kernel @xmath45 preserves this property under convolutions .",
    "both requirements are satisfied in the application to instanton partition functions of @xmath1 susy gauge theories . replacing @xmath84 with @xmath74 in [ ap_exp ]",
    ", we obtain @xmath89 the coefficients @xmath90 will turn out to be independent of @xmath62 . they can be related to the following integrals , @xmath91 where we identified @xmath92 . to derive this relation ,",
    "we apply the mayer expansion to the integrals @xmath93 . in the product , terms with @xmath94 act as a potential for the @xmath95 variables @xmath96 .",
    "but we can take an alternate point of view and consider the expansion of the full product with @xmath40 variables over rooted clusters with root @xmath97 .",
    "this expansion contains terms associated to disconnected clusters .",
    "such terms factorize into connected part contributions .",
    "but contributions of clusters with no root vanishes because of the absence of poles in the potential .",
    "] where @xmath98 is a cluster of @xmath65 vertices and with only p - links .",
    "poles in the kernel fixes the relative values of the variable @xmath85 in terms of one variable @xmath99 , but there is no way to fix the remaining variable .",
    "this last integral is vanishing , due to the zero volume property [ zero_volume ] . ]",
    "thus , only connected clusters remain , they can be identified to the clusters @xmath82 considered above , and @xmath100 the integer @xmath101 is the number of configurations ( i.e. labeled clusters ) producing the same cluster @xmath82 . by definition ,",
    "the symmetry factor @xmath102 is the number of labellings of @xmath95 vertices ( the root is fixed ) divided by the number of equivalent configurations @xmath101 , and thus @xmath103 .",
    "the integral @xmath93 is a polynomial in @xmath104 of degree @xmath105 times @xmath106 , starting with the term since @xmath107 , we have shown that minimal clusters with p - cycles are of order @xmath56 ] @xmath109 this expression is derived in appendix . for the specific value @xmath21 relevant to nekrasov partition functions",
    ", we have the simple result @xmath110 also obtained in appendix . for general @xmath104",

    "blue vertices are dressed by g - links ( in dashed ) , and related to each other with p - links ( in plain ) .",
    "they form meta - vertices , drawn as black circles.,width=302 ]    it remains to relate the free energy to the generating functions @xmath75 and @xmath77 .",
    "as can be seen in figure , the minimal clusters that contribute to the free energy at first order have a tree - structure in terms of g - links .",
    "we call meta - vertices the sets of vertices tied together by p - links . at large distance ,",
    "figure resemble a tree with vertices replaced by meta - vertices .",
    "thanks to this tree structure , the basso - sever - vieira formula @xcite still applies . indeed , the combinatorial argument given in the proof @xcite ( appendix a ) for the case @xmath16 can be re - used for the general case since it is possible to associate uniquely a g - link to each meta - vertex .",
    "the inner structure of meta - vertices play no role in our discussion , and the symmetry factors are such that the free energy [ sum_clusters_ii ] is again given by a difference of two terms , @xmath114 this equation is graphically represented in figure . in the rhs ,",
    "the second term @xmath115 is obtained by attaching two rooted clusters through a g - link . since the roots belong to two different meta - vertices , @xmath116 to obtain the term @xmath117 , focus on a meta - vertex .",
    "taking apart its p - links , the inner vertices ( in blue on figure ) are the roots of disconnected sub - clusters with direct vertices of type g only .",
    "it means that they should be dressed with @xmath74 , and the first term is @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the connected cluster with only p - links associated to a meta - vertex .",
    "one possibility to compute this expression is to again approximate @xmath120 and evaluate the remaining integrals , but the justifications may be tedious . fortunately , it is possible to make use of a result demonstrated in @xcite ( appendix b ) which relates the symmetry factors of rooted clusters with non - rooted ones , @xmath121 in this formula , the summation is over the class of equivalence of rooted clusters obtained by rooting a vertex @xmath122 of the original cluster @xmath119 .",
    "this identity allows to single out one of the integration variable , and rewrite @xmath117 as @xmath123 we recognize the integrals that appeared in the expression [ ap_exp ] of @xmath81 . using the same trick to evaluate them , we get @xmath124 where we introduced the primitive @xmath125 at @xmath21 , @xmath110 and @xmath126 is equal to the dilogarithm function @xmath127 .",
    "the additional factor @xmath128 necessary to transform @xmath129 into @xmath126 , and thus generate the @xmath127 at @xmath21 , comes from the choice of a root among the @xmath40 inner vertices of a meta - vertex .",

    "the cauchy determinant formula @xmath325 allows to expand @xmath93 on the permutations of the symmetric group @xmath326 , @xmath327 these integrals are non - vanishing only if the permutation is a cycle of maximal length @xmath40 .",
    "indeed , permutations can be decomposed into cycles and the integral factorizes into cycle contributions .",
    "cycles of length @xmath30 that do not contain the fixed variable @xmath328 give , after re - labeling the variables , the contribution ( @xmath329 ) @xmath330 which is vanishing , according to [ zero_volume ] .",
    "thus , only cycles of maximal length @xmath40 remain .",
    "there are @xmath331 such cycles , and their signature is @xmath332 . by re - labeling the variables , we easily show that all these cycles give the same contribution , which can be evaluated by choosing @xmath333 modulo @xmath40 .",

    "nevertheless , many results obtained in @xcite does not require a strong assumption on the form of the kernel @xmath44 , and easily generalize to our case .",
    "they are summarized in this appendix .",
    "the action of @xmath337 on the grand - canonical free energy @xmath338 is a purely combinatorial result that applies for any kernel and potential , @xmath339 introducing generating function of @xmath340-rooted clusters , it can be generalized into @xmath341    the generating functions @xmath75 are related to the grand - canonical densities . introducing the grand canonical vev of an operator @xmath342 , @xmath343 in terms of the canonical vevs , @xmath344 the one - point grand - canonical density is defined as @xmath345 it is simply related to @xmath72 as @xmath346 .",
    "a similar result holds for the 2-points density , @xmath347 the relations of this subsection are valid at all order in @xmath0 .",
    "the relations between grand - canonical and canonical ensemble derived in @xcite are obtained from the inversion [ invert_laplace ] of the discrete laplace transform . as such , they are not model dependent and still valid in our case .",
    "thus , at large @xmath4 the canonical free energy is related to the grand - canonical one through the legendre transform @xmath348\\simeq\\frac1\\e\\fgc(q,\\e)-n\\log q,\\quad\\text{when}\\quad q\\p_q\\fgc(q,\\e)=n\\e,\\ ] ] where free energies are defined as @xmath349 in the scaling limit @xmath350 with @xmath351 fixed , this relation becomes at first order @xmath352 where @xmath353 and @xmath218 are conjugated variables , and @xmath354 a similar relation also applies to densities at leading order in @xmath0 : at one - point , @xmath355 and at two - points , @xmath356"
