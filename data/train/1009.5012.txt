    "we consider an infrastructure wireless network employing the ieee 802.11 dcf mechanism and carrying tcp - controlled file downloads . in this paper",
    ", we study analytical models for evaluating the performance of tcp - controlled downloads with non zero round trip propagation delays . in the literature",
    ", many works address the analysis of tcp flows in wireless networks .",
    "however very few consider non negligible round trip propagation delays in their models .",
    "our approach can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , we consider only two nodes in the network -an ap and an sta .",
    "we obtain expressions for ap and sta throughput in the absence of propagation delays .",
    "we consider that all the wireless medium specific proprieties of the system are encapsulated in these expressions .",
    "next , we include the effect of rtpd by using a closed queueing network .",
    "we validate our model by comparison with various simulated quantities , such as mean number of packets in the ap , sta and in flight .",
    "our numerical results of model matches with maximum error of 1.87 % error .",
    "outline of the paper : section [ sec : related_work ] outlines related work . in section [ sec : system_model ]",
    "we we summarize out modelling assumption with the system model . in section [ sec : analysis ] we provide analysis for throughputs in case of two contending nodes . in section [ sec : evaluation ] , we validate model by comparing with the results obtained from the qualnet network simulator . in section [ sec : conclusion ]",
    "we discuss the results and conclude the paper .",
    "numerous models and analyses have been proposed for wireless networks with tcp - controlled traffic , but very few consider propagation delays . in @xcite , rtt is considered for modelling the tcp traffic in wlan , but the authors interest was in providing analysis supporting the service differentiation feature in 802.11e .",
    "the authors ensured fairness among tcp data packets and tcp acks by utilizing the different access categories in 802.11e , and their analysis exploited this fairness to show that service differentiation is possible .",
    "a detailed analysis and modelling of the aggregate throughput of tcp flows in wlans for a single rate access point is given in @xcite and @xcite by assuming negligible or zero round trip time ( rtt ) .",
    "similarly , the performance of the ap is evaluated in the multi rate case in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however these works also ignore the rtt .",
    "an extension of this model in @xcite considers two rates of association with long file uploads from stas to a local server .",
    "the multirate case is considered in @xcite , and arbitrary tcp windows are allowed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite present another analysis of a scenario of tcp - controlled upload and download file transfers , with udp traffic .",
    "they ignored the rtt effect on the behaviour of the network .",
    "the letter @xcite gives the average value analysis of tcp performance with upload and download traffic with out considering rtt .",
    "in @xcite , a finite buffer ap with tcp traffic in both upload and download directions is analysed with delayed and undelayed ack cases .",
    "they consider server system located on the ethernet to which the ap is connected and hence number of packets `` in flight '' outside the wlan is ignored .",
    "@xcite and @xcite provide models in finite load conditions by approximating the packet arrival precess at the stas as a poisson process .",
    "@xcite extended saturated model proposed in @xcite to non saturated model by introducing a term for probability of queue being empty .",
    "@xcite models every sta with m / g/1 queue considers the propagation delay as the delay in transmission of packet in wireless medium , and not the time spent in reaching the wlan from the server .",
    "@xcite provides an analysis for a given number of stas and maximum tcp receive window size by using the well known @xmath0 persistent model proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , both @xcite and @xcite consider no rtt effect in the traffic .",
    "@xcite considers http traffic .",
    "a queuing model is proposed to compute the mean session delay in the presence of short - lived tcp flows and the impact of tcp maximum congestion window size on this delay is studied .",
    "the analysis is extended to consider delayed acks asw well .",
    "we consider a wlan in which an sta is associated with an ap as shown in figure [ fig : ap_1sta ] .",
    "we consider long - lived tcp connections having bulk data to send .",
    "that is , we focus on large file transfers .",
    "the server is far away from the lan .",
    "hence , there is propagation delay between the ap and the server .",
    "every packet experiences this delay .",
    "figure [ fig : ap_1sta ] shows the direction of tcp flow .",
    "the sta has a single tcp connection to download long files from the server .",
    "further , because of bulk transfer scenario , we can assume that the tcp flow is in the steady state .",
    "we assume that the application at the receiver reads data from the socket receive buffer at the rate at which it is received from the network .",
    "hence , the tcp ack packets always advertise the maximal tcp receive window size .",
    "therefore , tcp startup transients can be ignored .",
    "also , tcp timeouts do not occur .",
    "the ap and the sta contend for the channel using the dcf mechanism .",
    "we assume that there are no link errors .",
    "packets in the medium are lost only due to collisions between transmission attempts of ap and sta .",
    "further , we assume that all the nodes use the rts - cts mechanism while sending packets , and use basic access to send ack packets .",
    "as soon as the station receives a data packet , it generates an ack packet without any delay and it is enqueued at the mac layer for transmission .",
    "we assume that all the nodes have sufficiently large buffers , so that packets are not lost due to buffer overflow .",
    "because two entities , i.e. , the ap and the sta , are contending for the channel , we can consider probability of attempt as @xmath1 , as in @xcite .",
    "this amounts to assuming that both ap ans sta are backlogged permanently , i.e. , that saturation conditions apply .",
    "current tcp implementations use very large windows ( window scaling option ) , and with these , our assumption is justifiable .",
    "figure [ fig : channel_activity ] shows one possible sample path of events on the wireless channel in the wlan with an ap and an sta .",
    "the random epochs @xmath2 indicate the end of the @xmath3 successful transmission from either the ap or the sta .",
    "let @xmath4 be the time taken by the ap to transmit one packet tcp packet including mac and phy headers .",
    "this can be obtained by using parameter shown in table [ tab : parameter ] .",
    "we have @xmath5 as data transmission follows an rts - cts exchange , the lengths of the rts and cts packets , as well as @xmath6 , are used in    .values of parameters used in analysis and simulation [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]                     in tables [ table : ap_sta_thpt ] and figures [ fig : win_thpt1 ] , [ fig : thpt2 ] , [ fig : nap ] and [ fig : npd ] comparisons between analytical and simulation values are given for 11mbps to illustrate the accuracy of the analytical model .",
    "in this paper we developed a simple analytical framework to obtain accurate closed - form expressions for the performance of the ap and stas with persistent tcp connections in the presence of round trip propagation delay .",
    "we verified the accuracy of the analytical model with the simulation results.we consider that tcp in its steady state , the tcp advertised window is smaller than the tcp congestion window .",
