    "in many branches of the social sciences , game theory has been used to model , predict , and understand interaction of a number of agents subjected to the same rules : games can be anything from auctions to competition , from political elections to social contracts , and from judiciary to matrimonial trouble .",
    "perhaps the simplest useful class of games are 2x2 games : interactions between two players , each choosing one of two actions . despite their simple appearance , many phenomena of game theory",
    "can already be observed in this basic form : `` the players act rationally , but the consequences are often bizarre , which makes application to a world of intelligent men and ludicrous outcomes appropriate '' @xcite .    the contrast between the same 2x2 games when they are played once and when they are played in series , both in simplicity of solution concepts and in their strategic implications , led to a wide range of social phenomena being rationalized : the same egoistic players who exhibit rational yet ( bizarrely ) anti - social behavior in once - off encounters can be driven to more cooperative actions in iterated games .",
    "consequently , the theory of 2x2 games has often been used as a study of social cooperation @xcite .    in a recent paper by william press and freeman dyson @xcite",
    ", the class of zero determinant ( zd ) strategies for iterated 2x2 games was discovered , promising to beat rationalistic agents on their own ground : mindful players can exploit pure economic rationality by extorting a larger payoff share for themselves .",
    "the aim of this present paper is to study those strategies , which were believed to threaten the more cooperative nuances in game theory .",
    "how , and under what conditions do zd strategies work ?",
    "can they indeed outperform the intuitive and conventional behavior of tit for tat , as has been claimed ?",
    "how can we gain from this new and mischievous knowledge ? and how can the less mischievous protect themselves ?    this chapter provides a minimal context to understand the foundations zd strategies stand on .",
    "all analysis in this paper strives to be as general as possible ; however , to facilitate demonstration and to provide meaningful examples , the first section will introduce four of the most common 2x2 games , noting some of their applications .",
    "when such stage games are iterated , their dynamic changes substantially",
    ": the following sections thus introduce the theory of iterated 2x2 games , and one of its landmarks , the folk theorem .",
    "having seen that predictions about iterated games are less clear - cut than their once - off pendants , a short summary of simulated tournaments between different strategies in iterated games will complete this chapter .",
    "in [ chap : zdstrat ] , i analyze the mechanisms and implications of zd strategies . after a thorough recapitulation of their derivation ,",
    "they be will generalized for more general games and their behavior will be studied both analytically and numerically .",
    "finally , i will provide a number of response options and try to integrate zero determinant strategies with classic game theory .",
    "in [ chap : evolcomp ] these results are utilized for a brief digression to evolutionary game theory , discussing potential applications of zd strategies as well as their chances of success .",
    "finally , a short commentary will conclude this paper . in the appendices ,",
    "i provide technical details for my results .",
    "four of the most commonly studied 2x2 games will serve as examples in this paper : the prisoners dilemma , stag hunt , the game of chicken , and the battle of the sexes .",
    "the first three of those are symmetric games , which means that they can all be represented in a symmetric payoff matrix ( see [ tab : symmetricgame ] ) : this reflects the fact that players have the same preferences over game outcomes , as defined by their own and their opponent s move .",

    "one player , @xmath2 , chooses an action on the table s rows ( hence she is called row - player ) , while the other , @xmath3 , chooses an action on the table s columns ( hence he is called column - player ) .",
    "if the row - player chooses her action @xmath4 and the column - player chooses his action @xmath5 , for instance , the outcome of the game shall be referred to as @xmath6 .",
    "payoffs for player @xmath7 are formally defined as a function giving a score for each possible outcome : @xmath8 . in the example of the symmetric game ,",
    "payoffs for @xmath9 are then @xmath10 : the cells in [ tab : symmetricgame ] show payoffs @xmath11 for each of the possible game outcomes .",
    "players are assumed to have strongly monotone preferences over payoffs , implying @xmath12 where `` @xmath13 '' is the strong preference relation .",
    "i assume quantitative symmetry in this paper , meaning that symmetry not only holds for ordinal relations between payoffs but rather for the exact payoff values .",
    "that is , @xmath14 .",
    "here , this allows for easier notation without loss of analytic generality .    finally , for completeness , we loosely define : a _ strategy _ @xmath15 of player @xmath16 is a `` plan to choose an action @xmath17 '' .",
    "the payoff function can then be defined over strategies instead of actions : @xmath18 . a _",
    "nash equilibrium _ is a combination of strategies for both players where , given the strategy of the other player , no player would want to change his strategy .",
    "a _ maximin strategy _ is a strategy for player @xmath16 yielding his _ maximin payoff _ @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 signifies player @xmath16 s opponent ) : the highest payoff player @xmath16 can guarantee himself regardless of his opponent s action .. ] in this paper , maximin is always `` pure strategy maximin , '' i.e. restricted to strategies that explicitly define an action @xmath17 . as for notation",

    "the prisoners dilemma ( pd ) is probably the most widely studied game in game theory ; it is characterized by the relations @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in this paper ,",
    "axelrod s canonical payoffs @xcite will be used for numerical analyses , i.e. @xmath33 .",
    "while its original story is built around a federal leniency program , pd is generally treated as a game about cooperation : suppose two parties share a common good .",
    "both parties can choose to either respectfully use that good in moderation ( cooperate , @xmath0 ) , allowing both parties to benefit from it .",
    "or they can claim an unproportional share ( defect , @xmath1 ) , which promises higher returns regardless of their opponent s action .",
    "due to the individual incentive to defect , both parties find themselves in mutual defection , resulting in the shared good being destroyed .",
    "the mechanism of individual incentives favoring a collectively disappointing outcome can be applied to a wide range of phenomena , from free riding to the tragedy of the commons , from the rule of law to pollution .",
    "because of its universal character and its intuitive simplicity , pd s general structure has become paradigmatic to the study of social cooperation : indeed , even contemporary social philosophers continue to rely on its logic @xcite .    because of the incentive to defect regardless of the opponent s action",
    ", pd has a single nash equilibrium , @xmath34 , which is usually called `` mutual defection . ''",
    "the resulting payoffs are also the maximin payoff : @xmath35 .      stag hunt ( sh )",
    "is another game often referred to in the context of cooperation . in sh ,",
    "the following relation holds : @xmath36 . to make the game more interesting for illustrative purposes , i assume @xmath37 .",
    "then two nash equilibria exist in pure strategies : @xmath38 and @xmath34 , where the former is payoff dominant ( players receive higher payoffs ) and the latter is risk dominant ( players do not risk being exploited , for they receive the same payoff regardless of their opponent s action ) .",
    "obviously , the risk dominant nash equilibrium also gives the maximin payoffs , @xmath35 .",
    "additionally , a mixed nash equilibrium exists , where both players choose to play @xmath0 with a certain probability .",
    "when numerical analyses are required , i will use @xmath39 . with these payoffs ,",
    "the mixed nash equilibrium is for both players to choose @xmath40the players are then indifferent between both pure actions .",
    "the game of chicken ( gc ) has been used to study escalating behavior in conflicts and has famously been applied to brinkmanship in nuclear warfare @xcite . in gc ,",
    "payoffs are characterized by @xmath41 . for numerical values ,",
    "i take @xmath42 .    in gc , both players `` dare each other '' to play @xmath1 , but prefer any alternative to @xmath34 ( the worst result where both players `` escalate '' ) .",
    "thus two pure strategy nash equilibria exist , @xmath43 and @xmath9one player will always prefer to back down .",
    "additionally , a mixed nash equilibrium exists ( with payoffs as defined , both players choose @xmath44 ) . in gc ,",
    "the maximin payoff is @xmath45 , the minimum payoff from backing down .      as the most common example of asymmetric games , this paper further studies the battle of the sexes ( bs ) : here the players have different preferences about the game s outcome , yielding a different payoff matrix ( see [ tab : bosgame ] ) .",
    "payoff values satisfy @xmath46 , and i will assume @xmath47 for numerical analyses .",

    "less romantically , their payoffs are [ ... ] '' @xcite ] epitomizes coordination issues between two parties : imagine negotiations over contractual conditions : both parties want the contract to be signed , but both hope to establish their preferred alternatives .",
    "pure strategy nash equilibria thus are @xmath38 and @xmath34 ( successful coordination ) , and a mixed nash equilibrium exists ( with payoffs as defined , both players choose @xmath48 ) .",
    "the maximin payoff is @xmath49 , i.e. failing to coordinate but having claimed the preferred alternative .",
    "many applications of 2x2 stage games are better described when the assumption of once - off encounters is dropped : instead , two players repeatedly play the same game against each other , each time receiving a stage game payoff .",
    "suppose the prisoners dilemma is played repeatedly .",
    "then @xmath50 signifies the iterated game obtained by playing pd @xmath51-times .",
    "let @xmath52 signify the @xmath53-th period of @xmath50 , i.e. the @xmath53-th sequential stage game .",
    "each stage game @xmath52 is the same , except for a history of game outcomes that were already played , and a different number of iterations , @xmath54 , to follow .",
    "both players know this , i.e. they know how many more `` rounds '' they will play , and they recall a history of previous outcomes .",
    "let @xmath55 be such a history of @xmath53 outcomes , signified by the actions @xmath56 in @xmath57 .",
    "this shared knowledge allows both players to condition their action in @xmath52 on the observed history of previous outcomes : their strategies can be understood as functions of history , @xmath58 .",
    "if both players do not know exactly when the sequence of stage game iterations is going to end ( i.e. there is no clear - cut @xmath51 , or the players do nt know its value ) , the iterated game may be analyzed as an infinitely iterated game , @xmath59 , with a certain probability is to mean `` infinitely repeated stage game @xmath60 with common discount rate @xmath61 . '' ] @xmath62 of ending in every period @xcite . under such circumstances ,",
    "no player can ever be certain that he is playing the last round of the iterated game . aside from the history of previous plays ,",
    "every iteration thus presents the same stage game : the probability of the game continuing is always the same .",
    "analysis shows that the clear - cut nash equilibria of stage games are now complemented by a multitude of additional equilibria : this will be demonstrated for the infinitely iterated pd ( ipd  ish , igc , and ibs conversely are the infinitely iterated counterparts of the stage games defined above ) before the more general folk theorem is introduced in the next subsection .",
    "the once - off pd game , where `` mutual defection '' is the only nash equilibrium , is the archetype of rational players and bizarre outcomes .",
    "by contrast , the `` cooperative '' game outcome @xmath38 can be stabilized as nash equilibrium for _ every _ iteration of ipd @xcite ; consider player @xmath3 in one iteration of ipd .",
    "knowing that he will probably continue to play a sequence of games after this one , he will want not only to myopically maximize his payoff in this iteration , but also to consider future payoffs .",
    "his interest in future payoffs , to be precise , will depend on the discount factor @xmath61 , as he will try to maximize the discounted payoff @xmath63 , where    @xmath64    the discount factor simply reduces the attention paid to payoffs from more distant ( and therefore less likely ) iterations .",
    "now assume @xmath2 to play the following grim trigger strategy : play @xmath0 until @xmath3 plays @xmath1 for the first time . then forever continue playing @xmath1 . in every iteration @xmath3",
    "can choose to either receive @xmath51 followed by an infinite series of @xmath65 , or to receive an infinite series of @xmath66 .",
    "if @xmath3 cares enough about future payoffs ( i.e. if @xmath61 is large enough ) , the future cost of reverting to the stage game equilibrium will outweigh the present benefit of defecting , and playing @xmath0 in every iteration will maximize @xmath3 s overall score .",
    "then if @xmath3 decides to play the analogous grim trigger strategy ( @xmath0 until @xmath2 first plays @xmath1 ) , neither player has an incentive to deviate from their strategies , yielding @xmath38 in every iteration of ipd .",
    "this result has been understood as key to social phenomena : even in situations which normally discourage cooperation , such as the tragedy of the commons @xcite as exemplified in ipd , cooperation becomes possible if two players do not know how long they will interact with each other , and if they care enough about future interactions .",
    "the folk theorem generalizes the result that by iterating a stage game infinitely , more nash equilibria are obtained than in the stage game . to be precise ,",
    "applied to 2x2 games , it states that in any infinitely iterated game @xmath67 there exist ( subgame - perfect @xcite ) nash equilibria that yield average stage game payoffs of @xmath11 if the following conditions hold @xcite :    1 .   the stage game @xmath60 has a nash equilibrium yielding payoffs @xmath68 , and @xmath69 for both players @xmath16 .",
    "the probability of the game continuing ( the discount rate ) , @xmath61 , is sufficiently close to 1 .",
    "this ensures that threats about future behavior have a big enough impact on present decision making .",
    "analogous to the pd example above , in any infinitely iterated game a credible threat can be made to fall back to the nash equilibrium yielding payoffs @xmath70 , a worse ( but equilibrium ) outcome for both players .",
    "a grim trigger strategy would thus be along the lines of `` play a combination of stage game actions yielding on average @xmath11 , until an opponent diverts from that combination . then",
    ", continue playing the stage game equilibrium strategy yielding @xmath68 forever after . ''",
    "this result adds a convex set of feasible nash equilibria to the infinitely iterated game : [ fig : folkconvexset ] demonstrates this in the case of ipd .",
    "all strategy combinations yielding payoffs in the blue area can be achieved as equilibrium payoffs in ipd when @xmath61 is large enough .",
    "however , the folk theorem merely states that all combinations in this set _ can _ be achieved as equilibria ; no statement is made about whether such equilibria _ will _ indeed be reached .",
    "infinitely iterated 2x2 games have been used to study a wide range of topics , from social behavior ( e.g. @xcite ) to economic competition ( e.g. @xcite ) and even questions of evolutionary biology ( see e.g. @xcite for the diverse literature ) . the folk theorem gives some indication on why their relatively simple mechanism ( two players , each having only two possible actions ) has sparked so much interest : while it is clear that a whole set of payoffs can generally be achieved as nash equilibrium , it remains unclear which specific point from the set will ensue in a game and which strategies are suited to obtain optimal payoffs when no information is available about one s opponent .",
    "the question therefore is which strategies would be most successful if infinitely iterated games were played `` in the wild . '' in diverse applications , formal analyses as well as computer simulations",
    "are applied to find especially successful strategies , or to understand the dynamics of different populations of strategies ( representing for example cultural conventions , marketing strategies , or biological species ) .    in computer simulations , populations of players using different strategies",
    "are randomly pitted against each other to form a competitive , unpredictable environment .",
    "the most famous of such tournaments , axelrod s first ipd tournament @xcite , showed variations of the so called tit - for - tat strategy ( @xmath71 ) to be particularly successful .",
    "the original @xmath71 strategy plays @xmath0 in the first iteration and then plays whatever move its opponent played last ; much like the grim trigger strategy , @xmath71 can successfully establish cooperative payoffs .    in subsequent tournaments ,",
    "both amateur @xcite and scientific , this result was confirmed , consistently ranking more or less `` cooperative '' strategies similar to @xmath71 or win - stay - loose - shift @xcite among the top strategies in terms of total payoffs : while they can generally be exploited by an opponent primed to do so , they tend to achieve relatively high payoffs both for themselves and for their opponents .",
    "this makes them typical winners in tournaments of strategy zoos when it comes to total payoffs earned , while `` losing '' most individual games against single opponents : while more `` fierce '' strategies can outperform @xmath71 by a small amount , they will receive much smaller payoffs in the fierce battle between themselves , enabling @xmath71 to win by total payoff earned .",
    "these results are confirmed in a wide range of literature ( for an overview , see @xcite ) , and for strategies like @xmath71 it has been established that they can only be beaten by an infinitesimal amount , effectively equalizing their own and their opponent s score .",
    "the well - established success of such intuitive patterns as tit - for - tat and the `` fairness '' they induce contributed to the considerable attention received by a paper recently published by william press and freeman dyson @xcite : they report the discovery of a class of `` simple ultimatum [ strategies ] whereby one player can enforce a unilateral claim to an unfair share of rewards '' @xcite in ipd .",
    "the properties of their zero determinant ( zd ) strategies are this paper s main interest .    in [ sec : generality , sec : gamesasmarkov ] , we follow press and dyson s derivation of zd strategies , expanding on critical points and introducing the notation used in this chapter . interprets press and dyson s main results , which are generalized and illustrated in [ sec : zdparameters ] .",
    "there , concrete strategies are shown for the four games analyzed here , along with results from exemplary gameplay simulations .",
    "the implications for a zd player s opponent are discussed in [ sec : bestresponse ] , where i present conditions for a simple yet effective response to zd strategies . to assess the aptitude of zd strategies in real - world applications , [ sec : zdconvergence ]",
    "analyzes convergence speed .",
    "finally [ sec : zdfolk ] attempts to integrate zd strategies with classical game theoretic approaches .",
    "in [ sec : itgames ] it was assumed that players in an iterated game know the whole history of plays ; however , especially in infinitely iterated games , it appears sensible to assume that players condition their strategy only on a finite subset of recent history ",
    "if this is the case , competing players might use different memory spans : one player who remembers and uses the last 20 outcomes may compete against a particularly forgetful player who can only recall the very last move , and thus only conditions his strategy on the very last outcome .",
    "the strategy that is conditional on the last 20 moves will be called a strategy ; the latter players strategy is a strategy .",
    "note that even a player with long memory might play a strategy , i.e. she might condition her moves on the last outcome only .",
    "zd strategies are a subclass of strategies , i.e. they are conditional only on the last stage game s outcome .",
    "since in their analysis press and dysonpit them against a general strategy , they have to show that this is sufficiently general to cover _ all _ possible opponents , including those who have longer memory",
    ". they do this by showing  somewhat counterintuitively  that the `` shortest memory - player sets the rules of the game '' @xcite : playing any strategy would not yield any advantages over playing another strategy against zd strategies .",
    "this refutes the obvious argument against their analysis , viz . that it fails to cover more intricate opponents .",
    "any memory in excess of the shared memory of both players is irrelevant .",
    "this is due to the simple fact that a strategy player can not apprehend reactions conditioned on a history she forgot already .",
    "thus , to her , even the most intricate strategy will appear to be a strategy : the one obtained by averaging over all outcomes remembered by her opponent but not by her .",
    "if her opponent were to play this averaged - over strategy , she would not notice any difference to the strategy .",
    "since her strategy will thus not be affected by averaging , the relevant gameplay would be equivalent : the distribution over the number of stage game outcomes , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the number of stage game outcomes @xmath74 ( such as @xmath43 , see below ) in the infinitely iterated game , will be exactly the same .",
    "press and dysonpresent an analytical proof ( * ? ? ? * appx 1 ) ; this somewhat counter - intuitive result can further be made plausible by two arguments .",
    "firstly , memory enables strategy patterns , such as `` play @xmath1 if the opponent played @xmath1 twice in a row . ''",
    "if , however , one player s strategy pattern is a sequence longer than his opponent s memory , the pattern length in excess of his opponent s memory will never be noticed by his opponent , and will thus never influence his actions .",
    "secondly , an intuitive objection is that the longer - memory opponent will not know the outcomes to average over before the game begins . while this is true , it is besides the point : after the game , we know that a shorter - memory strategy existed that would have yielded the same gameplay  during the game ,",
    "the players just did not necessarily know which one .",
    "thus , if a strategy is analyzed against another strategy , all possible game outcomes will be considered : all possible strategies that could ever play against a zd strategy _ ex post _ have a corresponding strategy that yields the same payoffs .",
    "therefore , press and dyson s analysis of ipd as a game between two strategies is sufficiently general to cover all possible outcomes in ipd : opponents with longer memory can not `` outplay '' zd strategies .",
    "having established the generality of analysis , this section follows press and dysonin their derivation of zd strategies , expanding on theoretical background .",
    "along with press and dyson , we can without loss of generality describe any infinitely iterated 2x2 game with at least one zd strategy player by the following :    * two players , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . *   both players action sets and the resulting set of possible stage game outcomes as described by @xmath75 , where we have defined @xmath76 , and @xmath77 analogously for notational convenience .",
    "* each player s strategy , which is defined as a vector of conditional probabilities of playing @xmath0 , conditioned on the last stage game outcome ( the `` content '' of each player s ) . since both players decide between @xmath0 and @xmath1 only , the probability of playing @xmath1 is given by @xmath78 .",
    "+ @xmath2 s strategy is @xmath79 where the order of probabilities corresponds to the last game outcome , @xmath80 ( i.e. @xmath81 ) .",
    "likewise , @xmath3 s strategy is @xmath82 where the probabilities correspond to the last game outcome , seen from his perspective , @xmath83 .",
    "thus , @xmath84 .",
    "then the simplest strategies are the unconditional @xmath0-player , @xmath85 with @xmath86 , and the unconditional @xmath1-player , @xmath87 with @xmath88 + technically , to be complete , both strategies need a fifth , unconditional probability of playing @xmath0 in the first move ( when no history is known to condition the move on )",
    ". however , since the game is infinitely long , the first move is of neglectable relevance for press and dyson s analysis @xcite .",
    "this will especially hold true in the following analysis using markov chain theory . * payoff vectors for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in order of @xmath89 . in the example of symmetric games , @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( see [ tab : symmetricgame ] ) . * a common discount factor for both players . to facilitate analysis , and in line with press and dyson s ( implicit ) practice ,",
    "we assume @xmath92 for now .",
    "this allows us to assume that both players seek to maximize their ( expected ) average payoff over all iterations , which is easily comparable to simple stage game payoffs , since an infinite series of stage games yielding payoffs @xmath66 will have an average payoff of exactly @xmath66 . maximizing average",
    "payoff is equivalent to maximizing total payoff ( which is given by [ eq : discountedpayoff ] for @xmath92 ) @xcite .",
    "+ since the average payoffs are directly comparable to stage game payoffs , we will later define @xmath93 to denote player @xmath16 s expected average payoffs , continuing the same notation from [ chap : intro ] : from here on , only infinitely iterated games will be analyzed , and @xmath93 is simply taken to mean `` expected average score over all , i.e. infinitely many games to come .

    "this yields the iterated game s markov transition matrix : @xmath98 the transition matrix gives the probability of being in a specific state at any point of the markov chain : let @xmath99 be a column vector giving the probability distribution over the four states in the first iteration ( which would be given by unconditional probabilities for @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the first stage game ) , i.e. @xmath100 and e.g. @xmath101 .",

    "however , by calculating @xmath109 it can be shown that the chain converges nonetheless ( cf .",
    "[ app : matrixmult ] ) .",
    "this suffices to prove that the average time spent in any of the four possible states will converge , and a unique stationary distribution will exist @xcite . ]",
    "that for general @xmath106 and @xmath107 and for any starting distribution @xmath99 , the markov process given by @xmath108 will converge to the same probability distribution ( the stationary distribution ) for later iterations .",

    "* thm 4.1.6 ) ( @xmath112 @xmath113 is a left eigenvector of @xmath108 with eigenvalue 1 ) : this can be understood by recalling that the markov chain is a process that repeatedly visits a finite set of states ( in our case , @xmath114 ) .",
    "when such a process is infinitely long , it is intuitive that the average number of visits for each state will converge to a distribution over states that replicates itself .",
    "mathematical analysis shows this distribution to be unique .",
    "since our game is infinitely iterated , @xmath115 will give the expected distribution @xcite over game outcomes : we know that in some future iteration , the distribution over @xmath114 will reach @xmath115 , and that from then on it will stay there forever , making it the expected distribution for the total infinite chain .",
    "the law of large numbers for markov chains proves that as the game proceeds over an infinite number of stages , the average of observed game outcomes will also converge to @xmath115 @xcite .    since the average payoffs for @xmath2 and @xmath3 depend only on this history of game outcomes , the expected average payoff for both players will also converge in an infinitely iterated game .",

    "it is noted that using expected payoffs generally implies that players are risk - neutral , an assumption made in order not to further complicate our analysis : a partial remedy may be to modify stage game payoffs to reflect risk aversion . ] it is therefore convenient to define @xmath122 from here on ( which is directly comparable to stage game payoffs , as noted above ) .",

    "if @xmath3 has time preferences , however , the results from [ sec : zdconvergence ] imply that by choosing an appropriate strategy @xmath210 , @xmath3 is able to slow convergence down .",

    "regardless of how large @xmath214 is , @xmath3 will be better off making his extortioner rich than keeping both players poor .",
    "if @xmath3 has time preferences , two cases are possible : if @xmath61 is large enough , the dynamic leading @xmath3 to fully committing to his extortioner ( e.g. by playing @xmath85 ) will work when @xmath3 maximizes @xmath215 as well . when @xmath61 is too small , the promise of gaining @xmath216 over many future iterations will not suffice , and @xmath3 should revert to more short - term strategies .",
    "that is , @xmath202 puts another constraint on the maximum extortion factor , if @xmath2 intends to successfully extort @xmath3 .",
    "of course , the above remark on the possibility ( and desirability ) of convergence retarding strategies applies to _ zdextortion _ strategies as well .    naturally , giving in to @xmath2 s",
    "mischief or extortion will disappoint some players , even if it presents the best response by private interest .",
    "suppose , for example , @xmath3 exhibits a sense of justice ( or social preferences ) and refuses to contribute to @xmath2 s `` unfair '' extortion : by defecting ( or playing a zd strategy himself ) , he can enforce the `` fair '' but mediocre payoffs @xmath153 .",
    "thus , zd strategies in 2x2 games resemble an iterated ultimatum game , where ( any ) one player might be tempted to enforce an unequal distribution of payoffs , and the other is left with the decision to either comply or sacrifice own payoff .",
    "similarly to the ultimatum game , the standard best response is to accept any `` immoral '' offer that is at least slightly better than the maximin payoff , despite a multitude of empirical observations confirming experiment subjects to tend to more equal splits ( cf .",
    "see also @xcite for a description of circumstances that may drive @xmath2 towards a more equal split by herself ) .",
    "an important difference to the original ultimatum game is that in playing against a _ zdextortion _ strategy with @xmath217 there exist so far unstudied responses which present a stronger retaliation than merely falling back to maximin payoffs : if any stage game strategy combination exists yielding lower payoffs than maximin for both players , @xmath3 can choose a strategy such that @xmath218 .",
    "in this case , the extortionist s constraint on expected scores , @xmath142 , backfires , as he will then receive _ less _ than @xmath3 .",

    "such retaliation depends on the possibility of achieving @xmath218 . for igc as defined here , an example of retaliation is shown in [ fig : igc_extvsalld ] , where the _ zdextortion _ strategy provided above plays against @xmath87 ( the strategy always playing @xmath1 ) , and the zd constraint is satisfied by @xmath219 . however , a savvy extortionist can anticipate this reaction and avoid choosing @xmath147 , settling for @xmath220 and an upper constraint on his extortion .",
    "retaliation is feasible whenever @xmath221 yields a valid probability vector @xmath107 . knowing that @xmath141 is bounded below in @xmath65 for symmetric games , the feasibility of retaliation then depends on @xmath222 being relatively small : if and only if @xmath223 , there exist payoff combinations lower than @xmath65 , viz",

    "such retaliation is not possible , since @xmath228 is implied by definition .",
    "interestingly , in a simulated tournament of several well - known strategies in the conventionally - valued ipd , stewart and plotkin report a strategy obtained by setting @xmath229 to be particularly successful in terms of average score @xcite .",
    "this strategy effectively vows to suffer more from every deviation from mutual cooperation than its opponent : it can easily be exploited ( by choosing a strategy to earn any average payoff @xmath230 ) .",
    "it can only be assumed that the success of stewart and plotkin s strategy depends heavily on the zoo of strategies playing .",
    "the folk theorem guarantees the existence of nash equilibria for a convex set of average payoffs .",
    "therefore , it guarantees nash equilibria for cooperative payoff distributions as well as for payoffs which could be described as `` unfair , '' such as f in [ fig : zdvsfolk ] : provided @xmath61 is close enough to 1 , a grim trigger strategy exists to stabilize f as the average payoff of a nash equilibrium in the infinitely iterated game .",
    "assume @xmath2 plays this strategy , then @xmath3 is confronted with the choice to either comply and receive on average slightly more than @xmath65 , or to play his maximin strategy , receiving @xmath231 .",
    "by contrast , f can also be achieved when @xmath2 plays a zd strategy ( either mischievous and extortionate ) , provided @xmath3 plays the appropriate strategy in response . in this case",

    "note that @xmath3 is free to play a _",

    "now assume that @xmath3 is less witting : he either does not know @xmath2 s strategy ( i.e. he observes her actions , but does not know @xmath106 ) , or he is for some reason unable to immediately find a best response ( he can not solve the complex maximization problem , e.g. ) . then @xmath3 can be called a `` mindless local maximizer '' , i.e. he will try to maximize his expected private payoff in a `` trial - and - error''-like fashion by gradually changing parts of his strategy and observing the impacts on his payoff . press and dysonsuggest that in many games , a strictly positive gradient leads @xmath3 from this situation towards @xmath85 , ( a special zd strategy ) . ]",
    "i.e. @xmath235 for any @xmath107 @xcite . to maximize either @xmath236 or @xmath237 , whether locally or globally , implies that @xmath3 has full knowledge of @xmath106 , or remembers enough outcomes to make an adequate estimate of it . in particular ,",
    "not all adaptive strategies will be drawn to @xmath85 : consider the case of learner strategies , such as reinforcement learners or impulse learners @xcite . since",
    "such strategies adapt to their observations of how successful certain strategy choices were in the past , they fail to recognize infinitesimal advantages that only matter in the infinite time horizon ( the action @xmath238 in the @xmath53-th iteration changes the probability distribution over @xmath114 in _ all _ following iterations ) .",
    "learner strategies will thus generally fail to be lead to @xmath85 . ]",
    "if this is indeed the case , then instead of stating that f can be the outcome of a nash equilibrium , it can now be stated that f _ will _ be achieved if @xmath3 adapts his strategy to react to the environment enforced by @xmath2 s zd strategy .",
    "hence , by contrast to the equilibria guaranteed by the folk theorem , zd strategies do not present their opponent with an `` all - or - nothing''-choice .",
    "instead , they impose a linear constraint and allow their opponent to move freely along it , hoping to provide enough incentives to nudge him towards favorable behavior . by choosing a zd strategy ,",
    "players generally decide _ against _ a myopically better alternative to maintain the `` carrot - and - stick '' logic leading their opponent towards exploitable behavior .",
    "as such , zd strategies defeat the logic of nash equilibria and the folk theorem : they simply have different intentions .",
    "choosing to play zd strategies generally appears to be the choice of a very conscious player whose reasoning goes beyond the logic of nash equilibria : the formal argument that playing a zd strategy is mostly _ not _ a best reply would probably not concern a true extortioner who realizes that by changing his strategy he also changes the strategy of his best - response - playing opponent . in a way",
    ", zd strategies are thus exploiting economic rationality , at least the prevalent _ ceteris paribus _ kind : zd strategies , in classic economic terms `` irrational , '' exploit best responders .",
    "any zd strategy player @xmath2 who sticks to her strategy , discarding other `` best responses , '' will likely have a theory of mind @xcite .",
    "as such , her choice of playing a zd strategy will depend on whether she attributes her opponent , @xmath3 , the same meta - cognitive capabilities @xcite : if both players have a theory of mind , both might refuse to give in to their opponent s extortion , resulting in a long ultimatum game where both players constantly decline the unfair share offered , resulting in very low scores for both ( or , more optimistically put , both players will at some point arrive at a `` fair '' distribution ) .",
    "the success of any zd strategy thus depends on properties of its opponent that lie beyond the definition of the infinitely iterated game .",
    "until now , we merely discussed the existence of zd strategies , and their implications if @xmath2 were to play one .",
    "we were interested in how the discovery of zd strategies can `` change the game , '' simply supposing that @xmath2 be mischievous enough to choose a zd strategy .",
    "what we did not ask yet is , `` _ _ why _ _ would @xmath2 want to play a zd strategy ? ''    of course , as discussed in [ sec : bestresponse , sec : zdfolk ] , if @xmath2 possesses a superior theory of mind and knows @xmath3 to mindlessly maximize his score , _ zdextortion _ strategies allow her extraordinarily high payoffs .",
    "another possible area for applications of zd strategies is evolutionary game theory .",
    "the analyses of classic economics are usually _ ceteris paribus _ : everything else equal , actors prefer to have more private welfare rather than less . the individual s environment is thus taken as exogenous and fixed : often , however , `` the environment of an individual is itself composed of other individuals who are subject to the same forces of [ competition ] '' @xcite .",
    "suppose the iterated game @xmath2 is playing is a competition , e.g. for market dominance or for `` employee of the month '' status .",
    "then @xmath2 will realize that her success in the competition may depend on the peculiarities of her environment at the very time - instant of her move : market success of a firm depends not only on the quality of its products but also on what alternatives are competing for the same market .",
    "the possibility of standing out in the workplace depends just as much on how hard the coworkers are trying as on own effort . in economic competition , much like in evolutionary biology",
    ", the winner is not always the optimal candidate , but simply the one that outperforms the others .    to enable analysis for this paradigm ,",
    "the field of evolutionary game theory was developed , both by economists and evolutionary biologists @xcite .",
    "one implication of modeling competitive situations in selective environments ( such as markets or evolution ) is that the assumption of well - informed , `` global maximizer '' agents is dropped : competitors do not know what the optimal response to their environment is ( because it constantly changes , for example ) , and are thus forced to try out different alternatives : the selective forces of evolution then weed out unlucky tries .",
    ": @xcite gives a first analysis of zd strategies in this context . ]",
    "replicator dynamics are a standard tool of evolutionary game theory encapsulating these ideas : they state that at any point in time the growth rate of a population share using a certain strategy equals the difference between that strategy s payoff and the complete population s average payoff @xcite .",
    "the goal for an optimal strategy is thus shifted from finding a global maximum in private welfare to trying to earn more than others to ensure its ( genetic , market ) survival and dominance .",
    "when the global maximum is not known , one can not be certain that one can not be outperformed by an opponent .",
    "then it becomes rational to try to make sure that one s opponents earn less than oneself , even if this is only possible at a personal cost .    in this environment , _ zdextortion",
    "_ strategies with @xmath152 are of particular interest : suppose the total population of strategies consists of an incumbent strategy representing a large share of the population and an invader strategy which is only a small part of the population ( such an invader may be the result of biological mutation , business innovation or migration in spatial models ) .",
    "then by making sure that the invader receives smaller payoffs , the incumbent may protect itself against the invader .",
    "conversely , by enforcing higher payoffs for itself , the invader may win an upper hand over an incumbent .",
    "the available literature shows that the evolutionary success of _ zdextortion _ strategies is rather limited @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that _ zdextortion _ strategies with @xmath152 do not fare well against each other : for illustration , imagine an evolutionary tournament of ipd : players are allotted a fixed strategy and reproduce depending on their payoffs .",
    "suppose an incumbent population playing any strategy inc is invaded by a small group of _ zdextortion _ players .",
    "assume the zd players to have chosen @xmath239 : then in playing against each other , they will receive @xmath240 , where i define @xmath241 as an auxiliary function giving the payoff of strategy @xmath242 when playing against strategy @xmath243 . by partially giving in to extortion , the incumbent can achieve @xmath244 .",
    "therefore , the extortioner will do worse against itself than the incumbent to be extorted : it is clear that under these circumstances no _ zdextortion _ strategy can ever drive an incumbent to extinction @xcite . in particular ,",
    "if the incumbent is a @xmath71 strategy , it will achieve cooperative payoffs against itself while @xmath245 .",
    "thus , a zd strategy can not outperform tft in evolutionary contests . against some strategies ,",
    "however , zd strategies will be able to successfully invade a population and maintain a stable share @xmath246 there .. then the invading extortioners will successfully outperform the `` naive '' incumbent , growing in population share . as this happens , however , the frequency of zd strategies playing each other will increase , lowering their average score . at some point , the extortionate population will receive the same average score as the `` naive '' population , yielding a stable population share . to be concise ,",
    "let @xmath247 be the share of zd players ( then @xmath248 is the share of @xmath85 players ) .",
    "then by solving the equations for average score we obtain @xmath249 @xmath250 note that this does not take into account mutation dynamics , which further contribute to making zd strategies unstable .",
    "] to improve the evolutionary performance of zd strategies , kin selection mechanisms have been discussed : if the population of _ zdextortion _ strategies could identify those players playing the same strategy ( i.e. realize that their opponent also has a theory of mind ) , they could play more cooperative strategies against each other . for a more detailed account of the evolutionary performance of zd strategies ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "some of the popular reception of zd strategies has been hyperbolic : one ( likely influential ) example of this is @xcite : `` press and dyson have shown that cleverness and unfairness triumph after all [ ... ] [ they]re showing how to fake out evolution ! '' as discussed in this paper , the performance of zd strategies is highly dependent on a number of conditions , and zd strategies will not generally be successful in unpredictable tournaments ; in particular , in evolutionary settings as defined in evolutionary game theory , zd strategies are not overly successful . by noting that tft - like strategies generally perform better than other zd strategies in contexts where",
    "strategies are forced to play against themselves as well as others , it is safe to say that extortionate zd strategies do _ not _ end the reign of `` cooperative '' strategies like tft .    in `` evolutionary '' settings as defined by press and dyson(zd versus mindless maximizers ) , strategies that rationally adapt to their environment",
    "can successfully be exploited , however : this may be interpreted as a good reason against pure _ ceteris paribus _ maximization .",
    "the study of zd strategies enables exciting new perspectives in the study of iterated 2x2 games . while their existence is not entirely surprising ( as suggested by [ sec : zdfolk ] ) , and their performance highly dependent on factors both inside ( payoff matrix ) and outside the iterated game ( theory of mind ) , zd strategies highlight important mechanisms in iterated games : the role of memory ; classical equilibrium selection and maximizing paths along payoff gradients ; the importance of `` uncorrelated asymmetries , '' viz . the question who sets his strategy first and who reacts to it ; constraints on both players payoffs , both trivial ( such as @xmath87 ) and nontrivial ; and many more .",
    "not least of these , the exploitability of `` mindless economic maximizers '' by a player with a mind is an interesting philosophical datum to ponder about  as is the reassuring result that in evolutionary contexts mischief and extortion are limited by their own `` evil . ''",
