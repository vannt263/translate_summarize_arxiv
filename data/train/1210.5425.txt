    "the measurement of inclusive hadron yields in central au+au collisions at rhic led to the discovery of the suppression of hadron production at large transverse momenta ( @xmath3 ) compared to @xmath2 collisions  @xcite .",
    "this is generally attributed to the energy loss of light partons in the dense nuclear matter created at rhic .",
    "heavy quarks , i.e. charm and beauty , are believed to be mostly created in initial hard scattering processes of partons  @xcite and thus are excellent probes of the hot and dense matter formed in nucleus@xmath4nucleus collisions at high energy . while some of the produced pairs form bound quarkonia , the vast majority hadronize into hadrons carrying open heavy flavor .",
    "they interact with the medium and are expected to be sensitive to its energy density through the mechanism of parton energy loss . due to the large mass of heavy quarks",
    "the suppression of small angle gluon radiation should reduce their energy loss , and consequently any suppression of heavy - quark mesons like @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons at high @xmath3 is expected to be smaller than that observed for hadrons consisting of light quarks  @xcite .",
    "heavy quark production has been studied by the phenix experiment at rhic via measurements of single leptons from semi - leptonic decays in both the electron channel at mid - rapidity and in the muon channel at forward rapidity . in this paper",
    "i will summarize the latest phenix results concerning open and closed heavy flavor production as a function of beam energy and systems size , and will give an overview of the latest progress with the silicon vertex tracker ( vtx ) .",
    "the phenix detector  @xcite comprises three separate spectrometers in three pseudorapidity ( @xmath7 ) ranges .",
    "two central arms at midrapidity cover @xmath8 0.35 and have an azimuthal coverage ( @xmath9 ) of @xmath10/2 rad each , while muon arms at backward and forward rapidity cover -2.2 @xmath11 -1.2 and 1.2 @xmath11 2.4 , respectively , with full azimuthal coverage . in the central arms ,",

    "muons are identified by matching tracks measured in cathode - strip chambers , referred to as the muon tracker ( mutr ) , to hits in alternating planes of iarocci tubes and steel absorbers , referred to as the muon identifier ( muid ) .",

    "the integrated charm production cross - section at mid- and forward - rapidity are shown in fig  [ fig2 ] .    in heavy ion collisions ,",
    "the rhic experiments have revealed a suppression of the high transverse momentum component of hadron spectra at mid - rapidity in central au+au collisions compared to scaled momentum spectra from @xmath2 collisions at the same energy , @xmath22 =  200gev as shown in fig .",
    "this effect , originally proposed by bjorken , gyulassy , and others @xcite rests on the expectation of a large energy loss of high momentum partons scattered in the initial stages of collisions in a medium with a high density of free color charges . according to qcd theory",
    ", colored objects may lose energy by the bremsstrahlung radiation of gluons @xcite .",
    "such a mechanism would strongly degrade the energy of leading partons , reflected in the reduced transverse momentum of leading particles in the jets emerging after fragmentation into hadrons . adding to this discovery of suppression of particles at high transverse momentum , two very striking results have been seen for open heavy flavor from the phenix experiment via the measurement of electrons from semi - leptonic decays of hadrons carrying charm or bottom quarks .",
    "first , heavy mesons , despite their large mass , exhibit a suppression at high transverse momentum compared to that expected from @xmath2 interactions .",
    "this suppression is found to be similar to that of light mesons , which implies a substantial energy loss of fast heavy quarks while traversing the medium , see fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ; this shows the nuclear modification factors measured for different types of particle in au+au collisions at 200 gev .",
    "the nuclear modification factor is defined as : @xmath23 @xmath24 it involves scaling measured distributions of nucleon - nucleon transverse momentum by the number of expected incoherent binary collisions , @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "secondly , an elliptic flow is observed for heavy mesons which is comparable to that of light mesons like pions , see fig .",
    "this implies that the heavy quarks are in fact sensitive to the pressure gradients driving hydrodynamic flow giving new insights into the strongly coupled nature of the qgp fluid at these temperatures .",

    "the @xmath3 dependence of the nuclear modification is shown in fig  [ fig4 ] for central and peripheral collisions .",
    "enhancement is observed for the 0 - 20% most central collisions in the @xmath3 range 15gev/@xmath20 , while little or no enhancement is observed for peripheral collisions . at high @xmath3 , where strong suppression is observed for hf electrons in au+au collisions , the measured @xmath27 is consistent with unity .",
    "thus , the suppression observed in au+au collisions can be attributed , within the uncertainties on @xmath27 , to hot nuclear matter effects .",

    "we observe that @xmath28 ( cu+cu ) at forward rapidity is suppressed compared to @xmath28 ( cu+cu ) at mid - rapidity , suggesting the possibility that cold nuclear matter effects are larger at forward rapidity .",
    "the observed suppression is consistent with a calculation  @xcite that includes the effects of heavy - quark energy loss and in - medium heavy - meson dissociation , as well as cold nuclear matter effects due to shadowing and initial state energy loss due to multiple scattering of incoming partons before they interact to form the @xmath31 pair .",

    "for these early results , phenix was not able to distinguish electrons coming from the semi - leptonic decay of @xmath5  and  @xmath6 mesons independently . in order to understand these medium effects in more detail",
    "it is imperative to _ directly _ measure the nuclear modification and the flow of @xmath5  and  @xmath6 mesons separately .",
    "based on this motivation and impelled by the exciting physics we had already uncovered , in december 2010 , the phenix collaboration opened new era for measuring heavy flavor at rhic by installing new detector called the silicon vertex tracker ( vtx )  @xcite .",
    "the vtx was commissioned with @xmath2 at 500gev , and took data of @xmath2 and au+au during run-11 and , @xmath2 , cu+au and u+u during run-12 at rhic .",
    "the vtx detector consists of four layers of barrel detectors located in the region of pseudorapidity @xmath8  1.2 and covers almost the full azimuth .",

    "figure  [ fig9 ] shows the ladders of half barrels of pixel and stripixel , as well one complete half of the assembled vtx detector .",
    "the key element needed in directly identifying @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons in phenix is the ability to measure the collision vertex position with high accuracy and to compare that with the trajectory for each track . @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons decay into light mesons or leptons before reaching the detectors , thus the daughter particles",
    "are observed .",
    "as these do not originate at the collision vertex position , a large distance ( the decay - length of @xmath39 and @xmath40 are 123 and 457  @xmath41 m , respectively ) occurs between the vertex position and the daughter particle trajectory .",
    "based on the vtx detector measurements of the primary vertex , the beam size , and individual tracks for each collision like in au+au or in @xmath2 collisions , the reconstructed distance of closest approach ( dca ) distribution from primary vertex has been determined . in the present results from @xmath2 collisions at 200gev , the dca distribution was obtained using beam center ( instead primary vertex ) to avoid auto - correlation ( in @xmath2 there are only few tracks ) .",
    "dca distributions in @xmath2 and au+au collisions at 200gev obtained from rhic run-11 and run-12 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig11 ] shows that the dca resolution of individual tracks to the primary vertex , @xmath42(dca ) , is about 70 @xmath41 m .",
    "the achieved dca resolution is sufficient to distinguish @xmath5- and @xmath6-mesons from the difference of their decay - length .",
    "these measurements using phenix vtx detector clearly illustrate that this detector is working as expected and future heavy flavor physics program in phenix is very promising .",
