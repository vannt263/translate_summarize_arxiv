    "large parameter problems occur in all branches of pure and applied mathematics , in physics and engineering , in statistics and probability theory . on many occasions",
    "the problems are presented in the form of integrals or differential equations , or both , but we also encounter finite sums , infinite series , difference equations , and implicit algebraic equations .",
    "asymptotic methods for handling these problems have a long history with many prominent contributors . in 1863 , riemann used the method of steepest descent for hypergeometric functions , and in 1909 debye @xcite used this method to obtain approximations for bessel functions .",
    "in other unpublished notes , riemann also gave the first steps for approximating the zeta function and in 1932 siegel used this method to derive the riemann - siegel formula for the riemann zeta function .",
    "the method of stationary phase was essential in kelvin s work to describe the wave pattern behind a moving ship .    in the period 19401950 ,",
    "a systematic study of asymptotic methods started in the netherlands , driven by j.  g.   van der corput , who considered these methods important when studying problems of number theory in his earlier years in groningen .",
    "van der corput was one of the founders of the mathematisch centrum in amsterdam , and in 1946 he became the first director .",
    "he organized working groups and colloquia on asymptotic methods and he had much influence on workers in this area . during 19501960",
    "he wrote many papers on asymptotic methods and during his years in the usa he published lecture notes and technical reports .    nowadays his work on asymptotic analysis for integrals is still of interest , in particular his work on the method of stationary phase .",
    "he introduced for this topic the so - called neutralizer in order to handle integrals with several points that contribute to the asymptotic behavior of the complete integral .",
    "in later sections we give more details .    although van der corput wanted to publish a general compendium to asymptotic methods , the mc lecture notes and his many published papers , notes and reports were never combined into the standard work he would have liked .",
    "actually , there were no books on asymptotic methods before 1956 .",
    "in certain books and published papers these methods were considered in great detail .",
    "for example , in watson s book on bessel functions @xcite ( first edition in 1922 ) and in szeg s book on orthogonal polynomials @xcite ( first edition 1939 ) many results on asymptotic expansions can be found .",
    "erdlyi s book _ asymptotic expansions _",
    "@xcite came in 1956 , and the first edition of de bruijn s book _ asymptotic methods in analysis _",
    "@xcite was published in 1958 .",
    "this remarkable book was based on a course of lectures at the mc in 1954/1955 and at the technical university in eindhoven in 1956/1957 .",
    "de bruijn s book was well received .",
    "it was so interesting because of the many special examples and topics , and because the book was sparklingly written .",
    "the sometimes entertaining style made erdlyi remark in his comments in the mathematical reviews that the book was somewhat conversational . in addition , he missed the work of van der corput on the method of stationary phase .",
    "these minor criticisms notwithstanding , erdlyi was , in his review , very positive about this book .",
    "de bruijn motivated his selection of topics and way of treating them by observing that asymptotic methods are very flexible , and in such cases it is not possible to formulate a single theorem that covers all applications .",
    "it seems that he liked the saddle point method very much .",
    "he spent three chapters on explaining the method and provided difficult examples .",
    "for example , he considered the sum @xmath0 for large values of @xmath1 with @xmath2 a real number . furthermore , he discussed the generalization of euler s gamma function in the form @xmath3 with @xmath4 .    for many readers de bruijn s treatment of the saddle point method serves as the best introduction to this topic and",
    "many publications refer to this part of the book .",
    "other topics are iterative methods , implicit functions , and differential equations , all with apparently simple examples , but also with sometimes complicated forms of asymptotic analysis .    in this paper",
    "we give a short description of the classical methods that were available for one - dimensional integrals when de bruijn s book appeared in 1958 : integrating by parts , the method of stationary phase , the saddle point method , and the related method of steepest descent . shortly after this period",
    ", more powerful methods were developed in which extra parameters ( and not only the large parameter ) were taken into account .",
    "in these so - called uniform methods the asymptotic approximations usually contain certain special functions , such as error functions , airy functions , bessel functions , and parabolic cylinder functions .",
    "some simple results were already available in the literature .",
    "for example , watson @xcite mentions results from 1910 of nicholson in which airy functions have been used .    in a later section",
    "we give an overview of integrals with large and additional parameters for which we need uniform expansions .",
    "for a few cases we show details of uniform expansions of some well - known special functions , for which these uniform expansions are important      for information on the special functions we use in this paper , we refer to @xcite , the _ nist handbook of mathematical functions_.    we use pochhammer s symbol @xmath5 , or shifted factorial , defined by @xmath6 and @xmath7    in asymptotic estimates we use the big @xmath8-symbol , denoted by @xmath9 , and the little @xmath10-symbol .    for estimating a function @xmath11 with respect to @xmath12 , both functions defined in domain @xmath13 , we assume that @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a limit point of @xmath16 . possibly @xmath17 as @xmath18 .",
    "we use the @xmath9-symbol in the form @xmath19 which means that there is a constant @xmath20 such that @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .",
    "usually , for our asymptotic problems , @xmath15 is the point of infinity , @xmath16 is an unbounded part of a sector , for example @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the phase of the complex number @xmath25 , @xmath26 is a nonnegative number , and the real numbers @xmath27 satisfy @xmath28 . when we write @xmath29 , we mean that @xmath30 is bounded for all @xmath22 .",
    "the little @xmath10-symbol will also be used : @xmath31 which means that @xmath32 where the limiting point @xmath15 is approached inside @xmath16 .",
    "when we write @xmath33 , we mean that @xmath34 tends to zero when @xmath18 , @xmath22 .",
    "we write @xmath35 when @xmath36 , where the limiting point @xmath15 is approached inside @xmath16 . in that case",
    "we say that the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 are asymptotically equal at @xmath15 .",
    "assume that , for @xmath37 , a function @xmath38 has the representation @xmath39 with @xmath40 , such that for each @xmath41 the following relation holds @xmath42 in some unbounded domain @xmath16",
    ". then @xmath43 is called an asymptotic expansion of the function @xmath44 , and we denote this by @xmath45 poincar introduced this form in 1886 , and analogous forms can be given for @xmath46 , and so on .",
    "observe that we do not assume that the infinite series in converges for certain @xmath47values .",
    "this is not relevant in asymptotics ; in the relation in only a property of @xmath48 is requested , with @xmath1 fixed .",

    "see remark  [ rem : watlem ] .",
    "we give a short overview of the classical methods . in each method",
    "the contributions to the asymptotic behavior of the integral can be obtained from one or a few _ decisive points _ of the interval of integration .      in this section",
    "we consider the large @xmath25 asymptotic expansions of laplace - type integrals of the form @xmath57 for simplicity we assume that @xmath11 is analytic in a disc @xmath58 , @xmath59 and inside a sector @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",

    "we can prove the asymptotic property needed for the poincar - type expansion .",
    "for the proof ( also for more general conditions on @xmath11 ) we refer to @xcite .",

    "the condition for convergence in is @xmath74 , that is , @xmath75 . combining this with the bounds for @xmath70 we obtain the bounds for @xmath76 in .",
    "several modifications of watson s lemma are considered in the literature , for example of laplace transforms with logarithmic singularities at the origin .",
    "[ rem : watlem ] in example  [ ex : exponint ] for the exponential integral we have @xmath77 . in that case",
    "@xmath11 is analytic in the sector @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",

    "large values of @xmath87 destroy the asymptotic nature and the expansion in is valid for large @xmath25 in the shown sector , uniformly with respect to bounded values of @xmath87 .",
    "the expansion terminates when @xmath88 , and we have a finite exact representation . by using the many relations between the bessel functions , expansions for large argument of all other bessel functions",
