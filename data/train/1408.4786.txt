    "studies of the properties of stellar populations hinge on the accurate knowledge of the amount and properties of interstellar extinction , since they affect fundamental observational quantities such as the distance and luminosity function ( e.g. gottlieb & upson 1969 ) . the diffuse galactic interstellar medium ( ism )",
    "appears to have a rather uniform extinction law and the ratio of total and selective extinction @xmath7 is found to be consistently about @xmath8 ( e.g. savage & mathis 1979 ) .",
    "however , in star forming regions the situation is rather different : @xmath9 varies considerably in our galaxy and studies conducted over the past 40 years have revealed a wide variety of extinction curves ( e.g. bless & savage 1972 ; seaton 1979 ; fitzpatrick 1998 , 1999 ) . in particular , in dense star forming regions the situation is quite different from that of the diffuse ism and generally the value of @xmath9 appears to increase ( e.g. johnson & mendoza 1964 ; savage & mathis 1979 ; cardelli , clayton & mathis 1988 ) , due to the presence of larger grains , with a correspondingly rather different shape of the extinction curve .    nonetheless , there appears to be some commonality in the properties of the extinction in these environments . even though the extinction curves are effectively different , cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 )",
    "have shown that the properties of the extinction at optical and near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths appear to be correlated with those in the ultraviolet , and the measured @xmath10 can generally be described by one family of curves depending only on @xmath9 . for instance , valencic , clayton & gordon ( 2004 ) compiled a homogeneous database of 417 extinction curves towards galactic stars , finding that 93% of them are compatible with the @xmath9-dependent extinction parameterization of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , within the uncertainties .",
    "fitzpatrick & massa ( 2007 ) offer a different interpretation of the results by valencic et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , pointing out that the dependence of @xmath10 on @xmath9 only is partially caused by the fact that @xmath10 is derived from the measured colour excess by taking the value of @xmath9 into account , therefore necessarily causing some degree of apparent correlation . according to fitzpatrick & massa ( 2007 ) , extinction curves are not a one - parameter family in @xmath9 and a variety of curves remains even in our galaxy .    in this work",
    "we do not address the matter of the functional form of the extinction laws , but rather concentrate on the physical properties of the extinction inside the tarantula nebula ( 30dor ) .",
    "a robust determination of the extinction curve in this environment    is crucial for modern astronomy , since this object is the closest and only known starburst in the local group . the strength of star formation in 30dor and the number of massive stars that it harbours are similar to those found in interacting galaxies in the local universe and in young galaxies at high redshift ( @xmath11 , e.g. meurer et al .",
    "1997 ; shapley et al .",
    "2003 ; heckman et al .",
    "2004 ) . furthermore , with a metallicity of the order of 1/3 @xmath12 ( e.g. hill , andrievsky & spite 1995 ; geha et al .",
    "1998 ) , 30dor allows us to probe the prevailing conditions at redshift @xmath13 , when star formation was at its peak in the universe ( e.g. madau et al .",
    "1996 ; lilly et al 1996 ) . thus",
    ", determining the properties of the extinction in 30dor will not only allow us to understand how star formation is proceeding in this specific large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) environment , but also in a cosmological sense .",
    "gordon et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have carried out an exhaustive study of the extinction properties in the lmc towards 19 different lines of sight , extending previous investigations by clayton & martin ( 1985 ) and misselt , clayton & gordon al .",
    "they find that only four of the 19 sight lines probed appear to be compatible with the @xmath9-dependent family of extinction curves of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , thereby revealing a wider variety than in the milky way .",
    "unfortunately , none of the sight lines probe specifically the 30dor region : although 8 of them are associated with the lmc2 supershell near the tarantula nebula , the nearest star is @xmath14 away from the centre of 30dor and the others are beyond @xmath15 , with a median distance of @xmath16 , typically probing a projected distance of @xmath17pc or three times the radius of the nebula ( lebouteiller et al .",
    "2008 ) .    until recently , the most accurate empirical determination of the extinction law inside 30dor was the 30-year old study by fitzpatrick & savage ( 1984 ) .",
    "these authors used the traditional approach of the `` pair method , '' in which the flux distribution or colours of a reddened object are compared with those of a reference star of the same spectral type ( _ e.g. , _ johnson 1968 ; massa , savage & fitzpatrick 1983 ; cardelli , sembach & mathis 1992 ) .",
    "this method is very reliable and can detect subtle variations of the extinction law with the environment , but it works optimally if using targets such as massive stars with high quality spectra extending from the near ultraviolet to the nir .    given the level of crowding present inside 30dor , the extinction law derived by fitzpatrick & savage ( 1984 ) is based on just a handful of lines of sight ( namely 7 within the central @xmath18 of r136a ) .",
    "this situation has been recently improved by maz apellniz et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , who used a bayesian approach to derive the so - called `` extinction without standards '' ( fitzpatrick & massa 2005 ) at optical and some nir wavelengths towards 83 ob stars in the inner @xmath19 radius of r136 .",
    "this work indicates that the extinction is variable in the field and @xmath9 is typically in the range @xmath20 . on the other hand",
    ", these early - type massive stars do not necessarily sample the same environment in which low - mass stars form ( e.g. de marchi , panagia & sabbi 2011 ) , and due to their short life they can not reveal the long - term evolution of the dust grains in those regions . in other words ,",
    "massive stars only allow us to probe the most active star - forming environments at the peak of the burst , but those conditions are not characteristic of all objects in the field .",
    "to overcome these limitations , we have developed a new method to unambiguously determine the absolute value of the extinction in a uniform way across a field such as that of 30dor ( de marchi , panagia & girardi 2014 ; hereafter paperi ) .",
    "our method makes use of multi - band photometry of red giant stars belonging to the red clump ( rc ) .",
    "other authors have used rc observations in the past to study the reddening distribution and to derive reddening maps in the lmc ( e.g. zaritsky 1999 ; haschke et al .",
    "2011 ; tatton et al .",
    "however , all these works have assumed an extinction law and therefore can not derive it independently .",
    "applied to a typical field in the magellanic clouds , such as 30dor , our method offers many advantages : _ ( i ) _ all rc stars on which we operate are at the same distance , to better than 1% ; _ ( ii ) _ they have very similar intrinsic physical properties in all bands , within @xmath21 mag for similar age and metallicity ; _ ( iii ) _ our statistics is very solid , with about 20 stars arcmin@xmath22 or @xmath23 objects in a typical _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) pointing ; and _ ( iv ) _ we derive a self - consistent absolute extinction curve over the entire wavelength range covered by the photometry with no need for spectroscopic observations .",
    "this method can be easily extended to other nearby galaxies .    in this work ,",
    "we apply our method to the panchromatic observations of 30dor in the range @xmath24 m collected in 2009 with the wfc3 instrument on board the hst ( de marchi et al .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "the observations are presented in section 2 , while the selection of rc stars is discussed in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to deriving the absolute extinction towards rc stars and the corresponding extinction law . in section 5",
    "we discuss the reddening distribution in this field . a summary and our conclusions follow in section 6 .",
    "the observations used in this work were obtained in 2009 october using the wfc3 camera on board the hst , and are extensively described in de marchi et al .",
    "( 2011a ) .",
    "the filters used , the number of exposures and their total durations are listed in table[tab1 ] .",
    "the observations made use of an extensive dithering pattern , combining long and short exposures , in order to improve the sampling of the telescope s point spread function and increase the dynamic range of the photometry .",
    "figure[fig1 ] shows a region of about @xmath25 at the centre of the field covered by the observations ( the total area covered spans @xmath26 ) .",
    "the bright cluster in the field is r136 .",
    "the panel on the left provides a colour - composite , with the blue channel obtained by averaging the f336w and f439w filters , the f555w filter serves as green channel , the f814w filter as red channel and the f656n filter is used as orange .",

    "( 2014 ) obtain an apparently wide spread of @xmath9 values , namely @xmath27 , although the 50 stars with the smallest uncertainty on @xmath9 ( @xmath28 or less ) indicate a smaller spread , namely @xmath29 . the thin solid line in figure[fig4 ]",
    "corresponds to @xmath30 and provides a good fit to our optical data .    the very good agreement between the @xmath9 values measured by us and by maz apellniz et al .",
    "( 2014 ) is noteworthy , because they are derived from stars of different types , namely rgs in our case and ob stars in theirs . in principle , when the extinction is obtained from @xmath31 and @xmath32 photometry alone , the colour excess @xmath33 corresponding to a given value of @xmath34 , and hence the derived value of @xmath9 , will depend on the intrinsic colour of the stars used for the measurements .",
    "mccall ( 2004 ) has extensively discussed and quantified this effect , showing that the @xmath9 value obtained from giants with @xmath35 like our rc stars could be about @xmath36 larger than that estimated from hot stars with @xmath37 .",
    "this happens because the effective wavelengths of both bands become redder , but more in @xmath31 than in @xmath32 and hence the extinction in @xmath31 is reduced more than in @xmath32 . in this way",
    "@xmath33 is lowered with respect to @xmath34 and @xmath9 appears higher .",
    "however , the importance of these effects is much lower if the @xmath38 colour is used instead .",
    "as discussed in section4 , our extinction law @xmath39 is primarily based on those bands , owing to the smaller photometric uncertainties in @xmath40 ( see also table[tab3 ] ) .",
    "indeed , the excellent agreement between our @xmath9 value and that obtained from spectrophotometry by maz apellniz et al .",
    "( 2014 ) confirms that there are no systematic differences in the optical domain .",
    "interestingly , longwards of @xmath41 a systematic deviation between our curve and that of maz apellniz et al.s ( 2014 )    is observed .",
    "a similar deviation is seen if we compare our extinction law with that of fitzpatrick & massa ( 1990 ) and cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , which is the functional form that maz apellniz et al .",
    "( 2014 ) have assumed in the nir .",
    "however , they warn the reader that in the nir range alternatives to the cardelli s law can not be excluded , given the small values of the nir extinction of the stars in the sample . for that reason , in figure[fig4 ] the curve of maz apellniz et al .",
    "( 2014 ) in shown with a dotted line in this spectral range .",
    "we believe that the considerable complexity of the extinction phenomenon ( many different materials , many different sizes , etc . ) makes it excessively hard and perhaps even futile to define a simple parametric curve to describe the observations accurately .",
    "therefore , instead of attempting a parametric fit to the extinction curve that we have measured , we concentrate on the implications of its shape for the physical properties of the grains .      with @xmath42 ,",
    "the extinction law that we measure around r136 is considerably flatter ( i.e. less steep in logarithmic terms ) than the extinction law of the galactic ism shown by the short dashed line .",
    "the same is true for the extinction law in the field @xmath43 sw , where @xmath44 ( paperi ) . in linear terms , the extinction law in these regions is actually almost exactly parallel to the galactic curve , as the thin dashed lines show .",
    "the latter are simply the portion of the galactic law shortwards of @xmath45 m shifted vertically by an offset of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , and provide a surprisingly good fit to our observations inside r136 and in the neighbouring field .",
    "note that also the optical portion of the extinction curve of gordon et al .",
    "( 2003 ) is parallel to our measurements , and if shifted vertically by an offset of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively , it provides a good fit to our observations .    the green solid line shown in figure[fig4 ] represents the difference between the extinction law in r136 and that in the galaxy , that we take as a template .",
    "the difference is indeed remarkably flat shortwards of @xmath50 m ( see also table[tab4 ] ) .",
    "this very fact indicates that the extinction law in 30dor is of a type similar to that of the mw ( and of the regions around the tarantula nebula ) , but that there is an additional component , whose contribution is `` grey '' in the optical , where it does not depend on wavelength .",
    "this means that there must be a larger fraction of large grains , compared to that of the diffuse galactic ism and the surroundings of 30dor .    at wavelengths longwards of @xmath45 m ,",
    "the extinction law in 30dor falls off as @xmath51 , virtually indistinguishable from the observed behaviour of the mw extinction law ( cardelli et al .",
    "1989 ) , thereby indicating that the nature of the grains is the same . indeed ,",
    "the dot - dashed line shown in figure[fig4 ] is simply the portion of the galactic extinction law longwards of @xmath45 m multiplied by a factor of @xmath52 .",
    "we see that it fits the observations in the @xmath53 and @xmath54 bands quite well .",
    "a detailed modeling of the extinction curve is beyond the scope of this work and will be deferred to a future paper",
    ". however , there are simple considerations that can provide valuable insights into the properties of the additional dust component that is present in the 30dor nebula .",
    "it is well known ( _ e.g. , _ van de hulst 1957 ; greenberg 1968 ; draine & lee 1984 ) that at wavelengths short enough the extinction cross section of a grain tends asymptotically to its geometric cross section @xmath55 , where @xmath56 denotes the grain radius . at longer wavelengths",
    "the extinction is essentially pure absorption and the cross section is smaller than @xmath57 , being proportional to @xmath58 .",
    "conveniently enough , the transition occurs approximately at @xmath59 .",
    "thus , for a fixed grain size , one would expect a sort of a step function behaviour with the transition occurring abruptly around @xmath60 .",
    "on the other hand , the galactic extinction law is seen to increase steadily with the wave number @xmath61 , over a wide range of wavelengths , say , from @xmath62 m or @xmath63m@xmath64 to @xmath65 m or @xmath66m@xmath64 .",
    "this is the reason why to account for the mw extinction law a grain size distribution as been invoked , with an approximate form of a power - law @xmath67 within the interval from @xmath68 m and @xmath69 m ( mathis , rumpl & nordsieck 1977 ; draine & lee 1984 ) .",
    "with such a law one can reproduce the observations quite well , essentially as a sum of step functions in which the large grain extinction dominates at the longer wavelengths and progressively smaller grains account for the increasing extinction at shorter wavelengths .",
    "it is worth noting that , for a size distribution @xmath70 with @xmath71 , at wavelengths longer than @xmath72 the extinction is dominated by the largest grains and is proportional to the total mass in grains . as shown in figure[fig4 ] , the 30dor nebula extinction law can be represented by the sum of a standard mw extinction curve plus one produced by an additional component of large grains ( solid brown curve ) .",
    "the fact that in the nir the total extinction towards r136 is about twice as high as in the mw implies that the total mass in large grains is about twice as high as in the mw .",
    "this conclusion should be regarded in relative terms , in the sense that the relative abundance of the large grains must be a factor of @xmath52 higher .",
    "large @xmath73 values are typical of dense , still relatively quiescent clouds , that have not yet undergone extensive star formation .",
    "an example is the orion nebula , where @xmath74 ( e.g. johnson 1967 ; lee 1968 ) . like in 30dor , the dust in orion is dense - cloud dust that is now being exposed to hot young stars and its extinction curve is dominated by large grains ( e.g. cardelli & clayton 1988 ) .",
    "a higher relative abundance of large grains may be obtained in at least three different ways : _",
    "i ) _ selective destruction of small grains so as to skew the size distribution in favour of large grains ; _ ii ) _ selective condensation of material on the surface of small grains , making them effectively bigger ; _ iii ) _ selective injection of `` fresh '' large grains into the mw mix .",
    "the first option may be discounted because it would imply an uv extinction law that is flatter than that in the mw , whereas in fact a steep rise in the uv has been measured towards stars of the magellanic clouds , as compared to mw objects ( _ e.g. _ fitzpatrick 1998 ) .",
    "the second option would create the same problem as the first one and , in addition , it would require an efficient condensation process to operate on the surfaces of the grains .",
    "the third scenario looks more likely , because adding new large grains could easily account for the presence of the new component of the extinction curve , without conflicting against any existing evidence at other wavelengths , most notably the uv .",
    "furthermore , injection of large grains is an exciting possibility opened by recent _",
    "herschel _ and _ alma _ observations of sn1987a ( matsuura et al .",
    "2011 ; indebetouw et al .",
    "these observations suggest that a substantial amount ( @xmath75 ) of large grains ( @xmath76 m ) were created in the ejecta of the supernova .",
    "that large grains are indeed formed in sne has been recently established for sn2010jl ( gall et al . 2014 ) .",
    "thus if one assumes that a comparable output follows _ all _ typeii supernova explosions , it would be easy to understand why regions of recent star formation may display the presence of a higher content of large grains . within this scenario",
    ", one would expect that in regions where star formation was active in the recent past , say , @xmath77myr ( i.e. the lifetime of 8 stars that represent the lower mass limit of supernova type ii progenitors ) , the excess of large grains should be highest .",
    "such an excess would be definitely higher than in the diffuse ism , and should be possibly higher than that in regions of ongoing star formation ( age @xmath78myr ) because the enrichment of large grains has not started yet or has not lasted long enough to produce noticeable effects .",
    "uv observations of early - type stars in this region reaching down to wavelengths of @xmath79 are needed to probe the distribution of small grains and understand whether the additional component that we have detected is only composed of large grains or whether smaller grains are also present and in which proportion .",
    "these observations are possible with the _ cosmic origin spectrograph _ on board the hst .",
    "since we have derived the extinction law characteristic of this region , we can measure the extinction towards any object in the field whose nominal location in the cmd is known .",
    "this is the case of the rc stars and of those in the upper ms ( ums ) .",
    "zaritsky ( 1999 ) used observations from the magellanic clouds photometric survey ( harris , zaritsky & thompson 1997 ) to study the reddening distribution towards hot ( @xmath80k ) and cold ( 5500k @xmath81 6500k ) stars , finding that the former appear on average more extinguished than the latter .",
    "however , in paperi we showed that this is not always the case : in the field that we studied , located about @xmath43 sw of 30dor , ums stars span a narrower range of @xmath33 values than rc objects .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached by sabbi et al .",
    "( 2013 ) in their preliminary study of the tarantula nebula . in the following we",
    "explore the distribution of the absorbing material in the core of 30dor , using the information contained in the optical colour  colour ( cc ) and colour  magnitude diagrams .",
    "we do not consider nir bands here because our nir photometry covers a substantially smaller field and because the lower nir extinction can be measured in fewer stars .",
    "the objects that we have used for this study are indicated as thick symbols in the @xmath82 _ vs. _ @xmath83 cmd of figure[fig6 ] .",
    "they include the 140 bona - fide rc stars ( shown in orange ) and an additional 202 ums stars ( blue ) selected along the extension of the reddening vector defined by the rc .",
    "the dashed lines in the figure are tangent to the spread ellipse around the nominal rc location ( also shown ) and parallel to the reddening vector . like in the case of the rc stars ,",
    "the ums objects were selected to have a combined photometric uncertainty in all optical bands of @xmath84mag or less ( i.e. , @xmath85 ) and @xmath86 .",
    "the objects marked in cyan in the figure are the 83 stars studied spectroscopically by maz  apellniz et al .",
    "( 2014 ) that we will later compare to our ums stars .",
    "all blue objects in our and maz  apellniz et al.s sample have measured colours @xmath87 .",
    "the spatial location of all these objects is shown in figure[fig7 ] .    in section[sec_ccd ]",
    "we will discuss the reddening distribution towards this sample of ums and rc stars using the cc diagram .",
    "furthermore , in section[sec_cmd ] we will add to this sample the objects marked as thick circles in figure[fig6 ] ( 45 stars in total ) .",
    "these rc stars are typically fainter than the rest ( most have @xmath88 ) , and their photometric uncertainty in the @xmath89 band is somewhat larger , typically @xmath90mag .",
    "therefore , these objects do not meet the condition @xmath85 that we have imposed to select the bona - fide rc stars discussed in section3 .",
    "however , their combined photometric uncertainty in the @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath91 bands still fully meets that condition , i.e. with @xmath92 these objects have excellent photometry in these bands .",
    "their inclusion in the sample will prove crucial to study more extinguished rc stars that are otherwise not easily detectable in our shallower @xmath89-band exposures .",
    "we begin by studying the reddening distribution in the cc diagram of figure[fig8 ] , obtained by combining all available optical bands . for now , we consider only stars with @xmath85 , namely the 140 bona - fide rc stars and the 202 ums objects shown in figure[fig6 ] , respectively , in blue and orange ( the colours of the symbols stay the same ) .",
    "the `` s''-shaped solid curve at the bottom of figure[fig8 ] ( marked @xmath93 ) corresponds to the theoretical colours from the models of bessell , castelli & plez ( 1998 ) for stars with gravity @xmath94 , metallicity @xmath95 and effective temperature in the range 4000k  40000k , for the specific wfc3 bands used here ( the values of the effective temperature are indicated along the curve ) .",
    "the curve already includes the foreground mw contribution to the reddening , i.e. @xmath96 .    the s - curve moves in the cc plane according to the attenuation caused by the extinction in each band . as we discussed in paperi , although @xmath39 is fixed by the extinction law at a specific wavelength , for a given @xmath33 the observed extinction value @xmath97 depends on the spectrum of the star , because it is integrated over the entire filter bandwidth .",
    "this effect is more pronounced for cold stars than for hot stars and for blue filters than for red filters ( see romaniello et al .",
    "2002 ; girardi et al .",
    "2008 ) . to produce the other s - curves of figure[fig8 ] , with @xmath98 ,",
    "we have applied to the models of bessell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) mentioned above an attenuation corresponding to incremental values of @xmath33 , assuming the extinction specific to this region as derived in the previous section .",
    "we have calculated the attenuation over the entire wavelength range covered by the models , for values of @xmath99 ranging from 0 to 1 in steps of @xmath100 mag . using _",
    "synphot _ ( laidler et al . 2005 ) , we have folded the attenuated models through the specific wfc3 bands and derived the corresponding magnitudes in the hst system .",
    "the various s - curves in figure[fig8 ] correspond to values of @xmath99 ranging from 0 to @xmath101 in steps of @xmath84 , as indicated .",
    "inspection of figure[fig8 ] reveals that ums stars span a narrower range of @xmath99 values than rc objects , and all of them have @xmath102 .",
    "this difference is also seen in figure[fig9 ] , showing separately the histograms of the distribution of rc stars ( orange solid line ) and ums stars ( blue long - dashed line ) , with the latter rescaled to the same number of stars as rc objects . a smaller spread of @xmath33 for ums stars is not surprising , because the ums stars are associated with r136 and have a limited spatial distribution along the line of sight .",
    "the @xmath99 values that we have derived for the ums stars can be compared with with those derived spectroscopically in the same field by maz  apellniz et al .",
    "these authors have analysed a total of 67 o - type stars and 16 b - type stars , for which spectra are available in the range @xmath103  at a spectral resolution @xmath104 from the `` vlt  flames tarantula survey '' ( evans et al .",
    "these stars are indicated as cyan dots in figures[fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] .",
    "having determined the spectral types for these objects allows maz  apellniz et al .",
    "( 2014 ) to derive an accurate value of the extinction towards each of them .",
    "the green short - dashed line in figure[fig9 ] shows the histogram of their @xmath33 distribution .",
    "for ease of comparison with our results , we have shifted the histogram of maz  apellniz et al .",
    "( 2014 ) by @xmath105mag to the left , to account for the foreground mw extinction , since that is not included in our @xmath99 values .",
    "the reddening distribution is very similar to the one we found .",
    "the only statistically significant difference is in the number of stars with @xmath106 and we attribute this to the different composition of the two samples , since ours is exclusively made up of late o - type stars in the range @xmath107 , while the objects in maz  apellniz et al.s ( 2014 ) study range from early o - type stars to early b - type objects ( see figure[fig6 ] ) .    from this comparison we conclude that the @xmath33 values that we derive are reliable , also for ums stars , confirming that for young massive stars our method is a solid and relatively simple way to study the amount and properties of the extinction from photometry alone , with no need for spectroscopy . provided that there are enough rc stars in the field and the level of extinction is high and variable , our method allows us to derive a robust extinction law and the absolute value of the extinction towards most ums and rc stars .",
    "the histograms in figure[fig9 ] also appear to indicate that , within the uncertainties , the maximum extinction value is substantially the same for ums and rc stars .",
    "however , we already know that some of the most extinguished rc objects are missing in our @xmath89-band photometry because it is shallower than in the other bands , thereby limiting the spread in the measured distribution . as discussed in section3 ,",
    "after an initial selection of candidates in each cmd , we retained as bona - fide rc stars only those classified as such in all cmds simultaneously .",
    "this is a necessary step to ensure that the derived extinction law is robust and accurate at all wavelengths , but it implies that the band with shallowest exposures ( @xmath89 in our case ) limits the most extinguished and hence faintest rc stars that we can retain in our sample . on the other hand , since we have already derived the extinction law , for the study of the reddening distribution we can rely on the cmds based on the deepest exposures .    to this end , we have used the @xmath91 _ vs. _ @xmath108 cmd of figure[fig6 ] , since in these bands the exposures are deeper and still sample a relatively wide spectral range ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "we have selected all the objects inside the strip shown in figure[fig6 ] , parallel to the reddening vector in this plane , with combined photometric uncertainty in the three bands @xmath110 .",
    "as before , we have excluded from the sample all stars with @xmath111 .",
    "there are a total of 381 objects satisfying these conditions : the 202 ums stars discussed above and 179 objects that have @xmath112 and are likely to be rc stars .",
    "most of them are the bona - fide rc objects discussed above , to which we have added the 45 stars indicated as thick circles in figure[fig6 ] .",
    "the histograms shown in figure[fig10 ] provide the distribution of the observed @xmath83 colours of these 381 stars . and",
    "@xmath113 bands do not exactly coincide with the johnson @xmath31 and @xmath32 bands , the difference is not significant in the context of the discussion that follows and we will ignore it . ]",
    "the solid line corresponds to the stars in the western half - field , where r136 is located , while the dashed line is for the objects in the eastern half - field .",
    "the arrows indicate the bluest expected colours of an ums or rc stars after the @xmath96 intervening mw extinction is taken into account .",
    "figure[fig10 ] confirms that in all cases the @xmath99 spread , calculated from the vertical arrows , is larger for rc stars than for ums stars , as we already concluded from figure[fig9 ] .",
    "in addition , here there are systematically more highly extinguished rc stars , which were not detected in the shallower @xmath89 band exposures and thus did not appear in figure[fig9 ] .",
    "zaritsky ( 1999 ) had concluded that , on average , in the lmc young stars are more obscured by dust than old stars , but this conclusion too was based on a sample of stars detected simultaneously in the @xmath89 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath91 bands . as mentioned above and as already pointed out by sabbi et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , this selection criterion penalizes the most extinguished evolved stars , thereby resulting in an incomplete reddening statistics .",
    "the presence of more extinguished rc stars than ums objects has important implications for the distribution of the absorbing material . in particular , the ums stars in our field are associated with r136 : they have a limited spatial distribution along the line of sight and their main source of extinction is the molecular cloud from which r136 formed .",
    "the presence of more extinguished rc stars indicates that the absorbing material is present along the line of sight also well behind r136 .",
    "also in the eastern half - field ( orange dashed line ) are the rc stars more heavily reddened than ums objects , but an important difference with respect to the western half - field is that here the minimum @xmath99 value towards rc stars is @xmath90 larger .",
    "this implies that there is an additional extinction component in front of the eastern half - field , roughly coinciding with the silhouette of a `` christmas tree '' in figure[fig1 ] .",
    "the most straightforward explanation is that the absorbing material in the christmas tree area is an outflow associated with a previous star formation episode in that area , some @xmath77myr ago .",
    "the outflow has been driven outward , towards the observer , by winds and supernova explosions from former massive stars through an opening in the confining molecular cloud . indeed , the region of the christmas tree coincides with a blue - shifted outflow with a velocity of 100kms@xmath64 ( chu & kennicutt 1994 ) , as one would expect from stellar winds and supernova explosions.the average density of the material and the associated column density are lower than in the original star forming region , as confirmed by the low emission at ir ( e.g. indebetouw et al . 2009 ) and radio wavelengths ( e.g. johansson et al . 1998 ; rubio et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the outflow extends in our direction and causes an appreciable extinction in the foreground .",
    "velocities in excess of 10kms@xmath64 are typical of the outflows powered by massive stars in orion ( _ e.g. , _",
    "bally 2007 ) , thus in 50myr or so this absorbing component has had time to extend few hundred parsec towards the observer and now affects also rc stars in the foreground of 30dor .",
    "conversely , rc stars in the foreground of r136 , in the western half - field , are not affected by this material and the extinction towards them is lower .",
    "previous hst observations ( de marchi et al .",
    "2011b ) have revealed a conspicuous population of @xmath114myr old pms stars in the eastern half - field , indicating that star formation was indeed ongoing in this area well before the birth of the r136 cluster .",
    "it is the @xmath115 stars belonging to that generation that were responsible for the injection of larger grains in the ism when they exploded as supernovae .",
    "the absence of objects with @xmath116 inside the christmas - tree region is evident in figure[fig11 ] , showing the spatial distribution of the rc stars across the entire field with progressively darker shades of grey . although there are 37 rc stars inside the area outlined by the dotted line , or 21% of the total , none of them have @xmath116 . in this region",
    "also stars with @xmath117 are missing , indicating that the total column density is lower than elsewhere in the field , in excellent agreement with the evacuated region revealed by the x ray observations of townsley et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in this area . in general , figure[fig11 ]",
    "provides a map of the column density towards all rc stars and , if the spatial density of these objects is known or is assumed to be uniform , it can be used to constrain the distribution of the absorbing material along the line of sight",
    ". this will be the topic of a forthcoming paper ( panagia & de marchi , in preparation ) .",
    "using wfc3 observations of the core of 30dor ( de marchi et al .",
    "2011a ) , we have studied the properties of interstellar extinction in the @xmath118 and @xmath54 bands over a field of @xmath119 including the central r136 cluster .",
    "we have taken advantage of the considerable and uneven levels of extinction in this field , which affect the colours and magnitudes of rc stars and spread them across the cmd . following the method developed in paperi , we have derived in an accurate and quantitative way both the extinction law @xmath39 in the wavelength range @xmath120 m and the values of the absolute extinction @xmath121 towards @xmath122 rc objects as well as @xmath123 o - type stars .",
    "the main results of this work can be summarised as follows .    1 .",
    "comparing our observations in all bands with the theoretical colours and magnitudes of rc stars , we define the region of the cmds where reddening can place rc stars . in this region",
    "we find a total of 146 objects detected in all optical bands and with a combined photometric uncertainty @xmath85mag , 93 of which are also detected in the nir bands covering a smaller area .",
    "we exclude from this sample 6 stars ( of which 3 in the nir ) that have @xmath111 as they could be contaminating pms stars .",
    "the resulting sample of bona - fide rc stars includes 140 objects , of which 90 also covered by the nir observations .",
    "we derive the best linear fit to the distribution of the bona - fide rc stars in all cmds , obtaining in this way the absolute extinction and the ratio @xmath73 between absolute and selective extinction in the specific wfc3 bands .",
    "interpolation at the wavelengths of the johnson @xmath31 and @xmath32 bands provides the extinction curve in the canonical form @xmath124 , in the range @xmath125 m .",
    "3 .   with @xmath42 ,",
    "the extinction law that we measure in r136 is considerably flatter than that of the diffuse galactic ism ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "furthermore , while the laws by cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , fitzpatrick & massa ( 1990 ) , and maz apellniz et al .",
    "( 2014 ) may provide a good fit to our extinction curve at optical wavelengths with @xmath9 suitably close to @xmath127 , none of them offers a good fit to the nir observations .",
    "instead , the extinction curve of r136 is best represented at optical wavelengths by the galactic curve shifted vertically by an offset of @xmath46 .",
    "longwards of @xmath45 m the extinction is very well matched by the galactic law multiplied by a factor of @xmath52 .",
    "this implies that in r136 the relative fraction of large grains is a factor of @xmath52 higher .",
    "we interpret the observed extinction curve as the result of an excess component of large grains added to the canonical grain distribution typical of the diffuse galactic ism .",
    "this is consistent with the selective injection by type ii supernova explosions of `` fresh '' large grains into a mw mix , as recently revealed by _",
    "herschel _ and _ alma _ observations of sn1987a .",
    "having derived the extinction curve in r136 , we study the relative distribution of stars and dust in the field by comparing the extinction towards individual rc and ums stars .",
    "the @xmath33 values measured towards 179 uniformly distributed rc stars provide a map of the column density in the region . the map is richly populated , since in the typical magellanic clouds hst field we can count on a surface density of 20 such stars per arcmin@xmath128 .",
    "we also study the extinction towards 202 ums stars and find that they span a narrower range of @xmath33 values than rc stars .",
    "the same result was found in paperi in a field located @xmath43 sw of the cluster .",
    "this is at odds with the conclusions of zaritsky ( 1999 ) , who found that in the lmc stars with @xmath129k are typically affected by larger extinction than stars with @xmath130k .",
    "we conclude that the apparent absence of heavily reddened evolved stars in zaritsky s ( 1999 ) sample was caused by a selection effect , namely by his exclusion of hard to detect stars from the @xmath89-band photometry .",
    "we compare the @xmath33 values obtained with our method with those derived spectroscopically by maz apellniz et al .",
    "( 2014 ) for a sample of 83 early type stars in the field .",
    "we find an excellent agreement , confirming the validity of our extinction determination not only for rc stars but also for o - type and b - type stars that are still on the ms .",
    "in summary , in this work we have shown that when the levels of extinction are high and uneven , like in the case of the 30dor region , rc stars can be used to derive the extinction law and the absolute extinction towards those stars with an accuracy comparable with that allowed by spectroscopy of early - type stars .",
    "furthermore , since rc stars sample in a uniform way a much larger volume than early - type stars , they can provide a characterisation of the extinction and a measure of the column density also outside the most active star forming regions and over multiple lines of sight .",
    "we have also shown that in the range @xmath120 m the extinction curve of r136 is not satisfactorily described by the widely used single - parameter families of extinction laws ( e.g. cardelli et al .",
    "1989 ; fitzpatrick & massa 1990 ) .",
    "this is not unexpected , since gordon et al .",
    "( 2003 ) had already shown that the the extinction curve in the lmc2 supershell around 30dor and along most lines of sight in the lmc do not follow the cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) relationship based on @xmath9 . in principle , it is practical to have a parametric description , but the extinction law is governed by the interplay of scattering and absorption due to grains with different physical properties , including chemical composition and size , and located in different environments .",
    "therefore , one wonders whether it is possible and meaningful to look for a mathematical formulation able to capture the complexity revealed by the observations , particularly when one needs to cover a wide spectral range .",
    "instead , it is very important to study the properties of the extinction curve in light of the current and recent star formation history experienced by the regions .",
    "so far our investigation using this method has covered two fields in the lmc , one containing r136 and one located @xmath43 sw of it .",
    "we are going to extend the study to the entire tarantula nebula , which was recently observed as part of the hubble tarantula treasury program ( sabbi et al .",
    "these observations sample a large contiguous area on the sky ( 168 arcmin@xmath128 ) in the range @xmath131 m and will allow us to also explore how smaller grains contribute to the extinction in regions with different intensity of the current and most recent star formation .",
