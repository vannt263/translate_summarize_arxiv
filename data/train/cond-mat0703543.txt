    "this orbital angular momentum is distinct from the photons intrinsic spin angular momentum @xcite . through it ,",
    "even linearly polarized light can exert a torque around the optical axis @xcite .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : transverse ] ) and  ( [ eq : phaseforce ] ) reveal the torque exerted by helical wavefronts to be a particular manifestation of the more general class of transverse forces arising when phase gradients redirect radiation pressure .",
    "intensity gradients also exert forces on illuminated objects @xcite . in this case , the dipole moment induced in the object responds to gradients in the field , yielding a force proportional to the gradient of the intensity . for a small sphere , this has the form @xcite , @xmath36 unlike the phase - gradient force , @xmath37 can be directed up the optical axis , and so can be used to form stable three - dimensional optical traps , despite axial radiation pressure .",
    "this is the basis for optical tweezers and related single - beam optical traps @xcite .",
    "forces due to intensity gradients are manifestly conservative @xcite , arising as they do from the gradient of an analytic function .",

    "this noteworthy property of scattering forces was pointed out by ashkin @xcite , but appears not to have been emphasized subsequently in the optical trapping literature .",

    "we demonstrate and characterize phase - gradient forces using the optimized holographic optical trapping technique @xcite and shape - phase holography @xcite to create extended optical traps with specified profiles for both their intensity and phase .",
    "our apparatus , shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic](a ) , uses a phase - only spatial light modulator ( hamamatsu x7690 - 16 ) to imprint computer - generated holograms on the wavefronts of a slightly converging @xcite beam of light provided by a solid - state laser ( coherent verdi 5w ) operating at a vacuum wavelength of 532  .",
    "the modified beam is relayed to an objective lens ( nikon plan apo , @xmath39 oil immersion , na 1.4 ) that focuses it into the intended three - dimensional optical trapping pattern .",
    "this objective lens is mounted in an inverted optical microscope ( nikon te-2000u ) , and the trapping beam is directed into the objective s input pupil with a wavelength selective polarizing beam splitter .",
    "light at other wavelengths passes through the beam splitter to form images on a ccd camera ( nec ti-324aii ) .",
    "the holograms used for this study are designed to bring the light to a focus along one - dimensional curves , @xmath40 , embedded in the three - dimensional focal volume of the objective lens .",
    "the hologram also encodes a designated intensity profile @xmath41 and phase profile @xmath42 along the arclength @xmath43 of @xmath40 .",
    "this is accomplished by numerically back - projecting @xcite the intended field along @xmath40 back to the plane of the slm to obtain the ideal complex - valued hologram , @xmath44 .",
    "the real - valued amplitude @xmath45 is defined to be non - negative by absorbing sign changes into the definition of the phase , @xmath46 .",

    "these images were obtained by placing a mirror in the microscope s focal plane and capturing an image of the reflected light . because these extended traps come to a diffraction - limited focus , their axial intensity gradients are steep enough to trap particles stably in three - dimensions against radiation pressure @xcite .",

    "the measured angle of inclination and its uniformity along @xmath55 confirm both the phase gradient s magnitude and also its uniformity .",
    "line traps with tunable linear phase gradients were projected into aqueous dispersions of colloidal silica spheres @xmath56 in diameter sealed into the 40  @xmath57thick gap between a glass microscope slide and a # 1 glass coverslip .",
    "the line traps were focused near the samples midplane to minimize both interference with reflections from the glass - water interface and also hydrodynamic coupling to the walls . in that case , the spheres viscous drag coefficient is reasonably approximated @xcite by the stokes value @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the viscosity of water .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : transverse ] ) and ( [ eq : phaseforce ] ) then suggest that a single sphere s speed , @xmath60 , along the line should be proportional to @xmath49 .    to test this prediction , we measured the time required for a single sphere to travel the line s length , @xmath48 , as the sign of @xmath49 was flipped 20 times for each value of @xmath61 .",
    "an estimated 100   of light formed the trap , after accounting for losses in the optical train .",
    "the observed off - line excursions of roughly 200   ( root - mean - squared ) suggest an axial and lateral trap stiffness comparable to that of a point - like optical tweezer powered by 1  . under these conditions ,",

    "more complicated phase gradients give rise to more interesting physical effects .",
    "the particles shown in fig .  [ fig : phasewell ] also are trapped along a uniformly bright line trap of length @xmath63 .",
    "this line , however , has a parabolic phase profile along its length , @xmath64 that is predicted to create either force objects toward the center of the line , or out to the ends , depending on the choice of sign . the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasewell ] also confirm this prediction .",
    "axial sections through the projected intensity pattern show that the phase - gradient barrier results from light diverging along the line s length , while the well results from the projection of converging rays onto the trap s length .",

    "[ fig : schematic](c ) , can be endowed with arbitrary phase profiles , including the uniform azimuthal phase gradient , @xmath68 , that defines a helical mode .",
    "a helical profile , by itself , causes a beam to focus into a ring of light , forming a torque - exerting optical trap known as an optical vortex @xcite . whereas the radius of an optical vortex is proportional to its helicity @xcite",
    ", holographic ring traps can be projected with any desired radius , independent of @xmath35 .",
    "this facilitates systematic studies of colloidal transport under varying phase gradients . also unlike optical vortices ,",
    "holographic ring traps come to a diffraction - limited focus , independent of @xmath35 , and therefore can trap micrometer - scale objects stably in three dimensions .",
    "this property can be seen in the computed axial section through a holographic ring trap shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : collapse](a ) .",
    "the section through the trap itself appears as two bright focal spots at the images mid - line .",
    "the ring s axial intensity gradients are comparable to those of a conventional optical tweezer , and so suffice to trap objects stably in three dimensions .",
    "this ring trap features a helicity of @xmath65 , and so is expected to exert a torque around the optical axis proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "the helical wavefront topology also suppresses the beam s axial intensity through destructive interference .",
    "consequently , none of the light projected by the objective lens appears along the beam s axis .",
    "rather , it is diverted to a radius , @xmath69 from the axis @xcite .",
    "provided that the ring trap s radius , @xmath70 , exceeds @xmath69 , the converging helical beam focuses not only to the intended ring trap in the focal plane , but also to two conventional optical vortices above and below the ring trap .",

    "the trapped particle was subjected to azimuthal phase gradients ranging from @xmath73 to @xmath74 , and its peak speed was measured @xcite to within 10% for each value of the helicity .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : collapse ] .    like optical vortices ,",
    "holographic ring trap are subject to @xmath35-fold and @xmath75-fold azimuthal intensity variations due to phase scaling errors @xcite .",
    "these create localized traps that compete with the intended phase - gradient force @xcite .",
    "consequently , the particle remains motionless for helicities below a threshold , @xmath76 .",
    "similar pinning due to intensity gradients appears in fig .  [",
    "fig : vdv ] . for @xmath77 , however , the particle s peak speed increases linearly with @xmath35 , consistent with the predictions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : transverse ] ) and ( [ eq : phaseforce ] ) . intermittent circulation near @xmath76 gives rise to large velocity fluctuations characterized by giant enhancement of the particle s effective diffusion coefficient @xcite .",
    "disorder in the effective force landscape also gives rise to interesting collective dynamics for multiple particles trapped on the ring , including transitions among periodic , chaotic and weakly chaotic steady states @xcite .",
    "phase - gradient forces in holographic ring traps therefore provide useful model systems for studying fundamental problems in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "they also promise practical applications as the basis for microscopic pumps @xcite , mixers @xcite , and optomechanical micromachines @xcite .",
    "the foregoing sections demonstrate that phase gradients in beams of light give rise to transverse forces arising from the redirection of radiation pressure .",
    "the existence of orbital angular momentum in beams of light and its transfer to illuminated objects can be seen to be manifestations of this general effect .    although phase - gradient forces may appear to be conservative on restricted manifolds , they are not conservative in general .",
    "non - conservative optical forces may give rise to interesting effects in illuminated particles dynamics , including departures from boltzmann statistics for systems nominally in equilibrium .",
    "such effects may substantially affect measurements of microscopic interactions and dynamics based on the statistics of optically trapped particles .",
    "they appear not to have been addressed in the large and rapidly growing literature in this area .",
    "we have demonstrated that phase - gradient forces can be used to craft one - dimensional force profiles in uniformly bright holographic line traps .",
    "these can be used to probe the interactions between multiple particles trapped on a line , including both intrinsic colloidal interactions and also light - induced interactions . this application for phase - gradient forces in holographic line traps",
    "will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the phase - gradient force in holographic line traps is subject to the abraham - minkowski controversy .",
    "extended line traps created with shape - phase holography therefore may provide useful model systems for probing how a medium influences the momentum flux of light .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that the polarization generally will vary with position in beams of light with spatially varying phase .",
    "although optically isotropic materials are not influenced by polarization gradients , anisotropic materials can be .",
