    "even though 4-neutrino models can not be ruled out as such , the resulting global fit of all current oscillation data is extremely poor  @xcite .",
    "the large solar mixing indicated by present data will lead to significant deformation of the energy spectra of supernova neutrinos , affecting the resulting signal  @xcite .",

    "last , but not least , note that neutrino oscillations are sensitive only to mass splittings , not to the absolute scale of neutrino mass , nor to whether neutrinos are dirac or majorana particles . the main process relevant to decide this fundamental issue is decay @xcite . the ` black - box theorem ` states that , in a `` natural '' gauge theory , irrespective of how is engendered , it implies a majorana neutrino mass , and vice - versa , as illustrated by fig .",

    "however it is unlikely that these phases can ever be reliably extracted from alone .",
    "the cp violation induced by the `` dirac '' phase is very hard to probe in oscillations , since it disappears as two neutrinos become degenerate @xcite and as @xmath74  @xcite .",
    "fortunately the lma solution helps , so with good luck , neutrino factories may probe leptonic cp violating effects , through the measurement of cp asymmetries  @xcite .",
    "basic uncertainties hinder the prediction of neutrino masses from first principles  @xcite : no knowledge of the underlying scale ( the scale of gravity / strings ?",
    "the gut scale ?",
    "an intermediate left - right scale ?",
    "the weak interaction scale itself ? ) , no knowledge of the underlying mechanism ( tree level ?",
    "hybrid ? ) and , last but not least , lack of a theory of flavor , which makes it especially difficult to make an honest prediction of mixing angles .",
    "nevertheless there has been an explosion of models in the last few years , most of which based on the so - called seesaw scheme  @xcite .",
    "an interesting of feature of such seesaw models is that the amount of lepton asymmetry produced in the early universe by the out  of  thermal  equilibrium decay of the right - handed neutrino may be enough to explain the current baryon - to - photon ratio of the universe  @xcite .",
    "this asymmetry arises from leptonic cp violation associated to the majorana nature of neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "various yukawa textures and gauge groups have been proposed in order to `` predict '' neutrino mixing angles in the seesaw approach , as described by king  @xcite . here",
    "i simply mention a few models from our own crop .",
    "they fall into two classes : ` top - down ` and ` bottom - up ` , and cover both ` hierarchical ` and ` quasi - degenerate ` neutrino mass spectra .",

    "mass and mixings has been suggested in @xcite .",
    "it consists in producing the atmospheric neutrino scale ` a la seesaw ` with just one 21 singlet lepton  @xcite . in this approximation two of the neutrinos",
    "are massless , their degeneracy being lifted by the gravitationally induced dimension-5 operator discussed above .",
    "the required neutrino parameters can be easily accommodated . since the solar scale comes from planck - mass effects ,",
    "the solar neutrino problem is explained by vacuum oscillations , which may be tested through the search for anomalous seasonal effects at borexino .",
    "i now turn to the possibility that neutrino masses may have an intrinsically supersymmetric origin , through the breaking of r ",

    "the bilinear terms lead to ` one ` tree level neutrino mass , chosen to lie in the range required by the atmospheric neutrino data , while calculable radiative contributions lift the degeneracy of the other neutrinos giving rise to the solar neutrino scale  @xcite .",
    "this provides the simplest , most predictive and systematic effective r  parity violation model at low  energies .",
    "its theoretical basis can be found either in the context of models where r ",
    "parity breaking is introduced explicitly ` ab initio `  @xcite , or in models where the violation of r  parity occurs ` spontaneously ` , through a non - zero 1 singlet sneutrino vacuum expectation value  @xcite .",
    "a recent example of the former kind was given in  @xcite using an anomalous u(1 ) horizontal symmetry which forbids all trilinear r - parity violating superpotential terms , selecting only the bilinear ones , and relating their strength @xmath81 to powers of the u(1 ) breaking parameter @xmath85 .",
    "this gives a common origin for the @xmath86term related to electroweak breaking and for the l - violating terms generating neutrino masses .",
    "the latter are suitable for explaining neutrino anomalies , though radiative contributions prefer the presently disfavored qvo solutions to the solar neutrino problem .",
    "this can be tested through the search for anomalous seasonal effects .",
    "the neutrino mixing angles are not suppressed by powers of @xmath87 and can naturally be large .",
    "spontaneous r ",
    "parity breaking models require the addition of 1 singlet superfields , e.  g.   right - handed neutrinos , and give a dynamical origin for the bilinear strength @xmath81 identified as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the dirac yukawa matrix .",
    "a characteristic feature of these models is the existence of an novel variant ( l=1 ) of the singlet seesaw majoron  @xcite .",
    "majoron emission induces `` invisible '' neutrino  @xcite and higgs boson decays  @xcite .",
    "the former are relevant in astrophysical environments  @xcite , while the latter lead to sizable higgs  to  missing  transverse ",
    "momentum signals  @xcite .",
    "in addition to explaining neutrino anomalies , supersymmetry with bilinear breaking of r  parity leads to a variety of phenomenological implications  @xcite .",

    "the smallness of the neutrino masses suppresses many of these effects in the most generic bilinear model of neutrino anomalies",
    ". however , there is at least one which survives and which may lead to a dramatic confirmation of the neutrino anomalies at high energy accelerator experiments such as the lhc or nlc : the decays of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",

    "note also that in such hybrid solution to the neutrino anomalies , with fc - nsi explaining the solar data , and oscillations accounting for the atmospheric data , the two sectors are connected not only by the neutrino mixing angle @xmath0 , but also by the -fc - nsi parameters . as a result nsi and oscillations may be confused , as shown in  @xcite .",

    "<S> i review the interpretation of solar and atmospheric neutrino data in terms neutrino oscillations and describe some ways to account for the required neutrino masses and mixing angles from first principles , both within top - down and bottom - up approaches . </S>",
    "<S> i also discuss non - oscillation phenomena such as which may probe the absolute scale of neutrino mass , and also reveal its majorana nature . </S>",
    "<S> i note that leptonic cp violation induced by `` majorana '' phases drop from oscillations but play a role in the leptogenesis scenario for the baryon asymmetry of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> direct tests of leptonic cp violation in oscillation experiments , such as neutrino factories , will be a tough challenge , due to the hierarchical neutrino mass splittings and the smallness of @xmath0 indicated by reactors . </S>",
    "<S> the large solar mixing angle @xmath1 offers a way to probe otherwise inaccessible features of supernova physics . </S>",
    "<S> finally , i note that in low - scale models of neutrino mass , one may probe ` all ` mixing angles , including the atmospheric @xmath2 , at high energy accelerator experiments such as the lhc or nlc . </S>",
    "<S> a neat example is supersymmetry with bilinear breaking of r parity , where the lsp decay branching ratios are directly correlated to the neutrino mixing angles . </S>",
    "<S> i also discuss non - oscillation solutions to the solar neutrino problem in terms of spin - flavor precession and non - standard neutrino interactions , which will be crucially tested at kamland . </S>"
