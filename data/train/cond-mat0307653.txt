    "the determination of carrier densities in semiconductors is usually carried out by hall measurements . in ferromagnetic semiconductors such as inmnas or gamnas",
    "however , the anomalous hall effect below the curie temperature , @xmath0 , can often times complicate the situation and make the determination of carrier density difficult .",
    "recently , several alternative methods for determining the carrier densities in ferromagnetic ( iii , mn)v semiconductors have been proposed .",
    "some of these include : raman spectroscopy,@xcite c - v measurements,@xcite and infrared optical conductivity.@xcite    in this paper , we propose that cylcotron resonance spectroscopy can sometimes be used to very accurately determine the density for inmnas - based magnetic structures .",
    "while the standard method for determining density from cyclotron resonance is to integrate the total absorption , in the iii - v dilute magnetic semiconductors , owing to the large amount of magnetic impurities , one must go to ultrahigh magnetic fields ( 40 t or more ) just to be able to observe the cyclotron resonance . as a result",
    ", there is sometimes a background signal which can influence the density determined this way . instead of using this standard method",
    ", we propose an alternative scheme based on using information which can be obtained from the cr resonant absorption such as the asymmetric lineshapes , and the positions and relative intensities of different cr absorption features .",
    "we show that the lineshapes , postions , relative intensities , and multiple transitions depend critically on the fermi energy and can thus allow one to accurately determine the carrier density .",

    ", we create a spin - dependent exchange potential which tends to confine the spin - up electrons in the inas layer and spin - down electrons in the inmnas layer .",

    "@xcite has been generalized to include superlattice effects due to the periodic mn doping profile , the wavevector ( k@xmath5 ) dependence of the electronic states , and the position dependent @xmath6-@xmath7 and @xmath8-@xmath7 exchange interactions with localized mn @xmath7-electrons .",
