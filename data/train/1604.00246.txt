    "the recent measurement from the advanced interferometric ligo detectors @xcite of the first direct gravitational - wave ( gw ) signal from what has been interpreted as the inspiral , merger and ringdown of a binary system of black holes @xcite marks , in many respects , the beginning of gw astronomy . as additional advanced detectors such as virgo @xcite , and kagra",
    "@xcite are going to become operational in the next few years , we are likely to soon witness also signals from the inspiral and post - merger of neutron - star binaries or neutron - star  black - hole binaries .",
    "such systems are not only excellent sources of gws , but also the most attractive scenario to explain the phenomenology associated with short gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ) . starting from the first suggestions that merging neutron stars could be behind these phenomena @xcite and supported by the circumstantial evidence coming from numerous astronomical observations ( see @xcite for a recent review ) ,",
    "numerical simulations have sharpened the contours of this scenario @xcite .",
    "what we now know rather reliably is that the merger of a binary neutron - star ( bns ) system inevitably leads to the formation of a massive metastable object , which can either collapse promptly to a black hole or survive up to thousands of seconds @xcite , emitting gravitational and electromagnetic radiation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if the neutron stars have large magnetic fields and extended magnetospheres , the inspiral can be accompanied by a precursor electromagnetic signal @xcite , while the merger can lead to instabilities @xcite and to the formation of magnetically confined jet structures once a torus is formed around the black hole @xcite . hence , the prospects of a multimessenger gravitational and electromagnetic signal are particularly good in the case of merger of binary neutron stars .",
    "in addition to a strong electromagnetic signal , the merger of a neutron - star binary also promises a gw signal that will contain important signatures of the equation of state ( eos ) of matter at nuclear densities .",
    "these signatures are contained both in the inspiral and in the post - merger signals .",
    "the former is reasonably well understood analytically @xcite and can be tracked accurately with advanced high - order numerical codes @xcite and over many orbits now @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the instantaneous gw frequency at amplitude maximum @xmath1 has been shown to correlate closely with the tidal deformability of the two stars @xcite .",
    "the latter part of the signal has already been studied in the past @xcite , but it has become the focus of attention particularly over the last few years @xcite .",
    "this large bulk of work has reached some generally agreed - upon conclusions , but also has raised points that are a matter of debate that we hope to clarify here .",
    "let us therefore start by summarising the aspects of the post - merger gw signal that seem to be robust and confirmed by several groups employing a variety of numerical methods and mathematical approximations .",
    "given a realistic bns system , namely , with a total mass between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and a mass difference between the two components that is @xmath4 or less , then the spectrum of the post - merger gw signal will present at least three strong peaks @xcite .",
    "these peaks were dubbed @xmath5 and @xmath6 in refs .",
    "@xcite and were found to satisfy the following approximate relation : @xmath7 .",
    "a simple mechanical toy model was also presented in @xcite , that provided an intuitive explanation on the origin of these peaks and why they should be almost equally spaced .",
    "in addition to these three peaks , another peak can be identified in the power spectral density ( psd ) of the gw signal , although not always .",
    "this is given by the coupling between the @xmath8 fundamental mode ( which yields the @xmath9 peak ) and a quasi - radial ( fundamental ) axisymmetric mode , i.e. ,  with @xmath10 ; this mode was dubbed @xmath11 in ref .",
    "finally , ref .",
    "@xcite introduced the concept of the @xmath12 peak frequency and associated it to a `` rotating pattern of a deformation of spiral shape '' .",
    "it is difficult to measure this motion in a numerical - relativity calculation without the possible contamination of spatial - gauge effects ; however , as we will show in the following , @xmath12 coincides with @xmath13 in the large majority of the cases so that , in the end , the strongest and most robust features of the post - merger signal are confined to four frequencies : @xmath14 , and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "in addition to selecting the most salient spectral features of the post - merger gw signal , the analyses of refs . @xcite have also tried to associate the values of these frequencies to the stellar properties of the two stars before the merger and hence to their eos .",
    "this was initiated by refs .",
    "@xcite , who showed that @xmath9 correlated with the radius of the maximum - mass nonrotating configuration ; the correlation found was rather tight , but restricted to binaries having all the same total mass of @xmath15 @xcite ; later on , the correlation was explored also when considering a larger sample of masses @xcite , and it was noted that the correlation was not as tight as previously expected .",
    "indeed , refs .",
    "@xcite discovered that the correlations of the @xmath9 peaks with the radius of the maximum - mass nonrotating configuration depend on the total mass of the system and hence are not `` universal '' in the sense of being only weakly dependent on the eos ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . at the same time , refs .",
    "@xcite showed that the @xmath13 peak is correlated with the total compactness of the stars in a quasi - universal manner , and highlighted a number of other correlations ( 24 different ones were presented in fig .",
    "15 of @xcite ) ; some of these correlations had been already presented in the literature , e.g. ,  in refs .",
    "@xcite , while most of them were presented there for the first time .",
    "more specifically , correlations were found between @xmath16 and @xmath9 frequencies and the physical quantities of the binary system , e.g. ,  the stellar compactness , the average density , or the dimensionless tidal deformability ( some of these correlations will be further discussed below ) .",
    "some of the results reviewed above are robust , while other are less so .",
    "in particular , although the interpretation of the largest peak in the spectrum is normally attributed to the @xmath8 mode of the hmns , the interpretation of the low - frequency peak ( or peaks ) is still subject to debate .",
    "more specifically , it is unclear whether such a peak ( or peaks ) correlates in a `` universal '' manner with the stellar properties , as shown in @xcite for the @xmath13 peak , or not , as shown in @xcite for the @xmath12 peak .    the purpose of this paper is to try and clarify this debate and , more specifically , to show that for the cases considered here the @xmath17 frequency either coincides with the @xmath13 frequency or falls in a part of the psd of the signal where no significant power can be found , thus explaining why no universal behaviour was found in ref .",
    "we reach this conclusion by extending the sample of binaries considered in refs .",
    "@xcite to include the fully general - relativistic simulations of the very low - mass binaries with total mass @xmath18 and that were suggested by @xcite to be missing in our sample .",
    "in addition , we also consider the largest masses that can be supported for a timescale after the merger sufficiently long to yield an accurate spectrum ; depending on the eos , these masses can be as large as @xmath19 .",
    "the large majority of binaries have equal masses , but we consider also four different instances of unequal - mass binaries with mass difference of about @xmath0 .",
    "this complete sample of binaries , which counts a total of 56 binaries and doubles the sample presented in @xcite , is arguably the largest studied to date with nuclear - physics eoss and in full general relativity ( a sample of comparable size but not in full general relativity was already presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . after a systematic analysis of the complete sample ,",
    "it was possible to sharpen a number of arguments on the spectral properties of the gw signal and that can be summarised as follows :    * the gw frequency at amplitude maximum @xmath1 is related to quasi - universally with the tidal deformability of the two stars ; this correlation is strong for equal - mass binaries and holds as long as the binaries have masses that do not differ of more than @xmath0 .",
    "* the post - merger signal is characterised by a transient phase lasting a few millisecond after the merger , which is then followed by quasi - stationary phase . * the spectral properties of the gw signal vary during the post - merger phase with a marked difference between the transient and the quasi - stationary phase . *",
    "spectrograms are particularly useful when selecting spectral features in the transient phase because peaks that appear in the short transient , may be subdominant when analysed in terms of the full psd . * when distinguishing the spectral peaks between the transient and quasi - stationary phases ,",
    "a number of ambiguities in the identification of the peaks disappear , leaving a rather simple and robust picture ; * the strongest and most robust features of the post - merger signal are confined to four frequencies : @xmath14 , and @xmath11 , where @xmath7 and @xmath11 is the result of a mode coupling . *",
    "a number of `` universal '' relations can be found between the main spectral features and the physical properties of the neutron stars .",
    "* for all of the correlations found , simple analytic expressions can be given either in terms of the dimensionless tidal deformability or of the stellar compactness .    when considered as a whole ,",
    "these results support the idea that the equation of state of nuclear matter can be tightly constrained when a strong post - merger signal in gws is measured .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ sec : ns ] provides a very brief summary of the mathematical and numerical methods used to obtain our results in full general relativity , while sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] is dedicated to the illustration of our results .",
    "in particular , in sects . [ sec : wp_ts ] , [ sec : wp_qss ] , and [ sec : wp_aotfpsd ] we concentrate on the waveform properties coming from transient signals , quasi - stationary signals and from the analysis of the full psds , respectively . the analysis of the correlations of the spectral signatures with the stellar properties is instead presented in sect . [",
    "sec : wp_cwsp ] , while sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions and future prospects .",
    "three different appendices offer details on the full set of binaries considered ( appendix [ appendix_a ] ) , on the analysis of some modes ( appendix [ appendix_b ] ) or on a two - dimensional fit employed in our analysis ( appendix [ appendix_c ] ) .",
    "the mathematical and numerical setup used for the simulations reported here is the same discussed in @xcite and presented in greater detail in other papers @xcite . for completeness we review here only the basic aspects , referring the interested reader to the papers above for additional information .",
    "all of our simulations have been performed in full general relativity using a fourth - order finite - differencing code ` mclachlan ` @xcite , which solves a conformal traceless formulation of the einstein equations @xcite , with a `` @xmath20 '' slicing condition and a `` gamma - driver '' shift condition @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the general - relativistic hydrodynamics equations are solved using the finite - volume code ` whisky ` @xcite , which has been extensively tested in simulations involving the inspiral and merger of bnss @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamics equations are solved employing the harten - lax - van leer - einfeldt ( hlle ) @xcite approximate riemann solver @xcite , which is less accurate but more robust , in conjunction with a piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) for the reconstruction of the evolved variables @xcite . for the time integration of the coupled set of the hydrodynamic and einstein equations",
    "we have used the method of lines ( mol ) in conjunction with an explicit fourth - order runge - kutta method @xcite . in all our simulations",
    "we prescribe a courant - friedrichs - lewy ( cfl ) factor of @xmath21 to compute the size of the timestep .",
    "we employ an adaptive - mesh refinement ( amr ) approach that follows closely the one adopted in @xcite and where the grid hierarchy is handled by the ` carpet ` mesh - refinement driver @xcite .",
    "it implements vertex - centered mesh refinement , also known as the box - in - box method , and allows for regridding during the calculation as well as multiple grid centres .",
    "the timestep on each grid is set by the courant condition and by the spatial grid resolution for that level .",
    "boundary data for finer grids are calculated with spatial prolongation operators employing fifth - order polynomials and with prolongation in time employing second - order polynomials .    during the inspiral",
    ", a grid with the finest refinement and fully covering each star is centred at the position of the maximum rest - mass density .",
    "the grid hierarchy is composed of six refinement levels and a @xmath22 refinement factor for successive levels .",
    "the grid resolution varies from @xmath23 ( i.e. ,  @xmath24 ) for the finest level , to @xmath25 ( i.e. ,  @xmath26 ) for the coarsest level , whose outer boundary is at @xmath27 ( i.e. ,  @xmath28 ) . to reduce computational costs in the case of equal - mass binaries , which represent the large majority of our sample , the grid structure",
    "is then replicated employing a @xmath29-symmetric , i.e. ,  a symmetry of @xmath30 degrees around the @xmath31-axis - symmetry being imposed , finding no appreciable differences in the position ( in frequency ) of the main peaks of the psds . at the same time , the amplitude of such peaks can vary ( up to @xmath4 ) and the psd without @xmath29-symmetry naturally shows more power at higher frequencies as these are not suppressed by the symmetry . ] . independently of the mass ratio , the whole grid is set up to be symmetric with respect to the @xmath32 plane both for equal- and unequal - mass binaries , with a reflection symmetry across the @xmath33 plane , again to reduce computational costs .",
    "the number of grid points across the linear dimension of a star is of the order of @xmath34 , and this is roughly doubled when the merger has taken place and a hmns has been formed .",
    "the boundary conditions are chosen to be `` radiative '' for the metric in order to prevent gws ( or other numerical perturbations ) from scattering back into the grid , and `` static '' for the hydrodynamical variables .",
    "finally , we recall that in ref .",
    "@xcite we have carried out a resolution study to assess the influence of the resolution on the spectral properties . by comparing the results with higher and lower resolutions , we have found that the use of a `` medium '' resolution of @xmath23 is sufficient to provide numerically robust measurements of the peaks , that is , peaks which differ of a few per - cent only from those obtained with higher resolutions ( see section iv a of @xcite ) .      as in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "we model the stars with five `` cold '' ( i.e. ,  at zero temperature ) nuclear - physics eoss : i.e. ,  apr4 @xcite , alf2 @xcite , sly @xcite , h4 @xcite and gnh3 @xcite .",
    "all of these eoss satisfy the current observational constraint on the observed maximum mass in neutron stars , i.e. ,  @xmath35 obtained for the pulsar psr j0348 + 0432 @xcite .",
    "in addition , to validate the results also across `` hot '' eoss , we consider two binaries described by the lattimer - swesty eos @xcite , with nuclear compressibility parameter @xmath36 ( ls220 ) ; these binaries were first studied in @xcite , where additional information on their dynamics can be found .",
    "the nuclear - physics eoss are normally provided in tabular form , but it is more convenient numerically to express them in terms of a number of piecewise polytropes @xcite .",
    "four different `` pieces '' are normally sufficient to reproduce to good precision most of the eoss , with three of the pieces describing the high - density core and one the crustal region ; we refer to table i of ref .",
    "@xcite for a list of the properties of the various piecewise polytropes used here .",
    "the cold nuclear - physics eoss also need to be supplemented by a `` hot '' contribution that accounts for the considerable increase in the internal energy at the merger .",
    "this is normally done through a so - called `` hybrid eos '' @xcite , in which an ideal - fluid component that accounts for the shock heating is added to the cold part @xcite . in practice",
    "the total pressure and specific internal energy are expressed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 are given by cold nuclear - physics eoss ( expressed as piecewise polytropes ) , while the `` thermal '' part is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is obtained through the solution of the hydrodynamics equations and @xmath41 is arbitrary , but constrained mathematically to be @xmath42 .",
    "after some experimentation carried out in @xcite , we have concluded that values @xmath43 do not introduce a significant variance in the spectral properties of the gw signal and we have therefore chosen @xmath44 for consistency with the single polytrope ( see discussion in sect .",
    "iv b. in @xcite ) .",
    "the initial data in our simulations represents quasi - equilibrium irrotational bnss and is computed with the multi - domain spectral - method code ` lorene ` @xcite under the assumption of a conformally flat spacetime metric .",
    "all binaries have an initial coordinate separation between the stellar centres of @xmath45 , which yields at least four orbits ( or more ) before the merger .",
    "the choice of the masses for the binaries is constrained by two considerations .",
    "the first one is that , given the substantial computational costs of these simulations we need to consider masses that are realistic , rather than masses that give , for instance , the largest mass difference ; in practice , this implies that our masses are around @xmath46 , which indeed we take as our fiducial mass .",
    "the second consideration is that in order to model the post - merger reliably we need an hmns that survives for a sufficiently large amount of time before collapsing to a black hole ( e.g. ,  at least @xmath47 ) ; stated differently , binaries with these eoss and masses larger than @xmath48 , are not optimal for the post - merger analysis although we use them to have the largest possible sample .    as a result of these considerations , for each cold eos , we have considered ten equal - mass binaries with average ( gravitational ) mass at infinite separation in the range @xmath49 for the apr4 , alf2 , gnh3 , h4 , and sly eoss . ] .",
    "furthermore , as a complement to our set of equal - mass binaries , we have also considered four unequal - mass binaries with @xmath50 and mass ratio @xmath51 and @xmath52 and mass ratio @xmath53 ; these unequal - mass binaries have been chosen for the gnh3 and sly eoss as examples of stiff and soft eoss , respectively . the sample is completed by two equal - mass binaries with masses @xmath54 and described by the the hot ls220 eos .",
    "detailed information on all the models and their properties is collected in table [ tab : models ] of appendix [ appendix_a ] .",
    "the gw signal is extracted at different surfaces of constant coordinate radius using the newman - penrose formalism , so that the gw polarization amplitudes @xmath55 and @xmath56 are related to weyl curvature scalar @xmath57 by ( see sect .",
    "iv of ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) @xmath58 where the overdot indicates a time derivative and we have introduced the ( multipolar ) expansion of @xmath57 in spin - weighted spherical harmonics @xcite of spin - weight @xmath59 . in practice , all of our analysis is limited to the dominant mode , i.e. ,  the @xmath60 mode @xmath61 where @xmath62 are the spin - weighted spherical harmonics .",
    "following previous work @xcite , we align the waveforms at the `` time of merger '' , which we set to be @xmath63 and define to be correspondent to the time when the gw amplitude @xmath64 reaches its first maximum . as a result , for most binaries we consider gw signals in the time interval @xmath65\\ , { m_{\\odot}}\\approx [ -7.39,24.63 ] { \\,{\\rm ms}}$ ] .",
    "after defining the instantaneous frequency of the gw as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the phase of the complex gravitational waveform @xcite .",
    "the time of the merger is also used to define the `` frequency at amplitude maximum '' ( or peak frequency in ref .",
    "@xcite ) as @xmath68 .",
    "another quantity used extensively in our analysis is the psd of the effective amplitude and defined as @xmath69 with @xmath70 and where the @xmath71 and @xmath72 indices refer to the two polarization modes . using this psd",
    ", we can compute the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) as @xmath73^{1/2}\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath74 being the noise psd of a given gw detector [ e.g. ,  advanced ligo @xcite , or the einstein telescope ( et ) @xcite ] .",
    "figure [ waveform_5x7 ] provides a summarising view of some of the waveforms ( i.e. ,  of @xmath75 for sources at a distance of @xmath76 ) computed in this paper and that are combined with those of @xcite to offer a more comprehensive impression of the gw signal across different masses and eoss .",
    "the figure is composed of 35 panels referring to the 35 equal - mass binaries with nuclear - physics eoss that we have simulated and that have a postmerger signal of at least @xmath77 ; binaries with shorter post - merger ( e.g. ,  ` alf2-q10-m1400 ` ) and unequal - mass ( e.g. ,  ` gnh3-q09-m1300 ` ) are not reported in the figure but their properties are listed in table [ tab : models ] .",
    "different rows refer to models with the same mass , while different columns select the five cold eoss considered and colour - coded for convenience .",
    "it is then rather easy to see how small differences across the various eoss during the inspiral become marked differences after the merger . in particular , it is straightforward to observe how the gw signal increases considerably in frequency after the merger and how low - mass binaries with stiff eoss ( e.g. ,  top - left panel for the gnh3 eos ) show a qualitatively different behaviour from high - mass binaries with soft eoss ( e.g. ,  bottom - right panel for the apr4 eos ) . also quite apparent is that , independently of the mass considered , the post - merger amplitude depends sensitively on the stiffness of the eos , with stiff eoss ( e.g. ,  gnh3 ) yielding systematically larger amplitudes than soft eoss ( e.g. ,  apr4 ) .",

    "also marked with horizontal line of different type and colour are the various frequencies that have been so far discussed in the literature when describing the spectral properties of the gw signal .",
