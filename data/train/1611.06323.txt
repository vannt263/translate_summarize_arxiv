    "the onset in that panel shows the spectrum at @xmath171  ev for an ir field covering @xmath173 cycles to overlap with the xuv pulse at this frequency . since one can barely see sb@xmath139 and only the signals at ml and sb@xmath137 are visible for the chosen pulse parameters , we present the asymmetry at just ml and  sb@xmath137 .",
    "the asymmetry at sb@xmath137 exhibits a broad and steady increase , starting from about @xmath174 at @xmath175  ev and ending at almost @xmath176 at @xmath177  ev . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:7](b ) , this variation depends only weakly on the ir intensity , as opposed to the asymmetry at ml , which clearly shows an asymmetric resonance profile whose amplitude increases as a function of the ir intensity .",
    "the cause of the resonance profile at ml is actually indirect : as the ir frequency  @xmath16 approaches the resonance , a transfer of population from @xmath10 occurs , thereby decreasing the two - photon ionization pathway and ultimately modifying the value of the asymmetry .",
    "consequently , one can control the asymmetry amplitudes by varying the ir intensity and frequency .",
    "the latter effect could , for instance , be exploited experimentally to control the resonance profile without having to vary the amplitude ratio between the xuv harmonics , which is a difficult task to achieve in practice .",
    "nevertheless , a complication arises in the present situation due to the fact that the system only needs to absorb two ir photons to ionize from the @xmath178 excited state of neon . as a result ,",
    "near - threshold ionization might become important for large ir intensities and could hinder good statistics of the experimental data .",
    "thus , it seems preferable to use this scheme on a more strongly bound electronic state , for which multiphoton ionization would remain negligible .",
    "finally , note that for large ir frequencies in fig .",
    "[ fig:7](b ) , the asymmetries in ml and sb@xmath137 differ significantly .",
    "it might then be possible , by appropriately varying  @xmath17 , to create a situation when the asymmetries of ml and sb@xmath137 have opposite signs , i.e. , a situation in which electrons of two different lines have opposite preferred emission directions with a resolvable energy difference .",
    "this strong difference in the asymmetry between ml and sb@xmath137 contradicts the sfa prediction .",
    "the difference is most probably due to the @xmath179 and @xmath180 pathways to sb@xmath137 , which can not be adequately described in the sfa approach .",
    "we have presented a detailed investigation of above - threshold ionization effects induced by an infrared field on two - pathway interference between a nonresonant one - photon and resonant two - photon ionization of neon .",
    "the characteristics of the sidebands in the photoelectron spectrum were analyzed at several infrared laser intensities by numerically solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "the numerical results were qualitatively supported by analytical formulas derived from a model based on the strong - field approximation .    the ionization probability and the anisotropy parameters characterizing the angular distribution at each band agree well with each other in both models .",
    "the anisotropy parameters of the photoelectron angular distribution exhibit oscillations , which should be measurable experimentally .",
    "an important result of our study is that for long pulses the left - right asymmetry at each sideband should not depart strongly from the asymmetry created at the main photoelectron line in the absence of infrared field . as the infrared intensity",
    "is increased , variations of the asymmetry are shown to become significant for relatively strong fields , where the ionization signal at each band should be harder to detect .",
    "in fact , in the strong - field approximation , the asymmetry is predicted to be constant , independent of the sideband order and the infrared pulse intensity , i.e. , the infrared field transfers the asymmetry of the main photoelectron line to the different sidebands .",
    "an interesting situation may occur if the infrared frequency is set in resonance with a nearby optically allowed electronic state . in such a case , the infrared field can play an active role in the ionization process .",
    "we have shown that the pumping of population from @xmath102 to @xmath178 results in a resonance profile of the asymmetry at the mainline as a function of the infrared frequency .",
    "furthermore , the amplitude of the resonance profile at the main line increases with growing infrared intensity .",
    "the asymmetry of the lowest high - energy band exhibits the most interesting variation , since it changes significantly with the infrared frequency in a monotonic fashion . on the other hand",
    ", it merely varies as a function of the infrared intensity .",
    "initial experiments to reveal some of the features provided by the infrared field were already performed at the fermi free - electron laser facility in trieste ( italy ) , and future experiments could use such effects to improve control of the photoelectron angular distribution .",
    "the authors benefited greatly from stimulating discussions with giuseppe sansone , michael meyer , elena gryzlova , and nikolay kabachnik .",
    "the work of n.d .  and k.b .",
    "was supported by the united states national foundation under grant and the xsede allocation .",
