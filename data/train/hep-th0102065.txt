    "there are various superstring effective theories ( type i , type iia , type iib and heterotic @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) which can be represented by effective actions with suitable field equations which generalize general relativity . in view of duality symmetry the superstring effective actions are not necessarily the right description of physics at strong coupling , where string coupling parameter @xmath2 .",
    "it appears that at strong coupling regime the physics is 11-dimensional and can be described by m - theory with its low - energy limit ",
    "11-dimensional supergravity .",
    "one of the proposals for m - theory is hoava - witten theory .",
    "the main issue of this talk is to discuss the question about the implications of superstring / m - theory onto the evolution of the universe .",
    "let us start with the presentation of superstring effective actions .",
    "the first action under consideration is type * iia superstring * effective action .",
    "it has @xmath3 supersymmetries of opposite chirality and reads @xcite @xmath4 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\int b_2 \\wedge f_4 \\wedge f_4 \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the ricci scalar curvature of the spacetime with metric @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the fundamental string length .",
    "strings sweep out geodesic surfaces with respect to the metric @xmath6 .",
    "the antisymmetric tensor field strengths are defined by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denote antisymmetric @xmath14form potentials and @xmath15 is the exterior derivative .",
    "the last term in ( [ iia ] ) is a chern ",
    "simons term and is a necessary consequence of supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "ns sector of the action contains the graviton , @xmath6 , the antisymmetric 2form potential , @xmath16 , and the dilaton field , @xmath17 .",
    "the rr sector contains antisymmetric @xmath14form potentials , where @xmath14 is odd .",
    "ns sector couples directly to the dilaton , but the rr fields do not .    the bosonic type * iib superstring * effective theory has @xmath3 supersymmetries of the same chirality and its action reads @xmath18 + \\int a_4 \\wedge h_3^{(2 ) } \\wedge h_3^{(1 ) } \\right\\ } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the bosonic massless excitations arising in the ns ",
    "ns sector are the dilaton , @xmath17 , the metric , @xmath6 , and the antisymmetric , 2form potential , denoted here by @xmath19 .",
    "the rr sector contains a scalar axion field , @xmath20 , a 2form potential , @xmath21 ( we dropped a 4form potential , @xmath22 here ) and the rr field strengths are defined by @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    in heterotic superstring theories supersymmetry",
    "is imposed only in the right - moving sector so these theories are @xmath25 supersymmetric .",
    "quantization of the left - moving sector requires the gauge groups to be either @xmath1 or @xmath0 and the choice of the group depends on the boundary conditions .",
    "the * heterotic superstring * effective action reads [ het ] s_h= d^10 x e^- where @xmath26 is the field strength corresponding to the gauge groups @xmath27 or @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the field strength of a 2-form potential , @xmath16 .",
    "the last of the superstring theories is an open string theory or type i theory .",
    "because of the obvious reason ( left and right moving sectors must be the same ) it has @xmath25 supersymmetry and the effective action reads [ i ] s_i = d^10x where @xmath30 is the yang  mills field strength taking values in the gauge group @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the field strength of a 2form potential , @xmath16 .",
    "we note that this field strength is not coupled to the dilaton field in this frame and since both actions ( [ het ] ) and ( [ i ] ) have the same particle content this is the only difference between the two theories .",
    "it is not difficult to notice that all the above theories ( [ iia])-([i ] ) in the string frame have the common sector which ( except different coupling of @xmath33 in type i ) is [ com10 ] s = d^10x  e^- . in particular , ( [ com10 ] ) represents a weak coupling limit ( @xmath34 ) of heterotic @xmath0 theory .",
    "it is also the zeroth ",
    "order expansion in both the string coupling @xmath35 and the inverse string tension @xmath36 .",
    "the common sector ( [ com10 ] ) , after a suitable dimensional reduction to 4 dimensions on a constant calabi - yau manifold , gives the following elementary cosmological solutions for flat isotropic friedmann geometry ( with no axion @xmath37 ) [ pbbsolns ] a(t ) & = & t ^ , + e^(t ) & = & t ^ - 1 , where @xmath38 is the scale factor and @xmath17 the dilaton .",
    "these solutions led to the cosmological scenario which is called pre - big - bang cosmology @xcite .",
    "it is easy to notice that the solutions ( [ pbbsolns ] ) admit a phase of expansion for _  negative _ times as well as for positive times ( with the singularity formally located at @xmath39 ) .",
    "it is both a curvature singularity ( ricci scalar diverges ) and a string coupling singularity @xmath40 .    from ( [ pbbsolns ] )",
    "we realize that there are four possible types of the evolution for the scale factor together with four corresponding types of evolution for the dilaton . these with ` - ' sign in ( [ pbbsolns ] ) will be numbered as * 1 * and * 2 * while those with ` + ' sign in ( [ pbbsolns ] ) will be numbered as * 3 * and * 4*. all of them are commonly called branches .",
    "branches * 1 * and * 3 * apply for negative times ( @xmath41 ) while branches * 2 * and * 4 * apply for positive times ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the four types of evolution are connected by the underlying symmetry of string theory namely @xmath43 ( also called o(d , d ) symmetry @xcite ) which in the context of isotropic cosmology is called scale factor duality ( sfd ) .",
    "its mathematical realization is given by the relation which interchange the scale factor and the dilaton , leaving field equations unchanged , i.e. , [ sfd ] a(t ) , + ( t ) ( t ) - .",
    "sfd relates * 1 * and * 3 * or * 2 * and * 4 * whose domains are either for @xmath41 or @xmath44 .",
    "however , there is also time - reflection symmetry    [ timeref ] t - t ,    which together with sfd gives relation beetween * 1 * and * 4 * as follows [ tref ] a_1(t ) = ( -t)^- t^ = .",
    "it is easy to show that for branch * 1 * > 0 , which means that it describes inflation which undergoes without a _ violation of the energy conditions _ and it is called superinflation . this comes form the fact that there is only _ kinetic term _ for the dilaton in the action ( [ com10 ] ) and there is no potential energy at all .",
    "let us remind that standard inflation is potential - energy - driven inflation .",
    "it is easy to notice that the branch * 4 * is deflationary , i.e. , < 0 , and it describes standard _ radiation - dominated _ evolution .",
    "branches * 1 * and * 4 * are duality - related , though , they are divided by the singularity of curvature and strong coupling . the solutions with axion",
    "are qualitatively the same  still there is a curvature singularity and strong coupling singularity though a bounce of the scale factor @xmath45 appears @xcite .",
    "there are some problems with pre - big - bang scenario .",
    "one of the most interesting is that in the conformally related einstein frame the action ( [ com10 ] ) is the same as the einstein relativity minimally coupled to a scalar field ( or stiff fluid pressure = energy density ) and the solutions for negative times @xmath41 are just collapsing solutions and no superinflation is present .",
    "another is the so - called `` graceful - exit '' problem which is a possible physical mechanism for a transition from superinflation to a radiation - dominated universe .",
    "an interesting issue appears if one considers less symmetric geometries like homogeneous bianchi or kantowski - sachs type models . in that case",
    "a choice of the antisymmetric tensor potential is unclear since one is possible to make it timely ( @xmath46 ) or spatially ( @xmath47 ) dependent .",
    "the first case ( though makes energy momentum tensor time - dependent only ) can not be admitted to some geometries and even if it can , it may prevent isotropization of the universe for late times which is observationally unfavourable .",
    "m - theory is defined as strong coupling limit of superstring theories .",
    "it is 11-dimensional and it has got as a weak coupling limit 11-dimensional supergravity with the action @xmath48 \\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ \\left .",
    "+ \\frac{1}{6 } \\int a_3 \\wedge f_4 \\wedge f_4 , \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is 11-dimensional newton constant and the chern  simons term arises as a direct consequence of the ( @xmath25 ) supersymmetry .",
    "it has been shown that the compactification of @xmath25 , @xmath50 supergravity on a circle , @xmath51 , results in the type iia supergravity theory which was interpreted as the strongly coupled limit of the type iia superstring ( with @xmath3 supersymmetries ) in terms of an 11-dimensional theory .",
    "this correspondence gave hoava and witten @xcite the idea that one can also compactify eleven - dimensional supergravity on a @xmath52 orbifold ( which is a unit interval @xmath53 ) in order to get a heterotic theory with only @xmath25 supersymmetry .",
    "other words , they proved that the 10-dimensional @xmath0 theory results from an 11-dimensional theory compactified on the orbifold @xmath54 in the same way as the type iia theory results from an 11-dimensional theory compactified on @xmath55 .",
    "this identifies strongly coupled limit of heterotic @xmath0 theory as 11-dimensional supergravity compactified on an orbifold .",
    "the action for such a theory reads as [ shw ] s = s_sugra + s_ym , where [ sym ] s_ym = - ( ) ^ \\ { _ m^(1)_10 + _ m^(2)_10 } . the action ( [ sym ] ) is composed of the two @xmath56 yang - mills theories on 10-dimensional orbifold fixed planes",
    " manifolds @xmath57 ( i = 1,2 ) and @xmath58 are the two gauge field strengths .",
    "for further cosmological investigations we can compactify hoava - witten models on a calabi - yau deformed manifold @xmath59 with orbifold coordinate to make decomposition @xmath60 . it is important that the size of the orbifold is much bigger than the radius of the calabi - yau space and we can discuss 5-dimensional effective theory with the action @xcite [ shwg ] s = _ m_5 ( r - ( ) ^2 - _ 0 ^ 2 e^-2 ) + _",
    "i=1 ^ 2 _ m^(i)_4 _ 0 e^- , where @xmath61",
    "are orbifold fixed planes , @xmath62 is a scalar field ( dilaton ) which parametrizes the radius of calabi - yau space and @xmath63 is the pull - back of 5-dimensional metric onto @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in the action ( [ shwg ] ) we dropped other important fields like p - form fields , gravitini ,",
    "rr scalar and fermions .",
    "the effective field equations for the action ( [ shwg ] ) are ( @xmath66 ) @xmath67 \\left [ \\delta(y ) - \\delta(y - \\pi \\lambda ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath68 .",
    "\\label{eom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in ( [ eom ] ) @xmath69 $ ] is a coordinate in the orbifold direction and the orbifold fixed planes are at @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath71 acts on @xmath51 by @xmath72 .",
    "the terms involving delta functions arise from the stress energy on the boundary planes .    before going further we present the form of 11-dimensional metric for our cosmological solutions which is ds_11 ^ 2 = e^- g_dx^dx^ + e^ _ mndy^mdy^n , and @xmath73 so that the last term is simply calabi - yau metric .",
    "the 5-dimensional metric is given by ds_5 ^ 2 = g_dx^dx^ = -n^2(,y)d^2 + ds_3 ^ 2 + d^2(,y)dy^2 , and our main task in this paper is to consider the most general form of the 3-metric of homogeneous type bianchi ix ( or mixmaster ) @xmath74 where the orthonormal forms @xmath75 are given by @xmath76 and the angular coordinates @xmath77 span the following ranges , @xmath78 one should notice that under a choice @xmath79 one gets bianchi type i flat geometry .",
    "similarly as in @xcite we will look for separable solutions of the form [ separable ] n(,y ) & = & n ( ) ( y ) , + a(,y ) & = & ( ) ( y ) , + b(,y ) & = & ( ) ( y ) , + c(,y ) & = & ( ) ( y ) , + d(,y ) & = & ( ) ( y ) , + v(,y ) & = & e^(,y ) = ( ) ( y ) , .",
    "in fact @xmath80 are vorldvolume scale factors and @xmath81 is an orbifold scale factor .",
    "it appears that the suitable equations of motion are fully separable into the orbifold - dependent part and spacetime - dependent part provided @xcite n ( ) = 1 , ( ) = ( ) , where the first condition is simply the choice of the lapse function , while the second tells us that calabi - yau space is tracking the orbifold .",
    "one can show that orbifold - dependent part can be solved by & = & a_0 h^1/2(y ) , + & = & d_0 h^2(y ) , + & = & d_0 h^3(y ) , where h(y ) & = & _ 0 y + h_0 , + h(y ) & = & _ 0 , and we have applied y ",
    "= ( y ) - ( y - ) - 1 , so that y  = 2 ( y ) - 2 ( y - ) , ( factor 2 comes from the fact that @xmath82 is periodic ) and ( y ) = 1 if y 0 , + ( y ) = -1 if y < 0 .",
    "after all these substitutions one can write down 5-dimensional metric in the form [ ds5h ] ds_5 ^ 2 = -a_0 ^ 2 h(y ) d^2 + a_0 ^ 2 h(y ) + d_0 ^ 2 h^4(y ) ^2 ( ) dy^2 .",
    "elementary solutions of hoava - witten theory for friedmann flat geometry analogous to ( [ pbbsolns ] ) in pre - big - bang cosmology are given by taking one scale factor @xmath83 in ( [ ds5h ] ) and read [ hwsolns ] |a ( ) & = & ^p _ , p _",
    "= 3/11 4/11 , + ( ) & = & ^q _ , q _ = 2/11 4/11 , for the worldvolume and orbifold respectively . from ( [ hwsolns ] )",
    "one can easily deduce that there are four types of evolution of the worldvolume @xmath84 and the orbifold , namely : both worldvolume and orbifold contracts , both worldvolume and orbifold expand , worldvolume contracts while orbifold expands ( superinflationary ) and worldvolume expands while orbifold contracts .",
    "the former case corresponds to superinflation while the latter to standard radiation - dominated evolution in pre - big - bang scenario .",
    "using the relationship between _ weakly _ ( pre - big - bang ( [ com10 ] ) ) and _ strongly _ ( hoava - witten ( [ shwg ] ) ) coupled heterotic string theories @xcite we study the problem of the emergence of chaotic oscillations in mixmaster cosmologies based on these theories . in particular , we discuss kasner asymptotic states ( anisotropic solutions of zero curvature to the field equations ) of homogeneous bianchi type ix geometries in these string cosmologies . in order to present the time - dependent part of the hoava - witten field equations we use a new time coordinate @xcite @xmath85 from now on",
    "we will use the notation @xmath86 . to further simplify the equations we additionally define @xmath87 so that we get [ fe ] ( + + + ) _ , + _",
    ", ^2 = 2 ( _ , _ , + _ , _ , .",
    "+ _ , _ , ) + 2 ( _ , + _ , + _ , ) _ , , 2 _ , & = & ^2 , + 2 _ , & = & ^2 , + 2 _ , & = & ^2 , + _ , & = & 0 .",
    "the important point is that pre - big - bang field equations are the same except the constraint which now takes the form ( @xmath88 ) [ kasnerfe ] ( + + ) _ , - _ , ^2 = 2 ( _ , _ , + _ , _ , + _ , _ , ) + - 2 ( _ , + _ , + _ , ) _ , .",
    "the kasner asymptotic solutions are of the type @xmath89 where @xmath90 are scale factors , @xmath17 is the scalar field , @xmath91 constants and @xmath92 the so - called kasner indices ( it is obvious that the ` fourth ' kasner index @xmath93 refers to the scalar field ) .",
    "it is well - known that the approach to a singularity in bianchi type ix models of the universe happens through a sequence of the kasner - to - kasner transitions ( mixmaster oscillations ) .",
    "these transitions can be described as the replacements of the kasner indices of the type p_i = p_i(p_i ) .",
    "the main problem is to establish whether the number of these replacements will be finite ( no chaos ) or infinite ( chaos ) .",
    "it is easy to notice from the field equations ( [ fe ] ) that these transitions are possible only if the terms of the type [ increase ] ^4 ^ 2 ^(2p_1 + p_4 ) = ^(1 + p_1 - p_2 - p_3 ) , + ^4 ^ 2 ^(2p_2 + p_4 ) = ^(1 + p_2 - p_3 - p_1 ) , + ^4 ^ 2 ^(2p_3 + p_4 ) = ^(1 + p_3 - p_1 - p_2 ) , increase in the limit @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "the increase is possible in the regions which are marked in the figures 1 and 2 .",
    "1 corresponds to pre - big - bang while fig .",
    "2 corresponds to hoava - witten .",
    "however , this is not enough to answer the question about the infinite continuation of kasner transitions since the increase may , in general , be replaced by the decrease of these indices in the marked regions either .",
    "what is important is whether the increase ( or the decrease ) of the indices refers to all of them and whether they all may have the same sign .",
    "if they do have the same sign , the expansion becomes monotonic - a singularity is reached and there is no chaos .",
    "to establich that in both limits of the heterotic @xmath0 theory we obtain suitable conditions for kasner indices ( `` kasner sphere '' ) which are @xcite : @xmath96 for weak coupling limit ( pre - big - bang ) and @xcite @xmath97 for strong coupling limit . for further discussion it is important that both kasner asymptotics contain the isotropic solutions of friedmann type as special cases in their domains .",
    "for ( [ weak ] ) these points are defined by @xmath98 while for ( [ strong ] ) these points are defined by @xmath99 .",
    "this means there is a nonzero region in the parameter space where all indices can have the same sign ( e.g. all positive ) .",
    "once it happens the chaotic scatterings of the anisotropic bianchi ix model stop which means that it is impossible to approach singularity in a chaotic way .",
    "in fact , there is a relationships between the pre - big - bang ( [ weak ] ) and hoava - witten ( [ strong ] ) solutions and the result of our previous section is an example of generation of solutions from those known in one theory , into the other - in particular , into solutions of hoava - witten theory @xcite .",
    "this happens due to conformal relation between the theories : g_^e = e^- g_^s = e^ g_^hw , where @xmath100 refer to einstein frame , string frame and hoava - witten , respectively , and the relation is true , provided 3-branes are given by the separable ansatz equations ( [ separable ] ) .",
    "in particular , lots of exact solutions are available for the einstein frame ( general relativity + stiff fluid matter ) - having them , one is able to generate hoava - witten type solutions and study their properties .",
    "our conclusions are as follows .",
    "hoava - witten theory admits mixmaster type cosmology with kasner type asymptotic solutions . due to conformal relations one can generate hoava - witten cosmological solutions ( with separable 3-brane ) of many types and study their properties .",
    "hoava - witten mixmaster cosmology ( for truncated spectrum of particles ) , similarly as pre - big - bang ( truncated ) cosmology does not admit chaos .    finally , one should mention some open issues in the topic .",
    "firstly , one should study non - separable anstze for hoava - witten cosmology and investigate how they relate to pre - big - bang .",
    "secondly , one should study mixmaster behaviour of cosmological models which involve non - truncated spectrum of particles and inhomogeneities @xcite .",
