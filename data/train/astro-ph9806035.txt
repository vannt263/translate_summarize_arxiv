    "we need three kinds of ingredients to define a cosmological model : the background metric , the substance mix and the form of early departures from homogeneity .",
    "background metric features are set by the density parameter @xmath12 and the hubble parameter @xmath13km@xmath14s@xmath15mpc@xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the average density and @xmath17 ) ; the _ cosmic substance _ is fixed by partial density parameters , like @xmath18 for baryons , @xmath19 for cold  dark  matter ( cdm ) , or @xmath20 for vacuum ; finally , early deviations from homogeneity are described by the amplitude and the spectral index @xmath21 of the initial fluctuation spectrum .    however , while early spectral features essentially do not depend on background and substance parameters , the linear evolution of the spectrum does and this is usually expressed through transfer functions @xmath22@xmath23 ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the comoving length ",
    "scale ) , which give the ratio between the spectrum at a redshift @xmath4 and its initial value .    in this paper we shall restrict ourselves to spatially flat models , with no residual vacuum energy , and",
    "focus on the interplay between the nature of the cosmic substance ( yielding @xmath22 ) and primeval spectral features , performing a systematic analysis of the amount and nature of hot dark matter ( hdm ) , allowed by observational constraints , once we take the primeval spectral index ( see below ) in the range @xmath26 .    in this work",
    "we shall however consider only large scale structure ( lss ) features obtainable from linear theory , together with data on cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) anisotropies , which also refer to an epoch when fluctuations were still linear .",
    "the cbr temperature is almost direction independent and , once the dipole term ( which accounts for the motion of earth in respect to cbr ) is subtracted , its fluctuations @xmath27@xmath28 .",
    "since we expect that deviations from a gaussian behaviour are substantially absent at these stages , anisotropy features are suitably expressed through the quantities @xmath29 , for @xmath30 .",
    "as we shall see , cbr and lss linear constraints already cause a severe selection among models and models to be used in numerical simulations should be submitted first to _ linear _ tests .",
    "let us now consider recent data on cbr anisotropies . as usual",
    ", we shall assume that the primeval spectrum reads @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is the distance from the recombination band , as @xmath33 is the present horizon radius ) .",
    "it is then known ( see , @xmath34 , ma @xmath35 bertschinger 1996 ) that @xmath36 with @xmath37    \\eqno ( 1.3)\\ ] ] ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) . in this general expression ,",
    "the source function @xmath38 contains contributions originating both at the last scattering band and along the path from it to us . for @xmath39 and low @xmath40 ( large scales @xmath25 ) , the most relevant effect is sachs  wolfe , and the simple form @xmath41 can be used , which does not depend on the substance characteristics , but only on @xmath21 .",
    "although this approximation holds for rather small @xmath40 only , in most cases the nature of the substance does not drastically affect the @xmath40 dependence of @xmath42 up to the so  called doppler peak ( @xmath43 ) ( dodelson et al .",
    "1996 ) .    using eq .",
    "( 1.4 ) and measuring @xmath42 up to @xmath44 , the cobe collaboration ( bennet et al .",
    "1996 ) could estimate the spectral index and found @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , cobe data already favour @xmath46 , although they are fully compatible with @xmath0 .",
    "more recent measurement ( netterfield et al . , 1997 ) , extending up to @xmath47 ( corresponding to angles @xmath48 ) , explored the doppler peak .",
    "the detected values seem to exclude models with low @xmath49 values ( hancock et al .",
    "1998 ) , and agree with cdm and @xmath39 only for @xmath50 ( lineweaver 1997 , lineweaver @xmath35 barbosa 1998 ) .",
    "an alternative possibility to fit such data is that @xmath51 .",
    "although these results obviously need further confirm , they seem to tell us that inflation generated a spectrum @xmath52 with @xmath51 .",
    "there are two main reasons why this is seen as a problem by some cosmologists . in the first place ,",
    "the generic prediction of inflation is that @xmath53 .",
    "section 4 will be devoted to a brief discussion on a class of inflationary theories which however predict @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , cdm fit with lss improves for @xmath54 .",
    "another way to improve the fit of models with lss consists into assuming that dm has also a hot component .",
    "the basic philosophy of mixed dark matter ( mdm ) models , since the first computation of their transfer function ( bonometto @xmath35 valdarnini , 1984 ; see also achilli et al . 1985 ;",
    "valdarnini @xmath35 bonometto 1985 ) , is that the unexplored non  interacting world ( gravitation apart ) can be quite complicated and probably contains several particle components . if one of them becomes non ",
    "relativistic when the scale @xmath55 enters the horizon , then @xmath56 is damped over all scales @xmath57 .",
    "the detailed expression of @xmath56 depends on the dm mix and the effect can not be neglected if such component gives a substantial contribution to the overall density and @xmath55 exceeds galaxy scales .",
    "an attempt was also performed to consider @xmath1 in association to mixed dm ( lucchin et al .",
    "1996 ) , trying to balance opposite departures from standard cdm .",
    "however , the mix studied by these authors produces too many clusters , as was outlined by borgani et al .",
    "liddle et al . ( 1996 ) considered models with @xmath51 , in association with high @xmath2 and possibly low @xmath58 values , but they saw the same problems outlined by borgani et al ( 1996 ) and did not indicate an area of fit with data . if it is confirmed that @xmath1 , however , there seems to be no alternative to try to follow such pattern . owing to that , we tested a wide range of dm mixtures in association with values of @xmath21 between 1 and 1.4 .",
    "we found that the above difficulties can be overcame for a wide set of such models .",
    "our analysis was restricted to the _ linear _ constraints described in sec .  3 and to models with @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "models were parametrized by @xmath2 ( the density parameter of the non  cold component ) and @xmath63 ; here we defined @xmath64 ; this would be the redshift when the photon density reaches the baryon+dm density , if all dm is cdm and @xmath65 .",
    "the derelativization redshift @xmath66 , instead , occurs when the average particle momentum @xmath67 ( particle mass ) .",
    "a particle model allowing a continuous selection of @xmath68 $ ] pairs is obtained if heavier particles ( @xmath69 ) decay into lighter massive particles ( @xmath70 ) , whose phase  space distribution turns out to be quite different from _ usual _ massive @xmath71 s .",
    "particle models leading to such hot dm component were discussed in several papers ( @xmath34 , bonometto , gabbiani @xmath35 masiero 1994 , ghizzardi @xmath35 bonometto 1996 ) and the evolution of density fluctuations in such context was discussed by pierpaoli @xmath35 bonometto ( 1995 ) and pierpaoli et al . ( 1996 ) .",
    "hereafter we shall distinguish these models from models with phase ",
    "space particle distribution of thermal origin , calling _ volatile _ their non  cold component",
    ". however we shall show that also a large deal of models based on massive @xmath71 s are consistent with linear constraints .",
    "owing to the peculiar phase  space distribution of volatile dm and to the actual energy dependence of fluctuation amplitudes in such models , public algorithms can not be used to evaluate @xmath56 . here",
    "we shall make use of a flexible algorithm that we developed also to this aim .",
    "a discussion of phase ",
    "space distributions , fluctuation evolution and constraints arising from particle kinematics is given in sec .  2 and in appendix a. more details on the algorithm",
    "are given in appendix b. as already mentioned , sections 3 and 4 deal with _ linear _ lss constraints and inflationary theories yielding @xmath1 , respectively . section 5 will be devoted to the analysis of results concerning acceptable models .",
    "we provide some plots showing the allowed area in the parameter plane and some sample transferred spectra .",
    "furthermore , for parameter choices consistent with hot dm ( @xmath34 massive neutrinos ) , we compare the transferred spectra , finding small ( expected ) discrepancies between volatile models and those with massive @xmath71 s .",
    "section 6 is devoted to a final discussion and to conclusions .",
    "the _ substance _ of mixed models is made of various components , which can be classified according to their behaviour at the time when galactic mass  scales enter the horizon .",
    "particles which become non  relativistic before then , are said _",
    "cold_. there can be one or more of such components , indistinguishable through astrophysical measures .",

    "using the distribution ( 2.1 ) we can evaluate @xmath85 accordingly , @xmath86 when @xmath87 and , for massive @xmath71 s , @xmath88 while @xmath89    hot components can also originate in the decay of a heavy particle @xmath69 .",
    "let @xmath90 be the comoving number density of @xmath69 s at their decoupling , taking place at some early time @xmath91 , well after they became non ",
    "relativistic , and let @xmath92 be their mass . at @xmath93",
    "their comoving number density reads : @xmath94 \\eqno ( 2.5)\\ ] ] with @xmath95 ( decay time ) .",
    "we shall assume a two  body decay process , as is more likely for dynamical reasons : @xmath96 the decay gives rise to a light ( _ volatile _ ) particle @xmath70 , of mass @xmath97 , and to a massless particle @xmath98 .",
    "it can be either a photon ( @xmath99 ) or a sterile scalar , as is expected to exist in theories where a global invariance is broken below a suitable energy scale ( examples of such particles are _ familons _ and _ majorons _ ) .",
    "we shall show that the latter case ( sterile scalar ) is potentially more significant .",
    "using the distribution ( 2.7 ) , it is easy to see that the average @xmath108 according to eq .",
    "@xmath70 s will therefore become non relativistic when @xmath109 ; henceforth @xmath110 ( let us recall that we defined @xmath111 ) .",
    "( 2.10 ) can be conveniently used in the distribution ( 2.7 ) , instead of eq .",
    "( 2.7a ) , as involves model parameters ( @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) , instead of early particle features ( @xmath92 and @xmath114 ) , which should be further elaborated in order to work out @xmath115 .",
    "let us now discuss the decay patterns in more detail .",
    "first of all , if @xmath116 , the decay should occur at a redshift @xmath117 , so to avoid distorsions of cbr spectrum ( see , @xmath34 burigana et al . , 1991 ) .",
    "two further possibilities should then be considered .",
    "if the decay takes place before big  bang nucleosynthesis ( bbns ) , the energy density of @xmath70 s is limited by the requirement that bbns yields are consistent with observed nuclide abundances ; henceforth the number of relativistic spin states @xmath118 ( see , @xmath34 olive et al .",
    "therefore , the actual limit on the energy density of @xmath70 s depends on the number of relativistic @xmath71 s at bbns",
    ". if some @xmath71 has a mass exceeding @xmath119mev ( particle data surely allow it for @xmath120 ) and decays before decoupling , @xmath70 s can _ occupy _ its place during bbns . as far as cosmology is concerned ,",
    "differences between such volatile dm and ordinary hot dm would arise from the following 3 kinematic reasons : ( i ) the different phase  space distribution of @xmath70 s in respect to massive @xmath71 s ; ( ii ) the different energy dependence of fluctuation amplitudes ; ( iii ) the allowed continuous range of hdm derelativization redshift ; in the neutrino case , for a given hdm density , the derelativization redshifts are `` quantized '' by the discreteness of @xmath103 .    by evaluating the transfer function for volatile models , we shall see that the points ( i ) and ( ii ) have a modest impact ( see table i in sec .",
    "consequences of ( iii ) would be important only if other cosmological parameters , like @xmath121 and @xmath58 , were very well known . altogether , therefore , the main differences induced by the above 3 points concern particle aspects .",
    "for example , @xmath70 s number density can be significantly smaller than @xmath71 s and their masses can be much greater . in spite of that",
    ", their density and derelativization redshift @xmath66 can be equal and lss effects are quite similar .",
    "let then still be @xmath116 , but let us assume that the decay occurs after bbns ; also in this case , there are constraints related to bbns . in fact , decays produce an equal amount of @xmath70 s and @xmath99 s .",
    "the present cbr temperature normalizes @xmath99 abundance _ after _ the thermalization of decay photons .",
    "accordingly , a large @xmath70 density implies a small @xmath99 and massless @xmath71 density _ before _ the decay .",
    "bbns would therefore take place almost at the _ usual _ temperature , but earlier in time .",
    "neutron decay would be therefore allowed a smaller time to work and neutron abundance , at the opening of the so  called _ deuterium bottleneck _ , would be greater . from this qualitative framework",
    "quantitative limits to the final @xmath70 abundance allowed by bbns can be derived .",
    "we shall not further detail this point here and will only consider a softer limit , ensuing from the obvious requirement that the final @xmath70 density shall be smaller than @xmath99 density , as the latter one has a `` contribution '' from `` primeval '' @xmath99 s .",
    "as is shown in appendix a , for a model with given @xmath2 and @xmath113 , at redshifts @xmath122 , the following relation holds : @xmath123 henceforth , in this case , it must be @xmath124 therefore , according to eq.(2.8 ) , this case never implies primeval temporary matter  dominated expansion , at @xmath125 .",
    "it should be also outlined that these models can have quite a low massless neutrino density , as @xmath69 decay increases @xmath126 temperature , but does not act on @xmath71 background . in appendix",
    "a we show that @xmath127 and a relevant variation of the massless sterile component ( smlc hereafter ) can have a significant impact on @xmath22 .    on the contrary , if @xmath98 s are sterile scalars and the decay takes place well after bbns , constraints are not so stringent .",
    "@xmath98 s will behave just as massless @xmath71 s and these models can be characterized by a high smlc density , which can also have a major impact in shaping the present lss .",
    "therefore , significant constraints on the models can arise from this effect , which , however , can not be discriminated _",
    "a priori_. let us recall that , in the absence of @xmath69 decay , the ratio @xmath128 .",
    "@xmath69 decay modifies it , turning @xmath103 into an effective value @xmath129 ( see appendix a ) . in this case , no matter dominance occurs before @xmath114 if @xmath130 and @xmath98 s contribution to the relativistic component lowers the _ equivalence _ redshift .",
    "when when @xmath131 , also @xmath70 s are still relativistic at equivalence .",
    "accordingly , the equivalence occurs at either @xmath132 in the former and latter case , respectively .",
    "mixed models involving a large volatile fraction , with late derelativization , are therefore allowed only within this scenario . in what follows",
    "we shall systematically analyze a large deal of mixed models , also with large @xmath2 and @xmath113 , consistent with this last picture , but we shall find that viable models with @xmath133 are not so frequent .",
    "model parameters can be constrained from particle physics and/or from lss . in this work",
    "we analyze a number of the latter constraints , which can be tested without discussing non  linear evolution .",
    "more in detail , we shall consider the following prescriptions : ( i ) we set the numerical constant @xmath134 , in the spectrum ( 1.1 ) , so that @xmath135 is consistent with cobe 3@xmath136 intervals for @xmath137 ( for different @xmath21 s ) .",
    "\\(ii ) once the normalization is fixed at small @xmath138 , we test the large @xmath138 behaviour , first of all on the @xmath139mpc scale .",
    "the mass @xmath140 , within a sphere of radius @xmath141 , is @xmath142 therefore , the cumulative cluster density @xmath143 \\exp(-u^2/2 ) \\eqno ( 3.2)\\ ] ] for @xmath144m@xmath145 is directly related to the value of @xmath146 . in eq .",
    "( 3.2 ) we take @xmath147 defined so that the mass variance ( evaluated with a top  hat window function ) @xmath148 ; @xmath149 values from 1.69 ( peebles , 1980 ) to 1.55 were taken in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "let us then consider @xmath150 for the above @xmath151 value .",
    "optical and x  ray observations give a value of @xmath152 which is still not so different from @xmath153 , as found by white at al .",
    "( 1993 ) and biviano et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . both the observational value and its theoretical prediction are however subject to a number of uncertainties .",
    "for instance , observations have some problems to fix cluster masses ( see also below ) . from the theoretical side ,",
    "non  linearity effects and mechanism turning fluctuations into clusters can not be said to be completely under control .",
    "it is also wise recalling that @xmath152 and @xmath146 feel the slope of the spectrum , around @xmath154mpc , in a slightly different way . henceforth , we shall further comment on @xmath146 values , after discussing the spectral slope .",
    "the above arguments tell us that , in our systematic search , it is wise to keep models with @xmath155 .",
    "\\(iii ) models can survive the previous test for the whole range of @xmath134 or for a part of it .",
    "allowed @xmath156 values were then used to evaluate the expected density parameters @xmath157 in damped lyman @xmath158 systems ( for a review see wolfe , 1993 ) . here",
    "@xmath159 , \\eqno ( 3.3)\\ ] ] where @xmath160 is the ( top hat ) mass variance ( for mass @xmath151 at redshift @xmath4 ) and @xmath158 is an efficiency parameter which should be @xmath161 .",
    "more specifically , using such expression , we evaluated @xmath162 , taking @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "this choice of values , as well as the choice of a _ top  hat _ window function , is a compromise among various suggestions in the literature , supported by different arguments .",
    "e.g. , values of @xmath149 greater than 1.7 ( ma @xmath35 bertschinger 1994 ) or as small as 1.3 ( klypin et al .",
    "1995 ) were discussed , a value of @xmath151 ten times greater was often considered and the quantitative relevance of changing the window function was debated ( see , e.g. , borgani et al . , 1996 and pierpaoli et al . , 1996 ) . according to storrie ",
    "lombardi et al . (",
    "1995 ) , observations give @xmath166 .",
    "therefore , we passed models only when @xmath167 .",
    "it must be outlined that varying this limit by a factor @xmath168 would cause only marginal changes for models accepted .",
    "slight shifts of @xmath2 or @xmath113 usually cause significant variation of @xmath169 and this constraint turns out to be a fairly substantial one .",
    "other tests concerning objects at large @xmath4 , like early galaxies and qso s , are less restrictive .",
    "\\(iv ) bulk velocities were also evaluated and compared with potent reconstructions of velocity fields .",
    "here we shall report no detail on the procedure , which causes no constraint , at the 2@xmath136 level .    on the contrary",
    ", a severe further selection arises from requiring that : ( v ) the _ extra  power _",
    "parameter @xmath170 ( here @xmath171 are mass variances on the scales @xmath172mpc ) has values consistent with observations . from apm galaxies ,",
    "peacock and dodds ( 1994 ) obtained @xmath173 . in a more recent work , borgani et al .",
    "( 1997 ) give the interval 0.180.25 obtained from the abell / aco sample .",
    "however , owing to the high value ( 10/3 ) of the exponent , a shift of @xmath174 by a small factor induces a major @xmath3 displacement .",
    "for example , if non  linear effects are under  evaluated by just @xmath175 , @xmath3 encreases by @xmath176 .",
    "this effect is more likely for low @xmath3 values , which can be due to fairly high @xmath146 values .",
    "henceforth we kept 0.27 as top acceptable value , which is both the upper limit given for apm and the @xmath177 upper limit for abell / aco . on the contrary we took 0.13 as lower limit , assuming that an underestimate of non  linear effects by @xmath1788@xmath179 can not be excluded .",
    "as already mentioned , the constraint on @xmath3 , together with a suitable constraint on @xmath146 , implies a constraint on @xmath152 .",
    "checks of @xmath146 , @xmath152 and @xmath3 are , therefore , strictly related .    for instance , an observational value for @xmath146 can be deduced from x  ray data on the gas temperature @xmath180 in galaxy clusters . if clusters are substantially virialized and the intracluster gas is isothermal , the mass @xmath151 of a cluster can be obtained , once the ratio @xmath181 is known ; then , the temperature function can be converted into a mass function , which can be fit to a press @xmath35 schechter expression ( see eq .",

    "some of the transferred spectra we obtain will be plotted , together with spectral data obtained from las campanas survey ( lcrs ) , kindly provided by lin et al .",

    "( 1996 ) , but not treated in this article .",
    "the basic issue following this discussion , which can be suitably rephrased for other data sets , is that it is non  trivial to extract discriminatory criteria from observational spectra .",
    "most of such criteria are expressed by quantities already introduced earlier in this section .",
    "furthermore , quite in general , in a systematic search , predictions are to be fit with fairly wide observational intervals .",
    "in fact , a marginal agreement with the data , for a model met in a systematic analysis , can be often improved by a suitable finer tuning of parameters .",
    "we verified that , in several cases , this was the actual situation .",
    "this section is a quick review of results in the literature , aiming to show that there is a wide class of inflationary models which predict @xmath51 , but @xmath214 .",
    "it can be therefore skipped by those who are aware of such results .",
    "density perturbations arise during inflation because of quantum fluctuations of the _ inflaton _ field @xmath215 .",
    "their amplitude and power spectrum are related to the hubble parameter @xmath216 during inflation and to the speed @xmath217 of the _ slow  rolling  down _ process , along the scalar field potential .",
    "it can be shown that the critical quantity is the ratio @xmath218 , where @xmath216 and @xmath217 are taken at the time when the scale @xmath219 leaves the event horizon .",
    "the value of the spectral index can then be shown to be @xmath220 and , if @xmath221 ( slowly ) decreases with time , we have the standard case of @xmath21 ( slightly ) below unity ( it should be reminded that greater scales flow out of the horizon at earlier times ) .",
    "this decrease is due to an acceleration of the downhill motion of @xmath215 and an opposite behaviour occurs if @xmath217 decreases while approaching a minimum .",
    "the basic reason why a potential yielding such a behaviour seems unappealing , is that the very last stages of inflation should rather see a significant @xmath215field acceleration , ending up into a regime of damped oscillations around the true vacuum , when reheating occurs .",
    "these objections can be overcame if the usual perspective is reversed : reheating does not arise when an initially smooth acceleration finally grows faster and faster , as the slope of the potential steepens ; on the contrary , reheating starts abruptly , thanks to a first order phase transition , perhaps to be identified with the break of the gut symmetry . before such transition and since the planck time , most energy content naturally resided in potential terms , so granting a vacuum  dominated expansion .",
    "this picture of the early stage of the cosmic expansion is the so  called _",
    "hybrid inflation _ , initially proposed by linde ( 1991a ) .    a toy  model realizing such scenario ( linde 1991b , 1994 ) is obtained from the potential @xmath222 depending on the two scalar fields @xmath215 and @xmath223 , expected to be slowly and fastly evolving , respectively .",
    "if the slowly evolving field is embedded in mass terms , the potential reads @xmath224 where @xmath225 eq .",
    "( 4.3 ) shows that @xmath226 has a minimum at @xmath227 , provided that @xmath228 . if @xmath229 , instead , the minimum is for @xmath230@xmath231 , yielding @xmath232 when @xmath233 .",
    "large @xmath215 values therefore require that @xmath223 vanishes and then the potential @xmath234 allows a planck ",
    "time inflation , as @xmath215 rolls downhill taking @xmath226 from an initial value @xmath235 to @xmath236 .",
    "this downhill motion is expected to decelerate when the second term at the @xmath237 of eq .",
    "( 4.5 ) becomes negligible in respect to @xmath238 , which essentially acts as a cosmological constant .",
    "this deceleration abruptly breaks down when the critical value @xmath239 is attained , for which @xmath240 changes sign . at that point",
    "the configuration @xmath241 is unstable and the transition to the true vacuum configuration @xmath230 reheats ( or heats ) the universe .",
    "there are a number of constraints to the above picture , due to the requirements that at least 60 e  foldings occur with @xmath242 and that fluctuations have a fair amplitude .",
    "such constraints are discussed in several papers ( see , @xmath34 , copeland et al . 1994 , and references therein ) and cause the restriction @xmath243 .",
    "henceforth , in this work we shall debate models with @xmath244 .",
    "let us however outline that _ hybrid _ inflation is not just one of the many possible variations on the inflationary theme .",
    "in spite of the apparent complication of the above scheme , it is an intrinsically simple picture and one of the few patterns which can allow to recover a joint particle ",
    "astrophysical picture of the very early universe , as was naturally hoped before it became clear that the higgs field of the gut transition could not be the inflaton ( see , @xmath34 , shafi @xmath35 vilenkin , 1984 and pi , 1984 ) .",

    "we sped it up by truncating the hierarchical set of equations of free  streaming particles ( photons after recombination , hdm and massless @xmath71 s ) , according to the scheme suggested by ma @xmath35 bertschinger ( 1996 ) , slightly modifying it because we do nt use conformal time .",
    "results with truncation were compared with results with a free number of harmonics and we found that a truncation at the 8th harmonics is mostly sufficient .",

    "relative discrepancies between code outputs vary from less than @xmath402 , on scales above @xmath403mpc , to slightly above 3@xmath179 in the worst cases , which occur for the hot component , when @xmath404 and for scales below 23@xmath14mpc . in such cases cmbfast",
    "tends to give a transfer function slightly smaller than our code .",
    "the typical discrepancy , however , keeps safely below @xmath405 and , therefore , we fully confirm the validity of cmbfast .",
    "altogether the main source of error comes from the analytic fit to the transfer functions , although the top discrepancy at a single point keeps @xmath406 in the worst cases and its typical value is @xmath407 ."
