    "bouncing cosmological models @xcite are being widely investigated because , besides solving the singularity problem in cosmology by construction , they can also solve the horizon and flatness puzzles , and lead to an almost scale invariant spectrum of scalar perturbations if the contracting phase is dominated by dust at large scales @xcite .",
    "one of the calculations that have been done was the evaluation of the spectral index of long wavelength tensor perturbations , @xmath0 , and in most of bouncing models they were found to be also scale invariant . with respect to their amplitudes , specific models must be worked out . for instance , in the cyclic ekpyrotic scenario , they were evaluated and it was shown that the amplitudes are too small to be detected by present gravitational wave detectors @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will calculate the spectrum and amplitude of relic gravitons in a different bouncing cosmological model .",
    "it consists of a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe filled by dust and radiation , which is contracting classically .",
    "as it approaches the singularity , quantum cosmological effects on the background , here described through the wheeler - dewitt equation interpreted along the lines of the bohm - de broglie quantum theory , avoids the singularity and ejects the universe to the expanding phase we are now experiencing .",
    "note that our bouncing model is very conservative : there is nothing else than dust and radiation , we are working with a @xmath1 dimensional space - time , and we are performing a canonical quantization of the second order perturbed ( with respect to the flrw background ) einstein - hilbert action of general relativity , interpreted along the lines of a quantum theory appropriate to quantum cosmology , namely , one which does not need any external agent to the quantum system to give a meaning to the quantum calculations .",
    "evolution of quantum perturbations ( scalar , vector and tensor ) on these quantum backgrounds can be described by simple equations , as it was demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite . with these equations",
    ", we were able to calculate the spectrum ( analytically and numerically ) and amplitude ( numerically ) of this stochastic background of relic gravitons .",
    "although , the spectrum and amplitude differ considerably from the cyclic ekpyrotic scenario , the main conclusion remains the same , namely , that the amplitudes are too small to be detected by any present and near future gravitational wave detectors .",
    "the paper is divided as follows : in the next section we review the main aspects of the quantum cosmological bouncing model on which the relic gravitons evolves , and we obtain the dynamical equations that the tensor perturbations which describe these relic gravitons must obey . in section",
    "iii we derive the expression for the critical fraction of the relic gravitons energy density from the tensor perturbations described in section ii . in section",
    "iv we calculate the spectrum and amplitude of this energy density and the graviton strain either analytically ( for the spectrum ) and numerically .",

    "we start with an einstein - hilbert action coupled to a perfect fluid described by the schutz formalism @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the planck length in natural units ( @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 is the perfect fluid pressure whose density @xmath6 is given by the equation of state @xmath7 , with @xmath8 .",
    "writing down the action of a fluid as proportional to the pressure has also been proposed by other authors @xcite .",
    "all these approaches are generally covariant , but they yield a preferred time direction , the one connected with the surfaces of constant potential of the velocity field of the fluid .",
    "such very simple fluids can also be completely characterized by the k - essence lagrangian @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a scalar field and @xmath11 is a constant .",
    "this scalar field has equation of state @xmath12 .",
    "it has no potential and a non - trivial kinetic term .",
    "the matter hamiltonian which we will exhibit below can be easily obtained from this lagrangian after one performs a simple canonical transformation .",
    "this fluid description is suitable to describe the primordial universe , when radiation dominates and all particles become relativistic , if we make the choice @xmath13 . in what folows",
    ", we will directly quantize this perfect fluid lagrangian .",
    "this can be justified in physical grounds because it was implementes while studying superfluids @xcite , and the quantum model based on this procedure turned out to be quite accurate in describing many properties of such physical systems .",

    "the fact that the momentum @xmath31 appears linearly in the hamiltonian suggests to consider its canonical position @xmath32 as a time variable .",
    "indeed , from the canonical transformation used to arrive at this expression @xcite , one has that @xmath33 , ( @xmath34 ) that is , it is just the potential of the fluid velocity , which characterizes a prefered foliation of spacetime .",

    ", this hamiltonian can be substantially simplified through the implementation of the quantum canonical transformation generated by @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the self - adjoint operators associated with the corresponding classical variables , yielding , for a particular factor ordering of  ( [ h1 ] ) ( see section 3 in ref .",

    "<S> the spectrum and amplitude of the stochastic background of relic gravitons produced in a bouncing universe is calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the matter content of the model consists of dust and radiation fluids , and the bounce occurs due to quantum cosmological effects when the universe approaches the classical singularity in the contracting phase . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting amplitude is very small and it can not be observed by any present and near future gravitational wave detector . </S>",
    "<S> hence , as in the ekpyrotic model , any observation of these relic gravitons will rule out this type of quantum cosmological bouncing model . </S>"
