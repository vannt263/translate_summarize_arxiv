    "recent experimental results from the k2k collaboration show a significant deficit of muons in the forward scattering events with respect to the simulations , which could limit the accuracy of the predicted neutrino energy spectrum at the far detector  @xcite .",
    "this deficit could be due , among other possibilities , to the overestimation of charged current ( cc ) coherent pion production .",
    "a later search  @xcite found no evidence of cc coherent pion production in @xmath0c and obtained an upper limit for the fraction of this process to the total cc interaction well below some estimations based on the rein and sehgal model of ref .",
    "preliminary miniboone results for neutral current @xmath1 production show a similar deficit @xcite in the forward direction when compared with different montecarlo ( mc ) models : nuance  @xcite , neugen  @xcite and neut  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancies between these mc simulations indicate the considerable uncertainties in the theoretical description of coherent pion production .",
    "in addition , miniboone has collected a large set of data for @xmath2 production in @xmath0c induced by muon neutrinos of energies around 0.7  gev  @xcite .",
    "a fraction of these pions is created coherently , so that a realistic description of the coherent process is required to analyze and understand these data .",
    "cc coherent pion production has been observed experimentally at higher energies and for several nuclei @xcite .",
    "these experiments were studied theoretically using models based on pcac @xcite which described well the results .",
    "work along the same lines has been carried out at low energies in ref .",
    "the only nuclear medium effect considered in these calculations is the distortion of the final pion .",
    "other approaches have tried to incorporate some additional nuclear medium effects that modify the weak pion production . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors used the impulse approximation with undistorted pion waves , but already modified the @xmath3 resonance properties , and therefore the production mechanisms , using an effective @xmath3 mass .",
    "the importance of these nuclear effects was demonstrated there by comparing the results with those obtained using a free @xmath3 .",
    "kelkar et al .",
    "@xcite developed a more sophisticated treatment of the @xmath3 in the nuclear medium , and also included the final pion distortion by solving the klein gordon ( kg ) equation with a pion nucleus optical potential .",
    "this model predicted a very low cross section , compatible with the recent results of ref .",
    "nonetheless , there were several approximations in this work .",
    "on the one side a non relativistic reduction of the hadronic current was done , on the other side all the transverse parts of the amplitude were neglected . whereas these approximations are quite reasonable to get an estimate of the cross section for this process , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a more complete calculation is required now that new data are becoming available .",
    "more recently , singh et al .",
    "@xcite used similar medium effects on the production mechanisms and improved on the description of the elementary @xmath4 process by using a fully relativistic calculation of this process and including all pieces of the amplitude .",
    "however , the pion distortion was implemented in the eikonal approximation , which is not very reliable for the low energy pions that apparently dominate this reaction .",
    "our aim in this paper is to improve the model of kelkar et al .",

    "in the cc coherent pion production induced by neutrinos ( @xmath5 ) , the nucleus remains in its ground state .",
    "the process consists of a weak pion production followed by the strong distortion of the pion in its way out of the nucleus .",
    "first , we must consider the elementary process of @xmath2 production ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "there are large experimental uncertainties in this cross section at the low energies relevant to this work , which can be clearly appreciated by comparing , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "these discrepancies are ultimately translated into different values for the @xmath3 resonance axial form factors that appear in the theoretical models , and are a source of uncertainty for the calculation of the pion production cross sections . in any case , it seems to be clear that for neutrino energies below 2 gev , this process is dominated by a @xmath7 excitation , @xmath8 or @xmath9 followed by its decay  @xcite , and therefore it is larger for protons than for neutrons as discussed below .",
    "the situation is different for @xmath1 production or at higher energies . in that case , the @xmath3 mechanism is not enough to provide a good description of data  @xcite .",
    "after the introduction of the elementary model for the reaction we discuss how it is modified in the nuclear medium , due to the density dependent changes of the @xmath3 resonance peak s position and width .",
    "finally , we study the distortion of the pion wave function using a pion nucleus optical potential .",
    "the matrix element for the elementary process @xmath10 is written as    @xmath11    with the leptonic current    @xmath12    and the hadronic current @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the nucleon mass , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the rarita schwinger and dirac spinors for the @xmath3 and the nucleon of momentum @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the momentum transfer , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) are the vector and axial vector transition form factors .",

    "the approximation is based on the fact that , for gaussian nuclear wave functions , it leads to an exact treatment of the terms linear in momentum of the elementary amplitude and allows for a consistent description of the pion - nucleon and pion - nucleus kinematics  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , where a very similar potential was considered , using as here the local density approximation and the same values for the @xmath3 selfenergy .",
    "the main differences with that work are their inclusion of a phenomenological s - wave selfenergy , and our inclusion of the @xmath3 crossed term .",

    "the modification of the elementary reaction mechanism , through the inclusion of the @xmath3 selfenergy in the propagator , already produces a strong reduction of the cross section .",
    "this reduction of around 35% agrees with the results of ref .",
    "the pion distortion further decreases the cross section and moves the peak to lower energies .",
    "this reflects the presence of a strongly absorptive part in the optical potential around the @xmath3 resonance peak .",

    "our eikonal result differs from the one obtained in ref .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we present the same observable averaged over the k2k  @xcite and the miniboone @xcite spectra compared with the results for a fixed neutrino energy .",
    "the consideration of high energy neutrinos widens the pion momentum distribution , due to phase space . even when both spectra are quite different and k2k has a larger average neutrino energy ( 1.3  gev ) than miniboone ( 0.75  gev ) , the peak position stays at the same pion momentum , below the @xmath3 resonance .",
    "furthermore , most of the pions have relatively low energies such that the use of the @xmath3-hole model is appropriate .",
    "although the total cross section and the energy distribution are strongly modified by the nuclear medium , the angular distribution of the muons remains relatively unaffected , as can be seen on the left panel of fig .",

    "gev and averages over k2k and miniboone fluxes.,scaledwidth=99.0% ]    in both cases , the consideration of higher energy neutrinos leads to a narrower angular distribution . as a consequence ,",
    "the miniboone angular distribution is appreciably more forward peaked than the one at 1  gev even when its average energy is lower .",
    "we have also checked that the lower bound on the muon energy used by k2k in ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath125  mev / c ) does not modify appreciably this observable .",
    "we show the total cross section as a function of the neutrino energy and for several nuclei in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , with the caveat that the pion production model is less satisfactory at high energies .",
    "one reason is that mechanisms , other than the excitation of the @xmath3 resonance , become relevant .",
    "also the pion distortion , based on the @xmath3-hole model , is not appropriate for the high energy pions that can be produced by neutrinos with @xmath126  gev .",
    "nonetheless , the @xmath86 interaction is much weaker at high energies than at the @xmath3 peak and thus distortion effects should be smaller there .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , we present the dependence of the total cross section on the atomic number .",
    "gev as a function of the effective number of participants p = z+n/3 , as explained in the text.,scaledwidth=82.0% ]    in this process , the amplitude is the coherent sum of the contributions of all participant nucleons . taking into account the isospin factors",
    ", this implies that the amplitude is proportional to an effective number of participants defined as p = z+n/3 ; here z and n are the number of protons and neutrons respectively .",
    "this could suggest a quadratic dependence of the cross section on p , so that for heavier nuclei , the process could be comparatively larger with respect to incoherent @xmath127 production or other processes .",
    "however , there are several reasons that quench the p dependence .",
    "first , pion absorption is quite strong and forces the reaction to be peripheral .",
    "notice that the cross sections for the inclusive processes are not affected by this .",
    "second , the nuclear form factor is narrower for heavy nuclei , and reduces more the contribution from high momentum transfers .",
    "our result for the integrated cross section for coherent pion production on @xmath0c averaged over the k2k flux is @xmath128  cm@xmath40 .",
    "this value is above the upper limit of @xmath130  cm@xmath40 obtained using the ratio between coherent and @xmath131 , the total cc cross section , from the k2k collaboration  @xcite and the value for @xmath131 of their mc calculation . without the experimental threshold for the muon momentum , @xmath132 mev@xmath133 , we obtain @xmath134  cm@xmath40 .",
    "excitation and coherent @xmath2 production.,scaledwidth=82.0% ]    there are several factors that might conspire to produce the disagreement between our calculation and the experimental upper bound .",
    "first of all , due to the considerable uncertainty in the experimental data for pion production cross sections on the nucleon , the axial n-@xmath3 form factors are not sufficiently constrained .",
    "a more complete theoretical description of the elementary amplitude with the inclusion of background terms  @xcite and heavier resonances  @xcite could help , but in order to put such a model on a firm ground , more precise data are required .",
    "the optical potential employed in our calculation is realistic around the @xmath3 peak ( i.e. for pions with 150 - 450  mev / c momenta ) , where most of the strength of the reaction actually concentrates , but has room for improvement both at lower and higher energies .",
    "it is also important to recall that at forward angles , where the coherent process is sizable , nuclear effects play an important role and this may affect the experimental separation of the coherent events from the incoherent ones which , to a large extent , relies on the theoretical models built in the mc simulations . the situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] where we plot the muon angular distributions averaged over the k2k flux ( and with @xmath135  mev / c ) for coherent @xmath2 production , together with the main contributions to the total inclusive cc cross section : quasielastic scattering ( qe ) and incoherent @xmath3 excitation . the calculations of the @xmath3 part is performed with the same elementary amplitudes and in - medium effects as given above for the coherent reaction . for the quasielastic process , we have adopted the model of ref .",
    "@xcite but updating the nucleon form factors according to  @xcite .",
    "nuclear effects include fermi motion , pauli blocking with a local fermi gas and the renormalization of the weak transition , which is treated as an rpa resummation of particle - hole and @xmath3-hole states .",

    "[ fig : fig6 ] , while they are negligible for @xmath137 . therefore , if a model that lacks these correlations is used to extrapolate the data from the region of @xmath138 to forward angles , one might overestimate the qe part , causing an underestimation of the contribution of other mechanisms , like the coherent pion production , to the cross section .",
    "we have studied cc coherent pion production induced by muon neutrinos @xmath139 .",
    "our model takes into account the modification of the production mechanism due to the renormalization of the @xmath3 properties in the nuclear medium and the distortion of the final pion .",
    "the distorted pion wave function is obtained by solving the klein gordon equation with an optical potential based on the @xmath3-hole model .",
    "both effects produce a large reduction of the cross section with respect to the impulse approximation .",
    "the distortion of the pion shifts the peak of the pion energy distributions towards low energies .",
    "the angular distributions are slightly widened by the nuclear medium effects .",
    "the a dependence of the coherent process has been investigated .",
    "we have found that the integrated cross section grows more slowly than one would naively expect due to the strong pion absorption and the effect of nuclear form factors .",
    "therefore , we do not expect that coherent pion production becomes more relevant with respect to the incoherent processes for heavier nuclei .",
    "we have also studied the cross sections averaged over the k2k and miniboone spectra . in the case of k2k",
    ", we find a cross section 30% larger than the upper limit estimated in the experiment .",
    "one should however remember that such upper limit is based on values for the cc cross sections on nuclei ( quasielastic , pion production , etc . ) which are not well known at the rather low energies discussed here .",
    "further improvements in the theoretical description of this reaction will require more precise data for the neutrino nucleon cross sections at low energies that could constrain the axial n-@xmath3 form factors .",
