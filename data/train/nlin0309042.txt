    "the localization of energy by nonlinearity in classical lattices has been much studied in the last 20 years .",
    "the corresponding localized states , known as intrinsic localized modes or discrete breathers , have been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental investigation @xcite .",
    "corresponding results on the quantum equivalent of discrete classical breathers are less numerous , c.f .",
    "@xcite for some theoretical results and @xcite for some experimental work .",
    "studies of quantum modes on small lattices may be relevant to studies of quantum dots and quantum computing ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this paper , we present some results related to quantum lattice problems , in particular in one dimensional lattices with a small number of quanta .",
    "we study a periodic lattice with @xmath0 sites containing bosons , described by the quantum discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( qdnls ) , a quantum version of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( also know as the boson hubbard model ) .",
    "the dnls equation describes a particularly simple model for a lattice of coupled anharmonic oscillators , and it has been used to describe the dynamics of a great variety of systems @xcite .",
    "the corresponding quantum hamiltonian is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are standard bosonic operators , @xmath4 is the ratio of anharmonicity to nearest neighbor hopping energy , and the chain is subject to periodic boundary conditions with period @xmath0 .",
    "initially we consider the case where the chain is translationally invariant , i.e. @xmath5 and @xmath6 are independent of @xmath7 . in general",
    "we take @xmath8 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham_bos ] ) has an important conserved quantity , the number @xmath9 , which enables the total hamiltonian to be block - diagonalised and greatly simplifies the analysis . in this letter",
    "we restrict ourselves to the simplest nontrivial case @xmath10 , though many of the results are valid for larger values on @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath10 bound states corresponds to bound two - vibron states , as observed experimentally in several systems @xcite .    in qdnls case",
    ", we use a number state basis , @xmath12 $ ] , where @xmath13 represents the number of quanta at site @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "a general wave function is @xmath16 .    in homogeneous quantum lattices with periodic boundary conditions",
    ", it is possible to block  diagonalize the hamiltonian operator using eigenfunctions of the translation operator with fixed value of the momentum @xmath17 @xcite .     for qdnls model with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 . ]    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , if the anharmonicity parameter is high enough , there exists an isolated eigenvalue for each @xmath17 which corresponds to a localized eigenfunction . by this",
    "we mean there is a high probability of finding the two quanta on the same site , but due to the translational invariance of the system , an equal probability of finding these two quanta at any site of the system . in these cases ,",
    "some analytical expressions can be obtained in some asymptotic limits ( solutions of this problem go back to the 30 s , for recent discussions see @xcite ) .    in particular , working at @xmath20 for simplicity , the ground state unnormalized eigenfunction is @xmath21+[020\\dots0]+\\dots+[0\\dots02]+o(\\gamma^{-1}),\\ ] ] i.e. on a lattice of length @xmath0 , the unnormalized coefficients @xmath22 of the first @xmath0 terms are equal to unity and the rest are @xmath23 . in the other extreme of complete spatial localization , one of these @xmath22 would be unity and the rest zero . in this letter",
    "we consider how these components change as the translational invariance of the lattice is broken in various ways .",
    "one simple way that translational invariance can be broken is by considering a finite chain with no - flux boundary conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian operator now can not be block - diagonalized using eigenvectors of the translation operator . in this case , the computational effort increases , but it is still possible to calculate the all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian operator , if @xmath0 and @xmath11 are small enough , by using algebraic manipulation methods and numerical eigenvalue solvers .",
    "the existence of local inhomogeneities or impurities in a system can affect the nonlinear localized modes considerably .",
    "also , in systems with both nonlinearity and impurities , it is important to understand the interplay between these two sources of localization . for these cases we break translational invariance by making one or more of the @xmath24 or the @xmath25 depend on @xmath7",
    "this may occur because of localized impurities , or because the chain geometry becomes non - uniform .",
    "two examples of non - uniform geometries are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "[ fig2]a shows a circular chain twisted into a figure - of - eight , so that two sites on the chain , which are distant measured along the length of the chain , become spatially close . this toy model for a globular protein",
    "was studied in @xcite , where it was shown that moving breathers described by the classical dnls equation could become trapped at the cross - over point . in the quantum case",
    "such a geometry can be modeled by adding a term such as @xmath26 to the hamiltonian , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the two sites brought close together by the twist , and @xmath29 is the separation distance relative to the unit length of the unperturbed chain .",
    "this can be considered as a special case of a chain with long - range coupling .",
    "see also @xcite for a more realistic protein simulation , and @xcite for other discussions on the effects of chain geometry on moving breathers .    the bent chain in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b shows another possible geometry which has been studied recently in the classical dnls case . in this case",
    "we have an abrupt bend which is simulated by adding an additional term as in ( [ lrterm ] ) but where @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the vertex of the bend . by varying the values of @xmath32 , all angles between 0 and @xmath33 can be simulated approximately .",
    "the influence of this geometry has been analyzed in the dnls context in @xcite , and in nonlinear klein  gordon systems in @xcite .",
    "this geometry is of interest in nonlinear photonic crystals waveguides and circuits @xcite .",
    "localization due to random variation of the lattice parameters has long been studied in the _ harmonic _ model since the pioneering work of anderson @xcite .",
    "our interest is to see what new localization effects the anharmonic terms bring to the model , and to what extent the anharmonic effects enhance the anderson - like localization effect when this is present in the harmonic model ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "see also the discussions in @xcite .",
    "most of our findings are not specific to the qdnls model , for example we have repeated our calculations using the attractive fermionic hubbard model with two particles of opposite spins .",
    "details will be given elsewhere .",
    "although all the models we consider have a conserved number , in general they are not quantum integrable .",
    "we now consider the effects introduced above in more detail .",
    "in this version of our model , in order to explore the interplay between the localization induced by the nonlinearity and the influence of a impurity in these localized states , we introduce a local inhomogeneity in the anharmonic parameter . to isolate the effect of the impurity of other effects related to the finite size of the chain , we retain the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the anharmonicity parameter is @xmath35 , and @xmath36 for @xmath37 .    in the homogeneous system ( @xmath38 ) , with @xmath39 large enough , as discussed above , the ground state is a localized in the sense that there exist a high probability to find the two quanta on the same site , but with equal probability at any site of the chain . for the chain with a point impurity , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the coefficients of some of the components of the ground state wave function for various values of @xmath40 .    ,",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath18 . ]",
    "the left hand figure shows the coefficients of the @xmath41,[020\\dots],\\dots$ ] components . as @xmath40 increases , these coefficients start from an initial spatially uniform distribution , but then localize around the site of the impurity , in this case at @xmath42 . at the largest value of @xmath40 shown , over 60% of the wave function",
    "is in the state @xmath43 $ ] , with the two bosons at site 10 .",
    "the right hand figure shows the corresponding coefficients of the @xmath44,[0110\\dots],\\dots$ ] components . again",
    "some localization is found as @xmath40 increases , but this effect is much weaker for these components .",
    "other components are even smaller .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we plot the size of the first three components of the type @xmath45 , [ 11 ] , [ 101]$ ] respectively , centred around site 10 , as a function of @xmath46 .",
    "the localization increases very rapidly with the magnitude of the impurity .    , @xmath19 .",
    "]    note that there is no anderson - like effect in this case as the harmonic terms are homogeneous .",
    "for the twisted chain as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , the only extra parameter is @xmath47 , the strength of the long range coupling between the two spatially adjacent sites @xmath28 and @xmath27 . as an example we consider the case @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . fig .",

    "similar results are obtained for other values of @xmath47 , with the strength of the localization depending on the size of @xmath47 .",

    "the lattice becomes a t - junction , a model of interest in its own right .",
    "it is interesting that the localization in the anharmonic model exhibits a maximum at @xmath59 , whereas in the harmonic case the maximum is at @xmath60 .",
