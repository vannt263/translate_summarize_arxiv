    "the interplanetary scintillation ( ips ) technique is a useful , convenient , remote - sensing method to probe the solar wind @xcite .",
    "it exploits the scattering of radio waves from a compact radio source by the density irregularities in the solar wind and provides information on the speed and turbulence spectrum of the solar wind plasma at the region of closest solar offset of the line of sight to the radio source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "when a comet plasma tail intersects the radio path , the electron density irregularities associated with the comet can cause an enhancement in the level of scintillation .",
    "several attempts have been made to estimate the turbulence associated with the cometary plasma by observing the occultation of radio source by the tail of comet @xcite .",
    "however , in order to confirm the effect of the cometary plasma as well as to assess the contribution to the level of turbulence imposed by any solar wind transients or disturbances , it is essential to simultaneously monitor a region just outside the tail of the comet during such observations .",
    "@xcite reported a significant increase in the plasma turbulence as the tail of comet halley approached a radio source .",
    "but , a rather similar enhancement in scintillation was also observed towards control sources , which were located outside the comet tail @xcite .",
    "this emphasized the need for near - simultaneous monitoring of ips through the tail of the comet as well as a region outside the comet tail .",
    "this study attributed an insignificant increase of turbulence associated with the cometary plasma . in a later work ,",
    "@xcite adopted the idea of near - simultaneous observation of control source during cometary occultation observation and reported a significant increase of the scintillation of the target source compared to that of the control source . in this letter",
    "we report the occultation of the compact radio source b0019@xmath0000 by the plasma tail of comet schwassmann - wachmann 3-b .",
    "the results are substantiate by the observations of the ips of a control source outside the tail .",
    "systematic changes observed in the ips spectra as the source approached the comet tail suggest a steeper turbulence spectrum for the cometary plasma at scales @xmath1500 km and excessive turbulence at the small - scale part ( i.e. , @xmath250 km ) of the spectrum .",
    "below , in  2 , we give the details of our observations and the results .",
    "we compare the results with previously reported results and discuss the actual astrophysical implication of the results in  3 .",
    "finally , we summarize and present our conclusions in  4 .",
    "the comet schwassmann - wachmann 3 ( also known as 73p / schwassmann - wachmann ) is a periodic comet .",
    "this jupiter - family comet passed within @xmath30.1 au of the earth around the middle of 2006 .",
    "it is to be noted that the comet was going through breaking and disintegration @xcite , which would likely to increase the level of turbulence .",
    "the occultation observation reported here was therefore aimed at estimating the turbulence spectrum of density irregularities and associated scale sizes of the cometary plasma .",
    "compact sources lying close to the path of the comet were chosen from the molonglo catalogue @xcite . on 2006",
    "may 26 , one of the fragments ( labeled 73p - b , the second brightest fragment at the time of observation ) aligned along the line of sight to the radio source b0019@xmath0000 , which has a compact component ( @xmath3 50 mas ) containing @xmath4 of the total flux density , s@xmath5=2.99@xmath60.14 jy .",
    "the line of sight along the radio source b0019@xmath0073 ( s@xmath5 = 1.83@xmath60.07 jy ) , was monitored as the control region .",
    "the systematic monitoring of these sources on the day of occultation as well as for the next two consecutive days provide the spectrum of the density irregularities and dominant scale sizes of the cometary plasma .",
    "this target of opportunity observation was carried out using the ooty radio telescope ( ort ) at the radio astronomy centre , ooty @xcite .",

    "the positions of the comet on these days are taken from the online high - precision ephemerides provided by jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) solar system dynamics group .",
    "the target source was observed during occultation on 2006 may 26 from 0713 to 0804 ut ( when the target hour angle reached the west limit of the ort ) at 326.5 mhz with a total bandwidth of 4.0 mhz and a time resolution of 20 ms . during this span",

    "note that the control source is sufficiently close to the target source .",
    "so , these two lines of sight are expected to have similar solar wind characteristics .",

    "the changes in the spectra during the occultation are attributed to the turbulence in the comet plasma tail .",

    "this corresponds to @xmath33 mjy .",
    "please note that the peak scintillation index is @xmath34 for this source .",

    "( [ eqn : eqn1 ] ) , the normalized level of turbulence @xmath36 in the comet plasma tail compared to that in the solar wind . we assume typical values for @xmath37 and @xmath38 to be @xmath39 and @xmath40 km , respectively .",
    "considering that the radio source line of sight probes the plasma tail at about @xmath41 km away from the nucleus and that the angular size of the coma was @xmath42 , the expected value of @xmath38 is @xmath43 km . @xmath44 km may be taken as an upper limit and , for smaller values of @xmath38 , the corresponding value of @xmath45 will increase .",

    "we summarize the result of plasma turbulence enhancement in table ( [ tab : tab3 ] ) .",
    "we present the detection of a rare event of the occultation of a compact source ( b0019@xmath0000 ) by the plasma tail of comet schwassmann - wachmann 3-b using scintillation observation and the power spectral analysis .",
    "it is interesting to compare the present results with the earlier reports of both detections and non - detections of enhanced scintillation .",
    "the range of values of the normalized plasma turbulence from similar observations spread over almost an order of magnitude @xcite for a given set of parameters ( e.g. , @xmath38 , @xmath50 ) .",
    "in addition to that , the turbulence level is likely to change systematically with the distance from the nucleus of the comet along the plasma tail axis . in other words ,",
    "occultation observations probe the plasma at different distances from the comet nucleus and hence may reveal a variety of turbulence levels .",
    "hence a straightforward quantitative comparison of plasma turbulence is not possible .",
    "but from earlier results , the clear trend emerges that most of the negative results can be attributed to a chance of actually probing a lower level of turbulence in the occultation events @xcite for various reasons .",
    "the rest of the cases with favorable observing geometry have resulted in a positive detection . in the present study , given the possibility of enhanced level of turbulence because of the ongoing disintegration and the small offset of the line of sight from the nucleus of the comet , our result is in good agreement with this scenario .",
    "the change of the intensity fluctuation power spectra has contributions in two distinct scales .",
    "the steepening of the spectrum at low frequency indicates scale sizes in the intervening plasma at high spatial scales and remarkable turbulence enhancement associated in this spectral region . for a typical solar wind speed of 400 km s@xmath16",
    ", it translates to linear scales of @xmath17 km . at the later part of the observation , at the close encounter of the comet nucleus and the line of sight to the radio source",
    ", we notice the additional significant contribution in the power spectrum at the low - frequency region , which corresponds to linear scales of @xmath18 km .",
    "it is to be noted that the ips measurements normally show much less turbulence at these small scales .",
    "the evolution of the spectrum with time during the course of the occultation indicates that the plasma turbulence level is dominated by small - scale density irregularities closer to the tail axis .",
    "however , it is the large - scale irregularities , developed most likely due to the interaction of plasma with the ambient solar wind and the evaporation process , that contribute significantly at the outer part of the tail .",
    "this shows the presence of two main regimes of turbulence in the comet plasma tail .",
    "this is found to be in agreement with the earlier reported results of @xcite for the cases of comet halley and comet wilson , where similar two - regime plasma turbulences were detected .",
    "we have present the results from the occultation observation of a compact radio source b0019@xmath0000 at 326.5 mhz through the plasma tail of comet schwassmann - wachmann 3-b .",
    "we detect significant enhancement in the scintillation index and change in the intensity fluctuation power spectrum during the occultation period .",
    "the systematic study of the evolution of power spectrum clearly reveals the dominant effect of large - scale ( @xmath17 km ) density fluctuations and the presence of a smaller scale ( @xmath18 km ) closer to the tail axis .",
    "since the shape of the power spectra of all the control observations show normal quiet solar wind condition , these changes at the time of occultation are attributed to the plasma tail of the comet .",
    "this clearly shows the presence of a two - regime plasma turbulence with two distinct scales of density irregularities that may arise from the interaction of solar wind with the comet plasma tail .",
