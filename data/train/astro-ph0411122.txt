    "remarkable progress has been made in the characterization of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) over the last several years .",
    "it was nearly 30 years after the initial discovery of the cmb by penzias and wilson in 1965@xcite before small differences in its intensity were measured by cobe@xcite and its spectrum was shown to be a blackbody to high precision@xcite .",
    "the remarkable isotropy , precise to a part in @xmath1 , helped motivate the inflation theory for the origin of the universe . in the past few years , subsequent measurements of the first acoustic peak and its harmonics in the angular power spectrum@xcite provided further support for inflation by showing the curvature of the universe was flat",
    ". they also allowed a full accounting for the matter - energy densities of the universe , finding in agreement with the analysis of type 1a supernovae observations@xcite that the universe is now dominated by some sort of `` dark energy '' that apparently is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate .",
    "more recently the _ wmap _ satellite has produced spectacular all sky maps of the temperature anisotropy yielding a highly precise measurement of the angular power spectrum up to multipoles of @xmath2 , corresponding to an angular scale of @xmath3@xcite .",
    "the _ wmap _",
    "data , especially combined with finer angular scale cmb anisotropy measurements made with acbar@xcite and cbi@xcite and with other probes of large scale structure have provided a high degree of confidence in the now standard cosmological model and allowed tight constraints to be placed on many of its parameters@xcite .",
    "while these measurements have led to rapid progress in our understanding of the universe , they have raised even more profound questions about the nature of dark energy and of the possibility of directly testing inflation and determining its energy scale .",
    "remarkably , these questions can be addressed through future measurements of the cmb temperature anisotropy on fine angular scales and of the cmb polarization anisotropy on all angular scales ; they form the basis of the scientific case for the south pole telescope ( spt ) program .",
    "finer angular scale temperature anisotropy measurements are needed to precisely measure the angular power spectrum through the damping tail@xcite .",
    "such observations will lead to better parameter constraints and in particular allow a better characterization of the underlying primordial matter power spectrum , that in principle can be used to constrain inflationary models@xcite . on angular scales of a few arcminutes and smaller ,",
    "i.e. , multipoles exceeding @xmath4 , the cmb anisotropy is dominated by secondary effects caused by distortions of the cmb as it passes through the universe .",
    "the largest such effect is the sunyaev - zeldovich effect@xcite ( sze ) , in which the cmb photons are inverse compton scattered by the hot intracluster gas of galaxy clusters .",
    "the sze is a potentially powerful probe of cosmology@xcite .",
    "perhaps its most powerful use will be to enable large area , redshift independent surveys for galaxy clusters .",
    "as the growth of massive clusters is critically dependent on the underlying cosmology , the yields from such surveys can be used to set tight constraints on cosmological parameters and to investigate the nature of dark energy , i.e. , by determining its equation of state@xcite .",
    "measurements of the polarization of the cmb are extremely challenging , but also have enormous potential for discovery .",
    "the intrinsic polarization of the cmb reflects the local radiation field anisotropy , specifically the local quadrupole moment of the incident radiation field , at the surface of last scattering 14 billion years ago@xcite .",
    "the dominant contribution is due to doppler shifted radiation fields arising from the acoustic oscillations at the time of last scattering .",
    "this causes the so called e - mode polarization ( curl free polarization patterns on the sky ) and has been detected by dasi@xcite , while the temperature - polarization cross power spectrum ( te ) has been detected by dasi and _ wmap_@xcite . however , if inflation occurred in the early universe at a high - enough energy scale , a portion of the local quadrupole at last scattering will be due to primordial gravitational waves created during the inflationary epoch@xcite .",
    "the inflationary gravitational waves will cause both e - mode and b - mode ( curl component ) polarization patterns in the cmb@xcite . while the b - mode pattern can be distinguished from the intrinsic e - mode pattern , the gravitational lensing of the cmb by large scale structure in the universe will create b - mode polarization from the intrinsic e - mode signal at a level that is higher than the inflationary b - modes for all but the most optimistic inflationary models . in this case , the only hope in recovering the inflationary b - modes from the lensing b - mode foreground lies in exploiting the different angular power spectra and their correlations with the temperature and e - mode spectra@xcite .",
    "the lensing polarization signal is also interesting in its own right as it can be used to trace the growth of large scale structure which in turn is sensitive to the mass of the neutrino and the equation of state of the dark energy .",
    "this paper presents the design for a new telescope , the south pole telescope ( spt ) , that is being designed to pursue the next generation cmb temperature and polarizaton studies at the exceptional south pole site .",
    "the telescope is designed explicitly for conducting large area , high sensitivity survey observations of the temperature and polarization of the cmb .",
    "the spt has an off - axis 10 meter diameter aperture to provide 1@xmath5 resolution at 2 mm wavelength with exceptionally low spillover .",
    "the optics will support a one degree diameter field of view . to further reduce signals due to scattering and spillover",
    ", the entire telescope will be deployed within a large reflecting ground screen .",
    "deployment is planned for late 2006 , with first observations starting early 2007 .",
    "the properties of the south pole site are reviewed briefly in section  [ sec : site ] and the telescope is discussed in section  [ sec : telescope ] .",
    "state of the art bolometer detectors used for ground - based cmb observations are essentially background limited . in this case , the obvious path to higher sensitivity is to add more detectors . the initial spt receiver will be dedicated for fine angular scale cmb temperature and sze survey observations .",
    "it will consist of an array of 1000 micro - lithographed bolometers with transition edge sensors ( tes ) read out with a novel frequency multiplexing scheme . while a polarization - sensitive receiver is planned ,",
    "only technology development funds have been obtained for it at this time .",
    "the details and status of the sze survey receiver are outlined in section  [ sec : receiver ] .",
    "a review of the initial spt science goals and consideration of astronomical foregrounds , atmospheric emission and the implications of these on the definition of the receiver bands and the observing strategy is given section  [ sec : science ] .",
    "ground based astronomical observations at mm and sub - mm wavelengths place extreme requirements on the transmission and stability of the atmosphere .",
    "steady atmospheric emission loads the bolometric detectors and adds photon noise , reducing overall sensitivity .",
    "fluctuations in atmospheric brightness add noise to the detector timestream data as well . for these reasons high altitude sites , preferably with stable atmospheric conditions , are needed for ground based observations such as those targeted by the spt .",
    "emission from the atmosphere consists of two components , one due to  dry air \" which results from the wings of oxygen lines and a second component due to water vapor .",
    "dry air \" component is well - mixed in the atmosphere and produces a signal that is only a function of elevation , commonly removed by beam switching .",
    "water vapor , on the other hand , exhibits considerable variations in its density .",
    "these fluctuations in water vapor density result in spatial variations in the brightness of the sky .",
    "the south pole lies on the antarctic plateau , at an altitude of 2800  m. the average atmospheric pressure in the winter is 675 millibars .",
    "in addition , the low temperature at the south pole reduces the water vapor content of the atmosphere , lowering both atmospheric emission and fluctuations in brightness .",
    "there is a long history of measuring atmospheric properties relevant to millimeter - wave observing at the south pole ; profiles of the atmospheric temperature , pressure , and water vapor have been measured at least once a day for several decades by the south pole meteorology office , using balloon - borne radiosondes .",
    "schwerdtfeger@xcite comprehensively reviewed the climate of the antarctic plateau , and found that the weather is bi - modal : 60% of the time the sky is clear with low precipitable water vapor ( pwv ) and weak katabatic winds ( 3 to @xmath6 ) emanating from the east antarctic plateau ; 30% of the time is cloudy with higher pwv and stronger winds ( 6 to @xmath7 ) emanating from the weddell sea .",
    "incidentally , the highest wind speed at the south pole measured during continuous monitoring between 1957 and 1983 was only @xmath8 , and for many months the wind speed did not exceed @xmath9 .",
    "this low  maximum wind speed \" is favorable from a telescope construction standpoint .",
    "in addition to the meteorological measures , the millimeter and sub - millimeter opacity at the pole has been measured by several experiments in the past decade @xcite .",
    "the results show that deep millimeter - wave observations are possible most of the time ; the median winter pwv@xcite is only 0.25 mm as the air is dessicated by frigid temperatures ( annual average : @xmath10 , minimum temperature : @xmath11 ) .    as mentioned previously ,",
    "atmospheric stability is of extreme importance for our measurements .",
    "spatial fluctuations in the brightness of the sky result in temporal noise in detector timestream data as the telescope moves the beam across the sky , or as the wind blows the atmosphere through the beam . as a function of angular scale",
    ", the power in atmospheric fluctuations is well described by a kolmogorov spectrum and therefore falls rapidly with decreasing angular scale .    lay and halverson@xcite used observations made with the python experiment operating at @xmath12ghz to characterize atmospheric fluctuations at the south pole during the austral summer .",
    "they compared the results of the python experiment with the site testing interferometer at chajnantor@xcite through fits to a parametric model and found that the amplitude of the sky noise at the south pole in the summer is 10 to 50 times less than that at chajnantor .",
    "more recently , the sky noise during the austral winter at the south pole was characterized in detail at frequencies of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15ghz by the acbar@xcite experiment .",
    "et al _ used the correlation between acbar detectors to characterize the atmospheric fluctuation power in the presence of detector noise over the entire winter@xcite . using the water vapor opacity predicted by the modified atm code@xcite",
    ", we compared the acbar results with those of the python experiment and found that the median fluctuation power during austral winter is approximately 20 times smaller than in the summer .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : atmo ] , we have used atmospheric noise simulations normalized by the acbar measurements of atmospheric fluctuation power at the south pole to simulate spt scan strategies in the presence of such atmospheric noise . the combination of the observed atmospheric power , wind speed , and angular scale of interest was used to compute a minimum telescope scan speed below which the atmospheric noise becomes comparable to the detector noise .",
    "the excellent atmospheric noise properties at the pole enable quite low scanning speeds ( as low as @xmath16/s ) with only a small impact on our science goals ; this has in turn allowed the very clean spt optical design which relies on telescope scanning ( rather than a moving mirror ) to move the array response across the sky .",
    "the spt will be a 10-m off - axis gregorian telescope on an alt - az mount .",
    "the general arrangement is shown in figure  [ fig : sptga ] .",
    "the telescope design is driven by the demanding science goals ( see section  [ sec : science ] ) which require high sensitivity measurements of low contrast differential emission over a broad survey region .",
    "a large instantaneous field of view , low system noise , and stringent control of systematic offsets such as differential pickup of thermal ground emission are essential .",
    "the telescope has key features designed to meet these needs :    1 .",
    "high throughput .",
    "the spt has a @xmath17 deg@xmath18 diffraction - limited field of view at @xmath19  mm , so it can support cameras with several thousand detectors .",
    "2 .   low noise .",
    "the off - axis design gives low scattering , the gaps between primary panels are sealed , and the beam is well shielded .",
    "there are shields around the beam along the secondary support structure , and the entire telescope sits inside a large , stationary , conical ground shield .",
    "the primary is equipped with de - icing heaters to prevent ice from accumulating on the panels .",
    "all these lead to low optical loading on the detectors , in turn leading to high sensitivity .",
    "3 .   low offsets . the entire telescope can be chopped and scanned , so the beam does not move on the telescope mirrors .",
    "the drive supports @xmath20s@xmath21 slew rate in elevation , @xmath22s@xmath21 in azimuth , @xmath22s@xmath23 acceleration in both axes , and position switching over @xmath24 in 1.5 s ( settling within 3 arcseconds of the required position ) .",
    "in addition , the extensive ground shielding leads to low sidelobe response in the direction of local features ( eg buildings , and the horizon ) .",
    "submillimeter operation .",
    "the primary has a surface accuracy of @xmath25 @xmath26 m rms , and the pointing accuracy of the telescope is @xmath27 arcseconds rms , so operation at wavelengths as short as",
    "@xmath28 @xmath26 m will be possible .",
    "the telescope is being built by vertexrsi .",
    "it will be assembled and tested in the us in jan  may 2006 , prior to deployment at the south pole in nov 2006jan 2007 .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]      the 10-m f/0.7 spt primary design has lightweighted machined aluminum panels ( each roughly @xmath29 m ) , mounted on a carbon fiber reinforced plastic ( cfrp ) back - up structure ( bus ) .",
    "the panels will have @xmath30 @xmath26 m rms surface accuracy .",
    "differential contraction between the bus  and panels makes the panel gaps wider at lower ambient temperatures ; if unaddressed , the effect of these gaps ( emission and scattering ) would increase as the atmosphere improves .",
    "at the south pole , the temperature of the primary could be as high as @xmath31c in summer , and to prevent the panels from touching at this temperature the panel gaps must be @xmath32 mm at @xmath33c .",
    "emission from the gaps , and offsets due to small movements of the beam relative to the gaps , are a serious concern , so we plan to cover the gaps with @xmath34 mm thick metal strips held in place by spring fingers .",
    "ice on the primary panels increases the telescope emission , and causes slowly - varying offsets , and ice in the panel gaps can change the alignment of the panels .",
    "some telescopes at the south pole have employed manual de - icing techniques , but these are impractical for a 10-m telescope .",
    "the spt primary will be equipped with de - icing heaters , e.g. , heat blankets on the bus , or hot air blowing between the bus and the panels .",
    "in addition , we will select a panel surface finish that discourages ice accumulation .",
    "we are currently testing a variety of finishes at the south pole , e.g. , polished , etched , anodized , and sio@xmath35 coated .",
    "initial results from this test indicate that @xmath36 wm@xmath23k@xmath21 is required to heat the panels , a few k temperature rise is enough to de - ice the panels on timescales of a day or two , and the different surface finishes have roughly similar icing characteristics ( but the coated surfaces are generally colder than the bare aluminum surfaces ) .",
    "since de - icing can be done with a very small temperature increase , we are currently planning to run the de - icing heaters continuously at low power .",
    "this avoids the problem of having to wait for the primary to recover its profile after high - power de - icing , and reduces the peak demand on the south pole power plant .",
    "the spt  primary has 217 panels , each with 4 axial and 3 in - plane adjusters . the surface will be aligned initially to @xmath37 @xmath26 m rms based on photogrammetry measurements , and later to @xmath25 @xmath26 m rms based on holography .",
    "setting all the panel adjusters under the conditions at the south pole will be a difficult task , so access to the adjusters is from inside the bus .",
    "this is a cramped environment , but it provides protection from the wind , and allows access to the adjusters without a crane or man lift .      low noise is a critical requirement for the spt , so the design includes several levels of shielding .",
    "the inner shield is a trough running along the secondary support as shown in figure  [ fig : sptga ] .",
    "gaps between the inner shield , primary and secondary support are sealed with reflecting material , and the top edges of the shield and primary are rolled with a radius of a few cm to reduce scattering .",
    "the inner shield does not have de - icing heaters , so it will require occasional brushing to remove snow ( through doors at the bottom of the shield near the primary ) .",
    "the outer shield is an enormous inverted cone around the entire telescope .",
    "the wall angle of the cone is shallow enough to prevent radiation being trapped between the shield and the ( reflective ) back of the primary , so the shield does not require a floor .",
    "this makes snow removal much easier .",
    "the shield is made of 1.25-mm thick aluminum panels @xmath38 m across ( the width of an lc130 aircraft ) supported by a steel spaceframe .",
    "the panels are finished with a smooth epoxy phenolic coating to encourage snow shedding .",
    "a @xmath39 wide section of the shield can be lowered to allow short , occasional observations near the horizon , e.g. , calibration observations of planets , and holography using a test source on a tower .",
    "ray tracing of the telescope with inner and outer shields shows that variations in ground pickup will be @xmath40mk per degree change in elevation .",
    "the spt primary and secondary are mounted on a massive l - shaped frame on an alt - az fork mount ( see figure  [ fig : sptga ] ) .",
    "the mount is made entirely of steel , and the crfp bus is attached to the steel l - frame via an invar cone .",
    "the mount is balanced about both axes to minimize deflections in the structure and settling of the foundation , but this requires a large elevation counterweight .",
    "the azimuth bearing is at the top of a conical pedestal , which is supported by a massive spaceframe sitting on wood footings .",
    "the base of the pedestal is @xmath41 m above the ice to reduce snow drifting around the structure .",
    "table  [ tab : mass ] shows the masses of the major components of the spt .",
    "each component is designed so that it can be broken down into parts that will fit in an lc130  aircraft ( which can carry about 11 metric tons ) .",
    "each axis has two pairs of torque - biased motors .",
    "the azimuth motors drive a ring gear inside the azimuth bearing , and the elevation  motors drive sector gears on each side of the l - arm .",
    "the yoke and l - frame contain cfrp reference structures with displacement sensors to measure gravitational and thermal deflections of the mount .",
    "an active optical bench , which is coupled to the reference frame system , supports the secondary and camera . in this configuration ,",
    "the relative positions of the secondary , lens and detector array are fixed and the entire assembly is continuously adjusted ( with a control bandwidth of @xmath34 hz ) to maintain its position with respect to the primary .",
    "the mount also has tiltmeters above and below the azimuth bearing to measure changes in the tilt of the structure ( which are included in the pointing model with a bandwidth of @xmath34 hz ) .",
    "all the spt  drive components are modular , moving parts and critical electronics are in warm environments , and the drive motors , gearboxes , encoders , reference frame sensors and tiltmeters can be reached from the control room without going outside .",
    "the outside of the mount is insulated to reduce differential cooling , and interior spaces in the pedestal and fork are warmed by air from the control room .    the receiver cabin is a large ( @xmath42 m long @xmath43 3 m high @xmath43 2.5 m wide ) shielded and insulated room at the end of the l - frame .",
    "this provides a laboratory environment for optics and cameras , with enough space to accommodate future optical configurations with many mirrors and several optical benches . a door in the floor of the cabin mates with a hatch in the control room roof when the telescope is at the horizon ( see figure  [ fig : sptga ] ) .",
    "access to the cabin is also possible from outside , through the l - frame , in any telescope position .",

    "the statistical arrival of photons presents a fundamental limitation to the sensitivity of bolometric detectors , which has been reached for small ground - based arrays of detectors operating at mm - wavelengths@xcite .",
    "the spt science objectives require significant advances in mapping speed ; to achieve this , the spt receiver will be based on a focal plane with 1000 superconducting transition edge sensor ( tes ) bolometers .",
    "observations will be done sequentially in at least three frequency bands to enable spectral separation of various celestial sources .",
    "reading out 1000 cryogenic detectors poses a technological challenge ; we plan to use a squid - based frequency domain multiplexer readout to minimize the complexity and heat load of cold wiring .",
    "to minimize maintenance and cost of operation , the bolometer camera will be cooled by the combination of a @xmath44 closed cycle refrigerator and a mechanical refrigerator that reaches @xmath45k without liquid cryogens . in the following sections we describe the detector array , cryogenics , readout technology and cryostat optics .",
    "the spt focal - plane array will use horn - coupled spider - web bolometers with superconducting transition - edge sensors ( tes ) . compared with conventional semiconductor - based technologies ,",
    "tes detectors offer several advantages for the construction of large arrays .",
    "first , the bolometers are produced entirely by thin - film deposition and optical lithography , greatly simplifying fabrication and improving the uniformity of devices .",
    "second , readout multiplexing technologies have been developed for tes detectors that have the potential to greatly reduce the complexity and cost of large arrays .",
    "other benefits include high linearity and well controlled responsivity independent of base temperature and optical - loading , due to the tes s strong electrothermal feedback effect .",
    "in addition , voltage biased tes bolometers are also quite insensitive to vibration by virtue of their low impedance .",
    "the spt array will be assembled from 6 pie - shaped wedges each with approximately 160 bolometric detectors .",
    "each detector consists of a small al / ti bi - layer tes suspended on a gold - covered silicon nitride spider - web absorber .",
    "we have fabricated 55 element prototype wedges of tes detectors on 4 inch wafers with high yield , like those shown in figures  [ fig : array ] and [ fig : closewedge ] .",

    "each bolometer is part of a series - resonant lc circuit , which is tuned to the appropriate bias frequency .",
    "this allows the bias frequencies for all bolometers in a module to be applied through a single wire , as the tuned circuit selects the appropriate frequency for each bolometer .",
    "thus only two wires are needed to connect the bolometers of a readout module on the @xmath78 stage to the @xmath79 stage on which the squids are mounted .",
    "the tuned circuits also limit the bandwidth of the bolometer s johnson noise , which would otherwise contribute to the noise in all other channels of the module .",
    "the comb of amplitude modulated carriers at the squid output is transmitted to a bank of demodulators that mix the signals back down to base - band .",
    "the signals are then filtered and digitized , and all outputs in the array are sampled synchronously .",
    "multiplexing of 8 channels has been demonstrated and the limit to the number of channels per readout module is being explored . the high - q superconducting lc filters use lithographed inductors and commercial np0 ceramic chip capacitors .",
    "all inductors have the same value , so the @xmath80 increases with frequency to maintain constant bandwidth .",
    "a 16  @xmath26h inductor together with the bolometer resistance determines the bandwidth ( 5  khz ) , and the capacitor sets the frequency of each channel .",
    "both the inductors and chip capacitors are compact and together occupy an area comparable to a single pixel in the array .",
    "the filters will be mounted on a board underneath the bolometer array .",
    "the squid parameters must be chosen carefully to achieve the required noise performance and dynamic range .",
    "it is necessary to use squid devices with a small input coil to accommodate large amplitude carriers and reduce susceptibility to spurious pickup that degrades squid performance .",
    "this necessitates a large transimpedance of the squid amplifier to override the noise of the warm electronics . to meet these requirements , we utilize 100-element series array squid amplifiers supplied by nist @xcite .",
    "the squids are packaged on pc - boards in groups of 8 as shown in figure  [ fig : squids ] .",
    "squids are extremely sensitive to magnetic fields and must be shielded very carefully ; each board is enclosed in a cryoperm shield as shown in figure  [ fig : cryoperm ] .",
    "in addition , each squid array is individually mounted on a thin niobium film to pin the residual magnetic field .",
    "the attenuation achieved with this cryoperm / nb shielding is better than a part - per - million at the frequencies of interest .",
    "maintaining constant voltage bias for the bolometers necessitates that all impedances between the bolometer and the bias resistor are much smaller than the bolometer resistance .",
    "thus , the squid amplifier is operated with shunt feedback to obtain a low input impedance , while linearizing the squid response and extending the signal range to accommodate the high level bias carrier signals .",
    "the required gain - bandwidth product of the feedback loop requires short connections , so the squid controller is mounted directly on the side of the receiver cryostat .",
    "the noise of the readout system is less than 10  pa@xmath81 and lies well below the noise floor of the detectors planned for spt .",
    "the system has the large dynamic range and bandwidth ( 1 mhz ) required for frequency domain multiplexing .",
    "the squid controller and demodulator are computer controlled with extensive monitoring and diagnostic capabilities .",
    "the amplified comb of carriers are passed from the squid controller to the oscillator / demodulator boards shown in figure  [ fig : oscboards ] .",
    "each board combines 16 demodulator channels .",
    "since one demodulator channel is used for each bolometer , about 60 boards are required for spt .",
    "three 9u vme crates accommodate the readout , which is mounted in a separate rack near the cryostat .",
    "the high frequency bias carriers are generated by direct digital synthesizers ( dds ) , which provide precise frequency and amplitude control with very low sideband noise .",
    "the same dds that generates the bolometer bias also provides the local oscillator signal for the corresponding demodulator .",
    "the demodulator circuit utilizes a sampling demodulator with very high dynamic range  @xcite followed by an 8 pole low - pass anti - aliasing filter , and a 14 bit analog - to - digital converter .",
    "a field programmable gate array assembles the data from all channels on a given board and streams it to the data acquisition computer .",
    "final testing of the oscillator / demodulator production prototypes is underway .",
    "[ sec : clusters ] the high sensitivity and high angular resolution of the spt will enable several ambitious scientific programs . the initial observational program will be a large survey for galaxy clusters detected by the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) .",
    "the sze is produced when cmb photons scatter off the hot electron gas in galaxy clusters  @xcite ; the brightness of the sze is nearly independent of distance to the cluster , making it an ideal tool for conducting a mass - limited cluster survey  @xcite .",
    "the abundance of massive clusters as a function of redshift is highly sensitive to the efficiency with which structure can grow , which is in turn sensitive to the expansion history of the universe .",
    "therefore as shown in figure  [ fig : dndz ] , the redshift evolution of the abundance of massive clusters is critically sensitive to cosmological parameters such as the amount of dark energy and its equation of state .",
    "the spt sze survey will enable strong constraints on the amount of and nature of dark energy in the universe .",

    "new experiments are now focusing on characterizing the temperature fluctuations on finer angular scales , where secondary anisotropies are expected to dominate over fluctuations imprinted on the last scattering surface  @xcite .    as shown in figure  [ fig : clcmb ]",
    ", the largest source of anisotropy at multipole values @xmath83 is expected to be the thermal sze .",
    "measurements of the angular power spectrum of this signal  including or removing the massive clusters detected in the sze survey  will allow tight determinations of the parameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 that are complementary to those obtained with analysis of the cluster survey  @xcite .",
    "the thermal sze signal has a unique spectral signature .",
    "there is a null in the spectrum near 220  ghz , and the signal appears as a flux decrement ( relative to the 2.7k background ) at frequencies below this null and an increment at higher frequencies .",
    "this opens the potential for separating the sze component from other contributions to the cmb power spectrum , such as the kinetic sze ( ksz , due to the net motion of a cluster along the line of sight ) and the ostriker - vishniac ( ov ) effect , which is a similar effect produced by structures that are still in the linear regime .",
    "figure  [ fig : clcmb ] shows how well an ideal 500  spt survey could measure the fine - scale ksz / ov anisotropy signal , assuming perfect compensation for the thermal sze signal and other astrophysical contaminants .      as discussed in section  [ sec : site ] , spatial fluctuations in atmospheric emission that are driven through the telescope beam by wind or scanning cause variations in the detector timestreams loosely referred to as  atmospheric noise \" .",
    "the extent to which atmospheric noise dominates instrument noise depends on the details of the site , telescope and detector array properties , frequency bands and observing strategy .    we have used a model of the fluctuations in atmospheric emission at the south pole based on on the acbar observations  @xcite to simulate two simple methods of removing atmospheric noise for a variety of telescope scan speeds .",
    "the first method is to apply a simple high - pass filter to the detector time - stream data , removing low - frequency atmospheric ( and cosmic ) signals .",
    "the second method exploits the extensive overlap of beams from various detectors in the array at the height of the turbulent layer in the atmosphere  @xcite . in practice",
    ", we fit several spatial fourier components across the array at each time step to remove the common - mode signal from each detector s time - stream data .",
    "figure  [ fig : maps ] shows results from simple binning of a simulated spt observation of primary cmb and sze signals using a relatively slow scan rate of @xmath86 with the data processed according to the two methods described above to remove atmospheric fluctuations .",
    "we have tuned both methods to remove the same amount of atmospheric contamination .",
    "it is clear in the figure that the common - mode analysis retains cluster information on scales beyond typical cluster radii and also retains much of the cmb information . the high - pass filter , however , removed much of the larger - scale information .",
    "galaxy clusters are easy to detect in both cases . with these algorithms and",
    "anticipated levels of detector and atmospheric noise , the cluster mass detection limit is only @xmath87 higher at a scan rate of @xmath86 compared with an  infinite \" scan speed .",

    "synchrotron emission from galaxies and agns is thought to be the main mechanism for radio point source emission at frequencies less than @xmath91 ghz .",
    "the steeply falling spectrum of synchrotron emission should make these sources a negligible contaminant at 150  ghz ; however , there is evidence for a population of flat or inverted - spectrum sources  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is strong evidence that radio sources are preferentially associated with clusters , thus amplifying their contamination of sze cluster surveys  @xcite .",
