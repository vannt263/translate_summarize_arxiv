    "it is recognized that the resonant waves with special velocity of the concentrated vortex interact with flow for the shear instability @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which finally results in the well known miles - howard theorem @xcite . according to this theorem , the flow is stable to perturbations when the richardson number @xmath8 ( ratio of stratification to shear ) exceeds a critical value @xmath9 everywhere . in three - dimensional stratified flow , the corresponding criterion is @xmath10 @xcite",
    "however , the stabilization effect of buoyancy is a illusion . in a less known paper ,",
    "@xcite had shown with several special examples that stratification effects can be destabilizing due to the vorticity generated by non - homogeneity , and the instability depends on the details of the velocity and density profiles .",
    "one instability is called as holmboe instability @xcite .",
    "then @xcite stated three main points from the examples without any further proof .",
    "( a ) stratification may shift the band of unstable wave numbers so that some which are stable at homogeneous cases become unstable .",
    "( b ) conditions ensuring stability in homogeneous flow ( such as the absence of a vorticity maximum ) do not necessarily carry over to the stratified case , so that static stability can destabilize .",
    "( c ) new physical mechanisms brought in by the stratification may lead to instability in the form of a pair of growing and propagating waves where in the homogeneous case one had a stationary wave .",
    "recall the points by @xcite , and that there is a big gap between rayleigh s criterion and miles - howard criterion , @xcite even wrote ",
    "miles criterion for stability is not the nature generalization of rayleigh s well - known sufficient condition for the stability of a homogeneous fluid in shear flow \" .",
    "the mystery of the instability is still cover for us .",
    "following the frame work of @xcite , this study is an attempt to clear the confusion in theories .",
    "we find that the flow instability is due to the competition of the kinetic energy with the potential energy , which is dominated by the total froude number @xmath1 . and",
    "the unexpected assumption in miles - howard theorem leads the contradiction to other theories .",
    "the miles - howard criterion is one of the most important theorem for stably stratified shear flow . according to this theorem , the flow is stable to perturbations when the richardson number @xmath8 exceeds a critical value @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this criterion is widely used in fluid dynamics , astrophysical fluid dynamics , oceanography , meteorology , etc .",
    "specifically , it is the most important criterion for turbulence genesis in ocean modelling @xcite .",
    "using arnold s method @xcite , the the corresponding criterion for three - dimensional stratified flow is @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is widely believed that the stable stratification do favor the stability , and that all perturbations should decay when @xmath11 ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the experiments indicate otherwise .",
    "in fact , the flow might be unstable at very large @xmath8 @xcite . thus , to dispel the contradiction between the experiments and the miles - howard criterion , different explanations were postulated in literature :  this interval , @xmath12 , separates two different turbulent regimes : strong mixing and weak mixing rather than the turbulent and the laminar regimes , as the classical concept states \" @xcite , or ,  the richardson number criteria is not , in general , a necessary and sufficient condition \" @xcite .",
    "in fact , the miles - howard criterion is also in contradiction to other criteria for neutral stratification ( homogeneous ) fluid , e.g. , rayleigh - kuo s criterion ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , fjortoft s criterion @xcite , arnold s criteria @xcite and sun s criterion @xcite .",

    "\\end{array}\\label{eq : taylorgoldsteineq - hy}\\ ] ] the value of @xmath56 can be classified into 4 cases .",
    "the first and the second ones ( @xmath88 and @xmath100 at @xmath101 ) are similar to discussed above and shown in fig[fig : hy]a and fig[fig : hy]b . for such cases , we have a sufficient condition for instability , @xmath102 this can be derived directly from eq.([eq : stable_stratifiedflow_sun_int_rea ] ) , similar to corollary 1.1 .",
    "the first sufficient condition for instability is due to the shear instability , and the unstable criterion is eq.([eq : taylorgoldsteineq - sic1 ] ) .",
    "corollary 1.2 : if the velocity profile satisfies @xmath103 within the domain , the flow is unstable .",

    "the last one is unstable flow shown in fig.[fig : tg - hy]b , where @xmath96 and @xmath91 throughout . in the last case , the maximum of @xmath86 must be smaller than the minimum of @xmath87 so that a proper @xmath27 within the @xmath86 and @xmath87 could be used for the unstable waves . although the exact criterion can not be obtained as the required maximum and minimum can not be explicitly given , the approach is very straightforward .",
    "nevertheless , we can also obtain some approximate criterion for the fourth case .",

    "@xmath107    from the above corollaries , the flow might be unstable if the static stable stratification is strong enough .",
    "the stably stratification destabilize the flow , which is a new unstable mechanism .",
    "the above corollary contradicts the previous results @xcite , but it agrees well with the recent theory @xcite , experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite .",
    "again , we point out here that the flow is unstable due to potential energy transfer to kinetic energy under the condition of @xmath2 .",
    "this conclusion is new because it is quite different from previous theorems in which the static stable stratification plays the role as a stabilizing factor for shear flows .",
    "in the above investigation , it was found that stable stratification is a destabilization mechanism for the flow .",
    "such finding is not surprising if one notes the terms in eq.([eq : stable_stratifiedflow_taylorgoldsteineq ] ) .",
    "mathematically the sum of terms in square brackets should be negative for the wave solution .",
    "thus both @xmath108 and @xmath109 do favor this condition .",
    "this is why the unstable solutions always occur at @xmath110 in shear flow . and @xmath20 here might lead to @xmath54 .",
    "physically , the perturbation waves are truncated in the neutral stratified flow .",
    "but the stable stratification allows wide range of waves in the perturbation .",
    "such waves might interact with each other like what was illustrated in @xcite .    as theorem 1 is the only sufficient condition ,",
    "it is hypothesized that the criterion is not only the sufficient but also the necessary condition for instability in stably stratified flow .",
    "this hypothesis might be criticized in that the flow might be unstable ( @xmath54 ) if @xmath56 changes sign within the interval ( fig[fig : tg - hy]a ) , where a proper chosen @xmath21 would let the right hand of eq.([eq : stable_stratifiedflow_sun_int_rea ] ) become negative .    however , this criticism is not valid for the case in fig[fig : tg - hy]a .",
    "it is from the well - known criteria ( e.g. rayleigh s inflexion point theorem ) that the proper chosen @xmath21 always let the right hand of eq.([eq : stable_stratifiedflow_sun_int_rea ] ) vanish .",

    "the flow become unstable unless any choice of @xmath21 would let the right hand of eq.([eq : stable_stratifiedflow_sun_int_rea ] ) be negative .",
    "in this situation , we hypothesize that theorem 1 fully solves the stability problem .      in inviscid shear flows",
    ", it has been recognized that very short - wave perturbations are dynamically stable under neutral stratification , and the dynamic instability is due to the larger wavelengths @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that rayleigh s case is reduced to the kelvein - helmholtz vortex sheet model under the long - wave limit @xmath111 @xcite . we have shown that this can be extended to shear flows , and that the growth rate @xmath112 , is proportional to @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "such conclusion can be simply generated to the stratified shear flows , which can be seen from eq.([eq : stable_stratifiedflow_hygy ] ) .",
    "if @xmath23 is larger than a critical value @xmath114 , the sufficient condition in theorem 1 can not be satisfied and the flow is stable . for shortwave ( @xmath115 ) ,",
    "@xmath56 is always larger than that for long - wave @xmath111 .",
    "the long - wave instability in the stratified shear flow was also noted by @xcite and @xcite , who showed a likelihood of @xmath116 at @xmath117 .",
    "the long - wave instability theory can explain the results in numerical simulations @xcite , where the unstable perturbations are long - wave .      in the above investigations ,",
    "an parameter @xmath47 is used , which represents the ratio of two integrations with boundaries .",
    "so the criteria are global . on the other hand",
    ", we can also investigate the local balance without boundary conditions .",
    "for example , consider the flow within a thick layer @xmath118 .",
    "the velocity is @xmath119 , and the kinetic energy is @xmath120 .",
    "the stratification is @xmath68 , and the potential energy is @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the thickness of the layer .",
    "the froude number is @xmath123 for @xmath124 .",
    "the instability criterion in eq.([eq : stable_stratifiedflow - criterion ] ) becomes    @xmath125    if local gradient richardson number exceeds @xmath126 , the local disturbances is unstable .",
    "however , the flow might be stable as the globe total froude number @xmath3 .",
    "this criterion is opposite to miles - howard theorem , we will show why miles - howard theorem is not correct from their derivations .      in the inviscid",
    "shear flow , the linear theories , e.g. , rayleigh - kuo cirterion @xcite , fjrtoft criterion @xcite and sun s criterion @xcite , are equal to arnold s nonlinear stability criterion @xcite .",
    "arnold s first stability theorem corresponds to fjrtoft s criterion @xcite , and arnold s second nonlinear theorem corresponds to sun s criterion @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the present theory , especially corollary 1.1 is a natural generalization of inviscid theories .    in the stratified flow , @xcite and",
