    "the theory of personal constructs proposed by kelly @xcite in 1955 initiated the strong debates .",
    "this theory suggests that each person has one s own unique system of dichotomous ( bipolar ) constructs , which serve as special axes for  projecting \" self and other persons .",
    "most of the constructs may be mapped onto the scale of  good - bad \" .",
    "kelly @xcite developed the experimental approach for essembeling the list of personal constructs and a list of one s images of other people .",
    "the poles , the constructs are represented with , are of negative (  bad \" ) and positive (  good \" ) types .",
    "hereafter , the theory proposed by kelly will be referred as _ theory of bipolar constructs_. according to kelly , these poles should be chosen with equal probability .",
    "however the subsequent psychological experiments proved this suggestion wrong .    in earlier experiments ,",
    "it was shown by benjafield and adams - webber@xcite , adams - webber@xcite , benjafield and green @xcite , shalit @xcite , osgood and richards @xcite and osgood @xcite that under great variety of experimental conditions the positive pole is chosen with the frequency 0.62 .",
    "the persistent appearance of the frequency 0.62 resulted in two ways .",
    "first , the reasonable question `` what is the true value of the probability this frequency represents ? '' .",
    "second , it was suggested by lefebvre @xcite(p .",
    "291 ) that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  ... human cognition has a special mechanism for modeling self and others .",
    "it works as a universal ` inner computer ' and creates the core of the images that later are ` dressed ' and ` colored ' with nuances .",
    "the constant 0.62 is a characteritic of this ` computer ' . \" _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    it was determined by lefebvre that the true value of the frequency 0.62 is probability 0.618 ... , which is inverted golden ratio @xmath0 ( @xmath0 = 1.618 ... ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , the golden ratio , as being a characteristic of the ` inner computer ' , is related to the implicit primordial knowledge ( ipk ) @xcite .",
    "now we return to the theory of bipolar constructs .",
    "it had strong impact on subsequently conducted psychological researches .",
    "the research about the emotions was not an exception .",
    "the semantic differential approach originally proposed by osgood et al .",
    "@xcite considers three dimensions to characterize the person s personality .",
    "these dimensions are evalution , activity and potency .",
    "this approach was further tested from the point of view of emotions .",
    "russel and mehrabian @xcite proved in their study that the entire spectra of emotions can be described by the 3-dimensional space spanned by pleasure ( evaluation ) , arousal ( activity ) and domination ( potency ) axes .",
    "for every dimension , the lower and upper bounds ( ends ) are recognized as negative and positive poles , respectively .",
    "consequently , the negative pole can be described by negative adjectives , and positive one by positive adjectives .",
    "it was shown by russel and mehrabian @xcite that these three dimensions are not only necessary dimensions for an adequate description of emotions , but they are also sufficient to define all the various emotional states .",
    "in other words , the _ emotional state _ can be considered as a function of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "on the basis of this study , mehrabian @xcite proposed pleasure - arousal - dominance ( pad ) model of emotional scales .",
    "the emotional states defined as combinations of ends from various dimensions are presented in fig .",
    "[ pad ] .    in this study",
    ", we discuss the matter of how the pad model can be used in reflexive game theory ( rgt ) @xcite to emotionally color the interactions between people and humans and robots .",
    "the most important issue to fuse rgt inference and pad emotional scale is to build the bridge between two approaches .    by definition , pad model is spanned by three dimensions .",
    "the value of each component continuously ranges from -1 to 1 .",
    "the notation in the pad model space presented in fig .",
    "[ pad ] are as follows : 1 ) pair @xmath4 vs @xmath5 corresponds to @xmath1 ( positive pole : value 1 ) vs @xmath6 ( negative pole : value -1 ) ; 2 ) pair @xmath7 vs @xmath8 corresponds to @xmath2 ( positive pole : value 1 ) vs @xmath9-@xmath10 ( negative pole : value -1 ) ; and 3 ) pair @xmath11 vs @xmath12 corresponds to @xmath3 ( positive pole : value 1 ) vs @xmath13 ( negative pole : value -1 ) .",
    "accodring to mehrabian @xcite ,  pleasure vs displeasure \" distinguishes the positive vs negative emotional states , ",
    "arousal vs non - arousal \" refers to combination of physical activity and mental alertness , and ",
    "dominance vs submissiveness \" is defined in terms of control vs lack of control @xcite .",
    "though , pad model operates with continous values , i.e. , for example , @xmath14 is coded as @xmath15 .",
    "mehrabian @xcite defines 8 basic states , which are all possible combinations of high vs low pleasure ( @xmath4 vs @xmath5 ) , high vs low arousal ( @xmath7 vs @xmath8 ) , and high vs low dominance ( @xmath11 vs @xmath12 ) . in other words , there 8 basic states are all possiblecombinations of the poles . in total , there are 6 poles - two for each of three scales .",
    "therefore , there are @xmath16 possible combinations of poles .",
    "these states ( combinations ) are considered as extreme states and can be refered as approximations of the intermediate states .",
    "for instance , intermediate state  angry \" ( -0.51 , 0.59 , 0.25 ) can be approximated by extreme state  hostile \" @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , only eight extreme states can be used to describe the entire variety of intermediate emotional states .            ' '' ''    0&0&0 +    ' '' ''    1&0&1 +    ' '' ''    0&1&1 +    ' '' ''    1&1&1 +    [ dis ]        ' '' ''    0&0&0 +    ' '' ''    1&0&0 +    ' '' ''    0&1&0 +    ' '' ''    1&1&1 +    [ con ]    the combinations of poles in the pad space can be presented as 3-dimensional binary vectors , where 1 corresponds to positive pole ( 1 in pad notation ) and 0 refers to negative pole ( -1 in pad notation ) .",
    "therefore , emotional states , which are combinations of different poles of various dimensions , can be represented as follows : for instance , emotional state _ hostile ( -p,+a,+d ) or ( -1,1,1 ) _ can be substituted for @xmath18 , while _ relaxed ( + p ,-",
    "a,+d ) or ( 1,-1,1 ) _ can be represented as @xmath19 in the rescaled coordinates .",

    "the idea behind is as follows .",
    "two subjects being in alliance can find the compromise or a common influence , therefore their interaction can be characterized as conjunction of their influences . at the same time , two conflicting subjects will never reach a compromise and their interaction should include both influences . therefore disjunction operation corresponds to the conflict relationship .",

    "the emotional research based on pad model is transparent and clear .",
    "the models of robots exhibiting human like emotional behavior using only pad has been successfully illustrated in recent book by nishida et al . @xcite .",
    "the ability to influence the factors ( variables ) is the major justification for such approaches and for the application of the rgt .",

    "emotions shoud be regarded as highly automatics processing algorithms responsible for our everyday life survival .",
    "being entire unconscious ( automatic ) regulators of the human body s physiology , emotions bring the instantenous solutions of how to act in front of rapidly approaching possible threat .",

    "<S> this study addresses the matter of reflexive control of the emotional states by means of reflexive game theory ( rgt ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown how to build a bridge between rgt and emotions . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose the pleasure - arousal - dominance ( pad ) model is adopted . </S>",
    "<S> the major advantages of rgt are its ability to predict human behavior and unfold the entire spectra of reflexion in the human mind . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , pad provides ultimate approach to model emotions . </S>",
    "<S> it is illustrated that emotions are reflexive processes and , consequently , rgt fused with pad model is natural solution to model emotional interactions between people . </S>",
    "<S> the fusion of rgt and pad , called emotional reflexive games ( erg ) , inherits the key features of both components . using erg , </S>",
    "<S> we show how reflexive control can be successfully applied to model human emotional states . up to date </S>",
    "<S> , egr is a unique methodology capable of modeling human reflexive processes and emotional aspects simultaneously . </S>"
