    "respiration is a fundamental physiological activity @xcite and is associated with several muscular , neural and chemical processes within the body of living organisms .",
    "given the fact that respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , asthma , tuberculosis , sleep apnea and respiratory tract infections account for about 18% of human deaths worldwide @xcite , assessment of multiple respiratory parameters is of major importance for diagnosis and monitoring .",
    "accordingly , respiratory parameters such as respiration rate ( rr ) , respiration pattern ( rp ) and respiratory flow - volume are routinely measured in clinical and primary healthcare settings .",
    "rr refers to the number of inhalation - exhalation cycles ( breaths ) observed per unit time , usually quantified as breaths per minute ( bpm ) .",
    "rp refers to a temporal waveform signifying multiple phases of the respiratory function such as intervals and peaks of inhalation and exhalation , relative amplitudes of different breath cycles and cycle frequency ( instantaneous rr ) .",
    "respiratory flow - volume measures the amount of air that is inhaled / exhaled in every breath .",
    "a simple application of rr measurement is in assessing whether a human is breathing or not .",
    "apart from this , deviation from the permissible rr range ( usually 6 - 35 breaths per minute in healthy adults ) signifies pulmonary and cardiac abnormalities @xcite .",
    "for example , abnormally high rr is symptomatic of diseases like pneumonia in children .",
    "further , estimation of rp has several applications such as detection of sleep apnea , gating signal generation @xcite for medical imaging and psychological state assessment .",
    "sleep apnea is characterized by disrupted breathing patterns ( cessation , shallowing , flow - blockage ) during sleep which can be detected if a reliable estimate of rp is available .",
    "rp is used in respiration gated image acquisition , where radiographic images of human anatomical regions are captured synchronously with certain significant points of the rp ( for instance , an image is acquired at every inspiration peak ) to facilitate accurate image registration and minimize exposure to harmful x - rays .",
    "a similar technique is used in therapeutic energy delivery methods such as lithotripsy where shock waves are administered to posterior lower back region at certain temporal triggers of the rp .",
    "further , different rps indicate different sympathetic and parasympathetic responses leading to potential analysis of human emotions such as anger and stress .    given their aforementioned significance , accurate estimation of rp and rr has been considered an important problem in the biomedical engineering community for decades .",
    "several accurate and robust techniques such as spirometry @xcite , impedance pneumography @xcite and plethysmography @xcite can measure rr and some can also estimate rp . however , they employ contact - based leads , straps and probes which may not be optimal for use in situations such as neonatal icu , home health monitoring and gated image acquisition .",
    "this is due to several reasons such as sensitive skin , discomfort or irritation and interference of leads with the radiographic images acquired .",
    "owing to such needs , a recent trend in non - contact respiratory monitoring has emerged . in the following section , a brief review of non - contact methods for respiratory monitoring is provided .",
    "existing methods for non - contact rp estimation fall into one of the three categories - ( i ) estimation through indirect nasal air flow measurement , ( ii ) estimation by imaging volumetric changes in blood using remote photoplethysmography , and ( iii ) estimation by measurement of motion induced due to respiration . in the first category",
    ", the idea is to indirectly measure the amount of air inhaled and exhaled during each cycle using different modalities .",
    "one technique is phonospirometry @xcite , where the respiratory parameters are estimated from measurements of tracheal breath sounds captured using acoustic microphones placed near the trachea . based on the observation that the air exhaled has a higher temperature than the typical background of indoor environments , there are attempts to measure breathing function using highly sensitive infrared imaging @xcite .",
    "these two methods demand sensitive microphones and thermal imaging systems as additional hardware .",
    "also , it has been noted that subtle breathing is hard to measure using phonospirometry .",
    "the second category of algorithms are based on the observation that respiration information rides over the photoplethesmogram ( ppg ) signal as an amplitude modulation component .",
    "a gamut of recent works concentrate on camera - based ppg estimation @xcite .",
    "the basic idea in all these is to capture the subtle changes in skin color occurring from pulsatile changes in arterial blood volume in human body tissues .",
    "it is well recognized that these methods ( often called remote ppg or rppg ) are highly sensitive to subject motion , skin color and ambient light .",
    "a lot of effort has been put in improving the robustness of rppg against these artifacts and significant progress has been made using several signal processing and statistical modeling techniques including blind source separation @xcite , alternative reflectance models , spatial pruning @xcite , temporal filtering @xcite and autoregressive modeling @xcite . these methods albeit mature can only provide an estimate of rr but can not estimate rp .",
    "further , in some cases , they require a careful selection of a region of interest ( often facial region ) for processing .",
    "the third category of methods rely on measuring the motion induced in different body parts due to respiration .",
    "one proposed method @xcite is to use an ultrasonic proximity sensor ( typically mounted on a stand placed in front of the subject ) to measure the chest - wall motion induced by respiration .",
    "techniques based on ( a ) laser diodes measuring the distance between the chest wall and the sensor @xcite and ( b ) doppler radar system measuring the doppler shift in the transmitted waves induced by respiratory chest wall motion @xcite are also proposed .",
    "these methods demand dedicated sensors and in some cases have been reported to depend on the texture of the cloth on the subject . some methods",
    "@xcite employ depth sensing cameras ( such as kinect ) @xcite to directly measure the variations in the distance between a fixed surface ( such as wall ) and the chest - wall .",
    "there have been few attempts in estimating the rp using consumer grade 2d cameras : an attempt has been made by shao _",
    "@xcite , where the upward and downward motion in the shoulders due to the respiration is measured using differential signal processing , which is highly sensitive to the selection of region of interest ( roi ) comprising the shoulder region .",
    "very recently , use of haar - like features derived from optical flow vectors computed on the chest region is proposed to estimate rr @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposes an automatic roi selection method for rp estimation based on the observation that the respiration - induced chest - wall motion is uncorrelated from the remaining sources .",
    "the idea is to extract the dense optical flow vectors in the entire scene followed by a robust feature representation exploiting the intrinsic properties of respiration .",
    "these features are then factorized to get the respiration signal .",
    "one of our recent techniques also falls into this category @xcite .",
    "these methods are shown to be accurate and robust , however , they require computation of optical flow field for multiple frames which is known to be computationally expensive . in this paper , we propose a method to estimate the respiration pattern and rate using a consumer grade 2d camera .",
    "the method is computationally inexpensive and does not critically depend on the texture of the cloth , angle of view of the camera and selection of roi .",
    "suppose a consumer grade camera is placed in front of a steady human subject such that its field - of - view comprises the abdominal - thoracic region of the subject .",
    "assume that the relative position of the camera with respect to the subject does not change and also that the luminance of the background lighting is fairly constant .",
    "under such conditions , if a subject s abdominal - thoracic region is imaged using a video during breathing , the changes in each pixel value measured will be a function of the motion induced by respiration and the surface reflectance characteristics of the region imaged .",
    "since each pixel response is distinct , the core problem of rp estimation can be posed as the following : _ how to process individual pixel responses to obtain the respiratory pattern ? _    this problem is solved by modeling every pixel as the output of a linear time invariant ( lti ) channel of unknown system response driven by a hypothetical generating respiration signal that is to be estimated . the problem of estimation of rp is cast as the following estimation problem : estimate the input signal , given the outputs of several independent noise - corrupted lti channels with unknown system responses that are driven by the same generating input signal .",
    "this is referred to as the blind deconvolution problem of the single - input multiple - output ( simo ) systems in the signal processing community which is often solved through an assumed parametric form for the input signal and/or the system responses followed by error minimization techniques defined on different cost functions @xcite . however , in this paper , we propose a solution for blind deconvolution of periodic signals with a certain class of system characteristics where we neither assume any form for the transfer functions of the individual systems nor rely on error minimization .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , each pixel in the scene is modeled as response of a bibo stable , minimum phase lti measurement channel with unknown dynamics .",
    "each lti channel is assumed to be corrupted by an uncorrelated additive noise with an unknown distribution .",
    "no additional inter - relationship assumptions are required to be made based on geographic proximity between channels although in reality stronger correlation is expected between spatially proximal pixels .",
    "note that the spectral characteristics of the noise is scene specific and hence no distributional assumption is made .",
    "+ we term the periodic physical movements of the chest region caused by flow of air into and out of the respiratory system as the generating signal , a correlate of which ( rp ) we wish to estimate using a video stream from a 2d camera consisting of @xmath0x@xmath1 pixels in each frame . let the generating signal be denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "let the recorded pixel intensity at @xmath3 pixel , at a time @xmath4 be @xmath5 and the transfer function of the lti channel associated with that pixel be @xmath6 . the noise process associated with that channel shall be denoted by @xmath7 , with zero mean .",

    "that is , estimate @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "this is intractable in general since no information regarding the transfer functions of the lti systems is available .",
    "however , we show that a recovery of @xmath18 is possible if certain assumptions are made about the characteristics of @xmath2 . specifically ,",
    "if @xmath2 is periodic , we show in the subsequent sections that it is possible to recover @xmath18 . to start with",

    "such an ensemble averaging will also reduce the additive noise in the responses .",
    "although the existence of such a set can not be guaranteed for every problem , it can be empirically argued that such a set is very likely to exist for the cases considered in the current problem of rp estimation .",
    "the rest of this section describes a method for determining the set @xmath28 from a given large set of lti channel responses .",
    "finding @xmath28 through a brute - force method ( using its definition ) is not feasible because computing phase difference between two signals corrupted with noise is non - trivial .",
    "this is because the phase lag introduced by each lti channel and its associated noise level are unknown .",
    "hence , in this section , we describe an effective method that would not only serve to estimate g(t ) by choosing @xmath28 , but also aids in noise reduction .    it was seen in the previous section that the responses of random lti channels to a pure tone excitation signal results in a set of randomly scaled and shifted sinusoids ( see @xmath5 ) , which have two degrees of freedom namely random amplitude scale and phase shift .",
    "intuitively , such a set of random sinusoids can be mapped isomorphically to a two - dimensional space in which the arbitrary amplitude and the phase - lag are better represented .",

    "however , with noise , inclusion of points that are interior on the disk will distort the morphology of the estimated generating signal by violating condition 3 .",
    "hence , we propose to select the channels by aggregating along half elliptical arcs starting from the periphery .",

    "although this requirement seems to demand a crucial parameter a priori , it will be shown in the subsequent sections that the inaccuracy in the initial choice of @xmath43 does not affect the estimate of the rp .",
    "further , the exact state of the breathing of the subject at the start of the video capture is unknown .",
    "this results in a residual phase - lag between the estimated signal and the generating signal which is to be compensated for .",

    "the residual phase correction is made by projecting one period of the proxy signal on to the data elliptical disk .",
    "further the major axis of the data elliptical disk is reoriented along the direction of the projected point corresponding to the proxy signal .      in section ii.f , to handle the trade - off between estimating the higher harmonics better and reducing the impact of noise , a goe measure is described to select the parameter deciding the part of the disk to be included in @xmath28 . since the generating signal to be estimated is periodic a measure that quantifies the closeness of a signal to this behaviour will serve as a goe measure .",
    "it is known that the fourier magnitude spectrum of a periodic signal is sparse and @xmath174 norm ( number of non - zero elements in a set ) of the magnitude spectrum of periodic signals should be lower than that for non - periodic signals .",
    "hence , for aggregation of points to be chosen in @xmath28 , we start from the periphery and choose the parameter ( radius of exclusion , see ii.f . ) that would result in the least @xmath174 norm .",

    "this implies that the peak of the magnitude spectrum of the estimated signals is totally insensitive to the choice of basis - frequency and the lower cross - correlation is due to the aggregation of wrong phase lags @xmath185 ) of the lti channels that are selected in @xmath28 .",
