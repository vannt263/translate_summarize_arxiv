    "the eigenvalue spectrum of the dirac operator is a fundamental quantity in qcd .",
    "it reflects important properties induced by the gauge field .",
    "in particular , zero modes of the dirac operator have special roles on nonperturbative properties of qcd .",
    "the number of zero modes determines the topological charge @xmath0 of the background gauge field , as @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the numbers of right - handed and left - handed zero modes , respectively @xcite . also",
    ", the existence of zero modes is related to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , through the banks - casher relation , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the macroscopic spectral density of zero modes and @xmath6 is the absolute value of the chiral condensate @xcite .",
    "moreover , interestingly , the low - lying dirac spectrum shows the universal behavior of disordered systems .",
    "such an universal behavior is successfully described by chiral random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the low - lying dirac spectrum depends only on the global symmetries of the system , and not on the details of the microscopic structure .",
    "once the validity of chiral random matrix theory is guaranteed , chiral random matrix theory enables us to predict the low - lying eigenvalue distribution by a simple and universal function .",
    "it is definitely important to clarify how the gauge field induces these properties of the dirac spectrum .",
    "however , it is rather difficult .",
    "these properties are beyond the reach of perturbation theory .",
    "although the dirac equation is written in a simple form , the low - energy dirac spectrum is not easily obtained because of the complicated dynamics of the gauge field . in chiral random matrix theory ,",
    "the information about the dynamics of the gauge field is lost .",
    "the aim of this study is to investigate the relation between the dirac spectrum and the gauge field in lattice qcd .",
    "we focus on two kinds of components of the gauge field : momentum components and subgroup components .",
    "we decompose the gauge field into some components , and then calculate the dirac spectrum from the decomposed components . from the change of the dirac spectrum , we analyze how the components of the gauge field are related to the dirac spectrum .",
    "although such a decomposition is gauge dependent , we can intuitively understand the role of the gauge field from this analysis .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the staggered dirac spectrum in lattice qcd .",
    "the basics of the staggered dirac spectrum and the details of the numerical simulations are shown in section 2 .",
    "for the analysis of momentum components , we introduce a lattice framework of momentum cutoff in section 3 .",
    "we discuss the resultant dirac spectrum and the connection with chiral random matrix theory . for the analysis of subgroup components ,",
    "we project the su(3 ) gauge field onto an su(2 ) subgroup component , as demonstrated in section 4 .",
    "finally , section 5 is devoted to the summary .",
    "the euclidean dirac operator is defined as @xmath7.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath8-th eigenmode of the dirac operator is given by @xmath9 the chirality is defined as @xmath10 in continuum qcd , the anti - commutation relation , @xmath11 is satisfied . because the dirac operator is anti - hermitian , @xmath12 is zero or nonzero real .",
    "nonzero eigenvalues are always paired as @xmath13 and their chiralities are zero . on the other hand , zero eigenvalues",
    "are unpaired , and their chiralities are @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "the staggered dirac operator is @xmath16 , \\label{eqdst}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the standard staggered phase factor . for the standard ( unimproved ) staggered dirac operator ,",
    "@xmath18 is the su(3 ) link variable @xmath19 . for the improved staggered dirac operator ,",
    "@xmath18 is a combination of the link variables .",
    "the staggered fermion describes the four - flavor dirac fermion in continuum limit . at finite lattice spacing",
    ", however , there is an @xmath20 term which violates the flavor symmetry and eq .",
    "( [ eqac ] ) . due to the presence of this term ,",
    "the staggered dirac spectrum does not have exact zero eigenvalues , unlike the continuum dirac spectrum . as a result",
    ", the unimproved staggered dirac operator fails to reproduce nontrivial topological sectors @xcite .",
    "this problem is approximately settled by improving the gauge and fermion actions @xcite .",
    "we computed the low - lying eigenvalues of the staggered dirac operator by su(3 ) quenched lattice qcd simulations @xcite .",
    "we used the improved gauge action and the improved staggered dirac operator .",
    ".[tab1 ] the parameters of quenched gauge configurations .",
    "the lattice coupling @xmath21 , the corresponding lattice spacing @xmath22 , the lattice volume @xmath23 , and the configuration number @xmath24 are listed . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the scatter plot of the eigenvalue @xmath12 and the absolute value of the chirality @xmath25 of the su(2)-projected gauge field .",
    "the low - lying 20 eigenvalues of 50 gauge configurations are plotted .",
    "the calculation is done on the @xmath26 lattice with @xmath27 . ]     the lowest eigenvalue distribution of the su(2)-projected gauge field in the @xmath28 sector .",
    "the solid and dashed curves are eqs .",
    "( [ eqpsu2 ] ) and ( [ eqp ] ) , respectively . ]",
    "the low - lying dirac spectrum depends on the symmetry of the fermion field @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalue distributions are completely different between su(3 ) and su(2 ) . for the staggered dirac operator with the su(2 )",
    "quenched gauge field , chiral random matrix theory predicts that the lowest eigenvalue distribution is @xmath29 in the @xmath28 sector @xcite .",
    "this distribution is indeed obtained in su(2 ) lattice qcd @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , we show the lattice data of the su(2)-projected gauge field .",
    "the solid and dashed curves are the predictions of chiral random matrix theory for su(2 ) and su(3 ) , i.e. , eqs .",
    "( [ eqpsu2 ] ) and ( [ eqp ] ) , respectively .",
    "the lattice data is reproduced by the prediction for su(2 ) , not for su(3 ) .",
    "therefore , the su(2 ) subgroup component of the su(3 ) gauge theory shows the same universal behavior as the su(2 ) gauge theory .",
    "the best - fit value of the chiral condensate is @xmath30 .",
    "the ratio of this su(2)-projected chiral condensate to the original su(3 ) chiral condensate is 0.6 , which is roughly understood as the ratio of the numbers of color .",
    "we investigated the relation between the dirac spectrum and components of the gauge field .",
    "we considered momentum components and a subgroup component of the gauge group .",
    "as for momentum components of the gauge field , the dirac zero mode and the topological charge are gradually destroyed by the ultraviolet or infrared cutoff .",
    "the low - momentum component is especially crucial for the validity of chiral random matrix theory . as for an su(2 ) subgroup component of the su(3 ) gauge group , it behaves like the su(2 ) gauge field .",
    "the relation between zero modes and the gauge field is relevant for the topological structure of qcd vacuum , e.g. , the topological charge density distribution",
    ". it would be instructive to perform the similar analysis with the overlap operator .",
