    "thermal convection in a rotating spherical fluid shell represents one of the fundamental systems on which a considerable part of the understanding of many observed geophysical , planetary and astrophysical phenomena is based .",
    "it is generally believed that the magnetic field exhibited by celestial bodies is generated in their interiors by convection driven by thermal and compositional buoyancy .",
    "cloud patterns and the differential rotation seen at the surface of the major planets are likely to be connected with convection in the deep atmospheres of those planets ( busse , 1976 , 1994 ) .",
    "considerable attention has therefore been devoted to the study of dynamical properties of rotating spherical shells . for recent reviews we refer to the papers by zhang and busse ( 1998 ) and busse ( 2002 ) .    because a radially directed buoyancy force can not be easily realized in earth - bound laboratories , experimenters had to resort to the use of centrifugal accelerations ( busse and carrigan , 1976 ) or use spacecrafts for their experiments ( hart _ et al .",
    "fortunately , it has turned out that the component of gravity perpendicular to the axis of rotation is much more important than the component parallel to it .",
    "the centrifugal force is thus a convenient substitute since through the reversal of the applied temperature gradient the same buoyancy can be obtained as for the inward directed component of gravity perpendicular to the axis .",
    "moreover , the centrifugal force increases with the distance from the axis just as the case of the gravity field of a spherical body of constant density . the use of electric fields ( hart _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 ) or magnetic fields with ferrofluids ( rosenzweig _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) leads to rather different radial dependences of the effective gravity .",
    "it must be admitted , however , that the absence of an axial component of gravity in experiments employing the centrifugal force leads to a thermal wind type flow in the basic state . but this can be minimized when the coriolis parameter is sufficiently large or when a thin spherical shell is used as for example in the experimental realization of convection shown in figure [ f1 ] .    in this",
    "paper results from a numerical study will be reported that have been obtained with essentially the same computer code as employed in earlier studies focusing on turbulent convection ( tilgner and busse , 1997 ) and on the generation of magnetic fields ( grote and busse , 2001 ) . the mathematical formulation and the description of the numerical method given in section 2",
    "can thus be kept brief . in section 3 a short introduction to the results of linear theory for the onset of convection",
    "will be given . in section 4",
    "properties of columnar convection at prandtl numbers of the order unity will be described and some animations of the time dependence will be presented .",
    "equatorially attached convection flows are the subject of section 5 .",
    "their properties at finite amplitudes are studied here for the first time .",
    "because of the required high numerical resolution in time as well as in space the low prandtl number regime of fully nonlinear convection has posed a significant computational challenge until now .",
    "as will be shown the continuity of the convection heat flux requires that equatorially attached convection must be joined by columnar convection as the rayleigh number increases significantly above its critical value . a concluding discussion will be given in section 6 .",
    "for the description of finite amplitude convection in rotating spherical fluid shells we follow the standard formulation used by many authors zhang and busse(1987 ) , ardes _",
    "( 1997 ) , zhang(1991 , 1992 ) .",
    "it is assumed that a general static state exists with the temperature distribution @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the ratio of inner to outer radius of the shell and @xmath2 is its thickness .",
    "@xmath3 is the temperature difference between the boundaries in the special case @xmath4 of vanishing internal heat sources .",
    "the gravity field is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the position vector with respect to the center of the sphere and @xmath7 is its length measured in units of @xmath2 .",
    "in addition to the length @xmath2 , the time @xmath8 and the temperature @xmath9 are used as scales for the dimensionless description of the problem where @xmath10 denotes the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and @xmath11 its thermal diffusivity .",
    "the density is assumed to be constant except in the gravity term where its temperature dependence given by @xmath12 const .",
    "is taken into account .",
    "the basic equations of motion and the heat equation for the deviation @xmath13 from the static temperature distribution are thus given by    @xmath14    @xmath15    @xmath16    where the rayleigh numbers @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the coriolis parameter @xmath19 and the prandtl number @xmath20 are defined by    @xmath21    since the velocity field @xmath22 is solenoidal the general representation in terms of poloidal and toroidal components can be used , @xmath23 by multiplying the ( curl)@xmath24 and the curl of equation ( [ 1a ] ) by @xmath6 we obtain two equations for @xmath25 and @xmath26 ,    @xmath27 \\nabla^2 v + \\tau q w - l_2 \\theta   = - { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } } \\cdot \\nabla \\times [ \\nabla \\times ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ u$ } } \\cdot \\nabla { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ u$ } } ) ] \\ ] ]    @xmath28 w - \\tau qv = { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } } \\cdot \\nabla \\times ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ u$ } } \\cdot \\nabla { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ u$}})\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the partial derivatives with respect to time @xmath31 and with respect to the angle @xmath32 of a spherical system of coordinates @xmath33 and where the operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 are defined by    @xmath36    @xmath37    stress - free boundaries with fixed temperatures are most often assumed , @xmath38 @xmath39 but sometimes no - slip boundaries are used in which case the conditions @xmath40 must be replaced by @xmath41 . for simplicity we shall assume the previously used value @xmath42 unless indicated otherwise .",
    "the numerical integration of equations ( [ 1c ] ) and ( 2 ) together with boundary conditions ( [ 4 ] ) proceeds with the pseudo - spectral method which is based on an expansion of all dependent variables in spherical harmonics for the @xmath43-dependences , i.e. @xmath44 and analogous expressions for the other variables , @xmath26 and @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath45 denotes the associated legendre functions . for",
    "the @xmath7-dependence expansions in chebychev polynomials are used .",
    "spherical harmonics up to the order of @xmath46 and up to 41 collocation points in radial direction have been used .",
    "a time step as low as @xmath47 was required for the computations of the small prandtl number cases reported in section 5 . for further details",
    "see busse _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) , tilgner and busse ( 1997 ) .",
    "benchmark comparisons for stationary solutions of equations ( [ 1c ] ) and ( 2 ) together with conditions ( [ 4 ] ) when the dynamo process is included have been done in the past ( christensen _ et al . _ ,",
    "a rough idea of the dependence of the critical rayleigh number @xmath48 on the parameters of the problem in the case of internal heating can be gained from the expressions derived from the annulus model ( busse , 1970 )    @xmath49    @xmath50    @xmath51    where @xmath52 refers to the mean radius of the fluid shell , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 to the corresponding colatitude , @xmath55 arcsin@xmath56 .",
    "the azimuthal wavenumber of the preferred mode is denoted by @xmath57 and the corresponding angular velocity of the drift of the convection columns in the prograde direction is given by @xmath58 . in figure [ f2 ]",
    "the expressions ( [ 6a ] , [ 6c ] ) are compared with accurate numerical values which indicate that the general trend is well represented by expressions ( [ 6a ] , [ 6c ] ) .",
    "the same property holds for @xmath57 . for a rigorous asymptotic analysis including the radial dependence we refer to jones _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) . in the following",
    "we shall continue to restrict the attention to the case @xmath59 and thus we shall drop the subscript @xmath60 of @xmath17 .",
    "there is a second mode of convection which becomes preferred at onset for sufficiently low prandtl numbers .",
    "it is characterized by convection cells attached to the equatorial part of the outer boundary not unlike the `` banana cells '' seen in the narrow gap experiment of figure [ f1 ] .",
    "the equatorially attached mode actually represents an inertial wave modified by the effects of viscous dissipation and thermal buoyancy .",
    "an analytical description of this type of convection can thus be attained through the introduction of viscous friction and buoyancy as perturbations as has been done by zhang ( 1994 ) for the case of stress - free as well as for no - slip boundaries ( zhang , 1995 ) . according to ardes _",
    "( 1997 ) equatorially attached convection is preferred at onset for @xmath61 where @xmath62 increases in proportion to @xmath63 .    in the derivation of the asymptotic relationships ( 6 ) the exact nature of the boundary condition for the tangential component of the velocity vector at the spherical surface does not enter . in the limit of infinite @xmath19",
    "the conditions of onset of convections are the same for no - slip and for stress - free conditions . in the following",
    "we shall restrict the attention , however , to the case of stress - free boundaries in order to avoid the complications arising from ekman boundary layers at no - slip surfaces .",
    "in general the onset of convection in rotating fluid spheres occurs supercritically .",
    "as long as the convection assumes the form of shape preserving travelling thermal rossby waves as described by linear theory , its azimuthally averaged properties are time independent . in fact , as seen from a frame of reference drifting together with the convection columns the entire pattern is steady .",
    "a differential rotation is generated through the action of the reynolds stress .",
    "the latter is caused by the spiralling cross section of the columns which persists as a dominant feature at moderate prandtl numbers far into the turbulent regime .",
    "the plots of the streamlines @xmath64 in the equatorial plane shown in figure [ f3 ] give a good impression of the spiralling nature of the columns .",
    "a true time dependence of convection develops in the form of vacillations after a subsequent bifurcation .",
    "first the transition to amplitude vacillations occurs in which case just the amplitude of convection varies periodically in time as exhibited in the left plot of figure [ f3 ] . at a somewhat higher rayleigh number shape vacillations",
    "become noticeable which are characterized by periodic changes in the structure of the columns as shown in the right plot of figure [ f3 ] .",
    "the outer part of the columns is stretched out , breaks off and decays .",
    "the thinning and subsequent breakup can actually be best seen in movie 1 .",
    "the tendency towards breakup is caused by the fact that the local frequency of propagation varies with distance from the axis according to expression ( 6c ) after @xmath54 has been replaced by the local colatitude @xmath65 .",
    "+ movies 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "the two types of vacillations also differ significantly in their frequencies of oscillation .",
    "this is evident from the time records of the energy densities of convection which have been plotted in figure [ f4 ] .",
    "the various components of the energy densities are defined by @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 refers to the azimuthally averaged component of @xmath25 and @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 .    as the rayleigh number",
    "is increased further a fairly sudden transition into a chaotic regime occurs where convection has become strongly inhomogeneous in space and in time .",
    "a typical sequence of plots is shown in figure 5 which covers about one period of the the relaxation cycles seen in the time record for @xmath71 in figure [ f4 ] .",
    "in contrast to the more common relaxation oscillations encountered at higher rayleigh numbers , see , for example , the time record for @xmath72 in figure [ f4 ] , convection does not die off entirely at any time during the cycle .",
    "but the interaction between convection and differential rotation appears to be similar .",
    "as the amplitude of convection as measured by @xmath73 and @xmath74 grows the differential rotation generated by the reynolds stress grows as well with just a small delay in time .",
    "when the differential rotation reaches a critical level the convection columns become disrupted and their amplitude decays .",
    "subsequently the differential rotation decays as well on the time scale of viscous diffusion .",
    "it is typical for this type of relaxation cycles that the viscous decay is shorter than the growth time of the differential rotation in contrast to the relaxation oscillations at higher values of @xmath75 .",
    "the regime of relaxation oscillations is interrupted once in a while by a return to the more regular regime of shape vacillations as shown in the inserted enlargement of the time record for @xmath71 in figure [ f4 ] .",
    "but in contrast to the vacillation of the right plot figure [ f3 ] the pattern is now strongly modulated .",
    "the component with the azimuthal wavenumber m=1 plays a dominant role in this modulation .",
    "as can be seen in figure 6 the pattern recurs nearly periodically in time in spite of the modulation .",
    "figure 6 corresponds to the slightly higher rayleigh number of @xmath76 where convection changes intermittently between relaxation cycles and vacillation oscillations .    as @xmath75",
    "is further increased the spatio - temporal structure of convection becomes more irregular as can be seen in the time series for @xmath77 in figure [ f4 ] .",
    "but at @xmath72 the relaxation oscillations with only intermittent convection become firmly established and they continue to persist up to rayleigh numbers of the order of @xmath78 .",
    "they are basically the same phenomenon as found by grote and busse ( 2001 ) at @xmath79 and even the period is the same , about @xmath80 , which corresponds to the viscous decay time of the differential rotation .",
    "the only difference that can be noted is the small precursor hump before the burst of convection . in figure 7",
    "the third plot shows convection appearing in a fairly regular pattern .",
    "afterwards it decays again as shown in the fourth plot before it erupts in a chaotic fashion as the differential rotation has reached its minimum amplitude . since this latter part of the cycle occurs on a rather short time scale , smaller intervals between the plots",
    "have been used for this part in figure 7 .",
    "the main difference between convection at @xmath81 and prandtl numbers of the order unity occurs at the transition between regular and irregular patterns .",
    "a typical scenario is shown in figure 8 .",
    "after convection has set in in the form of eight drifting column pairs the usual amplitude vacillations occur as the rayleigh number is increased .",
    "the shape vacillations , however , exhibit a modulation with wavenumber @xmath82 as shown in figure 9 .",
    "only every second pair of columns gets stretched until the outer part separates , a little earlier for the cyclonic column than for the anticyclonic one .",
    "then the same process is repeated for the other pairs of columns such that the sequence shown in figure 9 exhibits only half a period of the oscillation .",
    "in addition , of course , the column pattern drifts in the prograde direction .",
    "movie 2 provides a vivid impression of this type of convection .    with increasing rayleigh number",
    "the stretching process gets out of phase and an @xmath83-modulation enters as shown in figure 10 .",
    "the time dependence is still periodic , but has become more complex in that some of the separated outer parts become attached to the preceding column pair . to show this process in more detail some extra plots",
    "have been added to the time sequence of figure 10 .",
    "while the amplitude of convection varies considerably throughout the cycle , the differential rotation exhibits only small oscillations as can be seen from the corresponding section of figure 8 .    by the time when @xmath75 has reached @xmath84",
    "the modulated vacillations have become aperiodic and with increasing rayleigh number convection becomes more and more chaotic .",
    "regularity reappears only in the form relaxation oscillations as shown in the section for @xmath85 of figure 8 .",
    "remainders of the vacillations can still be seen in this time record .",
    "but at @xmath86 the relaxation oscillations have become fully established with convection occurring only in a intermittent fashion .",
    "although obtained for a slightly smaller value of @xmath19 , movie 3 gives a good impression of the onset of relaxation oscillations .",
    "since stellar interiors as well as metallic planetary cores are characterized by rather small prandtl numbers much attention has been focused on the problem of the onset of convection in rotating fluid spheres in the case of small @xmath20 .",
    "zhang and busse ( 1987 ) found the equatorially attached mode which is quite distinct from the columnar mode discussed in the preceding section .",
    "the new mode represents an inertial oscillation which becomes excited when viscous dissipation is balanced by the energy provided by thermal buoyancy .",
    "the fact that both energies can be regarded as small perturbations has led zhang ( 1994 , 1995 ) to solve the problem of onset of convection by an asymptotic analysis .",
    "an detailed numerical study together with some analytical approximations can be found in the paper of ardes _",
    "the results of these various efforts have turned out to be rather complex since the preferred inertial modes travel in the prograde as well in the retrograde directions depending on the parameters of the problem . moreover , the azimuthal wavenumber @xmath87 of convection does not increase monotonically with the coriolis parameter @xmath19 as is usually found for the columnar mode at values of @xmath20 of the order unity or higher .",
    "in addition to the simple `` single cell '' inertial modes of zhang and busse ( 1987 ) multicellular modes have been found in the study of ardes _",
    "( 1997 ) which appear to be closely related to the multicellular modes described by the airy function in the analysis by yano ( 1992 ) of the analogous problem of convection in the rotating cylindrical annulus .",
    "the numerical solutions for the problem obtained by pino _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) also indicate the onset of multicellular convection in parts of the parameter space .    here",
    "we shall present only some examples of the variety of patterns encountered in a rotating sphere of a low prandtl number fluid . in figure 11 the multiple changes from retrograde to prograde modes as a function of @xmath19",
    "are indicated and the corresponding changes in the patterns are shown in figure 12 . to facilitate comparisons the wavenumber",
    "@xmath88 has been kept fixed . but",
    "similar changes in the structure of convection are found when competing values of @xmath87 are admitted .",
    "the retrograde and prograde modes differ little in their form .",
    "the opposite phase between toroidal and poloidal components of motion is the most characteristic difference as indicated in figure 13 .",
    "the sense of outward spiralling is also opposite for prograde and retrograde modes as is evident from figure 12 .",
    "but in the limit of vanishing prandtl number the sense of spiralling disappears because the phase of the inertial modes does not vary with distance from the axis .    whenever @xmath19 is sufficiently large the frequency omega is closely approximated by the frequency of the corresponding inertial modes which is given by the analytical expression ( zhang , 1994 ; ardes _ et al .",
    "_ , 1997 ) , @xmath89^{\\frac{1}{2}}).\\ ] ]    the negative ( positive ) sign applies for modes drifting in the prograde ( retrograde ) direction .",
    "explicit values of expression ( 9 ) are given in figures 11 and 13 for comparisons with the numerically determined values .",
    "for an analysis of nonlinear properties of equatorially attached convection we focus on the case @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "the critical rayleigh number for this case is @xmath92 corresponding to @xmath93 .",
    "as r is increased beyond the critical value other values of @xmath87 from 7 to 12 can be realized , but @xmath93 and lower values are usually preferred .",
    "an asymptotic perfectly periodic solution with @xmath93 or @xmath94 can be found only for rayleigh numbers close to the critical value when computations are started from arbitrary initial conditions . on the other hand ,",
    "perfect periodic patterns appear to be stable with respect to small disturbances over a more extended regime of supercritical rayleigh numbers .",
    "distinct transitions like the transition to amplitude vacillations and to structure vacillations do not seem to exist for equatorially attached convection .",
    "instead modulated patterns are typically already observed when @xmath75 exceeds the critical value by 10% as can be seen in the plots of figure 15 .",
    "these modulations are basically caused by the interaction of two modes with neighboring values of the azimuthal wavenumber @xmath87 as indicated in figure 16 .",
    "here the region of small amplitude drifts in the retrograde direction with the difference of the drift rates for @xmath95 and @xmath88 .",
    "the time series of energy densities shown in figure 17 indicate that more than two modes usually contribute to the dynamics of the pattern since the time dependence is not periodic as one would expect if only two modes interact .",
    "the computations of the time series require a high spatial resolution together with a small time step .",
    "the time spans indicated in figure 17 are sufficient for reaching a statistically steady state of the fluctuating components of motion since these equilibrate on the fast thermal time scale of the order @xmath96 . only close to @xmath97",
    "the adjustment process takes longer as can be seen in the case @xmath98 where a @xmath93 - pattern approaches its equilibrium state .",
    "the pattern corresponding to the other cases of figure 17 are the ones shown in figures 15 , 16 and 18 .",
    "the differential rotation represented by @xmath99 relaxes on the viscous time scale and thus takes a long time to reach its asymptotic regime in the examples shown in figure 17 .",
    "but the differential rotation is quite weak such that it has a negligible effect on the other components of motion except in the case of the highest rayleigh number of figure 17 .",
    "even smaller is the axisymmetric part of the poloidal component of motion which is not shown in the plots of figure 17 . at higher rayleigh numbers the equatorially attached eddies spread farther into the interior and in some cases",
    "become detached from the equator as can be seen in the plots of figure 18 . in this way the convection eddies contribute to the heat transport from the inner boundary .",
    "but at the same time they acquire the properties of the convection columns which are characteristic for convection at higher prandtl numbers . accordingly",
    "the differential rotation is steeply increased at @xmath100 and a tendency towards relaxation oscillation can be noticed in the upper right time series of figure 17 .",
    "the results on linear and nonlinear properties of low prandtl number convection in rotating spherical shells are of special interest for applications to problems of convection in planetary and stellar interiors .",
    "since planetary cores often consist of liquid metal or of metallic hydrogen as in the case of jupiter and saturn , their prandtl numbers are rather low . moreover , because of high temperatures radiative heat transport is no longer negligible which tends to lower the prandtl number even more .",
    "the latter effect dominates in stellar interiors .",
    "on the other hand , turbulence owing to small scale motions which remain unresolved in numerical simulations will tend to equalize all effective diffusivities .",
    "but this tendency is not likely to erase entirely the differences in the subgrid scale transports of heat and momentum .    of particular interest",
    "is the effect of the prandtl number on the dynamo action of convection .",
    "while the strong differential rotation associated with columnar convection tends to promote the generation of magnetic fields ( see , for example , grote and busse , 2001 ) , its near absence in the case of equatorial attached convection may increase the rayleigh number required for dynamo action at a given value of the magnetic prandtl number . as the rayleigh number reaches high values more column like",
    "convection flows tend to appear near the inner boundary of the shell and are expected to promote dynamo action .",
    "numerical studies of this problem are in progress and will be reported in the near future .",
    "the regular and modulated patterns of convection reported in this paper as well as the coherent structures found in the chaotic regimes of convection can in principle be observed in experiments through the use of techniques mentioned in the introduction .",
    "low prandtl number fluids such as liquid metals pose severe experimental challenges because convection flows can not easily be visualized . on the other hand",
    "the temperature profiles of convection patterns can be measured through time records of thermistor probes implanted in the spherical boundary since the pattern is drifting by .",
    "see , for example , measurements of convection in mercury in the case of the cylindrical annulus by azouni _",
    "( 1986 ) and of convection in a spherical shell by cordero and busse ( 1992 ) .",
    "for the purpose of an eventual comparison with experimental observation the computations reported in this paper should be repeated for the case of no - slip boundaries with @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the computational effort will be more demanding but no significant qualitative changes are expected in that case .",
