    "this paper is motivated by the recent introduction of a series of arithmetic operators for fractal dimension of hyperhelices  @xcite by carlos d. toledo - surez  @xcite .",
    "let us briefly recall that a hyperhelix of order @xmath0 is defined to be a self - similar object consisting of a thin elastic rod wound into a helix , which is itself wound into a larger helix , until this process has been repeated @xmath0 times .",
    "a hyperhelix fractal results when @xmath0 tends to infinity .",
    "the hausdorff - besicovitch dimension of a hyperhelix fractal can be any desired number above unity .",
    "however , the interpretation of hyperhelices with fractal dimension larger than three , which unavoidably intersect themselves , is not obvious .",
    "in fact , this author is attempted to point out that geometrical considerations forbids hyperhelix fractal dimensions larger than three .",
    "this is the main inconvenient with the fractal dimension arithmetics introduced by toledo - surez  @xcite .",
    "could such drawbacks be circumvented by using another kind of fractal ?    this short paper introduces an algebraic structure for the fractal dimension of polyadic cantor fractals , resulting from iterative replacement of segments in the unit interval by scaled versions of them , whose hausdorff - besicovitch dimension can be any real number in the interval @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "the new arithmetic preserves this property avoiding the appearance of non - geometrically feasible fractal dimensions larger than unity .",
    "the contents of this paper are as follows .",
    "the next section recalls the characteristics of symmetrical , polyadic , cantor fractal sets .",
    "section  3 , presents the new arithmetical operators for the addition , subtraction , product , and division of the fractal dimension , summarizing their main properties .",
    "finally , the last section is devoted to the main conclusions .",
    "polyadic , or generalized , cantor sets are defined as follows  @xcite .",
    "the first step ( @xmath2 ) is to take a segment of unit length , referred to as the initiator . in the next step , @xmath3 ,",
    "the segment is replaced by @xmath0 non - overlapping copies of the initiator , each one scaled by a factor @xmath4 .",
    "for @xmath0 odd , as shown in fig .",
    "[ polyadiccantorset](a ) , one copy lies exactly centered in the interval , and the remaining ones are distributed such that @xmath5 copies are placed completely to the left of the interval and the remaining @xmath6 copies are placed wholly to its right , where @xmath6 is the greatest integer less than or equal to @xmath7 ; additionally , each copy among these @xmath8 ones is separated by a fixed distance , let us say @xmath9 . for @xmath0 even , as shown in fig .",
    "[ polyadiccantorset](b ) , one half of the copies is placed completely to the left of the interval and the other half completely to its right , with each copy separated by @xmath9 . at the following construction stages of the the fractal set , @xmath10",
    ", the generation process is repeated over and over again for each segment in the previous stage .",
    "strictly speaking , the cantor set is the limit of this procedure as @xmath11 , which is composed of geometric points distributed so that each point lies arbitrarily close of other points of the set , being the @xmath12-th stage cantor set usually referred to as a pre - fractal or physical fractal .     and @xmath13 ) of polyadic cantor fractal sets with @xmath14 ( a ) and @xmath15 ( b ) , showing the definition of both the scale factor ( @xmath16 ) and the lacunarity parameter ( @xmath9).,width=453 ]    symmetrical polyadic cantor fractals are characterized by three parameters , the number of self - similar copies @xmath0 , the scaling factor @xmath16 , and the width of the outermost gap at the first stage , @xmath9 , here on referred to as the lacunarity parameter , as in most of the previous technical papers dealing with polyadic cantor fractals in engineering applications  @xcite .",
    "the similarity dimension of all polyadic cantor fractals is @xmath17 , which is independent of the lacunarity parameter .",
    "the three parameters of a polyadic cantor set must satisfy certain constraints in order to avoid overlapping between the copies of the initiator .",
    "let us recall such almost obvious results for the sake of completeness .",
    "on the one hand , the maximum value of the scaling factor depends on the value of @xmath0 , such that @xmath18 . on the other hand , for each @xmath0 and @xmath16 , there are two extreme values for @xmath9 .",
    "the first one is @xmath19 , for which the highest lacunar fractal is obtained , i.e. , that with the largest possible gap . for @xmath0 even , the central gap has a width equal to @xmath20 , and , for @xmath0 odd , both large gaps surrounding the central well have a width of @xmath21 .",
    "the other extreme value is @xmath22 where for even ( odd ) @xmath0 two ( three ) wells are joined together in the center , without any gap in the central region .",
    "the width of the @xmath23 gaps in this case is equal to @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the corresponding lacunarity is lower than that for @xmath25 , but not the smallest one , which is obtained for the most regular distribution , where the gaps and wells have the same width at the first stage ( @xmath3 ) given by @xmath26 note that @xmath27 .",
    "let us take two @xmath0-adic cantor fractals @xmath28 and @xmath29 with scaling factors ( fractal dimensions ) @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , respectively .",
    "their fractal dimensions can be combined by means of the following four operators in order to obtain a new @xmath0-adic cantor fractal @xmath34 with scaling factor @xmath35 and fractal dimension @xmath36 .",
    "note that the independency of the similarity dimension on the lacunarity parameter avoids the need of its incorporation into the dimension arithmetic which follows .",
    "let us define the @xmath0-adic cantor fractal @xmath38 by means of @xmath39 , resulting in @xmath40 where , by abuse of notation , the operator @xmath37 has also been applied to the fractal dimensions of the fractals @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "there is no identity element @xmath51 for @xmath37 , such that @xmath52 , since the only possibility is to take @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which it is not a geometrically valid @xmath0-adic cantor fractal .",
