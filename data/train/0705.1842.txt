    "understanding the behavior of high energy hadron reactions from a fundamental perspective within quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is an important goal of particle physics .",
    "since it was observed that the total hadronic cross sections grow with the center of mass energy ( @xmath2 ) , much theoretical effort has been devoted to explain this growth .",
    "in particular , a qcd based explanation for this rising behavior was proposed by gaisser and halzen @xcite : the cross section would grow because partons would start to play a role in the hadronic reactions . at higher energies , lower values of the bjorken @xmath3 are accessible and the parton distributions ( especially the gluon distribution ) grow very rapidly leading to rising cross sections .",
    "the basic idea of this approach , called minijet model , is that the total cross section can be decomposed as follows ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) ) : @xmath4 where @xmath5 characterizes the nonperturbative contribution , which is in general taken as energy - independent at high energies @xcite , and @xmath6 is calculable in perturbative qcd with the use of an arbitrary cutoff at low transverse momenta @xmath7 .",
    "unfortunately , this approach implies a power - like energy behavior for the total cross section , violating the froissart bound , which is a consequence of the unitarity of the @xmath8 matrix and states that total cross sections can not grow faster than @xmath9 as @xmath10 .",
    "this bound is a well - established property of the strong interactions and puts a strict limit on the rate of growth with energy of the total cross sections . over the years several solutions",
    "have been proposed to cure the too fast growth found in the minijet model @xcite , most of them using the eikonal formalism @xcite .    in parallel with these developments",
    "the study of the high energy limit of the linear evolution equations ( dglap and bfkl ) @xcite revealed that they should be modified and gluon recombination effects ( consequence of the high density of gluons ) should be included in the qcd evolution @xcite .",
    "this expectation can be easily understood : while for large momentum transfer @xmath11 , the bfkl equation predicts that the mechanism @xmath12 populates the transverse space with a large number of small size gluons per unit of rapidity ( the transverse size of a gluon with momentum @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath13 ) , for small @xmath11 the produced gluons overlap and fusion processes , @xmath14 , are equally important .",
    "currently , one believes that the small-@xmath3 gluons in a hadron wave function should form a color glass condensate ( cgc ) which is described by an infinite hierarchy of coupled evolution equations for the correlators of wilson lines @xcite .",
    "this new state of matter is characterized by gluon saturation and by a typical momentum scale , the saturation scale @xmath0 , which grows with the energy and determines the critical line separating the linear and saturation regimes of the qcd dynamics .",
    "the saturation effects are small for @xmath15 and very strong for @xmath16 .",
    "experimentally , there are strong evidences of nonlinear ( saturation ) effects at desy - hera .",
    "in particular , the desy @xmath17 hera data in the small-@xmath3 and low-@xmath18 region can be successfully described in terms of saturation models @xcite , with the measured cross sections presenting the geometric scaling property @xcite , which is an intrinsic property of the cgc physics . moreover ,",
    "the cgc physics is able to describe quite well the @xmath19 rhic data ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "these results give strong support to the existence of a saturation regime in the qcd dynamics ( for recent reviews see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "is disregarded , the region @xmath20 is included in our model and its contribution to the total cross section increases when the energy rises.,title=\"fig : \" ] +   is disregarded , the region @xmath20 is included in our model and its contribution to the total cross section increases when the energy rises.,title=\"fig : \" ]    some attempts to reconcile the qcd parton picture with the froissart limit using saturation physics were proposed in recent years , but the question remains open @xcite . in this paper we propose a very simple phenomenological approach to treat this problem . in the next section we briefly describe the minijet model and how we include saturation effects in it . in the subsequent sections we present our numerical results and discuss them .",
    "in what follows we generalize the minijet model assuming the existence of the saturation regime in the high energy limit .",
    "more precisely , we assume the existence of a saturation window between the nonperturbative and perturbative regimes of qcd , which grows when the energy increases ( since @xmath0 grows with the energy ) .",
    "this window is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) .",
    "we now generalize eq .",
    "( [ sigsum1 ] ) introducing the saturation window : @xmath21 where the saturated component , @xmath22 , contains the dynamics of the interactions at scales lower than the saturation scale . in this region",
    "nonlinear effects are strong , changing the @xmath23 behavior of the differential cross section , which becomes much less singular in the low @xmath23 region , as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) .",
    "the simple qcd collinear factorization formulas do not in general apply in this region .      at high transverse momenta",
    "we keep using the same collinear factorization formula employed in @xcite with the necessary update of the parton densities .",
    "the saturation scale arises as a natural cut - off at low transverse momenta of the perturbative ( minijet ) cross section component , @xmath6 , which is now given by : _ pqcd= _",
    "q_s^2 dp_t^2 _ i ,",
    "j dx_1 dx_2 f_i(x_1,p_t^2 ) f_j(x_2,p_t^2 ) _ ij [ smjet ] where @xmath24 is the parton density of the species @xmath25 in the proton extracted from deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and @xmath26 is the leading order elementary parton - parton cross section . at very high energies",
    "the cross section ( [ smjet ] ) is dominated by gluon - gluon interactions . in what follows we use the mrst leading order parton distributions @xcite in our calculations of @xmath6 .",
    "similar results are obtained using for instance the cteq6-lo parton distribution sets @xcite .    in order to evaluate @xmath6",
    "we need to specify @xmath0 , which is determined by the solution of the nonlinear evolution equation associated to cgc physics @xcite .",
    "it is given by : q_s^2 ( x ) = q_0 ^ 2()^ [ qsgbw ] where @xmath3 is the bjorken variable , with @xmath27 gev@xmath28 and @xmath29 fixed by the initial condition .",
    "the saturation exponent @xmath30 has been estimated considering different approximations for the qcd dynamics , being @xmath31 at nlo accuracy @xcite , in agreement with the hera phenomenology , where the parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath30 were fixed by fitting the @xmath17 hera data @xcite .",
    "when we go from deep inelastic scattering to hadron - hadron collisions , there is some ambiguity in the definition of the equivalent of the bjorken @xmath3 .",
    "following @xcite we take @xmath3 to be x = [ xbj ] where @xmath34 is a momentum scale to be determined . from ( [ qsgbw ] ) and ( [ xbj ] )",
    "we immediately see that : q_s^2 ( s ) s^ [ qsats ] with the constant of proportionality being determined by hera data and our choice of @xmath34 .",
    "as it will be seen , in the high energy limit @xmath6 is the most important contribution to @xmath35 . with a constant infra - red cut - off , as in ( [ sigsum1 ] ) , it would grow too fast . the introduction of a cut - off increasing with energy",
    "can tame this growth , since the bulk of the integral in ( [ smjet ] ) comes from the low momentum region .",
    "this procedure was already employed , for example in @xcite , in a purely pragmatic approach .",
    "here we establish a connection between this cut - off and the energy behavior of @xmath0 , controlled by the parameter @xmath30 in ( [ qsats ] ) .",
    "our procedure is more physical and , at the same time , imposes restrictions on @xmath30 .      in order to calculate the total cross section we also need to specify the saturated component .",
    "there are a few models for @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "most of them are formulated in the color dipole picture , in which the projectile proton is treated as a color dipole , which interacts with the target proton .",
    "we shall use the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the total cross section is given by : _",
    "sat= d^2 r |_p(r)|^ 2 _ dip ( x , r ) [ sigsat ] where @xmath36 is the dipole transverse radius and the proton wave function @xmath37 is chosen to be : @xmath38 with @xmath39 fm and the dipole - proton cross section reads : _",
    "dip(x , r ) = 2 d^2 b ( x , r , b ) = ( x , r ) [ sigdip ] where @xmath40 , with @xmath41 fm . the dipole scattering amplitude , @xmath42 , should be given by the impact parameter dependent solution of a non - linear evolution equation , such as the balitsky - kovchegov equation @xcite . a complete solution is not yet available and we would have to use models for @xmath42 .",
    "in @xcite it was assumed that @xmath42 falls exponentially with @xmath43 . in this case",
    "@xmath22 does not violate the froissart bound .",
    "however in @xcite it has been argued that the dipole amplitude decays only as a power of the impact parameter in the periphery of the proton and this dependence will , after integration in @xmath43 , lead to logarithmic divergences .",
    "here we prefer to avoid the use of models and , instead , assume the factorization implied by the second equality in ( [ sigdip ] ) . with this assumption",
    "we decouple the impact parameter and energy dependences and focus only on the energy behavior of the dipole and hadron - hadron cross sections .    in the literature",
    "there are many parameterizations of the dipole amplitude .",
    "a brief discussion of the features of some recent ones can be found in @xcite . in",
    "what follows we shall use two of them , which were shown to give a reasonable description of both hera and rhic data @xcite .",
    "most of the parameterizations follow the glauber - like formula originally introduced by golec - biernat and wsthoff @xcite .",
    "the differences among them are in the anomalous dimension , @xmath44 . in the kkt model",
    "@xcite the expression for the quark dipole - target forward scattering amplitude is given by @xcite : [ glauber2 ] ( r , x ) = 1- .",
    "where @xmath45 and the anomalous dimension @xmath46 is [ gamma ] ( y , r^2 ) = ( 1 + ) , with @xmath47 a free parameter ( which was fixed in @xcite to @xmath48 ) and [ xi ] ( y , r^2 ) = .",
    "the authors of @xcite assume that the saturation scale can be expressed by @xmath49 .",
    "the form of the anomalous dimension is inspired by the analytical solutions to the bfkl equation .",

    "( [ gamma ] ) reduces to the expression of the anomalous dimension near the saddle point in the leading logarithmic approximation @xmath53 .",

    "@xcite it is assumed that a characteristic value of @xmath36 is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the transverse momentum of the valence quark and @xmath44 was approximated by @xmath56 . in the above expressions",

    "moreover , the authors assume @xmath59 .",
    "the initial saturation scale used in ( [ xi ] ) is defined by @xmath60 with @xmath61 being the lowest value of rapidity at which the low-@xmath3 quantum evolution effects are essential . as demonstrated in ref .",

    "the perturbative component is the same.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in ref .",
    "@xcite another phenomenological saturation model has been proposed in order to describe the @xmath62 rhic data ( hereafter denoted dhj model ) .",
    "the basic modification with respect to the kkt model is the parameterization of the anomalous dimension which is now given by [ gamma_dhj ] ( y , r^2 ) = _ s + ( y , r^2 ) where ( y , r^2 ) = ( 1 - _ s ) , with @xmath63 a typical hard scale in the process , @xmath64 and @xmath65 . moreover , @xmath66 is the anomalous dimension of the bfkl evolution with saturation boundary condition .",

    "@xcite , based on the universality of the hadronic wave function predicted by the cgc formalism , we might expect that the kkt and dhj parameterizations would also describe the hera data on proton structure functions in the kinematical region where the saturation effects should be present ( small @xmath3 and low @xmath18 ) .",

    "_ i. e. _ that the typical scale is energy independent .",
    "in order to calculate @xmath22 , it is also necessary to specify the bjorken-@xmath3 variable as in our previous calculations of @xmath6 .",
    "we use the same prescription and the same value for @xmath34 .",
    "in fig . [ fig2 ] we show in arbitrary units the energy behavior of the ratios @xmath73 ( solid lines ) and @xmath74 ( dotted lines ) for two choices of @xmath30 .",

    "the best choice for @xmath30 is in the range @xmath86 , which is exactly the range predicted in theoretical estimates using cgc physics and usually obtained by the saturation models for the desy @xmath17 hera data .    in the theory of the cgc",
    "the parameter @xmath30 changes with the energy , being a function of the variable @xmath87 . since our analysis is applied to a wide range of energies we have included the energy dependence of @xmath30 as estimated in @xcite , which can be parameterized as : = 0.3 - 0.003 ( y - 5 ) [ lambes ] in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we compare the cross sections obtained with a fixed value of @xmath30 (= 0.25 ) and obtained with a `` running '' @xmath30 , according to ( [ lambes ] ) .",

    "in this paper we have proposed a simple model for the total @xmath1 cross section , which is an improvement of the minijet model with the inclusion of a window in the @xmath23-spectrum associated to the saturation physics .",
    "our model implies a natural cutoff for the perturbative calculations which modifies the energy behavior of this component , so that it satisfies the froissart bound .",
    "moreover , including the saturated component ( calculated with a dipole model ) , we obtain a satisfactory description of the experimental data . our results for the total @xmath1 cross section also satisfy the froissart bound .",
    "finally , we find a very interesting consistency between our model and the saturation models used to describe the hera data : similar values of @xmath30 are needed to describe both set of experimental data .    in other similar approaches , such as @xcite the saturated cross section",
    "is used over the entire @xmath23 domain , or equivalently , for dipoles of all sizes .",
    "this procedure has two disadvantages : it requires the introduction of an ( model dependent ) impact parameter dependence of the dipole cross section and it does not make use of the collinear factorization formula and the parton densities , which , in the high @xmath23 region , are very well studied both theoretically and experimentally . in this sense",
    "our work is an improvement on @xcite and on @xcite as well .",
