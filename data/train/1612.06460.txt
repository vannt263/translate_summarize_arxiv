    "although stochastic error models can sometimes be justified on physical grounds , often they are used for their simplicity rather than their accuracy in describing the effect of realistic environments .",

    ", gaussian bosonic environments are amenable to analytical and numerical studies and have characteristics that are beyond the standard stochastic models , such as correlations and memory effects .",

    "it only requires local gates and has a large `` threshold '' against stochastic error .",
    "in addition to the usual stochastic error threshold , it has also been partially benchmarked against gaussian error models @xcite . unfortunately , all previous work focused only on the quantum information fidelity after a single qec cycle .    in this paper , we take the discussion of the efficiency of the surface code against gaussian noise one step forward .",
    "we provide analytical expressions for the logical qubit fidelity after an arbitrary number of qec cycles in the presence of a bosonic gaussian environment .",
    "we then specialize the calculation for a particular `` superohmic '' environment and demonstrate that there are two possible regimes , depending on whether the coupling between the qubits and the environment is below or above a critical value : ( i ) below the critical value , information is preserved by qec ; ( ii ) information is lost otherwise .",
    "we further demonstrate that the `` threshold '' for a superohmic environment is identical to the `` threshold '' for a single qec cycle .",
    "hence , we demonstrate that for a superohmic environment memory effects and correlations between qec cycles are unimportant , thus confirming an old conjecture for a dense set of qubits @xcite .",

    "all threshold analyses of qec are based on some assumptions about the system and its environment .",
    "we start by presenting all the assumptions built into our expressions for the logical qubit fidelity in a concise and itemized fashion to make the text clear and accessible .",
    "our assumptions are in general favorable to the success of qec .",
    "therefore , our results must be regarded as a upper bound to the efficiency of the code against gaussian noise .",
    "we follow the list of assumptions with a brief review of the surface code in sec . [",
    "sec : surface - code ] , and finally introduce the gaussian bosonic environment in sec . [ sec : environment ] .",
    "the following assumptions relate to the ability to manipulate qubits :    * we assume that the initial logical state can be prepared flawlessly and it is disentangled from the environment .",
    "since this is one of the divincenzo s criteria @xcite , we do not regard this as a fundamental limitation to the analysis . * in order to avoid additional assumptions about how quantum gates are performed @xcite , we focus on a quantum memory . in other words , after quantum information is encoded into the logical hilbert space , no quantum gate is performed . * in a real situation , syndrome extraction would be faulty and time consuming , and could excite the environment @xcite .",
    "thus , in a real situation , some modelling of the measurement apparatus would have to be considered . in order to avoid this extra layer of complexity",
    ", we opt for considering the syndrome extraction to the flawless and instantaneous . *",
    "we derive a general expression for the fidelity of the logical qubit after several qec steps . at the end of each cycle",
    "different syndromes could be measured and a proper recovery operation would have to be performed @xcite . however , there is no guarantee that the recovery operation would be the correct one @xcite .",
    "it is only possible to define an intrinsic threshold for the code if we assume that all syndrome measurements return a nonerror ( more precisely , no detectable errors ) . even though this is a very particular evolution , it is the only one that does not depend on a recovery strategy .",
    "there are several possible microscopic models that apply to real environments .",
    "however , very few choices are amenable to an analytical or numerical calculation . in order to gain some insight into the basic structure of a quantum environment and its effects on the surface code threshold",
    ", we assume that :    * the environment can be initially refrigerated to its lowest possible energy state .",
    "it is conceivable that over a long period of time an environment can be refrigerated to extremely low temperatures .",
    "this constitutes the very best scenario for quantum information processing , since it provides the best possible coherence times .",
    "however , more likely in practice , after this initial step , the dynamics between the qubits and the environment can lead to excitations in the environment .",
    "we thus assume that the duration of the qec is shorter than the time needed to refrigerate the environment . * in order to derive exact analytical expression for the evolution operator of the qubits , we restrict the errors induced by the environment to bit flips .",
    "* there are many possible dispersion relations for a gaussian environment .",
    "a particularly simple choice is to consider a linear dispersion relation , @xmath1 , and a constant velocity of excitations , @xmath2 .",
    "this is not a restricting choice , but just a convenient one .",
    "a more crucial quantity to be defined is the environment s spectral function @xcite . *",

    "additional logical qubits can be encoded in the same set of physical qubits by relaxing the stabilizers constrains @xcite .",

    "<S> this assumption makes our analysis independent of the recovery process . </S>",
    "<S> we map the expression for the time evolution of the memory onto the partition function of an equivalent statistical mechanical spin system . in the superohmic dissipation case </S>",
    "<S> the long - time evolution of the memory has the same behavior as the time evolution for just one qec cycle . </S>",
    "<S> for this case we find analytical expressions for the critical parameters of the order - disorder phase transition of an equivalent spin system . </S>",
    "<S> these critical parameters determine the threshold value for the system - environment coupling below which it is possible to preserve the memory s state . </S>"
