    "for many random constraint satisfaction problems ( csp ) , such as random graph coloring , random @xmath1-sat , random max @xmath1-sat , and hypergraph 2-coloring , by now , we have asymptotically tight estimates for the largest constraint density for which typical instances have solutions ( see  @xcite ) . at the same time ,",
    "all known efficient algorithms for each problem fair very poorly , i.e. , they stop finding solutions at constraint densities _ much _ lower than those for which we can prove that solutions exist . adding insult to injury ,",
    "the best known algorithm for each problem asymptotically fairs no better than certain extremely naive algorithms for the problem .",
    "for example , it has been known for nearly twenty years  @xcite that the following very simple algorithm will find a satisfying assignment of a random @xmath1-cnf formula with @xmath5 clauses for @xmath6 : if there is a unit clause satisfy it ; otherwise assign a random value to a random unassigned variable .",
    "while it is known that random @xmath1-cnf remain satisfiable for @xmath7 , no polynomial - time algorithm is known to find satisfying assignments for @xmath8 for some function @xmath9 .",
    "similarly , for all @xmath10 , the following algorithm  @xcite will @xmath1-color a random graph with average degree @xmath11 : select a random vertex with fewest available colors left and assign it a random available color .",
    "while it is known that random graphs remains @xmath1-colorable for @xmath12 , no polynomial - time algorithm is known that can @xmath1-color a random graph of average degree @xmath13 for some fixed @xmath14 and arbitrarily large @xmath1 .",
    "equivalently , while it is trivial to color a random graph using twice as many colors as its chromatic number , no polynomial - time algorithm is known that can get by with @xmath0 colors , for some fixed @xmath15 .",
    "random @xmath1-sat and random graph coloring are not alone .",
    "in fact , for nearly every random csp of interest , the known results establish a completely analogous state of the art :    1 .",
    "[ u ] there is a trivial upper bound on the largest constraint density for which solutions exist . 2 .",
    "[ l ] there is a non - constructive proof , usually via the second moment method , that the bound from  ( [ u ] ) is essentially tight , i.e. , that solutions do exist for densities nearly as high as the trivial upper bound .",
    "[ s ] some simple algorithm finds solutions up to a constraint density much below the one from ( [ l ] ) .",
    "4 .   [ a ]",
    "no polynomial - time algorithm is known to succeed for a density asymptotically greater than that in ( [ s ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we prove that this is not a coincidence .",
    "namely , for random graph coloring , random @xmath1-sat , and random hypergraph 2-coloring , we prove that the point where all known algorithms stop is precisely the point where the geometry of the space of solutions undergoes a dramatic change",
    ". this is known as a `` dynamical '' phase transition in statistical physics and our results establish rigorously for random csps a large part of the `` 1-step replica symmetry breaking '' hypothesis  @xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", this hypothesis asserts that while the set of solutions for low densities looks like a giant ball , at some critical point this ball shatters into exponentially many pieces that are far apart from one another and separated by huge `` energy barriers '' .",
    "algorithms ( even extremely simple ones ) have no problem finding solutions in the `` ball '' regime , but no algorithm is known that can find solutions in the `` error - correcting code '' regime .",
    "we believe that the presence of dynamical phase transitions in random csps is a very general phenomenon , whose qualitative characteristics should be problem - independent , i.e. , _ universal_. the fact that we can establish the exact same qualitative picture for a problem with binary constraints over @xmath1-ary variables ( random graph @xmath1-coloring ) and a problem with @xmath1-ary constraints over binary variables ( hypergraph 2-colorability ) certainly lends support to this notion .",
    "that said , we wish to emphasize that determining for each random csp the location of its dynamical phase transition ( as we do in this paper for the three problems mentioned , in order to show that the transition coincides with the demise of all known algorithms ) requires non - trivial , problem - specific ideas and computations .",
    "perhaps the following is an intuitive model of how a dynamical phase transition comes about . in random graph coloring , rather than thinking of the number of available colors as fixed and the constraint density ( number of edges ) as increasing ,",
    "imagine that we keep the constraint density fixed , but we keep decreasing the number of available colors .",
    "if we start with @xmath16 available colors where @xmath17 , it is reasonable to imagine that the set of valid @xmath16-colorings , viewed as a subset of @xmath18 , has a nice `` round '' shape , the rounder the greater @xmath16 is relative to @xmath19 . by the same token ,",
    "when we restrict our attention to the set of those @xmath16-colorings that only use colors @xmath20 , we are taking a ",
    "slice of the set of @xmath16-colorings . with each slicing the connectivity of the set at hands",
    "deteriorates , until at some point the set shatters .",
    "for example , slicing the 2-dimensional unit sphere through the origin yields a circle , but slicing the circle , yields a pair of points .",
    "we conclude the introduction with a few words about the technical foundation for our work . to prove the existence ( and determine the location ) of a dynamical phase transition one",
    "needs access to statistical properties of the uniform measure over solutions .",
    "a geometric way of thinking about this is as follows .",
    "given a csp instance , say a @xmath1-cnf formula with @xmath21 clauses chosen uniformly at random , consider the function @xmath22 on @xmath23 that assigns to each truth assignment the number of clauses it violates .",
    "in this manner , @xmath22 defines a `` landscape '' in which satisfying assignments correspond to valleys at sea - level .",
    "understanding statistical properties of the uniform measure over solutions amounts to understanding `` the view '' one enjoys from such a valley , a probabilistically formidable task .",
    "as we discuss in section  [ departure ] , we can establish the following : the number of solutions of a random csp is sufficiently concentrated around its exponentially large expectation for the view from a random sea - level valley to be `` the same '' as the view from an `` artificial '' valley .",
    "that is , from the valley that results by first selecting a random @xmath24 and then forming a random formula , also with @xmath21 clauses , but now chosen uniformly among the clauses satisfied by @xmath25 , i.e. , the view from the _ planted _ satisfying assignment in the planted model .",
    "this is a _ much _ easier view to understand and we believe that the `` transfer '' theorems we establish in this paper will significantly aid in the analysis of random csps .",
    "to present our results in a uniform manner we need to introduce some common notions .",
    "let @xmath26 be a set of @xmath27 variables , all with the same domain @xmath28 , and let @xmath29 be an arbitrary set of constraints over the variables in @xmath26 .",
    "a csp instance is a subset of @xmath29 .",

    "in  @xcite , mzard , parisi , and zecchina proposed a new satisfiability algorithm called survey propagation ( sp ) which performs extremely well experimentally on instances of random 3-sat .",
    "this was very surprising at the time and allowed for optimism that , perhaps , random @xmath1-sat instances might not be so hard .",
    "moreover , sp was generalized to other problems , e.g. , @xmath1-coloring  @xcite and max @xmath1-sat  @xcite .",
    "an experimental evaluation of sp for values of @xmath1 even as small as 5 or 6 is already somewhat problematic , but to the extent it is reliable it strongly suggests that sp does not find solutions for densities as high as those for which solutions are known to exist .",

    "the trouble is that to use either bp or sp to find satisfying assignments one sets variables iteratively .",

    "the idea of deterministically embedding a property inside a random structure is very old and , in general , the process of doing this is referred to as `` planting '' the property . in our case , we plant a solution @xmath25 in a random csp , by only including constraints compatible with @xmath25 . juels and peinado  @xcite were perhaps the first to explore the relationship between the planted and the uniform model and they did so for the clique problem in dense random graphs @xmath108 ,",
    "i.e. , where each edge appears independently with probability 1/2 .",
    "they showed the distribution resulting from first choosing @xmath109 and then planting a clique of size @xmath110 is very close to @xmath108 and suggested this as a scheme to obtain a one - way - function .",
    "since the planted clique has size only @xmath110 , the basic argument in  @xcite is closely related to subgraph counting .",
    "in contrast , the objects under consideration in our work ( @xmath1-colorings , satisfying assignments , etc . ) have an immediate impact on the _ global _ structure of the combinatorial object being considered , rather than just being local features , such as a clique on @xmath103 vertices .",
    "coja - oghlan , krivelevich , and vilenchik  @xcite proved that for constraint densities well above the threshold for the existence of solutions , the planted model for @xmath1-coloring and @xmath1-sat is equivalent to the uniform distribution _ conditional _ on the ( exponentially unlikely ) existence of at least one solution . in this conditional distribution as well as in the high - density planted model ,",
    "the geometry of the solution space is very simple , as there is precisely one cluster of solutions .      in  @xcite",
    "the first steps were made towards understanding the solution - space geometry of random @xmath1-cnf formulas by proving the existence of shattering and the presence of rigid variables for @xmath111 .",
    "this was a far cry from the true @xmath112 threshold for the onset of both phenomena , as we establish here .",
    "besides the quantitative aspect , there is also a fundamentally important difference in the methods employed in  @xcite vs.  those employed here . in those works ,",
    "properties were established by taking a union bound over all satisfying assignments .",
    "it is not hard to show that the derived results are best possible using those methods and , in fact , there is good reason to believe that the results are genuinely tight , i.e. , that for densities @xmath113 the derived properties simply do not hold for _ all _ satisfying assignments . here",
    ", we instead establish a systematic connection between the planted model and the process of sampling a random solution of a random instance .",
    "this argument allows us to analyze `` typical '' solutions while allowing for the possibility that a ( relatively small , though exponential ) number of `` atypical '' solutions exist .",
    "therefore , we are for the first time in a position to analyze the extremely complex energy landscape of below - threshold instances of random csps , and to estimate quantities that appeared completely out of reach prior to this work .",
    "as mentioned , the results in this paper are enabled by a set of technical lemmas that allow one to reduce the study of `` random solutions of random csp instances '' to the study of `` planted csp solutions '' .",
    "the conceptual origin of these lemmas can be traced to the following humble observation .",
    "let @xmath114 be an arbitrary @xmath115-@xmath116 matrix with the property that all its rows have the same number of 1s and all its columns have the same the number of 1s . a moment",
    "s reflection makes it clear that for such a matrix , both of the following methods select a uniformly random 1 from the entire matrix :    1 .",
    "select a uniformly random column and then a uniformly random 1 in that column .",
    "2 .   select a uniformly random row and then a uniformly random 1 in that row .",
    "an example of how we employ this fact for random csps is as follows .",
    "let @xmath117 be the set of all @xmath1-cnf formulas with @xmath27 variables and @xmath21 distinct clauses ( chosen among all @xmath118 possible @xmath1-clauses ) .",
    "say that @xmath119 nae - satisfies a formula @xmath120 if under @xmath25 , every clause of @xmath121 has at least one satisfied and at least one falsified literal .",
    "let @xmath114 be the @xmath122 matrix where@xmath123 iff @xmath24 nae - satisfies @xmath121 . by the symmetry of @xmath117 ,",
    "it is clear that all rows of @xmath114 have the same number of 1s .",
    "imagine , for a moment , that the same was true for all columns .",
    "then , a uniformly random solution of a uniformly random instance would be distributed _ exactly _ as a `` planted '' instance - solution pair : first select @xmath124 uniformly at random ; then select @xmath21 distinct clauses uniformly at random among all @xmath125 clauses nae - satisfied by @xmath25 .",
    "our contribution begins with the realization that exact row- and column - balance is not necessary .",
    "rather , it is enough for the 1s in @xmath114 to be  well - spread \" .",
    "more precisely , it is enough that the marginal distributions induced on the rows and columns of @xmath114 by selecting a uniformly random 1 from the entire matrix are both `` reasonably close to '' uniform .",
    "for example , assume we can prove that @xmath126 columns of @xmath114 have @xmath127 1s , where @xmath80 is the average number of 1s per column .",
    "indeed , this is precisely the kind of property implied by the success of the second moment method for random nae-@xmath1-sat  @xcite . under this assumption ,",
    "proving that a property holds w.u.p.p .  for a uniformly random solution of a uniformly random instance ,",
    "reduces to proving that it holds w.h.p .  for the planted solution of a planted instance , a dramatically simpler task .",
    "there is a geometric intuition behind our transfer theorems which is more conveniently described when every constraint is included independently with the same probability @xmath128 , i.e. , we take @xmath129 . for all @xmath10 and @xmath5 ,",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the resulting instances w.u.p.p .",
    "have exponentially many solutions for @xmath130 .",
    "consider now the following way of generating _ planted _ nae @xmath1-sat instances .",
    "first , select a formula @xmath121 by including each clause with probability @xmath128 , exactly as above . then , select @xmath119 uniformly at random and remove from @xmath121 all constraints violated by @xmath25 .",
    "call the resulting instance @xmath131 .",
    "our results say that as long as @xmath132 , the instance @xmath131 is  nearly indistinguishable \" from a _ uniform _ instance created by including each clause with probability @xmath16 .",
    "( we will make this statement precise shortly . )    to see how this happens , recall the function @xmath133 counting the number of violated constraints under each assignment . clearly , selecting @xmath121 specifies such a function @xmath134 , while selecting @xmath119 and removing all constraints violated by @xmath25 amounts to modifying @xmath134 so that @xmath135 .",
    "one can imagine that such a modification creates a gradient in the vicinity of @xmath25 , a  crater \" with @xmath25 at its bottom .",
    "what we prove is that as long as @xmath134 already had an exponential number of craters and the number of craters is concentrated , adding one more crater does not make a big difference .",
    "of course , if the density is increased further , the opened crater becomes increasingly obvious , as it takes a larger and larger cone to get from the typical values of @xmath134 down to 0 .",
    "hence the ease with which algorithms solve planted instances of high density .    to prove our transfer theorems we instantiate this idea for random graph @xmath1-coloring , random @xmath1-uniform hypergraph @xmath136-coloring , and random @xmath1-sat .",
    "for this , a crucial step is deriving a lower bound on the number of solutions of a random instance .",
    "for example , in the case of random graph @xmath1-coloring , we prove that the number of @xmath1-colorings , @xmath137 , for a random graph with @xmath27 vertices and @xmath21 edges is `` concentrated '' around its expectation in the sense that w.h.p .",
    "@xmath138 to prove this , we use the upper bound on the second moment @xmath139 from  @xcite to show that w.u.p.p .",
    "then , we perform a sharp threshold analysis , using theorems of friedgut  @xcite , to prove that  ( [ eqcollower ] ) holds , in fact , with _ high _ probability .",
    "a similar approach applies to hypegraph @xmath136-coloring .",
    "the situation for random @xmath1-sat is more involved .",
    "indeed , we can prove that the number of satisfying assignments is _ not _ concentrated around its expectation in the sense of  ( [ eqcollower ] ) .",
    "this problem is mirrored by the fact that the second moment of the number of satisfying assignments exceeds the square of the first moment by an exponential factor ( for any constraint density ) .",
    "nonetheless , letting @xmath141 denote a uniformly random @xmath1-cnf formula with @xmath27 variables and @xmath21 clauses , combining techniques from  @xcite with a sharp threshold analysis , we can derive a lower bound on the number of satisfying assignments that holds w.h.p .",
    ", namely @xmath142 , where @xmath143 exponentially with @xmath1 .",
