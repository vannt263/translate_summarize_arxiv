    "the prevailing approach to solving the horizon and flatness problems of conventional big bang cosmology is inflation , a period in which the universe underwent exponential expansion due to the effects of the nearly constant energy density provided by a scalar field  @xcite . models of inflation are often studied in terms of the properties of the inflaton potential , with somewhat less focus on other roles the inflaton might play in extensions of the standard model .",
    "if the inflaton has no purpose other than to provide the source of the energy density that drives inflation , then model building becomes isomorphic to studying ways of generating different functional forms for the inflaton potential .",
    "these possibilities , now cataloged ( see for example  @xcite ) , differ in their detailed predictions for the spectrum of fluctuations in the microwave background that are observed in experiments like planck  @xcite and bicep2  @xcite .    in this paper , we consider a scenario in which the inflaton is an integral component of an extension of the standard model that aims to address one of its substantial mysteries : the hierarchy of elementary fermion masses .",
    "models of flavor based on horizontal discrete symmetries postulate that these symmetries are broken via a set of fields , called flavons , that couple to standard model fermions through higher - dimension operators .",
    "discrete flavor symmetries can often lead to accidental continuous global symmetries among the renormalizable terms of the flavon potential . in the present work",
    ", we consider the possibility that the inflaton may be identified as a linear combination of the approximate goldstone bosons that arise when these accidental symmetries are spontaneously broken",
    ". we will ultimately be interested in two - field models of inflation , for reasons described below , which distinguishes the present work from the relatively sparse literature that explores the use of flavon fields for a similar purpose  @xcite .",
    "consider the simplest possibility , a @xmath0 flavor symmetry under which a single flavon field @xmath1 transforms as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 . if the fermions of the standard model are charged under the discrete group , then a tree - level yukawa coupling that would otherwise be forbidden can arise via a higher - dimension operator .",
    "for example , for a down - type quark , one might have @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the standard model higgs doublet , @xmath6 is the flavor scale , and @xmath7 is an integer . the yukawa coupling is associated with the ratio @xmath8 which can be much less than one ; operators with different values of @xmath7 can easily provide a hierarchical pattern of entries in the associated yukawa matrix .",
    "if less than the planck scale , the scale @xmath6 is identified with that of new heavy states that account for the origin of the higher - dimension operators . however , a simpler assumption , that we adopt henceforth , is that the scale @xmath6 is the reduced planck scale @xmath9 ; the desired operators appear as part of the most general set that are allowed by the local symmetries of the theory , as one expects based on our current understanding of quantum gravity  @xcite .",
    "an immediate implication of our assumptions is that the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath10 , which will provide an important constraint in our attempt to identify the inflaton with a part of the field @xmath1 .    to obtain an inflaton potential that is sufficiently flat , we require that the goldstone boson degree - of - freedom receives no contributions to its potential from renormalizable terms involving @xmath1 .",

    "planck - suppressed operators that directly break the discrete flavor symmetry are not present since we assume in this example ( and will require in all our models henceforth ) that we work with discrete gauge symmetries , which satisfy appropriate anomaly cancellation conditions and are immune to quantum gravitational corrections . for the reader who is unfamiliar with discrete gauge symmetries , we review the basic issues relevant to our model building in the appendix .    the operator in eq .",

    ", this would imply that @xmath26 is not a small flavor - symmetry - breaking parameter and we lose the ability to predict standard model yukawa couplings in a controlled approximation .",
    "we therefore must consider other ways of generating potentials for the pseudo - goldstone inflaton that allow a sub - planckian decay content @xmath25 .",
    "the options assuming a single field inflation model are limited .",
    "for example , models of  multi - natural \" inflation  @xcite , in which one arranges for additional sinusoidal terms in the potential , can accommodate a sub - planckian flavon vev , but tend to predict @xmath27 in this limit  @xcite , at the very edge of the 95% exclusion region following from planck data . a different class of models that can more easily provide cosmological predictions consistent with planck data are two - field models of the axion monodromy type  @xcite .",

    "this is important in the present work since the ratios of the flavon vevs to the reduced planck scale serve as small flavor - symmetry - breaking parameters in our models , which allows one to predict the standard model yukawa coupling entries in a controlled approximation .",
    "in addition to making correct yukawa coupling predictions possible , the discrete symmetries of the theory also maintain the correct pattern of the interactions in a new gauge sector , leading to the desired form of the inflaton potential ; they also keep the quantum gravitational corrections to the potential well under control .",
    "the literature on models of standard model fermion masses is vast and it is imaginable that more economical and compelling examples of flavor - sector inflation models are yet to be found .",
    "the present work suggests that exploring the full landscape of such models may be a fertile direction for future investigation .",
    "this work was supported by the nsf under grants phy-1068008 and phy-1519644 .",
    "the authors thank joshua erlich for valuable discussions .",
    "it is well known that continuous gauge symmetries are not violated by quantum gravitational effects . under what circumstances",
    "is the same true for discrete symmetries ? it was noted long ago by ibez and ross ( ir )  @xcite that a discrete group that arises as a subgroup of a continuous gauge symmetry inherits this protection . while the full theory must satisfy the anomaly cancellation conditions relevant for the continuous gauge groups , ir determined the conditions that are relevant in the low - energy theory , below the scale at which the continuous gauge symmetries are broken .",
    "since some of the fermions in the complete theory may become massive and decoupled when symmetry breaking occurs , the low - energy theory includes only part of the fermion content that contributes to anomaly cancellation in the full theory .",
    "the low - energy constraints should refer only to the light fermion content , which in the present context corresponds to models defined below the reduced planck scale @xmath9 .",
    "if the appropriate consistency conditions are satisfied , the discrete gauge symmetry can be treated as fundamental , without reference to specific high - energy embeddings .",
    "the constraints that we apply in our model building are the linear ir conditions involving non - abelian gauge group factors ; these follow from triangle diagrams involving two non - abelian gauge group factors and one factor of the continuous gauge group in which the discrete symmetry is embedded .",
    "for example , the @xmath0-su(@xmath215)@xmath160 anomaly cancellation condition is  @xcite @xmath216 here @xmath33 is an integer , @xmath217 is the @xmath0 charge of the @xmath218 fermion ( which transforms under @xmath0 by @xmath219 $ ] ) and @xmath220 is the casimir invariant given by @xmath221 , where the @xmath222 are su(@xmath215 ) generators in the representation of the @xmath218 fermion . since all the fermions in the model presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : fmodel ] are in the fundamental representations of the relevant su(@xmath215 ) gauge groups , @xmath223 ; the linear ir conditions simply requires that the @xmath0 charges of the fermions that transform under a specified su(@xmath215 ) factor sum to an integer multiple of @xmath151 . according to ir , when @xmath151 is odd ( relevant to the model of sec .",
    "[ sec : fmodel ] ) the gravitational anomalies linear in @xmath0 are cancelled when the sum of all the @xmath0 charges are also an integer multiple of @xmath151 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that these conditions are satisfied by the charge assignments displayed in table  [ charges ] .    what about the other possible anomaly cancellation conditions ?",
    "first , ir note that the linear conditions involving the abelian gauge groups do not lead to any useful constraints on the low - energy theory  @xcite .",
    "banks and dine ( bd )  @xcite later showed that the ir conditions non - linear in the discrete group make a tacit assumption about the high - energy embedding of the theory , through the requirement that both the light and the heavy fermions have integer u(1 ) charges .",
    "bd show that there are consistent , non - anomalous theories ( ones in which the effective discrete symmetry at low energies is smaller than that of the full theory ) in which the low - energy spectrum does not satisfy the non - linear ir constraints ; their failure only implies the existence of heavy fermions with fractional charges .",
    "thus , the non - linear ir conditions are not required for the consistency of the low - energy effective theory .",
    "bd note that the surviving discrete anomaly cancellation conditions are physically sensible : for example , the condition for the cancellation of the @xmath0-su(@xmath215)@xmath160 anomaly also guarantees that there are no thooft interactions generated by su(@xmath215 ) instantons that would explicitly break the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "this physical constraint  @xcite is completely independent of the high - energy embedding .",
