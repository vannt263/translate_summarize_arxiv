    "studies aimed at understanding the consequences of the interaction of electromagnetic fields with metal , semiconductor and molecular nanostructures under the effort to construct , characterize , manipulate and control plasmonic devices @xcite . recurring themes in these studies are the plasmonic response of aggregates of nano - particles @xcite , and the possibility to transmit electromagnetic energy over constrictions substantially smaller than the radiation wavelength .",
    "composite structures ( metal - dielectric , metal - semiconductor ) are often found useful because light can localize at their interfaces .",
    "of particular importance are metal- molecule composites where strong plasmon - exciton coupling together with the non - linear optical response of the molecular system can generate new physical behavior on one hand and provide more control capabilities by tuning the molecular subsystem on the other .    in this paper",
    "we study a class of systems of the latter kind , focusing on the light transmission properties of a model system comprising metal rods and molecular aggregates of sub - wavelength dimensions .",
    "transmission properties of nano - size structure are usually discussed in two connotations .",
    "first , following early studies by gersten and nitzan @xcite there is substantial interest in the way plasmonic particles affect excitation energy transfer in molecular systems @xcite .",
    "second , plasmonic structure can operate as sub - wavelength waveguides which are important in the construction of light controlled nano - devices and nano - size optical communication and information storage systems @xcite . for the latter systems two principal design systems",
    "have been studied : one comprises a chain of nanoparticles @xcite , where waveguiding is achieved by plasmon - hopping between nanoparticles and energy transport may be regarded as motion along a plasmonic band .",
    "the other uses the optical properties of metal- dielectric ( including metal - vacuum ) interfaces @xcite .",
    "molecular aggregates were used in both design types . in refs .",
    "@xcite they are used as reporters for the distribution of electromagnetic energy along the waveguide , while in refs .",
    "@xcite they constitute an active constituent of the dielectric subsystem . another way in which a molecular component can affect the operation in devices based on plasmon hybridization and hopping is in affecting the hybridization characteristics of the system .",
    "obviously , the interactions between plasmonic excitations on different particles will depend on the molecular environment between them @xcite .",
    "when the molecular optical response is far from resonance with the relevant plasmonic frequencies this dependence may be accounted for by incorporating a host medium with a suitable dielectric constant . in the linear response regime",
    "a frequency dependent dielectric function can represent a molecular system in resonance with the plasmonic spectrum , however such a procedure may not properly account for the distinction between lifetime and dephasing relaxation processes .",
    "alternatively , the molecular subsystem is described here explicitly and quantum mechanically using a variant of the procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . this makes it possible to address the regime of _ strong exciton - plasmon coupling _",
    ", where the molecular species does not only modify the plasmon - plasmon coupling but becomes an active component of the transmitting system .",
    "we note in passing that the latter procedure can also describe the molecular system in the non - linear response regime @xcite , although we do not address this regime in the present study .",
    "the effect of strong exciton - plasmon coupling on the optical response properties of metal - molecules composites have been under active study for some time @xcite .",
    "here we focus on its manifestation in the electromagnetic energy- transmission properties of a system comprising two metal cylinders aligned along a common axis with a gap of variable length between them .",
    "light is injected into the system using a source point dipole located at one end of the two metal - rod system , and the transmitted intensity is recorded at the other end .",
    "the effect of a molecular aggregate filling the gap between the metal cylinders is studied in order to elucidate the role of several key parameters that characterize the molecular species ( a ) molecular density , ( b ) molecular transition frequency and ( c ) molecular lifetime and dephasing relaxation rates .",
    "we note that some issues related to this study were addressed in previous works . on the experimental side , benner et al @xcite",
    "have studied plasmon transmission ( and electronic conduction ) across small constrictions between metal wires , highlighting the need to account for heating and thermal expansion effects in realistic experiments .",
    "neuhauser and coworkers @xcite have placed a single molecule between two metal spheres in order to simulate its effect on the plasmon - plasmon coupling . while their single molecule model uses a similar density matrix description that can study the role of molecular relaxation processes , these issues where not explicitly addressed in these studies .",
    "our earlier work @xcite and a recent work by sadeghi @xcite have addressed the role of molecular dephasing in the coherent response of strongly coupled exciton - plasmon systems .",
    "gu and coworkers @xcite have recently considered the transmission of electromagnetic signal across a gap in a configuration similar to the one studied here , however without molecules .",
    "the present study is aimed to elucidate the way such transmitted energy is affected by strong exciton - plasmon coupling .",

    "this aspect of the model can be generalized in order to investigate the interesting possibility that molecular effects in plasmon transport can be affected by the molecular orientation . in this work",

    "this behavior characterizes systems in which spontaneous emission does not play a significant part in the spectral response ( in the present calculation using classical em field it is simply ignored ) . in such systems the optical response is dominated by the classical molecular polarization which is sensitive only to the sum @xmath115 .",
    "using a numerical scheme based on the coupled maxwell - bloch equations implemented within the fdtd electromagnetic numerical solver , we have studied the transfer of electromagnetic radiation across a molecular gap separating two co - axial metal cylinders . in the absence of the molecular spacer in the gap separating the rods this system exhibits the consequence of plasmon - plasmon coupling , in particular between longitudinal plasmons in the two rods .",
    "the nature and magnitude of this coupling can be studied by varying the gap width as well as by changing the length of one wire keeping the other fixed , which produces the familiar non - crossing behavior . as a function of frequency",
    "the transmission is dominated by a splitted longitudinal plasmon peak .",
    "the two hybrid modes are the dipole - like `` bonding '' mode characterized by a peak intensity in the gap , and a quadrupole - like `` antibonding '' mode whose amplitude vanishes at the gap center .    when off resonant @xmath0level molecules are placed in the gap , almost no effect on the frequency dependent transmission is observed .",
    "we have traced this behavior to the observation that much of the transmission takes place along the cylinders edge .",
    "the `` bonding '' mode is significantly affected by the dielectric properties of the gap .",
    "in contrast , when the molecular system is in resonance with the plasmonic lineshape , the transmission is strongly modified , showing characteristics of strong exciton - plasmon coupling , modifying mostly the transmission near the lower frequency `` bonding '' plasmon mode .",
    "it is interesting to note that the presence resonant molecules species in the gap affects not only the molecule - field interaction but also the spatial distribution of the field intensity and the electromagnetic energy flux across the junction .",
    "this study can be extended in several ways .",
    "first and obvious is the fact that the observation reported here can be sensitive to the molecular orientation in the gap . in the present study",
    "we have assumed that this orientation is random , implying an average isotropic molecular response , and a preferred molecular orientation may be an important parameter in determining the transmission across the junction . a more subtle issue is the role played by molecular fluorescence . in present experimental studies",
    "the fluorescence signal from dye molecules placed along the nano waveguide is used to report on the electromagnetic field distribution along the guide @xcite . in the configuration used in the present study spontaneous emission by strongly fluorescent molecule may play an active role in the observed optical response . to study",

    "<S> in contrast , when the molecular system is resonant with the plasmonic lineshape , the transmission is strongly modified , showing characteristics of strong exciton - plasmon coupling , modifying mostly the transmission near the lower frequency `` bonding '' plasmon mode . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of resonant molecules in the gap affects not only the molecule - field interaction but also the spatial distribution of the field intensity and the electromagnetic energy flux across the junction . </S>"
