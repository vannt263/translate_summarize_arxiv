    "contact binary stars of the w  uma - type ( also known as ew ) are unique objects @xcite .",
    "the luminosity , produced almost exclusively in the more massive component is efficiently distributed ( by poorly understood processes ) through the common envelope so that the surface brightness is practically identical over the whole visible surface of the binary ( the gravity variations over the surface introduce a very minor modification ) .",
    "thus , the effective temperature is everywhere  over the whole common surface  the same , in spite of usually very different masses hiding inside the common envelope .",
    "mass ratios are known to span the whole wide range , from almost unity ( v753  mon , @xmath3 , @xcite ) , to very small values , as small as @xmath4 ( sx  crv , @xcite ) .",
    "the more common  but more difficult to detect  small mass - ratio systems are the best illustration to why the contact binaries are so unique . simplifying : the primary component provides the luminosity , while both components provide the radiating area .",
    "thus , it is practical to consider the primary mass , @xmath5 , and the mass ratio , @xmath6 , as the two main parameters .",
    "the third parameter , the orbital period , @xmath7 , is related to the amount of the angular momentum in the system .",
    "the range of the primary masses is moderate and corresponds to main sequence spectral types from early a to early k and roughly maps into the orbital - period range of about 1.5 days to 0.22 days .",
    "since the period distribution appears to continue the @xmath8 shape ( as for other binaries ) to about 0.45 days , and shows a mild bending down between 0.45 and 0.25 days , the most common are short period systems with periods within 0.25  0.5 days , down to the sharp and currently unexplained cutoff at 0.22 days @xcite .",
    "the contact binaries are known to exist only within the main sequence .",
    "somewhat similar light curves of some giant or other more evolved binaries can be explained by semi - detached binaries or spotted stars .",
    "very rare early - type contact systems on the upper main sequence , including a few currently known o - type contact systems , do not appear to be very different from the more typical solar - type w  uma binaries , but will not be considered here .    with their special properties , the contact binaries of the w  uma type form a distinct group of objects which are very easy to detect and identify due to : ( 1 )  rather large amplitudes of light variations reaching one magnitude , ( 2 )  short orbital periods , so that limited ",
    "duration monitoring is sufficient .",
    "massive , systematic searches of the sky for stellar variability , such as the micro - lensing projects , have led to many detections of ew systems ; e.g.  in the first catalogue of ogle - i , as much as two thirds of the one thousand detected eclipsing binaries were ew systems @xcite .",
    "many ew systems have been detected during the galactic cluster searches , both in open and in globular clusters ( see @xcite for the references to the original works ) .",
    "contact binaries are not as convenient as detached binaries for distance determinations . although described by fewer parameters than detached binaries ( one potential in place of two independent radii ) , they have more complex geometry . as pointed by dr .",
    "r.  e. wilson during this conference , a single detached , eclipsing , double - line spectroscopic binary can provide a distance determination without any calibration , basically using the `` first - principles '' approach . in this respect ,",
    "the contact binaries are more like pulsating stars and  with still many uncertainties about their structure and adherence to the strict roche model  do require empirical luminosity calibrations .",
    "the rationale for the existence of a period  luminosity relation is based in the strong geometric constraints imposed by the common equipotential envelope which permit to consider an equivalent of the @xmath10 relation for contact binary systems . to obtain this ,",
    "one combines the total volume of the contact configuration , described by the roche common equipotential , with the kepler s law , @xmath11 .",
    "the volume of the binary system , @xmath12 , van be written in non - dimensional way as : @xmath13 .",
    "such a dimensionless value , @xmath14 , does depend slightly on the mass ratio @xmath15 and on the degree of contact , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 for the inner common equipotential surface with one point of contact at the lagrangian point @xmath18 ; @xmath19 for the outer surface opening to the space at @xmath20 ) .",
    "tables of @xmath21 have been calculated by @xcite .",
    "it is observed that most of contact binaries have @xmath22 ; however , this is a model - dependent result @xcite .    by defining the mean density of the whole configuration , @xmath23 , then eliminating @xmath24 , and by expressing the quantities in familiar units , one obtains the `` pulsation equation '' , @xmath25 , with @xmath7 in days and @xmath26 in g/@xmath27 ( figure  [ figq ] ) .",
    "the similarity of contact binaries to pulsating stars is not accidental as the underlying physical time scale , of the pulsation or of the orbital revolution , is the same familiar dynamical time scale .",
    "[ figq ]     for @xmath28 . ]",
    "one attempts to derives a luminosity calibration which would not depend on any spectroscopic data . instead of the size of the orbit , @xmath29 , we want to use the orbital period , @xmath7 .",
    "similarly as for the non - dimensional volume in the previous section , one can define the non - dimensional surface of the contact binary , @xmath30 , so that the total area , @xmath31 can be written as @xmath32 .",
    "again , @xmath33 , but this dependence is weak ( the tables are in @xcite ) .",
    "the luminosity of the system , can be written quite generally , as : @xmath34 .",
    "we remove the unknown @xmath29 using the kepler s law and , in its place , introduce the orbital period , @xmath7 , which is determinable with an accuracy by many orders of magnitude higher than any other quantity .",
    "one can rewrite all these as one equation for the absolute magnitude @xmath1 : @xmath35 note that the two first terms contain the @xmath36 dependence , then there is the `` infinitely well - known '' @xmath7term and then there are terms dependent on @xmath5 , @xmath15 and @xmath37 . as always ,",
    "when photometric data are available , @xmath36 can be estimated from the colour index or from the spectral type , but the last terms are not known and require spectroscopic data .",
    "we `` sweep them under the rug '' at this point to utilize the simplest possible calibration equation : @xmath38 in this period ",
    "colour relation ( plc ) , @xmath39 is any of the available colour indices such as @xmath40 or @xmath41 ; for each choice of the index , another set of the coefficients @xmath42 must be determined .",
    "lumping together all @xmath5 , @xmath15 and @xmath37 dependencies is not as artificial as it may seem as several hidden correlations exists between these parameters ; some of these correlations are in fact of substantial importance for the theory of the structure of these binaries @xcite .",
    "after a very early attempt @xcite , the two main works dealing with the subject were @xcite and @xcite(=rd97 ) , see also @xcite .",
    "several small improvements were discussed later in the context of the massive variable star searches , e.g. @xcite . while @xcite were based mostly on the open cluster data ( ew systems appear at a relative frequency of some 1/500  1/1000 in old open clusters ) , rd97 was based on the hipparcos data .",
    "the hipparcos database remains the best source and has recently been analyzed in great detail for the complete sample of systems with @xmath43 mag @xcite .",
    "the currently best calibrations utilizing de - reddened @xmath40 and @xmath41 colour indices are : @xmath44    the colour  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for the rd97 sample of contact binaries with hipparcos parallaxes is shown in figure  [ figcmd ] .",
    "the thin continuous and broken contours delineate the density of stars in the general hipparcos database ; one can see the main sequence , the red giant branch and the red clump .",
    "each binary system appears as one point corresponding to the combined brightness of both components at light maximum ; this is in concordance with the fact that there is just one ( common ) radiating area which radiates the energy produced ( mostly ) in one , more massive star .",
    "the expected dependence on the mass ratio is shown in the left corner of the figure .",
    "for @xmath45 two identical components provide equal amounts of luminosity so that the shift is upwards by 0.75 mag ; for @xmath46 the large radiating area , together with the diminished luminosity , result in lowering of the effective temperature .",
    "for the most typical cases with @xmath15 around 0.3 to 0.5 , there is almost no change of the luminosity relative to the single star case , but the reddening can reach up to 0.17 in @xmath40 . as we can see in the figure , the combined shift to the right and possibly evolution within the main sequence",
    "have resulted in the ew systems following the upper border of the ms for single stars .",
    "errors are estimated from the parallax errors . ]",
    "the cmd in fig .",
    "[ figcmd ] contains also the lines of equal orbital period , shown as slanted dotted lines .",
    "one can directly see that correlation between the colour and the period exists in that bluer , brighter systems have longer orbital periods .",
    "the `` period  colour '' relation was discovered by @xcite . on one hand , it complicates the matters by introducing an internal correlation between the quantities in the @xmath1 calibration so that they are not really `` orthogonal '' . on the other hand",
    ", it sometimes helps in weeding out variable stars which are of entirely different type in that the data points can not appear above and to the left of a short - period blue envelope ; they can only shift down to redder colour indices and to the right due to the evolution @xcite .",
    "there are several sources of uncertainties in the calibrations .",
    "the trigonometric parallaxes from the hipparcos mission introduce errors typically @xmath47 mag , but for a few systems in rd97 as large as 0.5 mag .",
    "while such large errors can be accounted for by an appropriate weighting , they lower the quality of the calibration . in addition , some of the binaries are unrecognized triple systems with an associated offset in brightness , loss in accuracy and even entirely false data for the parallaxes . as for all calibrations involving de - reddened colour indices , the @xmath1 estimates will depend on how well this procedure is actually done .",
    "the simplification of the calibration to the @xmath39 and @xmath48 dependence , as described in section  [ basis ] , also worsens the fit , but  by far ",
    "the main source of errors is in the photospheric spots on individual binaries .",
    "these binaries are very active and almost always show spots .",
    "a brightness calibration must simply assume some sort of an average for @xmath1 .",
    "when a simple mean weighted error is considered , then the deviations in rd97 are characterized by @xmath49 mag .",
    "this is however a pessimistic estimate because the monte ",
    "carlo simulations indicate that within the main range of the applicability , the typical errors are @xmath50 mag ( rd97 ) .",
    "as with any calibration for pulsating stars , one must establish the metallicity dependence of the plc relation . at first , when limited material was available , it seemed that such a dependence did exist @xcite , but  when much more extensive data for many globular clusters were added ",
    "a metallicity term @xmath51 $ ] became no longer needed @xcite .",
    "calibrations for contact systems in several globular clusters .",
    "the box labeled rd97 gives the schematic range of the parameters for the hipparcos sample .",
    "closed and open symbols are used for deviations from calibrations in @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the data for @xmath52 > 0 $ ] are for ngc  6791 which is an open cluster . ]",
    "the deviations from the @xmath1 calibrations , given in section  [ cals ] , are shown as the function of @xmath52 $ ] in fig .",
    "[ fig_feh ] .",
    "they are plotted for the whole wide range of accessible metallicities ranging within @xmath53 < + 0.3 $ ] .",
    "the negative values of @xmath52 $ ] are provided by globular clusters of various ages , while the only positive metallicity is for the rich , old , open cluster ngc  6791 @xcite .",
    "there is no discernible trend in the figure so that the solar - neighbourhood calibrations work well for contact systems of different metallicities , at least at the level of uncertainty shown in the figure ( @xmath54 and 0.27 for calibrations based on the @xmath40 ( filled circles ) and @xmath41 ( open circles ) , respectively ) .",
    "these estimates of the uncertainties may be exaggerated , because many additional factors tend to increase the scatter ; these could be errors in the assumed reddening and absorption corrections , the large measurement errors for faint stars in distant , crowded clusters and the uncertainties of the assumed distance moduli , @xmath55 .    in spite of",
    "what has been said above about lack of an explicit dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath52 $ ] , the contact binaries with other metallicity content are different than the disk population ones ; it is only that at the current level of accuracy there exists no need to introduce the metallicity corrections in @xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ fig_gc ] shows the cmd for systems in globular clusters with available @xmath40 or @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath40 panel shows also , as crosses , the same hipparcos ( rd97 ) systems as in the figure in section  [ cals ] .",
    "it is clear that the data points for globular - cluster binaries are shifted left and below the disk  population main sequence : the population  ii contact binaries are bluer and smaller i.e.  have shorter orbital periods .",
    "this latter property is clearly seen in the period distribution for globular cluster systems in @xcite .",
    "thus , the shift in the cmd is mostly horizontal in @xmath1 .",
    "this is a preliminary result which must be checked again as the data become more accurate .",
    "there are two final questions to answer : how many ew systems can one expect relative to other stars ? is there any danger of misclassification and taking other variable stars for contact binaries or vice versa ?",
    "the only information at present relates to our galaxy .",
    "the ew binaries are very common in the disk population . the estimate based on the ogle - i pencil",
    " beam search volume gave the density as high as 1/130 among late - a to early - k ms stars , a number consistent with some old open clusters @xcite .",
    "however , this high estimate is not confirmed by a rigorous analysis of the hipparcos , solar - neighbourhood sample limited to stars brighter than 7.5 magnitude @xcite ; this analysis suggests the relative density of about 1/500 ( this corresponds to the spatial density of @xmath56  pc@xmath57 ) .",
    "it is at present not clear , if the high density obtained from the ogle - i sample was due to the improperly accounted image blending or to a genuine increase of the contact - binary density in the central parts of the thick disk of our galaxy .",
    "the local volume around the sun to 20 pc contains about 300 main sequence stars of relevant spectral types @xcite . in this volume , we know only one ew system ( 44  boo , also known as i  boo ) .",
    "this simple estimate agrees with the lower number of the relative density of occurrence of the ew systems .",
    "it is possible that the main reason for the discrepancy in the density estimates is the mean population age .",
    "the fractional density definitely increases over time .",
    "it may be @xmath58 at 1  gy , about 1/500 at 5  gyr and may reach 1/100 for ages above that .",
    "note that the fractional density among blue stragglers in globular clusters appears to be as high as 1/45 @xcite .    the variable stars which can most likely be taken for contact binaries are short - period pulsating stars in the @xmath59  sct instability strip .",
    "g. handler ( private communication ) estimates that about 1/3 of stars within the @xmath59  sct instability strip are actually pulsating .",
    "this is confirmed by the statistics for the solar neighbourhood : within the appropriate range of the luminosity and colour , there are 32 stars within @xmath60 pc and 8 are known to pulsate so that the factor 1/3 is confirmed within the poisson fluctuation limit .    the horizontal branch , population  ii , short - period pulsators , the rr  lyr variables , are very infrequent in the solar neighbourhood ( the spatial density @xmath61  pc@xmath57 , hence 0.0002 within 20 pc around the sun , @xcite ) .",
    "also infrequent are the ms population  ii main sequence pulsators , the sx  phe stars ; their density can be roughly estimated as about 1/100 of the population  i @xmath59  sct stars .",
    "all these variables occur within narrow ranges of luminosities and spectral types , whereas contact binaries can consist of stars of any spectral types throughout the whole main sequence down to about k2  k4 ( it is not clear why they do not exist below this limit ) .        taking the estimates given above together",
    ", one finds that there are about @xmath62 more @xmath59  sct stars in the solar vicinity than ew binaries .",
    "however , there should be no great difficulty in distinguishing them apart as their light - variation amplitude and period distributions are quite different .",
    "@xmath59  sct tend to have very small amplitudes , @xmath63 mag , although large - amplitude variables do occur , see figure  [ fig_dist ] based on @xcite .",
    "but the most distinguishing is the period distribution : the @xmath59  sct stars have very short periods , @xmath64 days ( broken line ) .",
    "the contact binaries have longer periods starting just above 0.2 days . even if one assigns a wrong period to a ew system equal to @xmath65 ( dotted ) , this period in most cases will turn out to be still too long for a typical @xmath59  sct star .",
    "w  uma - type ( ew ) contact binaries are very easy to find in massive stellar variability programs , even in short - duration ones , thanks to the short orbital periods and large amplitudes of photometric variations .",
    "the @xmath1 calibrations utilizing de - reddened colour indices @xmath40 or @xmath41 and the periods can predict individual values to about @xmath2 mag , so that about a thousand systems are needed to reduce the group uncertainty to the level of @xmath66 .",
    "such large numbers will be discovered in the nearby galaxies once the surveys pass the threshold of @xmath67 which , for the local group typically corresponds to @xmath68 .",
    "the current calibrations involve de - reddened colour indices and thus remain sensitive to the reddening corrections .",
    "the widespread availability of the @xmath69-band data suggests development of calibrations based on the @xmath70 or @xmath71 indices ; this is a matter of the current work .",
    "the existing @xmath1 calibrations do not seem to require a correction for metallicity , but existence of a small @xmath52 $ ] term is not excluded .",
