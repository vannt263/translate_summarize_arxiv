    "the role of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) as an exceptional laboratory for the study of stellar populations and stellar evolution has been early recognized by many authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the star formation history and the related chemical evolution in the lmc have been studied through extensive photometric surveys ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and theoretically through detailed modeling @xcite .",
    "the advent of the 8  m vlt telescopes has opened a new era in the investigation of resolved stellar populations , by producing high quality / high resolution spectra , which allow the detailed chemical study of many single hot and cool stars in different regions of the lmc ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one of the most distinctive results of these studies is that , similarly to other nearby dwarf galaxies , the lmc shows clear signatures of a different chemical evolution with respect to the chemical evolution of the milky way sub - population components @xcite .",
    "another fundamental characteristic of the lmc is that its cluster population covers a wide metallicity distribution and contains a large population of massive objects covering a wide age range , which provide a unique opportunity of studying rich samples of intermediate mass stars ( @xmath2 3 - 8 @xmath3 ) and the details of their evolutionary phases .",
    "a large and still ongoing effort has been done to collect photometric and spectroscopic data of stars in the stellar clusters of this galaxy @xcite .    in this scenario , ngc  1866 can be considered as a milestone for understanding the chemical evolution of the youngest stellar populations in the lmc , because this cluster is extremely rich ( @xmath4 @xmath3 ) compared with the coeval lmc clusters , with an age of @xmath5 and mass of @xmath2 5 @xmath3 for the stars evolving off the main sequence ( ms ) @xcite and a metallicity close to the one of 47 tuc . concerning its metal content ,",
    "the only study based on high - resolution spectra is that by @xcite , including fe , o and al abundances for three member stars of the cluster , providing an iron abundance of [ fe / h]=  0.50@xmath00.1 dex , a solar abundance of [ o / fe ] and a mild depletion of [ al / fe ] with respect to the solar value .",
    "thus , high resolution spectroscopy properly coupled with a high quality color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of ngc  1866 represent a unique tool to probe our knowledge of nucleosynthesis and mixing processes in intermediate mass stars during their evolution off of the ms .",
    "a further advantage of studying this cluster is that lmc field stars can be easily identified as red giant branch ( rgb ) stars , and a comparison between the abundances of these rgb field stars with those for the young cluster stars will be very powerful to infer the chemical evolution processes in the lmc stellar population around the cluster and inside the cluster itself .",
    "we take advantage of the large database of photometric data available for ngc  1866 and the related comparison with theoretical isochrones @xcite , and combine it with new high resolution spectra obtained at the vlt of stars well identified in the cmd of the lmc cluster ngc  1866 and its field .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "the observations are described in the next section , while the assumptions on the stellar atmospheres are presented in section 3 .",
    "the chemical analysis and the related uncertainties are discussed in section 4 and 5 and the results on the abundances of the elements are reported in section 6 .",
    "section 7 provides a general discussion on the observed framework , a brief summary concludes the paper .",
    "the spectroscopic data set analyzed here has been obtained with the flames spectrograph @xcite at vlt kueyen 8.2  m telescope , in the combined uves+giraffe mode , allowing the simultaneous observation of 8 stars with the red arm of uves at high - resolution ( r@xmath242000 ) and of 132 with giraffe mid - resolution ( r@xmath220000 - 25000 ) fibers .",

    "+ the adopted giraffe set - ups provide a spectral coverage ( @xmath25600 - 6400 @xmath7 ) including several absorption lines of key elements such as iron , @xmath8 , iron - peak and neutron - capture elements .",
    "all the targets have been observed in these three setups , with a time exposure of 3600 sec for each individual exposure ( 5 for hr11 , 4 for hr12 and 3 for hr13 ) , realizing a global s / n ratio between 40 and 100 ( per pixel ) at @xmath26000 @xmath7 .",
    "the spectra have been reduced by the standard flames reduction pipeline which includes bias subtraction , flat - fielding , wavelength calibration with a reference th - ar calibration lamp and final extraction of the 1-dimensional spectra .",
    "the radial velocity of each spectrum has been derived with the cross - correlation task of the bldrs ( giraffe base - line data reduction software ) , while for the stars observed with uves the radial velocity has been estimated by measuring the centroids of several tens of un - blended lines .",
    "heliocentric corrections have been computed by using the iraf task rvcorrect .",
    "the stars with @xmath9200 km @xmath10 have been discarded because they likely belong to our galaxy , according to the radial velocity maps computed for the lmc by @xcite .",
    "we obtained an average heliocentric velocity for the cluster of @xmath11=298.5@xmath00.4 km @xmath10 ( @xmath1=1.6 km @xmath10 ) by using 16 stars , in good agreement with the previous determination by @xcite of @xmath11=299.8@xmath00.5 km @xmath10 ( @xmath1=1.4 km @xmath10 ) . in the computation of the average radial velocity",

    "the three cluster cepheids will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .        [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the star formation history ( sfh ) of irregular galaxies like the lmc is deeply different from the milky way ; it is thought to develop slowly , with several , short bursts of star formation , followed by long quiescent periods .",
    "the theoretical interpretation of the chemical patterns in stars belonging to lmc requires therefore some important caveats ; in particular , we stress the role that dynamical environmental processes ( such as tidal interaction and/or ram pressure stripping ) may have on the chemical evolution of a galaxy ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , @xcite have suggested that the lmc entered the galactic virial radius @xmath23 gyr ago , and tidal interactions with the galaxy and the small magellanic cloud likely triggered star formation that appears to have lasted @xmath21 gyr following that event . in our analysis we do not account for such effects . + as it is well known ,",
    "main classes of chemical polluters are :    * supernovae of type ia ( sn ia ) , responsible for a large production of iron and iron - peak elements ; * supernovae of type ii ( sn ii ) , which synthesize oxygen , @xmath8 elements , iron and iron - peak elements , elements belonging to the weak component of the s - process and the r - process elements ; * asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , which pollute the interstellar medium ( ism ) with carbon and elements belonging to the main component of the s - process .    at the moment , the exact stellar site in which the r - process takes place is still a matter of debate : this fact leads to strongly different nucleosynthetic paths depending on the adopted physics and theoretical assumptions @xcite .",
    "more robust theoretical predictions are available for the s - process @xcite , which characterizes the thermally pulsing phase of low mass agb stars ( tp - agb phase ) .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss three main aspects of our results : ( i )  the internal abundance scatter of the stars in ngc  1866 , in light of the self - enrichment scenario invoked to explain the internal abundance spread of the old gcs ; ( ii )  possible chemical variations due to the different evolutive stages of the observed stars in this work ; ( iii )  the chemical abundances of ngc  1866 and its surrounding field in light of the chemical evolution of the lmc .      before analyzing the spectroscopic patterns of single stars belonging to the cluster , it is useful to compare abundances of cluster stars with respect to stars lying in the surrounding field . from fig .",
    "[ average ] , in which we report mean values for ngc  1866 and for the field , it clearly emerges that the two groups present very similar spectroscopic patterns , showing values consistent within the error bars .",
    "as far as the light element are concerned ( o , na , al , mg ) , this pattern is quite different from what observed in globular cluster stars ( see e.g. the review by * ? ? ? * ) which show two distinctive aspects : ( i )  the first is that gc stars show a large spread in these light elements , indicating inhomogeneous pollution of h burning rich material , and ( ii )  the second that , because of these effect , the average abundances of gc stars are different from those of the field stars with similar metallicity .",
    "we shall emphasize that the chemical abundances of ngc  1866 do not show any evidence for these effects : _ we do not observe appreciable chemical spread within the cluster and the abundances of ngc  1866 are in very good agreement with those of the lmc field_.    self - pollution within the cluster , as originated for example by intermediate agb stars ( e.g. @xcite ) , can not be completely excluded because of the limited number of stars within our sample .",
    "however we note that in most galactic gcs observed with high resolution spectroscopy the percentage of polluted stars is significant , at least @xmath250% of the entire population ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and we should expect some clear detection within our stars sample . as shown in fig .",
    "[ anticor ] the stars of ngc  1866 well overlap the mean locus defined by the giants discussed in @xcite , with solar or mild sub - solar [ o / fe ] ratios and sub - solar [ na / fe ] ratios .",
    "this finding , combined with the good agreement between cluster and field stars abundance ratios , seems to confirm that all these stars belong to the first ( unpolluted ) generation of the clusters , while there are no hints of polluted stars . between the stars of ngc  1866 and the first generation stars of the old lmc and milky way",
    "gcs is appreciable in fig .",
    "[ anticor ] .",
    "this offset is only due the different chemical evolution of these clusters : in fact , the first generation stars of the old clusters share enhanced [ o / fe ] ratios , according to abundances observed in the halo stars , while the stars of ngc  1866 born from a medium enriched by type ia sne , and its first generation stars show solar - scaled pattern for the [ o / fe ] abundances . ]",
    "the lack of anti - correlations in ngc  1866 , as far as in the intermediate - age , massive lmc clusters , suggests that the younger lmc gcs do not undergo the self - enrichment process , following different formation and evolution processes with respect to the old stellar clusters ( in both milky way and the lmc ) .",
    "recently , @xcite propose to define gcs as those stellar clusters where a na - o anticorrelation is observed .",
    "this new definition has the appealing advantage to provide an easy boundary to separate gcs and other loose stellar systems ( as the open clusters ) .",
    "we stress that this is a _ local _ definition based only on the milky way stellar clusters , where there is clear separation in age and mass between open and globular clusters , and there is a lack of massive , young stellar clusters ( at variance with the lmc ) . according to this new definition , ngc  1866 ( and all the intermediate - age lmc clusters",
    "so far observed ) would not be classified as a globular cluster . however , these objects appear to be structurally different and more massive than the typical mass ( @xmath12 ) of the open clusters .",
    "thus , the young populous globular - like clusters in the lmc seem to be a class of objects intermediate between open clusters and _ true _",
    "( old ) globular clusters .",
    "the main question arising from these findings is to understand why these young lmc massive clusters do not suffer the self - enrichment process .",
    "previous investigations of old gcs show that several parameters ( e.g. mass , metallicity , orbital parameters ) may influence the amount of the self - enrichment process .",
    "we note that the most metal - rich galactic clusters ( with overall metallicities comparable to ngc  1866 ) are more massive than ngc  1866 by one order of magnitude and thus in the milky way there are no clusters similar to ngc  1866 in the mass / metallicity plane .",
    "the chemical homogeneity of ngc  1866 is very important because it demonstrates that the chemical inhomogeneities observed in the old gc stars are peculiar to these objects .",
    "ngc  1866 is only a few times less massive than ngc  6397 and m  4 where inhomogeneities have been observed , so it does not seem likely that mass alone can be the cause of the differences and other causes should be invoked , such as , for instance , the fast time formation of the gc and the ( in)homogeneity of the early ism .    however , a point to recall is that the young lmc clusters share with several old gcs the same _ present - day _ mass but probably not the same _ initial _ mass .",
    "in fact , dynamical simulations @xcite suggest that a large fraction of the first stellar generation is lost in the early evolution of the cluster and thus the _ initial _ mass of the cluster was one - two order of magnitude higher than the _ present - day _ mass .",
    "these findings suggest that gcs born with initial mass of the order of @xmath13 ( similar to the mass of the lmc clusters younger than @xmath22 gyr ) are not massive enough to retain their pristine gas and undergo the self - enrichment process .      since chemical abundance variations can be produced in evolved stars by several processes occurring during the stellar evolution , as a further step we analyzed the evolutionary status of stars in our sample , in order to determine whether we could find surface chemical variations due to events that occurred in their previous evolution .",
    "the majority of the target stars within our sample lie on their rgb and blue loop stages and also a few of stars ( the brightest and reddest ones ) belong to the agb phase .",
    "therefore , the majority of stars belonging to our sample have experienced a unique dredge up event , the so - called first dredge up ( fdu ) .",
    "stars belonging to ngc  1866 that evolve off of their main sequence phase have a mass of about @xmath14 ( according to the evolving mass of the cluster as found by @xcite ) . before their first ascent along the giant branch",
    ", stellar theory predicts that , in these stars , the fdu causes a strong depletion of @xmath15c ( @xmath16% @xmath17% ) , a noticeable enrichment of the surface nitrogen ( a factor 2 ) and a minor decrease of the oxygen surface abundance .",
    "unfortunately we could only determine the surface oxygen abundance and , therefore , we can not clearly identify the signature of fdu in our stars .",
    "we focus our attention on the most evolved object in our sample ( the star labelled # 2981 ) for which we can have a large number of elements ( due to the large spectral coverage provided from uves ) .",
    "there are other two stars ( namely , # 2131 and # 5231 ) that likely belong to the early - agb stage , but they are @xmath2200 k hotter than # 2981 and some elements can not be measured due to the giraffe spectral coverage . thus , these two stars are not ideal to identify evolutive , chemical changes . + in order to identify its precise evolutionary phase , we computed a model of a star with initial mass @xmath18 and @xmath19 by means of a recent version of the franec stellar evolutionary code @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ grav ] we compare the surface gravity and temperature of the model ( blue curve ) with data relative to # 2981 ( red triangle ) .",
    "the comparison shows that this star has not yet reached its tp - agb phase or , at least , it just suffered for a few tps .",
    "the structure of an agb star consists of a partial degenerate c - o core , an he - shell , an h - shell and a convective envelope .",
    "the hydrogen burning shell , which provides the energy necessary to sustain the stellar luminosity , is regularly switched off by the growth of thermal runaways ( _ thermal pulses _ , tps ) .",
    "these episodes , driven by violent he ignitions within the he buffer ( he - intershell ) , cause this region to become dynamically unstable against convection for short periods : once convection quenches off within the he - intershell , a period of quiet he - burning follows , during which the convective envelope can penetrate in the underlying layers ( this phenomenon is known as third dredge up , tdu ) , carrying to the surface the freshly synthesized carbon and s - process elements .",
    "if the star # 2981 would had already suffered a consistent number of tdu episodes , we would expect noticeable changes in its s - process surface abundances .",
    "a comparison between its spectroscopic data and the median overabundances of the cluster shows consistent values within error - bars ( see fig .",
    "[ agbz ] ) , therefore supporting the hypothesis that this star is still on its early - agb phase .",
    "unfortunately , spectral lines of some key light elements ( lithium , carbon and nitrogen ) are not contained in the observed spectral range .",
    "the abundance of these elements would provide more stringent chemical constraints on the evolutionary phase of # 2981 , owing to the occurrence of the already described tdu episodes or to the presence of other physical processes , such as the hot bottom burning ( hbb ) ( see , for example , the analysis presented by @xcite on their agb star labeled ngc  1866#4 ) .",
    "our analysis excludes that the spectroscopic patterns observed in ngc  1866 derive from the evolutionary phase of the observed stars or from the internal evolution of the cluster : a wider analysis , which spans over the entire evolutionary history of the lmc , is therefore necessary .",
    "such an analysis relies on many physical inputs , the most important being the sfh and the stellar yields .",
    "we just remind that , in the lmc , a rapid chemical enrichment occurred at a very early epoch , followed by a long period with reduced star formation and , most recently ( about 3 gyr ago ) , by another period of chemical enrichment ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "+ concerning the stellar yields , in order to reproduce the heavy elements ( @xmath20 ) observed spectroscopic patterns with theoretical models , we need to hypothesize that two classes of stellar objects polluted the ism before the formation of ngc  1866 : massive stars , which synthesized the r - process elements ( such as , for example , europium ) and the weak component of the s - process , and agb stars , which produced the elements belonging to the main component of the s - process . in fig .",
    "[ z3m3 ] we compare our theoretical expectations with spectroscopic data of # 2981 since , for this star , we have high resolution spectra and a more complete element line list at our disposal .",
    "note that some of the abundance ratios discussed in the follows are based on one only star ( see table  [ cl ] ) .",
    "a conservative errorbar of 0.2 dex has been adopted for each element .",
    "as already discussed , theoretical r - process distributions still suffer from major uncertainties , such as the identification of the stellar site or the determination of the precise relative abundance patterns .",
    "for this reason , the r - process contribution to the solar distribution is usually calculated based on the solar s - process contribution , following the formula @xmath21 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "then , a generic r - process distribution at a fixed metallicity can be obtained by normalizing the distribution to a single r - only element ( or to an element whose production is almost totally ascribed to the r - process ) and by adopting the solar elemental ratios for the other elements .",
    "we tentatively apply this procedure , which works well for the milky way ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , to ngc  1866 . in order to determine the r - process enrichment level we focus on europium . we know that about 95% of its galactic abundance can be ascribed to the r - process and we assume that the same should occur in the magellanic clouds .",
    "we fix the europium overabundance to the value of # 2981 , ( [ eu / fe]@xmath20.49 ) .",
    "then , we derive the r - process pattern by adopting the elemental r - process solar percentages tabulated in @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ z3m3 ] , the r - process contribution is highlighted with a blue dotted line .",
    "+ the s - process contribution has been calculated by means of the franec code , in which we couple a complete nuclear network ( able to follow in detail the whole s - process nucleosynthesis ) directly to the physical evolution of the model @xcite .",
    "we run , as a representative mass of agb pollution , a 2 @xmath22 model with @xmath23 and we hypothesize that the present - day observed s - process patterns result from the pollution due to a single generation of low mass agb stars .",
    "this assumption is justified by the relatively fast chemical evolution of lmc up to [ fe / h]@xmath21 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "then , we applied a dilution to the theoretical curve in order to match the cerium abundance ( red dotted curve in fig .  [ z3m3 ] ) : this dilution mimic the fact that the mass lost by agb stars has been mixed with s - process free material from which originate the present - day observed stars .",
    "+ the final theoretical distribution ( dark solid curve ) results from the sum of the s - process and the r - process contributions .",
    "the agreement with spectroscopic data is quite good , proving the validity of our theoretical scheme and validating the assumption made in the determination of the r - distribution of our sample ( thus possibly evidencing a sort of universality of the r - process ) .",
    "unfortunately , the current set of spectroscopic abundances can not lead us in precisely identifying the metallicity of agb population which previously polluted the ism . in fig .",
    "[ sproc ] , we show different theoretical chemical patterns ( including the r - component ) obtained with agb models of different metallicities ( red dotted line for @xmath24 , dark solid line for @xmath23 ( our reference model ) , blue dashed line for @xmath25 and magenta dot - dashed line for @xmath26 ) .",
    "note that , depending on the metallicity , theoretical models present different enrichment level ; before comparing them , we therefore normalize distributions to the cerium abundance in order to highlight the relative variations in the s - process shape .",
    "we only highlight the elements , within our sample , which receive a consistent contribution ( @xmath2750% ) from the s - process : within error - bars , our spectroscopic data do not permit us to clearly discriminate between the three distributions . in order to do that we would need to observe lead , at the termination of the s - process path , since the abundance of this element is extremely sensitive to the metallicity .",
    "in fact , the lower the metallicity , the more efficient the pb production is ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : ranging from @xmath26 to @xmath24 a difference of more than a factor 20 ( 1.3 dex ) is expected .        actually , @xcite determined the spectroscopic abundances of elements belonging to the three peaks of the s - process ( included lead in a lmc post - agb star ( macho 47.2496.8 ) .",
    "when looking to the relative distribution , it turns out that the observed path agrees well with our reference model , whose lead overabundance is comparable to the ones characterizing the _ hs _ elements",
    ". however , more statistics are needed before claiming any definitive chemical evolutionary theory .",
    "how do our conclusions fit into a more global view of the lmc chemical evolution ? in order to answer to this complex question we need to compare our data with other lmc samples and to extend our analysis to abundances of light elements , iron - peak elements and copper .",
    "+ concerning heavy elements abundances , stars belonging to lmc present noticeable differences with respect to their galactic counterparts ( see fig .  [ yzr ] and fig .",
    "[ bala ] ) .",
    "in fact , while in galactic stars the light elements and heavy elements distributions are nearly flat ( showing values around 0 ) , in lmc they present dichotomic trends .",
    "+ let us start from the heavy s - process ( _ hs _ ) elements . in 2006",
    ", @xcite performed a spectroscopic analysis on 10 red giants belonging to four old lmc gcs .",
    "apart from the most metal - poor gc ( hodge 11 ) , which shows no enhancements at all , in other clusters a mild enhancement of _ hs _ elements ( [ hs / fe]@xmath20.3 dex ) has been found .",
    "similarly , the study of 27 giants belonging to four intermediate - age lmc gcs by @xcite evidenced a smooth enhancement of heavy elements , consistent with that found in old lmc gcs .",
    "this trend , which also characterizes metal - poor red giants belonging to dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsph ) @xcite , can be easily ascribed to a different sfh of the hosting galaxy . in the lmc ,",
    "the slower temporal increase of iron with respect to the milky way makes the contribution from metal - poor agb stars more important at a given time or metallicity .",
    "since these objects produce more heavy elements than light elements , a rise of the heavy elements component has to be expected ( and it is actually observed ) .",
    "stars belonging to ncg  1866 , which formed only @xmath28 years ago , perfectly match the mild enhancement observed in others gcs ( see fig .",
    "[ bala ] ) . as stressed above , in order to determine the metallicity of this class of agb polluters ,",
    "the spectroscopic determination of lead is required .",
    "+ oppositely to _ hs _ elements , light s - process ( _ ls _ ) elements show a decreasing curve with respect to galactic stars at large metallicities .",
    "this trend is fully confirmed by our sample .",
    "a similar behaviour has also been observed in dsph s @xcite : beneath various theoretical recipes , these authors proposed that these underabundances with respect to the mw could be ascribed to a reduced contribution from metal - rich agb stars or to metallicity dependent yields from sn  ii @xcite . both hypotheses",
    "are strictly correlated to the peculiar chemical enrichment that the hosting galaxy experimented in the past . in lmc",
    ", the long gap between the two star formation bursts has played a fundamental role , melting the contributions from massive stars and snia in a different way with respect to the mw .",
    "a strong reduction in the sfr could have heavily reduced the contribution from agb stars of intermediate metallicities , causing in such a way a decrease of the light elements ( note that the yields of light elements from low mass agb stars grow with the metallicity ) . on the other hand , the behaviour of other elements efficiently produced by massive stars ( @xmath8 elements , na , mn and cu ) present , at a fixed metallicity , lower overabundances with respect to the mw ( see figures [ ona ] , [ alfa1 ] and [ mncu ] ) , suggesting _ de facto _ a reduced contribution from massive stars with respect to sn ia .",
    "this statement is however contrasted by the nearly flat europium distribution observed in lmc stars ( [ eu / fe]@xmath20.5 ) at all metallicities ( up to [ fe / h]@xmath29 ) vs [ fe / h ] diagram indicates that the considered element and iron are produced in equivalent proportions for different metallicities ] .",
    "we therefore conclude that a theoretical analysis based on stellar yields only can not lead to a clear explanation for the _ ls _ elements distribution in stars belong to the lmc . under this perspective",
    ", physical mechanisms involving the whole lmc structure have to be considered , such for example dynamical environmental processes @xcite or the presence of galactic winds @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the chemical abundances of 25 stars in the field of the lmc star cluster ngc  1866 .",
    "the accurate analysis and the high efficiency of flames@vlt allows us to obtain a set of high quality measurements of the abundances of this region of the lmc .",
    "we emphasize that we do not observe significant element by element abundance spread amongst the ngc  1866 stars , and we find that the cluster chemical pattern fits very well with the general pattern observed in the lmc field stars .",
    "we note that this is in stark contrast with what is observed with galactic globular clusters and our result , if confirmed on a larger sample of stars , would bring insight to the debate of the formation mechanisms for globular clusters in general .        \\2 .",
    "[ o / fe]=  0.07 ( @xmath1=  0.04 dex ) and [ na / fe]=-0.09 ( @xmath1=  0.05 dex ) abundance ratios appear to be lower than those measured in galactic stars and the o / na values are , within the uncertainties , very similar between different stars in ngc  1866 .    \\3 .",
    "the lack of anti - correlations suggests that ngc  1866 does not undergo the self - enrichment process at variance with the old gcs in both milky way and lmc .",
    "similar results have been found in the intermediate - age lmc clusters , suggesting that gcs formed with an initial mass of the order of @xmath30 are not massive enough to retain their pristine gas . also , other possible effects ( i.e. a mass / metallicity threshold , inhomogeneity of the early ism , tidal effects due to the interactions with the smc and the milky way ) can not be ruled out , playing a role to inhibit the self - enrichment process .",
    "abundances of neutron - capture elements are derived : in the case of y and zr values lower than the solar ones are measured , while [ ba / fe ] , [ la / fe ] , [ ce / fe ] and [ nd / fe ] ratios appear to be enhanced . the uves measurement of a single ngc  1866 star shows a value of [ eu / fe ] @xmath32  + 0.49 dex .    with this observational framework we applied modern stellar evolution theory and nucleosynthesis calculations to make three major conclusions .",
    "we do caution , however , that our data apply only to a single region of the lmc and that abundances of several key elements are lacking , and we hope that our work will stimulate further investigations , both observational and theoretical .",
    "notwithstanding , the following considerations can be emphasized :    ( i )   the very similar pattern found for the abundances of both field and cluster stars suggests that stars belonging to ngc  1866 originate from pollution episodes that occurred before the formation of the cluster .",
    "nevertheless , self - enrichment between cluster stars can not be completely ruled out because of the small number of stars .",
    "( ii )   surface chemical variations in evolved stars ( core he burning and early agb phases ) due to events that occurred in their previous evolution can not be recognized from data presented in this work .",
    "further observations of light elements are recommended to derive more robust constraints .",
    "( iii )  from a relatively simple model we show that the observed abundances of heavy elements ( z @xmath27 35 ) can be reproduced by the sum of s - process and r - process contributions as expected by pollution mechanisms due to i ) massive stars and ii ) single generation of low mass agb stars .",
    "however , the result obtained in this work suggest a further theoretical effort to properly understand the evolution of s - process elements ( in particular the _ ls _ ones ) in the context of the lmc chemical evolution .",
    "moreover , precise spectroscopic measurements of lead are suggested to provide indication on the metallicity of the low mass agb stars which could be significant contributors to the observed abundances of s - process elements in lmc stars .",

    "<S> the average iron abundance of ngc  1866 turns out to be [ fe / h]=  0.43@xmath00.01 dex ( with a dispersion @xmath1=  0.04 dex ) , from the analysis of 14 cluster - member stars . within our uncertainties , </S>",
    "<S> the cluster stars are homogeneous , as far as chemical composition is concerned , independent of the evolutionary status . </S>",
    "<S> the observed cluster stars do not show any sign of the light elements anti - correlation present in all the galactic globular clusters so far studied , and also found in the old lmc stellar clusters . </S>",
    "<S> a similar lack of anti - correlations has been detected in the massive intermediate - age lmc clusters , indicating a different formation / evolution scenario for the lmc massive clusters younger than @xmath2 3 gyr with respect to the old ones . </S>",
    "<S> + also opposite to the galactic globulars , the chemical composition of the older rgb field stars and of the young post - ms cluster stars show robust homogeneity suggesting a quite similar process of chemical evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the field and cluster abundances are in agreement with recent chemical analysis of lmc stars , which show a distinctive chemical pattern for this galaxy with respect to the milky way . </S>",
