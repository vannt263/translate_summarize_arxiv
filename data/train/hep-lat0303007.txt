    "the analytic continuation of a function , whose perturbation series expansion about a given point is known , is an important and long - standing problem .",
    "some standard methods are the use of pad approximants , or integrated differential approximants , as reviewed for instance by guttmann@xcite . in some circumstances",
    ", these techniques can work extremely well ; but in others they fail .",
    "a well known difficult case is that of a function whose series expansion about the origin in a variable @xmath0 , say , is known up to a given order , and we want to extrapolate to @xmath1 .",
    "if there is a cut or an essential singularity at infinity , the standard methods do not work well .",
    "this is a common situation in lattice gauge theory , for instance .    in recent years",
    ", a new method has been developed , involving `` feynman - kleinert approximants''@xcite .",
    "this is a variational technique , arising originally from a gaussian approximation to the path integral@xcite .",
    "it has been used with great success on a number of problems , such as extrapolation of the weak - coupling series for the anharmonic oscillator@xcite , where the asymptotic strong - coupling behaviour was obtained with extraordinary accuracy , up to 20 significant digits . for",
    "a discussion and further references , see the recent paper by kleinert@xcite .",
    "here we attempt to apply the new method to a lattice gauge theory , namely the schwinger model in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions . in",
    "the series approach to lattice gauge theory , one generates strong - coupling series expansions for the physical quantities of interest , and then tries to extrapolate to the continuum , weak - coupling limit",
    ". it would be an important breakthrough if a better technique could be found for performing this extrapolation . in the report we set out to test",
    "whether feynman - kleinert approximants can fulfill this need .",
    "unfortunately , we find that the technique is not very successful in this context .",
    "another common problem is that of interpolation of a function , where a number of series coefficients are known of _ both _ the weak - coupling and the strong - coupling expansions .",
    "an example of this arises for the low - lying energy eigenvalues in the continuum schwinger model , as functions of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the fermion mass and @xmath4 is the electric coupling .",
    "we show that feynman - kleinert approximants can provide an effective interpolation between these two limits .",
    "for reference , let us briefly recapitulate the algorithm set out by kleinert@xcite using his notation . consider a quantity @xmath5 whose perturbation series expansion in some parameter @xmath6",
    "is known to order @xmath7 : @xmath8 write @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an auxiliary parameter whose value will eventually be set equal to 1 , and @xmath11 are indices which will be chosen later to suit the problem at hand . now set @xmath12 , and re - expand @xmath13 in powers of @xmath14 , treating @xmath15 as a quantity of order @xmath6 , and truncating the re - expanded series at order @xmath7 .",
    "the result is a function @xmath16 where @xmath17 forming the first and second derivatives of @xmath18 with respect to @xmath19 ( and setting @xmath20 ) , we find the positions of the turning points .",
    "the smallest among these is denoted @xmath21 .",
    "the resulting @xmath22 gives the desired approximation to the function @xmath5 at finite @xmath6 , an _ extrapolation _ of the function @xmath23 to finite @xmath6 .",
    "now consider the limit @xmath24 . at large @xmath6 ,",
    "@xmath21 will scale with @xmath6 like @xmath25 so that @xmath26 the full ` strong - coupling ' ( large @xmath6 ) expression can now be obtained by writing @xmath27 with @xmath28 , and expanding @xmath29 in powers of @xmath30 , which for @xmath31 behaves like @xmath32 .",
    "the result is @xmath33\\ ] ] with @xmath34 the indices @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the expansion ( [ eqn2 ] ) are now chosen so as to give the correct asymptotic behaviour ( i.e. the correct powers of @xmath6 ) in the strong - coupling expansion ( [ eqn7 ] ) , which we assume is known _",
    "a priori_. the leading coefficient @xmath37 in ( [ eqn5a ] ) is found by searching for the extrema of the leading coefficient @xmath38 as a function of @xmath37 and choosing the smallest of them .",
    "finally , we have to account for the fact that @xmath21 will have corrections to the leading behaviour @xmath39 .",
    "we can allow for this by replacing @xmath37 by @xmath40 requiring a re - expansion of the coefficients @xmath41 in ( [ eqn8 ] ) .",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath42 are determined by looking for the turning points of @xmath43 , successively .",
    "the equations @xmath44 together with knowledge of the coefficients @xmath45 , can in principle be used to determine a set of parameters @xmath46 , and hence estimate the leading strong - coupling coefficients @xmath41 .",
    "this provides estimates of the _ asymptotic behaviour _ of the function @xmath5 . in the case of the strong - coupling anharmonic oscillator",
    ", it has been shown@xcite that the resulting estimates converge exponentially fast , and have been used to estimate the energy eigenvalue in the strong - coupling limit accurate to 20 decimal places !    alternatively , any knowledge of the strong - coupling coefficients @xmath47 can be fed back into the set of equations ( [ eqn8 ] ) and ( [ eqn11 ] ) to obtain estimates of further weak - coupling coefficients @xmath48 , and thus carry the extrapolation @xmath49 to higher orders .",

    "our object now is to see whether these series can be accurately extrapolated to the continuum limit , which corresponds to @xmath60 or @xmath1 , using the feynman - kleinert approach .      for the ground state energy per site @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the number of states , the series expansion is of the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 ; and the asymptotic behaviour as @xmath1 is known@xcite @xmath65 the coefficients @xmath66 have been calculated up to order @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "in this case , we can apply the formalism of section [ sec2 ] , taking @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , which implies the asymptotic behaviour as @xmath1 @xmath72    fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the resulting approximants to the ground - state energy at @xmath73 compared with numerical results obtained by other methods , and the known continuum limit , eq . ( [ eqn19 ] ) .",

    "the energy gap to the lowest - lying positronium state has an expansion @xmath74 and the expected asymptotic behaviour as @xmath1 is @xmath75 the coefficients @xmath66 for this series have been calculated up to order @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "here , we take @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath77 , assuming the asymptotic behaviour as @xmath1 @xmath78 which accords with previous studies@xcite . in this case , however , the feynman - kleinert approximants do not converge at all at large @xmath0 .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the dependence of the estimated value of @xmath79 as a function of the parameter @xmath80 , for the case @xmath73 , at various orders @xmath7 .",
    "it can be seen that as @xmath80 increases , the estimate of @xmath79 comes in from infinity , oscillates around the correct value ( marked by a solid line ) , and then slowly drifts away again .",
    "unfortunately , the oscillations increase with order @xmath7 , and the values at the lowest turning point correspondingly diverge away from the correct value as @xmath7 increases .",
    "the same is true of the values at the lowest point of inflection .",
    "it seems that the feynman - kleinert approximant method fails in this case .",
    "another problem connected with series expansions for the schwinger model arises in connection with the continuum field theory , rather than the lattice model .",
    "a few coefficients are known of the series expansions for the lowest - lying excited states of the model , the `` vector '' and `` scalar '' positronium states , in both the strong - coupling and weak - coupling regimes . at strong coupling , @xmath81 ,",
    "the first three coefficients have been computed by adam@xcite , using the bosonic form of the theory : @xmath82 at weak coupling , @xmath83 , the first three coefficients have been calculated by sriganesh _",
    "@xcite , following a treatment of coleman @xcite : @xmath84^n .\\ ] ]    the problem now is , how can one compute a sensible interpolation between these two series to obtain accurate estimates of the energy eigenvalues at finite @xmath2 ?",
    "one possibility is to use `` 2-point '' pad approximants : but they involve only integer powers of the variable , @xmath85 in this case . by fitting an appropriate power of the function",
    "@xmath86 one can mimic the leading behaviour as @xmath83 , but can not reproduce the sub - leading powers .",
    "furthermore , experience shows that 2-point pad approximants are prone to exhibit spurious ` wiggles ' at intermediate couplings between the two limits . here",
    "we set out to apply feynman - kleinert approximants to the problem .",
    "setting @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , we have computed feynman - kleinert approximants for the energy eigenvalues using known values for the coefficients @xmath90 for @xmath91 . now knowing @xmath92 coefficients in total allows us to estimate the next @xmath7 coefficients for either the @xmath66 or @xmath93 series .",
    "table [ tab1a ] shows the ` predicted ' values versus the known values for @xmath94 . for the vector state with @xmath95 ,",
    "the predicted values are in quite good agreement with the known values , to within a few percent . at @xmath96 ( see table [ tab1b ] ) , however , a large discrepancy becomes evident between the predicted and ` known ' values for the coefficient @xmath97 - even the sign is different .",
    "this prompted us to re - examine the calculation of the weak - coupling coefficients @xmath93 by sriganesh _",
    "et al._@xcite ; and indeed we discovered some errors in those calculations . a corrected version of the calculations is given in the appendix ;",
    "the corrected series coefficients are also shown in table [ tab1b ] .",
    "for the scalar state , the ` predicted ' series coefficients disagree with the known ones even at @xmath94 - but this is easily understood , in that the simplest interpolation between the zeroth order series at either end would have no ` hump ' in the middle such as is shown in fig .",
    "the predicted values at @xmath98 agree qualitatively with the ( corrected ) known values .",
    "the feynman - kleinert approximants were found to give smooth and apparently accurate interpolations of the energy eigenvalues at finite @xmath2 , up to order @xmath99 . at order @xmath100 ,",
    "no solution was found to the system of simultaneous equations - we have not explored in detail why this occurred .",
    "figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] show the results for the vector and scalar state interpolations . for the vector state energies ,",
    "our interpolation is compared to data obtained from the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method @xcite , the `` fast moving frame '' estimates of krger and scheu @xcite , and the `` renormal - ordered '' mass perturbation series results of adam @xcite .",
    "the scalar state interpolations are compared to the finite lattice calculations of sriganesh _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and again results of krger and scheu , and adam .",
    "both plots show excellent agreement between the interpolation and the numerical data , within errors .",
    "we also plot the second order strong and weak coupling series used to generate the interpolation on the same plots , which diverge away for large and small masses respectively .",
    "the `` renormal - ordered '' expansion @xcite about @xmath73 , extends the region of validity of the perturbation theory , and agrees fairly well with our interpolation for small masses .",
    "the interpolation performs particularly well for the scalar state , where for small @xmath2 , the original strong coupling series disagrees significantly with the numerical data .",
    "the interpolation on the other hand agrees extremely well with existing results , despite the large gap that must be bridged between the two series .",
    "tables [ tab3a ] and [ tab3b ] list numerical values for specific values of @xmath2 for the interpolation compared to previous works .",
    "we estimate the error on our interpolations based on the difference between our quoted @xmath98 calculation and the corresponding @xmath94 calculation .",
    "error estimates have probably been overestimated somewhat using this method , as can be seen from the good agreement with the numerical data in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "we have not however found a better way of estimating these errors .",
    "the feynman - kleinert approximants have earned a mixed scorecard in the applications we have discussed . for the extrapolation of lattice strong - coupling series to the weak - coupling continuum limit , the approximants have basically failed .",
    "they converged for the ground - state eigenvalue , but only slowly ; and for the first excited state eigenvalue , they did not converge at all .",
    "this is probably due to the presence of exponentially decaying terms corresponding to essential singularities in the weak - coupling limit , which are not accounted for in the feynman - kleinert approach .",
    "the upshot is , unfortunately , that this approach does not seem to have any advantage over previous techniques@xcite , which used pad or integral approximants to extrapolate to intermediate couplings , and then ` matched ' the results onto a weak coupling form to reach the continuum limit .",
    "for the continuum field theory , however , the feynman - kleinert approximants have proved useful in providing a sensible and apparently accurate interpolation between the known weak coupling and strong coupling series .",
    "the fact that we were able to pick up a mistake in the series coefficients by this approach adds confidence in the technique .",
