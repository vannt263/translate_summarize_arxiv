    "see @xcite .    on the other hand integrability or not of a given mechanical system remains as an non answered question .",
    "since krylov s work @xcite many researchers have transformed the mechanical problem of the motion of a particle in a given potential into a billiard problem @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by writing the jacobi metric associated to the given potential . in this approach , the motion is geodesic .",
    "the jacobi manifold is specifically obtained to incorporate the effects of the fields .    in the cosmological context",
    "it is the geometry itself the more fundamental field .",
    "the geodesic motion of particles , follow directly from the covariant divergence of the energy momuntum tensor @xcite .",
    "a few years ago cornish et al suggested that the chaotic motion of particles in a closed negatively curved manifold as a possible mechanism responsible for the homogenization of the universe @xcite .    in 1839",
    "it was discovered by jacobi itself , that the geodesic motion on an ellipsoid is integrable @xcite .",
    "jacobi used a particular coordinate system @xcite , now known as jacobi elliptical coordinates , and obtained an independent , and involutive constant of the motion . in 1994 , knieper and weiss @xcite proved that there are many smooth riemannian metrics on @xmath1 with chaotic geodesic flows .",
    "the authors consider arbitrary small deviations of the metric on the ellipsoid .",
    "then , the melnikov method is used to prove the existence of an homoclinic point .",
    "the purpose of this article is to provide a concrete example of two manifolds topologically equivalent to a sphere .",
    "the geodesics are investigated using the technique of the poincar surface of section .",
    "section [ s2 ] includes a very brief discussion of the gauss - bonnet theorem , for more details see @xcite . in section [ s1 ] the geodesic motion of the given manifold",
    "is apparently integrable . in section [ s2 ]",
    "the geodesic flow on the manifold shows the presence of chaotic regions , which are related to the domains of negative curvature .",
    "anyway , in the conclusions it is stressed that a closed space with domains of negative curvature is not a mandatory condition for chaotic geodesic motion .",
    "this manifold is obtained as the immersion of a closed surface in the euclidean space @xmath2 . as is well known",
    ", the spherical harmonics @xmath3 form a complete base for any function defined on @xmath1 . in this work , the following class of surfaces @xmath4 is considered .",

    "[ f1 ] , with @xmath7.,width=188,height=151 ]    given a geodesic lagrange function @xmath11 the hamiltonian follows @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the momenta conjugate do the velocity @xmath14 . for the case of interest",
    "we have @xmath15 where @xmath7 and @xmath16 is given by the equation ( [ imersao ] ) .",
    "following a. saa and j. szczsny and t. dobrowolski @xcite we quote here the geodesic deviation equations @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the riemann tensor for the metric in ( [ metrica ] ) . which in fermi coordinates @xmath19 , @xmath20 is in the direction of the velocity vector @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the orthogonal separation between neighboring geodesics @xmath24 where @xmath25 is gauss s curvature of the surface .",
    "the gaussian curvature @xmath25 of a surface , is given by the ratio of the determinant of the second fundamental form , by the first fundamental form .",
    "the relation between the gaussian curvature and the riemann scalar is very simple @xmath26 if the curvature is positive @xmath27 , we can see that the solutions of ( [ dgeodesico ] ) do not diverge .",
    "the poincar section for the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltoniano ] ) with @xmath7 , is shown in fig [ int ] .",
    "the intersection surface is set to @xmath28 and the constant hamiltonian , with @xmath29 shows a cumulative error in one part in @xmath30 .",
    "apparently the motion is integrable .",
    "the immersed surface is very similar as the one in the last section , given by ( [ imersao ] ) ; the difference is that now @xmath31 .",
    "the metric is the same ( [ metrica ] ) , with @xmath31 , and the hamiltonian also , ( [ hamiltoniano ] ) , with @xmath31 .     in ( [ imersao ] ) is chosen . ]",
    "the gauss - bonnet theorem relates the integrated gaussian curvature to the euler number of the surface @xmath32 , for more details see @xcite .",
    "it is connected to the degree of the application @xmath33 , where @xmath34 have the same dimension @xmath35 and @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xmath38 where the @xmath39 are the pre images of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 . in this work , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is given by ( [ imersao ] ) .",
    "first , in an appropriate local coordinate system the metric on any surface @xmath45 , and the gaussian curvature coincides with the jacobian @xmath46 . for the unit sphere , @xmath1 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the surface element .",
    "the above integral is a topological invariant .",
    "remind that the second fundamental form can be diagonalized . for minimum points of the height function",
    "the principal curvatures are @xmath50 and @xmath27 , for maximum points of the height function @xmath51 and @xmath27 while for saddle points @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ genus ] that the degree of @xmath54 for , a)@xmath55 , b)@xmath56 , c)@xmath57 , that is , each hole contributes with a @xmath58 term .        since ( [ imersao ] ) is a map from @xmath59 @xmath60 where the genus @xmath61 is the number of holes in the manifold @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are the surface elements on @xmath1 and @xmath62 respectively .",
    "of course , both manifolds in this work , have @xmath0 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] and fig .",

    "the intersection surface is set to @xmath28 and the constant hamiltonian , with @xmath29 shows a cumulative error in one part in @xmath30 .",

    "the jacobi manifold is specifically obtained to incorporate the effects of the fields .",
    "there has been an attempt to establish a local criteria for chaos .",
    "in particular a. saa @xcite shows an example of chaos occurring in a strictly positive curvature space , @xmath27 .",
    "j. szczsny and t. dobrowolski in @xcite show an example of an integrable system with @xmath53 , namely the classical scattering kepler problem . in the above",
    "mentioned examples the manifolds are not closed .",
    "this result is in contrast to the geodesic motion on @xmath1 , @xmath47 which is integrable , and on the genus @xmath64 torus , @xmath65 which is strongly chaotic @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ caos ] , we believe that the presence of geodesic chaos in the closed manifold given fig . [ f2 ] occurs due to the regions with @xmath53 . and in fig .",
    "[ int ] the geodesic flow is apparently integrable , and the curvature @xmath27 is positive everywhere . the fact that a given closed boundary less space has positive and negative curvature regions does not imply that the geodesic motion is chaotic , as we discuss in the following .",
