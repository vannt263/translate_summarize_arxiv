    "the discovery of the @xmath0 , 93  min orbit , `` black widow '' ( bw ) pulsar psr  j1311 - 3430 in gamma - rays @xcite comes to increase the number of such systems in a very interesting fashion .",
    "this is the first time that gamma - ray pulsations led to an identification without the need of low - energy counterparts , and additional work @xcite indicated the absence or very low level of h in the companion , plus the suggestive evidence of a large mass of the pulsar itself .",
    "these facts are quite important to reconstruct the evolutionary path that led to the present state .    in a former work",
    "@xcite we have modelled a similar system , namely the binary millisecond pulsar psr  j1719 - 1438 in a 2.2  h orbit featuring a very low mass companion @xcite .",
    "we shall show now that the additional information gathered from psr  j1311 - 3430 is useful to refine the models and restrict the possible initial states to a rather small range , for a given assumed value of the initial donor mass .",
    "we have described the features and tests of the evolutionary code employed in these studies elsewhere ( see @xcite ; and references therein ) . a simultaneous integration of the stellar structure , mass transfer rate ( if any ) and orbit evolution is performed taking into account i ) _ accretion _ onto the neutron star ( ns ) ; ii ) the _ evaporating wind _ driven by the pulsar radiation ; and iii ) the _ irradiation feedback _ , present when the donor star that transfers mass onto the ns and accretion illuminates the donor star modifying its evolution ( see for further details on this item ) .",
    "the three effects have been shown to be important for the evolution of psr  j1719 - 1438 .",
    "the case of psr  j1311 - 3430 adds considerable new information to address because spectroscopic / photometric data has shown that h is almost absent @xcite , at the level of a number abundance @xmath1 in contrast with other members of the group for a helium - dominated composition . ] ; and also that a high - mass for the pulsar is favoured , depending somewhat on the interpretation of the light curve but bounded by @xmath2 .",
    "we shall show now that the evolutionary models can match these and the rest of the observed parameters , constraining quite tightly the initial state of the system .",
    "the evolution of psr  j1311 - 3430 system has been modelled within the same scenario depicted in @xcite starting with a normal , solar composition star and a just - formed ns orbiting together with an initial period @xmath3  d.    when the donor star radius @xmath4 equals the radius of the roche lobe @xmath5 , it occurs the onset of the roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) . around this epoch",
    "tidal dissipation forces quickly circularise the orbit .",
    "the donor star transfers mass across the lagrangian point @xmath6 towards the ns , causing the orbit to evolve . as in @xcite",
    ", we have parametrized the uncertain fraction of mass effectively accreted by the ns with a quantity @xmath7 ( that is , @xmath8 ) , assuming that it is always below the eddington limit @xmath9 . since",
    ", in general , @xmath10 some material is lost from the system , carrying away specific angular momentum of the secondary .",
    "fortunately , the value of @xmath11 is not critical in determining the evolution of this kind of systems @xcite , and so we have assumed an average value of @xmath12 .",
    "gravitational radiation @xcite and magnetic braking are known to provide relevant angular momentum sinks .",
    "additionally , the @xmath13 due to rlof has been described by the expressions given in .",
    "as stated in @xcite , this `` standard '' prescription valid for lmxbs @xcite must be supplemented with a wind evaporation @xmath14 law . here , we shall assume the expressions given by @xcite , namely    @xmath15    where the spin down luminosity @xmath16 of the pulsar is given by @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the moment of inertia of the ns , @xmath19 is its period and @xmath20 its spin - down rate ) , @xmath21 is the escape velocity from the donor star surface , @xmath22 is the semi - axis of the circular orbit and @xmath23 is an efficiency factor . as in @xcite , we shall set @xmath24 . while irradiation feedback is a fundamental ingredient in computing the mass transfer evolution at early stages , we have found that it does not affect the evolutionary path of the system in the mass - orbital period plane . as we are interested here on the final evolution of the system , in this letter we shall neglect irradiation feedback .",
    "the evolution of the system has been computed with our detailed ( henyey ) evolutionary code described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we started with a fiducial donor mass of @xmath25 together with a @xmath26 ns , as in the case of psr  j1719 - 1438 .",
    "the range of initial donor masses is bounded from below by the isolated - star evolution timescale ( @xmath27 ) , which should be short enough to allow for the onset of mass transfer ; and from above by @xmath28 , because above that initial value the mass transfer is unstable @xcite . as in the case of the evolution of psr  j1719 - 1438",
    ", @xmath29 must be very short .",
    "however , extremely short @xmath29 would cause the mass transfer to start at the zams ; while too long @xmath29 values would render a detached wide orbit after a few @xmath30 , not the observed bw - type system .    even if these conditions are essentially the same as the ones we studied for psr  j1719 - 1438 , the strong upper limit set by @xcite on the h abundance allows an important refinement of the models .",
    "its solution rests on a delicate interplay between the dynamical evolution of the close binary system ( cbs ) and the structure of the donor star in a novel fashion , described as follows .",
    "if the system started at low periods , around @xmath31  d , mass transfer starts when h core abundance is @xmath32 . from this initial condition on",
    ", @xmath33 drops slowing down h - burning . when @xmath34 the star becomes completely convective making it chemically homogeneous up to the photosphere with @xmath35 . since for a larger @xmath29",
    "the onset of the rlof occurs later , @xmath36 will have a lower value and @xmath37 gets smaller .",
    "eventually , there is a @xmath29 value @xmath38  d for which @xmath39 , this condition holding for every period longer than that .",
    "for this kind of cbss , there exists a bifurcation period value @xmath40 : if @xmath41 the cbs evolves to an open configuration forming a low - mass helium white dwarf , while @xmath42 leads to the kind of bw systems we are interested in . for @xmath42 ,",
    "the minimum orbital period attained during evolution decreases when @xmath29 increases the star has a higher mean molecular weight @xmath43 .",
    "the star attains a partially degenerate interior at larger densities , a smaller roche lobe and consequently a shorter orbital period .",
    "partial degeneracy is a necessary condition for the orbit of the system to start to evolve to larger periods . ] .",
    "this behaviour can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : periodos ] , where for the system considered here the bifurcation period is between 0.880 and 0.890  d.    for @xmath44 there occur conditions for which @xmath39 and mass transfer is able to remove most of h - rich outer layers .",
    "the donor star becomes a very low - mass he star .",
    "remarkably , such configuration leads to masses and orbital period in excellent agreement with observations .",
    "this tight interval 0.87  @xmath45  0.90 for psr  j1311 - 3430 is the only interval accepted in these calculations , a shorter @xmath29 would produce h - rich bw systems .",
    "these features are clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : abundancias ] .",
    "we would like to emphasise that a large value of the pulsar mass @xcite is a natural outcome of the evolution calculations , here restricted to a reasonable but uncertain initial value set to @xmath46 for definiteness .",
    "the evolution of the ns ( pulsar ) and donor star masses are depicted in fig .  [ fig : masas ] .",
    "the final value of the ns mass is not sensitive to @xmath29 as expected , and reflects the integrated accretion over the system lifetime .",
    "while values @xmath47 result , it should be kept in mind that the accretion efficiency parametrised by @xmath11 was held fixed at 0.5 in all the calculation .",
    "a detailed modelling of the accretion could refine this rough time - average and eventually push the mass to higher values without any serious conflict with present observations .",
    "however , the problem of explaining the presence of very massive ns in these systems would call @xcite for a major revision of current ns core microphysics ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : periodos_t ] we show the period evolution for the considered cbss .",
    "this figure , complementary of fig .",
    "[ fig : periodos ] , provides the time scale involved in the evolution of the cbss . finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : radios ] we show the evolution of the radius of the donor star and its corresponding roche lobe for @xmath48  d , which represents a good model for psr  j1311 - 3430 .    in table",
    "[ tabla : datos ] we present some relevant quantities for each of the computed models . from that",
    ", we see that all models with @xmath49 reproduce the main characteristics of bw systems .",
    "particularly , the system containing the pulsar psr  j1311 - 3430 is best represented by models with @xmath50  d , just below the bifurcation value .",
    "let us briefly address the effect of the present uncertainties in the ingredients of the model .",
    "the value of @xmath29 favoured for the occurrence of psr j1311 - 3430 is dependent on the strength of the magnetic braking .",
    "we have tested it by introducing a factor lower than one in the standard expression .",
    "if the strength is half of the standard one , the whole scenario is essentially unchanged ; the favoured period is 0.76  d and companions to bws without h are possible .",
    "however if magnetic braking were four times less efficient it is still possible to find systems with the observed period but in all cases the companion retains some h. thus , if so , a model for psr j1311 - 3430 would be not possible .",
    "regarding the value of the parameter @xmath51 , work in progress shows that if it were larger than assumed here , the qualitative behaviour of the evolution would be essentially the same , but the final evolution to large orbital periods would be markedly faster posing no problem for the whole model .    performing a detailed calculation of the probability of having bws without ( or trace ) h is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , in order to make some preliminary estimations , we have computed several models for the range of periods that evolve to bw configuration .",
    "we found that for a standard magnetic braking , systems evolving to bw have @xmath52 ; being @xmath53 for @xmath54 ( @xmath55 for @xmath56 ) .",
    "meanwhile , for the case of magnetic braking with half of the standard strength , the range of @xmath57 evolving to bws is @xmath58 ; being @xmath59 for @xmath54 ( @xmath60 for @xmath56 ) .",
    "so , if the initial distribution of @xmath57 were uniform , we would have 6% of the bws with @xmath56 and 3% with @xmath54 for both , the standard magnetic braking strength and a half of it .",
    "a new path for cbss evolving into millisecond pulsar - very low mass companion final states has been studied and applied to the case of psr  j1719 - 1438 in @xcite . in this letter , we have applied the same ideas to the latest member just discovered in gamma - rays @xcite , namely the system psr  j1311 - 3430 .",
    "these self - consistent calculations including all three essential ingredients ( accretion , winds and illumination ) show that theory is able to account for the formation of bw systems with he - dominated donor composition on a few @xmath30 timescale .",
    "the initial conditions for the particular case of psr  j1311 - 3430 are tightly bound from below by the requirement that @xmath61 , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : abundancias ] .",
    "we also assert that the same evolution leading the system to the observed region of @xmath62 plane produces a high - mass pulsar as indicated by dedicated observations by @xcite . figs .  [ fig : periodos]-[fig : radios ] display the evolution of the system at a glance .",
    "we have finally checked that a variation of the initial donor mass @xmath63 within the whole interval leading to the bw track does not lead to dramatic changes in the initial periods , and that a bifurcation _ locus _ can be calculated quite accurately .",
    "work in progress devoted to the whole population of `` redbacks '' , wide binaries and bw millisecond pulsar systems @xcite is underway and will be published elsewhere ."
