    "this method was optimised for rydberg states around @xmath3 due to computational limitations as well as the accessible experimental data .",
    "the high accuracy of this method at low electric fields is always given by the accuracy of the unperturbed energy levels , which are used in the calculation .",

    "we then average the demodulated signal from the carrier and both sidebands .",
    "the additional frequency modulation decreases the signal strength on the carrier frequency and creates an even lower signal strength on the sidebands , but averaging the signal from three frequencies lowers the noise level at the same time . in total , the resulting signal - to - noise ratio is improved by a factor of as compared to a simple lock - in measurement without frequency modulation . for every set frequency of the coupling laser we ramp up the voltage on the plate capacitor using an auxiliary output of the lock - in amplifier ( zurich instruments , hf2li ) .",

    "we observe two background effects [ fig .",
    "[ fig:35s-1 - 2-th - exp - a ] , [ fig:70s-1 - 2-th - exp ] ] which are caused by the region of the cell that is not covered by the plate capacitor [ fig .",

    "the first is the line of the unperturbed state , which remains visible for all applied voltages because we probe those outer regions of the cell as well .",

    "could also arise from the dipole which is formed between adsorbed rubidium and the nickel surface of the capacitor plates . in previous experiments",
    "the repeated deposition of cold atom clouds of rubidium onto a copper surface led to electric fields close to the surface which saturated as the number of deposited clouds increased @xcite .",
    "since the work functions of nickel and copper are similar and the cell is filled with rubidium vapour at all times we may find a similar effect for the capacitor plates .",
    "this effect may play a role for rydberg states higher than @xmath2 at low electric fields , but is negligible for the measured data presented in this article , where the distance between the laser beams and the capacitor plates is .",

    "the hamiltonian for the valence electron in an alkali atom with an external electric field in z - direction can be written as @xmath27 in atomic units with @xmath28 the hamiltonian for the valence electron in absence of any perturbation , @xmath29 the electric field strength and @xmath30 the position operator in z - direction . for the following calculations we include the fine structure splitting in @xmath28 and neglect the hyperfine structure splitting as it is smaller than our frequency resolution in the experiment @xcite .",
    "the stark shifts of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 states from the eit scheme are negligible as well , as they amount to less than for the region of the field strength up to .",
    "we then create a matrix representation of @xmath31 in a subset of the basis given by @xmath28 .",
    "this way @xmath28 is represented by a diagonal matrix with the energy levels from @xcite on its diagonal .",
    "the matrix representation of @xmath30 is symmetric with only off - diagonal entries and in spherical coordinates we obtain from @xcite @xmath32 with the radial overlap integral @xmath33 in the first line of the right hand side . from the kronecker delta @xmath34",
    "we can see that the matrix representations of @xmath35 for different values of @xmath36 can be calculated separately .",
    "it is also evident that the stark shifts for @xmath37 are always equal .",
    "therefore we only calculate matrix representations for positive values of @xmath36 in this step .",
    "this reduces the computing time for diagonalising the matrices , but we need to consider states with both signs for the calculation of transition strengths later on again .    for the calculation of the overlap integrals we tried two different methods to calculate the radial wavefunctions for all states in the chosen subset of the basis and also for @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which will be used later on in the calculation of the measure for the transition strengths .",
    "one method was to further follow @xcite using their atomic potential for @xmath0rb and numerov s method to solve the radial schrdinger equation .",
    "we also tried using the parametric model potential from @xcite with another solving algorithm @xcite , which allowed us to obtain parts of the wavefunctions that are located further inside the ionic core .",
    "while the two methods lead to slightly different amplitudes of the wavefunctions due to normalisation , the differences in the stark shifts and transition strengths calculated from the two methods for the observed states lie below our experimental accuracy .",
    "all calculations presented in this work utilised the latter method .",
    "we can then calculate the matrix representations of the perturbed hamiltonians @xmath35 using equation and diagonalise them efficiently in parallel for different values of the electric field strength to obtain the energy eigenvalues . in this step",
    "we also calculate the eigenvector @xmath38 corresponding to every eigenvalue . with this",
    "we can further follow the method from @xcite to represent every stark shifted rydberg state @xmath39 as a linear combination of unperturbed states , given by the eigenvectors , and calculate the dipole matrix elements @xmath40 with @xmath41 the entry of @xmath38 that corresponds to the states @xmath42 . here",
    "we sum over all states in the selected subset of the basis given by the unperturbed states and both signs for each value of @xmath36 .",
    "for the calculation of the dipole matrix elements between the unperturbed rydberg states and @xmath43 we separate the radial and the angular parts of the wavefunctions .",
    "we use the radial overlap integrals from equation [ equ : z ] and calculate the three components of the angular overlap integrals following @xcite .",
    "we take into account the effect of the probe laser , which couples the different @xmath44 substates of @xmath45 and @xmath46 by calculating the weighting factors @xmath47 with @xmath48 the polarisation of the probe laser . in this step",
    "we assume that all @xmath44 substates of @xmath45 are evenly occupied .",
    "the weighting factors are then used to calculate the measure for the transition strength @xmath49 with @xmath50 the polarisation of the coupling laser . in the experiment",
    "the two lasers are counterpropagating and perpendicular to the external electric field with circular polarisations .",
    "therefore we use @xmath51 here . the measure for the transition strength @xmath26",
    "is used to determine the opacity gradients for the lines in fig .",

    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:70s-1 - 2-th - exp ] , the calculations run similarly with states and values of the electric field strength .",

    "the measurements were performed in frequency regions around s states , but since @xmath14 is not a good quantum number any more in the presence of an electric field @xcite , we find that other states with @xmath24 and @xmath25 are shifted far enough by the stark effect to appear within the measured frequency range .",
    "fig:35s-1 - 2-th - exp - a ] and [ fig:35s-1 - 2-th - exp - b ] show comparisons of the measured and numerically calculated stark maps for @xmath18 .",
    "the frequency axis shows the detuning of the coupling laser relative to the absolute value of the transition frequency from @xcite .",
    "a linear scaling with an offset has been applied to the electric field axis of the measured data . using only this scaling",
    "we achieve a match between calculated and measured energy levels for stark states in the whole range of our measurement .",
    "the lines in the calculated stark maps are drawn with an opacity gradient , resulting in a color range between white and the respective color associated with the different values for @xmath52 .",
    "the opacity gradient is scaled to @xmath26 from equation with an upper cutoff at of its maximum for better visibility .",
    "we find a good agreement between this calculated measure for the transition strength and the experimental data in the range of electric fields shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:35s-1 - 2-th - exp - a ] .",
    "the quality of the agreement deteriorates slightly approaching the classical ionisation threshold , but there is still good agreement beyond this point , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:35s-1 - 2-th - exp - b ] .",
    "the very weak signals we still find in the experimental data at electric fields around all correspond to calculated states with a strong calculated transition strength . considering this , we think that the method described here can be applied for these high electric field strengths , where only few states are still visible in the experimental data , as a way to select potentially interesting areas before a measurement .",
    "one important cause for discrepancies between the experimental and numerically calculated data we present here is that no ionisation effects were taken into account for the calculations .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that even though the calculated measure for the transition strength shows some differences at high electric fields , we still find a remarkable agreement of calculated and measured energy levels in this region of study .",
    "these differences could be related to the calculation of the radial wavefunctions .",
    "we calculate the radial wavefunctions for @xmath53 and @xmath54 using the same method as for rydberg states .",
    "evidently this works quite well here , but more accurate radial wavefunctions , especially for @xmath54 but also for rydberg states with low @xmath14 , could further improve the quality of the calculated transition strengths .",
    "this is further emphasised as the biggest discrepancies of the transition strengths at high electric fields can be found for states @xmath55 while states with @xmath56 show hardly any discrepancies on the whole range of electric fields . on the other hand , these discrepancies",
    "could also be explained by a stronger coupling of rydberg states with low @xmath14 to the continuum .",
    "some disagreements on the whole range of our measurements can also be caused by the scaling of the eit signal with the dipole matrix elements , which is only approximated by the squared scaling in @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , lines with small slopes and especially local extrema may appear over - pronounced in the experimental data .",
    "since these parts of the lines are broad in the electric field domain and the inhomogeneous electric field outside of the plate capacitor still lies within the volume of the cell , this results in an effective contribution of more atoms to the signal .",
    "we find a match similar to the one presented for @xmath18 in the energy levels and transition strengths for @xmath19 , which is shown in detail in fig .",
    "[ fig:70s-1 - 2-th - exp ] .",
    "discrepancies lie within the frequency resolution of for fig .",
    "[ fig:70s-1 - 2-th - exp ] , which is the highest accuracy we present here .",
    "the opacity gradients were assigned the same way as for @xmath18 .",
    "the calculated transition strengths match the experimental data equally well as for @xmath18 .",
    "the experimental data presented in figs .",
    "[ fig:35s-1 - 2-th - exp - a ] , [ fig:35s-1 - 2-th - exp - b ] and [ fig:70s-1 - 2-th - exp ] is provided as supplementary data to this article @xcite .",
    "all results presented in this work were measured and calculated in the energy range near @xmath12 states .",
    "however , they intrinsically include contributions all possible @xmath14 states due to the mixing of states caused by the external electric field .    for a possible extension of our measurements to a wider range of principal quantum numbers @xmath6 than the region between @xmath1 and @xmath2 ,",
    "the most important limiting factor is that the coupling of rydberg states to the intermediate @xmath11 grows weaker as @xmath6 increases , which leads to a lower signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "another factor influencing the signal - to - noise ratio is the density of the vapour , which on the other hand gives rise to collective effects which in turn cause undesired changes of the eit signal @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated agreement between measured and calculated stark maps of @xmath0rb up to an accuracy of .",
    "this agreement holds for the range from zero field to beyond the classical ionisation threshold and for principal quantum numbers @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "such data and calculations may aid the accurate mapping of electric fields at surfaces @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we presented numerical calculations to estimate the transition strength from low - lying states to stark shifted rydberg states .",
    "the results from these calculations show a very good agreement with our experimental data on a high range of electric fields and even beyond the classical ionisation threshold .    altogether , the methods presented in this paper can be used to find experimentally accessible stark shifted rydberg states with an appropriate sensitivity to external electric fields for a wide range of applications .",
    "for example , the dependence of the transition strength to different stark shifted rydberg levels could be used to determine not only the strength of an external electric field in an experimental system but also the electric field axis .",
