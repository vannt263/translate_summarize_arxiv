    "investigating the physical and chemical properties of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of dusty star - forming galaxies and/or high - redshift galaxies has been difficult , as typical uv / optical nebular lines are not useful due to heavy dust extinction and/or the lines are not accessible with conventional ground - based instruments .",
    "recently , the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) has opened a new window , allowing us to exploit fine structure lines at rest - frame far - infrared ( fir ) wavelengths to diagnose the ism properties for these galaxy populations ( e.g. , ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the [ cii ]  158  @xmath0 m ( @xmath9 ) is known to be the dominant coolant of the ism and one of the brightest lines from star - forming galaxies in the fir ( e.g. , ) . while the [ cii ] emission arises primarily from dense photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) , it is also observed in various regions / environments , including ionized regions , cool , diffuse interstellar gas , and shocked gas ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; ; @xcite ) . in order to characterize the [ cii ] emission and investigate the nature of the ism in star - forming galaxies at high redshift , ly@xmath1 blobs ( labs ) are a useful laboratory .",
    "labs are extended gaseous nebulae , preferentially found in regions of galaxy overdensities in the distant universe ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a large number of labs are associated with star - forming galaxies such as submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ; e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) , distant red galaxies ( drgs ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ; e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". thus labs are likely to be the sites of ongoing massive galaxy formation and assembly , and the extended gaseous structures around them are believed to be observational signs of large - scale gas flows ( inflow / outflow ) and their interactions as well as photoionization ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "ssa22-lab1 ( hereafter lab1 , @xcite ) is a giant lab discovered in the @xmath2 ssa22 proto - cluster region and one of the most well - studied labs ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "alma3 is spatially coincident with a drg at @xmath19 ( @xcite ) . while alma1 and alma2 do not have spectroscopic redshifts , their photometric redshifts and the low probability of chance association of alma sources suggest a physical association between the two alma sources and the giant ly@xmath1 nebula ( @xcite ; y. matsuda et al . in preparation ) .",

    "we also evaluated 3@xmath26 upper limits for the three rest - frame uv / optical galaxies with [ oiii ] line detections , by integrating the cube over 300  km  s@xmath12 at the source position ( table 1 ) .",
    "one striking characteristic of alma3 is the high [ cii]ir ratio seen in fig .",
    "[ ratio ] .",
    "while this ratio is known to decrease as ir luminosity increases ( `` [ cii ] deficit '' ) for local and high - redshift ir luminous galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , alma3 shows approximately an order of magnitude higher ratio ( fig .",
    "[ ratio ] ) at the same ir luminosity range ( this trend is independent of the uncertainties on @xmath69 described in  3.1 . while the @xmath6}/l_{\\rm ir}$ ] ratio may be @xmath703 lower , the increased corresponding @xmath69 keeps the trend . ) .",
    "the result implies different conditions responsible for [ cii ] emission between alma3 and the majority of previously known ir luminous galaxies .",
    "it has also been reported that some @xmath71 ulirgs show @xmath6}/l_{\\rm ir}$ ] ratios comparable to alma3 , although they have slightly higher @xmath69 than alma3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "one possible explanation for elevated [ cii]ir ratios is that the galaxies host widely spread star formation , and the uv radiation field is therefore diluted , which make the [ cii ] line a more efficient coolant ( see e.g. , ; @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the size of the dust continuum core in alma3 is 4.1  kpc , which is larger than a typical continuum size of bright smgs at similar redshifts ( 2.4  kpc ; @xcite ; see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this supports that a relatively extended star - forming region in alma3 contributes the high [ cii]/ir ratio for alma3 .",
    "gas accretion from the cosmic web is expected to accumulate a large amount of molecular gas necessary to fuel such widespread star formation ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have another clue from the [ cii ] 158  @xmath0m[nii ] 205  @xmath0 m line luminosity ratio , @xmath6}/l_\\textsc{[nii]}$ ] .",
    "alma3 shows one of the largest ratios ever reported ( fig .",
    "[ ratio ] ) .",
    "the @xmath6}/l_\\textsc{[nii]}$ ] ratio has been utilized to diagnose the ism conditions . in particular , it is used to evaluate global trend on the fraction of [ cii ] emission associated with ionized regions ( i.e. hii regions ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , mainly because nitrogen s ionization potential ( 14.5  ev ) is higher than that of hydrogen ( 13.6  ev ) so that [ nii ] arises only from ionized regions .",
    "@xcite reported the expected a line ratio @xmath6}/l_\\textsc{[nii]}\\approx3.5 $ ] , for hii regions with electron density of @xmath72  @xmath73 .",
    "if we adopt this estimate , it is expected that the contribution of ionized gas is only about @xmath156% and the vast majority of [ cii ] emission arises from the surface of dense pdrs and/or other regions / environments .",
    "the @xmath6}/l_\\textsc{[nii]}$ ] ratio is also sensitive to estimate gas metallicity ( e.g. , ; ; @xcite ) . suggests that the line ratio increases as metallicity decreases , considering both pdrs and hii regions in their model .",
    "the measured ratio , @xmath6}/l_\\textsc{[nii]}>55 $ ] , favors sub - solar metallicity for the variety of densities and ionization parameters in their model .",
    "gas accretion from the outside of alma3 may explain this relatively low metallicity .",
    "it is suggested that nitrogen may dominantly be in its doubly ionized state in high ionization conditions with lower dust shielding ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this effect is unlikely to be significant in alma3 because it is detected in dust continuum .",
    "although it is not straightforward to identify the origin of [ cii ] emission more , together with these clues , the properties and location of alma3 may support the importance of shock on the elevated [ cii ] emission .",
    "recently some work has suggested that mechanical heating due to turbulence in shocks can contribute to [ cii ] emission at high redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ; ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , @xcite reported that the resolved shocked regions of stephan s quintet have exceptionally high [ cii]fir ratio and they also suggest that this could be commonplace for high - redshift galaxies .",
    "@xcite suggested that a variety of shocks , originating from major - merger , intergalactic gas accretion , and stellar outflows , might contribute to the elevated [ cii ] emission .",
    "alma3 shows complicated rest - frame uv morphologies and [ cii ] velocity structures ( fig .",
    "[ cii_map ] ) , which is suggestive of galaxy - galaxy interaction ( dust obscuration may also contribute to it ) .",
    "alma3 hosts intense star - formation activity , as the dust continuum detection shows , and appears to be a relatively evolved system with large stellar mass @xmath74 ( @xcite ) comparable to the derived dynamical mass ( we need to recognize both estimates contain large uncertainties ) .",
    "therefore galactic outflow may interact with intergalactic gas stream ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus shock heating might be a contributor of [ cii ] emission from alma3 .",
    "one key question is the role of environment , since alma3 is located within a giant lab , ssa22-lab1 .",
    "lab1 resides in a remarkable proto - cluster and is associated with a number of star - forming galaxies , which may reflect the abundant gas accretion from cosmic web .",
    "the overdensity of galaxies may lead a high frequency of galaxy - galaxy interaction .",
    "therefore the unique environment might account for the relatively strong [ cii ] line .",
    "on the other hand , if alma1 and alma2 are actually at redshifts similar to confirmed lab1 members , the absence of detectable [ cii ] would mean diversity of the ism state within a lab . while we detected the [ cii ] line from a massive , dusty star - forming galaxy , much deeper observations of fir lines like [ cii ] and [ nii ] toward a giant lab at @xmath75 , which allows us to assess the ism state in uv / optical selected galaxies ( e.g. , lbgs like c11 in lab1 ) ,",
    "is highly expected .",
    "such surveys will give us an opportunity to estimate how the ism in the galaxies evolve in biased regions in the early universe , through the comparison with other fir line observations of galaxies in a biased region ( e.g. , aztec3 and lbg1 at @xmath76 ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) or galaxies in general environment in the same era .",
