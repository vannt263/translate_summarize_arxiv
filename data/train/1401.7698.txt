    "the most basic form of a poisson manifold is realized by symplectic geometry , in which case the hamiltonian mechanics is said to be _",

    "contrary to usual constants of motion that pertain to symmetries of a specific hamiltonian , there are _ topological constraints _ that are independent of the choice of a hamiltonian and are due to the poisson bracket alone . among various topological constraints ,",
    "casimir elements have special importance .",
    "we call the level - set of a casimir element a _ casimir leaf _ , on which equilibrium points or statistical equilibrium distributions may have interesting bifurcated structures , even when the hamiltonian is simple . since the transformation of a hamiltonian @xmath7 to an _ energy - casimir function _",

    "similarly , the gibbs distribution on a casimir leaf is given by @xmath12 , which can be regarded as a grand - canonical distribution function ( @xmath11 is a chemical potential)@xcite .",
    "we note that the equilibrium or the gibbs distribution function of a canonical hamiltonian system can be nontrivial only when the hamiltonian is a bumpy function , but this is not the case for a weakly coupled system like a usual fluid or a plasma .    in the context of the present study , we highlight another distinction of casimir elements among topological constraints . in @xcite , we proffered an interpretation of a casimir element as an _",
    "adiabatic invariant _ associated with a hidden `` microscopic '' angle variable . adding the angle variable to the phase space , we ` alchemized ' the casimir element into an action variable , which together with the angle variable forms a canonical pair .",
    "then , perturbing the hamiltonian by the new canonical variables , we unfroze the casimir element .",
    "by this theory , we extended the scope of ideal hamiltonian mechanics to see what happens when the orbit is allowed to deviate from the leaves of the poisson manifold .",
    "a finite dissipation may break the ideal constraints and free the orbit to move among different leaves when a very small dissipation that does not destroy the basic structure of the poisson manifold is considered ( as opposed to large dissipation that diminishes the `` dimension '' of the dynamics ) .",
    "thus , ideal constraints can be removed , giving rise to some instabilities .    in this work ,",
    "we formulate a general systematic method for embedding a poisson manifold into a higher - dimensional phase space and , in doing so , express the topological constraints ( restricting important instabilities omitted in the ideal model ) in terms of casimir elements of the embedded system .",
    "this idea is motivated by early work @xcite in which it was observed that adding additional variables to a noncanonical hamiltonian theory enriched the casimir structure and made available more general equilibria for the energy - casimir method .",
    "the idea was later used explicitly in the vlasov - poisson context in @xcite , and our method of embedding is a special case of the general theory of extensions given in @xcite .",
    "specifically , we introduce a _ mock field _ by which a local topological constraint ( which can not be elucidated by the original casimir elements ) is represented as a casimir element , a _ cross helicity _ pertinent to the mock field ( the reader is referred to @xcite for the original idea of unifying topological invariants as cross helicities ) . then , the mock field is the target to be perturbed when one wishes to break topological constraints .",

    "alternatively this law can be viewed as a rephrasing of kelvin s circulation law with the magnetic field replacing the vorticity .",
    "therefore , tearing modes , which grow by creating magnetic islands , are forbidden in an ideal plasma@xcite . here",
    "we show that the magnetic flux on a co - moving surface is the cross helicity pertinent to a lie - dragged _ _ pure - state__@xcite mock field .",

    "the equilibrium has zero velocity ( @xmath261 ) , constant enthalpy ( @xmath262 ) , and a magnetic field satisfying @xmath311 where @xmath297 is the hyper - function stemming from the resonant singularity .",
    "the solution gives the tearing - mode equilibrium .",
    "note , as discussed above , we can unfreeze the singular cross helicity @xmath273 by making a canonical pair with an angle variable ( see sec.[subsec : canonization ] ) .",
    "by embedding a poisson manifold of a noncanonical hamiltonian system into a higher - dimensional phase space , we can delineate topological structures within a simpler picture .",
    "for example , we showed that the topological constraint on magnetic field lines in an ideal plasma , alfven s magnetic frozen - in law ( or vortex lines in a neutral fluid , kelvin s circulation law ) , is not described by a foliation of the poisson manifold because these constraints are not _ integrable _ to define casimir leaves .",
    "however , by introducing a _ mock field _ and embedding the mhd system in a higher - dimensional phase space , we found that the local magnetic fluxes are represented as casimir elements ( cross helicities coupling the magnetic field and the mock field ) .",
    "we have also elucidated the underlying banach algebra describing the poincar duality of the mock field and chains determining the local flux ( or circulation ) .",
    "the representation of a topological constraint by a casimir element has an immense advantage in studying the global structure of the poisson manifold .",
    "this is especially true for studying _ singularities _ on the manifold ( where the rank of the poisson operator changes ) where different leaves intersect or new leaf bifurcations take place . for a poisson operator that is a differential operator ,",
    "the singularity in the phase space ( function space ) is related to the singularity in the base space of the operator , which yields singular ( hyperfunction ) solutions as kernel elements . in the example of ideal mhd , the _ resonance singularity _ yielded a current - sheet solution , and",
    "its integral defines a singular casimir element , by which a _ tearing - mode _ equilibrium bifurcates ( in the picture of ideal mhd , a tearing mode is stationary because of the flux constraint ) .",
    "the mock field was lifted into a physical field by a hamiltonian that includes it , while it is initially a mathematical artifact introduced to describe the poisson manifold in the higher - dimensional space . interpreting a casimir element as an _",
    "adiabatic invariant _ associated with a hidden `` microscopic '' angle variable , we extended the phase space by adding the angle variable to the original noncanonical system .",
    "then , the constancy of the casimir element was no longer due to the `` topological defect '' ( non - trivial kernel ) of the poisson operator , but due to the symmetry of the hamiltonian ( the newly added angle variable is , of course , ignorable in the hamiltonian ) .",
    "we then unfroze the casimir element and allowed it to be dynamic by perturbing the hamiltonian with a term dependent on the added angle variable .    as an explicit application of the formalism ,",
    "consider the following picture of the tearing - mode instability in a plasma .",
    "a tearing mode can be formulated as an equilibrium point on a helical - flux casimir leaf ( see @xcite ) . as long as the helical - flux is constrained",
    ", the tearing - mode can not grow . upon introducing a perturbation to change the helical flux , as well as to `` dissipate '' the energy , an unstable tearing mode can , then ,",
    "be formulated as a negative - energy perturbation that can grow by diminishing the energy . in this picture , the negative energy is absorbed by an `` external system '' through the pathway introduced by the new angle variable ; the extended phase space of the canonized hamiltonian system includes this `` external system '' so that the total energy remains conserved .",
    "we envision that many dissipation driven instabilities in fluids and plasma systems can be cast into this basic geometric picture .",
