    "<S> ( [ eqpi ] ) returns at the soft point ( @xmath84 ) the axial anomaly result ( [ g3pianomamp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the form factor normalized to the anomaly amplitude ( [ g3pianomamp ] ) , @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also convenient to re - express the scalar products @xmath78 through the mandelstam variables as defined by ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , while @xmath89 serves as the measure of virtuality of the third pion which may be off shell . </S>",
    "<S> the photon momentum is @xmath90 .    </S>",
    "<S> we obtained the expansion for @xmath91 to the order @xmath92 [ relative to the anomaly result ( [ g3pianomamp ] ) ] , but give eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqpi ] ) only to the order @xmath93 for brevity as the @xmath92-expansion for general @xmath94 is very lengthy . </S>",
    "<S> it will be given elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> however , below we do give @xmath77 to the order @xmath92 for the simpler special cases which are important for comparing our predictions with the experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> namely , one can take the photon to be on shell in all three pertinent experiments @xcite , in which at least two pion momenta , those of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , are also on the mass - shell . </S>",
    "<S> we thus set @xmath97 and @xmath98 , whereby @xmath99    in the primakoff measurements @xcite , including the one @xcite providing the only existing data point so far , the third pion is also on shell . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath100 , in which case we predict @xmath101    at cebaf @xcite , one takes data near @xmath102 , for which our @xmath103 expansion yields @xmath104 where the @xmath105 symmetry is lost due to the virtuality @xmath106 of the third pion .    our momentum expansions ( [ eqant ] ) and ( [ eqmisk ] ) show clearly that the main contribution to the term linear in @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( dominating the @xmath109-dependence close to the soft limit ) , comes from @xmath93 and not @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> this happens since the @xmath110-terms , due to the constraint ( [ oscond ] ) , contribute only to the part independent of @xmath107 and @xmath108 .    </S>",
    "<S> note that in the on - shell case ( [ eqant ] ) , the finite pion mass @xmath5 causes a larger upward shift than in the off - shell case ( [ eqmisk ] ) . for chiral pions ( @xmath111 ) and real photons the condition ( [ oscond ] ) becomes @xmath112 . for this case , but for general @xmath113 , the amplitude ( [ sumf ] ) becomes @xmath114 showing that the @xmath105 symmetry is restored in the chiral limit . </S>",
    "<S> the massless pion amplitude ( [ eqmisk2 ] ) is smaller than the one with @xmath115 mev by , typically , 4% when @xmath116 mev , by some ( depending on @xmath107 ) 6% when @xmath117 mev , by more than 10% when @xmath118 mev , _ </S>",
    "<S> etc_. it is interesting that for small @xmath107 and @xmath108 , the chiral - limit @xmath77 can fall slightly below its soft point value ( [ g3pianomamp ] ) when @xmath119 .    in the cebaf experiment @xcite , @xmath107 will vary more than @xmath108 . for the @xmath108-range relevant at cebaf </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath108-dependence of @xmath77 anyway turns out to be rather weak . for example , suppose one plots ( not done here to avoid overcrowding our figures ) the @xmath120 form factor ( [ eqmisk ] ) as a function of @xmath107 for several values of @xmath108 varying from @xmath121 to @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> ( take @xmath117 mev for definiteness . ) </S>",
    "<S> one would thus get , across the whole @xmath107-range relevant at cebaf , a narrow strip of tightly spaced curves , where the curve depicting @xmath123 for @xmath122 , would differ by just 2% to 3% from the curve with @xmath121 . in figs . 2 and 3 </S>",
    "<S> , we therefore show the dependence of @xmath77 ( for various cases ) on the variable @xmath107 , with @xmath108 fixed . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath113 changes sign when we put also the third pion off - shell as at cebaf @xcite , the amplitude is more sensitive to this change .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 we give our results at @xmath120 ( the @xmath113-value most relevant at cebaf @xcite ) for the constituent masses @xmath124 mev , 330 mev , 300 mev and @xmath118 mev . in fact </S>",
    "<S> , we show a pair of curves for each of these masses : one of the curves is obtained by exact numerical evaluation of the box amplitude , and the other corresponds to our series expansion to the order @xmath2 . at the lowest depicted @xmath107 , the form factor obtained by the accurate numerical calculation </S>",
    "<S> is ( for each @xmath10 ) slightly below the corresponding series expansion approximating it , but exceeds it eventually as @xmath107 grows . </S>",
    "<S> the convergence of the expansion is very satisfactory on the whole , since for @xmath125 , the agreement between the two ways of calculation is very good for all these values of @xmath10 . for @xmath126 , the exception </S>",
    "<S> are only the cases with unrealistically small @xmath10 , such as @xmath118 mev . for @xmath118 mev , we plot the curves up to @xmath127 only . </S>",
    "<S> namely , when @xmath107 reaches @xmath128 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , the threshold for production of an on - shell quark - antiquark pair , the ql approach becomes inadequate , because the amplitude starts being dominated by this threshold which is not physical but an artifact of the model ( [ 1leff ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ concerning the accuracy of the computations close to a threshold : the difficulty of numerical integration starts increasing gradually as one gets closer than @xmath129 to the threshold , while the accuracy of the @xmath92 expansion starts failing before that . ]    nevertheless , for the values of @xmath130 accessible at cebaf @xcite , such a threshold can not be reached unless @xmath131 mev . </S>",
    "<S> such values are , however , too low to serve as the constituent quark masses , which can not be much lighter than @xmath132 mev .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 we compare our ( numerically obtained ) on - shell predictions for various @xmath10 with the only existing experimental point so far @xcite , and with the predictions of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath21pt ) @xcite ( in holstein s @xcite renormalization convention  _ i.e. _ , we take his @xcite eq . </S>",

    "<S> ( 9 ) ] , and of vmd with the final pion rescattering included @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that our results agree rather well with vmd for constituent quark masses @xmath133 when @xmath134 . </S>",
    "<S> going down in @xmath107 , already at @xmath135 we agree rather well , but for somewhat higher @xmath10 ( 330 mev @xmath136 ) , with both vmd and @xmath21pt . </S>",
    "<S> for all @xmath107-values shown , our predictions get somewhat closer to those of @xmath21pt when the ratio @xmath137 gets smaller , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , for the largest considered constituent quark mass , @xmath138 mev . since @xmath21pt results in the weakest momentum dependence , its predictions for the largest values of @xmath107 accessible at cebaf are significantly different from both vmd and our ql ( @xmath21qm , @xmath1-model ) approach . </S>",
    "<S> the cebaf experiment should thus be able to distinguish between these various physical mechanisms in this range of momenta . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , all these approaches agree reasonably well for the lowest of @xmath107-values accessible at cebaf </S>",
    "<S> . in particular , our approach agrees with vmd and @xmath21pt that the existing data point @xcite is probably an overestimate , as we can fit it well ( _ e.g. _ , with the @xmath118 mev curve in fig . </S>",
