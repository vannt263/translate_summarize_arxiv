    "the two - dimensional layer of graphene is a most interesting object for the theoretical and experimental study of quantum phenomena .",
    "it has quite high mobility tunable by a gate voltage and a unique band structure similar to the energy spectrum of massless dirac fermions.@xcite such a quasi - relativistic nature of free carriers affects the transport phenomena including the weak localization .",
    "the weak localization ( antilocalization ) is caused by the constructive ( destructive ) interference of electron waves traveling in opposite directions.@xcite the interference is suppressed by an external magnetic field , which leads to a magnetoresistance in classically weak fields .",
    "the anomalous magnetoresistance in graphene is the subject of intensive experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite study during the last few years .",
    "it was experimentally shown that increasing the carrier density and decreasing the temperature leads to a transition from weak antilocalization to weak localization in graphene.@xcite such a behavior is attributed to the trigonal warping of electron spectra in valleys , which suppresses antilocalization , and intervalley scattering , which restores localization.@xcite    depending on the ratio between the magnetic length @xmath0 and the mean free path @xmath1 one distinguishes between two regimes of weak localization . in very low magnetic fields ( @xmath2 ) ,",
    "the main contribution to the magnetoresistance comes from large diffusion - like trajectories of electrons with the size @xmath3 .",
    "this is the diffusion regime of weak localization . with the field increase ( @xmath4 ) , the role of large trajectories",
    "is suppressed and the weak - localization correction to conductivity is determined by electron trajectories with few scatterers .",
    "such a non - diffusion regime is realized in high - mobility structures at rather small magnetic fields.@xcite to correctly extract kinetic parameters of carriers , such as the phase breaking time , from the magnetoresistance measurements one has to analyze experimental data in the whole range of classically weak magnetic fields .",
    "previous calculations of magnetoresistance in graphene were carried out only for the diffusion regime though experimental data in ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that the magnetic length may reach the mean free path in the magnetic field as small as @xmath5mt .",
    "the goal of this work is to develop the theory of weak localization beyond the diffusion regime and derive the quantum correction to conductivity .",
    "the developed theory can be also applied to two - dimensional systems formed at surfaces of bulk topological insulators , such as bi@xmath6se@xmath7 , bi@xmath6te@xmath7 , and bi@xmath6te@xmath6se ( see refs .  [ , ] and references therein ) , and in hgte quantum wells of critical width.@xcite the excitations in these systems are described by the effective hamiltonian similar to one for the free carriers in graphene .",
    "we note that the dirac cones in graphene are situated at the @xmath8 points of the two - dimensional brillouin zone and degenerate in spin .",
    "in contrast , the similar energy spectrum of carriers in topological insulators is formed by spin - orbit interaction , with the dirac point being situated at the @xmath9 point of the two - dimensional brillouin zone .",
    "experimental data indicate that the magnetoresistance in bi@xmath6te@xmath7 ( ref .  ) and bi@xmath6si@xmath7 ( ref .  ) as well as in hgte quantum wells@xcite is positive ( antilocalization ) as expected for massless dirac fermions .",
    "technically , the calculation of quantum corrections to conductivity involves the computation of cooperons.@xcite in the case of multi - valley systems with negligible spin - orbit coupling , such as graphene or silicon , the coorepons are derived from an integral equation with the kernel @xmath10 , where the indices @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 enumerate valleys , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the electron wave vectors measured from the valleys centers , and the angle brackets denote averaging over the positions of scatterers .",
    "we note that in a single - valley system  due to the time inversion symmetry , one may take the orbital wave functions of free electrons in the form @xmath17 , which yields @xmath18 .",
    "then , the correlator @xmath19 equals to the correlator @xmath20 determine the single - particle transport .",
    "it leads to a diffusion pole in the cooperon equation and , therefore , to an enhancement of backscattering ( weak localization ) .",
    "in contrast , @xmath21 generally in multi - valley systems , there are no diffusion poles in intra - valley cooperons , and weak localization is absent in the approximation of independent valleys.@xcite however , the special form of scattering amplitude may result in a diffusion pole even in the one - valley model .    to consider this phenomenon for graphene we neglect the small trigonal warping of electron spectrum and take the effective hamiltonian describing electron states in each valley in the form @xmath22 here",
    ", @xmath23 is electron velocity and @xmath24 is the momentum operator .",
    "the wave functions of conduction band may be chosen in the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the polar angle of the in - plane wave vector @xmath15 .",
    "we consider @xmath27-doped graphene and assume that the valence - band states do not contribute to low - temperature conductivity .",
    "the intra - valley electron scattering from a short - range impurity ( @xmath28 symmetry ) is described by the hamiltonian @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the impurity position .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ psi ] ) and  ( [ h_imp ] ) that the matrix element of scattering has the form @xmath31   \\nonumber \\:.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can see that the direct back scattering from an impurity is suppressed and , what is more important for quantum effects , the scattering introduces the phase @xmath32 to the electron wave function .",
    "therefore , an electron traveling clockwise along a closed path and finally scattered back gains the additional phase @xmath33 while the electron traveling in the opposite direction gains the phase @xmath34 . the phase shift of @xmath35 between these two waves results in a destructive interference and , hence , in the antilocalization of carriers .",
    "we note that other forms of scattering amplitude , e.g. , @xmath36 $ ] with @xmath37 , lead to the phase gain which depends on the particular trajectory even for closed paths .",
    "averaging over the trajectories destroys the wave interference and results in no quantum corrections to conductivity ( see also refs .  ) .",
    "similar arguments apply for a surfaces of bulk topological insulators and hgte qws with the dirac - like spectrum of carriers .",
