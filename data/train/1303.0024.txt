    "the rest - frame uv / optical light moves to the infrared range .",
    "therefore , infrared observations , especially the combination of @xmath13 and _ spitzer space telescope _ ( @xmath19 ) , are essential to measure properties of these high - redshift galaxies . @xmath13 near - ir data constrain the slope of the rest - frame uv spectrum and help to decipher the properties of young stellar populations .",

    "a diversity of physical properties are found among these galaxies , although the universe is younger than one billion years .    despite the progress that has been made on properties of high - redshift galaxies ,",
    "there is a lack of a large , reliable sample of @xmath0 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts and high - quality infrared photometry .",
    "the reason is twofold .",
    "for galaxies found by ground - based telescopes  although they are relatively bright and have spectroscopic redshifts  they often do not have measured infrared ( rest - frame uv / optical ) information . for example , only a small amount of laes at @xmath0 have been observed in the near - ir bands by @xmath13 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . on the other hand",
    ", galaxies found by @xmath13 ( e.g. those in the goods fields ) , do have near - ir photometry , but most of them are too faint for follow - up spectroscopic identification by current facilities .",
    "so they do not have secure redshifts , making it difficult for accurate sed modeling .",
    "a model sed derived from a few photometric points without a secure redshift is usually highly degenerate .",
    "therefore , determination of the physical properties of @xmath0 galaxies demands a large sample of galaxies with both spectroscopic redshifts and high - quality infrared photometry .    in this paper",
    "we will present deep @xmath13 and @xmath19 observations of 67 spectroscopically - confirmed ( hereafter spec - confirmed ) galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "this galaxy sample contains 51 laes and 16 lbgs , and is the largest collection of spec - confirmed galaxies in this redshift range .",
    "the spectroscopic redshifts of the sample provide great advantages for measuring the physical properties of galaxies . first",
    ", this sample is uncontaminated by interlopers .",
    "a photometrically - selected ( hereafter photo - selected ) sample of high - redshift galaxies may be contaminated by interlopers such as low - redshift red or dusty galaxies and galactic late - type dwarf stars , which may cause various bias on measurements of physical properties .",
    "second , spectroscopic redshifts remove one critical free parameter for sed modeling . for the brightest galaxies at @xmath0 ,",
    "there are usually only 45 broad - band photometric points available ( e.g. , two @xmath13 bands , two @xmath19 irac bands , and one optical band ) for producing stellar population models .",
    "given the limited degrees of freedom , a spectroscopic redshift will significantly improve sed modeling , especially when nebular emission is considered . at @xmath0 , strong nebular emission lines such as [ oiii ] @xmath225007 , h@xmath20 , and h@xmath1  enter irac 1 and 2 channels , which affect our estimate of stellar populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , the public data do not include the data taken recently ( also by subaru suprime - cam ) , and the data taken in the @xmath38 and nb973 bands .",
    "therefore , we produced our own stacked images by including all available images in the subaru archive , as explained below .",
    "our data processing began with the raw images obtained from the archival server smoka @xcite .",
    "raw images with point spread function ( psf ) sizes greater than @xmath39 were rejected .",

    ", we used the public @xmath40-band image as the astrometric reference catalog in scamp .",
    "both science and weight - map images were scaled and updated using the astrometric and photometric solutions measured from scamp . instead of homogenizing psfs to a certain value",
    "as was done for the public data , we incorporated psf information into the weight image so that the weight was proportional to the inverse of the square of the psf fwhm .",

    "we determined photometric zero points from the public sdf images whose zero points were known .",
    "the sxds optical imaging data were reduced in the same way as we did for the sdf .",
    "our sdf broad - band images are deeper than the public images in the @xmath44 bands , because the sdf team obtained more imaging data from subaru recently , and we included all the available data above .",
    "for example , the public @xmath34-band image has a depth of @xmath45 mag ( @xmath41 detection in a @xmath46 diameter aperture ) with a total integration time of @xmath97 hr . to date , the total @xmath34-band data amount to @xmath929 hr . our new @xmath34-band image has a depth of @xmath927.0 mag , 0.9 mag deeper than the public image .",

    "therefore , we stacked all the images taken with both sets of ccds , as @xcite did in their work .",

    "the aperture correction is determined from more than 100 bright , but unsaturated point sources in the same image .",
    "almost all our galaxies are point - like objects and are not resolved in the sdf images . in cases where galaxies clearly show extended features , we use mag_auto magnitudes as the best estimates of the total magnitudes . in table 1 , we did not list broad - band photometry for the galaxies with weak detections ( @xmath51 ) in the @xmath52 band .",

    "the exposure time was two orbits per band per pointing ( or per object ) , split into four exposures .",

    "after we finished several targets , nicmos failed , and then wfc3 was installed in may 2009 . since wfc3 has much higher sensitivity , the rest of the galaxies in go 11149 and all the galaxies in go 12329 and 12616 were observed with wfc3 . because of the larger fov of wfc3 and the increasing number of known @xmath0 galaxies in the sdf , we changed our observing strategy for go 12329 and 12616 .",
    "we chose the regions that cover at least 3 galaxies ( up to 5 ) per @xmath13/wfc3 pointing . by doing this",
    "we were able to observe many galaxies in a small number of telescope pointings .",
    "we used f125w ( hereafter @xmath60 ) and @xmath59 in these two programs . in go 12329 ,",
    "the exposure time was one orbit per filter per pointing .",
    "we found that some galaxies in our sample were barely detected with this depth .",

    "2011 for the anticipated sensitivity in two - orbit wfc3 exposures ) .",
    "we also re - observed most galaxies that were observed in go 12329 , so that they have a total of two - orbit depth per band . as in the nicmos observations above , the wfc3 observation of each pointing ( per band ) was split into four exposures .",

    "although the scatters are large , the lae slopes are apparently not steeper than the lbg slopes in our sample .",
    "they are also not steeper than the slopes of the lbgs in previous studies mentioned above , which is contrary to the assumption that laes contain younger stellar populations than lbgs do .",
    "this indicates that most laes are probably not as young as what was previously suggested .",
    "the majority of our galaxies have slopes @xmath126 in figure 3(a ) .",
    "there are a fraction of galaxies whose slopes are steeper than 2.7 .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the @xmath129 galaxies , if confirmed by future deeper observations , will be challenging for current simulations @xcite .",

    "so it is difficult to accurately correct for light loss .",
    "in addition , even with a few hour integration on the largest telescopes , the spectral quality of many galaxies are still poor , simply because they are faint .",
    "all of the above effects can easily result in large uncertainties in the measurements of their ly@xmath1  luminosities .",

    "the @xmath34 band is very broad , and its photometry is almost completely dominated by the uv continuum flux .",
    "therefore , even small uncertainties on the @xmath34-band photometry or on measurements of uv continuum will cause very large uncertainties on the ly@xmath1emission .",

    "we estimate sfrs from the uv continuum luminosity and ly@xmath1  luminosity , respectively .",
    "the uv sfr is derived by : @xmath138 where l@xmath139(uv ) is the uv continuum luminosity @xcite .",
    "we use the average of the luminosities at rest - frame 1500 and 3000   to compute l@xmath139(uv ) . for the ly@xmath1",
    "sfr , we use the expression : @xmath140 which is based on the line emission ratio of ly@xmath1  to h@xmath1  in case b recombination @xcite and the relation between sfr and the h@xmath1   luminosity @xcite .",
    "the derived sfrs are listed in columns 6 and 7 of table 2 .",
    "figure 7 compares the two estimated sfrs without correction for dust extinction . as in figure 6 , the filled circles are the galaxies with reliable measurements .",
    "these galaxies have moderate sfrs from a few to a few tens @xmath141 yr@xmath27 . the open circles are the galaxies with weak near - ir detections , and their measurements of sfrs are crude . because they have large ly@xmath1  ews and weak uv continuum flux ( figure 6 ) , they show small uv sfrs ( @xmath119 @xmath141 yr@xmath27 ) and high sfr(ly@xmath1)-to - sfr(uv ) ratios . for the purpose of comparison",
    ", we correct sfr(ly@xmath1 ) for the igm absorption .",
    "ly@xmath1  emission at high redshift is complicated by factors such as the resonant scattering of ly@xmath1  photons and the igm absorption , and it is difficult to model ly@xmath1  radiative transfer and predict intrinsic ly@xmath1  emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we thus do not correct individual galaxies .",
    "instead , we derive an average ly@xmath1  flux reduction for all the galaxies . the average correction is calculated from the composite ly@xmath1  line of @xcite by assuming that the intrinsic ly@xmath1  profile is symmetric around the peak of the composite line .",
    "the dotted line in figure 7 illustrates the average correction of 24% . when the effect of the igm absorption is taken into account in this way , the uv and ly@xmath1  sfrs for most luminous galaxies ( filled circles ) are reasonably consistent within a factor of two .",
    "figure 7 shows a trend that the sfr(ly@xmath1)-to - sfr(uv ) ratio becomes increasingly smaller towards higher sfrs .",
    "the dashed line illustrates this trend by displaying the best log - linear fit to the data points .",
    "this trend is already suggested by the relation between ew(ly@xmath1 ) and @xmath99 in figure 6 , since sfr(uv ) reflects @xmath99 and ew(ly@xmath1 ) mimics sfr(ly@xmath1)/sfr(uv ) .",
    "accordingly , this trend has also been shaped by the selection effect due to the nature of the flux - limited sample , i.e. , we have missed low sfr(uv ) galaxies with low sfr(ly@xmath1)-to - sfr(uv ) ratios .",
    "therefore , the real trend of the sfr(ly@xmath1)-to - sfr(uv ) ratio , if exists , should be much weaker than it appears .",
    "this trend could also be due partly to the relation between sfrs and the escape fractions of ly@xmath1  photons .",
    "the model of @xcite predicts that at high redshift , the escape fractions of ly@xmath1  photons in low - sfr galaxies are close to 1 , but become smaller in galaxies with higher sfrs ( see also e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is also consistent with @xcite , who found that in a sample of luminous ( high sfrs ) @xmath0 lbgs , the ly@xmath1   sfrs are only @xmath142% of the uv sfrs .",
    "figure  6 shows an apparent correlation between ew(ly@xmath1 ) and @xmath99 in our sample .",
    "as we already mentioned , the relation is affected by the nature of the flux - limited sample , i.e. , the limiting ly@xmath1 line flux ( and therefore the limiting line luminosity ) associated with both narrow - band and spectroscopic observations . in figure  8(a ) , we plot the current lae samples at @xmath2 and 6.5 , as well as those from another large lae survey at @xmath143 , 3.7 , and 5.7 by @xcite .",
    "the diagonal dotted line is defined by a ly@xmath1  luminosity of @xmath144 erg s@xmath27 , which roughly corresponds to the limits of these surveys .",
    "the figure illustrates that the slope of the ew(ly@xmath1)@xmath114 relation is largely shaped by the limiting luminosity , which censors sources that would fall below the diagonal dotted line .",
    "in addition , as pointed out by @xcite , ew is a derived quantity from the emission line and underlying continuum , so any relation between ew and the line ( or continuum ) flux may suffer from correlated errors .",
    "such correlated errors could result in an apparent relation by scattering objects towards one direction @xcite .",
    "although nothing definite can be said about the properties of high - redshift laes below our detection limit , it is natural to expect that the distribution of laes extends toward smaller ew(ly@xmath1 ) .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to see how the population of low - redshift low - luminosity laes compares with the high - redshift population shown in figure  8(a ) . in figure  8(b ) , we include the sample of galex - selected @xmath145 laes presented by @xcite .",
    "the figure shows that this low - redshift lae sample contains the kind of laes that would be missed at high redshift ( i.e. , below the dotted line ) .",
    "once these low - luminosity laes are included , the ew(ly@xmath1)@xmath114 correlation could diminish .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that no evolution has been established with the ew distribution of laes from @xmath145 to @xmath146 @xcite and from @xmath143 to 5.7 @xcite .",
    "this may suggest the possibility that although bright laes are more abundant at high redshift , the underlying ly@xmath1  ew distribution may be fairly invariant .",
    "however , we also caution that the lack of a correlation in figure  8(b ) is partly caused by another selection effect in these lae samples , namely ew(ly@xmath1 ) @xmath147 20  , which produces a sharp horizontal boundary at the bottom .",
    "in addition , the mix of different samples in figure 8 could dilute intrinsic relations ( if exist ) .",
    "given these selection effects , it is difficult to determine with the current lae samples how strong the correlation between ew(ly@xmath1 ) and @xmath114 is . to perform such an analysis in a statistically meaningful manner , we will need a much larger lae sample , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "for the discussion in the subsequent sections , we will assume two extreme cases : ( 1 ) the slope of the ew(ly@xmath1)@xmath114 correlation is as steep as seen in figure  6 ( the dashed line in the lower panel ) ; ( 2 ) the slope of the ew(ly@xmath1)@xmath114 correlation is completely flat . as we shall see , these two limiting cases will minimize / maximize the size of the lae population and therefore their contribution to the rest - frame uv luminosity density .",
    "in this paper we call galaxies found by the narrow - band technique laes and those found by the dropout technique lbgs .",
    "this is a widely used definition . strictly speaking ,",
    "this lae / lbg classification only reflects the methodology that we employ to select galaxies .",
    "it does not necessarily mean that the two types of galaxies are intrinsically different .",
    "a galaxy with strong ly@xmath1   emission could be detected by the both techniques .",
    "another popular definition of laes is based on the rest - frame ew of the ly@xmath1   emission line .",
    "one galaxy is a lae if its ly@xmath1  ew is greater than , for example , 20  . with this definition ,",
    "almost all the galaxies in our sample are laes , as seen from figure 6 .",
    "this definition with ly@xmath1  ew is physically more meaningful .",
    "however , the measurements of ly@xmath1  ews are usually accompanied with large errors .",
    "furthermore , one can easily obtain a flux - limited sample , but not a ew - limited sample .",
    "it is not yet totally clear whether high - redshift laes and lbgs represent physically different populations .",
    "direct comparison between laes and lbgs is difficult .",
    "the procedure of obtaining a spectroscopic sample of laes is relatively straightforward .",
    "lae candidates are selected based on their ly@xmath1  luminosities ( and one or more broad - band photometry ) , and follow - up spectroscopic identification is also based on their ly@xmath1  luminosities .",
    "this results in a complete flux - limited sample in terms of ly@xmath1  luminosity .",
    "for lbgs at @xmath0 , candidate selection is based on broad - band colors , but spectroscopic identification is based on ly@xmath1  luminosity . therefore , the resultant lbg sample is inhomogeneous in depth of either ly@xmath1  luminosity or uv continuum luminosity , and represents only a subset of lbgs with strong ly@xmath1  emission .",
    "so far , we did not find significant differences between our laes and lbgs in the uv luminosity range of @xmath101 mag .",
    "figures 3 and 4 have shown that they have similar uv continuum slopes .",
    "the laes do not exhibit steeper slopes than the lbgs , indicating that their underlying stellar populations are not very different . to examine the relation between laes and lbgs further , one useful tool is the ew(ly@xmath1)@xmath114 plot in the form of figures 6 and 8 .",
    "we expect the two populations to have a large overlap , but the focus here is on the non - overlapping population(s ) that can be picked up by one selection method but not by the other .",
    "for example , the lae selection may pick up galaxies with extremely large ew(ly@xmath1 ) whose continuum emission is so faint that they will drop out of lbg samples .",
    "alternatively , the lbg selection can pick up galaxies with small ew(ly@xmath1 ) which do not show up in lae samples .",
    "therefore , we would like to know how significant / insignificant such non - overlapping populations between laes and lbgs are .",
    "figure  9 plots ew(ly@xmath1 ) and @xmath114 of high - redshift laes ( from figure  8) and lbgs together .",
    "the latter sample comes from this work ( @xmath12 ) and from @xcite ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "the figure suggests that there is no significant difference between the lae and lbg populations in terms of the ew(ly@xmath1 ) and @xmath114 distributions .",
    "the two populations occupy roughly the same region on the plot .",
    "for example , we do not see any sign of enhanced ly@xmath1  strengths among the lae population .",
    "this implies that the lbg selection would almost fully recover the lae population . in other words , there are very few laes with exceptionally large ly@xmath1  ews that would drop out of the lbg selection due to their faintness in continuum .",
    "the reverse ( i.e. , lbgs that would escape the lae selection due to weak ly@xmath1  emission ) is difficult to assess with our current sample because our spectroscopic program was not designed as an extensive follow - up of lbgs . in the next section",
    ", we will construct the uv continuum lf of laes and examine how it compares with the uv continuum lf of lbgs .",
    "because of the deep @xmath13 images , we were able to detect almost all the laes at a significance of @xmath135 .",
    "this allows us to derive the uv continuum lf of laes directly from the data .",
    "the uv lf of laes together with the uv lf of lbgs will help us estimate the fraction of galaxies that have strong ly@xmath1emission , and constrain the contribution of laes to the total uv ionizing photons .",
    "our laes are from a ly@xmath1  flux - limited ( not ew - limited ) sample , so they have different detection limits of ly@xmath1  ews at different uv luminosities ( see figures  8 and 9 ) . in this subsection",
    ", we will derive the uv lf of laes with ly@xmath1  ews greater than 20  , by extrapolating the observed lae population down to this ew threshold .",
    "we first compute the number densities of the laes without extrapolating the lae population to the ew threshold of 20  . the area covered by our laes",
    "is calculated from the area of the whole lae sample given in @xcite , by matching the number of our laes to the number of the whole lae sample .",
    "we do not use the actual area that our @xmath13 observations covered , because we selected high surface - density regions of galaxies for the @xmath13 programs ( see section 2.3 ) .",
    "we then incorporate the completeness corrections from @xcite .",
    "completeness is calculated for individual galaxies , as it is a function of narrow - band magnitude .",
    "the resultant number densities are shown as the thick blue and red lines in figure 10 .",
    "they set the absolute lower limits on the uv lf of laes at @xmath149 and 6.5 .",
    "we then extrapolate the densities to @xmath150   using the ly@xmath1  ew distribution function .",
    "figure 11 shows the ly@xmath1  ew distribution of the laes in our sample .",
    "we assume that the ew distribution is an exponential function @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is ew and @xmath153 is the @xmath154-folding width .",
    "it is often assumed that @xmath153 is correlated with uv luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we assume that @xmath153 is a log - linear function of @xmath99 : @xmath155 , where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are scaling factors .",
    "given the small numbers of the galaxies , it is not realistic to obtain reliable measurements for both @xmath156 and @xmath157 . therefore , we consider the two extreme cases mentioned in section 5.1 : ( 1 ) @xmath158 , where we assume that the slope of the ew(ly@xmath1)@xmath99 correlation is as steep as seen in figure  6 ( the dashed line in the lower panel ) ; ( 2 ) @xmath159 , where the slope of the correlation is completely flat .",
    "these two limiting cases will minimize ( @xmath158)/maximize ( @xmath159 ) the size of the lae population .",
    "the real @xmath157 value is between 0 and 0.225 .",
    "we then determine @xmath156 by fitting the exponential function to the ew distribution of the laes with @xmath101 mag in our sample .",
    "the best fit is shown in the top panel of figure 11 . with the derived @xmath156 and assumed @xmath157 we can calculate the ly@xmath1  ew distribution at any luminosity .",
    "the other panels in figure 11 show the predicted ew distributions for the two extreme cases with the dashed ( @xmath158 ) and dash - dotted ( @xmath159 ) lines .",
    "the shaded regions in figure  10 show the uv lfs of laes corrected to @xmath160   for the two extreme cases .",
    "their lower and upper boundaries represent the lower and upper limits of the lfs .",
    "the @xmath161 statistical uncertainties have been included . at @xmath162 mag ,",
    "no correction is actually applied , because our sample is complete at @xmath163   down to this magnitude . towards fainter magnitudes ,",
    "the correction becomes increasingly larger , and the difference of correction between the two cases also becomes larger . in the faintest end ,",
    "the difference of the number densities between the lower and upper limits is larger than a factor of 3 .",
    "the cyan and green curves in figure  10 show the uv lfs of photo - selected lbgs from the literature @xcite , compared to our results . at the bright end ,",
    "the lae uv lfs are roughly comparable to the lbg lfs go program 11149 slightly favored galaxies with bright continuum flux .",
    "this could increase the number densities by up to 50% in the bright end , but is not large enough to change the basic conclusion . ] , consistent with similar results reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this suggests a large fraction of laes among the brightest lbgs .",
    "such high fraction has been observed by @xcite , who found that the lae fraction in a sample of very bright ( @xmath164 mag ) uds lbgs is about 50% .",
    "@xcite reported a lower fraction ( @xmath165% ) of laes with ew(ly@xmath1 ) @xmath166   in a sample of bright @xmath116 lbgs ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "we note , however , their sample contains a small fraction ( 10% ) of laes with @xmath168 mag , so their lae fraction is dominated by the galaxies at @xmath169 mag .",
    "our lae fraction ( @xmath170% ) in a similar range of @xmath171 is not much different from theirs , given their slightly higher ew limit .",
    "note that the measurements of the lae fraction among the brightest galaxies are subject to large uncertainties owing to the small numbers of galaxies available .    in figure 10 , the uv lf of laes at the faint end is even more uncertain , as it depends critically on how we extend the ew(ly@xmath1 ) distribution toward ew = 20  , which is far below our detection limits .",
    "current ground - based spectroscopy is not yet able to reach this regime .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath157 we assume , the faint - end slope of the lae uv lf could be almost as steep as that of the lbg uv lf ( @xmath172 ) or significantly flatter ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "if we maximize the lae uv lf by assuming @xmath172 , we have to apply a large incompleteness correction ( @xmath174 at the faintest end ) to account for laes down to ew(ly@xmath1 ) = 20  .",
    "it means that the ly@xmath1  ew distribution must be highly concentrated on small ews , so that the observed laes represent a small sub - group of high - ew galaxies that constitutes a tiny fraction of the overall lae population . despite this uncertainty ,",
    "it is reasonable to conclude with figure  10 that the number density of laes falls significantly short of that of lbgs at the faint end .",
    "this result could have an important implication for the population of galaxies that were responsible for cosmic reionization .",
    "it implies the existence of a large population of lbgs with weak ly@xmath1   emission ( @xmath10  ) .",
    "because the uv lf slope of lbgs is steep , the vast majority of the uv photons would come from very faint galaxies ( far below @xmath175 ) .",
    "this suggests that the lbg population with weak ly@xmath1  emission dominate the uv photon budget for cosmic reionization .    in figure 10 ,",
    "the comparison between the uv lfs of laes at @xmath2 and 6.5 is straightforward , and it shows little evolution .",
    "this supports the previous claim that the ly@xmath1  lf evolution from @xmath176 to 6.5 is due to an increasing neutral fraction of the igm between the two redshifts and not due to the evolution of the lae galaxy population @xcite .",
    "these studies showed that the ly@xmath1  lf evolves rapidly from @xmath176 to 6.5 , and pointed out in particular that there is a lack of luminous laes at @xmath177 .",
    "in contrast , the evolution of the uv lf of laes between the two redshifts is much more modest .",
    "this was explained by the increasing neutral fraction of igm from @xmath176 to 6.5 that attenuates ly@xmath1  emission . in these studies ,",
    "the uv continuum luminosities were measured from the sdf @xmath34-band imaging data , which can only detect bright laes , and are also contaminated by ly@xmath1  emission ( and lyman break ) for @xmath15 laes .",
    "our @xmath13 data were deep enough to detect almost all the laes in our sample , so our measurements of uv continuum luminosities are more robust .",
    "we confirm the consistency of the uv lfs of laes at @xmath2 and 6.5 , which rules out the possibility of a strong intrinsic galaxy evolution between the two redshifts , and strengthens the interpretation that the increasing neutral fraction of igm causes the strong evolution of the ly@xmath1  lf towards @xmath15 .",
    "we have carried out deep @xmath13 near - ir and @xmath19 mid - ir observations of a large sample of spec - confirmed galaxies at @xmath30 .",
    "the sample contains 51 laes and 16 lbgs , representing the most luminous galaxies in this redshift range .",
    "the laes were from a complete flux - limited sample .",
    "the lbgs have quite different depth , and only contain those with strong ly@xmath1  emission .",
    "the majority of the galaxies ( 62 out of 67 ) were discovered in the sdf , and the remaining were found in the sxds .",
    "the @xmath13 observations of the sdf galaxies were made with wfc3 and nicmos in the @xmath52 ( f110w or f125w ) and @xmath65 ( f160w ) bands .",
    "the depth is two @xmath13 orbits per band for most of the objects . with such depth nearly 80% of the galaxies",
    "were detected at high significance ( @xmath80 ) in the @xmath52 band .",
    "the @xmath19 observations of the sdf were made in two irac channels 1 and 2 .",
    "the depth varies across the field from @xmath93 hrs to @xmath96 hrs .",
    "the infrared data of the five sxds galaxies were taken from the @xmath13 and @xmath19 archive .",
    "in addition to the infrared data , we also have extremely deep optical images in a series of broad bands ( @xmath42 ) and narrow bands ( nb816 , nb921 , and nb973 ) .",
    "we have used the combination of the optical and infrared data to derive the properties of rest - frame uv continuum and ly@xmath1  emission , such as uv continuum luminosities and slopes , ly@xmath1  luminosities and ews , and sfrs etc .",
    "while the whole sample covers a large uv continuum luminosity range from @xmath178 mag to @xmath179 mag , the galaxies with significant detections ( @xmath80 ) in the @xmath52 band cover a bright range of @xmath180 mag .",
    "these galaxies have steep uv continuum slopes roughly between @xmath6 and @xmath103 , with a weighted mean of @xmath7 .",
    "this value is slightly steeper than the slopes of photo - selected lbgs reported in previous studies in the literature .",
    "this is due to the fact that our galaxies have strong ly@xmath1  emission , and thus lower dust extinction and steeper uv slopes .",
    "the slope @xmath20 shows little trend with the uv luminosity when the several brightest galaxies are excluded .",
    "the laes do not display significantly bluer slopes than the lbgs in this sample and those in previous studies , suggesting that most laes are probably not younger than lbgs as expected previously .",
    "a small fraction of our galaxies have extremely steep uv slopes with @xmath8 . stellar populations in these galaxies",
    "could be very young with extremely low metallicity and dust content .",
    "our galaxies have moderately strong ly@xmath1  ews in a wide range of @xmath910 to @xmath9200  .",
    "the sfrs estimated from the ly@xmath1  and uv luminosities are also moderate , from a few to a few tens @xmath141 yr@xmath27 .    we have also derived the uv lfs of laes with @xmath181   at @xmath2 and 6.5 , using our deep @xmath13 near - ir data .",
    "we have confirmed that the number density of laes ( @xmath181  ) is comparable to that of lbgs at the bright end .",
    "this suggests that the lae fraction among bright lbgs is very high .",
    "we also concluded that the number density of laes can not be as high as that of lbgs at the faint end , even if we maximize the former by adjusting a model parameter @xmath157 ( i.e. , @xmath159 ) .",
    "this implies that there exists a substantial population of faint lbgs with weak ly@xmath1  emission ( @xmath10  ) that could be the dominant contribution to the total uv luminosity density at @xmath0 .",

    "in fact , in the ew(ly@xmath1)@xmath114 diagram , the distributions of the two populations are quite similar , showing no sign of enhanced ly@xmath1 strengths among the lae population . all these seem to indicate that laes can be considered as a subset of lbgs with strong ly@xmath1  emission lines .",
