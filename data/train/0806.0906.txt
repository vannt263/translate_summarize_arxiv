    "the boolean complex of a finitely generated coxeter system @xmath2 arises from the bruhat order on @xmath3 .",
    "regarding @xmath3 as a poset in the bruhat order , we define the _ boolean ideal _",
    "@xmath4 to be the subposet consisting of those elements whose principal ( lower ) order ideals are boolean .",
    "the boolean ideal is a simplicial poset , and , as the name suggests , it is an order ideal of @xmath3 . in fact , it is maximal among order ideals that are simplicial posets .",
    "boolean complex _ is defined as the regular cell complex @xmath5 whose face poset is the ( simplicial ) poset @xmath6 .",
    "the elements in @xmath6 are easily described : an element in @xmath6 is an element of @xmath3 that can be written as a product of distinct elements from the generating set @xmath7 .",
    "consequently the boolean complex is pure , with each maximal cell having dimension @xmath8 .",
    "these elements play an important role in the study of coxeter groups because their boolean nature has a variety of consequences related to @xmath9-polynomials , kazhdan - lusztig polynomials , and @xmath10-polynomials ( see @xcite ) .    as described above , elements of the boolean ideal are products of distinct elements of the generating set @xmath7 , and",
    "thus are governed by the commutativity of elements of @xmath7 .",
    "consequently , this ideal is determined by the coxeter graph of @xmath2 .",
    "recall that the coxeter graph @xmath11 has vertex set @xmath7 , with an edge between vertices @xmath12 and @xmath13 if and only if @xmath12 and @xmath13 do not commute in @xmath3 .",
    "an edge is labeled by the order @xmath14 of @xmath15 when @xmath16 .",
    "since we are only concerned with the commutativity of generators in this paper , we suppress the labels and consider the underlying unlabeled graph . because elements of @xmath7 are involutions , the elements @xmath12 and @xmath13 commute if and only if @xmath17 , and hence if and only if the vertices @xmath12 and @xmath13 are non - adjacent in @xmath18 . for more information about coxeter systems ,",
    "see @xcite .    from the graph @xmath18 , one constructs a simplicial poset @xmath19",
    "whose elements are equivalence classes of strings of distinct elements of @xmath7 , where two strings are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by commuting elements that are non - adjacent in @xmath18 .",
    "the partial order on @xmath19 is induced by substring inclusion . of course , when @xmath11 , the poset @xmath19 is isomorphic to the poset @xmath6 , so this construction recovers the boolean ideal from the ( unlabeled ) coxeter graph .",
    "we refer to @xmath19 as the _ boolean ideal of @xmath18 _ , and to the associated regular cell complex @xmath20 as the _",
    "boolean complex of @xmath18_.    if @xmath18 is the complete graph , then @xmath19 is the complex of injective words , which has previously been studied by farmer @xcite , bjrner and wachs @xcite , and reiner and webb @xcite .",
    "the complete graph is treated in corollary  [ cor : complete ] .",
    "[ ex : a2 ] if the graph @xmath18 consists of two vertices and a single edge between them , then the poset @xmath19 and the boolean complex @xmath20 are depicted in figure  [ fig : ex1 ] .    because their unlabeled coxeter graphs are",
    "the same , example  [ ex : a2 ] applies to the coxeter groups @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and shows that in each case the geometric realization of the boolean complex is homotopy equivalent to the unit circle @xmath23 . in this paper , we prove more generally that the boolean complex of any finite simple graph , and hence of any coxeter system , has geometric realization homotopy equivalent to a wedge of top dimensional spheres , and give a recursive formula for calculating the number of these spheres . in specific cases , including the finite and affine irreducible coxeter systems , we calculate this number explicitly .",
    "the subsequent organization of this paper begins with a section precisely defining the primary objects and putting this project in the greater context of the study of the bruhat order of coxeter group .",
    "section  [ section : main results ] states the main result of the article , that the boolean complex for any finite simple graph has geometric realization homotopy equivalent to a wedge of a particular number of top dimensional spheres .",
    "the homotopy types for the boolean complexes of the finite and affine irreducible coxeter systems are given as a corollary in this section .",
    "section  [ section : morse ] discusses discrete morse theory , which is the main tool in the proof presented in section  [ section : proof ] .",
    "a selection of corollaries to the main theorem are given in section  [ section : corollaries ] .",
    "section [ sec : homology ] contains a discussion on how generating cycles for the homology of boolean complex enumerate the spheres occurring in the wedge sum representing the homotopy type of its geometric realization .",
    "the paper concludes with suggestions for follow - up questions in section  [ section : follow - up ] .",
    "as noted above , the motivation for this work is the study of coxeter systems and coxeter graphs , and the importance of their boolean elements .",
    "henceforth , all coxeter systems are assumed to be finitely generated .",
    "we use standard poset terminology throughout this paper , and refer the reader to @xcite for more background .",
    "let @xmath3 be a group defined on generators @xmath7 .",
    "the pair @xmath2 is a _",
    "coxeter system _ if the relations in @xmath3 are of the form @xmath24 for all @xmath25 , and @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    because @xmath7 consists of involutions , two elements @xmath27 commute if and only if @xmath17 . the involution condition also implies that @xmath29 .",
    "since @xmath7 generates @xmath3 , any @xmath30 can be written as a word on letters in @xmath7 .",
    "that is , @xmath31 admits an expression @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "the product @xmath34 is a _ reduced expression _ for @xmath31 if it is of minimal length @xmath35 , in which case @xmath35 is the _ length _ of @xmath31 .    for a coxeter system @xmath2 , the _ ( strong )",
    "bruhat order _ is the partial order on @xmath3 where @xmath36 if and only if @xmath31 admits a reduced expression that is a subword of a reduced expression of @xmath37 .",
    "[ rem : rank -1 ] the bruhat order makes @xmath3 a ranked poset , with rank determined by length . because the minimal element in a simplicial poset corresponds to the empty face in the geometric realization of that poset , we make the the convention that this minimal element has rank @xmath38 , thus emphasizing that the face data in the poset is contained in the non - negative ranks .",
    "the structure of the bruhat order for finite coxeter groups was studied by the second author in @xcite .",
    "one aspect of this study was a description of elements with boolean principal order ideals .",
    "let @xmath2 be a coxeter system and regard @xmath3 as a poset under the bruhat order .",
    "an element @xmath30 is _ boolean _ if its principal ( lower ) order ideal in @xmath3 is isomorphic to a boolean algebra .",

    "@xmath4 is the subposet of boolean elements .",
    "it is clear from the definition that @xmath6 is an order ideal in the bruhat order , thus justifying the terminology .",
    "it is also clear , by construction , that @xmath6 is a simplicial poset .    because the boolean poset is simplicial , the interval between any two comparable elements is boolean and , in particular , a lattice .",
    "by @xcite , this has several implications for the kazhdan - lusztig polynomials , @xmath9-polynomials , and @xmath10-polynomials .",
    "for example , for any @xmath39 with @xmath40 , we have @xmath41^*;q )   = 1,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the kazhdan - lusztig polynomial , and @xmath43}(q ) = ( q-1)^{\\ell(\\tau ) - \\ell(\\sigma)},\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the length function .",
    "further structural and computational consequences can be found in @xcite .    the results in @xcite state that for the finite coxeter groups of types @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , boolean elements can be characterized by pattern avoidance .",
    "moreover , the boolean elements of these groups are enumerated by length .",
    "for example , the number of boolean elements of length @xmath47 in the finite coxeter group @xmath48 is @xmath49 as the unlabeled coxeter graphs for @xmath48 and @xmath50 are identical , the boolean elements of length @xmath47 in @xmath50 are also enumerated by . for the group @xmath51 ,",
    "the enumeration is more complicated , and a recursive formula is given in @xcite .",
    "the following lemma is immediate from the description of the bruhat order above , and gives a useful characterization of boolean elements .",
    "[ lem : booleanelements ] let @xmath2 be a coxeter system .",
    "an element of @xmath3 is boolean if and only if it has no repeated letters in its reduced expressions .",
    "it follows from the lemma that every maximal element in @xmath6 has the same rank , equal to @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath2 be a coxeter system .",
    "the _ boolean complex _ of @xmath2 is the regular cell complex @xmath5 whose face poset is the simplicial poset @xmath6 .",
    "the existence of such a complex @xmath5 follows from a well - known result about simplicial posets , and in fact about cw - posets ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the minimal element of @xmath6 represents the empty cell , and an element of rank @xmath52 represents a @xmath47-dimensional cell ( see remark  [ rem : rank -1 ] ) .",
    "one can think of the cells in @xmath6 as simplices , because the minimal subcomplex containing each cell is isomorphic to a simplex of the same dimension .",
    "nevertheless , the boolean complex itself is not a simplicial complex because the cells are not determined by the vertices they contain ; for instance , there are two 1-cells , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , with the same vertices in example [ ex : a2 ] .",
    "one obtains a geometric realization @xmath55 of the boolean complex in the standard way , by taking one geometric simplex of dimension @xmath47 for each cell of dimension @xmath47 , and gluing them together according to the face poset .",
    "the _ homotopy type _ of a complex is understood to mean the homotopy type of its geometric realization .",
    "the main result of this paper , theorem  [ thm : main result ] , shows that @xmath55 has the homotopy type of a wedge of spheres of dimension @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , we give a recursive formula for computing the number of spheres in the wedge . to describe this recursion",
    ", we present an alternative construction of the boolean complex , in terms of the unlabeled coxeter graph of @xmath2 .    the _ coxeter graph _",
    "@xmath56 of a coxeter system @xmath2 has vertex set @xmath7 and an edge between @xmath12 and @xmath13 if and only if @xmath57 .",
    "an edge corresponding to @xmath16 is labeled by @xmath14 .",
    "the _ unlabeled coxeter graph _ is the underlying simple graph obtained by omitting all edge labels .",
    "a coxeter system @xmath2 can be recovered from its coxeter graph @xmath18 . taking the vertex set of @xmath18 to be @xmath7 , one forms the group @xmath3 generated by @xmath7 subject to the relations mandated by the edges in @xmath18 , and the condition that @xmath7 should consist of involutions .",
    "an unlabeled coxeter graph , however , contains less information , and only allows one to determine when two elements in @xmath7 commute .",
    "thus , if one is only concerned with commutativity of generators , this graph suffices .",
    "let @xmath3 be the group generated by @xmath58 , with relations @xmath24 for all @xmath25 , and @xmath59 , @xmath60 . the ( unlabeled ) coxeter graph @xmath56 is shown below .",

    "first , let @xmath62 be the set of words on @xmath7 with no repeated letters , ordered by the subword order relation .",
    "a typical element in @xmath62 is thus of the form @xmath63 , where @xmath64 are distinct elements of @xmath7 .",

    "a preimage of an element @xmath67 is called a _",

    "we say that @xmath31 _ contains _ a letter @xmath12 if @xmath12 occurs in the string representatives of @xmath31 . a partial ordering",
    "is induced on the set @xmath19 from the subword order .",
    "that is , @xmath68 in @xmath19 if some word representative of @xmath31 is a subword of a word representative of @xmath37 .",
    "the _ boolean ideal _ of a finite simple graph @xmath18 is the poset @xmath19 .",
    "the motivation for the construction of @xmath19 is of course the following obvious fact , which we record as a lemma .    if @xmath18 is the unlabeled coxeter graph of a coxeter system @xmath2 , then @xmath69 .",
    "it can be shown directly , or via the relationship between graphs and coxeter systems , that @xmath19 is a simplicial poset for all finite simple graphs @xmath18 .",
    "the _ boolean complex _ of a finite simple graph @xmath18 is the regular cell complex @xmath20 associated to @xmath19 .",
    "the main result of this paper , as mentioned above , can be equivalently stated as saying that for any finite simple graph @xmath18 with vertex set @xmath7 , the geometric realization @xmath70 is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of @xmath71-dimensional spheres .",
    "it is this version of the result that we shall prove .",
    "the promised recursive formula for the number of spheres is given in terms of basic graph operations .",
    "these results are stated precisely in theorem [ thm : main result ] .",
    "the euler characteristic @xmath72 of a regular cell complex @xmath73 , and likewise the euler characteristic of its geometric realization @xmath74 , is the alternating sum of the number of faces @xmath75 of each rank @xmath76 in @xmath73 : @xmath77 given remark  [ rem : rank -1 ] , this can also be computed by enumerating each non - negative rank in the corresponding simplicial poset .",
    "in particular , the enumeration from @xcite cited in enables the calculation of the euler characteristic of the boolean complex for the coxeter group @xmath48 .",
    "[ cor : euler characteristic ] for all @xmath78 , @xmath79 where @xmath80 are the fibonacci numbers .",

    "also , corollary  [ cor : euler characteristic ] foreshadows the fact that @xmath84 is homotopy equivalent to the wedge of @xmath85 @xmath1-spheres .    before stating the main results precisely , it is informative to mention similar work which has been done for the _ independence complex_. ehrenborg and hetyei @xcite and kozlov @xcite prove , each in the context of different results and frameworks , that the complex of sparse sets of @xmath86 $ ] is contractible in some cases and homotopy equivalent to a sphere in the remaining cases . in the context of the bruhat order , the sparse subsets of @xmath86 $ ]",
    "correspond to the fully commutative elements in the coxeter group @xmath48 .",

    "it is convenient to use the notation @xmath88 for a wedge sum of @xmath89 spheres of dimension @xmath90 .",

    "if so , is there a bijection between the homology generators for the boolean complexes of such a family and other interesting objects ?    this last question",
    "is taken up in @xcite , where it is shown where the boolean numbers of complete bipartite graphs are expressed in terms of the stirling numbers of the second kind , and that the boolean numbers of ferrers graphs of corresponding to staircase shapes are the genocchi numbers of the second kind .",
