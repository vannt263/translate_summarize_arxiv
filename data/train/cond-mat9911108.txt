    "balatsky and bourges@xcite find a broad commensurate peak , but the width of the peak scales with doping in exactly the same way as the incommensurability in lsco , suggestive of an unresolved underlying incommensurability in ybco , as well .",
    "also , de lozanne@xcite finds direct stm evidence for incommensurate modulations ( parallel to the chains ) with a similar periodicity to the neutron data .",
    "mook@xcite has reported similar incommensurate neutron peaks in bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( bscco ) .",
    "potentially stripe - related phonon anomalies have been reported in both lsco@xcite and ybco@xcite .",
    "doping with zn seems to stabilize the stripe phase@xcite .",
    "photoemission evidence@xcite for stripes has been controversial@xcite .    over the same doping regime , there is also evidence for a pseudogap , and it is an important problem to understand how both pseudogap and stripes can coexist . in particular , photoemission finds a dispersion consistent with the two - dimensional ( 2d ) energy bands , whereas in the stripe phase the magnetic stripes should be insulating , leading to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) dispersion along the charged stripes .",
    "the presence of stripe phases raises important issues of how energy dispersion and even fermi surfaces can be well defined concepts in the presence of fluctuating stripes .",
    "an important insight into this problem is the finding by salkola , et al .",
    "( sek)@xcite that a well - defined average dispersion persists even in the presence of strongly fluctuating stripe order .",
    "however , in that paper , and a related calculation@xcite , the stripes were modelled by a charge density wave like order , with sinusoidally varying hole density .",
    "several unrestricted hartree - fock@xcite or slave boson@xcite calculations find evidence for much sharper density variations .",
    "the present paper analyzes a phase separation scenario , modelling the stripes as associated with free energy minima at two characteristic hole densities .",
    "this allows the doping dependence of the stripes and the resulting photoemission spectrum to be analyzed .",
    "it is found that long - range stripe order can persist even in the presence of coulomb interactions .",
    "the resulting dispersion is clearly recognizable as a superposition of the magnetic and charged stripe dispersions , with superimposed minigaps due to the stripe order .",
    "these dual dispersions provide a natural interpretation for the experimentally observed photoemission dispersions , tying together results on lsco , bscco , and sr@xmath3cuo@xmath3cl@xmath3 ( scoc ) . in the model",
    ", the 1/8 anomaly can be understood as a form of quantum critical point ( qcp ) , associated with a crossover between a magnetic stripe dominated regime and a charged stripe dominated regime . within the latter regime",
    ", the @xmath9 spin gap in ybco is related to the behavior of a two - leg ladder ( isolated magnetic stripe ) .",
    "remarkably , within the charge stripe dispersion , a clear signature of the two - dimensional van hove singularity ( vhs ) persists , down to the limit of a single , two - cu wide stripe . there is a strong coupling of the minigaps with this vhs , leading to a novel _ stripe - induced vhs splitting_. the doping dependence of this splitting closely resembles that of the pseudogap .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii shows that a low hole doping of the charged stripes , @xmath10 is not only compatible with experiment , but also makes sense theoretically , in terms of kinetic - energy stabilized stripes .",
    "the models for the magnetic and the charged stripes are introduced in section iii , along with a discussion of long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "section iv gives the results of the stripe calculations , which self - consistently determine the hole distribution .",
    "the doping dependence of the dispersion is presented , for varying strengths of coulomb repulsion . finally , the effect of an additional ( ferromagnetic ) interaction on splitting the vhs degeneracy on the charged stripes is discussed . in section",
    "v , these results are compared to experiment , and a consistent model of the photoemission in lsco and bscco is presented .",
    "section vi points out that the model has a qcp  actually , a series of ` magic doping ' qcp s , of which the simplest is the 1/8 anomaly . to illustrate the resulting crossover ,",
    "an additional calculation is presented in section vii , showing how the doping dependence of the spin gap in ybco can be understood .",
    "possible explanations are also presented for the saturation of the incommensurability @xmath11 vs @xmath12 found by yamada , et al.@xcite    section viii includes discussions of the interpretation of the peak - dip - hump structure in bscco , the new stripe - vhs spitting pseudogap , a discussion of fermi surfaces and remnant fermi surfaces in the stripe phase , and comparison with earlier calculations .",
    "a summary of the principal conclusions of this work is given in section ix .",
    "stripe arrays have now been found in a number of oxides , most notably nickelates and manganites .",
    "the similarities of cuprates with nickelates are particularly close : in both systems , the charged stripes act as antiphase boundaries for the magnetic stripes , and in both , the charge order arises at higher temperature than the magnetic order@xcite .",
    "the nickelate stripes run diagonally ( with respect to the ni - o - ni bonds ) ; this is also true of the lsco stripes , in the spin glass regime@xcite , @xmath13 .",
    "however , in the superconducting regime , @xmath14 , the cuprate stripes are generally horizontal and vertical .",
    "one striking difference is that in the nickelates and manganites , the charged stripes correspond to integer doping ( one hole per mn or ni ) , leading to simple patterns@xcite of commensurate stripe arrays .",
    "there are prominent phase transitions at rational fractions , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , corresponding to holes on every @xmath17th row , with evidence for commensurability locking in between ( i.e. , the 1/3 phase persists in an extended doping range about @xmath18 . )",
    "consistent with integer filling , the phases are all insulating@xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the cuprates the phases are all conducting or weakly localized , and the only fraction which appears prominently is 1/8 .    in the present paper ,",
    "a simple explanation is proposed for this distinction .",
    "the charged stripes are fractionally doped , with approximately 1/4 hole per cu ( hence explaining the finite conductivity ) .",
    "the magical 1/8 doping would then correspond to the simplest ` commensurate ' pattern of these stripes .",
    "the stability of the stripe phase decreases in the sequence manganites , nickelates , cuprates .",
    "thus , while there are beautiful electron microscopic images of long - range stripe order in the manganites@xcite , stripes in the cuprates are mainly fluctuating , with only short - range order . within the present model ,",
    "this pattern is readily understood , since the charged stripes are stabilized by cdw instabilities ; this is similar to models for the nickelates and manganites@xcite .",
    "the strength of this instability can be estimated by comparing the strength of electron phonon coupling , which follows the same sequence : manganites ( with well - defined jahn - teller polarons ) , nickelates@xcite , cuprates .",
    "it is only in the cuprates where the interaction is so weak that a fractional occupation can be stabilized , and it is only in the cuprates that the stripe formation is so weak that superconductivity can successfully compete .",
    "hartree - fock calculations@xcite of the tj model find that the holes condense onto domain walls between antiferromagnetically ordered domains , producing fully occupied charge stripes ",
    "one hole per cu .",
    "however , neutron diffraction@xcite finds a charge modulation of periodicity four cu atoms at @xmath19 , which implies only 1/2 hole per cell .",
    "tranquada , et al.@xcite suggested a model for the charged stripes , based on their experience with stripes in nickelates .",
    "the hole - doped stripes are one cell wide , and have a hole on every other site",
    ". a microscopic model for such a domain wall can be derived@xcite by incorporating a charge - density wave ( cdw ) instability along the stripes , treating them as one - dimensional metals . however , such states with integral hole doping are likely to be insulators , as is the case in the stripe phases of the nickelates@xcite , whereas the cuprates are either conducting or weakly localized .",
    "moreover , fractional hole occupation would seem to be more natural for the tj and hubbard models , since the energy of doped holes is lowered by finite hopping @xmath20 in a partially filled band . visscher@xcite and nagaev@xcite showed that the holes enhance their kinetic energy by creating local ferromagnetic domains ( ferrons ) in which they are free to hop .",
    "this leads to a preferred hole density , @xmath21 inside the ferron domain . in a two - dimensional , tj version of the model ( letting @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the lattice constant ) ,",
    "@xmath24 with @xmath25 the number of nearest neighbors of a given cu , and i have assumed @xmath26 .",
    "a similar result was found by nayak and wilczek@xcite .",
    "nagaev s model is a large-@xmath27 theory , and emery and kivelson@xcite extended it to @xmath28 , although they did not address the issue of @xmath21 .",
    "auerbach and larson@xcite showed that a single doped @xmath28 hole will spread out over a ferromagnetic domain covering 5 lattice sites , suggesting a comparable value for @xmath21 , @xmath29 holes per cite , on average ( since the hole has a higher probability of being on the central atom ) .",
    "recent density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations of the tj model undertaken by white and scalapino ( ws)@xcite find charged stripes which are two cu s wide , with an average hole doping of @xmath30 hole per cu on the charged stripes .",
    "these calculations are further discussed in appendix a.    since the charged domains are stabilized by the hole kinetic energy , it is plausible that enhancing the kinetic energy could enhance the stability of the hole - doped stripes .",
    "thus , in a generalized hubbard model , with next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath31 , it is found that a macroscopic ferromagnetic phase is stabilized in the vicinity of the van hove singularity ( vhs)@xcite . moreover , an extended hartree - fock analysis@xcite finds phase separated states smoothly evolving between the afm and fm regions , from a single magnetic polaron to fm stripes to a uniform fm phase .",
    "however , such ferromagnetic domains have not been observed in the cuprates . nevertheless , there are alternative vhs routes to fractionally - occupied stripes .",
    "the large density of states ( dos ) associated with a vhs can drive a large number of competing electronic instabilities@xcite , and it was early suggested that this could be the origin of nanoscale phase separation in the cuprates@xcite . in particular , it was demonstrated that strong electron - phonon coupling could stabilize a charge - density wave phase near the vhs@xcite .      in any model of stripe phase formation based on fermi surface features",
    ", there is a fundamental question of self - consistency : do the features persist in the limit of an isolated stripe ? can one still recognize bulk features of the band structure and fermi surfaces of the phases forming the stripe array ?",
    "this is one of the main issues that this paper resolves : even in the limit of nanoscopic stripes , the band structure is recognizably a superposition of the structures of the two end phases .",
    "the main role of stripe order is to introduce miniband gaps into this structure .    in the particular case of the vhs s , there were a number of preliminary indications which suggested such an affirmative answer .",
    "first , sek@xcite found that an average dispersion persists in the presence of fluctuating stripes ; the resulting ` flat bands ' are a signature of the vhs . secondly , within a group theoretical ( so(6 ) ) model@xcite , the van hove instabilities all remain well - defined on a single plaquette of 2@xmath322 cu atoms , so _ a fortiori _",
    "they should remain well defined on a 2-leg ladder .",
    "indeed , lin , balents , and fisher@xcite found an so(8 ) group controlling the physics of the 2-leg ladder .",
    "when one eliminates@xcite certain one - dimensional operators ( which break the @xmath33 symmetry along the ladder ) , one is left with the same so(6 ) group introduced earlier for the vhs .",
    "such a correspondence would fail for a single - leg ladder .",
    "hence , the present model is restricted to stripes which are an even number of cells ( or cu atoms ) wide .",
    "this point was previously postulated for the magnetic stripes , in terms of spin gaps associated with even - legged ladders@xcite .",
    "moreover , ws find two - cu wide charged stripes in their dmrg calculations@xcite . with this assumption , it is found that a vhs - like feature can be clearly resolved near the fermi level in the stripe phases .",
    "moreover , the stripes provide a new mechanism for vhs splitting  minigaps  which can generate a pseudogap with the correct doping dependence .",
    "while the stripes are likely to be strongly fluctuating , the band structure modifications should be strongest , and can be analyzed in most detail , in an ordered stripe phase .",
    "hence , the present calculation assumes perfectly ordered stripe phases to describe this ` worst case ' scenario .",
    "it will be assumed that there are two preferred hole densities , @xmath34 on the magnetic stripes , and @xmath35 0.25 holes per cu on the hole - doped stripes .",
    "coulomb effects lead to additional charge relaxation , and a more uniform distribution of charge , section iii.d .      in the insulating phase ,",
    "a variant of the spin - density wave ( sdw ) model studied by schrieffer and coworkers@xcite is used .",
    "this model works surprisingly well in the large - u limit@xcite , reproduces the spin wave spectrum of the heisenberg model , and has served as the basis for a number of extended treatments of correlation effects@xcite . for realistic parameters ( @xmath20 , @xmath31 , @xmath36 )",

    "the present model suggests an attractive alternative interpretation for the qcp , as a _ duality crossover _ of the striped phase .",

    "for instance , for the 2d hubbard model , on one side of the qcp there is believed to be a renormalized classical regime , with finite nel order , and on the other side a quantum disordered regime , with a spin zero groundstate and a finite gap to the lowest triplet excitation . instead ,",
    "in the stripe crossover , magnetic layers persist on both sides of the duality crossover .",
    "while both phases persist across the duality point , there is a crossover in the nature of the majority phase ( magnetic or charged ) , and consequently the properties of the minority phase are strongly modified .",
    "because of this , modifications need not occur exactly at the phase boundary .",
    "instead , there strong changes in properties may be observed at any of a series of _ magic dopings _ , corresponding to the commensurate stripe phases discussed above .",
    "for instance , the localization transition in lsco occurs not exactly at x=0.125 , but closer to 0.17 .",
    "this could be understood as evidence that two - leg charged stripes are always localized , but 4-leg stripes are not . for a uniform stripe phase , the two - leg stripes would just disappear at @xmath162 . however , the localization behavior does not seem to be universal : in heavily underdoped ybco , the resistivity of the normal state saturates at low temperatures , suggestive of a metallic state@xcite .    again , the horizontal - vertical stripes are replaced by diagonal stripes at a doping 0.058 , where the superconducting transition terminates .",
    "this is close to the doping of the ( 6,2 ) phase .",

    "a simple interpretation of this result is that superconductivity is predominantly associated with the charged stripes , and the superconducting transition enhances charge phase stiffness , reducing the fluctuations of the charged stripes which were suppressing magnetic order on the magnetic stripes . at higher doping , the magnetic stripes are gradually spread apart , behaving more like two - leg ladders , and",

    "the magnetic correlations have a strong c - axis modulation , suggesting that stripes in both cuo@xmath3 planes of a bilayer run parallel , with the charged stripes offset laterally to provide stronger interlayer screening",
    ".    however , there are other plausible explanations for incommensurability saturation . even before the discovery of stripes",
    ", it was found that lto and ltt domains of fairly large size ( producing distinguishible diffraction peaks ) coexist near 1/8 doping in lbco .",
    "it seems plausible that this is associated with a stripe commensurability effect , similar to that found in the nickelates , and that a similar effect arises , at least incipiently in lsco . in this case , the residual magnetic scattering would be due to regions that have not yet been doped beyond 1/8 . in the more highly doped domains",

    ", one would expect 1/8 lock - in over a finite doping range , when the 2,2 stripes coexist with 2,4 stripes , which have a well defined spin gap . in this case",

    "the special stability of the 1/8 phase may be associated with the finite residual exchange coupling across the two - cell - wide charged stripes , which is responsible for the antiphase boundaries , and which may be lost in wider charged stripes , or with the reduced coulomb energy .    at this stage , there is not enough information to judge between the two models for incommensurability saturation .",

    "however , there is considerable evidence that stripe phase order is better developed in lsco than in other cuprates , and this could provide reason enough for a lower t@xmath136 .",
    "in many ways , optimally doped lsco resembles an underdoped ybco .",
    "we have here suggested that this is because stripes and pseudogaps in both materials persist up to @xmath201 , whereas t@xmath136 is optimal near 0.16 in lsco , 0.2 in ybco .",
    "sato , et al.@xcite have recently provided additional evidence that the pseudogap opens well above t@xmath136 in optimally doped lsco .",
    "the present model of the stripe phase provides a significant advance over earlier calculations . in these early calculations ,",
    "an external stripe potential was imposed , which could be either periodic or random , and the rearrangement of holes was studied .",
    "it was found that the stripes produced minigaps , but that an average , smeared dispersion and fermi surface could still be defined . however , there was no sign of the split dospersion ( magnetic vs charged stripe ) found in photoemission experiments .",
    "the present calculation replaces the external potential with a given , doping dependent potential , and studies how holes redistribute in the presence of a competition between that potential , which favors phase separation , and coulomb repulsion , which favors a uniform density distribution .",
    "the striking result is that the resulting dispersion resembles a weighted superposition of the dispersions of the two end phases , with the addition of some superlattice minigaps .",
    "this is very encouraging , in providing an explanation for the photoemission results .",
    "moreover , it shows that the mechanisms responsible for the special stability of the end phases can continue to operate on these nanoscopic length scales .    a number of improvements still need to be made in the model .",
    "the next step would be to make the calculation fully self - consistent , by eliminating any assumed potential , and directly calculating and minimizing the free energy of the striped phase .",
    "since the dispersion is not greatly changed , it is unlikely that this additional step will greatly modify the present results .",
    "the most likely change would be that the densities could adjust slightly to take advantage of the minigaps , better centering them at the fermi level .",
    "this could lead to a more systematic growth of the pseudogap with underdoping , since the minigaps are associated with the charged stripes , and get larger as these stripes get narrower .",
    "the idea that the pseudogap is associated with stripe minigaps has been proposed previously@xcite ; the present calculation provides a systematic doping dependence and a connection with the vhs .",
    "a complete understanding of the stripe phase , particularly in bscco , lies in the correct inclusion of fluctuation effects .",
    "these effects can broadly be separated into two categories , depending on whether the fluctuation preserves the local density distribution or not . in the former category",
    "fall fluctuations in the local stripe spacing , either static or slowly varying in time , and long - wavelength bending of the stripes .",
    "it is likely that the energy dispersion is a fairly localized function in space , and that these fluctuations can be calculated as weighted averages over the present solutions . in this case",
    ", the dispersion would still be a superposition of the two end phases , and the main effect of the fluctuations would be to smear out the minigaps . since there is always a gap near the fermi level , a residual pseudogap should survive .",
    "moreover , since the split - off lhb is well defined , particularly at lower doping , it should persist at a distinguishible feature after averaging .",
    "this would resemble the photoemission in lsco .",
    "the second class of fluctuations involves fluctuations which are fast enough , or disordered on a sufficiently short - wavelength scale so that the local density does not lie near the two potential minima .",
    "these fluctuations act to wipe out the stripe fluctuations on a local level , and the question is , can they describe the experimental results in bscco , where , for @xmath202 , the two valence bands appear to collapse into a single reconstructed band .",
    "this is a plausible result : as a line of holes fluctuates back and forth in an antiferromagnetic background , the background will have to adjust to some time - averaged hole density .",
    "the theoretical problem is how to properly include this averaging : it is a question of how the system responds locally on different time scales .",
    "it should be noted that the present model has four distinct types of gap in the electronic spectra .",
    "first , there is the mott - hubbard gap in the magnetic stripes , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig:21]a .",
    "then there is the van hove gap on the charged stripes , fig .",
    "[ fig:18 ] .",
    "it is postulated that the opening of these two gaps provides the stabilization energy of the stripe phase , as in fig .",
    "[ fig:16 ] .",
    "however , in addition there is a third type of gap , arising from the new periodicity associated with the stripe phase .",
    "this leads to minigaps in the dispersion across the stripes , clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig:21]b - d .",
    "finally , there is the superconducting gap .",
    "many earlier discussions of the pseudogap relied on the photoemission studies of bscco in the _ normal _ state .",
    "the recent systematic studies in bscco@xcite and lsco@xcite suggest that the low - temperature data are more representative of the stripe phase . in this case ,",
    "[ fig:31 ] shows that there are two distinct features , and the mott - hubbard gap is associated with the ` hump ' feature in bscco ; the ` peak ' feature is then plausibly associated with the charged stripes .",
    "the question then is which of the remaining three theoretical gap features accounts for the ` peak ' .",
    "the doping dependence of the peak feature is not consistent with a conventional superconducting gap : the transition temperature @xmath157 decreases while the peak energy @xmath203 increases with increasing underdoping .",
    "it has been suggested@xcite that @xmath203 is superconductivity - related , but associated with preformed pairs .",
    "however , in the case of a multicomponent order parameter , it has been shown that the total gap at @xmath143 is a vector sum of the individual components . in bscco",
    ", a careful analysis of the data@xcite ( involving the detailed doping dependence of the ` dip ' feature ) suggests that the gap is best interpreted as a superposition of a superconducting component and a non - superconducting component , with the latter dominating in the strongly underdoped limit . accepting this analysis",
    ", the question becomes , what is the origin of the non - superconducting component on the charged stripes ?",
    "the experimental observation that this peak increases as the hole doping decreases can not be easily explained in terms of conventional van hove gaps , which are largest at @xmath68 , figs .",
    "[ fig:16 ] and  [ fig:18a ] . a model involving van hove pinning , introduced@xcite to explain the pseudogap crossover in bscco , relied on the normal - state data , which appeared to show a smooth evolution into the magnetic stripe at half filling .",
    "the model can not explain the evolution of a distinct charge - stripe gap .    on the other hand , the minigaps seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:21 ] do on average grow larger as the doping is reduced , saturating near the 1/8 crossover . in the present , non - self - consistent calculation ,",
    "these minigaps are not centered on the fermi level .",
    "however , it is clear that having @xmath151 fall in a minigap would enhance the energy lowering , stabilizing these gapped phases and improving agreement with experiment .",
    "it should be noted that the greatest energy lowering would correspond to having @xmath151 centered on the minigap closest to the vhs , since that is where the dos is highest , fig .",
    "[ fig:19 ] .",
    "this would then be a form of _ stripe - induced van hove",
    "splitting_.    = 0.44 0.5 cm    = 0.44 0.5 cm    note that the largest minigap is associated with this vhs splitting , even in the lowest doping situation , ( 6,2 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:19b ] shows a blowup of the dos near the fermi level .",
    "it can be seen that there is a gap ( dos = 0 ) for @xmath204 ) , centered at an energy @xmath205 above @xmath206 . for larger @xmath12 a pseudogap ( dos @xmath207 0 ) persists , shifting toward @xmath151 with increasing doping .",
    "since the problem is two dimensional and the stripes are fluctuating , this gap will be spread out into a pseudogap .",
    "nevertheless , the low dos means that localization effects should be present . since the ( pseudo)gap remains large at the 1/8 crossover",
    ", there should be a delocalization transition at a somewhat higher doping . in the present calculation",
    ", this feature falls above the fermi level ; however , this could change in a fully self consistent calculation .",
    "finally , one should note the duality between the charge stripe minigap , which grows as hole doping is reduced , fig .",
    "[ fig:31 ] , and the magnetic stripe spin gap , which increases with increasing hole doping , fig .  [ fig:7 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig:22 ] shows the fermi surfaces corresponding to the same dopings as in fig .",
    "[ fig:21 ] .",
    "as expected from the ` projected ' dispersions in that figure , in all cases the wave functions are @xmath208 associated with the charged stripes .",
    "note the important role of the structure factors : while there is a well - defined superlattice in each case , and hence each fermi surface segment is periodically repeated , the weight is highly nonuniformly distributed , being concentrated predominantly near the limiting x=0.25 fermi surface ( solid line in the figures ) .",
    "feng , et al.@xcite recently presented photoemission evidence for the presence of _ two _ fermi surfaces in bscco , seen at different incident photon energies .",
    "this result is disputed@xcite , but it is intriguing that the ` new ' fermi surface has large flat sections , very similar to the 1/8 stripe pattern , fig .",

    "while the intensity does fall to half at the fermi level , it can also fall to half at an energy away from the fermi level ( n.b .",

    ", a rfs was found for the insulating ccoc .",
    "we have shown that in this case the rfs ( the locus of points where the coherence factor equals one half ) maps out the superlattice zone boundary .",
    "( since the model does not include fluctuations , there is only one band below @xmath151 , and hence no photoemission distribution to integrate over . )    in the case of a stripe array , there are several complications .",
    "first , there are several subbands , and one will get different results depending on whether one calculates an rfs for each subband , or a single rfs for the whole valence band .",

    "= 0.44 0.5 cm      a test case for phase separation models of stripe formation comes from measurements on oxygen - doped la@xmath3cuo@xmath210 . in these materials ,",
    "the interstitial oxygens are highly mobile , so the tendency of holes to phase separate leads to _ macroscopic _ phase separation . as in graphite intercalation compounds ( gic )",
    ", this is accomplished by staging@xcite : the interstitial oxygens form dense layers , with subsequent oxygen layers separated by n layers of cuo@xmath3 ( n is the stage number ) .",
    "the puzzling observation@xcite is that despite the macroscopic phase separation , stripes are still found in these compounds .",
    "i suggest the following resolution , also based on an analogy with gic . the stripes were observed in a predominantly stage 4 compound , with 4 cuo@xmath3 layers per oxygen interstitial layer . in gic",
    ", a stage 4 would have a highly inhomogeneous charge distribution , with most of the charge on the bounding layers ( in this case , the cuo@xmath3 layers adjacent to the interstitial o s ) , and significantly less on the interior layers , away from the o s .",
    "hence , in the cuprate i propose a similar effect : fully charged @xmath201 bounding layers , and lighter charged @xmath211 interior layers .",
    "thus , the staging is driven by the tendency to phase separate , producing ideal hole - doped bounding layers , but there are still stripes due to doping of the interior layer .",
    "this model resolves two additional problems .",
    "first , the sample was a mixture of stages 2 and 4 .",
    "if the doped holes were uniformly distributed on all cuo@xmath3 layers , then there would be _ two independent stripe patterns _ , since the stage 2 cuo@xmath3 planes would have nearly twice as many holes per layer . within the present model ,",
    "most of the charge goes into the bounding layer , so the layers of stage 2 would have comparable doping to the bounding layers of stage 4 ; moreover , since both types of layers are nearly fully doped , neither would show magnetic scattering .",
    "finally , even though static stripe order was observed , there was no reduction in t@xmath136  indeed , t@xmath136=42k is higher than can be obtained with sr doping .",
    "this can most easily be understood if the superconductivity and the stripe order are in different layers .",
    "it is instructive to compare the present results with earlier slave boson calculations . in the simplest version",
    ", there is no magnetic coupling , @xmath212 , and the band structure near the mott transition is highly anomalous .",
    "there is a single band , but as the doping approaches half filling , @xmath213 , the bandwidth vanishes , with both @xmath20 and @xmath31 renormalized to zero . in the three - band model , even after setting @xmath214 , there is still a charge transfer energy , @xmath215 in this case , it is also possible to approach half filling from below , @xmath216 ; the same bandwidth collapse occurs , but at a different energy , @xmath217 , with @xmath218 being the ( renormalized ) charge transfer energy .",
    "is there any way to reconcile the present results with slave boson theory ?",
    "i suggest the following possibility .",
    "when a hole is doped into the mott insulator , there is phase separation , and locally the dispersion is restored : @xmath219 . at a doping @xmath12 , a fraction @xmath220 of the electrons have hopping @xmath221 , the rest @xmath222 .",
    "but in the mean - field slave boson calculation the effect of the hole is uniformly spread out over the entire lattice , leading to an effective @xmath223 .",
    "this is just what is found in the present stripe calculation .",
    "as the material is doped , the magnetic band persists with little change , while a new band appears , characteristic of the hole - doped stripes , with full bandwidth , @xmath224 ( neglecting superlattice gaps ) , but with relative intensity proportional to @xmath12 , fig .",
    "[ fig:21 ] .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , it suggests that the slave boson calculation may underestimate the tendency for phase separation .",
    "a number of calculations@xcite interpret the magnetic stripe dispersion in terms of a flux phase rather than an antiferromagnet .",
    "this is unsatisfactory for two reasons : first , there is clear evidence that the magnetic stripes have predominantly antiferromagnetic correlations ; and secondly , the flux phase has zero gap at @xmath154 , making it difficult to explain the dispersion in scoc , which has a gap @xmath225 .",
    "the present calculation is based on an antiferromagnetic model , which corrects both of these defects .",
    "the dispersion in the presence of stripes has also been calculated by sek@xcite and by seibold , et al.@xcite .",
    "these calculations were intended simply to show the effect of charge ( or spin ) modulations on the quasiparticle dispersion and involve highly simplified models for stripes .",
    "sek introduced a background stripe potential , @xmath226 , which fixed the orientation and periodicity of the stripe array , and induced a modulation in the quasiparticle charge and spin densities .",
    "seibold , et al .",
    "concentrate on the charge modulation , and introduce a cdw model , again with externally imposed periodicity .",
    "while these calculations demonstrated how the modulation introduces pseudogaps into the dispersion , they are not expected to give a very good picture of stripes arising from an underlying phase separation instability .",
    "a cdw model involves a _ fixed periodicity _ and a _ variable density _ , whereas phase separation should produce an approximately fixed density and smoothly varying periodicity .",
    "thus , in the present calculations , it is straightforward to model the full doping dependence of the stripe phase ; in the earlier calculations , the doping dependence of the periodicity and potential must be supplied empirically , so the models can make no predictions .",
    "thus , neither calculation showed any sign of the separate magnetic and charge bands .",
    "one should note a distinction between the way the idea of cdw s is applied in these calculations and the usage of the present paper . in the earlier calculations@xcite ,",
    "the charge modulation of the stripes _ is _ the cdw .",
    "in contrast , the present paper envisages cdw s ( or related phonon anomalies , such as the ltt phase ) as existing on the charged stripes , leading to two inequivalent sublattices  much as antiferromagnetism leads to two sublattices on the magnetic stripes .",
    "in a recent paper , pryadko , et al.@xcite presented a detailed criticism of the early hartree - fock calculations of stripes . in these calculations ,",
    "the stripes are claimed to arise from fermi surface nesting , so some of the criticisms apply to a larger class of models .",
    "here , i would like to take issue with some of the statements .",
    "first , pryadko , et al .",
    "state `` the density of holes along a stripe varies continuously as a function of @xmath12 '' , citing yamada , et al.@xcite .",
    "while this is mainly associated with the saturation of the incommensurability above @xmath12=1/8 , they note that the data at lower doping also show some curvature , suggestive of a ` slight variation ' of the doping .",
    "this is mainly associated with the cutoff of incommensurability below @xmath227 , but that data have now been superseded by better samples : the stripes are present , but rotated by 45@xmath199 , and the incommensurability falls close to the yamada ( straight ) line . as discussed above , both a slight doping - dependence below @xmath184 , and a stronger saturation above that doping _",
    "can _ be understood in a model with a prefered charged stripe density , in the presence of either long - range coulomb repulsion ( which can produce a _",
    "real _ saturation of the incommensurability ) or commensurability pinning ( which produces an _",
    "apparent _ saturation ) .",
    "pryadko , et al . further state , `` in the lsco family , ... , there is simply no vestige of a quasiparticle in the region of momentum space where the nested fermi surface is supposed to occur . ''",
    "this statement raises several issues .",
    "first , one must carefully distinguish conventional fermi surface nesting from van hove nesting .",
    "for the conventional nesting model@xcite they cite , the nesting is associated with flat sections of fermi surface ; in lsco these flat sections arise near@xcite @xmath154 , where there _ are _ well - defined quasiparticles .",
    "conversely , the fact that these quasiparticles persist in the striped phase shows that they are not involved in the nesting process .",
    "in contrast , in van hove nesting the important quasiparticles are those near @xmath143 . in all the cuprates ,",
    "these quasiparticles are found to be shifted below the fermi level , and indeed _ a comparison of photoemission and tunneling studies reveals that the position of these quasiparticles defines the pseudogap _  exactly as required by a van hove nesting theory .",
    "moreover , even in the sek calculation it was clear that these van hove quasiparticles , which constitute the ` flat bands ' remain well defined in the calculated striped phase .",
    "this is further clear from , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig:21 ] above .",
    "true the quasiparticles are greatly smeared out , but this is a direct consequence of the formation of stripes , and can not be taken as an argument against this mechanism of stripe formation .",
    "finally , stojkovi and pines@xcite claimed to rule out the vhs in the physics of the cuprates .",
    "they employed parameters for which the vhs falls at very high doping , @xmath228 , and concluded  the presence of the van hove singularities near the fermi surface plays only a marginal role \" .",
    "however , their more recent calculations@xcite employ a revised parameter set ( i.e. , @xmath229 ) , which places the vhs at @xmath230 , close to the present @xmath78 .",
    "this has been a long manuscript , which presents a coherent view of the stripe phases in the cuprates .",
    "a number of principal results of the calculations are here summarized .",
    "most of the results are _ generic _ , and would be expected in any model where the stripes result from two - phase coexistence , while a few are specific to a van hove scenario .",
    "\\(1 ) this is the first calculation of photoemission in the stripe phase involving strong stripe correlations , i.e. , preferred hole dopings with independent characteristic dispersions , as opposed to a single dispersion with sinusoidal ( cdw / sdw ) modulations .",
    "\\(2 ) this allows a study of the evolution of the dispersion as a function of hole doping .",
    "\\(3 ) it is found that , even at this nanoscale level , the dispersion can be characterized as a _ superposition of two components _ , leading to a picture of magnetic stripe bands and hole - doped ( ` charged ' ) stripe bands .",
    "this allows a natural interpretation of the photoemission spectra in lsco , and suggests a unified picture with bscco and scoc .",
    "\\(4 ) the calculations suggest that an important role of the superconducting transition is to freeze out fluctuations of the stripes .",
    "this freezeout manifests itself in three ways : ( a ) the electron - electron scattering rate drops by several orders of magnitude below t@xmath136@xcite ; ( b ) the photoemission dispersion splits in bscco into a characteristic peak - dip - hump structure ; ( c ) the @xmath9 magnetic neutron scattering in ybco sharpens below t@xmath136 , revealing a characteristic spin gap .",
    "\\(5 ) the doping dependence naturally leads to a picture of a series of _ quantum critical points _ ( qcp s ) or magic dopings ,",
    "at which the stripe pattern is commensurate with the crystalline lattice .",
    "the most prominent one is the famous 1/8 effect , but the metal - insulator transition in lsco and the onset of superconductivity are close to two other magic numbers .",
    "\\(6 ) the percolation crossover at 1/8 doping provides a simple model of the spin gap in ybco , showing that a two - leg ladder provides a good model for an isolated magnetic stripe .",
    "\\(7 ) as a result of point ( 3 ) , the model has a _ natural vhs pinning _ to the fermi level : if the vhs is at the fermi level in the charged stripe end phase ( as it must be , if this phase is stabilized by van hove nesting ) , then the vhs remains close to @xmath151 over the entire doping range .",
    "\\(8 ) this provides a new explanation of the pseudogap : _ stripe - induced van hove splitting_.    \\(9 ) more speculatively , since superconductivity in ybco is strongest well beyond the percolation crossover ( 1/8 effect ) , _ superconductivity seems to be a property predominantly of the charged stripes_.    there are a number of advantages of the present model of fractionally - doped stripes .",
    "first , if the stripes are stabilized by cdw formation , then there is an important continuity between stripes in the cuprates , and those in the nickelates and manganites .",
    "such continuity is lost in the so(5 ) model , where the charged stripes are stabilized by superconductivity . moreover",

    "inclusion of realistic values of @xmath31 into the model further reduces the stripe stability@xcite .",

    "hence , the narrowest possible magnetic stripes are two cells wide .    given these assumptions , the ws data can be explained as follows . in the low doping regime ,",
    "hole doped stripes form with the minimal width of two cells , and 0.25 holes per cu , for a net of 0.5 holes per unit length .",

    "these results are consistent with the three - dimensional calculations of dichtel , et al.@xcite .      interpreting the doping dependence of @xmath148 as a measure of the renormalization of the _ splitting _ into upper and lower hubbard bands , the mean - field calculations are in good agreement with exact diagonalization calculations@xcite and experiments on the cuprates@xcite .",
    "figures [ fig : b2]-[fig : b5 ] show how the dispersion changes with doping .",
    "for all curves , the same band parameters , given below eq .",
    "[ eq : a2 ] , are used , with @xmath55 found self consistently . surprisingly , the results are qualitatively consistent with the pseudogap in the underdoped cuprates ( @xmath32 s , diamonds , and squares)@xcite , even though no striped phases are assumed .",
    "however , the predicted hole doping is anomalously large .        in the undoped material",
    ", the model has a direct ( indirect ) mott - hubbard gap of 1.63ev ( 1.27ev ) , and reproduces the dispersion found in the oxyclorides@xcite , fig .",
    "[ fig : b2 ] .",
    "here @xmath239 , @xmath240 , and @xmath241 .",
    "the spectral weight is proportional to the coherence factor @xmath242 with the subscript @xmath133 ( @xmath243 ) referring to the upper ( lower ) hubbard band . from fig .",
    "[ fig : b2 ] it can be seen that the coherence factor is @xmath244 all along the @xmath245 branch , where no quasiparticle peaks were reported .",
    "the weight along the line @xmath246 is uniformly 1/2 , characteristic of the antiferromagnetic zone boundary@xcite .        in studies of the fermi surfaces of the hole - doped cuprates",
    ", there is an important question as to whether the fermi surfaces are large , centered on @xmath150 , or small hole pockets , centered at @xmath247 , and equivalent points . in dispersion studies , the hole pockets are associated with retrograde dispersion branches of low intensity ( ghosts ) , particularly along @xmath245 and @xmath248 .",
    "note that this negative curvature along the branch @xmath245 is clearly seen for underdoped samples with @xmath249@xcite , fig .",
    "[ fig : b3 ] .",
    "[ parenthetically , the striking difference in doping for the two data sets in this figure arises because marshall , et al.@xcite are plotting the normal state pseudogap , while campuzano , et al.@xcite plot the hump feature in the superconducting state . ]    for these parameters , the transition to the paramagnetic phase is first order ; for other parameter choices , a second - order transition is found .",
    "the first order transition is a topological transition , arising when the fermi level crosses the band dispersion near @xmath125 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : b5 ] ) .",
    "this is rather striking , since topological transitions are typically rather weak  of order 2.5 .",
    "a similar result was found in the hubbard model ( @xmath250 ) by guinea , et al.@xcite .",
    "thus , the dispersion of the normal state pseudogap , as seen in photoemission , can be well described by a uniform doping of the magnetic phase , in the absence of stripes .",
    "this has been noted by a number of groups , including schmalian , et al.@xcite , and misra , et al.@xcite .",
    "however , this can not be the complete interpretation .",
    "tunneling studies clearly demonstrate that the pseudogap consists of two components , split approximately symmetrically about the fermi level .",
    "the uniform phase dispersion describes the feature _ below _ the fermi level , but the model contains no corresponding feature above the fermi level .",

    "<S> a phase separation model is presented for the stripe phase of the cuprates , which allows the doping dependence of the photoemission spectra to be calculated . </S>",

    "<S> the dispersion can be interpreted as essentially a superposition of the two end - phase dispersions , with superposed minigaps associated with the lattice periodicity . </S>",
    "<S> the largest minigap falls near the fermi level ; it can be enhanced by proximity to a ( bulk ) van hove singularity . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated spectra are dominated by two features  this charge stripe minigap plus the magnetic stripe hubbard gap . </S>",
    "<S> there is a strong correlation between these two features and the experimental photoemission results of a two - peak dispersion in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , and the peak - dip - hump spectra in bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath4 . </S>",
