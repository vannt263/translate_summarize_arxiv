    "<S> in this paper , the tracking control problem of a class of uncertain euler - lagrange systems subjected to unknown input delay and bounded disturbances is addressed . to this front , a novel delay dependent control law , referred as adaptive robust outer loop control ( arolc ) is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the conventional predictor based approaches , the proposed controller is capable of negotiating any input delay , within a stipulated range , without knowing the delay or its variation . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum allowable input delay is computed through razumikhin - type stability analysis . </S>",
    "<S> arolc also provides robustness against the disturbances due to input delay , parametric variations and unmodelled dynamics through switching control law . </S>",
    "<S> the novel adaptive law allows the switching gain to modify itself online in accordance with the tracking error without any prerequisite of the uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertain system , employing arolc , is shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded ( uub ) . </S>",
    "<S> as a proof of concept , experimentation is carried out on a nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot with various time varying as well as fixed input delay , and better tracking accuracy of the proposed controller is noted compared to predictor based methodology .    </S>",
