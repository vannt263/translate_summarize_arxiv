    "the definition of the hamiltonian constraint operator in loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) is far from unique .",
    "the non - uniqueness stems from the tension between the local nature of the hamiltonian constraint and the non- local nature of some of the basic operators used in its construction .",
    "specifically , the hamiltonian constraint depends on the curvature @xmath0 of the ashtekar- barbero connection whereas the basic connection dependent operators are holonomies of the connection around spatial loops .",
    "while , classically , the curvature can be obtained through a limit of small loop holonomies wherein the small loop shrinks down to a point , quantum mechanically , the action of the corresponding holonomy operators in lqg does not have the recquisite continuity for the limit to exist .",
    "hence , one proceeds as follows @xcite .",
    "a triangulation of the 3 manifold is chosen and a finite triangulation approximant to the hamiltonian constraint is constructed from finite triangulation approximants to the local fields which comprise it . the exact hamiltonian constraint is only obtained in the continuum limit of infinitely fine triangulation . due to the discontinuous action of the holonomy operators , it turns out that the continuum limit of the finite triangulation approximant to the constraint ( which we will refer to as the `` constraint at finite triangulation '' ) depends on the detailed choices of holonomy approximants to @xmath0 at finite triangulation .",
    "it follows that an issue of crucial importance is whether one can somehow restrict the choices of these holonomy approximants and settle on a less ambiguous definition of the quantum dynamics of lqg .",
    "there are broadly two aspects to the choice of holonomy approximants .",
    "the first is related to the choice of representation used to evaluate the holonomy @xcite , the second to the choice of small loop around which the holonomy is evaluated .",
    "the current state of art uses a fixed spin ( usually spin half ) representation and a choice of little loop only restricted by the ( slightly subjective ) criterion of simplicity @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , calculations in simpler contexts suggest that these choices may be physically inappropriate .",
    "on the one hand a detailed study of parameterized field theory @xcite suggests that the representation of the small loop holonomy be tailored to that of spin network edge it acts upon . on the other studies of isotropic loop quantum cosmology ( lqc)@xcite suggest that the specification of the size of the small loop should involve the electric flux operator .",
    "thus , not only is the definition of the hamiltonian constraint operator in lqg highly choice dependent , it may also be the case that the current set of choices are physically inappropriate .    in this work ,",
    "we seek insight into the nature of the ( possibly ) correct set of choices through an analysis of the diffeomorphism constraint .",
    "the diffeomorphism constraint in lqg is handled very differently from the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "lqg kinematics provides a unitary representation of finite spatial diffeomorphisms @xcite .",
    "the diffeomorphism constraint is not imposed directly but , rather , by demanding that states be invariant under the action of these unitary operators .",
    "indeed , the ( putative ) generator of these unitary operators ( which would correspond to the diffeomorphism constraint ) is not even defined on kinematic states because of the lack of weak continuity of the unitaries .    here",
    ", we treat the diffeomorphism constraint in a manner similar to the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "accordingly , we fix a triangulation of the 3- manifold and seek finite triangulation approximants to the various local fields which make up the diffeomorphism constraint , construct the diffeomorphism constraint at finite triangulation and then take its continuum limit .",
    "since we know the action of _ finite _ diffeomorphisms , our choice of finite triangulation approximants is guided by the requirement that the finite triangulation diffeomorphism constraint have an action of the form @xmath1 here @xmath2 parameterizes the fineness of the triangulation as well as the size of the diffeomorphism @xmath3 generated by the shift vector @xmath4 , @xmath5 denotes the unitary operator corresponding to the diffeomorphism @xmath6 and the continuum limit is defined by @xmath7 .",
    "this requirement , while natural in itself , is also strongly motivated by our previous studies of pft @xcite . finally , we define the continuum limit of the finite triangulation diffeomorphism constraint operator on the lewandowski- marolf ( lm ) habitat @xcite and check its physical appropriateness by showing that the algebra of diffeomorphism constraint operators on this habitat is anomaly free .",
    "we shall see that the choice of approximant to the @xmath8 term in the diffeomorphism constraint reflects similarities both with the choices made in pft @xcite as well as ( at least at a conceptual level ) lqc @xcite .    in the next section we outline the steps in our construction and detail the plan of the paper .",
    "before doing so , we would like to acknowledge the importance of early pioneering works on the diffeomorphism constraint in the context of the loop representation @xcite in providing inspiration and encouragement for the more rigorous work done here , specifically the works of bruegmann and pullin @xcite and blencowe @xcite .",
    "there , the diffeomorphism constraint was shown to generate infinitesmal diffeomorphisms in quantum theory under a certain assumption of regularity of the wave functions ( which is violated in the current , rigorous formulation of the theory ) .",
    "it is also pertinent to mention thiemann s work @xcite on the specific form of the diffeomorphism constraint which appears as the poisson bracket between a pair of smeared density one hamiltonian constraints .",
    "there too , a factor which is the difference between a finite diffeomorphism unitary operator and the identity is obtained .. as seen in @xcite and emphasized in our concluding section , the absence of this factor yields a trivial action of the operator on the lm habitat . ] from the point of view of our work here , the derivation @xcite neglects certain contributions which are of `` order 1 '' in the hilbert space norm .",
    "nevertheless , thiemann s work is remarkable in that it represents the first attempt to tackle the diffeomorphism constraint in the modern formulation of lqg .",
    "the purpose of this section is to sketch the main steps in the construction so as to give the reader a rough global view of the logic ; the discussion will be schematic and the reader should not be perturbed if it does not follow the sketch in detail . in this section",
    "we shall set @xmath9 .",
    "since our discussion in this section is schematic , we shall further simplify our presentation by choosing the barbero- immirizi parameter @xmath10 to be unity ( only ! ) in this section .",

    "our desired result is : @xmath29 where , @xmath30 is the image of @xmath22 by the diffeomorphism @xmath31 which translates @xmath22 by an amount @xmath2 along the integral curves of the shift vector field @xmath32 ( see fig 1a ) .",
    "fig 1a    we obtain the desired result through the following steps : + ( i ) first we set @xmath33 ( ii ) next , we show that @xmath34 here @xmath35 has the same end points as @xmath22 ( as it must by virtue of the gauge invariance of @xmath36 ) and is obtained by joining the end points of @xmath30 to those of @xmath22 by a pair of segments which are aligned with integral curves of @xmath32 as shown in fig 1b .",

    "we order the triad operator to the right in @xmath43 so that only those 3- cells contribute which intersect @xmath22 .",
    "the triangulation @xmath18 is adapted to the edge @xmath22 so that its restriction to @xmath22 defines a triangulation of @xmath22 .",
    "thus , there is a triangulation of @xmath22 by 1- cells and vertices of @xmath18 so that each of these vertices @xmath44 is located at the centre of some 3- cell @xmath45 .",
    "we define a finite triangulation approximant to @xmath0 in a such a way that the following identity holds : @xmath46 @xmath47 .",

    "fig-1d    next , we show that the contributions from all the @xmath52 yield the edge @xmath35 of fig 1b . recall that @xmath38 is obtained by summing over all the cell contributions @xmath39",

    "@xmath54 , the sum over @xmath40 is first converted to a _ product _ over @xmath40",
    "i.e. to leading order in @xmath2 , we show that @xmath55 hence , replacing the sum over the corresponding operators by the product provides an equally legitimate definition of @xmath56 .",
    "the replacement then leads , modulo some details , to the following identity @xmath57 our definition of @xmath52 is such that each factor in the product acts independently , the @xmath58th factor acting only on the part of @xmath22 between @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "the diffeomorphism constraint @xmath11 generates diffeomorphisms along the integral curves of the shift vector field @xmath4 .",
    "hence , one expects the quantum constraint operator , @xmath458 , to have a non- trivial action at _ all _ the ( infintely many ) points lying on those edges of a spin network state which are transverse to @xmath4 . in contrast , almost all operators of significance in lqg have a non- trivial action only at a _",
    "finite _ number of points namely the vertices of the graph underlying the spin network state .",
    "indeed , the necessity of an action at infinitely many points was thought to be an obstacle to the construction of the operator @xmath458 @xcite .",
    "our construction gets around this obstruction through the reformulation of the classical constraint at finite triangulation as a _ product _ over 3- cells of the triangulation described in section 4 .",
    "this leads , in the quantum theory , to a _",
    "product _ of bounded operators at finite triangulation rather than a _",
    "sum_. the product admits a satisfactory continuum limit whereas the sum does not .",
    "thus , it is the passage to the product form which enables us to deal with the contributions from infinitely many points in the continuum limit .",
    "a sensible product reformulation also seems to require that the shift vector @xmath468 can not appear as an overall factor multiplying the diffeomorphism constraint @xmath469 at the point @xmath64 because a product over all @xmath64 of shift vectors at each point @xmath64 is not an object which makes sense in the continuum limit .",
    "hence it seems inevitable that the shift vector dependence in @xmath11 at finite triangulation is taken care of by the incorporation of both its direction and magnitude in the specification of the small loop which underlies the holonomy approximant to the ashtekar- barbero curvature , @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , what we are able to construct is the quantity @xmath8 at finite triangulation rather than @xmath0 itself . as a consequence ,",
    "our construction of curvature approximant bears a great conceptual similarity to that of loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) when viewed in the following manner .    in isotropic lqc ,",
    "the diffeomorphism constraint is satisfied identically and the hamiltonian constraint reduces to its euclidean part @xmath470 where we have used standard notation for the densitized triad and the determinant of the 3- metric .",
    "our work here suggests that rather than @xmath0 it is @xmath471 which needs to be approximated at finite triangulation , and , that one should attempt to incorporate @xmath472 as part of the specification of the small loop underlying the holonomy approximant . in the quantum theory such an attempt , if successful , would lead to the consideration of a loop whose size depends on the triad operator , thus exhibiting a close conceptual similarity to the `` @xmath473 '' scheme @xcite for the hamiltonian constraint in lqc .",
    "setting aside considerations of the hamiltonian constraint , this work in itself ( as seen in section 5 ) reveals the necessity of a triad operator dependence in the construction of curvature approximants .",
    "this dependence is both explicit ( as seen in the occurence of the electric flux terms in equations ( [ eq:(4 ) ] ) and ( [ eq:16 ] ) ) as well as implicit in that the expressions for the curvature approximants depend on the spin label @xmath23 of the edge on which the curvature operator acts .",
    "label specifies the eigen values of the area operator which is built from the triads @xcite . ] a similar dependence of `` connection '' type operators on conjugate `` electric fluxes '' was also seen to be crucial in recent work on polymer parameterised field theory ( ppft ) @xcite .",
    "apart from this `` electric flux dependence '' , one of the key lessons of our work in ppft @xcite is the necessity of considering kinematically _ singular _ constraint operators in order to obtain a non- trivial representation of the constraint algebra . here ,",
    "too , the existence of a non- trivial representation of the quantum constraint algebra can be traced to the kinematically singular nature of the diffeomorphism constraint operator . that this operator is singular on @xmath474",
    "is an obvious consequence of the factor of @xmath475 in equation ( [ final ] ) .",
    "it is this factor which leads to a non- trivial representation of the constraint algebra on the lm habitat in section 8 .",
    "had this factor been absent the action of the constraint operator would have yielded the difference of the evaluations of a vertex smooth function at points seperated by @xmath2 .",
    "this difference vanishes in the @xmath7 limit by virtue of the smoothness of the function .",
    "instead , just as for ppft @xcite , the factor of @xmath476 converts this difference into a derivative in the continuum limit , thus yielding a non- trivial action of the diffeomorphism constraint operator on the habitat as well as a non- trivial representation of the algebra of diffeomorphism constraints thereon .",
    "our final goal is the construction of the hamiltonian constraint operator in such a way as to obtain a non- trivial anomaly free representation of its algebra . in the language of the concluding section of reference @xcite ,",
    "let us refer to the quantum commutator between a pair of hamiltonian constraints as the left hand side ( lhs ) and the quantum correspondent of the classical poisson bracket between this pair as the right hand side ( rhs ) .",
    "the rhs is closely related to the diffeomorphism constraint operators studied here ; the only difference being that the shift vector field in the rhs is operator valued . earlier work by thiemann @xcite , lewandowski and marolf @xcite and gambini , lewandowski , pullin and marolf @xcite showed that for density weight one hamiltonian constraints , the algebra consistently trivialises i.e. the lhs and the rhs can be independently defined either with respect to the uniform rovelli- smolin- thiemann topology on @xmath474 @xcite or on the lm habitat @xcite and , in both cases , both the rhs and the lhs vanish .",
    "our work on ppft @xcite ( as well as the ` rescaling by hand ' in reference @xcite ) suggests the use of higher density weight constraints to probe the existence of a _",
    "non- trivial _ representation of the constraint algebra .",
    "both these works also suggest that the current set of choices for curvature approximants are inappropriate . as emphasized in reference @xcite the current set of choices used in the lhs do not result in an rhs which can move vertices by diffeomorphisms .",
    "since the choice of curvature approximants used in this work does result in the diffeomorphism constraint moving vertices around by diffeomorphisms , the considerations of this work should be of use for a better understanding of both the lhs as well as the rhs .",

    "<S> we construct the smeared diffeomorphism constraint operator at finite triangulation from the basic holonomy- flux operators of loop quantum gravity , evaluate its continuum limit on the lewandowski- marolf habitat and show that the action of the continuum operator provides an anomaly free representation of the lie algebra of diffeomorphisms of the 3- manifold . </S>",
    "<S> key features of our analysis include : ( i ) finite triangulation approximants to the curvature , @xmath0 of the ashtekar- barbero connection which involve not only small loop holonomies but also small surface fluxes as well as an explicit dependence on the edge labels of the spin network being acted on ( ii ) the dependence of the small loop underlying the holonomy on both the direction and magnitude of the shift vector field ( iii ) continuum constraint operators which do _ not _ have finite action on the kinematic hilbert space , thus implementing a key lesson from recent studies of parameterised field theory by the authors .    features ( i ) and ( ii ) provide the first hints in lqg of a conceptual similarity with the so called `` mu- bar '' scheme of loop quantum cosmology . </S>",
