    "we present a general framework for solving quasilinear wave equations with _ normally hyperbolic trapping _ , which extends the semilinear framework developed by the two authors in @xcite and the _ non - trapping _ quasilinear theory developed by the first author @xcite .    for concreteness ,",
    "let us describe the relevant features for the setup of our result on kerr - de sitter space .",
    "the region of kerr - de sitter space we are interested in can be considered a ( non - compact ) @xmath0-dimensional manifold with boundary @xmath1 , with the boundary being an ` ideal boundary ' at infinity in the standard description of kerr - de sitter space .",
    "@xmath1 is equipped with a lorentzian b - metric @xmath2 , recalled below , depending on three parameters @xmath3 ( the cosmological constant ) , @xmath4 ( the black hole mass ) and @xmath5 , the angular momentum , though we usually drop this in the notation .",
    ", @xmath1 and @xmath5 are such that the non - degeneracy condition ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 6.2 ) ) holds , which in particular ensures that the cosmological horizon lies outside the black hole event horizon .",
    "] recall that on any @xmath6-dimensional manifold with boundary @xmath1 , the lie algebra of smooth vector fields tangent to the boundary is denoted by @xmath7 ; in local coordinates @xmath8 , with @xmath9 a boundary defining function , these are linear combinations of @xmath10 and @xmath11 with @xmath12 coefficients , and thus they are the space of all @xmath13 sections of a vector bundle , @xmath14 , with local basis @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "a b - metric is a non - degenerate symmetric bilinear form on the fibers of @xmath14 smoothly depending on the base point ; a lorentzian b - metric is one of signature @xmath15 .    in order to set up our problem , we consider two functions @xmath16 , @xmath17 , with forward , resp .",
    "backward , time - like differentials near their respective @xmath18-set @xmath19 , which are linearly independent at their joint @xmath18-set , and let @xmath20 , with @xmath21 compact , so @xmath21 is a compact manifold with corners with three boundary hypersurfaces @xmath22 and @xmath23 , all intersected with @xmath21 .",
    "we are interested in solving the forward problem for wave - like equations in @xmath21 , i.e.  imposing vanishing cauchy data at @xmath24 , which we assume is disjoint from @xmath25 ; initial value problems with general cauchy data can always be converted into an equation of this type .    , the cauchy hypersurface @xmath24 and the hypersurface @xmath26 , which has two connected components which lie beyond the cosmological horizon and beyond the black hole event horizon , respectively .",
    "the horizons at @xmath25 themselves are the projections to the base of the ( generalized ) radial sets @xmath27 , discussed below , each of which has two components , corresponding to the two horizons .",
    "the projection to the base of the bicharacteristic flow is indicated near a point on @xmath28 ; near @xmath29 , the directions of the flowlines are reversed .",
    "lastly , @xmath30 is the trapped set , and the projection of a trapped trajectory approaching @xmath30 within @xmath31 , discussed below , is indicated . ]    in such a b - setting , one measures regularity with respect to @xmath7 , and for non - negative integer @xmath32 , one lets @xmath33 be the set of ( complex - valued ) @xmath34 such that @xmath35 for @xmath36 and @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 is the @xmath39-space with respect to any b - metric , such as the kerr - de sitter metric .",
    "further , one introduces the weighted b - sobolev spaces @xmath40 .",
    "sections of vector bundles in @xmath41 are defined by local trivializations ; the sobolev spaces on @xmath21 are defined by restriction .",
    "we point out that the b - differential @xmath42 , defined locally by @xmath43 maps @xmath44 to @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the dual bundle of @xmath14 .",
    "we are typically interested in real - valued solutions ; @xmath47 , etc . , denotes these spaces , and @xmath42 preserves preserves reality .",
    "the wave equations we consider include those of the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 , and for each @xmath50 , @xmath51 , depending smoothly on @xmath52 , and is only relevant if @xmath53 . ]",
    "@xmath54    our central result in the form which is easiest to state is , with a more general version given below in theorems  [ thmintrogeneralkg ] and [ thmintrogeneralwave ] :    [ thmintrowave ] ( see corollaries  [ corquasilinearkds ] and [ corquasilinearkgkds ] . ) on kerr - de sitter space with angular momentum @xmath55 , for @xmath56 sufficiently small , @xmath57 with sufficiently small @xmath58-norm , the wave equation @xmath59 , with @xmath60 as above with @xmath61 for all @xmath62 , has a unique smooth global forward solution of the form @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 identically @xmath67 near @xmath68 .",
    "further , the analogous conclusion holds for the klein - gordon equation @xmath69 with @xmath70 sufficiently small , without the presence of the @xmath71 term , i.e.  for @xmath72 sufficiently small , if @xmath73 with sufficiently small @xmath58-norm , @xmath74 has a unique smooth global forward solution @xmath75 .",
    "in fact , for klein - gordon equations one can also obtain a leading term , analogously to @xmath71 , which now has the form @xmath76 , @xmath77 the resonance of @xmath78 with the largest imaginary part ; thus @xmath79 , so this is a decaying solution .",
    "the _ only _ reason the assumption @xmath55 is made is due to the possible presence ( to the extent that we do not disprove it here ) of resonances in @xmath80 , apart from the @xmath18-resonance with constants as the resonant state , for larger @xmath5 .",
    "below we give a general result in a form that makes it clear that this is the only remaining item to check  indeed , this even holds in natural vector bundle settings .",
    "having stated the result , we now explain _ why _ it holds . for this purpose",
    "it is best to start with the underlying linear equation ; after all , the non - linearity is ` just ' a rather serious perturbation ! in general , analysis of b - differential operators ( locally finite sums of finite products of elements of @xmath7 ) , such as @xmath81 , has two ingredients , corresponding to the two orders , smoothness and decay , of the sobolev spaces :    1 .",
    "b - regularity analysis .",
    "this provides the framework for understanding pde at high b - frequencies , which in non - degenerate situations involves the b - principal symbol and perhaps a subprincipal term .",
    "this is sufficient in order to control solutions @xmath82 in @xmath83 modulo @xmath84 , @xmath85 , i.e.  modulo a space with higher regularity , but no additional decay . since for the inclusion @xmath86 to be compact one needs both @xmath87 and @xmath88",
    ", this does not control the problem modulo relatively compact errors . 2 .   normal operator analysis .",
    "this provides a framework for understanding the decay properties of solutions of the pde .",
    "the normal operator is obtained by freezing coefficients of the differential operator @xmath89 at @xmath68 to obtain a dilation - invariant b - operator @xmath90 .",
    "one then mellin transforms the normal operator in the normal variable to obtain a family of operators @xmath91 , depending on the mellin - dual variable @xmath92 .",
    "the b - regularity analysis , in non - degenerate situations , gives control of this family @xmath91 in a fredholm sense , uniformly as @xmath93 with @xmath94 bounded .",
    "however , in any such strip , @xmath95 will still typically have finitely many poles @xmath96 ; these poles , called _ resonances _ , dictate the asymptotic behavior of solutions of the pde .    in order to have a fredholm operator @xmath89 , one needs to work in spaces such as @xmath83 , where @xmath97 is such that there are no resonances @xmath96 with @xmath98 .",
    "one can also work in slightly more general spaces , such as @xmath99 , @xmath100 , identified with a space of distributions via @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , corresponding to @xmath101 .",
    "now , the b - regularity analysis for our non - elliptic equation involves the ( null)-bicharacteristic flow . in view of the version of hrmander s theorem on propagation of singularities in this setting , and in view of the a priori control on cauchy data at @xmath24 , what one would like is that all bicharacteristics tend to @xmath102 in one direction .",
    "moreover , for the purposes of the adjoint problem , which effectively imposes cauchy data at @xmath26 , one would like that the bicharacteristics tend to @xmath103 in the other direction .",
    "unfortunately , bicharacteristics within @xmath104 can never leave this space , and thus will not tend to @xmath102 .",
    "this is mostly resolved , however , by the conormal bundle of the _ horizons _ at @xmath25 , which give rise to a bundle of saddle points for the bicharacteristic flow . since the flow is homogeneous , it is convenient to consider it in @xmath105 .",
    "the characteristic set in @xmath106 has two components @xmath107 , with @xmath108 forward - oriented ( i.e.  future oriented time functions increase along null - bicharacteristics in @xmath108 ) , @xmath109 backward oriented",
    ". then the images of the conormal bundles of the horizons in the cosphere bundle are submanifolds @xmath110 of @xmath111 , with one - dimensional stable ( @xmath112)/unstable ( @xmath113 ) manifold @xmath114 transversal to @xmath115 .",
    "( the flow within @xmath27 need not be trivial ; if it is , one has _",
    "radial points _ , as in the @xmath116 de sitter - schwarzschild space .",
    "however , for simplicity we refer to the @xmath27 estimates as _ radial point estimates _ in general . )",
    "the realistic ideal situation , called a _",
    "non - trapping _ one , then is if all ( null-)bicharacteristics in @xmath117 tend to @xmath118 in the backward direction , and @xmath119 in the forward direction , with a similar statement for @xmath108 , with backward and forward interchanged .",
    ", there can not be non - trivial bicharacteristics in @xmath120 tending to @xmath28 in both the forward and the backward direction , since a bicharacteristic is either completely in @xmath111 , or completely outside it .",
    "] in this non - trapping setting the only subtlety is that the propagation estimates through @xmath27 require that the differentiability order @xmath32 and the decay order @xmath97 be related by @xmath121 for a suitable @xmath122 ( dictated by the hamilton dynamics at @xmath27 ) , i.e.  the more decay one wants , the higher the regularity needs to be .",
    "this is still not the case in kerr - de sitter space , though it is true for neighborhoods of the static patch in de sitter space , and its perturbations .",
    "the additional ingredient for kerr - de sitter space is normally hyperbolic trapping , given by smooth submanifolds @xmath123 . here",
    "@xmath124 are invariant submanifolds for the hamilton flow , given by the transversal intersection of locally defined smooth , hamilton flow invariant , @xmath125 , with @xmath126 transversal to @xmath127 , and @xmath128 . combining results of @xcite ( which would work directly in a dilation invariant setting ) and @xcite",
    "we show that for @xmath100 sufficiently small , one can propagate @xmath83 estimates through @xmath124 .",
    "this suffices to complete the b - regularity setup if the non - trapping requirement is replaced by : all ( null-)bicharacteristics in @xmath129 tend to either @xmath130 in the backward direction , and @xmath131 in the forward direction , with the tending to @xmath132 allowed in only _",
    "one _ of the forward and backward directions , with a similar statement for @xmath108 , with backward and forward interchanged . finally , this _ is _ satisfied in kerr - de sitter space , and also in its b - perturbations ( the whole setup is perturbation stable ) .",
    "next , one needs to know about the resonances of the operator . for the wave operator ,",
    "the only resonance with non - negative imaginary part is @xmath18 , with the kernel of @xmath91 one dimensional , consisting of constants .",
    "since strips can only have finitely many resonances , there is @xmath100 such that in @xmath133 the only resonance is @xmath18 ; then @xmath134 works for our fredholm setup . for the klein - gordon equation with @xmath70 small",
    ", the @xmath135 resonance at @xmath18 moves to @xmath136 inside @xmath137 , see @xcite .",
    "thus , one can either work with @xmath138 where @xmath139 is sufficiently small ( depending on @xmath140 ) , or with @xmath134 , though with @xmath141 now identified with @xmath142 .",
    "we now discuss the non - linear terms . here",
    "the basic point is that @xmath143 is an algebra if @xmath144 , and thus for such @xmath32 , products of elements of @xmath83 possess even more decay if @xmath100 , but they become more growing if @xmath145 .",
    "thus , one is forced to work with @xmath146 .",
    "first , with the simplest semilinear equation , with no derivatives in the non - linearity @xmath60 ( so @xmath147 is replaced by @xmath53 ) , the regularity losses due to the normally hyperbolic trapping are in principle sufficiently small to allow for a contraction mapping principle ( picard iteration ) based argument . however",
    ", for the actual wave equation on kerr - de sitter space , the @xmath18-resonance prohibits this , as the iteration maps outside the space @xmath134 .",
    "thus , it is the semilinear klein - gordon equation that is well - behaved from this perspective , and this was solved by the authors in @xcite . on the other hand , if derivatives are allowed , with an at least quadratic behavior in @xmath148 , then the non - linearity annihilates the @xmath18-resonance .",
    "unfortunately , since the normally hyperbolic estimate loses @xmath149 derivatives , as opposed to the usual real principal type / radial point loss of one derivative , the solution operator for @xmath150 will not map @xmath151 back into the desired sobolev space , preventing a non - linear analysis based on the contraction mapping principle .",
    "fortunately , the nash - moser iteration is designed to deal with just such a situation . in this paper",
    "we adapt the iteration to our requirements , and in particular show that semilinear equations of the kind just described are in fact solvable . in particular , we prove that all the estimates used in the linear problems are _",
    "tame_. here we remark that klainerman s early work on global solvability involved the nash - moser scheme @xcite , though this was later removed by klainerman and ponce @xcite . in the present situation",
    "the loss of derivatives seems much more serious , however , due to the trapping , so it seems unlikely that the solution scheme can be made more ` classical ' .    however , we are also interested in quasilinear equations .",
    "quasilinear versions of the above non - trapping scenario were studied by the first author @xcite , who showed the solvability of quasilinear wave equations on perturbations of de sitter space .",
    "the key ingredient in dealing with quasilinear equations is to allow operators with coefficients with regularity the same kind as what one is proving for the solutions , in this case @xmath83-regularity .",
    "all of the smooth linear ingredients ( microlocal elliptic regularity , propagation of singularities , radial points ) have their analogue for @xmath83 coefficients if @xmath32 is sufficiently large .",
    "thus , in @xcite a picard - type iteration , @xmath152 was used to solve the quasilinear wave equations on de sitter space .",
    "notice that @xmath153 has non - smooth coefficients ; indeed , these lie in a weighted b - sobolev space .    in our kerr - de sitter situation",
    "there is normally hyperbolic trapping .",
    "however , notice that as we work in decaying sobolev spaces modulo constants , @xmath154 differs from a kerr - de sitter operator with smooth coefficients , @xmath155 , by one with _",
    "decaying coefficients_. this means that one can combine the smooth coefficient normally hyperbolic theory , as in the work of dyatlov @xcite , with a tame estimate in @xmath83 with @xmath145 ; the sign of @xmath97 here is a crucial gain since for @xmath145 the propagation estimates through normally hyperbolic trapped sets behave in exactly the same way as real principal type estimates . in combination",
    "this provides the required tame estimates for kerr - de sitter wave equations , and nash - moser iteration completes the proof of the main theorem .",
    "we emphasize that our treatment of these quasilinear equations is systematic and general .",
    "thus , quasilinear equations which at @xmath23 are modelled on a finite dimensional family @xmath156 , @xmath157 small corresponding to the zero resonances ( thus the family is @xmath18-dimensional without @xmath18-resonances ! ) , of smooth b - differential operators on a vector bundle with scalar principal symbol which has the bicharacteristic dynamics described above ( radial sets , normally hyperbolic trapping , etc . )",
    "fits into it , _ provided two conditions hold for the normal operator _",
    "( i.e.  the dilation invariant model associated to @xmath89 at @xmath68 ) . of the operator",
    "is irrelevant . ]    1 .",
    "first , _ the resonances for the model @xmath158 _ have negative imaginary part , or if they have @xmath18 imaginary part , the non - linearity annihilates them .",
    "second , the _ normally hyperbolic trapping estimates _ of dyatlov @xcite hold for @xmath91 ( as @xmath159 ) in @xmath160 for some @xmath161 . in the semiclassical rescaling , with @xmath162 , @xmath163 ,",
    "this is a statement about @xmath164 , @xmath165 . by dyatlov s recent result @xcite",
    "this indeed is the case if @xmath166 satisfies that _ at @xmath30 _ its skew - adjoint part , @xmath167 , for @xmath168 has semiclassical principal symbol bounded above by @xmath169 for some @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is the minimal expansion rate in the normal directions at @xmath30 ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1 ) and the remark below it ( which allows the non - trivial skew - adjoint part , denoted by @xmath172 there , microlocally at @xmath30 ) .",
    "it is important to point out that in view of the decay of the solutions either to @xmath18 if there are no real resonance , or to the space of resonant states corresponding to real resonances , the conditions must be checked for at most a finite dimensional family of elements of the ` smooth ' algebra @xmath173 , and moreover there is no need to prove tame estimates , deal with rough coefficients , etc .",
    ", for this point , and one is in a dilation invariant setting , i.e.  can simply mellin transform the problem .",
    "thus , in principle , solving wave - type equations on more complicated bundles is reduced to analyzing these two aspects of the associated linear model operator at infinity .",
    "concretely , we have the following two theorems :    [ thmintrogeneralkg ] let @xmath1 be a kerr - de sitter space with angular momentum @xmath174 that satisfies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 6.13 ) ) , and @xmath5 ensures non - trapping classical dynamics for the null - geodesic flow . ]",

    "the large parameter principal symbol of @xmath180 , with the adjoint taken relative to @xmath181 , at the trapped set @xmath30 is @xmath182 as an endomorphism of @xmath175 , 2 .",
    "@xmath183 has no resonances in @xmath80 .",
    "then for @xmath56 sufficiently small , there exists , in particular , for the value of @xmath184 . ] @xmath185 such that the following holds : if @xmath73 has a sufficiently small @xmath186-norm , then the equation @xmath187 has a unique smooth global forward solution @xmath75 .",
