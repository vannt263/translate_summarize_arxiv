    "discrete topological structures arise abundantly in physical systems modeling .",
    "a classical approach to the analysis of electrical circuits , dating back to kirchhoff , is based on the circuit graph .",
    "similar approaches apply to many other cases , including e.g. mass - spring - damper mechanical systems , multi - body systems , hydraulic networks , chemical reaction networks , and power systems .",
    "common feature is that the discrete structures , in particular graphs , are blended with dynamical relations , leading to various sorts of _ network dynamics_.    during the last two decades network dynamics has received ever - increasing attention , with inputs , among others , from graph theory , multi - agent systems , dynamical systems , and statistical mechanics . in this paper",
    "we formulate a general _ geometric framework for defining physical dynamics on directed open graphs_. the generalized hamiltonian nature of the resulting dynamical models is due to the assumption that the constitutive relations between the variables corresponding to storage at the vertices and/or edges are derivable from an _ energy _ ( hamiltonian ) function , while the remaining variables are related by static _ energy - dissipating _ relations .",
    "this will imply that the total energy itself satisfies a conservation law : the increase of the total energy is equal to externally supplied power ( through the boundary vertices of the graph ) , minus the power lost in the dissipative elements ( associated to some of the edges or vertices of the graph ) .",
    "the resulting generalized hamiltonian systems , allowing for energy - dissipation and interaction with the environment , fall within the class of _ port - hamiltonian systems _ , as coined and explored in e.g. @xcite .    from a geometric point of view the generalized hamiltonian structure of the network dynamics is defined , apart from its hamiltonian function and energy - dissipating relations , by a _",
    "dirac structure_. this dirac structure ( generalizing the symplectic or poisson structure from classical mechanics ) is directly defined by the _ incidence _ matrix of the directed graph , and thus captures the conservation laws .",
    "in fact , we will show how a directed graph gives rise to three canonically defined dirac structures on its vertex and edge spaces .",
    "the first two of them only differ in the different role of the boundary vertices , while the third , the kirchhoff - dirac structure , captures the special case where no storage or dissipation is associated with the vertices of the graph ( corresponding to kirchhoff s current laws ) .",
    "we will illustrate this framework on some of the physical examples mentioned above .",
    "furthermore , we will show how the same port - hamiltonian structure is shared by network dynamics from a different origin , such as consensus and clustering algorithms , and how the identification of the underlying port - hamiltonian structure provides powerful tools for analysis and control , which unify and go beyond existing approaches .",
    "while all examples given in the paper are simple , and could be approached from other angles as well , we believe that a major contribution of the paper resides in the identification of a common mathematical structure in all these examples , which is moreover closely related to classical hamiltonian systems . furthermore , the approach formalizes network dynamics as",
    "_ open _ system , and due to the compositionality properties of port - hamiltonian systems , is easily scalable and extends to heterogeneous and multi - scale systems as well .    in a twin paper",
    "we will describe how the geometric framework as developed in this paper for graphs can be extended to arbitrary @xmath0-complexes . among others ,",
    "this will allow for a structure - preserving spatial discretization of distributed - parameter physical systems , otherwise described by partial differential equations ; see already @xcite .",
    "preliminary work regarding sections 3.4 and 3.5 can be found in @xcite .",
    "as a guiding example let us consider a _",
    "mass - spring - damper _ system ; for example the one depicted in figure [ figure : example - network ] .",
    "the underlying directed graph of such a system is defined by _",
    "vertices _ corresponding to the masses , and _ edges _ corresponding to the springs and dampers ; leading to the graph in figure [ figure : example - graph ] .",
    "how do we formalize such a system as a port - hamiltonian system ?",
    "key ingredient in the definition of a port - hamiltonian system is the geometric notion of a _ dirac structure _ , generalizing the symplectic structure from classical hamiltonian dynamics . in this section",
    "we will define two canonical dirac structures on the combination of the vertex , edge and boundary spaces of a directed graph , and their dual spaces .",
    "these two dirac structures will only differ in the role of the boundary vertices , which for a mass - spring - damper system will be either associated to boundary masses ( with inputs being the external forces on them ) , or will be _ massless _ ( with inputs being their velocities ) .",
    "we first recall some basic notions of graph theory , see e.g. @xcite , and dirac structures , see e.g. @xcite .      a _ directed graph _ @xmath1 consists of a finite set @xmath2 of _ vertices _ ( nodes ) and a finite set @xmath3 of directed _ edges _ ( branches or links ) , together with a mapping from @xmath3 to the set of ordered pairs of @xmath2 , where no self - loops are allowed .",
    "thus to any branch @xmath4 there corresponds an ordered pair @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 ) , representing the tail vertex @xmath7 and the head vertex @xmath8 of this edge .    a directed graph is completely specified by its _ incidence matrix _",

    "one , somewhat dual to the kirchhoff - dirac structure , is to constrain ( some of ) the _ edge efforts _ in the flow / effort - continuous graph dirac structure to zero .",
    "another interesting option is to constrain some of the _ edge flows _ in the flow / effort - continuous graph dirac structure to zero .",
    "considering the description of the flow / effort - continuous graph dirac structure this effectively reduces ( by disregarding the associated edge efforts ) to the flow / effort - continuous graph dirac structure of the reduced graph where the edges corresponding to the zero edge flows have been left out .",
    "alternatively , one may constrain some of the _ internal vertex efforts _ to zero . again considering the description of the flow / effort - continuous graph dirac structure",
    "this amounts to _ deleting _ the corresponding internal vertices , turning them into boundary vertices with prescribed zero efforts .",
    "note that this yields a setting for dealing with",
    "_ dynamic graphs_.",
    "first ( section 3.1 ) we will describe how port - hamiltonian systems can be defined with respect to the canonical graph dirac structures defined above . in the subsequent subsections this",
    "will be illustrated on a number of typical examples , ranging from mass - spring - damper systems and spatial mechanisms to consensus and clustering algorithms .      in this subsection",
    "we will apply the general definition of port - hamiltonian systems with regard to an arbitrary dirac structure , see e.g. @xcite , to the graph dirac structures as defined above .    for clarity of exposition",
    "we throughout consider the _ effort - continuous _ graph dirac structure @xmath140 involving the flow and effort variables @xmath155 ( the exposition is directly repeated for the flow - continuous graph dirac structure @xmath138 ) .",
    "a port - hamiltonian system is specified by defining between all the _ internal _ conjugate flow and effort variables @xmath156 either an _ energy - storing _ relation , or a purely _ dissipative _ relation . an energy - storing relation between a vector of flow variables @xmath157 and a conjugate vector of effort variables",
    "@xmath158 is of the form will denote the _ column _ vector of partial derivatives of @xmath159 , with @xmath160 denoting the _ row _ vector of partial derivatives . ]",
    "@xmath161 or dually @xmath162 where @xmath163 is a vector of energy variables ( of the same dimension as @xmath157 and @xmath158 ) , and @xmath164 is any function , representing the energy stored in the system .",
    "furthermore , a dissipative relation between a vector of flow variables @xmath157 and a conjugate vector of effort variables @xmath158 is any static relation @xmath165 satisfying @xmath166 for all @xmath167 satisfying @xmath168 .    in the case of a mass - spring - damper system with boundary masses ( see section [ sub : mass - spring - systems ] ) the vertex flow and effort variables @xmath169 will be related by energy - storing relations @xmath170 , with @xmath171 the momenta of the masses and @xmath172 their kinetic energies , the flow and effort variables @xmath173 of the spring edges will correspond to energy - storing relations @xmath174 , with @xmath175 the spring elongations and @xmath176 the spring potential energies , while finally the flow and effort variables @xmath177 of the damper edges are connected by energy - dissipating relations @xmath178 satisfying @xmath179 .",
    "thus a port - hamiltonian system on a graph is defined by adding to the linear relations imposed by the graph dirac structure _ constitutive _ relations between all the internal effort and flow variables , either of energy - storing or of dissipative type .",
    "it is clear that this leaves many possibilities for defining port - hamiltonian dynamics . in particular , energy - storage , respectively dissipation , can be associated to the vertices or to the edges , or to both .",
    "the examples presented in the next subsections cover a number of these different possibilities .",
    "the interpretation of the flow / effort - continuous graph dirac structure as describing _",
    "discrete conservation or balance laws _ becomes more clear from the above description of port - hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "for example , consider for the effort - continuous graph dirac structure the case of energy storage associated to all the edges and vertices : @xmath180 \\dot{x}_0 & = & -f_0 , \\quad & e^0 & = & \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x_0}(x^1 , x_0 ) \\end{array}\\ ] ] for state variables @xmath181 and @xmath182 , and energy function @xmath159 .",
    "then the relations imposed by the effort - continuous graph dirac structure imply @xmath183 expressing discrete conservation ( or balance ) laws between the storage of the quantities @xmath184 associated to the vertices and the flow @xmath133 through the edges , respectively between the storage of the quantities @xmath185 associated to the edges and the effort @xmath135 at the vertices .",
    "the mass - spring system discussed in the next subsection will be of this type .",
    "furthermore , it is well - known @xcite that port - hamiltonian systems may easily entail _ algebraic constraints _ on their state variables . indeed ,",
    "whenever some of the effort variables @xmath186 or @xmath187 are constrained by the dirac structure , then this will generally ( depending on the hamiltonian @xmath159 ) lead to algebraic constraints on the state variables @xmath163 .",
    "finally , we note a fundamental property of any port - hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "let @xmath164 denote the total energy of the port - hamiltonian system . then",
    "because of the power - conserving property of the dirac structure , and denoting the flows and efforts of the dissipative elements by @xmath188 , @xmath189 hence the total energy itself satisfies a conservation law : its increase is equal to the externally supplied power @xmath190 minus the dissipated power @xmath191 .",
    "one may directly extend the definition of port - hamiltonian systems on graphs to the case where the graphs are dynamically changing in time ; as briefly indicated in section [ sub : derived ] .",
    "this leads to _ switching port - hamiltonian systems on graphs _ ; see already @xcite .",
    "the basic way of modeling a _ mass - spring - damper system _ as a port - hamiltonian system on a graph @xmath54 is to associate the _ masses _ to the _ vertices _ , and the _ springs _ and _ dampers _ to the _ edges _ of the graph , cf .",

    "we will start with the separate treatment of mass - spring ( section [ sub : massspring ] ) and mass - damper ( section [ sub : massdamper ] ) systems , before their merging in section [ sub : massspringdamper ] .",

    "first consider the situation that the mass - spring system is located in one - dimensional space @xmath192 , and the springs are scalar .",
    "a vector in the vertex space @xmath19 then corresponds to the vector @xmath171 of the scalar momenta of all @xmath11 masses , i.e. , @xmath193 .",
    "furthermore , a vector in the dual edge space @xmath28 will correspond to the total vector @xmath175 of elongations of all @xmath12 springs , i.e. , @xmath194 .",
    "next ingredient is the definition of the hamiltonian ( stored energy ) @xmath195 ( which normally splits into a sum of the kinetic and potential energies of each mass and spring ) . in the absence of boundary vertices the dynamics of the mass - spring system is then described as the port - hamiltonian system @xmath196 defined with respect to the graph dirac structure @xmath197 .",
    "note that in fact the skew - symmetric matrix @xmath198 defines a _ poisson structure _ on the state space @xmath199 .",
    "the inclusion of boundary vertices , and thereby of external interaction , can be done in different ways .",
    "the first option is to associate _ boundary masses _ to the boundary vertices .",

    "@xmath71 are the external _ forces _ exerted ( by the environment ) on the boundary masses , and @xmath202 are the _ velocities _ of these boundary masses .",
    "another possibility is to start from the flow - continuous graph dirac structure @xmath138 . in this case",

    "note that in this latter case the external velocities @xmath204 of the boundary vertices can be considered to be _ inputs _ to the system and the forces @xmath205 to be _ outputs _ ; in contrast to the previously considered case ( boundary vertices corresponding to boundary masses ) , where the forces @xmath205 are inputs and the velocities @xmath204 the outputs of the system .",
    "the above formulation of mass - spring systems in @xmath192 directly extends to @xmath206 by using the incidence operator @xmath207 as defined before .",
