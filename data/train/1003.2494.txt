    "the space of hyperbolic cone 3-manifolds with fixed topological type and with cone angles less than @xmath0 is well understood by @xcite , but the boundary of this space is not .",
    "the aim of this paper is to establish a regeneration result in the spirit of hodgson @xcite , that goes from a hyperbolic 2-orbifold , viewed as a collapsed 3-orbifold , to a family of hyperbolic cone 3-manifolds with decreasing cone angles , starting at @xmath0 .",
    "the 3-orbifold is seifert fibered , and those cone manifolds appear in the proof of the orbifold theorem ; however , none of the approaches shows the explicit collapse , as the seifert fibration is constructed by other methods @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 be a closed and orientable 3-orbifold , which is seifert fibered over a two orbifold @xmath2 : @xmath3 the branching locus of @xmath1 is a link or a trivalent graph @xmath4 .",
    "its edges and circles are grouped in two , horizontal ( if they are transverse to the fibers ) or vertical ( if they are fibers ) : @xmath5 points in @xmath6 project to the mirror and dihedral points of @xmath2 .",
    "assume that the orbifold @xmath2 is a _",
    "coxeter group , generated by reflections on a hyperbolic polygon whose angles are @xmath0 over an integer .",
    "thus @xmath2 is a polygon with mirror points at the edges , and dihedral points at the vertices .",
    "we may assume also that @xmath2 has possibly a single cone point in its interior .",
    "for instance , @xmath7 with branching locus a montesinos link is an example of such fibration .",
    "we view the seifert fibration as a transversely hyperbolic foliation , hence with a developing map @xmath8 that factors through the universal covering of @xmath9 .    according to kerckhoff s proof of nielsen conjecture @xcite",
    ", there is a unique point in the teichmller space that minimizes the perimeter of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the orbifold equiped with this hyperbolic structure .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following :    [ theorem:1 ] assume that @xmath2 has at most one cone point in its interior .",
    "there exists a family of hyperbolic cone manifold structures @xmath11 on @xmath12 , with singular locus @xmath13 and cone angle @xmath14 on @xmath6 and constant angles ( the orbifold ones ) on @xmath15 , so that @xmath16 for the gromov - hausdorff convergence . moreover the developing maps converge to the developing map of the transversely hyperbolic foliation",
    ".    the orbifold @xmath1 can be viewed as a cone manifold @xmath17 with geometry @xmath18 or @xmath19 , depending on the euler number . with one of these geometries , the singular edges and circles are either horizontal ( with angle @xmath0 ) or vertical , as those geometries are fibered .",
    "the theorem generalizes to those cone manifolds , without assuming that the vertical angles are @xmath20 , just that the basis is a polygon with angles @xmath21 .",
    "this means that if @xmath22 is the order of a singular fiber ( with @xmath23 if the fiber is regular ) , and if @xmath24 is the cone angle , then we require @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath26 be the number of circles and edges on @xmath27 .",
    "choose weights @xmath28 on these horizontal components .",
    "those induce weights @xmath29 on the edges of @xmath2 , just by adding the two weights of the mirror points of the fiber of any interior point of the edge , ie .  @xmath30 .",
    "of course if @xmath31 , then @xmath32 is the constant weight . if @xmath33 are the edges of @xmath2 , with lengths @xmath34 , the @xmath32-perimeter is defined as @xmath35 we will show ( proposition  [ prop : geometry ] ) that in the set of hyperbolic structures on a polygon with ordered angles @xmath36 there is a unique minimizer of the @xmath32-perimeter , that we denote @xmath37    [ theorem:2 ] let @xmath17 be a closed , orientable cone manifold with geometry @xmath18 or @xmath19 with cone angles @xmath38 , and with space of fibers a polygon @xmath2 with angles @xmath21 .",

    "a version of theorem  [ theorem:1 ] was stated in hodgson s thesis @xcite .",

    "the idea of regenerating from kerckhoff minimizers is also related to a theorem of series on pleated surfaces @xcite , where as an application she also obtains a family of cone manifolds .",
    "theorem  [ theorem:1 ] needs to assume that there is at most one cone point in the interior of the polygon , otherwise @xmath45 would contain an essential torus , contradicting the existence of hyperbolic cone structures .      with branching locus this link .",

    "concerning the equivariance , the structure of @xmath2 that minimizes the perimeter is unique , by kerckhoff @xcite , hence equivariant . the structure of the hyperbolic cone manifolds is also equivariant because it is unique , by weiss global rigidity @xcite .",
    "notice that two or more cone points would not produce a polygon when unfolding , but an orbifold with more complicated underlying space .",
    "let us show a consequence of theorem  [ theorem:2 ] for hyperbolic polyhedra .",

    "[ prop : prism ] when @xmath62 , the prism converges to the @xmath46-edged polygon with angles @xmath61 of minimal @xmath32-perimeter , where @xmath65 .",
    "the following result follows from the proof of theorem  [ theorem:2 ] and the results of appendix  [ sec : appendix ] . given @xmath66 with @xmath67 ,",
    "let @xmath68 denote the space of hyperbolic n - gons with those ordered angles .",
    "[ prop : geometry ] the perimeter has a unique minimum in @xmath69 .",
    "in addition , this is the only polygon in @xmath69 that has an inscribed circle tangent to all of its edges .    for @xmath70 , with @xmath71 ,",
    "the @xmath72-perimeter has a unique minimum in @xmath69 .",
    "in addition , this is the only polygon in @xmath69 such that has a point @xmath73 in its interior , so that @xmath74 is independent of the edges @xmath75 of the polygon .    to prove proposition  [ prop : geometry ] , in appendix  [ sec : appendix ] we adapt to this setting the remarkable work of kerckhoff @xcite , thurston @xcite and wolpert @xcite on earthquakes and convexity of length functions , and a generalization of thurston s earthquake theorem to cone manifolds due to bonsante and schlenker @xcite . in addition , in the proof of theorem  [ theorem:1 ] there is killing vector field ( corresponding to the deformation of the fiber ) that has an axis perpendicular to the polygon and is equidistant to all of its edges .",
    "in particular the polygon that minimizes the perimeter has an inscribed circle tangent to all of its edges .",
    "uniqueness of the polygon in @xmath69 with such an inscribed circle is easy to prove by a continuity method , however i was unable to find proposition  [ prop : geometry ] in the literature .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ theorem:1 ] has two parts : first to construct a curve of representations of the smooth part of @xmath1 and second to prove that these representations are holonomy structures of the cone manifolds by constructing developing maps .    for the construction of the curve",
    ", we have to choose the structure that minimizes the perimeter . using the symplectic structure of the variety of representations of @xmath76 , due to goldman @xcite",
    ", the hamiltonian vector field of the perimeter is essentially the direction to regenerate in the variety of representations of @xmath76 .",
    "beeing a critical point for the perimeter implies that this direction is induced from deformations of @xmath77 .",
    "the construction of the curve of representation is much easier if the base @xmath2 is a triangle , ie .",
    "the orbifold is small . in this case",
    "the teichmller space is just a point , and a direct computation in cohomology allows to construct the curve of representations .",
    "notice also that , since the orbifold is small , the analysis of paiva - barreto @xcite applies here , to prove that the limit of cone manifolds is the 2-dimensional orbifold .",
    "once we have the existence of the curve of representations , we construct developing maps . for this",
    "we use the fibration : vertices of the base correspond to rational tangles , edges to @xmath78-fibered strips , and the interior points to regular fibers .",
    "we construct the developing map first for the tangles , then for the strips that connect them , and finally for the regular points .",
    "in particular the union of tangles and neighborhoods of the strips is a solid torus , and the underlying space of the orbifold is a generalized lens space .",
    "previous to this construction , we must analyze the infinitesimal deformation of the fiber , and the corresponding killing vector field , which happens to be perpendicular to the developing map of the two dimensional polygon .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ theorem:2 ] follows exactly the same scheme as theorem  [ theorem:1 ] , just by adding the weights , and by adapting some arguments from orbifolds to cone manifolds . to simplify ,",
    "we discuss first theorem  [ theorem:1 ] and prove theorem  [ theorem:2 ] in section  [ section : weights ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : varieties of representations ] we state the existence of a one parameter deformation of representations with some properties .",

    "we start with the holonomy representation of the hyperbolic orbifold @xmath80 where the elements preserve or reverse the orientation of @xmath81 according to the sign of the determinant .",

    "when @xmath1092 , existence and uniqueness is corollary  [ cor : minimizer ] .",
    "the fact that it has an inscribed circle tangent to all of its faces ( when there are no weights ) follows from the properties of the killing vector field in proposition  [ lemma : killingfield ] . when there are weights @xmath32 , this assertion is consequence of the formulas in the proof of proposition  [ lemma : killingfield ] .",
    "we discuss the case when some of the angles @xmath804 become @xmath1093 .",
    "assume first that at least two of the cone angles become @xmath437 .",
    "then the cone manifold @xmath994 obtained as a double of the polygon has at least two cone angles equal to @xmath0 .",
    "consider a two to one ramified covering of @xmath994 , with ramification locus precisely the cone points of angle @xmath0 . in this way",
    "we obtain a cone manifold with cone angles @xmath996 , and we may apply the previous argument , also with arcs and some closed geodesics , instead of only arcs .",
    "assume now there is only one cone angle equal to @xmath437 and all other cone angles are @xmath993 .",
    "then the cone manifold obtained as double of the polygon has one cone angle @xmath0 and all other cone angles @xmath1026 .",
    "the teichmller space of the polygon is embedded in @xmath1094 , with coordinates the length of the edges . using the ambient metric of @xmath1094 , a unit tangent vector @xmath394 to this teichmller space",
    "has at least one coordinate larger than @xmath1095 ( up to replacing @xmath394 by @xmath1096 ) .",
    "we can assume that it happens to be the first coordinate .",
    "now , deform the angle @xmath437 to @xmath1097 , and call @xmath1098 the minimum , that varies continuously .",
    "deform also the tangent vector @xmath1099 so that the first coordinate is at least @xmath1100 .",
    "view @xmath1099 as a tangent vector @xmath1101 to the teichmller space of @xmath994 , the cone manifold double of the polygon .",
    "let @xmath1102 be the earthquake path tangent to @xmath1101 .",
    "by lemma  [ lemma : wolpertlamination ] ( 1 ) , the intersection of @xmath1014 with the first edge is @xmath1103 .",
    "thus @xmath1104 and , by lemma  [ lemma : wolpertlamination ] ( 2 ) , the second derivative of @xmath1007 in the direction of @xmath394 is @xmath1105 , for some @xmath1013 that we claim that exists and is uniform because the cone manifold @xmath994 has only one cone angle equal to @xmath0 .",
    "once we have this claim , there is a positive lower bound to the second derivative of the perimeter , that it is uniform on @xmath625 , hence it holds for @xmath1106 and shows that the hessian of the perimeter is positive definite .",
    "let us prove the existence of this @xmath1013 uniform in @xmath625 , when precisely one of the cone angles is @xmath1107 and the other ones are @xmath1026 .",
    "the distance between a cone point of angle @xmath995 and a closed geodesic is @xmath1027 .",
    "thus , if @xmath763 is a segment between two cone points , since at least one of them has angle @xmath1026 , then the angle between any closed geodesic and @xmath763 is bounded below in terms of @xmath1108 and an upper bound to the length @xmath1007 , hence the angles @xmath1024 and @xmath1025 that occur in lemma  [ lemma : wolpertscc](2 ) are bounded below away from zero , independently of @xmath1109 .",
    "this gives the desired bound .",
    "the arguments in the proof of corollary  [ cor : geometry ] also give :    [ remark : pi ] corollary  [ cor : minimizer ] also holds true when some angles of @xmath2 are @xmath437 .",
    "the lie algebra of infinitesimal isometries is denoted by @xmath119 .",
    "it is naturally equipped with the complex killing form @xmath1110 defined by @xmath1111 .",
    "thus , @xmath1112 let @xmath1113 be an infinitesimal isometry of complex length @xmath187 ( ie .",

    "then @xmath1115 in particular @xmath1116 iff @xmath1113 is trivial or parabolic .    the killing vector field @xmath280 corresponding to @xmath1117 is the field tangent to the orbits of @xmath1118 , the one parameter group of diffeomorphism of @xmath433 .",
    "we notice that for @xmath1119 , @xmath1120 is the translational part of @xmath1121 at @xmath798 .",
    "when @xmath1121 is not parabolic , then @xmath1118 has an invariant axis , that it is also the minimizing locus for the norm @xmath752 .",
    "this axis is denoted by @xmath1122 .",
    "the killing vector field has nonempty vanishing locus iff @xmath1121 is an infinitesimal rotation , then it vanishes precisely at @xmath1122 .          notice that @xmath1127 .",
    "thus since traceless matrices in @xmath87 are @xmath0-rotations in @xmath433 , @xmath1128 is a rotation of angle @xmath0 around @xmath1122 .",
    "hence , the product @xmath1129 is an isometry of complex length @xmath1130 .",
    "thus @xmath1131 the proposition follows from this formula and @xmath1132      [ remark : killing ] in the previous proposition , if @xmath1133 are infinitesimal rotations of respective angles @xmath1134 and @xmath1135 , and if we have @xmath1136 , then it makes sense to talk about orientation of their axis . in this case",
    "we have : @xmath1137    this remark follows immediately from proposition  [ prop : killing ] and a continuity argument , by deforming first @xmath1135 to @xmath1134 and then by moving one of the oriented edges to the other , because @xmath1138 .",
    "up to conjugacy , we may assume that @xmath1147 in the upper half space model .",

    "thus : @xmath1154 on the other hand , @xmath1155= [ x : -x+t\\,a : x+t\\ , a : -x]= \\frac{t^2 a^2}{4x^2},\\ ] ] and the formula follows .      [ rem : equidistant ] assume @xmath698 satisfy @xmath1156 , @xmath1113 is parabolic , and @xmath1141 is not .",
    "the horosphere centered at @xmath1157 and tangent to the axis @xmath1144 has a natural complex structure , up to homothety .",
    "fix a complex structure in which @xmath1158 is the unit tangent vector to @xmath1144 , and suppose that @xmath1159 is the translation vector of @xmath1160 in this horosphere .",
