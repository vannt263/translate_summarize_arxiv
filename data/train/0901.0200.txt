    "high - throughput _ ab initio _ methods , capable of predicting properties of an ample set of materials from quantum mechanics calculations , are becoming important tools for scientists working in rational materials development .",
    "these methods allow researchers to correlate between different systems and to observe trends converging toward the predictions of new materials @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the `` several - calculations '' and the `` high - throughput '' philosophies is that the latter requires rapid estimations of materials properties so that the correlations between systems , even if roughly characterized , become the target information instead of the throughout and accurate description of a small subset . clearly , to analyze the extensive amount of information and to extract correlations , ad - hoc algorithms and appropriate computer softwares have to be developed .",
    "furthermore , once the space of the search is narrowed , a detailed study can be employed on the obtained reduced set of feasible candidate systems .",
    "several examples have appeared in literature in recent years , for instance the `` data - mining of quantum calculations '' method leading to the principle component analysis of the formation energies of many alloys in several configurations @xcite , the evolutionary approach for determining hamiltonian @xcite , the `` pareto - optimal '' alloys and catalysts @xcite the prediction of the lithium - boron superconductor @xcite , the `` high - throughput kohn - anomalies '' search in ternary lithium - borides @xcite , and the `` multi - optimization '' techniques used in studying high - temperature reactions in multicomponent hydrides @xcite .",
    "this manuscript focuses on the high - throughput formalism for the calculations of solubility in binary alloys ( solvus lines ) .",
    "the knowledge of solubility is crucial for designing new alloys with particular physical , chemical , and mechanical properties .",
    "for example , if we have to enhance an alloy property by adding extra specie as solute , it is necessary to know the equilibrium solubility to understand if it is possible to dissolve the candidate specie , and , if possible , to avoid supersaturation - precipitation and subsequent modification of the target property ( aging effect ) . in superconducting materials research ,",
    "the problem emerges frequently : often expensive and difficult experiments are undertaken to enhance the critical temperature @xcite . even in catalysis research , recent experiments and modeling",
    "have shown that the solubility of carbon is responsible of thermodynamic instabilities hindering the catalytic activity of very small fe and fe : mo clusters @xcite .",
    "the calculation of solubility of zr in al has already been addressed with success within the regular solution model @xcite fit to _ ab initio _ calculations @xcite .",
    "solubility can also be extracted from the knowledge of the phase diagram which , in the case of lattice - conserving alloys , can be generated within the the cluster expansion @xcite and monte carlo approaches@xcite .",
    "however , a straightforward formalism leading to the estimation of equilibrium solubility for general alloys is still lacking .    in the present paper we devised a statistical - thermodynamic approach for the calculation of atomic solubility in alloys .",
    "the advantage of our approach consists in taking into account all available ground states rather than just the pure species configurations . to test the method , we present calculations for a number of binary titanium systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    ", the experimental equilibrium solubility tends usually to be overestimated .",
    "in fact , the formation of metastable and/or unstable states which are subsequently frozen at low temperatures , can make solubility measurements very challenging . in such scenarios ,",
    "the measured solubility may correspond to spinodal concentration rather then actual binodal concentration or simply characterize the frozen out of equilibrium solubility remaining from the initial specimen preparation at higher temperature .",
    "besides , the segregation of defects into grain - boundaries , especially in multicrystalline samples prepared through non optimal cooling dramatically affect the amount of frozen defects and solutes .",
    "based on the statistical - thermodynamic theory of dilute lattice gas , we developed an approach to calculate the atomic bulk solubility in alloys .",
    "the advantage of our approach consists in considering all the appropriate ground states rather than the pure species .",
    "it was shown that the low - solubility follows simple arrhenius - type temperature dependence determined by a _",
    "`` low - solubility formation enthalpy''_. this quantity is defined as the composition derivative of the compound formation enthalpy with respect to nearby ground states .",
    "`` low - solubility formation enthalpy '' coincides with the usual defect formation enthalpy only in the case of a phase - separating alloy having no intermediate ground states and vacancies .",
    "the key quantities of our model can be directly obtained by first - principles calculations of by fitting experimental temperature solubility dependence .",
    "generalization of our model to intermediate phases and/or to multicomponent , multisublattice , interstitial - substitutional alloys is straightforward .    as examples",
    ", we applied the framework for a set ot eight ti alloys a - ti ( a = ag , au , cd , co , cr , ir , w , zn ) .",
    "we have found that the highest solubility for zn , cd , ag , and au is in qualitative agreement with available experimental data and band structure expectations .",
    "the quantitative differences between the theory and experiment observed in the present and other similar studies are discussed .    in conclusion ,",
    "our formalism is correct in the limit of low - solubility and should be considered as an appropriate starting point for determining if more computationally expensive formalisms are otherwise needed .",
