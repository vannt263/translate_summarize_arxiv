    "circumstellar accretion disks are an integral part of the star and planet formation process .",

    "* ) . the structural , material , and chemical compositions of disks provide crucial insights on the initial conditions of the planet formation process",
    ". while molecular gas is the dominant mass species in these disks , observations of this phase are notoriously difficult due to the radiative inefficiency of h@xmath7 , the depletion of molecules from the gas phase onto dust grain surfaces , and the relative insensitivity of many current telescopes .",
    "consequently , much of our knowledge of disk properties is gathered from the comparatively bright thermal continuum emission of dust particles heated by irradiation from the central star ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    at any given frequency",
    ", this continuum emission is generated from dust grains at a relatively small range of contributing stellocentric radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the detailed morphology of its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is dictated by the physical structure and material content of the disk ( e.g. , temperatures , densities , geometry , and particle properties ) .",
    "much of the infrared sed is generated in the optically thick inner few au of the disk , corresponding roughly to the region in the solar system occupied by the terrestrial planets .",
    "because optical depths are so high at these radii , the infrared sed can be used to infer disk temperatures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the far - infrared and millimeter / radio portion of the sed ( hereafter referred to as  submillimeter \" for convenience ) originates primarily in the optically thin outer disk , from several to perhaps hundreds of au .",
    "the low column densities in this region lead to a direct relationship between the submillimeter luminosity and the disk mass @xcite .",
    "moreover , the shape of the long - wavelength sed is at least partially controlled by the disk opacity @xcite .",
    "the optical properties of the dust grain population , especially the particle size distribution , are encoded in this latter parameter @xcite .    in practice",
    ", one can infer the circumstellar dust mass around a young star with a submillimeter flux density and constrain the bulk optical characteristics of the solid particle population using submillimeter colors .",
    "constraints on these properties are empirical prerequisites for understanding the mechanisms and timescales involved in the planet formation process .",
    "the progenitor disk mass not only sets a limit on the material composition and structure of a potential planetary system , but can also elucidate whether any particular mechanism of planet formation is more plausible than another .",
    "as an example , models that rely on gravitational instabilities in the disk to drive rapid giant planet formation are only tenable if the disk is sufficiently massive @xcite . moreover ,",
    "interpreting submillimeter colors in terms of the current solid particle size distribution in these disks may reveal clues on the efficiency of the grain growth process , representing the first tentative steps of building planetesimals .",
    "@xcite presented the first large survey of the 1.3 mm emission from young stellar objects ( ysos ; defined here as a young star and its circumstellar environment ) in the taurus - auriga star formation region . following up with a supplementary survey @xcite and smaller , multiwavelength submillimeter samples @xcite , these studies provided the first detailed look at the circumstellar disk mass distribution and the shape of the opacity spectrum .",
    "the results argued for a typical disk mass similar to that required to form the solar system and an opacity spectrum shallower than noted in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , possibly due to grain growth . around the same time",

    "one major impact of their work was highlighting that the millimeter luminosities appeared tied to the same yso evolution sequence typically tracked in the infrared : younger sources on this empirical sequence were shown to have larger circumstellar dust masses .    to build on these landmark studies",

    "this work had the benefits of at least a factor of 5 better sensitivity and a considerably more uniform luminosity limit than previous observations .",
    "in addition to a more complete census of disk masses and their evolution , this survey permitted us to derive the distribution of submillimeter colors between 350@xmath6 m and 1.3 mm , and show that these also changed as a function of yso evolutionary state .",
    "in this article , we present a similar study of the submillimeter continuum emission from circumstellar dust in the @xmath0 oph region . in  2 we describe the new survey data , its acquisition and reduction , and the compilation of an extended sample similar to the one used for taurus .",
    "disk masses and colors are computed in  3 , and the results for @xmath0 oph ysos are systematically compared with their counterparts in taurus .",

    "* ) . in the ism ,",
    "the generally small ( sub - micron ) dust particles are relatively inefficient submillimeter emitters with @xmath48 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , resulting in steep submillimeter spectra with @xmath49 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , in the high - density environment of a circumstellar disk , solid particles are expected to grow to substantially larger sizes via collisional agglomeration ( see the recent review by * ? ? ?",
    "for a given grain composition and morphology , increased particle sizes due to such growth will decrease the value of @xmath50 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this in turn would be manifested as a shallow submillimeter continuum spectrum , or decreased @xmath45 .",
    "to assess the potential signatures of grain growth in @xmath0 oph disks , we have calculated submillimeter colors ( @xmath45 ) between 350@xmath6 m and 1.3 mm whenever multiwavelength data were available . in cases with @xmath512 flux density measurements in this wavelength range , @xmath45 was determined by a linear fit in the @xmath52 plane . otherwise , a simple flux ratio was utilized to measure a color or upper limit .",

    "based on the above discussion , it would be tempting to conclude that the submillimeter seds for the @xmath0 oph sample show clear evidence for significant solid particle growth ( with @xmath55 ) . however , there are a number of other effects that can serve to mimic the signatures of a shallow opacity spectrum .",
    "perhaps the most relevant of these is optically thick contamination , originating in the dense inner disk . as a tracer of the disk temperature ,",
    "emission with large optical depths will bias @xmath45 to lower values because it has the same spectral shape as the planck function in the rayleigh - jeans limit ( @xmath56 ) .",

    "* ) implies that the rayleigh - jeans limit may not be valid ( i.e. , if much of the emission comes from dust with @xmath58k ) . in this case , the thermal emission is considerably shallower than @xmath59 and may contribute to the observed low @xmath45 values .",
    "finally , there are more technical considerations , particularly the rather large uncertainties on @xmath45 due to calibration inaccuracies and small frequency leverage , as well as contamination from non - disk emission ( see paper i for details ) .    despite these uncertainties",
    ", it would be difficult to account for the submillimeter color distribution in figure [ n_cdf ] for an opacity spectrum similar to that in the ism ( see * ? ? ?",
    "detailed disk structure modeling and spatially resolved data are required to reach a more definitive conclusion . in those cases where",
    "the disk structure has been resolved and can be used to correct the colors ( @xmath45 ) for optically thick contamination , the typical opacity index is @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "without resolved data , the colors presented here serve solely as empirical properties of ysos . while the opacity spectra of these sources remain uncertain , the observed colors are certainly significantly different than noted for dust in the ism , in the same sense as expected for when particle sizes are increased .",
    "the issue of grain growth will be addressed further in  4.3 .",
    "having established the basic submillimeter properties of ysos in @xmath0 oph , we can make a comparison with their counterparts in taurus from paper i. taurus is a substantially less crowded region , with projected stellar densities reaching only @xmath850@xmath1160 stars pc@xmath61 @xcite compared with the @xmath8200 stars pc@xmath61 noted in the @xmath0 oph core @xcite . despite the higher concentration of ysos in @xmath0 oph , a simple calculation of the collision timescale shows that dynamical interactions are not expected to significantly affect their disk properties . de - projecting the @xcite stellar density into a 1pc@xmath62 volume ( @xmath63pc@xmath64 ) and assuming a typical disk size ( @xmath65au @xmath66pc@xmath61 , where @xmath67 is the collisional cross section ) and cluster velocity dispersion ( @xmath68 km s@xmath28 ) implies a disk@xmath11disk collision timescale of @xmath69gyr , roughly 3 orders of magnitude larger than the cluster lifetime .",

    "this is in stark contrast to most ysos in the taurus association , which by comparison are relatively unobscured . given these environmental distinctions , it is worthwhile to examine if they have any impact on disk properties by directly comparing the results for the two regions .    to make the comparison a fair one ,",
    "most of the taurus disk masses were re - calculated from the 850@xmath6 m flux densities in paper i using eqn .  2 , the same parameters adopted here ( see  3.1 ) , and the appropriate distance , @xmath70pc . a subsample of taurus sources have sufficient information to determine @xmath29 from a fit to the full sed ( see table 2 in paper i ) , and in those cases the best - fit disk masses were adopted .",

    "given where such emission originates , this result suggests that the material in the inner ( infrared ) and outer ( submillimeter ) parts of disks is significantly affected by global changes in disk properties .",
    "one of the obvious candidates for the cause of such evolution is the metamorphosis of circumstellar structure , including the dissipation of the envelope ( class i @xmath84 ii ) , the viscous evolution of the accretion disk ( through class ii ) , and the dissipation of the disk ( class ii @xmath84 iii ) . a perhaps equally important contribution to this evolution could be the result of the substantial growth of solid particles . in reality , the submillimeter luminosity is determined by the product @xmath40 : even if the total circumstellar mass remained the same across the evolution sequence , the observed trends could both be explained by the changes in the opacity expected from grain growth .    given the abruptness of the transition at the class ii / iii boundary in the top panel of figure [ alpha_smm ] and the low submillimeter detection rate for class iii sources ( see also paper i ) , it appears that the signatures of the inner and outer disk ( infrared and submillimeter excesses , respectively ) disappear within a short time of one another . in paper",
    "i , we used the standard  duty - cycle \" argument for this based on the very small percentage ( @xmath91% ) of ysos that have long - wavelength ( i.e. , submillimeter ) emission from the outer disk , but no near - infrared excess from the inner disk .",
    "the scarcity of such  transition \" objects suggests that if all disks go through such a phase , it must be rather short in duration ( @xmath92yr ) .",
    "a variety of mechanisms have been proposed for this rapid radial evolution , from planet formation ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) to rapid mass loss in photoevaporative winds @xcite .      despite the above effort to associate changes in the submillimeter properties of circumstellar dust with an empirical evolution sequence , it is still not possible to tie this sequence to an absolute timeframe .",
    "an alternative examination of disk evolution can be made by relating disk and stellar parameters , particularly masses ( @xmath93 ) and ages ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "to determine the latter , we first collected spectral classifications ( see table [ results_table ] ) and optical / near - infrared photometry from the literature @xcite . for sources in the surveys of @xcite or @xcite , we simply adopted their stellar masses and ages .",
    "for the remainder of the sample , we used the spectral type@xmath11effective temperature scale , intrinsic colors , and bolometric corrections tabulated by @xcite .",
    "visual extinctions were calculated from color excesses ( in the optical - red whenever available ) and the @xcite extinction law .",
    "stellar luminosities were then computed from the de - reddened photometry and appropriate bolometric correction .",
    "stellar masses and ages were determined by reference to the @xcite theoretical pre@xmath11main - sequence mass tracks and isochrones in an h - r diagram .",
    "this is the same technique adopted for the taurus ysos in paper i , and is similar in practice to that utilized by @xcite .",
    "the stellar mass and age distributions were already highlighted in figure [ sampleprops ] .",
    "the @xmath0 oph sample is slightly younger than the taurus sample , with a median age of @xmath80.7myr compared to @xmath81myr .",
    "the cumulative distributions of disk - to - star mass ratios ( @xmath95 ) for class ii sources in both the @xmath0 oph ( lines ) and taurus ( grayscale ) samples are shown together in figure [ cdf_mdms ] .",
    "the @xmath0 oph sources generally exhibit slightly higher mass ratios than their taurus counterparts , although the @xmath95 distributions for the two regions are not formally different in a statistical sense .",
    "the median ratio in @xmath0 oph is @xmath96% , compared to @xmath80.8%  for taurus . in this case , selection effects may be mimicking a subtle diagnostic of disk evolution from the slightly younger @xmath0 oph sample to the more mature taurus ysos .",
    "the @xmath0 oph sample does have a somewhat different @xmath93 distribution , suggesting that any true hint of a change in @xmath95 as a function of cluster age should await larger samples with more similarity in their stellar properties .",
    "figure [ age_smm ] exhibits the variations of @xmath29 , @xmath95 , and @xmath45 with time for the combined @xmath0 oph and taurus sample . while there is a large scatter of disk properties at",
    "any given time , some marginal trends are apparent .",
    "although a definitive correlation between @xmath29 and @xmath94 remains unconfirmed , there are clearly more non - detections as the stars get older . using survival analysis techniques to incorporate upper limits , the cox proportional hazard model , generalized kendall s tau , and spearman s rho correlation tests @xcite all suggest that the disk - to - star mass ratio is indeed correlated with the stellar age , dropping from a few percent at @xmath80.1myr to a factor of 30 or more lower by 10myr",
    ". it would be useful to measure disk masses for clusters with slightly _ older _ ages to confirm such trends , so that the strength of the correlation does not hinge on the youngest sources ( i.e. , @xmath97yr ) , where the isochrones are less trustworthy .",
    "no obvious trend between @xmath45 and age is apparent .    before moving on ,",
    "it is worthwhile to comment on the adopted distance ( @xmath98pc ) and how alternative values would be expected to affect the above analysis . following @xcite and others",
    ", we based the choice of @xmath99 on the typical range of @xmath8130@xmath11170pc from measurements of stars in the larger upper scorpius complex that encompasses the @xmath0 oph clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , other authors have focused on the near end of that range , using the @xmath100pc advocated by de geus and colleagues based on two arguments suggesting that the dark clouds are in the upper sco foreground : ( @xmath101 ) the morphology of the distance modulus vs. extinction diagram for upper sco sources near the @xmath0 oph cloud edge @xcite , and ( @xmath102 ) some circumstantial evidence from the morphology of the local ism @xcite .",
    "if this closer distance is adopted , all luminosities utilized above are reduced by @xmath830% , with two important consequences .",
    "first , the decreased bolometric luminosities in the h - r diagram would result in considerably older ages for the @xmath0 oph sample ( stellar masses would remain approximately the same , owing to the essentially vertical tracks in this diagram ) . with the roughly logarithmic behavior of isochrones along the h - r diagram luminosity axis , the increase in @xmath94",
    "could be a factor of 2@xmath114 .",
    "second , this nearer distance would lead to a substantial discrepancy in the @xmath0 oph and taurus @xmath29 distributions , such that disks in the former region would be significantly less massive . taken together , using a distance as close as 125pc",
    "would imply that @xmath0 oph ysos are _ older _ than their taurus counterparts , and that disk masses have decreased substantially over the corresponding age difference .",
    "obviously using ages from the h - r diagram is not an ideal way to constrain a cluster distance .",
    "however , in this case it does not really make sense that the much more deeply embedded ysos in @xmath0 oph are older than their essentially unobscured taurus counterparts .",
    "perhaps this issue can be resolved with a more complete census of the stellar population in the @xmath0 oph clouds , along the lines of the work done by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "now that large submillimeter photometry samples of ysos for the @xmath0 oph and taurus associations have been collected , it is appropriate to present quantitative reference values for some of the basic properties of their circumstellar environments .",
    "the cumulative distributions of the censored datasets presented above were used to determine the median values of @xmath29 , @xmath95 , and @xmath45 compiled in table [ benchmark_table ] for various evolutionary states .",
    "here we have distinguished the class iii sources ( @xmath77 ) into two categories : those with submillimeter detections are termed  transition \" objects ( because dust in the inner disk is largely absent , while a significant outer disk remains ) and those undetected sources retain the standard class iii label .",
    "these benchmark values clearly highlight the evolution in the submillimeter properties that have been carefully determined in this work and paper i. figure [ evolution ] graphically illustrates the trend of decreasing @xmath103 along this sequence , with representative error bars showing the distribution quartiles .",
    "typical disk masses are similar to the mmsn for much of their evolution , only dropping substantially at the end of the class ii stage .",
    "the transition disks have a typical disk mass roughly an order of magnitude lower than the mmsn value , corresponding roughly to a jupiter mass of material .",
    "the stringent stacked upper limit placed on the remaining class iii disks is more than an order of magnitude lower still , suggesting that primordial circumstellar disks at this stage in evolution are probably non - existent .",
    "however , this limit still does not rule out the presence of low - mass debris disks similar to those noted around older nearby stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the accretion disks present in the class ii stage of evolution are generally regarded as the birthsites of planetary systems . as such , their properties are directly relevant for constraining the initial conditions available for the planet formation process . in light of their significance in this matter ,",
    "figure [ benchmarks ] shows the differential @xmath29 and @xmath45 distributions for the @xmath0 oph and taurus class ii sources that have firm submillimeter detections .",
    "compiled from 125 individual sources , this distribution of disk masses peaks at @xmath80.01m@xmath2 ( the mmsn value ) and covers a fairly wide dispersion . as would be expected from the analysis of individual regions presented here and in paper i , the @xmath45 distribution for these sources has a relatively narrow peak centered around @xmath104 . with the similarities between the disk properties in the two star - forming regions (  3.3 )",
    ", these values should represent a combined , universal description of the most basic submillimeter properties of class ii disks .",
    "but how precisely are the values of these properties constrained in an absolute sense ?",
    "of course , the submillimeter colors are empirically measured quantities and , aside from occasionally large error bars , their values are firmly determined .",
    "the challenge is interpreting the @xmath45 values in terms of the solid particle population in these disks .",
    "the evidence is now fairly clear on the observational side that the typical disk opacity spectrum is more shallow than in the ism , with @xmath105 deemed appropriate to explain the submillimeter seds ( e.g. , paper i ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this effect has been interpreted as the signature of an increase in the maximum dust particle size , from @xmath8sub - micron sizes in the ism to @xmath8millimeter sizes in a typical disk @xcite .",
    "this amounts to @xmath84 orders of magnitude in particle growth from the time when these dust grains were incorporated into circumstellar disks / envelopes from the ism .",
    "moreover , @xcite emphasize that this actually represents a lower limit on the amount of particle growth , as @xmath50 remains near unity for maximum particle sizes well beyond the ( sub-)millimeter wavelengths used to constrain it ( see their fig .  3 ) .",
    "in essence , submillimeter colors indicate that significant grain growth has occurred in these disks , although it remains unclear exactly how far along it may have proceeded beyond millimeter sizes .    in a sense ,",
    "the opacity acts as an accounting system for the mass budget in a disk .",
    "not all solid particle sizes are generating sufficiently detectable emission at submillimeter wavelengths , and the opacity must also represent the mass contribution of the inefficient emitters in the conversion of a submillimeter luminosity to a disk mass .",
    "a direct , non - degenerate measurement of @xmath20 in a disk is not currently possible , and so a standard approximate value has been fixed and regularly utilized in this field . in their admittedly simplified analysis , @xcite",
    "show that this fixed opacity value , @xmath106@xmath107 g@xmath28 ( as well as @xmath25 ) , is appropriate when the largest particle sizes are @xmath81 mm .",
    "however , the opacity is significantly diminished when the maximum particle size is larger than this value . because @xmath108 , an underestimate of the amount of particle growth in these disks implies an underestimate of their masses .    using laboratory experiments and computer models as a guide for the collision conditions in the disk interior ,",
    "@xcite argue that solid bodies up to @xmath8meter size scales can be formed on rather short timescales .",
    "the work by @xcite shows that meter - sized bodies would have an opacity @xmath810@xmath109 lower than what has been assumed here ( but with the same value of @xmath50 ) .",
    "if such growth is typical , the inferred disk masses may be underestimated by an order of magnitude .",
    "@xcite proposed an interesting test on the validity of the standard opacity prescription . aside from the method used here based on the submillimeter continuum emission from dust , they argued that mass accretion rates ( _ m _ ) determined from optical / ultraviolet spectra can be used to estimate @xmath29 with some reasonable assumptions about the accretion history .",
    "their disk mass estimates , @xmath110__m _ _ , are based solely on observations of the gas phase in the disks , and are therefore completely independent of the values presented here ( see * ? ? ? * regarding the numerical factor of 2 ) . using the stellar ages derived in the previous section and the accretion rates compiled by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "disk masses were calculated using both methods for the subset of @xmath0 oph and taurus class ii sources with the required information available ( i.e. , _ m _ , @xmath94 , and a millimeter detection ) .",
    "stand irrespective of whose numbers are used . ]",
    "a comparison of the two methods for computing @xmath29 in figure [ m_gasdust ] clearly demonstrates that disk masses estimated from dust emission are systematically smaller than those inferred from the accretion rates .",
    "the dotted line in this plot has a slope of unity and bisects the sample into equal - sized groups : it lies roughly an order of magnitude below the solid line marking equality between the two @xmath29 determination methods .",
    "of course , both methods of estimating @xmath29 involve significant uncertainties .",
    "the unknown disk structure in most cases can lead to relatively small uncertainties on the @xmath29 values determined from submillimeter continuum emission ( see paper i ; andrews & williams 2007 ) .",
    "larger uncertainties plague the @xmath29 estimates from the @xcite method , due to both the subtleties of determining _",
    "m _ and the challenges of specifying individual stellar ages . while these undoubtedly contribute to the scatter in figure [ m_gasdust ] , they are unlikely to cause the noted _ systematic _ offset .",
    "for example , a temperature uncertainty could easily translate to a 50%  @xmath29 uncertainty ( see eqn .",
    "2 ) for a given disk . but",
    ", the scatter in figure [ mf_cals ] shows that it is improbable that the average adopted @xmath38 is systematically 2@xmath109 lower than assumed ( let alone the 10@xmath109 needed to explain figure [ m_gasdust ] ) .",
    "a similar argument holds for other disk structure parameters and the stellar ages used in determining @xmath29 from the accretion rate .",
    "perhaps a variety of uncertainties can unfortunately conspire to produce the observed offset . to be fair",
    ", this comparison of @xmath29 estimates from different material phases and spatial locations ( gas near the inner rim and dust spread to the outer radius ) relies on the assumption that accretion disks can be approximated with relatively simple physical prescriptions .",
    "however , given all of these caveats , figure [ m_gasdust ] is really the only check on the absolute precision of @xmath29 measurements currently available .",
    "if solely physical explanations are considered to explain these results , the growth of solid particles to centimeter or meter size scales ( rather than the millimeter scales that correspond to the standard opacity prescription ) is perhaps the most likely cause .",
    "such growth is observationally reinforced by the remarkable centimeter - wave dust emission from large particles recently detected for the tw hya disk @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , the decrease in the opacity expected from this level of grain growth corresponds to disk masses being under - estimated by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "if this is the case , the implications for the planet formation process are significant .",
    "the appropriate shift in the @xmath29 distributions presented here to account for the @xmath20 over - estimate could imply that a relatively large fraction ( perhaps up to one third ) of @xmath81myr old class ii disks are massive enough to be gravitationally unstable ( i.e. , @xmath111 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if these instabilities are indeed common , the giant planet formation process may be rapidly accelerated via direct condensations from spiral density waves / rings ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , compared to the standard core accretion and gas capture models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a concerted effort utilizing both high spatial and spectral resolution multiwavelength submillimeter data ( e.g. , from the alma and e - vla interferometers ) and state - of - the - art disk models may help shed some light on this subject in the near future",
    "we have presented new multiwavelength submillimeter continuum observations of 48 ysos in the @xmath0 oph dark clouds . supplementing this survey with 99 millimeter measurements in the literature ,",
    "we study the circumstellar dust around young stars in this region ; the results are summarized here .    * the statistical distributions of disk masses ( @xmath29 ) , disk - to - star mass ratios , and submillimeter colors ( @xmath45 ; where @xmath112 ) were derived and directly compared with those for the taurus association @xcite . within the uncertainties",

    "* there are statistically significant decreases in @xmath29 and @xmath45 along the canonical yso evolution sequence based on the shape of the infrared sed .",
    "changes in the structure of the circumstellar environment and/or the average particle properties may explain the correlations . * a tentative correlation between the disk - to - star mass ratio and stellar age are noted for the combined samples in both regions .",
    "confirmation with older sources would be beneficial to assess whether or not this relationship depends on isochrone models at early ages ( @xmath113yr ) . * the class ii ysos in @xmath0 oph and taurus",
    "are utilized to establish benchmark values for submillimeter properties in the population considered to be the birthsites of planetary systems : @xmath1m@xmath2 , @xmath3% , and @xmath4 . * an independent disk mass estimate based on the accretion rate @xcite is used to compare with the submillimeter continuum measurements .",
    "the latter are systematically smaller than the former by roughly an order of magnitude on average",
    ". this may be the result of substantial particle growth ( up to @xmath8meter sizes ) , leading to an over - estimate of the opacity used to compute @xmath29 from the submillimeter luminosity .",

    "<S> these basic submillimeter properties of young stellar objects in both environments are shown to be essentially identical . as with their taurus counterparts , the @xmath0 oph circumstellar dust properties </S>",
    "<S> are shown to evolve along an empirical evolution sequence based on the infrared spectral energy distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the combined @xmath0 oph and taurus class ii samples ( 173 sources ) are used to set benchmark values for basic outer disk characteristics : @xmath1m@xmath2 , @xmath3% , and @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 between 350@xmath6 m and 1.3 mm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the precision of these numbers are addressed in the context of substantial solid particle growth in the earliest stages of the planet formation process . </S>",
    "<S> there is some circumstantial evidence that disk masses inferred from submillimeter emission may be under - estimated by up to an order of magnitude . </S>"
