    "the presence of a bar in a disk galaxy implies a non - axisymmetric gravitational field . the high frequency of occurrence of bars ( over 65 percent , de vaucouleurs 1963 ; eskridge et al .",
    "2000 ) and the fact that bars principally consist of an old stellar population @xcite implies that bars are fundamental components in the distribution of mass in galaxies .",
    "bars are believed to be the `` engines '' driving a wide variety of secular evolution processes in galaxy dynamics @xcite .",
    "bar driven secular evolution appears to make significant changes in galaxy structure over a hubble time .",
    "the main components found in barred galaxies include bulges , disks , lenses , and inner and outer rings  and of course the bar itself @xcite .",
    "the absence or presence of a bar led @xcite to develop two separate prongs to his classification tuning fork : the sequence of normal ( unbarred ) spirals sa , sb , and sc , paralleled by a sequence of barred spirals sba , sbb and sbc .",
    "@xcite recognized that galaxies such as ngc 5236 ( m83 ) showed a bar morphology intermediate between that of a normal and a barred spiral .",
    "he introduced the notation sa for unbarred spirals so that he could use the combined notation sab for transitional cases like m83 .    in this paper , we recognize a full continuum of `` bar strengths '' , as does de vaucouleurs , but we propose a numerical quantification of bar strength based on the gravitational forcing of the bar itself , not on visual appearance . from a sample of 36 galaxies ,",
    "we recognize seven bar strength classes : bar class 0 galaxies , which are normal spiral galaxies without any bar ; bar class 1 and 2 galaxies , which show ovals and weak bars ( which de vaucouleurs would have classified in his sab class ) ; and bar class 2 - 6 galaxies , which encompass all galaxies classified as sb by hubble and de vaucouleurs .",
    "our numerical quantification of bar strength is derived from the non - axisymmetric force field of a galaxy inferred from the near - infrared light distribution .",
    "near - infrared @xmath1-band ( effective wavelength 1.6@xmath2 ) and @xmath3-band ( effective wavelength 2.2 @xmath2 ) images beautifully reveal the old stellar population or ` backbone ' of spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "the near - infrared light comes principally from old giant and supergiant stars @xcite .",
    "the extinction at @xmath1 and @xmath3 is only 0.1 - 0.2 times that in visual light , so that dust has only a minimal effect on the inferred potentials .",
    "a rich duality of spiral structure has been found from studies of optical and near - infrared images ; a spiral galaxy may present two completely different morphologies when examined optically and in the near - infrared @xcite .    in the optical",
    ", dust often hides bars , as in the milky way .",
    "seventy percent of spirals classified in the _ carnegie atlas of galaxies _ @xcite , based on hubble bins , are classified as unbarred .",
    "this fraction drops to 27% when these galaxies are imaged in the near - infrared @xcite .",
    "the remaining 43 percent show ovals or bars in the dust - penetrated regime .",
    "this high percentage of bars in the near - infrared agrees with the findings of @xcite , who found that 90% of a sample of 45 galaxies showed some evidence of a bar in the @xmath3-band .",
    "a variety of quantitative parameters has been suggested or could be interpreted to represent a measure of the `` strength '' of a bar .",
    "the bar - interbar contrast , developed by @xcite , can distinguish strong bars from weak bars , but may connect only indirectly to an actual bar strength .",
    "sometimes the maximum bar - interbar contrast occurs inside the radius of the bar , but in some cases it may occur outside the ends of the bar , as in ngc 1433 @xcite . also , @xcite note that bar - interbar contrasts may be weakened by resolution and seeing effects .",
    "@xcite also used fourier intensity amplitudes to derive relative bar luminosities in terms of @xmath4 = 2 and 4 components .",
    "relative to the total luminosity of the disk within the standard isophote having @xmath5 = 25.0 mag arcsec@xmath6 , the bar luminosity fraction was found to range from less than 1% to more than 20% .",
    "@xcite derive similar parameters for six barred galaxies , including the @xmath4 = 6 term .",
    "the most popular bar strength parameter , because of its simplicity , is the deprojected bar ellipticity , @xmath7 , developed by @xcite and suggested by analytical models @xcite to be a readily accessible measure of the strengths of bars that does not depend on spectroscopic observations , surface photometry , or mass - to - light ratio assumptions . @xcite",
    "derived @xmath7 for more than 100 spiral galaxies by visual inspection of published optical photographs , and noted that the slope of chemical abundance gradients @xcite as well as the presence of nuclear star formation @xcite depends on @xmath7 .",
    "this parameter ( or its equivalent , @xmath8 ) has also been used in a number of other recent papers @xcite .",
    "@xcite describe an algorithm that automatically derives @xmath8 from moments of the galaxy image taken at various cuts relative to the maximum flux level .",
    "this approach is useful for high redshift morphological studies . @xcite",
    "describe a refinement on bar axis ratio using a parameter @xmath9 , defined as `` the minimum fraction of the bar s stars that one would have to rearrange in order to transform the structure into an axisymmetric distribution . ''",
    "@xcite notes that @xmath7 is not a complete description of bar strength , but merely the most accessible one .",
    "@xcite developed another quantitative approach to bar strength that utilized near - infrared surface photometry . in their method , the bar is defined to be the light remaining after disk and bulge components are subtracted .",
    "this light is converted into a parameter known as `` equivalent angle '' ( ea ) which is defined to be `` the angle subtended at the centre of the galaxy by a sector of the underlying disk and bulge that emits as much light as the bar component , within the same radial limits . ''",
    "an advantage of this method is that it accounts for both conventional bars as well as ovals .",
    "however , the method relies on full bulge / disk photometric decompositions which can be very difficult for strongly - barred galaxies . @xcite",
    "derived another flux parameter , @xmath10 , representing the ratio of the flux inside the bar to that outside the bar area .",
    "they argue that this parameter and @xmath7 indicate that stronger bars are accompanied by a lower degree of symmetry of star formation in the spiral arms .    in each of these methods ,",
    "the bar itself has to be defined , e.g. , where it appears to start , where it appears to end , or where the maximum ellipticity is achieved .",
    "our approach here is different , and is based instead on the torques induced by the rigidly rotating bar , without first having to accurately define and isolate it relative to the other components in a galaxy .",
    "the most elegant way of measuring the torques of bars embedded in disks is actually an old idea .",
    "given the gravitational potential @xmath11 in the disk plane , @xcite proposed defining the bar strength at radius @xmath12 as    @xmath13    where @xmath14 = @xmath15 represents the maximum amplitude of the tangential force at radius @xmath12 and @xmath16 is the mean axisymmetric radial force at the same radius , derived from the @xmath4 = 0 component of the gravitational potential . although @xmath17 depends on radius , the maximum value of @xmath17 can provide a single measure of bar strength for a whole galaxy , if the gravitational potential is known . with the advent of near - infrared arrays , and the availability of many high quality @xmath3 and @xmath1-band images of galaxies covering a range of apparent bar morphologies ,",
    "it has become possible for the first time to use the idea in equation 1 in a practical way to directly measure the strengths of bars from their force fields for a large number of galaxies .",
    "this provides us with an opportunity to develop a consistent and robust scheme of dust - penetrated classification of bars embedded within disks .",
    "we outline our application of equation 1 here in a preliminary way using a small sample of near - infrared images , and discuss its advantages and disadvantages over the methods just described .",
    "our subset of near - infrared images comes mainly from a much larger sample used to develop a near - infrared classification scheme of spiral galaxies , based on a wide variety of telescopes and detectors . except for maffei 2 and",
    "m101 , full details of the observing procedures , integration times , filters and image scales have been described and published in @xcite and references therein .",
    "the images of maffei 2 and m101 that we have used are from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; jarrett 2000 ) , and have an image scale of 1  pix@xmath18 .",
    "@xcite reviews the principal issues in deriving gravitational potentials from near - infrared images .",
    "the principal assumption is that the light traces the mass , i.e. , the mass - to - light ratio is constant across much of the disk .",
    "then the potential in two dimensions can be derived as the convolution of the mass density with the function @xmath19 using fast fourier transform techniques ( binney and tremaine 1987 , section 2.8 ) .",
    "the validity of the constant @xmath20 assumption can be evaluated from detailed rotation curve studies , or from multi - color near - infrared surface photometry .",
    "for example , @xcite reported an analysis of a sample of more than 550 h@xmath21 rotation curves and @xmath22-band surface photometric profiles derived by @xcite , which shows that the stellar mass distribution alone , with @xmath20 @xmath23 constant , reproduces the observed optical rotation curves for about 97 percent of their sample .",
    "the rotation curve morphologies cited by freeman span the entire range : from almost entirely solid body to almost entirely flat . in a more recent study , @xcite corroborate this result , and show that the optical rotation curves of spiral galaxies may be fitted by a constant mass - to - light ratio ( except for dwarf galaxies , none of which we study here ) .",
    "constraints on the dark halo content of barred galaxies may also be deduced from the dynamical friction or drag of bars rotating within dark matter halos .",
    "the studies of debattista and sellwood ( 1998 , 2000 ) indicate that bars are only able to maintain their high pattern speeds if the disk itself provides most of the gravitational potential  a high central density , dark matter halo would simply provide too much drag on the bar .",
    "such independent studies suggest that light effectively traces mass within the optical disks of barred spiral galaxies .",
    "a detailed dynamical study of one barred spiral , ngc 4123 , by @xcite shows that the inner regions of the disk must be at 90 - 100% of the required `` maximum disk '' forcing .    the method and program that we will use to derive potentials for our sample galaxies",
    "is described by @xcite , hereafter qfg . these authors describe a practical application of the convolution equations which can be used on two - dimensional images and which explicitly accounts for disk thickness . by assuming the @xmath24-dependence of the mass density is independent of position in the plane",
    ", the potential can be derived as the convolution of the image intensities with a function that integrates over the vertical dependence of the density , @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath24-dependence of the density in an isothermal sheet varies as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the isothermal scale height .",
    "@xcite showed that this representation applies well to surface photometry of some edge - on galaxies .",
    "however , @xcite found that an exponential dependence of @xmath25 provides a better description of the vertical light distribution in ic 2531 . in their analysis of ngc 4314 , qfg estimated the exponential scale height @xmath28 as ( 1/12)@xmath29 , where @xmath29 is the radial scalelength .",
    "qfg also tested the constant @xmath20 assumption by deriving the @xmath30 color index across the disk of ngc 4314 .",
    "little color variation was found , prompting them to conclude the constant @xmath20 assumption was realistic , especially in the bar region .",
    "the issue of whether to use an exponential rather than an isothermal density law in our analysis is a complex one .",
    "@xcite has presented a new detailed study of highly inclined disk galaxies in the @xmath31 ( 2.1 @xmath32 m ) band .",
    "since the near - infrared light is relatively insensitive to contamination by galactic dust , he has followed the vertical light distributions down to the galactic planes .",
    "he finds that such distributions are more peaked than expected for a @xmath33 distribution , but rounder than an exponential function .",
    "however , he has demonstrated that it is possible for all the galaxies in his sample to have intrinsically exponential vertical surface brightness distributions . @xcite",
    "have demonstrated that disks which are exponential in both the radial and perpendicular directions give excellent fits to the profoundly asymmetric red - to - blue @xmath34 color profiles found along the minor axes of many spiral galaxies .",
    "the scaleheights of our largely face - on galaxies are not known , thus we can only assume values in our analysis .",
    "as noted by @xcite , some bars are thicker than their disks , while others are probably about the same thickness .",
    "he notes that the bar / bulge of our galaxy has a similar exponential scale height to the old disk .",
    "the average blue absolute magnitude of the galaxies in our sample is @xmath3520.5 @xmath36 , comparable to the milky way @xcite .",
    "therefore , for our _ preliminary _ analysis , we adopt , for all of our sample galaxies , @xmath28 = 325 pc , which is the exponential scaleheight of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "not all galaxies do have the same exponential scaleheight : the study by @xcite indicates that late - type galaxies on average have a thinner disk than earlier type systems . to account for possible variations in scaleheight based on morphological type , and for the possibility that some bars are thicker than their disks , we have made separate potential runs for @xmath28 = 225pc and 425pc . in the future",
    ", it should be possible to improve our judgment of @xmath28 by scaling from values of the radial scalelength , as done by qfg .",
    "however , from de grijs s work , the ratio @xmath37 has a rather large scatter , ranging from 4 to 12 over the type range sb to sd , and from 2.5 to 7 at type sb alone .",
    "many of the galaxies in our sample retain their bar strength class values irrespective of scaleheight variations from 225pc to 425pc .",
    "when a galaxy does move from one bar strength to the next , the effect of decreasing the scaleheight is to increase the bar strength ; increasing the scaleheight leads to a decrease in the bar strength .",
    "these effects were also noted by qfg in their study of ngc 4314 and by @xcite in their study of ic 4214 . in our analysis ,",
    "an uncertainty of @xmath38100pc in @xmath28 produces an average uncertainty of @xmath3913% in bar strength .",
    "our procedure for calculating the bar strength involved several steps : ( 1 ) deprojection of a sky - subtracted @xmath1 or @xmath3-band image , using position angles and isophotal axis ratios from rc3 @xcite , except for the ringed galaxies ngc 1326 , 1433 , 3054 , 3081 , 6300 , eso 566@xmath3524 , and eso 565@xmath3511 , where the deprojections are based on deep photometric and optical or hi kinematic studies @xcite ; ( 2 ) expansion or contraction of the array to dimensions of 2@xmath40 , as required by the qfg fast fourier transform analysis ; ( 3 ) calculation of the potential with an arbitrary mass - to - light ratio of 1.00 , a scaleheight of 225 , 325 , or 425 pc , and a distance from @xcite or ( for galaxies not in this catalogue ) from the linear virgocentric flow model @xcite and a hubble constant of 75 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 ; ( 4 ) derivation of the @xmath4 = 0 , or axisymmetric , part of the derived potential ; ( 5 ) calculation of the mean axisymmetric radial ( @xmath41 ) and tangential ( @xmath42 ) force fields ; and ( 6 ) computation of the ratio map ,    @xmath43    note that the distance is needed only because we are assuming scaleheights in parsecs .",
    "if we could infer @xmath28 as a specific fraction of the radial scalelength @xmath29 , then no distance would be required . also , the analysis is independent of the assumed ( constant ) value of the mass - to - light ratio because we are computing a force ratio .",
    "the actual force fields would scale the same way with the mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the ratio map is our principal tool for estimating the bar strength .",
    "figure 1 ( top left ) shows a typical ratio map for a strongly - barred galaxy , ngc 1433 .",
    "the map shows four well - defined regions where the ratio reaches a maximum or minimum around or near the ends of the bar .",
    "this pattern is the _",
    "characteristic signature _ of a bar .",
    "depending on quadrant relative to the bar , these regions can be negative or positive , because the sign of the tangential force changes from quadrant to quadrant ( see figure 1 , top middle ) .",
    "the absolute values of the ratio at these points represent the maxima of @xmath17 in the @xcite formulation . to locate the maxima automatically",
    ", we analyze azimuthal profiles ( 5@xmath44 steps ) of @xmath45 as a function of radius , and then derive @xmath17 at each radius .",
    "then , we derive the value and location of @xmath46 in each quadrant .",
    "let @xmath47 be the value of @xmath46 in quadrant @xmath48 .",
    "then we define the bar strength as    @xmath49    we analyze @xmath0 by quadrant because few galaxies are so symmetric that @xmath17 reaches its maximum at the same radius and value in all quadrants . for example",
    ", the presence of a strong spiral can make the values of @xmath0 somewhat different in the trailing quadrants of the bar compared to the leading quadrants , or some asymmetry in the bar itself can make the regions unequal .",
    "we use the mean error in @xmath0 as a measure of how well the different quadrants agreed in bar strength .",
    "table 1 defines the bar strength classes that we base on the measured values of @xmath0 . except for class 0 ,",
    "each class spans a range of 0.1 centered on a unit value .",
    "thus , bar class 1 includes galaxies having @xmath0 = 0.1@xmath380.05 , bar class 2 includes galaxies having @xmath0 = 0.2@xmath380.05 , etc . with these definitions ,",
    "class 0 involves a narrower range of @xmath0 , since @xmath0 can not be negative as defined .",
    "table 2 lists the bar strengths so derived for a small sample of representative galaxies covering spiral and ring morphologies , and over a range of hubble types .",
    "the parameter listed as the `` family '' in table 2 is from @xcite for all galaxies in the table except ic 4290 , eso 565@xmath3511 , eso 566@xmath3524 , and maffei 2 .",
    "the optical bar classifications for ic 4290 and eso 566@xmath3524 are from @xcite , that for eso 565@xmath3511 is from @xcite , and that for maffei 2 is from @xcite . using the code in table 1 ,",
    "each galaxy in table 2 was assigned into its appropriate bar strength class .",
    "the strongest bars we find reach bar class 6 , where the maximum tangential force reaches about 60% of the mean radial force .",
    "figure 2 shows how well @xmath0 correlates with the de vaucouleurs family parameter in the sample of table 2 .",
    "this shows that the threshold for calling a galaxy `` sb '' seems to be bar class 2 .",
    "apparently , bars become obvious at this strength and the hubble - de vaucouleurs classification can make no further discrimination on bar strength beyond this threshold , so that `` sb '' also includes galaxies up to bar class 6 .",
    "galaxies classified as `` sa '' or `` sab '' mostly range from classes 0 to 2 , with the exception of maffei 2 which is bar class 3 .",
    "maffei 2 , which is a heavily reddened galaxy in the zone of avoidance , is probably the nearest massive sbbc galaxy @xcite .",
    "some of the more weakly - barred galaxies in table 2 required special treatment .",
    "for example , the measured values of @xmath0 for ngc 2997 and ngc 7083 indicate a bar class of 1 , but we have specified their classes as ( 0 ) since there is either no clear bar signature in the ratio map , or the program measured obvious deprojection stretch of the bulge .",
    "the uncertainty attached to each value of @xmath0 in table 2 includes the mean error in @xmath0 from the four quadrants and the uncertainty of @xmath38100pc due to scale height .",
    "it excludes deprojection uncertainties , however .",
    "we consider the @xmath0 values in table 2 preliminary , because orientation parameters of many of the galaxies are manifestly improvable . for our analysis , we mostly used deprojected images that were already available to us , many of which were previously used for defining the dust - penetrated pitch angle classes described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we used well - defined ( kinematically and/or photometrically - based ) orientation parameters mainly for the ringed galaxies at this time since the deprojected images were also already available to us from earlier studies .",
    "we also used well - defined orientation parameters for maffei 2 from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "table 3 shows the impact of large uncertainties in the orientation parameters on @xmath0 for a representative barred galaxy , ngc 1300 .",
    "this is a special case because the bar major axis of this galaxy is nearly along the line of nodes , making its strength very sensitive to the assumed inclination .",
    "uncertainties of @xmath3810@xmath44 on the inclination @xmath48 and line of nodes position angle @xmath50 changes the bar strength over the bar class range 3 - 5 . the rc3 orientation parameters of @xmath48=49@xmath44 and @xmath50 = 106@xmath44 may be compared to the values of 50@xmath44 and 95@xmath44 , respectively , determined from hi kinematics by @xcite . according to table 3 , ngc 1300 is still bar class 4 with england s parameters . in general , whenever the bar minor axis or major axis is nearly along the line of nodes , the effect of inclination will be most serious on @xmath0 .",
    "figure 1 ( bottom three rows ) shows nine galaxies in our sample in a sequence of increasing @xmath0 , with the locations of the maximum points indicated .",
    "the mean position angle difference between the maximum points and the bar depends on the importance of higher order terms in the bar potential .",
    "for example , if the bar is a pure @xmath4 = 2 potential , these points would lie at @xmath3845@xmath44 to the bar axis .",
    "however , in most cases , the angle we find is less than @xmath3845@xmath44 , because of the importance of @xmath4 = 4 and 6 terms in most real bars .",
    "equation 1 offers a straightforward way of deriving bar strength for large numbers of galaxies in an efficient , automatic manner , subject of course to our assumptions .",
    "studies of individual galaxies , such as ngc 7479 @xcite , ngc 4321 @xcite , ngc 4314 ( qfg ) , ngc 1300 @xcite , ngc 1365 @xcite , ngc 4123 @xcite , and ngc 1433 , 3081 , and 6300 @xcite _ corroborate the m / l @xmath23 constant assumption _",
    ", especially in the inner regions of galaxies .",
    "equation 1 s principal advantage , as we see it , is that we do not need to define the bar in any way other than to limit the analysis to the inner regions of a galaxy to avoid strong spiral structure or corner effects",
    ". it can be sensitive to deprojection uncertainties for objects like ngc 1300 ( table 3 ) and also in cases with roughly spherical bulges and significant inclinations , because then the artificial stretching of the bulge can produce a bar - like signature .",
    "however , these are easy to identify since the bulge is stretched along the minor axis , and these are also easy to treat with bulge decomposition if there is little or no actual bar .    excessive star formation could of course impact the computed potentials . it is well - known that young red supergiants , while on the whole contributing only 3% of the total 2.2@xmath32 m flux , can be locally dominant in star - forming regions and contribute up to 33% of the flux @xcite .",
    "we tested the impact of star formation in m100 by removing the obvious star - forming regions in the arms and bar in a @xmath3-band image , assuming that their mass - to - light ratios are much less than that of the old disk .",
    "the removal of these objects had little impact on the estimated bar strength , and the bar class was unchanged .",
    "@xmath0 does not measure the shape of an _ isolated _ bar .",
    "it also accounts for the disk in which the bar is embedded .",
    "a comparison between our bar classes and the bar ellipticity classes of @xcite shows that ellipticity class 7 ( one of the strongest classes in martin s sample ) can have a bar strength class from 2 ( e.g. , m83 ) to 6 ( e.g. , ngc 7479 ) , while an ellipticity class 4 galaxy can be bar strength class 0 ( e.g. , ngc 4653 ) .",
    "another example of an optically strong ellipticity bar class 7 galaxy but with a non - discernable gravitational potential is ngc 4395 ( knapen , private communication ) .",
    "@xmath0 correlates better with the relative bar fraction , @xmath51 , of @xcite , although we have only three galaxies in common .",
    "ngc 1300 , 3992 , and 7479 have relative bar luminosities of 9.2% , 3.7% , and 20% , respectively .",
    "these same galaxies ( for our adopted orientation parameters ) have @xmath0 = 0.42 , 0.35 , and 0.63 , respectively .",
    "both the martin and elmegreens results are based on @xmath52 or @xmath22 images .",
    "our sample does not overlap with the sample of seigar and james ( 1998 ) , and we can not make a comparison between @xmath0 and bar `` equivalent angle '' at this time .    on the other hand ,",
    "as we have noted , @xmath0 can be ( but is not always ) sensitive to the scale height , _ values of which are assumed in this prelimary study_. we find that bar class is significantly sensitive to @xmath28 only for the strongest bars ; however , even in those cases the uncertainty will usually be less than 1 bar class .",
    "our tabulated values of @xmath0 have ignored the shape of the bulge . in each case , the bulge has been assumed to be as flat as the disk , and only in a few cases have we treated the bulge as less flattened than the disk in order to eliminate deprojection stretch .",
    "the assumption of a highly flattened bulge is probably valid for some galaxies , such as for barred spirals with triaxial bulges @xcite .",
    "however , in many galaxies the bulge is a much less flattened component , and even for a face - on galaxy , this could impact our bar strength estimates .",
    "if the light distribution of a spherical bulge is transformed into a potential assuming it is a thin disk , then the axisymmetric radial forces derived will be too large , especially in the inner regions . to evaluate this ,",
    "we modeled the bulge of one of our galaxies , ngc 1433 , whose bulge can be interpreted in terms of a highly flattened triaxial inner section and a more spherical outer section @xcite .",
    "the apparently round part of the bulge of ngc 1433 includes 27% of the total @xmath1-band luminosity and can be modeled as a double exponential with scale lengths of 2  and 11 , both much less than the 80  radius of the bar . using a program that derives forces from the light distribution by modeling the density in terms of spheroids of different flattenings @xcite",
    ", we find that our analysis overestimates the radial forces in ngc 1433 mainly for radii less than 5  where the error can reach a factor of two . at the radius of the bar ,",
    "the effect of the bulge shape is likely to be negligible .",
    "this may not be true in every case , and we will consider the influence of bulge shape in individual cases in more detail in a separate study .",
    "however , we note that it would be incorrect to measure bar strength only on bulge - subtracted images , because the bulge contributes to the axisymmetric background regardless of its shape , and @xmath0 should measure the strength of the bar relative to all axisymmetric luminous components .",
    "the hubble classification of galaxies is based on their optical appearance . as one moves from early to late type spirals , both unbarred and barred ,",
    "the appearance will be dominated more and more by the young population i component of gas and dust .",
    "however , the gaseous population i component may only constitute 5 percent of the dynamical mass of a galaxy @xcite .",
    "the hubble classification does not constrain the _ dynamical mass distribution _ , as corroborated by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "galaxies with bulge - disk ratios differing by a factor of 40 can have very similar shapes to their rotation curves ; galaxies of hubble type a , for example , may belong to any one of three different mass classes @xcite .",
    "a late type galaxy such as ngc 309 ( optical type c ) may co - exist with an early type a evolved disk morphology @xcite .",
    "the decoupling between gaseous and stellar disks can be profound , as reviewed by @xcite .",
    "a classification scheme of spiral galaxies in the near - infrared was recently proposed by @xcite .",
    "the main classification parameter is the dominant fourier harmonic in the spiral arms . in this classification ,",
    "a ubiquity of low order ( @xmath4=1,2 ) fourier modes for both normal and barred galaxies is found in the near - infrared regime , consistent with the modal theory of spiral structure @xcite .",
    "galaxies with a dominant fourier m=1 mode are l = lopsided , while galaxies principally showing an m=2 harmonic are e = evensided . for simplicity ofcourse , any harmonic class can simply be denoted by h@xmath4 , where lopsided and evensided galaxies carry the h1 and h2 designations respectively .",
    "@xcite bring attention those rarer galaxies with higher order dominant harmonics ( e.g. , ngc 5054 , @xmath4=3 , and eso 566@xmath3524 ,",
    "@xmath4=4 ) which are assigned to harmonic classes h3 and h4 , respectively .    within these dust - penetrated harmonic classes",
    ", galaxies are binned into three subclasses based on the pitch angle of the spiral arms , robustly determined from fourier spectra",
    ". evolved stellar disks with tightly wound spiral arms characterized by near - infrared pitch angles of @xmath2310@xmath44 are binned into the @xmath21 class ; the @xmath53 class is an intermediate group , with near - infrared pitch angles of @xmath2325@xmath44 , while open stellar arms with pitch angles of @xmath2340@xmath44 define the @xmath54 class .",
    "these @xmath21 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 classes are inextricably related to the rate of shear a/@xmath55 in the stellar disk . here",
    "a is the first oort constant and @xmath55 is the angular velocity .",
    "falling rotation curves generally give rise to the @xmath21 class , while rising rotation curves give rise to the @xmath54 class . for a complete discussion ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "when imaged in the near - infrared , a hubble or de vaucouleurs early type b galaxy may either belong to class @xmath21 or @xmath53 or @xmath54 .",
    "likewise for the other optical hubble bins .",
    "hubble type and dynamical mass distributions are not correlated @xcite .    in this paper , we propose to simply add the bar strength derived from the inferred gravitational force fields to the shear - related pitch angle classes of @xcite , in order to define a more complete dust - penetrated classification system .",
    "class 0 spirals have no bar or oval ; our strongest bars are class 6 .",
    "figure  [ tuning ] shows a quantitative three - pronged `` tuning fork '' for the near - infrared images of nine spiral galaxies that illustrate the full dust - penetrated classification system for the h2 class .",
    "the images are from @xcite and are overlaid with the contours of the main harmonic , @xmath4=2 .    for example , it is proposed that ngc 5236=m83 ( illustrated in figure 3 ) bear the quantitative classification h2@xmath212 , implying that the bar class is 2 , the galaxy has tightly wound type @xmath21 arms in the dust - penetrated regime , and that there is an evensided two - armed spiral in its evolved stellar disk .",
    "the pitch angles of the spiral arms in barred galaxies of the same hubble type span the entire @xmath21 to @xmath54 range : for example , ngc 3992 and ngc 1365 ( both hubble type",
    "b ) carry the full designation h2@xmath214 and h2@xmath545 respectively .",
    "the tuning fork in figure 3 may serve as a z@xmath230 template when galaxies at z @xmath23 0.5 - 1 are imaged in their restframe @xmath3 dust penetrated 2@xmath2 regime .",
    "it is not a confirmed observational fact that the morphology of galaxies in the hubble deep fields are very different in the past than in the present ( r.i .",
    "thompson , private communication ) when the effects of redshift and surface brightness dimming are fully accounted for @xcite .",
    "we have outlined the derivation of a fully quantitative bar strength class for spiral galaxies , based on the the maximum value of the amplitude of the tangential force to the mean radial force .",
    "although the method is still based on light fluxes , since we use images to infer gravitational potentials , it provides a more direct handle on bar strength than any other light - based methods so far applied .",
    "regardless of what the bar may visually look like , the ratio map will show a pattern of four maxima / minima that can be isolated fairly automatically to give a robust measure of bar strength .",
    "the method is thus free from uncertainties connected with defining bars or of full bulge / disk decompositions . it can be applied quickly and efficiently to many galaxies , and only in some cases",
    "is it necessary to give special treatment to the bulge if it suffers too much deprojection stretch .",
    "bulge shape , dark matter , and star formation have little impact on the bar strength class for our sample galaxies .",
    "the most important effects are vertical scale height and , for highly inclined galaxies , deprojection uncertainties .",
    "the method has much room for refinement .",
    "for example , bulges can be decomposed to eliminate deprojection stretch and their influence on the ratio maps more accurately accounted for .",
    "improved orientation parameters can be used or derived for galaxies as data become available .",
    "appropriate vertical scaleheights could be inferred more reliably from detailed near - infrared surface photometry and the type dependence of @xmath37 .",
    "the validity of the constant @xmath20 assumption could be tested by measuring @xmath30 color distributions .",
    "finally , deprojection uncertainties go beyond simple bulge deprojection stretch to the fundamental uncertainty of deprojecting any galaxy , even if a bulge is not present .",
    "all of these are issues which will be considered in a more detailed forthcoming study .",
    "the addition of our bar strength parameter to the dust - penetrated classification scheme of @xcite now gives a full dynamical appreciation of the range of evolved stellar disks with bars ( figure  [ tuning ] ) .",
