    "electron transport through low dimensional nanostructures to which a microwave ( mw ) field is applied has received increased attention in recent years",
    ". an important characteristic of these systems is that the electron in the system can exchange an energy @xmath0 with the external fields , where @xmath1 , and @xmath2 is the frequency of the external field , thus leading to several new inelastic tunneling channels .",
    "this phenomenon has been called the photon assisted tunneling ( pat ) effect .",
    "the effects of a mw field on superconductivity were investigated by tien @xmath3.@xcite in the 1960s .",
    "later , different theoretical methods were proposed , such as the time - dependent schrdinger equation,@xcite the transfer hamiltonian method,@xcite the master equation @xcite and the keldysh nonequilibrium green s function method.@xcite experimentally , the pat effect has been observed in quantum dot ( qd ) systems with a single qd,@xcite and in a system with double qds.@xcite the observation of the photon - electron pump phenomenon in a qd system which is controlled by an ac field has been reported by kouwenhoven @xmath3.@xcite sun @xmath3 .",
    "have investigated electron tunneling through a qd@xciteand in a quantum - dot - molecule@xcite irradiated by a mw field . besides the single qd system , time - dependent tunneling through double@xcite and triple@xcite coupled qds have also received great attention both experimentally and theoretically , in many cases because of the potential applications in quantum computing devices . when a device is prepared in a semiconductor with a perpendicular electric field , rashba spin - orbit coupling ( soc )",
    "will appear in the system , which leads to a nonzero spin - dependent phase @xmath4.@xcite in addition , the time reversal symmetry can be broken by a magnetic flux @xmath5 .",
    "if both these effects are present , the average current is expected to become spin polarized .",
    "l @xmath3.@xcite have proposed a spin filter using a triple qd system with dc bias . however , to the best of our knowledge , little attention has been paid to spin transport and the occupation number in such device in a mw field , especially a system with rashba soc . in order to study the impact of coupling between qds in a device with three qds , we have constructed a theoretical model to investigate the pat effect and photon - electron pump phenomenon when the electron - electron ( @xmath6 ) interaction , rashba soc and an external magnteic field are all considered .    in this paper , using the keldysh nonequilibrium green s function method , we analytically solve for the time - dependent current through two qds connected in parallel with a side - coupled qd , the whole system being irradiated by a mw field .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . the model and analytic method",
    "are introduced in sec . .",
    "in sec . , we discuss our results including the spin - dependent average current , the occupation numbers and the spin accumulation for various cases .",

    "an ac bias is applied across the leads . ]    as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the system we propose is composed of three qds , which can also be seen as two qds connected in parallel with a third side - coupled qd . the third qd is not directly coupled to the leads under ac bias .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system can be described as : @xmath7    the first term of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( 1 ) describes the lead system : @xmath8 where @xmath9(@xmath10 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath11 ( @xmath12)and bloch wave vector @xmath13 in the @xmath14 lead .",
    "the @xmath14 leads are the left lead and the right lead in the system .",
    "the electron energy @xmath15 . here",
    ", @xmath16 is a single particle energy , @xmath17 is a dc bias ( electron charge @xmath18 ) and the ac bias of frequency @xmath2 is given by @xmath19 .",
    "the effect of ac fields influencing the energy levels of the source and the drain was studied by jauho @xmath3 .. @xcite    the second term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) describes the qd system : @xmath20 where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron in the @xmath23th qd with energy level @xmath24 ; @xmath25 is the single particle energy in the @xmath23th qd .",
    "@xmath26 is the coupling between the qd@xmath27 and the qd@xmath28 and @xmath29 describes the coulomb repulsion energy of the @xmath23th qd .",
    "the last term in eq . ( 1 ) , @xmath30 , describes electron tunneling between the qds and leads : @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents the qds - lead coupling .",
    "according to ref .",
    "28 , the rashba soc has two main effects in a qd system : ( 1 ) an extra spin - dependent phase factor appears in the tunneling matrix , and ( 2 ) interlevel spin - flip can be induced by rashba soc , but not intralevel spin - flip . to simplify the calculation , we assume that each qd has the same energy level .",
    "thus only the first of these two effects is taken into consideration in the present work . in order to simplify the analysis of the self - energies , we use the wide - band limit ( wbl ) , which is an approximation .",
    "the energy dependence of the coupling between the leads and the qds can be neglected by using the wbl . in the wbl",

    "while the transport properties of single and double qds have been well studied,@xcite for completeness and for later discussions , we analyse parallel double qds without a side - coupled third qd in this subsection .",

    "using the eq . ( 11 ) above , the spin - dependent average current of the model can be numerically simulated . in our calculation",
    ", we found that the case in which external mw fields are applied symmetrically ( @xmath56 ) on the leads is same as the case in which the external mw fields are applied directly to the qds,@xcite .",
    "therefore we take @xmath57 in our discussion .",
    "we begin discussion of the double qds with both the rashba soc and the magnetic field considered in a symmetic ac field .",
    "for this situation , fig .",
    "2 shows the spin - dependent average currents as a function of the energy level of the qds .",
    "spin - dependent average currents , @xmath58 ( solid line ) and @xmath59 ( dashed line ) , for qds in parallel as a function of the electron energy level @xmath60 in the qds under ac bias with @xmath61 ( black line ) , @xmath62 ( blue line ) and @xmath63 ( red line ) ( a ) without rashba soc , magnetic field or @xmath6 interaction when @xmath64 ( b ) with the rashba soc @xmath65 and magnetic flux @xmath66 ( blue line ) , @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( red line ) , for @xmath64 and no @xmath6 interaction , ( c ) with rashba soc ( @xmath67 ) , magnetic flux ( @xmath68 ) , for @xmath64 and @xmath69 .",
    "the other parameters are : @xmath70 and @xmath71 . ]    as illustrated in fig .",
    "2(a ) , the dc current ( black solid line ) has a lorentzian line shape whose width is determined by @xmath72 .",
    "the peak of the average current occurs at @xmath73 .",
    "there is no spin splitting when the system does not have either rashba soc or a magnetic field .",
    "in addition , when a harmonic ac source with amplitude @xmath74 ( blue solid line ) is applied , changes caused by the ac field can be discerned .",
    "the current shows two polar values at @xmath75 .",
    "the photo - assisted features are more clearly seen when @xmath76 ( red solid line)in which case , there are side peaks located at @xmath75 and @xmath77 .",
    "these peaks are due to the pat or sideband effect , and each term in the summation of eq .",
    "( 11 ) can be regarded as the contribution of the @xmath78-photon process .",
    "@xmath79 the average current , shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) , is symmetric about @xmath73 when the dc source - drain voltage @xmath80 . from the pat point of view ,",
    "the part of average current with @xmath81 is associated with first absorption and then emission of photons , while the part for @xmath82 is associated with first emission and then absorption i.e. the time reversed counterpart to @xmath81 .",
    "in addition , the ccentral peak at @xmath73 is suppressed which is due to the prefactor @xmath83 in each term of the summation in eq . ( 11 ) , which causes the peak heights for resonant tunneling to become lower for larger @xmath78 .",
    "it can be obtained in our calculation that the sum of the heights of all peaks is equal to the height of the original peak . in the fig .",
    "2(b ) , we show the spin - dependent average current when the soc and magnetic field are both included .",
    "the results show that the spin - dependent average current @xmath84 of the two spin channels are equal in the absence of both soc and a magnetic field , but become quite different when they are included .",
    "there are two remarkable features in the average current characteristics that arise due to rashba soc and the magnetic field .",
    "first , the current has a minimum at @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "we note that the magnitude of the average current can be controlled by @xmath87 . due to the cophase wave functions along the two paths when the rashba soc phase @xmath88 , the current is maximum at @xmath85 . as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) ( blue line ) , when the magnetic field phase is @xmath66 and the soc phase is @xmath65 , all peaks of the spin down current , including the main peaks and sideband peaks , are split at @xmath85 .",
    "however this splitting phenomenon does not occur in the spin up current [ see fig .",
    "the reason is that the sum of the phases is @xmath89 for the spin up current ( @xmath90 ) , but the sum is @xmath91 for the spin down current ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the rashba soc behaves like a momentum dependent magnetic field which is perpendicular to the system .",
    "this effective magnetic field induces a spin - dependent phase difference between the electrons traveling clockwise and counterclockwise between qd@xmath93 and the qd@xmath27 . because of the interference between the wave functions along the two paths when @xmath94 , the current shows a large decrease at @xmath85 for the spin - down channel . as a result , the spin - down channel peaks are split at @xmath85 . the second aspect to note , and",
    "the one on which we will concentrate in the following , is that we can obtain 100% spin polarized current for appropriate values of @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "for example , when @xmath68 and @xmath67 , we can note two cases with zero current at @xmath75 in the spin - down channel .",
    "2(b ) ( red line ) .",
    "in contrast , two non - zero currents occur at the same locations for the spin - up electrons .",
    "thus , a spin - up current can be obtained at @xmath75 . if @xmath95 and @xmath67 or @xmath68 and @xmath96 the conductance curves for the spin - up and spin - down channels are interchanged and a spin - down current can be obtained for @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , the magnitude and direction of the spin polarization of each spin channel can be controlled by the phase factors @xmath5 and @xmath4 , which is useful for designing a spin filter under ac bias .",
    "we can also note that there are two kinds of peak in fig .",
    "2(c ) which is distinguished by having a non - zero @xmath6 interaction .",
    "the a - type peaks are the general pat peaks discussed above for both spin directions and are a distance @xmath97 away from the main peak at @xmath73 .",
    "the ` b ' peaks are also a kind of pat peaks but their positions are modified due to the @xmath6 interaction .",
    "the first ` b ' peak is located at @xmath98 .",
    "the electronic states in the qds are occupied with energy @xmath99 , and peaks at @xmath100 produces as the result of a pat process based on a qd with this energy . in this case ,",
    "due to the @xmath6 interaction , a photon must have an energy @xmath100 in order for it to be absorbed or emitted .",
    "for the asymmetric case ( @xmath101 ) , the spin - dependent average currents , @xmath58 ( solid line ) and @xmath59 ( dashed line ) , are shown as a function of the electron energy level @xmath60 of the qds under an asymmetric ac bias ( a ) with different strengths of rashba soc , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , ( b ) with @xmath66 , @xmath65 , @xmath103 and @xmath105 ( c ) with @xmath66 , @xmath65 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",

    "the subsidiary peak exceeds the main peak ( near @xmath75 ) and can not be neglected .",
    "the shoulder on the left side of the main resonant peak and a negative current on the right side in fig .",
    "3(a ) , result from the electron - photon pump . with increasing @xmath4 ,",
    "the magnitude of the average current is reduced and the shoulder becomes clearer , but the location of the pat peaks is independent of the strength of the rashba soc .",
    "the distance between the pat peaks and the point @xmath73 is almost unchanged , and is equal to @xmath75 .",
    "it should be noted that when both @xmath5 and @xmath4 are taken into account , the current is spin polarized and can be controlled . in fig .",
    "3(b ) , when the system is subject to an asymmetric time - dependent field , if @xmath115 , the spin up current @xmath58 is positive , which means that the spin up current @xmath58 flows along the positive direction ( left to right ) , while the spin down current @xmath59 flows in the negative direction ( right to left ) . in the range @xmath116 , however , the opposite situation occurs .",
    "this means that the current is spin polarized and the polarization can be controlled by the magnetic field and rashba soc in the asymmetric mw situation . here we should point out that since we considered the intradot coulomb interaction in our model , we obtain a series of coulomb oscillation shoulders in fig .",

    "8(a ) shows a numerical calculation of the spin - dependent average current @xmath84 versus @xmath60 under asymmetric ac bias .",
    "for the @xmath54 case , a shoulder occurs on the left side of the main peak , and a negative current shoulder appears on the right side of the main peak .",
    "the negative current shoulder and the positive current shoulder in the curve are due to the electron - photon pump effect . with increased coupling such as @xmath159 ( weak - coupling ) , changes in the spin - up channel caused by the coupling",
    "are too small to discern . however , the shoulder for spin down electrons is higher than for the @xmath54 case .",
    "the height of the shoulder is determined by the coupling .",
    "however , the location of the pat shoulder is independent of the mw field amplitude and the coupling strength .    to examine the effects of strong coupling",
    ", we set @xmath171 , and use @xmath109 , @xmath110 , with the source - drain voltage @xmath172 . in this case",
    "the transmitted electrons flowing in the left lead will be free of the mw fields , and only the transmitted electrons in the right lead feel the mw fields .",
    "the electron - photon pump effect appears as steps in the @xmath84 versus @xmath60 curves as shown in fig .",
    "the locations of the shoulders due to the electron - photon pump are not only at @xmath0 but also at @xmath173 .",
    "this means that the tunneling electron can emit or absorb photons with different frequencies in a more complicated way .",
    "for example , the electron for the @xmath73 energy level can absorb or emit a photon of energy @xmath0 in the usual manner . however , an electron in the @xmath174 energy level may also absorb or emit a photon of energy @xmath0 with the result that coherence effects arise .",
    "the result is a more complicated multiple - pat effect arising from the interplay of the new quantum state formed by the coupling between qd@xmath27 and qd@xmath28 , and the electron - photon pump .",
    "in fact the mw field and the coupling considered in the system cause the new quantum state corresponding to the three qds to participate in the transmission , and the mw field applied on the right lead in an asymmetric way induces the electron - photon pump effect .",
    "in summary , we have studied the pat effect and the electron - photon pump effect through two qds connected in parallel with a side - coupled qd , the whole system being irradiated by a mw field .",
    "the spin - dependent average currents @xmath58 , @xmath59 , the spin occupation @xmath45 and spin accumulation @xmath132 were obtained utilizing the keldysh nonequilibrium green s function method . when only the rashba soc is considered , spin polarization can be produced in the qds , and can be seen in the spin accumulation .",
    "when we consider the combined effect of both rashba soc and a magnetic flux , both the intradot occupation numbers and the time averaged current through the system are polarized .",
    "a pure spin polarized current can be generated due to the nonzero spin - dependent phase @xmath4 and the magnetic flux @xmath5 in the presence of an ac bias .",
    "this provides an efficient way to generate a pure spin polarization current in nanostructures . when qd@xmath27 and qd@xmath28 are coupled , several interesting effects related to the more complicated level structure of the qds are expected to occur .",
    "in particular , the multiple - photon - assisted tunneling is more complicated and a new kind of pat peak obtained by controlling the strength of the coupling arises .",
    "the model considered here can be realized using present technologies .",
    "these results are expected to be useful for device design and quantum computation in the future .",
