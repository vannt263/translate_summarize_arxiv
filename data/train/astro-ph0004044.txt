    "while the stellar distribution perpendicular to the plane ( z - profile ) could result from various `` heating '' processes during the galactic evolution ( toth & ostriker @xcite , hernquist & mihos @xcite ) , the cut - off radius can be used to constrain either the angular momentum of a protocloud ( van der kruit @xcite ) or possible starformation thresholds in the gaseous disk ( kennicutt @xcite ) . + in the following , we have compiled parameters of galactic disks for a total of 31 edge - on galaxies in different optical filters of which 17 objects have been already discussed in paper i. one goal of our detailed comparison of several independent fitting procedures is to study the influence of the applied techniques on resulting disk parameters .",

    "<S> we present detailed three - dimensional modelling of the stellar luminosity distribution for the disks of 31 relatively nearby ( @xmath0 110 mpc ) edge - on spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to most of the standard methods available in the literature we take into account the full three - dimensional information of the disk . </S>",
    "<S> we minimize the difference between the observed 2d - image and an image of our 3d - disk model integrated along the line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> thereby we specify the inclination , the fitting function for the z - distribution of the disk , and the best values for the structural parameters such as scalelength , scaleheight , central surface brightness , and a disk cut - off radius . from a comparison of two independently developed methods we conclude , that the discrepancies e.g. for the scaleheights and scalelengths are of the order of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these differences are not due to the individual method itself , but rather to the selected fitting region , which masks the bulge component , the dust lane , or present foreground stars . </S>",
    "<S> other serious limitations are small but appreciable intrinsic deviations of real disks compared to the simple input model . </S>",
    "<S> + in this paper we describe the methods and present contour plots as well as radial profiles for all galaxies without previously published surface photometry . </S>",
    "<S> resulting parameters are given for the complete sample . </S>"
