    "during the past few years , there has been continuing interest @xcite in higher dimensional kinematical models for proper and unified theory of subluminal ( bradyon ) and superluminal ( tachyon ) objects @xcite .",
    "the problem of representation and localization of extended particles and superluminal objects may be solved only by the use of higher dimensional space .",
    "several attempts of extending special theory of relativity to superluminal realm in the usual four - space @xcite led to controversies @xcite and satisfactory theory for tachyons could not be made acceptable so far .",
    "several experimental investigations @xcite have been shown towards the evidences for the existence of tachyons : particle moving faster than light @xmath1 ( superluminal particles ) .",
    "still there are doubts ( due to lack of experimental verification)@xcite for the existence of tachyons and it still needs the necessity of constructing a self - consistent quantum field theory , which might yield their quantum properties relevant for their production and detection .",
    "the continuing interest of tachyons showed that these particles are not in contradiction to the special theory of relativity .",
    "a basic disagreement in the various models of tachyons was the spin - statistics relationship .",
    "tanaka @xcite , dhar - sudarshan @xcite , aron - sudarshan @xcite assumed the spin for tachyons as that of bradyons . on the other hand",
    ", feinberg @xcite , hamamoto @xcite showed that spin - statistics for tachyons is reversed to that for bradyons .",
    "rajput and coworkers @xcite described a lorentz invariant quantum field theory of tachyons of various spins and showed that tachyons are not localized in space . the scalar and spinor field theory of free tachyons @xcite shows that tachyons are localized in time .",
    "the localization space for the description of tachyons is @xmath0 - space where the role of space and time ( and that of momentum and energy ) are interchanged on passing from bradyons to tachyons .",
    "the initial values of tachyons lie on the hyper plane @xmath2 while those for tachyons lie on @xmath3 .",
    "the space @xmath4 - ( i.e. the localization space for bradyons ) and @xmath0 - ( the time representation space for tachyons ) demonstrate the structural symmetry between these two and directly lead to space - time duality between superluminal and subluminal objects .",
    "supersymmetry , i.e. the fermi - bose symmetry @xcite , is one of the most fascinating discoveries in the history of physics .",
    "the local extension of supersymmetric theories @xcite ( i.e. super gravity ) provides a natural framework for the unification of fundamental interactions of elementary particles .",
    "it was believed earlier @xcite that spin@xmath5 tachyons are quantized only with anti commuting relations but their localization in space creates problem with lorentz invariance .",
    "now it is made clear that tachyons are localized in time and their localization space is @xmath0 - space which behaves as that of bradyons do in @xmath4 - space and as such it is not possible to accelerate directly a particle from @xmath4 - space to @xmath0- space ( or subluminal to superluminal ) for which we need superluminal lorentz transformations ( slt s ) .    keeping these facts in mind , in this paper",
    "we have undertaken the study of the super partner hamiltonians in @xmath0 - space , having the identical energy spectrum , expect for the ground states , and all the potentials exhibiting the shape invariance contain the exact solutions . constructing the operations connecting the states of same energy for super partner hamiltonians @xmath6 and @xmath7 and supersymmetric partner potentials @xmath8 and @xmath9 in @xmath0 - space , all bound state wave functions have been calculated from ground state and shape invariant potentials are obtained for supersymmetric linear harmonic oscillator .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath10 excited state energy of @xmath11 is identical to @xmath12 excited state energy of @xmath13 while any supersymmetric eigen state of one of the super partner potentials in @xmath0 - space is paired in energy with a symmetric eigen state of the other partner potential .",
    "we have also constructed a semi - unitary transformation ( sut ) to obtain the supersymmetric partner hamiltonians for a one dimensional harmonic oscillator and it has been demonstrated that under this transformation in @xmath0 - space the supersymmetric partner @xmath11 loses its ground state but its eigen functions constitute a complete orthonormal set in a subspace of full hilbert space .",
    "in order to over come the various problems associated with superluminal lorentz transformations ( slts ) , six - dimensional formalism @xcite of space time is adopted with the symmetric structure of space and time having three space and three time components of a six dimensional space - time . in this formalism , a subluminal observer @xmath14 in the usual @xmath15 space is surrounded by a neighbourhood in which one measures the scalar time @xmath16 and spatial vector @xmath17 out of six independent coordinates @xmath18 of the six - dimensional space @xmath19 . on passing from @xmath20 to @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 stands the tachyon ) via imaginary slt s , the usual of observer in @xmath19 will appear as @xmath23 to the observer @xmath14 in @xmath19 . the resulting space for bradyons and tachyons is thus identified as the @xmath19- or @xmath24 space where both space and time as well as energy and momentum are considered as vector quantities .",
    "superluminal lorentz transformations ( slts ) between two frames @xmath25 and @xmath26 moving with velocity @xmath27 are defined in @xmath19- or @xmath24 space as follows ;    @xmath28    where @xmath29 these transformations lead to the mixing of space and time coordinates for transcendental tachyonic objects , @xmath30 where equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) takes the following form ;    @xmath31    it shows that we may have only two four dimensional slices of @xmath19- or @xmath24 space @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "when any reference frame describes bradyonic objects it is necessary to describe @xmath34\\,(r^{4}-space)$ ] so that the coordinates @xmath35 and @xmath36 are not observed or couple together giving @xmath37 . on the other hand when a frame describes bradyonic object in frame @xmath25 , it will describe a tachyonic object ( with velocity @xmath38 ) in @xmath26 with @xmath39 space i.e.@xmath40=[z,\\ , t_{x},\\ , t_{y},\\ , t_{z}](t^{4}-space).$ ]    as such , we define @xmath39 space as @xmath0- space or @xmath41 space where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are not observed but coupled together giving rise to @xmath44 . as such , the spaces @xmath4 and @xmath0 are two observational slices of @xmath19- or @xmath24 space .",
    "unfortunately the space @xmath45 is not consistent with special theory of relativity and accordingly the subluminal and superluminal lorentz transformations lose their meaning in @xmath19- or @xmath46 space in the sense that these transformations do not represent either the bradyonic or tachyonic objects in this space .",
    "it has been shown earlier @xcite that the true localizations space for bradyons is @xmath4 - space while that for tachyons is @xmath0 - space .",
    "so a bradyonic @xmath47 space now maps to a tachyonic @xmath48 space or vice versa i.e.    @xmath49    hence @xmath4 , the suitable space for describing bradyonic phenomena , is mapped under slt s onto the space @xmath0 which is the space suitable to describe the tachyonic phenomena . in such formalism",
    "we get the following mapping for the position four - vector @xmath50 , four - differential @xmath51 and four - potential @xmath52 under slt s as    @xmath53    @xmath54    where @xmath55 are @xmath56 differential operators in terms of three spatial and three temporal coordinates , respectively . applying these mappings on the equations for generalized electric field , magnetic field and lorentz force associated with dyons ,",
    "we get the following expressions respectively for generalized electric field , magnetic field and lorentz force on dyons under superluminal transformations in @xmath0 - space i.e. ;    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is introdued @xcite as magnetic four - potential beside the electric four - potential @xmath59 and @xmath60 is described as generalized electromagnetic vector field in subluminal frame of reference ; and @xmath61 is inverse velocity .",
    "these equations show the superluminal fields associated with tachyonic dyons containing both longitudinal and transverse parts .",
    "equation @xmath62 describes the lorentz force acting on dyon in @xmath0-space .",
    "it may be recalled as the force of tachyonic dyon which is similar to that of dyonic force in @xmath4- space if we replace the particle velocity @xmath63 to that of the inverse velocity @xmath61 alon with the role of space variables is interchanged with time variables .",
    "so , the theories of tachyons be better understood in @xmath0- space where they behave as bradyons do in @xmath4- space . as such in view of their localizability and other quantum properties , we can formulate the supersymmetric theories of tachyons in @xmath0- space in the parallel ground of bradyonic supersymmetric theories in @xmath4- space .",
    "similarly , the total hamiltonian @xmath64 of a tachyonic supersymmetric system may be decomposed in to its bosonic part @xmath65 and the fermionic part @xmath66 such that    @xmath67    with    @xmath68    and    @xmath69=-iw''(t)y_{t}\\label{eq:8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where@xmath70is the rest mass of tachyon , @xmath71 is super potential while @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the fermionic variables in @xmath0- space describing spin degree of freedom and the operator @xmath74 is defined as    @xmath75    in ( [ eq:8 ] ) , prime and double prime denote first and second order derivatives .",

    "alternatively , supersymmetric quantum mechanics may be worked out in terms of a pair of bosonic hamiltonians @xmath13 and @xmath11 which are supersymmetric partners of supersymmetric hamiltonian i.e. ,    @xmath91    in order to construct these super partner hamiltonians for the system described by equation ( [ eq:6 ] ) , let us introduce the potential @xmath9 whose ground state energy has been adjusted to zero with the corresponding ground state wave function given by ;    @xmath92.\\label{eq:18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    substituting it in the schrdinger equation ( in the units of @xmath93 ) , we get    @xmath94    hence we have the following hamiltonian corresponding to the potential ,    @xmath95    if the ground state wave function @xmath96 is square integrable then the supersymmetry will be broken .",
    "this hamiltonian may also be written in the following form in terms of bosonic operator @xmath97 and @xmath98 ;    @xmath99    where    @xmath100    let us introduce the hamiltonian    @xmath101    where    @xmath102    the potentials @xmath103 and @xmath104 are called supersymmetric partner potentials and @xmath105 is the hamiltonian corresponding to the potential @xmath8 . from equations ( [ eq:13 ] ) and ( [ eq:18 ] ) , we get    @xmath106 & = & w^{2}(t);\\nonumber \\\\",
