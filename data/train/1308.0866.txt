    "graphene is an easily accessible , truly two - dimensional system which is attractive from the point of view of both the basic physics and possible applications . in the past decade",
    ", it has attracted immense investigations.@xcite among these works , the time - resolved optical pump - probe measurement is widely used to investigate the dynamics of electrons in graphene.@xcite with this method , a pump pulse is used to excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction one and then a time - delayed probe pulse with the probe - photon energy @xmath0 is applied to detect the differential transmission ( dt ) .",
    "the experimentally obtained dt under a probe - photon energy much higher than twice of the fermi energy is often positive with its fast relaxation of several hundred femtoseconds followed by a slower picosecond relaxation.@xcite from the dt , the conductivity @xmath1 is extracted . moreover , if @xmath0 is also much larger than the scattering rate and the electrons are considered to be free , the conductivity is given by ( @xmath2)@xcite @xmath3 , \\label{conductivityinter}\\ ] ] in which @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the electron distribution with @xmath6 @xmath7 representing the conduction ( valence ) band and @xmath8 stands for the resonant absorption state . with this equation and the temporal evolution of @xmath9 , the evolution of the electron distribution difference at the resonant absorption state @xmath10",
    "is directly detected .",
    "in addition to the positive dt , the negative dt , which indicates the increase of the conductivity after the pumping ( positive differential conductivity ) , has also been observed in different experiments.@xcite sun _",
    "et al . _ reported a negative dt in a system of very high equilibrium fermi energy , with the probe - photon energy being lower than twice of the fermi energy.@xcite soon after that , the negative dt was also observed by george _",
    "_ in the case where the probe - photon energy is as low as tens of mev.@xcite these two kinds of negative dt can be well understood theoretically . by considering the inter - band conductivity of free electrons [ eq .  ( [ conductivityinter ] ) ] , the negative dt reported by sun _ et al._@xcite is shown to come from the weakening of the pauli blocking due to the heating of electrons by the pump pulse.@xcite as for the case with low probe - photon energy,@xcite the heating of the electrons can still contribute to the negative dt.@xcite nevertheless , with the scattering taken into consideration , the intra - band conductivity was found to be also important for the negative dt.@xcite    in contrast to the previous two cases with moderate or small probe - photon energies , the negative dt has also been observed with the probe - photon energy being very high ( e.g. , @xmath11",
    "ev).@xcite the mechanisms lead to this kind of negative dt is still unclear . at such high probe - photon energy ,",
    "the fermi surface is less possible to be as high as half of the probe - photon energy and hence the weakening of the pauli blocking is less important . as for the intra - band conductivity , its strength is largely suppressed and hence whether it is strong enough to lead to the negative dt is unclear .",
    "moreover , in previous works investigating problems of the negative dt , the scattering strength used was assumed to be constant.@xcite with constant scattering strength , the inter - band conductivity can not lead to the negative dt .",
    "nevertheless , with the variation of the scattering strength taken into consideration , whether it can lead to negative dt is still unknown .",
    "in addition , the variation of the coulomb self - energy after the pumping was also suggested to be the mechanism leading to the increase of the inter - band conductivity and hence the negative dt.@xcite however , whether it is strong enough to lead to a negative dt has not been fully theoretically demonstrated and it is even claimed that the negative dt itself may come from external factors.@xcite    in this work , we calculate the optical conductivity based on the linear response theory with the keldysh green function approach@xcite by taking into account the contribution of the electron - phonon and the electron - impurity scatterings as well as the coulomb self - energy explicitly .",
    "we show that for graphene with low equilibrium electron density without the coulomb - hole ( ch ) self - energy,@xcite the negative dt can appear when the probe - photon energy @xmath0 is low ( in the order of the scattering rate ) or when @xmath0 is high ( much larger than the scattering rate ) . for the low @xmath0 case",
    ", the negative dt mainly comes from the large increase of the intra - band conductivity after the pumping due to the large variation of the electron distribution . as for the high @xmath0 case ,",
    "the negative dt is shown to tend to appear when the hot - electron temperature @xmath12 is close to the equilibrium one and the chemical potential is higher than the equilibrium chemical potential but considerably lower than @xmath13 .",
    "this negative dt is found to come from the variation of both the intra- and the inter - band components of the conductivity .",
    "especially , for the inter - band conductivity , we find that both the scattering and the hartree - fock ( hf ) self - energy can cause the negative dt.@xcite in addition , the influence of ch self - energy is also addressed .",

    "the phonon temperature is chosen to be the same as the electrons and the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figsw2](e ) .",
    "one finds that the positive differential conductivity can appear when @xmath121  k. to further identify the contributions of the inter- and intra - band components , we plot the temperature dependence of the differential conductivity in fig .",
    "[ figsw2](f ) with @xmath122  mev .",
    "one finds that the total differential conductivity ( solid curve ) is obviously larger than the inter - band one ( dotted curve ) .",
    "this indicates the important positive contribution of the intra - band component .",
    "moreover , it is also shown that the difference between the inter - band differential conductivities with ( red dotted curve ) and without ( green dashed curve ) the hf self - energy varies slowly with the temperature .",
    "this means that in the parameter range investigated here , the influence of temperature on the hf self - energy is small .",
    "in addition , it is also found that the inter - band differential conductivity with only scattering ( i.e. , without the hf self - energy ) can also be positive when @xmath12 is close to the equilibrium one ( 300  k ) .",
    "however , it decreases with the increase of the temperature quickly and becomes negative when @xmath123  k.    now , we can lay out the conditions for the emergence of the negative dt ( or equivalently , positive differential conductivity ) in graphene with low equilibrium electron density .",
    "the negative dt can appear both in the low probe - photon energy @xmath0 ( in the order of the scattering rate ) case and in the high @xmath0 case ( much larger than the scattering rate ) .",
    "for the low @xmath0 case , this negative dt mainly comes from the increase of the intra - band conductivity .",
    "this increase is mainly due to the large variation of the electron distribution after the pumping and is almost not influenced by the hf self - energy in the temperature range investigated here . as for the high @xmath0 case , although the dt for free electrons [ i.e. , the one with the conductivity calculated from eq .",
    "( [ conductivityinter ] ) ] can never be negative , the negative dt can appear if the scattering is taken into consideration . with the scattering",
    ", the inter - band conductivity tends to lead to a negative dt when the hot - electron temperature @xmath12 is close to the equilibrium one and the chemical potential @xmath74 is higher than the equilibrium chemical potential but considerably smaller than @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , this region of the negative dt determined by the inter - band conductivity can be further expanded by the intra - band one , which always tends to decrease the dt if @xmath12 and @xmath74 increase after the pumping .",
    "furthermore , the hf self - energy can also contribute to the negative dt by increasing the inter - band differential conductivity when @xmath74 is much larger than the equilibrium chemical potential ( about several hundred milli - electron volts larger ) in the temperature range usually estimated in the experiment ( around 1000  k ) .",
    "this further expands the region of the negative dt at high @xmath0 .",
    "we further note that if the phonon temperature is considered to be smaller than that of electrons , the inter - band differential conductivity increases , which also expands the region of the negative dt .",

    "only the positive differential conductivity is plotted.,width=328 ]      finally , we address the influence of the ch self - energy on the emergence of the negative dt ( positive differential conductivity ) . the total differential conductivity with the ch self - energy for graphene on sio@xmath64 substrate in the electron - temperature  chemical - potential ( @xmath12-@xmath74 ) parameter spaces is plotted in fig .  [ figsw3](a ) .",
    "here , the probe - photon energy @xmath0 is chosen to be 1500  mev . comparing with the results without the ch self - energy [ fig .",
    "[ figsw2](e ) ] , one finds that the ch self - energy enhances both the region and the magnitude of the positive differential conductivity markedly .",
    "this means that the variation of the ch self - energy after the pumping is the dominant mechanism leading to the positive differential conductivity at such high @xmath0 if it is taken into consideration .",
    "it is worth noting that , the shape for the region of the positive differential conductivity with the ch self - energy is similar to the one without it [ fig .",
    "[ figsw2](e ) ] ( this is also true for @xmath0-@xmath74 parameter space ) .",
    "this means that the tendency for the emergence of the total differential conductivity summarized in sec .",
    "iiib is still valid , although the variation of the ch self - energy after the pumping becomes the dominant mechanism leading to the positive differential conductivity .",
    "it is noted that since the ch self - energy mainly comes from the variation of the screening , its influence should be smaller if the graphene layer is on a substrate with higher background dielectric consistent . to confirm this",
    ", we show the results for graphene on sic [ fig .",
    "[ figsw3](b ) ] , whose background dielectric constant is 2.2 times of that for sio@xmath64 .",
    "one finds that both the magnitude and the region of the positive differential conductivity decrease obviously compared with the one on sio@xmath64 substrate . nevertheless , the positive differential conductivity ( negative dt ) region shown on sic substrate is still very large .",
    "actually , the negative dt region shown on sio@xmath64 and sic substrates with the ch self - energy is so large that it disagrees with some of the existing experiments.@xcite dawlaty _",
    "et al._@xcite have shown experimentally for graphene on sic substrate that the dt is positive when the optical excited electron density is about @xmath124  @xmath63 with the corresponding @xmath12 estimated to be around 900  k and @xmath74 around zero under the probe - photon energy close to 1500  mev.@xcite however , the numerically obtained dt with these parameters is negative as shown in fig .",
    "[ figsw3](b ) .",
    "moreover , ruzicka _",
    "et al._@xcite and brida _",
    "et al._@xcite also showed in graphene on sio@xmath64 substrate that the dt is positive when the excited electron density is about @xmath125  @xmath63 with the corresponding @xmath12 estimated to be around 1000  k and @xmath74 around @xmath126  mev.@xcite however , the numerically obtained dt with the ch self - energy is also negative as shown in fig .",
    "[ figsw3](a ) .",
    "nevertheless , for the case without the ch self - energy , the dts under these parameters are all positive [ fig .",
    "[ figsw2](e ) for the sio@xmath64 substrate and that for the sic substrate is not shown ] .",
    "further considering the fact that the result obtained without the ch self - energy is consistent with the experiment with the negative dt ( sec .",
    "iiib),@xcite one concludes that although the calculation of the ch self - energy used here is very successful in semiconductors,@xcite it overestimates the coulomb self - energy in the gapless graphene system .",
    "this may come from the approximations used to obtain eq .",
    "( [ chselfenergy ] ) .",
    "for example , the background dielectric constant @xmath41 is taken to be constant although it is shown to increase with @xmath127 [ ref .  ] and the vertex correction@xcite for the coulomb screening is neglected .",
    "a better description on the influence of the coulomb self - energy is beyond the scope of this investigation .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the emergence of the negative dt by calculating the optical conductivity based on the linear response theory with the keldysh green function approach . in our calculation",
    ", the influences of the electron - phonon and electron - impurity scatterings as well as the coulomb self - energy are explicitly included .",
    "we investigate the system with the photo - excited electron density much larger than the equilibrium one and show that the negative dt ( or equivalently , the positive differential conductivity ) can appear at low probe - photon energy @xmath0 ( in the order of the scattering rate ) or at high @xmath0 ( much larger than the scattering rate ) .    for the low @xmath0 case ,",
    "the negative dt is shown to mainly come from the large increase of the intra - band conductivity due to the large variation of the electron distribution after the pumping .",
    "as for the high @xmath0 case , it is shown that the inter - band conductivity with only scattering can lead to the negative dt when the hot - electron temperature @xmath12 is close to the equilibrium one and the chemical potential @xmath74 is higher than the equilibrium chemical potential but considerably lower than @xmath13 . moreover",
    ", the intra - band conductivity can further expand this region of the negative dt because it always tends to decrease dt if @xmath12 and @xmath74 increase after the pumping .",
    "furthermore , in the temperature range usually estimated in the experiments ( around 1000  k ) , the hf self - energy is also shown to be able to contribute to the negative dt by increasing the inter - band differential conductivity considerably when @xmath74 is much higher than the equilibrium one .",
    "this further expands the region of the negative dt at high @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , the hf self - energy has little influence on the intra - band conductivity and hence its effect on the negative dt at low @xmath0 can be neglected .",
    "in addition , we also show that if the phonon temperature is smaller than that of electrons , the inter - band differential conductivity is increased which also expands the region of the negative dt .",
    "our numerical results are consistent with the @xmath0 dependence of the negative dt obtained experimentally by shang _",
    "et al._.@xcite    the influence of the ch self - energy is also investigated .",
    "we find that it markedly expands the region of the negative dt .",
    "however , this expansion is too large which makes the obtained region of the negative dt become incompatible with the existing experiments.@xcite this means that the ch self - energy calculated with the well established approach in semiconductors@xcite overestimates the coulomb self - energy in the gapless graphene system .",
