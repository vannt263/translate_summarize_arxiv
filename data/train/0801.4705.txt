    "obviously , such a spatial persistence probability should be defined as the probability that a _ line _ of sites extending from the origin to site @xmath203 next to an active seed is found to be inactive .",
    "the problem of spatial persistence was first introduced and analyzed by majumdar and bray in the context of fluctuating interfaces  @xcite .        as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spatialdemo ] spatial persistence in dp is most easily introduced in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "part  ( a ) of the figure shows the one - sided version of ordinary temporal persistence : starting with an initial state where all sites to the right of the origin are occupied , the one - sided persistence probability @xmath204 is the probability that no path from the horizontal line of initially occupied sites reaches the vertical line at the origin extending up to time @xmath1 .",
    "this probability is known to decay as @xmath205 , where @xmath12 is the local persistence exponent .",
    "part ( b ) shows the same arrangement rotated by @xmath206 : here we ask for the probability @xmath207 that there is no path from a vertical line at the origin @xmath208 to the finite horizontal line extending from the origin to site @xmath203 .",
    "more specifically , we keep the site at the origin active and let the system evolve . once it reaches a stationary state we ask for the probability that the sites @xmath209 are inactive . obviously , this quantity is a spatial analogue of temporal persistence .",
    "[ fig : spatialpers ] shows a numerical measurement of @xmath207 in the stationary state of a critical contact process with an active seed at the origin .",
    "we observe that the one - sided spatial persistence probability decays algebraically as @xmath210 this estimate is consistent with the scaling relation @xmath211 where @xmath212 is the dynamical exponent of dp .",
    "clearly , the two - sided spatial persistence probability that @xmath203 sites on both sides of the active seed are inactive will scale as @xmath213 .    in dimensions",
    "@xmath214 spatial persistence may be defined as the probability in a stationary dp process with an active seed at the origin that all sites in a @xmath5-dimensional sphere of radius @xmath203 surrounding the origin are inactive .",
    "in this work we have analyzed in detail different aspects of local persistence in dp processes . concerning persistence in @xmath215 spatial dimensions",
    ", a simple mean field approach shows that the local persistence exponent @xmath12 is a non - universal quantity related to the amplitude of the density field , which generally depends on both dimensionality and model details .",
    "a similar non - universal behavior above the upper critical dimension was previously observed in other reaction diffusion models as well  @xcite .    below the upper critical dimension ,",
    "we have performed high precision numerical simulations in order to improve current estimates of @xmath12 in one spatial dimension . on this basis",
    "we can safely exclude the conjecture @xmath216 , i.e. , the local persistence exponent  like other dp critical exponents  is seemingly not given by a simple rational value .",
    "the simulations in @xmath217 spatial dimensions are less conclusive , apparently due to huge transient effects , which make it impossible to estimate the value of @xmath12 by numerical simulations . however , specifying lower bounds we can at least rule out a possible _ superuniversality _ between @xmath85 and @xmath218 mentioned in @xcite .",
    "although we have not been able to determine @xmath12 in @xmath219 , or even to prove the existence of an asymptotic power law behavior analytically , we have discussed various concepts  scaling relations , graded persistence , mapping to active seed problems and spatial persistence  which we hope could prove useful for further theoretical and numerical advances .    finally , let us add a comment on our results concerning local persistence in seed simulations . numerical results exhibit a clean power - law in the one - dimensional case , whereas in higher dimensions we observe systematic deviations from a power - law behavior within the numerically accessible range of time .",
    "it is not clear whether these deviations just resemble a longer - lasting transient period .",
    "they could also be related to a qualitative difference between the one - dimensional and the higher - dimensional cases , or more precisely to a kind of special screening effect in one dimension : in one dimensional seed simulations the persistence of the lattice site at the origin is not influenced by remote branches of the emerging cluster , because these are shielded by the branches next to the origin ( left and right ) , as long as those have not died out .",
    "if a remote branch approaches the origin , it will merge with the inner branches without changing their dynamics ( this is particularly easy to see in 1 + 1-dimensional directed bond percolation ) . in other words , a return of the seed to the origin can only be accomplished from one of the two branches next to the origin . in higher dimensions",
    ", there is no such shielding effect .",
    "take for example the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional case : the initial seed develops into a cone - like cluster , and the origin could be reached from any direction in the plane of the lattice , not only from the nearest branches .",
    "so , with the breakdown of the shielding effect , a return to the origin is more likely , which leads to a stronger , perhaps even non - algebraic decline of local persistence .",
