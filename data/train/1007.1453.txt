    "deep multiwavelength surveys have greatly refined our understanding of the cosmic star - formation and mass - assembly history . measurements of galaxy luminosity functions at multiple wavelengths have provided a reasonably tight constraint on the evolution of the space density of the galaxy star - formation rate ( sfr ) : the cosmic star formation history is known to within up to redshifts of and within a factor of at ( e.g. , hopkins 2004 ) .",
    "it has been established that the galaxy sfr density has a broad maximum at , followed by a sharp drop from to ( e.g. , dickinson et al .",
    "2003a ; giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) and a fast decrease beyond ( see , e.g. , hopkins & beacom 2006 ; wilkins et al .",
    "it now seems clear that the bulk of present stellar mass was formed over a critical epoch at ( e.g. , hopkins & beacom 2006 ) .",
    "star - formation and active galactic nucleus ( i.e. , agn ) activity in galaxies are often found to go hand - in - hand ( e.g. , page et al .",
    "2001 ; alexander et al . 2005b ;",
    "netzer et al .",
    "2007 ; silverman et al . 2009 ) . both agn activity and star formation peak in about the same redshift range ( ) ,",
    "and they undergo a similar decline below ( e.g. , cowie et al .",
    "2003 ; merloni et al .",
    "2004 ; silverman et al .",
    "mounting evidence has shown that supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) centered in galaxies must play an important role in galaxy evolution .",
    "the close connection between agns and their hosts is most strikingly shown by the tight correlations between the masses of smbhs and the properties of their host - galaxy bulges ( e.g. , hring & rix 2004 ; ferrarese & ford 2005 ; gltekin et al .",
    "recent theoretical models propose that agn feedback is an important ingredient in understanding the interconnection between agns and their hosts ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ; di matteo et al .",

    "two main agn feedback modes are thought to be significant . in the `` radiative mode '' ,",
    "the initially shrouded luminous agn expels the obscuring gas ( that feeds both the smbh and star formation ) and thus quenches star formation ( e.g. , hopkins et al . 2005 ; springel et al .",
    "the `` kinetic mode '' invokes agn heating to prevent hot gas from cooling and falling into a galaxy to form stars ( e.g. , croton et al .",
    "2006 ) , which is generally thought to be important in the more massive halos and occurs at much smaller accretion rates than that of the radiative - mode feedback . to investigate the close connections between star formation and agn activity and",
    "thus fully understand galaxy formation and evolution , a sensible approach is to study both agns and their hosts .",
    "galaxy colors are directly related to the star - formation , dust , and metal - enrichment history of galaxies and thus provide important constraints for models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ; plot of rest - frame @xmath0/@xmath1 colors vs. @xmath2-band/@xmath3-band absolute magnitudes ) has proven to be one effective tool for exploring the role of agns in galaxy evolution .",
    "previous cmd studies have obtained a number of results , e.g. : ( 1 ) the galaxy color bimodality ( i.e. , separation of galaxies into the red sequence and the blue cloud ) has been clearly seen in the cmd , while no color bimodality of agn hosts appears to exist ( e.g. , bhm & wisotzki 2007 ; nandra et al . 2007 ; silverman et al .",
    "( 2 ) the clustering of agns in the cmd is distinct .",
    "it has been shown that /optically - selected agns reside in the red sequence , the top of the blue cloud , and the green valley in between ( e.g. , martin et al .",
    "2007 ; nandra et al . 2007 ; rovilos & georgantopoulos 2007 ; westoby et al .",
    "2007 ) ; it has also been found that radio agns preferentially lie on the red sequence , agns lie in the green valley , and ir - selected agns are found in somewhat bluer hosts than agns ( hickox et al .",
    "( 3 ) the broad distribution of host - galaxy colors of selected moderate - luminosity agns is dependent on the strong color evolution of luminous ( ) galaxies and the influence of enhanced agn activity in mpc large - scale structures ( silverman et al .",
    "( 4 ) morphologies of selected moderate - luminosity agns reveal no close connection between major mergers and agn activity , and are consistent with minor interactions and/or secular evolution ( e.g. , grogin et al . 2005 ; georgakakis et al .",
    "2008 ; silverman et al .",
    "( 5 ) agns preferentially reside in luminous bulges ( e.g. , nandra et al . 2007 ;",
    "silverman et al .",
    "however , we note that these cmd results are limited to redshifts below and relatively bright sources ( usually ) , primarily due to data - depth limitations .",
    "a natural follow - up question is what further insights can be gained by extending cmd studies through the galaxy formation epoch when star - formation and agn activity peaked ?    as data from exceptionally deep multiwavelength surveys have become available in the deep fields ( see brandt & hasinger 2005 and brandt & alexander 2010 for reviews of deep extragalactic surveys ) , it is now feasible to push cmd studies to higher redshifts . in this paper",
    ", we aim to assess the role of agns in galaxy evolution by means of cmd analyses through the galaxy formation epoch , using the cdf surveys ( e.g. , alexander et al . 2003 ; luo et al . 2008 ) as well as superb complementary ultradeep multiwavelength data .",
    "a key aspect of this paper is the use of reliable stellar masses and the assessment of possible stellar - mass selection effects , because stellar mass is likely the most fundamental observable parameter for understanding the properties of galaxies and there are suggestions of stellar - mass biases in cmd works ( e.g. , silverman et al . 2009 ) .",

    "again , we adopted the aperture - corrected photometry for analysis .",
    "two cross - matching methods were used : closest - counterpart matching and likelihood - ratio matching .",
    "closest - counterpart matching , as the name suggests , simply assigns the closest angular match as the counterpart ( given some maximum matching radius ) ; the separation between two sources is the sole criterion for this method ( so it is easily implemented and executes quickly ) .",

    "we also find , if considering star - forming populations only [ i.e. , applying a cut of @xmath142 ( @xmath143 , @xmath144 ) @xmath55 yr@xmath5 to both agn hosts and non - agn galaxies at @xmath145 ( @xmath146 , @xmath147 ) ] , that both agn hosts and non - agn galaxies have similar sfr distributions irregardless of redshift range considered .",
    "this result may contribute to explaining the interesting trend we mentioned above that the factor of difference between the sfrs of agn hosts and non - agn galaxies diminishes above @xmath148 .",
    "the majority of agn hosts / non - agn galaxies at @xmath149 have a sfr greater than , which means that their sfr distributions are dominated by star - forming populations ( thus being similar ) .",
    "further investigation is required to understand the physical origin of agn hosts having higher sfrs than non - agn galaxies at low redshifts vs. agn hosts and non - agn galaxies having similar sfrs at high redshifts .",
    "there might appear to be an inconsistency between the two results obtained with mass - matched samples at @xmath52 that agn hosts have higher sfrs than non - agn galaxies and that the color distributions of agn hosts and non - agn galaxies are similar , since the former result suggests that agn hosts should have bluer colors than non - agn galaxies .",
    "however , as shown in ",
    "[ color - dep ] , the correlation between colors and sfrs is not very tight : for a given color , the sfrs span a wide range , although there may be a rough trend of bluer colors toward higher sfrs .",
    "furthermore , the sfrs of agn hosts are roughly a factor of larger than the sfrs of non - agn galaxies at @xmath52 , which does not make a strong difference in colors .",
    "therefore , there is no real inconsistency in this issue .",
    "in this work , we have assembled a sample of x - ray - selected moderate - luminosity agns as well as their parent galaxies in the most sensitive central areas of the cdfs to extend color - magnitude relations of agn hosts and non - agn galaxies through the galaxy formation epoch .",
    "the uniqueness of this sample allows us to explore several important issues up to when most of galaxy assembly occurred ; such explorations at high redshifts have been largely unattainable in previous studies primarily due to data - depth issues .",
    "the main advantages of this work are ( 1 ) we have used the deepest data , the best multiwavelength coverage , and spectroscopic / photometric redshifts of the highest quality to date ; and ( 2 ) we have used a template sed fitting method to derive galaxy physical properties ( e.g. , colors , stellar masses , and sfrs ) , which significantly reduces the failure rate of estimations for high - redshift sources whose seds are more prone to large uncertainties or errors . we summarize the main results of this work as follows :    1 .   non - agn galaxy color bimodality ( i.e. , existence of the red sequence and the blue cloud ) exists up to , with or without correcting for dust extinction",
    ". however , there appears to be no apparent color bimodality for agn hosts up to .",
    "these results ( see   [ sec : bi ] ) confirm previous works and extend them to higher redshifts .",
    "2 .   for mass - matched samples up to ( e.g. , ): ( 1 ) both agn hosts and non - agn galaxies",
    "are luminous and share similar @xmath23 distributions ; ( 2 ) agn clustering in the cmd is not apparent ; and ( 3 ) the agn fraction remains nearly constant ( at ) regardless of color , which likely indicates the duty cycle of smbh growth in typical massive galaxies ( see   [ sec : cmd ]    [ mass - effect ] ) .",
    "these results are in contrast to those obtained with non - mass - matched samples up to ( e.g. , ): ( 1 ) agn hosts generally appear more luminous ( i.e. , having more negative values of @xmath23 ) than non - agn galaxies ; ( 2 ) agns predominantly reside in the red sequence , the top of the blue cloud , and the green valley in between ( i.e. , agn clustering in the cmd ) ; and ( 3 ) the agn fraction generally increases as the color becomes redder ( see   [ sec : cmd ] and   [ color - dep ] ) .",
    "luminous smgs , the prototypical examples of extreme star - forming galaxies at , are spread throughout the cmd ( see   [ sec : cmd ] ) .",
    "likely due to dust - extinction effects , they often do not show the blue colors typically associated with star - forming galaxies .",
    "this underscores the need for caution when studying the color - magnitude properties of small samples of remarkable sources .",
    "4 .   most agns reside in massive hosts ( i.e. , @xmath132 ) , and the agn fraction rises strongly toward higher stellar masses ( see   [ color - dep ] ) , up to , which confirms and extends previous works at lower redshifts .",
    "there are some strong trends of non - agn galaxy / agn host rest - frame colors , up to ( see   [ color - dep ] ) : ( 1 ) the colors of both non - agn galaxies and agn hosts generally become bluer as the redshift increases ; and ( 2 ) the colors of both non - agn galaxies and agn hosts generally become redder as the stellar mass increases .",
    "6 .   for mass - matched samples ,",
    "the sfrs of agn hosts are on average a factor of larger than those of non - agn galaxies at , but this difference diminishes at ( see   [ mass - effect ] ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated that galaxy evolution is best probed using stellar - mass selected samples ( e.g. , van dokkum et al .",
    "2006 ; kriek et al .",
    "2008 ; and references therein ) .",
    "van dokkum et al . (",
    "2006 ) recommend that samples of high - redshift galaxies be selected by stellar mass , rather than by color or luminosity , because ( 1 ) the mass evolution of galaxies is probably gradual , whereas luminosities and colors can vary dramatically on short timescales due to starbursts and dust , and ( 2 ) models of galaxy formation can predict masses with higher confidence than luminosities and colors .",
    "moreover , stellar - mass selected samples make comparisons between the properties of agn hosts and non - agn galaxies more appropriate . for example",
    ", silverman et al . (",
    "2009 ) showed that a mass - selected sample is required to reduce the strength of an artificial peak in the agn fraction falling in the transition region ( i.e. , the green valley ) due to the fact that many blue - cloud galaxies have low mass - to - light ratios in luminosity limited samples .    in this work",
    ", we have further demonstrated the importance of using mass - matched samples for investigations of color - magnitude relations of active and non - active galaxies , because results and conclusions obtained with a mass - matched sample are different from those obtained with a non - mass - matched sample ( see   [ sec : cmd ]    [ mass - effect ] ) .",
    "for instance , for a non - mass - matched sample , agns predominantly reside in the red sequence , the top of the blue cloud , and the green valley in between ; this has been presented as evidence for agn feedback because the location of agn hosts in the cmd is consistent with the transitional region where the blue - to - red migration of galaxies occurs due to the quenching of star formation ( e.g. , nandra et al . 2007 ) .",
    "however , the agn clustering in the cmd largely disappears and the agn fraction remains nearly constant as a function of color when considering a mass - matched sample .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain a complete picture about the role of agns in galaxy evolution by means of cmd analyses , one must fully take into account the dependence of agn activity on stellar mass ( i.e. , using mass - matched samples ) .    with mass - selection effects taken into account , we find that the main results in this work ( except for color - bimodality , which likely needs some quenching mechanism ) can be reasonably explained by a combination of two main ingredients : ( 1 ) agns at preferentially reside in massive galaxies that generally tend to have redder colors ( i.e. , color - mass correlation ) ; and ( 2 ) galaxies evolve passively ( e.g. , kodama & arimoto 1997 ; stanford , eisenhardt , & dickinson 1998 ; van dokkum & franx 2001 ; daddi et al . 2004 ; bothwell , kennicutt , & lee 2009 ) or secularly ( e.g. , kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ; hopkins & hernquist 2006 ) ; this ingredient is mainly responsible for the evolution of galaxies , i.e. , blue - to - red migration .",
    "consequently , our results tightly constrain any effects from moderate - luminosity agn feedback upon the color - magnitude properties of galaxies from when most of galaxy assembly occurred .",
    "we note that moderate - luminosity agns , like those studied here , dominate the accretion density and smbh growth only at while more luminous agns dominate above @xmath148 ( e.g. , ueda et al . 2003 ; hasinger , miyaji , & schmidt 2005 ) . for moderate - luminosity agns ,",
    "some simulations predict that feedback may not be important ( e.g. , hopkins & hernquist 2006 ) , whereas other models suggest it is ( e.g. , fabian , vasudevan , & gandhi 2008 ; raimundo et al .",
    "given that such simulations and models generally rely on significant assumptions and are therefore subject to large uncertainties , further observational tests of moderate - luminosity agn feedback are required .",
    "we show that the agn fraction is approximately constant across colors for galaxies with similar stellar masses and that agns with blue and red hosts have comparable luminosities ( see   [ mass - effect ] ) .",
    "these results imply that agn activity is about as prevalent in massive blue galaxies as it is in red galaxies . assuming that the smbh mass generally decreases toward blue colors since the bulges may be smaller in blue ( late - type ) hosts than in red ( early - type ) hosts for a given galaxy stellar mass , the less - massive smbhs in blue hosts may undergo more significant fractional growth ( i.e. , with larger eddington ratios ) than those in red hosts .",
    "if this effect exists and is significant , agn feedback may be more likely to occur in those systems having higher ratios of @xmath150 .",
    "however , the above assumption is not certain .",
    "for example , schawinski et al .",
    "( 2010 ) show that in local universe there is no simple relationship between colors and morphological types [ e.g. , a red ( blue ) galaxy is not necessarily an early - type ( late - type ) galaxy and vice versa ] ; they also show that both early- and late - type agn hosts have similar typical smbh masses and eddington ratios ( although both smbh masses and eddington ratios span a broad range ) . at high redshifts , it is more challenging to obtain reliable morphological information and estimates of smbh masses .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to assess how significant agn feedback effects could be in some massive blue galaxies if such feedback even exists at , given the current constraints .",
    "further investigation of these effects would be worthwhile .",
    "a great deal of further work , in addition to that already mentioned , can be done to improve and extend the analyses presented here , e.g. , obtaining even deeper and near - infrared data . according to fig .",
    "[ lum - z](a ) , we would expect to identify an agn with @xmath151 out to @xmath59 , but we would not expect to identify an agn with @xmath31 a few times @xmath152 beyond @xmath57 . we note that this is already the best that the currently deepest surveys , the cdfs , can offer .",
    "therefore , data with even higher sensitivity are required to provide better completeness , which will also increase the size of the agn sample by detecting more highly obscured and moderate - luminosity agns at high redshifts . obtaining ultradeep near - infrared data",
    "would also be beneficial for the analyses here .",
    "first , ultradeep near - infrared selected source catalogs would include a population of less - massive red galaxies and thus lower the stellar - mass completeness limit .",
    "second , ultradeep near - infrared data have proved critical to improve @xmath153 estimates and thus estimates of other source properties , especially for high-@xmath79 sources , e.g. , wardlow et al .",
    "( 2010 ) made use of ultradeep @xmath37 and @xmath12 data as well as other multiwavelength data to derive high - quality photometric redshifts for a sample of smgs .",
    "another valuable project within the framework of color - magnitude and color - mass relations , as an extension of our work here , would be to constrain the colors of quasar hosts out to high redshifts , although practically this is difficult because the host light is overwhelmed by quasar emission except for highly obscured quasars .",

    "<S> we extend color - magnitude relations for moderate - luminosity x - ray agn hosts and non - agn galaxies through the galaxy formation epoch ( ) in the _ chandra _ deep field - north and _ chandra _ deep field - south ( and , respectively ; jointly cdfs ) surveys . </S>",
    "<S> this study was enabled by the deepest available x - ray data from the cdf surveys as well as complementary ultradeep multiwavelength data in these regions . </S>",
    "<S> we utilized analyses of color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) to assess the role of moderate - luminosity agns in galaxy evolution . </S>",
    "<S> first , we confirm some previous results and extend them to higher redshifts , finding , for example , that ( 1 ) there is no apparent color bimodality ( i.e. , the lack of an obvious red sequence and blue cloud ) for agn hosts from , but non - agn galaxy color bimodality exists up to and the relative fraction of red - sequence galaxies generally increases as the redshift decreases ( consistent with a blue - to - red migration of galaxies ) ; ( 2 ) most agns reside in massive hosts and the agn fraction rises strongly toward higher stellar mass , up to ; and ( 3 ) the colors of both agn hosts and non - agn galaxies become redder as the stellar mass increases , up to . </S>",
    "<S> second , we point out that , in order to obtain a complete and reliable picture , it is critical to use mass - matched samples to examine color - magnitude relations of agn hosts and non - agn galaxies . we show that for mass - matched samples up to , agn hosts lie in the same region of the cmd as non - agn galaxies ; i.e. , there is no specific clustering of agn hosts in the cmd around the red sequence , the top of the blue cloud , or the green valley in between . </S>",
    "<S> the agn fraction ( ) is mostly independent of host - galaxy color , providing an indication of the duty cycle of supermassive black hole growth in typical massive galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these results are in contrast to those obtained with non - mass - matched samples where there is apparent agn clustering in the cmd and the agn fraction generally increases as the color becomes redder . </S>",
    "<S> we also find , for mass - matched samples , that the star - formation rates of agn hosts are typically a factor of larger than those of non - agn galaxies at , whereas this difference diminishes at . with mass - selection effects taken into account </S>",
    "<S> , we find that almost all the results obtained in this work can be reasonably explained by two main ingredients , color - mass correlation ( i.e. , x - ray agns preferentially reside in massive galaxies that generally tend to be redder than less - massive galaxies ) and passive or secular evolution of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the presence of moderate - luminosity agn activity does not have a significant effect on the colors of galaxies and thus tightly constrain any effects from moderate - luminosity agn feedback upon color - magnitude properties over the of cosmic time during which most of galaxy formation occurred .     _ </S>"
