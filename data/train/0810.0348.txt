    "recently , spitzer irs ( infra - red spectrometer ) observations led to the unexpected detection of extremely bright mid - ir ( @xmath1erg  s@xmath2 ) @xmath0 rotational line emission from warm gas towards the group - wide shock in stephan s quintet ( hereafter sq ) ( appleton et al . 2006 ) .",
    "this first result was quickly followed by the detection of bright @xmath0 line emission from more distant galaxies ( egami et al .",

    "these @xmath0-bright galaxies may represent an important signature of galaxy evolution , but this unusual emission accompanied by little ( or no ) star formation has not yet been explained . because of the absence or relative weakness of star forming signatures ( dust features , ionized gas lines ) in the mid - infrared spitzer spectra , their exceptional h@xmath3 luminosity may trace a _",

    "the same properties of the h@xmath4 emission are observed in different types of objects that characterize key - processes at work in galaxy formation and evolution : gas accretion , galaxy interactions , gas ejection due to star formation or to the action of the central black hole on its environment . in each case",
    ", h@xmath4 lines appear to have an unexpected contribution to the gas cooling .",

    "evidence for a galaxy - wide shock comes from observations of x - rays from the hot post - shock gas ( trinchieri et al . 1003 , 2005 ) , strong radio synchrotron emission from the radio emitting plasma ( sulentic et al . 2001 ) and",
    "shocked - gas excitation diagnostics from optical emission lines ( xu et al . 2003 ) .",

    "the main energy reservoir is the bulk kinetic energy of the gas . a minor fraction of the collision energy is used to heat the hot plasma .",
    "the @xmath0 surface brightness is larger than the x - ray emission from the same region , thus the @xmath0 line emission dominates over x - ray cooling in the center of the shock . as such , it plays a major role in the energy dissipation and evolution of the post - shock gas .     observations .",

    "width=287 ]    [ figure2 ]    we propose a scenario where a large - scale shock wave overtakes an inhomogeneous pre - shock medium ( guillard et al . 2008 , submitted ) .",
    "the collision speed is the shock speed in the low density volume filling gas . the post - shock pressure of the hot gas drives slower shocks into denser gas . the post - shock gas is thus heated to a range of temperatures that depend on the pre - shock gas density .",
    "our model quantifies the gas cooling , dust destruction , h@xmath4 formation and excitation in the post - shock medium ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "schematically , the low density volume filling pre - shock gas , shocked at high velocities ( @xmath12 km  s@xmath2 ) becomes a dust - free x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "the cooling timescale of the hot gas is more than one order of magnitude greater than the shock age ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "therefore the post - shock plasma does not have the time to cool down and form molecular gas since the shock was initiated .",
    "denser gas is heated at lower temperatures and dust survives . in the context of the sq shock ,",
    "we show that these clouds have time to cool down and form h@xmath4 before being disrupted .",
    "we show that the  cooling of the hii or hi gas can not explain the observed h@xmath4 emission , but that low - velocity ( @xmath14  km  s@xmath2 ) shocks driven into molecular fragments can account for it .",
    "we propose that these shocks are generated by cloud fragments collisions .",
    "the supersonic turbulence in the molecular fragments is powered by a slow energy and momentum transfer from the bulk motion of the gas .",
    "the turbulent energy of the post - shock gas drives a mass cycle across the different gas phases where h@xmath4 is forming out of the hot gas .",
    "in this section , we place the spitzer @xmath0 detection in the broader context set by optical observations . we propose a picture of the post - shock gas evolution that sketches the dynamical interaction between gas phases .",
    "this interpretation introduces a physical framework that may apply to h@xmath3 luminous galaxies in general .    a schematic cartoon of the evolutionary picture of the post - shock gas which arises from our data interpretation is presented in fig .",
    "3 . it sketches a global view that we detail here .",
    "black and red arrows represent the mass flows between the h  ii , warm h  i , warm and cold h@xmath3 gas components of the post - shock gas .",
    "the large arrow to the left symbolizes the relative motion between the warm and cold gas and the surrounding plasma .",
    "each of the black arrows is labeled with its main associated process : gas recombination and ionization ( arrow number 1 ) , h@xmath3 formation ( 2 ) and h@xmath3 cooling ( 3 ) .",
    "the values of the mass flows and the associated timescales are derived from observations and our model calculations ( see guillard et al .",
    "2008 for details ) .",
    "a continuous cycle through gas components is excluded by the increasing mass flow needed to account for the @xmath11 , oi , and @xmath0 luminosities .",
    "heating of the cold h@xmath3 gas towards warmer gas states ( red arrows ) needs to occur .",
    "it is the dissipation of the gas mechanical energy that powers these red arrows .",
    "the post - shock molecular cloud fragments are likely to experience a distribution of shock velocities , depending on their size and density .",
    "arrow number 4 represents the low velocity magnetic shocks excitation of h@xmath3 gas that can account for the h@xmath3 emission ( described in guillard et al . ) .",
    "more energetic shocks may dissociate the molecular gas ( arrows number 5 ) .",
    "they are necessary to account for the low h@xmath15 to o  i luminosity ratio .",
    "even more energetic shocks may ionize the molecular gas ( arrow number 6 ) .",
    "this would bring cold @xmath0 directly into the h  ii reservoir .",
    "turbulent mixing of hot , warm and cold gas are an alternative mass input of h  ii gas .",
    "turbulent mixing layers result from cloud gas shredding into fragments that become too small to survive evaporation due to heat conduction ( see e.g. begelman & fabian , 1990 ) .",
    "turbulent mixing is represented by the thin blue arrow towards the surrouding plasma , to the left of our cartoon .",
    "turbulent mixing produces intermediate temperature gas that is thermally instable .",
    "this gas cools back to produce h  ii gas that enters the cycle ( thin red arrow ) .",
    "it is relevant to our scenario to note that cold gas in mixing layers probably preserves its dust content .",
    "it is only heated to a few @xmath16k , well below temperatures for which thermal sputtering becomes effective .",
    "further , metals from the dust - free hot plasma that is brought to cool are expected to accrete on dust when gas cools and condenses .",
    "our understanding of the dynamical interaction between gas phase is inspired by numerical simulations ( e.g. audit & hennebelle 2005 ) which have changed our perspective on the interstellar medium phases from a static to a dynamical picture .",
    "the interaction with the hot plasma supplies mechanical energy and momentum to the warm gas as discussed in the context of cold gas observations in clusters by pope et al .",
    "2008 . in our interpretation",
    "it is this energy input which drives turbulence and the gas cycle .    many galaxy collisions and mergers",
    "are observed to trigger ir - luminous bursts of star formation .",
    "however , the absence of spectroscopic signatures of photoionization ( dust or ionized gas lines ) in the center of the sq shock ( xu et al .",
    "2003 ) show no or little star formation in this region .",
    "our interpretation is that the bulk kinetic energy of the gas colliding flows is not completely dissipated . within this dynamical understanding of the post - shock gas , cold",
    "molecular is not a mass sink .",
    "the fact that there is no star formation at the centre of the shock shows that it is not long - lived enough to allow formation of gravitationally instable molecular fragments . within a more general framework , interacting",
    "h@xmath3 luminous galaxies may represent an intermediate phase in the evolution of mergers , prior to the starburst .",
