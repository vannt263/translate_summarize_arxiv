    "a striking feature of heavy ion collisions is the huge stopping of the participating nucleons . at cern energies , the deep minimum in the net baryon rapidity distribution ( @xmath4 ) at @xmath5 , observed in @xmath6 collisions , has been practically filled up in a central collision of heavy ions @xcite . for central @xmath7-@xmath7 collisions ,",
    "the value of this density is five times larger than the corresponding value in @xmath6  scaled by the average number of participants .",
    "note that the total number of @xmath8 ( i.e. integrated over rapidity ) , exactly satisfies scaling in the number of participants , due to baryon number conservation .",
    "this shows the dramatic change in the shape of the @xmath8 ( and @xmath9 ) rapidity distributions between @xmath6 and central @xmath7-@xmath7 collisions .",
    "such a change is usually referred to as baryon stopping .",
    "all independent string models of hadronic and nuclear collisions in their original form completely fail to reproduce this important feature of heavy ion collisions . in the dual parton model ( dpm )",
    "@xcite and in the quark gluon string model ( qgsm ) @xcite , the dominant contribution to particle production in @xmath6 collisions at @xmath10  gev , consists in two @xmath11-@xmath12 strings , which produce , after fragmentation , two baryons in the fragmentation regions of the colliding protons . starting with the lund model , which initially had a single string , the above mechanism of particle production has been adopted in most current string models . in these models , there is some amount of stopping due to energy conservation .",
    "this produces an increase of the net baryon yield at mid rapidities between nn and central @xmath7-@xmath7 collisions , which is typically of a factor 2 @xcite  more than two times smaller than the observed one .",
    "hence , the dramatic failure of all these models to reproduce the observed stopping .",
    "actually , a possibility to slow down the net baryon in @xmath6 collisions , was introduced a long time ago by rossi and veneziano @xcite . in their approach",
    ", the baryon is viewed as three valence quarks bound together by three strings each one with a quark at one end and with the other end joining in a point called string junction .",
    "this string junction carries momentum as well as the baryon quantum number .",
    "rossi and veneziano pointed out that the string junction could migrate to mid rapidities with a distribution in @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 .",
    "this corresponds to an annihilation cross - section which decreases with energy like @xmath15 . in refs . @xcite and @xcite a distribution of the string junction in @xmath16 ( i.e. flat in rapidity )",
    "was proposed , corresponding to an annihilation cross - section which reaches a constant asymptotic value ( of 1 to 2  mb ) .",
    "here we adopt the first approach .",
    "however , we do not rule out the second possibility  which would have important consequences at the energies of the future heavy ion colliders @xcite .",
    "the above stopping mechanism has been recently introduced in heavy ion collisions @xcite @xcite and implemented in the hijing @xcite and venus @xcite monte carlos .",
    "however , the introduction of the rossi - veneziano mechanism does not explain by itself why the stopping is larger in central heavy ion collisions than in @xmath6 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a mechanism to enhance stopping in heavy ion collisions was proposed .",
    "it was based on the separation of the @xmath6 cross - section @xmath17 into a diquark breaking ( @xmath18 ) and a diquark preserving ( @xmath19 ) piece , and on the assumption that the diquark can be broken in any inelastic collision . these results in a @xmath18 cross section in @xmath20 and @xmath21 collisions which increases faster with @xmath22 than the @xmath19 one .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that it requires some fine tuning .",
    "the value of @xmath23 has to be small enough in order not to contradict the @xmath6 and @xmath20 data ( where stopping is comparatively small ) and large enough to produce the large stopping observed in central heavy ion collisions .    in a recent publication @xcite",
    ", a new formulation of the @xmath18 mechanism has been introduced in which this drawback is avoided ( i.e. one can have @xmath23 negligeably small at cern energies , and still have an important effect in central @xmath7-@xmath7 collisions ) . in the present paper",
    "we use the formulation of @xcite to compute the rapidity distributions of @xmath8 in hadronic and nuclear collisions .",
    "we obtain a reasonable agreement with experiment mechanism of fig .  2 .",
    "another striking feature of the cern heavy ion program is the strong increase of the yields of hyperons and anti - hyperons per participant between @xmath6 or @xmath20 and central @xmath24 collisions .",
    "this increase obeys to the hierarchy @xmath25 ( i.e. the large number of strange quarks in @xmath26 , the larger the increase ) @xcite .",
    "in two recent publications @xcite @xcite , it has been shown that a baryon stopping mechanism of the type described above produces a substantial increase of the hyperon yields according to this hierarchy .",
    "the physical reason for this increase is quite obvious @xcite .",
    "since in the diquark breaking component the net baryon is formed out of three sea quarks around the string junction , the probability of producing hyperons is strongly enhanced  especially for @xmath2 s since its probability of production in the conventional diquark fragmentation mechanism is zero . in the present paper",
    "we extend the results of @xcite in two directions .",
    "first , we study the rapidity distributions of protons and hyperons in @xmath20 and @xmath21 collisions ( in refs . @xcite and @xcite the analysis",
    "was restricted to the rapidity window @xmath27 ) .",
    "second , we show how the four free parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite can actually be reduced to two .",
    "this makes the model more predictive , especially for the antihyperon over hyperon ratios .    while the yield of @xmath1 s and , to a large extent , of cascades can be described by the model , that of omegas is underestimated by almost an order of magnitude",
    "the same conclusion has been reached in @xcite .",
    "we show that final state interaction , with an averaged cross - section as small as @xmath3  mb @xcite , allows to describe all hyperon and antihyperon yields .",
    "a similar value of @xmath28 was found in ref .",
    "@xcite in the hadron gas model .",
    "it was argued there that , due to this small value of @xmath28 , interactions in a hadron gas could not drive the system to chemical equilibrium ( the process would be too slow ) .",
    "we find , indeed , that the effect of final state interaction in @xmath0 and @xmath1 production is very small .",
    "its effect on @xmath29 production is moderate . only for such a rare process as @xmath2 production its effect is very important  making the @xmath30 yield five times larger than the value obtained without final state interaction .    due to the diquark breaking component",
    ", we obtain an increase of hyperons substantially larger than the one of antihyperons , i.e. the ratio between @xmath7-@xmath7 and @xmath31 yields is substantially larger for @xmath26 than for @xmath32 .",
    "this effect is enhanced by final state interaction .",
    "it has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the baryon stopping mechanism and compute the net baryon ( @xmath8 ) rapidity distributions in @xmath6 , @xmath31 , @xmath33 and @xmath7-@xmath7 collisions . in section 3",
    "we compute the rapidity distributions of @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . in section 4",
    "we describe @xmath36 pair production from strings containing sea diquarks or antidiquarks at one of their ends and show how the @xmath22-dependence of @xmath37 production is increased . in section 5 we study the effect of the final state interaction , separately on the @xmath26 and @xmath32 yields .",
    "section 6 contains a discussion of our results .",
    "conclusions are given in section 7 .",
    "a fragmentation string mechanism in which the @xmath38 and @xmath39 behaviour of the fragmentation functions is controlled by regge intercepts has been introduced in ref . @xcite . in the case of net baryon production ,",
    "it consists of a sum of two terms as depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "in the original lund fragmentation scheme @xcite only the first term is considered .",
    "the second one was introduced later  the so - called pop - corn mechanism . even with the inclusion of the second component ( fig .",
    "1b ) , this mechanism leads to the production of too fast baryons and fails completely to reproduce the observed stopping in heavy ion collisions . this fragmentation scheme ( including the component in fig .",
    "1b ) will be referred to as the conventional or diquark preserving ( @xmath19 ) mechanism .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we introduce the baryon stopping mechanism showed in fig .",
    "it will be referred to as the diquark breaking ( @xmath18 ) component . in this component",
    ", the rapidity distribution of the produced net baryon @xmath4 in a @xmath40-@xmath40 collision is    [ 1e ] dn_db^b dy ( y ) = c_n_1,n_2    where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the average number of collisions suffered by the two colliding nucleons and @xmath44 is determined from the normalization to two .",
    "the factor @xmath45 has already been discussed in the introduction .",
    "the factor @xmath46 gives the behavior near @xmath47 .",
    "there is some uncertainty concerning its power @xcite .",
    "the value in eq .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) is obtained as follows . from fig .",
    "2 we see that in order to produce the baryon at @xmath48 it is necessary to slow down three quarks . assuming they behave as @xmath49 at the energies under consideration @xcite",
    ", we obtain a power @xmath50 for the case of fig . 2  which corresponds to @xmath51 . in the general case of @xmath52 inelastic collisions",
    "we obtain the power @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) .",
    "the corresponding distribution in @xmath21 collisions is @xcite    [ 2e ] dn^aab dy ( y ) = |n_a |n  .    here",
    "@xmath54 and @xmath55 are the average number of participants of nucleus @xmath22 and the average number of collisions , respectively .",
    "@xmath56 is given by the conventional , diquark preserving , hadronization mechanism for which we use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath57 is given by eq .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) .",
    "the integral over @xmath58 of both rapidity distributions is equal to two ( baryon number conservation ) .",
    "let us discuss the physical meaning of eq .",
    "( [ 2e ] ) in @xmath6 interactions ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "we see that in the case of a single inelastic collision ( @xmath60 ) , we recover the conventional @xmath19 mechanism .",
    "the underlying assumption is that , in this case , the string junction follows the valence diquark and baryon production takes place in the conventional way .",
    "( we do not exclude a small admixture of the @xmath18 component in this case , but experimental data do not require its presence ) .",
    "consider next the case of two inelastic collisions ( @xmath61 ) . here",
    "the underlying assumption is that there is an equal probability ( 1/2 ) for the net baryon to be produced in any of the two collisions .",
    "however , in only one of them can the string junction follow the valence diquark and fragment in the conventional ( @xmath19 ) way . in the other one ,",
    "the string junction is free and baryon production takes place according to the @xmath18 mechanism .",
    "the latter is responsible of ( most of ) the observed baryon stopping .",
    "the generalization to @xmath55 inelastic collisions and to @xmath21 interactions ( eq .",
    "( [ 2e ] ) ) is then straightforward .",
    "it is quite remarkable that such a simple mechanism , with no free parameter ( modulo the uncertainty in the power of @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) , discussed above ) gives a good description of the present data on the net baryon rapidity distribution .",
    "note that in the case of @xmath6 interactions at @xmath10  gev , the two string component @xmath63 dominates , and , as discussed above , we recover the usual @xmath19 results .",
    "with increasing energies , the components with @xmath64 become increasingly important and baryon stopping will increase .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) ( with @xmath59 ) not only gives definite predictions concerning this increase but , moreover , leads to specific qualitative features .",
    "in particular stopping will strongly depend on the charged particle multiplicity .",
    "a low multiplicity event sample selects low values of @xmath55 where stopping will be comparatively small , while , at large multiplicities , stopping will be larger .",
    "such a feature has been observed recently at hera @xcite  and discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in a different theoretical framework .",
    "we turn next to the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ 2e ] ) to asymmetric interactions such as @xmath20 . in this case one has    [ 3e ] dn^pa b dy(y ) & = & dn_dp^qq^a - q_v^p dy ( y ) + ( |n - 1 ) dn_dp^qq^a - q_s^p dy(y ) + + & + & 1 |n  .",
    "here @xmath65 denotes the rapidity distribution of a string stretched between a diquark of one of the @xmath55 wounded nucleons of @xmath22 and a valence ( or sea ) quark of the proton .",
    "( it is computed in dpm as a convolution of momentum distribution functions and fragmentation functions ) . since",
    "each of the wounded nucleons suffers a single inelastic collision , only the @xmath19 component is involved  with each diquark fragmenting in the nucleus fragmentation region @xmath66 .",
    "the terms in the bracket correspond to the fragmentation of the incoming proton .",
    "since it suffers @xmath55 inelastic collisions , we have the @xmath19 hadronization mechanism ( with probability @xmath67 ) and the @xmath18 one ( with probability @xmath68 ) . the latter is now given by the first term of eq .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) .",
    "all rapidity distributions , integrated over @xmath58 , are equal to one in this case .",
    "the @xmath8 rapidity distributions obtained from eq .",
    "( [ 2e ] ) in central @xmath33 and @xmath7-@xmath7 collisions are shown in fig .",
    "note that at mid - rapidities , these distributions are dominated by the @xmath18 component .",
    "not only the latter is proportional to @xmath69 ( eq . ( [ 2e ] ) ) , but , moreover , @xmath57 is larger than @xmath56 at mid rapidities ( see table 1 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of the two huge maxima of the @xmath19 component in the fragmentation regions , still shows up in the @xmath21 distribution . for a given system ,",
    "the detailed shape of the @xmath8 rapidity distribution depends on the power of @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) . as discussed above",
    "there is some theoretical uncertainty in the value of this power .",
    "however , the variation of the shape of this rapidity distribution from one system to another is a characteristic feature of the model . as seen in fig .",
    "3 , the minimum at mid - rapidities is gradually filled up from @xmath6 to central @xmath7-@xmath7 collisions and , therefore , it is more pronounced in @xmath33 than in @xmath7-@xmath7 .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that baryon stopping can be described using a new formulation of the diquark breaking ( @xmath18 ) mechanism . in this case ,",
    "depicted in fig .  2 ,",
    "the string junction is surrounded by three sea quarks to produce the net baryon .",
    "therefore , not only the net proton yield @xmath70 will be strongly enhanced from @xmath6 to central @xmath21 collisions , but also the net hyperon yield @xmath71 .",
    "this is especially so for @xmath2 s , which can not be produced at all with the @xmath19 mechanism of figs .",
    "1a and 1b .",
    "more precisely the ratio between yields in central @xmath21 and @xmath20 ( or @xmath6 ) collisions will obey to the hierarchy  : @xmath72 .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of the wa97 @xcite and na49 @xcite collaborations .",
    "the relative yields of the different baryon species will be determined by the strangeness suppression factor @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the probability associated to the strange quark and @xmath75 the one associated to the light quarks ( @xmath76 or @xmath77 ) .",
    "we consider two possibilities  : @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) and @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) . with baryons produced out of three sea quarks ( fig .",
    "2 ) it is easy to see that the relative yields are    [ 4e ] i_3 = 4l^3 : 4l^3 : 12l^2s : 3ls^2 : 3ls^2 : s^3    for @xmath0 , @xmath52 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "moreover , we take , @xmath87 .",
    "this reduction in the number of charged @xmath88 s is due to resonance decay ( @xmath89 decays into @xmath90 with an @xmath91 fraction ) .",
    "it is interesting that , in spite of the huge hyperon enhancement observed experimentally , the factors ( [ 4e ] ) lead ( both with @xmath78 and @xmath81 ) to an overestimation of hyperon production in @xmath31 collisions especially for @xmath29 s and @xmath2 s . in central @xmath7-@xmath7 collisions , net hyperon production is also overestimated  except for @xmath2 s . in ref .",
    "@xcite the following explanation of this hyperon excess was proposed : at present energies , it may happen that the net baryon is not formed out of three sea quarks as in fig .",
    "2 , but , due to phase space limitation , a valence quark , at one of the ends of the string where the baryon is produced , is picked up together with two sea quarks .",
    "obviously , in this case the strangeness production rate is substantially reduced ( in particular , @xmath2 production is not possible in this case ) .",
    "the relative yields @xmath92 in ( [ 4e ] ) are then changed into    [ 5e ] i_2 = 2l^2 : 2l^2 : 4ls : s^2/2 : s^2/2 : 0 .    in the following ,",
    "we introduce a free parameter @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) which determines the admixture of @xmath92 and @xmath95 given by ( [ 4e ] ) and ( [ 5e ] ) .",
    "more precisely , we will take the relative yields given by    [ 6e ] i =  i_3 + ( - 1 ) i_2 .",
    "the best description of the data is obtained with @xmath96 for @xmath81 and @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "the results are similar in the two cases  ; the sensitivity to the value of the strangeness suppression factor @xmath73 turns out to be quite small .",
    "the results for the rapidity distribution of the net yields of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in central @xmath7-@xmath7 collisions are given in figs .",
    "note that our rapidity distribution for @xmath99 ( fig .",
    "5 ) is broader than the estimates of the na49 collaboration @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , produces some discrepancies in the @xmath100 yield ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "final data on @xmath1 and @xmath101 are needed in order to clarify the situation  ; we shall come back to this point in section 6 .",
    "the net @xmath1 rapidity distribution in central @xmath33 collisions is shown in fig .",
    "the corresponding results for minimum bias @xmath20 collisions are given in figs .",
    "it is seen that the normalization of the experimental data is larger than the theoretical one especially for @xmath9 .",
    "note , however , that by integrating over @xmath58 the experimental distributions one realizes that their normalization is larger than the number of wounded nucleus in @xmath102 ( given by the glauber model ) by more than a factor 2 .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite this excess may be due to recoil nucleons which are not completely disentangled from the wounded ones .",
    "this point needs clarification .",
    "note that , in our model , the relative yields @xmath92 ( eq . ( [ 4e ] ) ) should apply at higher energies when the phase space limitations are less important . with @xmath103",
    ", they would give a ratio @xmath104 which is in agreement with fermilab @xcite and sps collider data @xcite .",
    "in string models , @xmath36 pair production takes place via diquark - antidiquark pair production in the string fragmentation .",
    "it turns out that at present cern energies only strings of type @xmath11-@xmath12 have large enough invariant mass to produce @xmath36 pairs .",
    "this gives rise to a scaling of @xmath37 yields in the number of participants .",
    "( the number of @xmath11-@xmath12 strings is proportional to the number of wounded nucleons ) .",
    "experimentally , the observed increase is much faster  closer to a scaling in the number of collisions . in order to solve this problem",
    "it was proposed some time ago @xcite to consider the production of @xmath36 pairs from diquark - antidiquark pairs in the sea of the participating nucleons .",
    "the rapidity distribution of antibaryons in @xmath21 collisions is then given by    [ 7e ] dn^aa |b dy ( y ) = |n_a ( dn_string^|b dy ( y ) ) _",
    "|n/|n_a + ( |n -     the first term represents the conventional pair production in the string breaking process . as discussed above , it is proportional to the number of participants .",
    "the second term corresponds to pair production from a string having a sea diquark or antidiquark at one of their ends . in dpm ,",
    "the total number of strings is proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "since the number of strings with a valence diquark at one of their ends is proportional to @xmath54 , the number of strings with a sea diquark at one of their ends is proportional to @xmath105 .",
    "of course , pulling a diquark - antidiquark pair out the nucleon sea is dynamically suppressed  in the same way as its production in the string breaking process is suppressed as compared to @xmath12-@xmath106 production .",
    "thus , we expect that in each individual string , the production of @xmath36 pairs in the two components ( sea and string ) in eq .",
    "( [ 7e ] ) are comparable . in practice ,",
    "the normalization of the second component is treated as a free parameter .",
    "however , it turns out that the sea component is always smaller than the string one , not only at @xmath107 ( see table 1 ) but also after integration over rapidity . note that the string with sea diquarks have a smaller invariant mass .    for the string term",
    "we use the results of ref .",
    "the absolute normalization of this term was determined from a fit of the @xmath6 data . for the @xmath58-dependence of the sea term",
    ", we also use the results of ref . @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , its absolute normalization is a free parameter .",
    "this parameter is the same for all species of baryons .",
    "more precisely , since the baryons and antibaryons in the sea component are made out of three sea quarks or antiquarks , the relative yields of the different baryon species is again given by eq .",
    "( [ 4e ] ) , i.e. no admixture of the type discussed in connection with the @xmath18 component is present here . ] .",
    "( we neglect here the small differences in the rapidity shapes induced by the different baryon masses ) .",
    "we are left in this way with a single free parameter for this new sea component .",
    "therefore , we have a total number of two free parameters , one in the diquark breaking component and one in the sea component  plus the value of the strangeness suppression factor @xmath73 for which two values ( 0.22 and 0.3 ) have been considered .",

    "in central @xmath7-@xmath7 collisions , with our value of the cross - section , it turns out to be comparatively small for @xmath0 and @xmath1 yields .",
    "however , it increases the @xmath29 yields by up to 50  @xmath166 and the @xmath118 yield by a factor 5 .",
    "agreement with the wa97 data @xcite is obtained in this way ( fig .",
    "it is important to note that , due to the small value of @xmath28 , the final state interaction has an important effect only on very rare processes such as @xmath2 production .",

    "note also that na35 finds a ratio @xmath170 at mid - rapidities , while in our model this ratio is always smaller than one ( see fig .",
    "this important point needs clarification .",

    "the @xmath30 yields are in agreement with the wa97 data , after final state interaction ( fig .  12 and 13 ) .    as discussed in section 4 , in our model , the ratios @xmath113 increase with the number of strange quarks in the baryon ( fig .",
    "this tendency is also seen in the data . however , the ratio of ratios @xmath172 is somewhat too small in our model as compared to the wa97 data @xcite , but agrees with the na49 ones @xcite .",
    "( remember , however , that the value of @xmath173 from na49 is preliminary ) .",

    "final state interaction works in the same direction .",
    "this important feature of our results is seen in the data @xcite .",
    "finally , the wa97 collaboration has found that the increase of the hyperon and antihyperon yields per participant ( fig .",
    "15 ) increases faster than the number of participants between @xmath31 and the first centrality bin in @xmath7-@xmath7 .",
    "however , between the first and last centrality bin all yields approximately scale with the number of participants .",

    "however , some mild increase is left in @xmath7-@xmath7 ( fig",
    "the large baryon stopping observed in central heavy ion collisions at cern energy is not reproduced by any of the available independent string models  at least in their original form .",
    "we have modified the dpm by introducing a new realization of the diquark breaking mechanism . we reproduce in this way the observed net baryon yield .",
    "this mechanism also produces an important enhancement of net hyperons . at this level ,",
    "the new version of dpm presented here ( which has also diquark - antiquark pairs in the nucleon sea ) remains strictly an independent string model .",
    "it reproduces with two free parameters , the observed yields of @xmath0 and @xmath1 and their antiparticles in @xmath20 and @xmath7-@xmath7 collisions .",
    "cascades in central @xmath7-@xmath7 collisions are underestimated by less than 50 % while @xmath2 s are too small by a factor 5 .",
    "agreement with experiment is restored by introducing final state interaction with an averaged cross - section as small as @xmath3  mb . in this way",
    ", we depart from string independence .",
    "however , with this small value of the cross - section , there is no significant effect on the bulk of particle production .",
    "a comparable value of the cross - section for final state interaction was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from the experimental data on the energy dependence of cross - sections , averaged over the momentum distribution of the interacting particles obtained in the hadron gas model .",
    "the smallness of this averaged cross - section lead the authors of @xcite to argue that strangeness phase space saturation would be too slow in a hadron gas .",
    "it is interesting that such a small value of the averaged cross - section allows to reproduce the observed enhancement of multi - strange hyperons and antihyperons in central @xmath7-@xmath7 collisions .",
    "the main features of our results are the following  : 1 ) the hyperon yields per participant increase faster than antihyperon ones . as a consequence",
    ", the ratio @xmath113 decreases between @xmath31 and central @xmath7-@xmath7 collisions  ; 2 ) the ratios @xmath115 increase with the number of strange quarks in the hyperon  ; 3 ) the increase of the @xmath26 and @xmath32 yields per participant is faster between @xmath31 and the first centrality bin in @xmath7-@xmath7 collisions and slows down between the first and last centrality bins of wa97 .",
