    "many attempts have been made to explore the details of these correlations . photoinduced two - nucleon knockout experiments like ( @xmath5 or ( @xmath6 ) reactions seem to be an ideal tool for such investigations as the cross section is related to the probability that the real or virtual photon is absorbed by a pair of interacting nucleons . due to",
    "the progress in accelerator and detector technology such triple coincidence experiments with good resolution have become possible and first results have been reported in the literature@xcite .    in studying such reactions , however , it is important to keep in mind that there exist various competing mechanisms which all contribute to the cross section of two - nucleon knockout . beside the contribution which is due to the pair correlations in the ground state wavefunction",
    "one must consider the effects of the two - body terms in the operator for the electromagnetic current .",
    "these two - body terms include meson exchange currents ( mec ) which can be derived from the commutator of the charge density with the nuclear hamiltonian to obey the continuity equation .",
    "these meson exchange current contributions should be evaluated in a way consistent with the nn interaction used to describe the nuclear structure@xcite .",
    "in addition , there are contributions to the two - body current which are of a different origin . here",
    "we , mention the contribution due to the excitation of intermediate @xmath0 isobar excitations@xcite .",
    "the contribution of this isobar current ( ic ) is not constrained by a continuity equation like the mec and therefore depends on parameters like the meson - nucleon @xmath0 coupling constants and the propagator of the @xmath0 in the nuclear medium .",
    "the latter be chosen within certain limits .",
    "the effects of two - body correlations have often been taken into account by assuming a local , state - independent correlation function between the interacting nucleons . from studies of single - nucleon knockout experiments , however , it is known that the energy dependence of the single - particle spectral function is essential for the understanding of the reaction mechanism@xcite . therefore",
    ", one would like to consider dynamical , state - dependent correlations in the investigation of the two - body knockout , too .",
    "one way of achieving this goal is to evaluate the matrix elements for the photon absorption by a correlated pair of nucleons directly in terms of the brueckner @xmath7 matrix and the corresponding propagators for the nucleons .    in this manuscript",
    "we will describe a technique that allows to evaluate the nuclear matrix elements for the absorption of a photon by a correlated pair of nucleons , the mec and the ic in a consistent scheme which includes the effects of the final state interaction of the outgoing nucleons with the residual nucleus in a mean field approximation . as a first step ,",

    "this allows to compare the relative importance of these different mechanisms and their interference under various kinematical conditions .",
    "it is of course a serious disadvantage of such a study in nuclear matter that it does not provide results for a cross section which can directly be compared with experimental data produced for a specific target nucleus . in particular , it is impossible to take advantage of the fact that reactions leading to specific final states of the residual nucleus can be selective for one of the two - nucleon knockout mechanisms discussed above . such a feature has been observed in theoretical studies of ( @xmath8 ) reactions on @xmath9@xcite . on the other hand , however , a study of nuclear matter shall exhibit general features which are independent on the specific target nucleus considered .",
    "a comparison of results for nuclear matter with those obtained for finite systems should enable us to disentangle effects which are global and due to the short - range behaviour of two nucleon correlations from those sensitive to surface and finite size effects .",

    "figure [ fig4 ] ( c ) and ( d ) ] .",
    "the construction of the corresponding operators is not possible via the insertion of a nucleon - nucleon potential in the continuity equation .",
    "in contrast to the deduction of the mec operators in the previous section , here the operators for the isobaric currents are constructed by simply considering the three different components of the absorption process . according to @xcite , diagram ( a ) in figure [ fig4 ]",

    "in contrast to the mecs derived using the continuity equation , isobaric currents also allow for the exchange of uncharged mesons .",
    "they therefore contribute to the knockout of proton - proton pairs .",
    "similar to the outlined procedure , the derivation of the current operators for the three remaining diagrams in figure [ fig4 ] may be performed .",
    "of course , the excitation of a @xmath0 resonance by the absorption of a photon [ diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) ] requires a structure of the @xmath0 propagator different from the propagators for diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the calculation of @xmath70 is performed according to @xcite considering the invariant energy of the final two - nucleon state or the binding energies for the initial states plus the photon energy @xmath15 [ see ( [ eq : econ ] ) ] . following this procedure , one gets for diagram ( a ) of figure [ fig4 ] @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the energy of the @xmath0 state with momentum @xmath73 including the @xmath74 mass difference .",

    "the mec contributions contain the seagull and in - flight currents for the exchange of a @xmath53 meson .",
    "additional mec contributions like the photon absorption on a pair of @xmath53 and @xmath54 mesons were found to give negligible contributions in all kinematical setups we investigated .",
    "the @xmath53-nucleon vertex is compatible with the @xmath53 exchange part of the one - boson - exchange potential bonn a@xcite we used to determine the @xmath7 matrix for calculating the effects of nn correlations .",
    "the same potential has also been used to determine the single - particle energies for the nucleons in the nuclear medium which were parametrized according to ( [ eq : effm ] ) by @xmath85 and @xmath86 .    as a first example",
    ", we would like to consider the case of ( @xmath8 ) reactions in the so - called super parallel kinematical situation where the momentum @xmath33 of one knocked - out proton has the same direction as the photon momentum .",
    "the momentum of the second proton @xmath34 is opposite to this direction .",
    "the photon energy is fixed at @xmath87 .",
    "results are shown in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "the left section of this figure displays results selecting an asymmetric distribution of the photon energy to the two protons .",
    "the one with final momentum parallel to @xmath88 is chosen to have a final kinetic energy of @xmath89 while the second one with momentum antiparallel to @xmath88 has a final energy of @xmath90 . for comparison",
    ", we also present the example in which the photon energy is distributed in a more symmetric way with @xmath91 and @xmath92 in the right part of figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "the upper part of this figure exhibits results for the longitudinal structure function @xmath1 while the transverse structure function @xmath2 is displayed in the lower parts of the figure .",
    "as it has been discussed in the previous section , the mec originating from @xmath53 exchange do not contribute to the photon induced two - proton knockout process .",
    "the isobar currents ( ic ) only affect the transverse structure function @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the results for the longitudinal structure functions @xmath1 displayed in the upper part of figure [ fig5 ] are solely due to the effects of correlations",
    ". we can see that this correlation contribution @xmath1 is significantly larger in the case of asymmetric energy distribution ( upper left part of the figure ) than in the case of more symmetric energy distribution .",
    "note the different scales on these parts of the figures .",
    "the correlation contribution ` prefers ' processes in which the momentum and the energy of the virtual photon is absorbed by one proton which is knocked - out parallel to the momentum @xmath93 , while the second proton receives only a smaller fraction .",
    "the situation is rather similar for the transverse structure function @xmath2 . also here , the cross section due to correlations ( dashed line ) is significantly larger in the case of asymmetric energy distribution . the contribution of the ic to the structure function ( dashed - dotted lines ) is similar in magnitude for the two cases considered .",
    "the correlation and isobar contributions to the total structure function @xmath2 ( solid lines ) are of similar importance for the more symmetric distribution of energy , while the correlation contribution is dominating the cross section in the asymmetric case , in particular at larger photon momenta .    as a next example , we discuss the ( @xmath94 ) reaction under the same kinematical conditions . here , we consider the case with the proton emitted parallel to the photon momentum and the neutron momentum antiparallel to @xmath88 . in this case",
    ", we have to take into account the effects of mec as well ( solid line with squares ) . comparing the knockout of a proton - neutron pair to the ejection of a pair of protons",
    ", one observes that the structure functions for the @xmath3 reaction are roughly 10 times bigger than the structure functions for the @xmath4 reactions ( see figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "this fraction is slightly larger for transverse photon polarisation than for longitudinally polarized virtual photons .",
    "this enhancement of the structure functions is , of course , partly due to the mec .",
    "we find , however , that the contribution of correlations to the structure functions alone are enhanced by roughly a factor of 7 comparing ( @xmath94 ) with @xmath4 .",
    "this demonstrates the importance of tensor correlations which are more effective in the @xmath95 than in the @xmath96 interaction .",
    "again , we notice that the correlation effect is stronger when the photon energy and momentum is distributed in a rather asymmetric way to the knocked - out nucleons ( left column of figure [ fig6 ] ) .    in the super parallel kinematical setup ,",
    "the mec contribution is of particular importance in the transverse structure function ( lower sections of figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "it dominates the corresponding cross section in the case of the more symmetric energy distribution . in the asymmetric case , however , the ratio of mec to correlation contribution depends in quite a sensitive way on the photon momenta and is in the average twice as large as the correlation contribution for the cases considered .",
    "the ic contribution is small in all these cases since the photon energy considered ( @xmath15 = 215 mev ) is below the threshold of the @xmath0 .    in order to investigate the dependence of the mec contribution on the kind of structure function",
    ", we display in figure [ fig7 ] the contribution of the @xmath53-seagull terms [ diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ] and the @xmath53-in - flight term [ fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( c ) ] separately for the asymmetric kinematic discussed in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "these contributions are of similar importance in the longitudinal structure function but cancel each other almost completely .",
    "such a strong cancellation does not occur in the transverse channel in which the @xmath53-in - flight term dominates .",
    "therefore , one may consider the longitudinal structure function for ( @xmath94 ) reactions in super parallel kinematics as an ideal setup to study effects of correlations .    a large contribution from mec",
    "is observed in other kinematical setups . as an example",
    ", we show in figure [ fig8 ] the longitudinal and transverse structure functions depending on the photon momentum @xmath97 for a symmetric splitting of the kinetic energies and the angles with respect to the direction of the momentum transfer of the outgoing particles ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) .",
    "the photon energy was chosen to be @xmath100 . in this framework , the influence of the single - particle current ( correlations ) is almost negligible compared to the dominating mec contribution . at higher photon momenta , the isobaric current contribution gets even more important than the correlation contribution .",
    "finally , we would like to add a few remarks on the evaluation of the isobar contribution to the two - body current . as an example",
    ", we consider in figure [ fig9 ] the ic contribution to the transverse structure function of ( @xmath94 ) using the kinematical setup of figure [ fig6 ] ( left part ) .",
    "the ic contribution is rather sensitive to the approximation employed for the @xmath0 propagator @xcite .",
    "the correct evaluation of the propagator ( [ delprop ] ) for the resonant [ figure [ fig4 ] ( a ) and ( b ) ] and non - resonant [ figure [ fig4 ] ( c ) and ( d ) ] terms , as discussed above , leads to an ic contribution ( solid line ) which is significantly smaller than the one obtained if a propagator of the form ( [ propag1 ] ) is used for the resonant as well as the non - resonant case ( dashed line ) .",
    "the static propagator ( [ propag2 ] ) replacing the energy denominators for the propagators in all four terms of the figure [ fig4 ] by the @xmath0 nucleon mass difference leads to a structure function ( dashed - dotted line ) which is roughly a factor of three larger than the exact result and also the propagator suggested in @xcite ( dotted line ) overestimates the correct result by roughly a factor of two .",
    "the contributions originating from nucleon - nucleon correlations , meson - exchange currents ( mec ) and isobar currents ( ic ) to the cross section for photon induced two - nucleon knock - out reactions ( @xmath101 ) have been investigated by evaluating the corresponding matrix elements in a consistent way for a system of infinite nuclear matter .",
    "the relative importance of these various contributions is quite sensitive to the kinematical setup of such triple coincidence experiments .",
    "the so called super - parallel kinematic turns out to be very appropriate for the investigation of nn correlation effects .",
    "this is particularly true for reactions in which momentum and energy of the absorbed photon are transfered predominantly on one of the nucleons knocked - out : correlations seem not to be very ` efficient ' to transfer large amounts of energy to the second nucleon .",
    "the ( @xmath8 ) reactions are favourable for the study of nn correlations because the competing two - body current contributions are suppressed : the mec from @xmath53-exchange which dominate ( @xmath94 ) reactions do nt contribute in this case and ic only show up in the transverse structure function .",
    "however , it is very important to investigate ( @xmath94 ) reactions as well .",
    "the @xmath95 correlations are quite different from the @xmath96 correlations , the structure functions originating from correlation effects are by a factor of 5 to 10 larger for the @xmath95 knock - out than for ( @xmath8 ) .    the mec contributions which are dominating in many kinematical setups , are highly suppressed in the super parallel kinematics in which the proton is observed in the direction of the photon and the neutron is detected anti - parallel to the momentum of the photon .",
    "the suppression of the mec is due to a strong cancellation between the @xmath53-seagull and @xmath53-in - flight contribution .",
    "the correlation effects should show up in particular in the longitudinal structure function in this kinematical setup .",
    "the present study includes the effects of a final state interaction between the knocked - out nucleons and the residual interaction on the level of a mean - field approximation .",
    "one should also consider , however , the contribution to the cross section which originates from the direct interaction of the two nucleons after the absorption of the photon .",
    "this can be done in the scheme outlined in this manuscript .",
    "this calculation scheme for correlations and two - body currents should also be applied directly to the evaluation of cross section for specific target nuclei .",
