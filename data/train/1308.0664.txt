    "the physics of the crossover between the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) state of weakly bound cooper pairs and the bose - einstein condensed ( bec ) state of tightly bound composite bosons , i.e. , the bcs - bec crossover , has long been one of the major issues in condensed matter physics .",
    "the idea of a continuous crossover between the bcs and bec limits first arose in the 1960s as a problem of exciton condensation near the semimetal - semiconductor transition , which is called the ` excitonic insulator ' state.@xcite the bcs - bec crossover also attracted attention from the early stages of the theory of superconductivity , where eagles@xcite first addressed this issue in metals with a very low electron density . in 1980 , using a variational approach , leggett@xcite showed a smooth crossover from the weak - coupling bcs state to the strong - coupling bec state at zero temperature .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath4 across the bcs - bec crossover was first evaluated by nozires and schmitt - rink.@xcite in 1986 , the discovery of high-@xmath4 cuprate materials , where the coherence length is only a few times larger than the lattice spacing , led to intensive discussion on the possible realization of the bcs - bec crossover in cuprate superconductors.@xcite    in systems of ultracold fermionic atoms , the crossover between the bcs - type and bec - type superfluid states has also been observed,@xcite where the interaction strength is controlled through a magnetically tuned feshbach resonance . in particular ,",
    "a two - dimensional ultracold fermi gas has recently been realized experimentally in a very controlled manner,@xcite although the inclusion of an optical lattice potential to realize the two - dimensional fermi - hubbard model has yet to be carried out.@xcite in the study of such two - dimensional fermi gas systems , where tunable and clean samples have become available,@xcite the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless superfluidity@xcite without condensation,@xcite the presence of the pairing pseudogap,@xcite bcs - bec crossover,@xcite and two- to three - dimensional crossovers@xcite have been discussed intensively in recent years .    motivated by the above developments in the field , in this study",
    ", we investigate the bcs - bec crossover of the superconducting ground state in the two - dimensional attractive hubbard model.@xcite thus far , focusing on numerical studies , the bcs - bec crossover of this model has been explored mostly using the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft),@xcite where the correlation effects can be taken into account only in the infinite dimension .",
    "the cellular dmft somehow improves the effects of finite dimensionality.@xcite we here employ the variational cluster approximation ( vca ) based on the self - energy functional theory ( sft),@xcite where we can take into account the effects of short - range spatial correlations even in low - dimensional systems , thereby reproducing the momentum dependences of physical quantities precisely .",
    "this method has been shown to be useful for discussing the spontaneous symmetry breaking of correlated electron models beyond the mean - field theory;@xcite however , to the best of our knowledge , it has not been used to study the bcs - bec crossover in the attractive hubbard model .",
    "therefore , using vca , we first discuss the interaction ( @xmath5 ) dependence of the order parameter of superconductivity .",
    "we will show that the order parameter is suppressed in comparison with that obtained using the mean - field theory owing to the effects of spatial fluctuations in low - dimensional systems . in order to show the dynamics of the bcs - bec crossover",
    ", we will then use the cluster perturbation theory ( cpt)@xcite to calculate the single - particle and anomalous green s functions . we will present the single - particle spectra and densities of states to clarify the behavior of the superconducting gap .",
    "we will also present the bogoliubov quasiparticle spectra and condensation amplitude to discuss the character of cooper pairs in the bcs and bec states .",
    "in particular , we will evaluate the pair coherence length @xmath0 from the condensation amplitude and demonstrate the smooth crossover from a weakly paired bcs state ( @xmath6 ) to a bec state of tightly bound pairs ( @xmath7 ) , where @xmath3 is the lattice constant .",
    "we will finally calculate the kinetic and potential energies in the superconducting and normal ground states and show that the superconducting state is driven by the gain in potential energy in the bcs state , but by the gain in kinetic energy in the bec state , in agreement with previous theories.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows . in sect .  2",
    ", we will introduce the attractive hubbard model and briefly summarize the method of vca for discussing an @xmath8-wave superconducting state .",
    "in sect .  3 , we will show the calculated results for various physical quantities and discuss the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "a summary of the paper will be given in sect .",
    "to discuss the bcs - bec crossover , we use the attractive hubbard model defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is the fermion creation ( annihilation ) operator with spin @xmath12 at site @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is the hopping integral between nearest - neighbor sites , @xmath16 is the on - site attractive interaction , and @xmath17 is the chemical potential for maintaining the number of particles in the system .",
    "it is known@xcite that the superconducting state is always realized in two and higher dimensions at @xmath18 k for all values of @xmath5 @xmath19 and in the entire particle density range , except at half filling where the superconducting and density - wave states are degenerate .",
    "we use vca , which is an extension of the cpt based on the self - energy functional theory ( sft ) .",
    "following potthoff,@xcite we write the grand - potential functional as @xmath20=\\lambda[\\bm{\\sigma}]-{\\rm tr}\\ln(-{\\bm g}^{-1}_{0}+\\bm{\\sigma})$ ] , where @xmath21 $ ] is the legendre transform of the luttinger - ward functional and @xmath22 is the noninteracting green s function .",

    "the sft provides a way to compute @xmath25 based on the fact that the functional form of @xmath21 $ ] depends only on the interaction terms of the hamiltonian . here",
    ", we introduce disconnected finite - size clusters forming a superlattice as a reference system ; each cluster has the exact grand potential @xmath26-{\\rm tr}\\ln(-\\bm{g}'^{-1}_{0}+\\bm{\\sigma}')$ ] , where @xmath27 is the exact self - energy of the reference system . because the original and reference systems have the same interaction term , their functional forms @xmath21 $ ] are the same .",
    "therefore , by restricting the trial @xmath23 to @xmath27 , we can eliminate the functional @xmath21 $ ] and obtain @xmath28=\\omega'-{\\rm tr}\\ln(\\bm{i}-\\bm{vg'}),\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the unit matrix , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the exact green s function of the reference system .    the trial self - energy for the variational method is generated from the exact self - energy ( or the exact green s function ) of the reference system , for which the hamiltonian is defined as @xmath32 where the weiss field for the @xmath8-wave pairing @xmath33 and the on - site potential @xmath34 are variational parameters .",
    "note that @xmath34 is introduced in order to calculate the particle density @xmath35 correctly .",
    "then , we solve the ground - state eigenvalue problem @xmath36 of a finite - size ( @xmath37 sites ) cluster and calculate the trial green s function by the lanczos exact - diagonalization method .",
    "we use the nambu formalism @xmath38 to solve the eigenvalue problem of eq .",

    "the variational parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 are optimized on the basis of the variational principle , i.e. , @xmath57 .",
    "the solution with @xmath58 corresponds to the superconducting state . the average particle density @xmath35 @xmath59 is expressed as @xmath60 and , throughout the paper",

    "a cluster of size @xmath64 is used as a reference system ; the effects of on - site correlations within this cluster are taken into account exactly",
    ". detailed techniques of vca can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "we first calculate the @xmath5 dependence of the superconducting order parameter @xmath65 . within the framework of vca , the anomalous expectation value @xmath66 is defined as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the off - diagonal term of the green s function @xmath69 .",
    "we also evaluate the binding energy of the pair @xmath70 from the single - particle excitation gap .",
    "for comparison with the results of vca , we also evaluate the order parameter in the mean - field ( mf ) theory , which gives @xmath71 as a solution of the self - consistent equations .",
    "the results for @xmath72 and @xmath70 calculated using the vca and mf theory are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in the mf theory , the order parameter @xmath73 increases exponentially with @xmath5 , thereby satisfying the relation @xmath74 in the weak - coupling limit . in the strong - coupling limit , on the other hand , @xmath75 @xmath76 and @xmath77 at @xmath78 , regardless of the spatial dimension .",
    "we find that the result of vca exhibits the same behavior as that of the mf theory in the weak - coupling limit : @xmath71 increases exponentially with @xmath5 , satisfying the relation @xmath79 , which recovers the exponential behavior of the bcs mean - field theory . in the intermediate - coupling region , we find that @xmath72 and @xmath70 are significantly suppressed in comparison with those in the case of the mf theory , which is due to the quantum fluctuations of the system . in the strong - coupling limit , @xmath70 converges to the result of the mf theory , @xmath80 [ see the inset of fig .",

    ", the attractive hubbard model can be mapped onto the spin-1/2 heisenberg model in a magnetic field , @xmath83 where we use the particle - hole transformation @xmath84 and @xmath85,@xcite and define @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "the superconducting state in the original model at quarter filling ( @xmath78 ) corresponds to the antiferromagnetically ordered state in the @xmath89 plane in the effective model with the magnetization @xmath90 .",
    "it is known@xcite that , in the two - dimensional square lattice , strong quantum fluctuations caused by the low dimensionality of the system suppress the long - range staggered magnetic order in the @xmath89 plane in comparison with those in the case of classical approximation .",
    "therefore , because vca takes into account the short - range spatial correlations and quantum fluctuations in the low - dimensional systems , it is reasonable that the order parameter @xmath72 obtained using vca is significantly suppressed in comparison with the result of the mf theory .    to compare the result of vca with those of the dmft calculations , which are justified in the infinite dimension",
    ", we notice that our result for @xmath72 in the strong - coupling limit is quite different : @xmath72 in dmft increases to the constant value obtained in the mf theory,@xcite whereas , in vca , it converges to a significantly smaller value , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "the mf theory for the heisenberg model is exact in the infinite dimension ; therefore , the results of the dmft calculations are consistent with the results of the mf theory in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "the difference between the dmft and vca results is thus caused by the effects of spatial quantum fluctuations in low - dimensional systems , which the dmft can not take into account .",
    "the single - particle and anomalous green s functions are calculated using cpt with the optimized variational parameters , which are defined as @xmath91 from which we calculate the single - particle and bogoliubov quasiparticle spectra defined respectively as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the artificial lorentzian broadening .",

    "corresponding to @xmath107 , @xmath110 exhibits a sharp peak at @xmath100 ( @xmath111 ) and decreases rapidly as the momentum goes away from @xmath100 .",
    "the sharp peak of @xmath108 in the @xmath112-space indicates that the radius of the pair is large in real space ( weakly bound pairs ) . with increasing @xmath5 , @xmath113 and @xmath110",

    "in the strong - coupling region ( at @xmath105 ) , @xmath110 is spread out over the brillouin zone ; therefore , the pairs are tightly bound in real space .      in order to see the spatial extension of the cooper pair directly ,",

    "note that @xmath0 is already of the size of the lattice constant at @xmath118 . in comparison with the results of vca and the mf theory , @xmath0 evaluated by vca is significantly larger than the results of the mf theory , which is due again to the quantum fluctuations of the system , just as in @xmath70 shown in fig .",

    "@xmath0 evaluated using vca and",
    "the mf theory converges to 0 ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "finally , we calculate the ground - state energies of the attractive hubbard model in the superconducting and normal states .",
    "the total ground - state energy @xmath121 is given as @xmath122 .",
    "using the double occupancy defined as @xmath123 , we obtain the potential energy @xmath124 as @xmath125 , and the kinetic energy @xmath126 as @xmath127 .",
    "the calculated results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where the difference @xmath128 denotes the energy of the superconducting state minus the energy of the normal state .",
    "first , let us consider the behavior of @xmath124 and @xmath126 .",
    "in the noninteracting limit , @xmath129 is given by @xmath130 since @xmath131 in the uncorrelated fermion systems .",
    "in the strong - coupling limit , on the other hand , all the fermions are tightly bound to form composite bosons and hence @xmath129 is given by the particle density as @xmath132 .",
    "the calculated result for @xmath129 shows a smooth crossover from the weakly paired bcs state ( @xmath133 ) to the tightly paired bec state ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "therefore , with increasing @xmath5 , @xmath124 decreases owing to the pair formation and @xmath126 increases owing to the gap opening , resulting in a gradual decrease in @xmath121 , irrespective of whether the ground state is superconducting or normal ; the effects of the presence of the order parameter are found to be rather small .",
    "then , let us see the effects of the order parameter , the results of which are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . in the weak - coupling region , we find that the superconducting state occurs owing to the loss of kinetic energy ( @xmath135 ) and gain in potential energy ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "this means that , in the bcs weak - coupling limit , the decrease in the potential energy due to the cooper pair formation overwhelms the loss of kinetic energy due to the broadening of the fermi edge .",
    "thus , in the weak - coupling region , the superconducting state is driven by the gain in potential energy . in our calculation , the bcs features ( @xmath137 and @xmath138 ) vanish at @xmath139 .    in the strong - coupling region , on the other hand , the roles are interchanged , i.e. , the superconducting state is characterized by @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "this means that , in the bec strong - coupling limit , tightly bound composite bosons gain in kinetic energy because they condense at @xmath142 in momentum space , simultaneously when the order parameter becomes nonzero .",
    "the loss of the potential energy arises because the motion of composite bosons is accompanied necessarily by the breaking of on - site pairs .",
    "thus , in the strong - coupling region , the superconducting state is driven by the gain in kinetic energy . in our calculation , the bec features ( @xmath143 and @xmath141 ) appear at @xmath144 .",
    "these behaviors of the kinetic and potential energies in the attractive hubbard model are qualitatively consistent with the results of the previous dmft calculations.@xcite",
    "we have studied the superconducting ground state in the two - dimensional attractive hubbard model by vca .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath5 dependence of the order parameter and have shown that the order parameter is suppressed in comparison with that obtained using the mean - field theory owing to spatial fluctuations in the low - dimensional system . in order to discuss the character of the bcs - bec crossover , cpt has been used to calculate the single - particle and anomalous green s functions .",
    "we have shown that the single - particle spectra and densities of states clearly exhibit the behavior of the superconducting gap and that the bogoliubov quasiparticle spectra and condensation amplitude characterize cooper pairs in momentum space that changes continuously from the bcs state to the bec state . from the calculated condensation amplitude ,",
    "we have evaluated the pair coherence length @xmath0 , which demonstrates the smooth crossover in real space from the weakly paired bcs state ( @xmath6 ) to the bec state of tightly bound pairs ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we have also calculated the kinetic and potential energies in the superconducting and normal ground states and have shown that the superconducting state is driven by the gain in potential energy in the bcs state , but by the gain in kinetic energy in the bec state .",

    "<S> we use the variational cluster approximation to study the superconducting ground state in the two - dimensional attractive hubbard model , putting particular emphasis on the significance of quantum fluctuations of the system . </S>",
    "<S> we first show that the order parameter is suppressed in comparison with that obtained using the mean - field theory owing to the effects of spatial fluctuations in two - dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that the calculated bogoliubov quasiparticle spectra and condensation amplitude clearly exhibit the character of cooper pairs in momentum space and that the pair coherence length @xmath0 evaluated from the condensation amplitude demonstrates a smooth crossover in real space from a weakly paired bcs state ( @xmath1 ) to a bec state of tightly bound pairs ( @xmath2 ) , where @xmath3 is the lattice constant . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated kinetic and potential energies in the superconducting and normal ground states indicate that the superconducting state in the weak - coupling region is driven by the gain in potential energy , while that in the strong - coupling region is driven by the gain in kinetic energy . </S>"
