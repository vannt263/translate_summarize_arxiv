    "the renormalization group ( rg ) is a fundamental tool in theoretical physics @xcite .",
    "it allows to characterize phase transitions and critical phenomena , by computing critical exponents and universality classes .",
    "the real space rg can be viewed as a decimation procedure that takes a system made of @xmath0 dynamical variables and reduces it to a smaller system , in a way which preserves , or scales appropriately , some important physical observables .",
    "such a decimation induces a rg transformation on the system couplings , and the study of such a transformation allows one to identify critical points and critical exponents .",
    "real space rg transformations have been studied in great detail for homogeneous models @xcite , but much less is known for disordered models , that contain quenched randomness in the hamiltonian ( either random fields and/or random couplings ) .",
    "this is specially true for strongly frustrated models , like spin glasses ( sg ) , for which a satisfying rg transformation is still lacking .",
    "for example , for the edwards - anderson sg model @xcite on a @xmath1-dimensional lattice all the attempts to develop a field theory by performing an @xmath2-expansion around the upper critical dimension @xmath3 have proved to be very complicated @xcite .",
    "these studies have led to the discovery of fixed points different from the mean - field ( mf ) ones , however the implications of that are not completely clear . in particular the existence of replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) fixed points in the non - mean field region @xmath4 has been shown only very recently @xcite and estimates of critical exponents in @xmath5 are still not reliable .    in this framework",
    "the development of a ( semi-)analytical real space rg for disordered models would be very welcome .",
    "the outcome of such a rg transformation could be well compared with monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , that provide accurate estimates of critical temperatures and critical exponents for disordered models ( at a much higher computational cost ) .    since the first developments of rg transformations for models with quenched disorder it was clear that one has to deal with distributions of couplings @xcite .",
    "but the rg transformation for an entire coupling distribution is highly non - trivial .",
    "previous attempts of developing a real space rg for disordered systems @xcite focused on transformations mapping a single sample of size @xmath0 to a smaller system ( without loss of generality we can set the size of the smaller system to @xmath6 ) . in formulae , we can write the mapping @xmath7 as the one solving a set of equations like @xmath8 where angular brackets are thermal averages with respect to the gibbs - boltzmann distribution , primed quantities refer to the smaller system and the number of observables @xmath9 is enough to determine the new couplings @xmath10 . given an ensemble of systems of size @xmath0",
    ", the above transformation can be applied to each of them in order to obtain an ensemble of systems of size @xmath6 .",
    "however we believe that such a mapping is suboptimal for models with quenched disorder and a better rg transformation should consider explicitly the average over the quenched disorder ( as was done e.g.  in ref .",
    "what we are proposing is a mapping between probability distributions of couplings @xmath11 such that the following equations hold @xmath12 the overbar represents the average over the quenched disorder ( i.e.  the couplings in the present case ) .",
    "the rationale beyond this choice is that in models with strong disorder ( like sg ) sample - to - sample fluctuations may dominate thermal ones .",
    "it is worth noticing that standard rg transformations working on coupling distributions typically use eq .",
    "( [ oldrg ] ) .",
    "for example , the simplest rg transformation for the bond percolation problem in 2 dimensions ( @xmath13 ) or even the more complicated one of ref .",
    "@xcite can be viewed as single sample transformations , where @xmath14 is the bond density by which the larger samples are generated and @xmath15 is the bond density of the renormalized samples ( one - by - one ) . instead , the new approach in eq .",
    "( [ ourrg ] ) would prescribe to compute some physical quantity ( e.g.  a correlation or a probability of being connected ) in the ensemble of larger systems with bond density @xmath14 , and to repeat the same computation in the ensemble of smaller systems with several bond densities in order to find the best value @xmath15 such that the physical observables match in the two ensembles .",
    "the new approach we are proposing resembles in some way the finite size scaling analysis which is performed on monte carlo data measured in systems of different sizes .",
    "obviously , for models where the rg transformation is exact ( like e.g.  the diamond hierarchical lattices @xcite ) the old and the new approaches provide the same answer .",
    "two simple examples may help elucidating even more the limits of the rg transformation working sample by sample , eq.([oldrg ] ) , and thus justify the use of the one in eq.([ourrg ] ) , that we will call ensemble rg ( erg ) . in a diluted ferromagnet with long range interactions , where couplings are positive with probability @xmath14 and null with probability @xmath16 , a single step of the decimation procedure induced by eq.([oldrg ] )",
    "typically generates all non - zero couplings ( i.e. @xmath17 ) . and",
    "this is clearly not very useful if one is willing to follow the rg flow in the @xmath18 plane .",
    "moreover , in frustrated models the decimated system is typically much less frustrated than the original one : the extreme case is the transformation of a 4-spins system in a 2-spins system , being the latter unfrustrated for any coupling choice !",
    "this tendency to reduce frustration makes the rg using eq.([oldrg ] ) clearly unfit to describe sg fixed points .    in principle",
    ", our erg scheme can be applied to any disordered system .",
    "we choose here to apply it to the hierarchical model ( hm ) , which is a particular one - dimensional long range model , whose hamiltonian for @xmath19 spins can be constructed iteratively in the following way @xcite : @xmath20 in practice @xmath21 is the sum of interactions at @xmath22 different levels .",
    "we have studied three versions of this model : the ferromagnet ( fm ) , where @xmath23 ; the diluted ferromagnet ( dfm ) , where a random fraction @xmath16 of fm couplings are set to zero ; and the sg version @xcite , with gaussian couplings @xmath24 .",
    "there are many reasons to test a new rg transformation on the hm .",
    "first , by properly tuning the topological factor @xmath25 that controls how fast the couplings intensity decays with distance , the hm can emulate a @xmath1-dimensional short range ( sr ) model : @xmath26 for dfm and @xmath27 for sg @xcite .",
    "these relations are exact around the upper critical dimensions because the long range hm and the sr @xmath1-dimensional model have the same field theory at leading order . in order to have a phase transition at a finite temperature ,",
    "the @xmath25 parameter must satisfy @xmath28 for the dfm and @xmath29 for the sg .",
    "lower bound values @xmath30 correspond to lower critical dimensions ( and thus @xmath31 ) , while when @xmath32 the energy is no longer extensive ( thus @xmath33 ) .",
    "for @xmath34 in dfm and @xmath35 in sg , the model shows mean field critical properties ( like for @xmath36 in sr models ) .",
    "so , tuning a single parameter in the hm , we can move from the mf region to a non - mf one .",
    "the second reason to choose the hm , is that if the system is decimated by a standard block - spin transformation , the new hamiltonian does not contain any multi - spin term ( at variance to what happen on finite dimensional lattices @xcite ) .",
    "so , considering only pairwise interactions in the rg is not an approximation for the hm . moreover the fm version can be exactly solved in a time growing only polynomially with @xmath0 , since the probability distribution of the magnetization satisfies @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the magnetizations of the half systems .",
    "it is worth stressing that eq .",
    "( [ eq : pm ] ) is no more valid for the sg version of the hm , which does not admit a polynomial time solution . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pm ] ) has been proposed to describe the distribution of the overlap @xmath40 in the sg version of the hm ; however we will not make use of this relation , due to the difficulties in its treatment .",
    "schematic representation of the erg for a sg hm with @xmath41 .",
    "variances ( @xmath42 ) and renormalized variances ( @xmath43 ) at each level @xmath44 are indicated . ]",
    "we describe now in detail how to apply the erg to the hm . we assume couplings to remain independent during the rg , but we allow couplings to have a different probability distribution @xmath45 ( or a different value @xmath46 in the fm version ) at each level @xmath47 : in the original hm all couplings have the same probability law , but we have seen that the rg iteration produces different couplings at different levels . in the analyzed versions ,",
    "each coupling distribution is parametrized by @xmath48 few numbers ( that is the mean for fm , the variance for sg , the fraction of non - zero couplings and the mean for dfm ) , otherwise the search for a solution to eq.([ourrg ] ) would become too difficult .",
    "we start from an ensemble of systems with @xmath22 levels that we want to reduce to an `` equivalent '' ensemble of smaller systems of @xmath49 levels .",
    "the whole procedure is described in fig .",
    "[ reduction ] for a sg hm with @xmath41 .",
    "first we compute @xmath50 observables @xmath51 , @xmath52 in the larger systems extracted from the original coupling distribution ( in the fm the overbar can be omitted ) .",
    "[ step2]then we identify the new distributions of couplings @xmath53 , @xmath54 for the ensemble of smaller systems , i.e. , we determine the new @xmath50 parameters of the @xmath55 distributions , by requiring that @xmath56 for any @xmath57 .",
    "finally we build a new ensemble of systems of the original size .",
    "they are constructed joining with random couplings extracted from the original distribution @xmath58 two smaller systems with couplings extracted from @xmath53 , @xmath59 found at step [ step2 ] .",
    "primed quantities refer to the smaller systems . in this case",
    "the parameters to be determined are the variances of the gaussian distributions at each level .",
    "the first two steps are the true renormalization steps , while the latter is required to obtain a final system size , that will allow us to iterate the method , until convergence . in the disordered versions ,",
    "the assumption that the renormalized coupling distributions are of the same type as the original ones is an approximation . however it can be easily improved adding extra terms in the distributions .",
    "thermal averages are computed exactly : this is easy to do in the fm , thanks to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pm ] ) , while in the dfm and in the sg we do it by exhaustive enumeration , thus limiting us to a small number of levels in the disordered cases .",
    "the average over the disorder is not exact , but taken over @xmath60 samples .",
    "step 2 is actually accomplished by minimizing @xmath61 , and we have checked that the reached minimum is always very close to zero . since couplings distributions are different at each level , we do not see any better option than extracting the new couplings at level @xmath22 in step 3 from the original distribution @xmath58 .",
    "the fm version of the hm , for which exact rg equations can be written , is a benchmark for our numerical implementation of the erg . for @xmath62 , that corresponds to @xmath63 ,",
    "the critical temperature is @xmath64 @xcite , and the critical exponents are @xmath65 , @xmath66 @xcite , leading to @xmath67 using the scaling relations . to compare this critical exponent @xmath68 with the one for a sr 3d ising fm ,",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the following equation should be used with a proper @xmath25@xmath1 relation @xmath69 in the present case @xmath70 is close to @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the observables @xmath9 that we use in the rg equations are the correlation of the magnetization at level @xmath72 , normalized by those at level @xmath44 , with @xmath54 : @xmath73 the denominator is needed to reduce finite size effects and to ensure that a solution to the rg equations always exists ( this is not true in general for other observables , like the magnetization ) .    applying the previously described procedure ,",
    "the flux of couplings and correlations can be followed , see fig .",
    "[ coupling ] .",
    "if @xmath74 , renormalized couplings stay for a while close to the critical fixed point ( fp ) , and then go towards the high temperature ( ht ) fp if @xmath75 or the low temperature ( lt ) fp if @xmath76 .",
    "we estimate the critical temperature as the temperature dividing the flows towards the two different fp .",
    "please note that the ht and lt fixed points are not characterized by the usual @xmath77 and @xmath78 coupling values : the reason is that in step 3 of our procedure we put new coupling of original intensity .",
    "nonetheless couplings flows clearly differentiate ht and lt behaviors .",

    "an equation relating renormalized coupling after @xmath82 rg steps can be obtained : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the scaling factor in our case .",
    "thus , the @xmath68 exponent can be estimated from a fit like the one in fig .",
    "the values obtained for the critical temperature and the critical exponents in @xmath63 are well comparable with the known ones : @xmath85 extrapolates to @xmath86 in the large @xmath22 limit and the measured @xmath68 exponent is @xmath87 for @xmath81 ( although the extrapolation of @xmath68 to the @xmath88 limit is difficult due to strong finite size effects , e.g. @xmath89 for @xmath90 ) .",
    "moreover we have checked that our numerical rg recovers the right bounds on @xmath25 , namely @xmath91 for @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "we consider now the dfm .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is always the one in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hindip ] ) , but the couplings at level @xmath44 are independent random variables extracted from the distribution @xmath95 at the beginning @xmath96 and @xmath97 for any @xmath44 , while under the rg they will differentiate .",

    "the validity of the phase diagram found with the erg is confirmed by a set of mc simulations ( explained later in the text ) whose @xmath85 estimates are also shown in fig .",
    "the only disappointment about this phase diagram is that we do not find an unstable fp along the critical line as expected for a @xmath5 sr model @xcite .",

    "we locate the critical temperature at @xmath103 . ]",
    "finally we study the sg version .",
    "the hamiltonian is always the one in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hindip ] ) , and the couplings at level @xmath44 are distributed with a gaussian law of zero mean and variance @xmath104 ( at the beginning @xmath105 for any @xmath44 ) .",
    "the assumptions that the renormalized couplings are independent and normally distributed could be released by adding extra terms in the coupling distributions @xcite , but we leave these generalizations for future works . in the sg case",
    "the observables used to fix the @xmath49 variances are normalized sg correlations at different levels : @xmath106 because of the computational costs we use @xmath107 , so the early regime leaving the critical fp is rather short , and the stationary regime is soon reached ( with respect to the fm case ) .",
    "this effect is also enhanced by the disorder : indeed , even exactly at criticality , the sg ensemble contains many samples which are not critical , and the couplings of these samples flow away from critical values very fast .",

    "<S> we propose and study a renormalization group transformation that can be used also for models with strong quenched disorder , like spin glasses . </S>",
    "<S> the method is based on a mapping between disorder distributions , chosen such as to keep some physical properties ( e.g. the ratio of correlations averaged over the ensemble ) invariant under the transformation . </S>",
    "<S> we validate this ensemble renormalization group ( erg ) by applying it to the hierarchical model ( both the diluted ferromagnetic version and the spin glass version ) , finding results in agreement with monte carlo simulations . </S>"
