    "semiconductor and insulating crystals doped with transition metal ions have found numerous applications in modern technological devices , e.g.  solid - state laser , solid - state lighting , scintillators and infrared to visible up - conversion .",
    "@xcite the open @xmath0 shell of @xmath3 dopant ions play a central role in the optical properties of these materials , providing low - lying excited states involving @xmath4 multiplets and tunable optical transitions , which are controlled by the interactions these ions experience in host materials of different chemical compositions and crystal structures . together with the @xmath0-electron on - site correlation , these interactions with the crystal determine the overall energy level schemes and splitting of the electronic states and manifest themselves in the optical absorption and emission spectra .",
    "empirically such interactions are dictated by factors such as covalency of the bonding with ligands as well as geometry of the ligand coordination , i.e.  number of bonds ( coordination number ) and the length / angle of bonds . the crystal field theory",
    "( cft ) @xcite is a well established tool for quantifying the ligand environment of localized @xmath0-electrons.@xcite beyond transition metal ions in optical materials , cft finds extensive applications in describing the electronic structure of @xmath5-electrons of lanthanide and actinide systems , @xcite including studies on magnetic anisotropy energies for permanent bulk- and single - molecule magnets .",
    "@xcite    the semi - empirical exchange charge model ( ecm ) @xcite has been successfully applied to transition metal ions in optical materials to calculate the crystal field parameters ( cfp ) .",
    "first - principles approaches,@xcite including wavefunction - based quantum chemical methods for molecules and clusters and the density functional theory ( dft ) , have the advantage of predicting cfps from first - principles without having to fit to experiment .",
    "@xcite however , they are often plagued by the following three technical challenges in the electronic structure of @xmath6-systems .",
    "( 1 ) lack of a fully self - consistent treatment of the @xmath6-charge density .",
    "( 2 ) lack of explicit consideration of strong on - site electronic correlation effects and self - interaction , which may severely impair the accuracy of obtained parameters .",
    "earlier , one of us developed a method to calculate crystal field splitting of lanthanide / actinide oxides @xcite using self consistent dft+@xmath7 @xcite calculations with aspherical self - interaction corrections,@xcite although many calculations of different electronic configurations are required to parametrize the cft model .",
    "recently novk and co - workers @xcite developed a dft - based approach using wannier wavefunctions and achieved considerable progress in predicting cfps of rare earth ions .",
    "@xcite in their approach the @xmath5-electrons were treated as core electrons in dft calculations and correlation effects were considered by introducing an adjustable parameter .",
    "( 3 ) moreover , compared to @xmath5-electrons , transition metal @xmath0-electrons hybridizes considerably more strongly with ligand @xmath8-electrons , resulting in broader @xmath0 bands and difficulty identifying the crystal field splitting .    in this paper",
    "we propose a fully _ ab initio _",
    "method for the cfps of transition metal dopants in optical host materials .",
    "we constrain the @xmath0-shell charge density to be spherical by a matrix of lagrange multipliers that act as a cancellation potential and effectively opposes the dft crystal field potential to produce a spherical @xmath0-shell distribution .",
    "all cfps are then solved for using a linear equation of the obtained lagrange multipliers .",
    "the opposing crystal potential ( ocp ) method is outlined below and applied to select semiconductors doped with mn@xmath1 and mn@xmath2 ions .",
    "finally , we will return to address the above questions before make conclusions .",
    "historically cfps have been defined prevalently in two different normalization conventions , the so - called stevens @xcite and wybourne    @xcite notations . in this paper",
    "we adopt the former one with steven s operators @xmath9 and the associated real - valued parameters @xmath10 .",
    "the matrix element @xmath11 of the crystal field potential @xmath12 is : @xmath13 where @xmath14 designates atomic orbitals ( e.g.  @xmath15 states ) , and @xmath16 s are real - valued spherical harmonics @xmath17 the einstein convention for repeated indices is used through the paper .",
    "alternatively , the wybourne notation adopt _ complex _ spherical harmonics @xmath18 and _ complex _ cfp @xmath10 to represent @xmath19 .    consider a transition - metal ion in a host material .",

    "the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath25 between the strongly correlated @xmath0 or @xmath5 electrons represents a formidable challenge for accurate electronic structure calculations .",
    "while the local density approximation ( lda ) and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) are well known for their qualitative failure in strongly correlated systems due to lack of consideration of on - site correlation , more advanced methods such as dft+@xmath7 @xcite provide explicit treatment of @xmath25 .",

    "@xcite brillouin zone integration was carried out on @xmath54-point meshes of at least @xmath55 with gaussian broadening of width 0.05 ev . unless otherwise specified , all internal coordinates of the supercells were relaxed using gga+@xmath7 to better treat possible jahn - teller structural distortions .",
    "we chose atomic basis functions @xmath14 represented by normalized , real - valued spherical harmonics @xcite and ignored spin - orbit coupling so that all matrices @xmath36 , @xmath35 and @xmath56 are real .",

    "the strong on - site coulomb interactions give rise to a charge - transfer band gap and sizable exchange splitting with the mn@xmath1 ion in the @xmath72 majority high - spin configuration .",

    "both empty @xmath69 and @xmath70 bands are so wide due to hybridization that they lie in approximate the same energy range above the fermi level , in contradiction to the conventional crystal field picture of clear - cut @xmath69-@xmath70 splitting . therefore it is infeasible to assign specific energies to these crystal field levels and extract cfps from kohn - sham eigen - energies .",
    "[ fig : srtio3-mn - dos]b shows the results from constrained non - spin polarized pbe calculations , where all five @xmath3 orbitals , including @xmath69 and @xmath70 , become equally occupied as the crystal potential is effectively canceled by the applied potential @xmath73 in eq .",

    "let s revisit the challenges of cfp calculations with dft outlined earlier and summarize our treatment :    1 .",
    "charge self - consistency .",
    "our ocp method is carried out fully self - consistently without freezing @xmath6-electrons into the core .",
    "the obtained cfps therefore directly correspond to the crystal environment that the ion experience given a spherical density matrix @xmath78 .",
    "since the main purpose of the crystal field model is to describe various excited states with completely different spin and charge distribution , our choice of a spherical , non - spin polarized reference distribution is justified as an _ unbiased average _ of @xmath4 configurations and validated by excellent agreement with experiment .",
    "2 .   on - site",
    "correlation effects .",
    "our approach does not explicitly depend on and to a large extent circumvents the complication of on - site correlation for @xmath0 or @xmath5-electrons , since any physical exchange - correlation yields a uniform potential shift in our method that gets absorbed into the spherical part ( @xmath37 ) of the crystal field .",
    "we were able to use local approximations ( lda , gga ) in this work , despite the expected deficiency of gga for strongly correlated materials .",
    "use of more advanced methods may potentially mildly improve the results .",
    "3 .   primarily for @xmath0-electrons , the difficulty in identifying @xmath0 bands due to strong @xmath0-@xmath8 hybridization .",
    "our method relies on the projected on - site occupancy , which are always well - defined , and does not suffer from the ill - defined assignment of broad energy bands to local @xmath0-states .",
    "our method for cfps assumes a spherical @xmath6-electron charge distribution , which remains reasonable as long as the charge distribution of the host marial is not significantly altered .",
    "for @xmath3 ions , the @xmath0-electrons are relatively localized and we expect this assumption to be valid . in systems with strong @xmath0-@xmath8 hybridization and more delocalized @xmath0-electrons , this assumption needs to be reassessed .",
    "however , in those cases the whole notion of the crystal field models is questionable and may have to be replaced by more elaborate theory anyway .    in summary",
    ", we developed a parameter - free _ ab initio _ method , the opposing crystal potential , for crystal field calculation based on constrained dft , with crystal field parameters extracted from the constraining lagrange multipliers , which effectively oppose the crystal field potential and yield spherical @xmath6-electron distribution .",
    "good agreement with experiment was demonstrated on transition metal ions mn@xmath1 and mn@xmath2 used in rare - earth free phosphors .",
    "the approach is highly efficient with approximate the same computational cost as conventional dft calculations times a small pre - factor towards convergence of the lagrange multipliers .",
    "it is equally applicable to crystals of low or high symmetry and can be readily implemented in general - purpose dft codes that support on - site non - local potentials ( e.g.  dft+@xmath7 ) .",
