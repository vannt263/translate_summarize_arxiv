    "during the first observing run of the advanced ligo detector ( from september 12 , 2015 to january 19 , 2016 ) , two black hole binary ( bbh ) mergers at cosmological distances were discovered .",
    "the individual ( source - frame ) black hole ( bh ) masses of the first event , labeled as gw150914 , are m@xmath2 m@xmath3 , m@xmath4 m@xmath3  @xcite . the second event ( gw151226 )",
    "consists of relatively less massive bhs of m@xmath5 m@xmath3and m@xmath6 m@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the estimated masses of final bhs formed by merging of two bhs are @xmath7 m@xmath3  ( gw150914 ) and @xmath8 m@xmath3  ( gw151226 ) , respectively .",
    "discoveries of gw150914 and gw151226 proved the existence of bhs in compact binaries .",
    "furthermore , gw150914 provides with observational evidences for bhs with masses between @xmath9 m@xmath3 which is significantly larger than the estimated bh masses in galactic x - ray binaries ( e.g. , tanaka 2000 ) . with",
    "two confirmed detections and one bbh candidate ( lvt151012 ) , however , the observations have not provided constraints for the origins of known bbhs @xcite or bh mass distribution @xcite .",
    "many authors have attempted to explain the formation and evolution of bbhs based on a standard massive binary evolution scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "after the detection of gw150914 , different ideas were suggested such as chemically homogeneous evolutionary channels for bbhs @xcite , primordial bhs as progenitors of gw150914 @xcite and the roles of population ii bbhs @xcite .",
    "alternatively , dynamical processes in dense stellar systems such as globular clusters ( gcs ) have been suggested ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite performed monte carlo simulations for gcs and studied evolution of bbhs and bh properties .",
    "they obtained bbh merger rate of @xmath10 gpc@xmath1 yr @xmath0 in the local universe , mentioning that their estimated rate can be decreased if significant natal kicks are exerted on bh populations in the cluster .",
    "one of the interesting implications of their work is that the majority of bbhs would have mass ranges between @xmath11 m@xmath3 , and the contribution of cluster - origin bbhs would be roughly 14 per cent among the all _ merging _ bbhs in the local universe . adapting similar monte - carlo models ,",
    "@xcite examined how different initial assumptions affect the cluster s evolution and properties of bh populations .",
    "they concluded that initial mass function , stellar wind , natal kicks are most important factors to affect the number of bbhs or properties of bh populations formed in clusters .    recent work by @xcite examined properties of bhs and neutron star ( ns ) populations by using a nbody6 code . in particular , the authors took into account natal kicks for bhs between 0 and 100 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "they found that the cluster properties such as number density of stars and relaxation time - scale @xcite affect the properties of bbhs formed in the cluster significantly .",
    "in addition , @xcite examined bhs in dense stellar clusters applying the latest n - body simulation code ( nbody7 ) with post - newtonian corrections in orbit calculations . taken into account different cluster masses , metallicities , stellar wind and evolution scenaria , and half - mass radius sizes corresponding to young massive and starburst clusters , the authors concluded that many bbh mergers could take place within the cluster .",
    "one of the simplifications made by many n - body simulations is the assumption of a fixed - mass for all bhs : typical choice is 10 m@xmath3  motivated from the average mass of observed bhs from galacic x - ray binaries however , population synthesis works predict that a bh mass distribution can range about @xmath12 m@xmath3 .",
    "similar to discs of galaxies , gcs are also expected to contain bhs with a wide range of masses .",
    "there are attempts to include stellar evolution and/or bh mass distribution in n - body simulations .",
    "for example , @xcite examined the effects of bh mass distribution in cluster dynamics , utilizing a prescription for binary evolution included in nbody4 with modifications for mass losses of massive stars at supernova explosions following @xcite .",
    "the bh mass function used in @xcite spans from 5 to 20 m@xmath3  with a peak at about 4 m@xmath3 , which is relatively narrower than what was suggested for disc populations .",
    "this work is a follow - up of bae et al .",
    "( 2014 , paper i hereafter ) .",
    "paper i investigated properties of ns - ns and bbhs formed in and ejected from clusters by n - body simulations .",
    "the main conclusions of paper i are : ( a ) significant fraction of bhs are ejected from a cluster after core collapse and about 30 per cent of ejected bhs are in binaries , ( b ) the merger rate of ejected bbhs per a cluster is @xmath13 gyr@xmath0 .",
    "this corresponds to a detection rate of @xmath14 yr@xmath0 for the advanced ligo - virgo network .",
    "ns - bh binary is not likely to be formed in a cluster . in this work ,",
    "we focus on bbhs formed in gcs , considering two - component and continuous bh mass functions .",
    "the organization of this work is as follows . in  [ section : bbh ] , we describe the evolution of bhs in a cluster qualtitatively . in ",
    "[ section : model ] , we present our models and assumptions .",
    "the results of our simulations are summarized in ",
    "[ section : results ] .",
    "lastly , we discuss implications of results in  [ section : discussion ] .",
    "bhs are formed by the evolution of stars more massive than  20 @xmath15 ( e.g. , mirabel 2017 ) whose lifetime is expected to be shorter than @xmath16 yrs .",
    "considering the fact that most of the milky way ( mw ) gcs are older than 10 gyr , the formation of bhs took place during very early phase of the evolution of a cluster .",
    "as soon as bhs are formed , therefore , they become most massive components within a cluster that is still young .",
    "bhs segregate into the cluster core due to dynamical friction then form a dense bh subsystems in time - scale rather quickly ( e.g.  lee 1995 , 2001a ; breen & heggie 2013 ) .",
    "the bh subsystem in the central part then undergoes core collapse rapidly , further increasing the core density composed of bhs .",
    "frequent close encounters among bhs are expected to take place in the core , including formation of bbhs and their interactions with surrounding stars .    in order to form binaries ,",
    "orbital energy of two nearby stars has to be taken away .",
    "this can happen either via dissipative or non - dissipative processes .",
    "for extended stars such as main - sequence stars or giants the orbital energy can be transformed into internal energy via tidal interactions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for the case of compact stars such as nss and bhs , gravitational waves ( gws ) emitted during close encounters can be only possibility of dissipating orbital energy ( e.g. , quinlan & shapiro 1989 ) .",
    "the non - dissipative process for the formation of binaries requires a temporary triple system which eventually becomes a bound system of two stars by ejecting the third star at high velocity .",
    "this is called binary formation by a three - body process .",
    "the direct capture rate per unit volume between two identical stars with mass @xmath17 and number density @xmath18 can be expressed as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the capture cross section , @xmath21 is a relative velocity of two approaching stars , and the brackets represent an average taken over a given velocity distribution .",
    "the gravitational radiation capture cross section has been obtained for using post - newtonian approximation following @xcite . for two identical stars , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the speed of light .",
    "the binary formation rate via three - body processes has been obtained by @xcite as follows , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the system and @xmath26 .    assuming that @xmath27 , the ratio between gravitational radiation capture and binaryformation by three - body processes can be obtained from eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 3 ) . @xmath28",
    "now , clusters with @xmath25 greater than 10 @xmath29 are rare . even for clusters with @xmath25 greater than 10 @xmath29",
    ", the velocity dispersion of bhs will be smaller than that of stars whose masses are much smaller than bhs .",
    "of course , bhs that are less massive than 10 m@xmath3  could form binaries via gravitational radiation .",
    "also the gravitational radiation capture could be efficient , if the stellar density is much lower than @xmath30 .",
    "we note that , however , binary formation rate in a low density environment would be low regardless of the nature of processes available in a cluster . in short",
    ", we expect that most bbhs formed by dynamical processes would have gone through ( multiple ) three - body interactions in typical gc conditions .",
    "next we consider the orbital evolution of binaries formed by three - body interactions .",
    "once a binary is formed , it can interact with surrounding stars rather frequently since the effective cross section becomes larger for binaries .",
    "close encounters between a single star and a binary are defined as those with the pericenter approach of an order of the semi - major axis of a binary . for each encounter ,",
    "let s assume some fraction of binding energy of a binary is transformed into translational energies of participating members , i.e. , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the semi - major axis of the binary and @xmath33 is the fraction of energy extracted from a binary . through these processes",
    "a binary becomes tighter and tighter if the binary is ` hard ' , i.e.  @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath25 are the binary s orbital velocity and velocity dispersion of surrounding stars , respectively .",
    "in contrast , if a bbh is dynamically soft , the binary would be resolved into two single bhs via interactions with another bh .",
    "since the absolute value of the binding energy becomes larger during hardening process , the binary as well as the single star gain more translational energy and eventually get ejected from the cluster , if the binary s recoil velocity becomes larger than the cluster s escape velocity @xmath36 .",
    "typically , the mean velocity of ejected bbhs is about 1.8 times of @xmath36 ( see fig .  8 in paper",
    "i for a velocity distribution of ejected binaries at the tidal radius normalised by @xmath36 ) . assuming that the net linear momentum relative to the cluster s center of mass motion remains to be zero during and after the binary - single interaction and @xmath37 @xcite , the condition for a binary s critical semi - major axis at ejection",
    "can be written as follows :    @xmath38    we can see that the binary s orbit is quite tight when it is ejected .",
    "the orbit of an initially tight binary further decreases ( slowly ) by the emission of gws .",
    "whether the binary will get ejected or merge within the cluster is determined by the comparison between typical time - scale for binary - single encounter and the gw induced merger . for typical physical parameters for gcs ,",
    "the binary - single encounter time - scale is shorter than gw induced merger time - scale@xcite .",
    "thus we may assume that the bbhs in gcs get ejected from the cluster with typical semi - major axis given by eq .",
    "( [ acrit ] ) and undergo passive evolution afterward outside of the cluster by emitting gws . in the following sections , we confirm that bbhs formed in gcs indeed follow the evolutionary path as outlined above .",
    "for n - body simulations , we utilize code @xcite with graphical processing units ( gpus ) on nvidia tesla c2075 platforms or nvidia tesla c1060 platforms . n - body simulation is computation - intensive .",
    "one of the main limitations of n - body approach is the maximum number of stars that can be realized .",
    "the number of stars in a mw gc is typically @xmath39 .",
    "n - body simulations are often based on a simplified cluster model with a smaller number of particles , @xmath40(@xmath41 ) up to millions presented by recent work @xcite .",
    "the purpose of our work is not to perform n - body simulations with realistic modeling of gcs .",
    "instead , we attempt to obtain statistically robust results on the characteristics of bbhs as a function of global properties of clusters . we still need a large number of stars in simulations , in order to avoid statistical fluctuations .",
    "we repeat @xmath42 10 simulations per model with @xmath43 or @xmath44 , so that we can reduce statistical fluctuations significantly . for a given model ,",
    "all parameters are fixed and only random seed numbers are different per each run .",
    "we use similar conditions used in paper i for controlling initial and environmental conditions in our simulations ( see section 2 in paper i for details ) .",
    "we use a king model for an initial density profile of a cluster @xcite with a fixed concentration parameter @xmath45 .",
    "the cluster is laid on a static external tidal field created from a point mass galaxy at 8.5 kpc distance and 220 km  s@xmath0 circular velocity .    as discussed in ",
    "[ section : bbh ] , we only consider three - body processes in this work .",
    "stellar evolution and primordial binaries are not included ; paper i showed that cluster dynamics with bhs , except for time - scale of the evolution itself , are not sensitive to different assumptions on the concentration parameter or primordial binary fractions ( see their figs .  4 and 5 ) . moreover , some binary properties are insensitive to the particle number of n - body simulations .",
    "examples of such properties include eccentricity , hardness , and velocity distributions of ejected binaries ( figs .",
    "6 - 8 in paper i ) .",
    "we can use those number independent parameters to investigate the dynamically formed binary populations .",
    "we use a reference parameter set used in paper i , except using different bh mass functions .    @llcccc model & @xmath46 , @xmath47 & @xmath48 : @xmath49 & bh mass fraction + name & ( m@xmath3 ) & & ( per cent ) + a1 & 10 , 20 & 2:1 & 2.5 + a2 & & 5:1 & 2.5 + a3 & & 2:1 & 5.0 + a4 & & 5:1 & 5.0 + a5 & & 2:1 & 1.35 + a6 & & 5:1 & 1.35 +   + b1 & 5 , 10 & 2:1 & 2.5 + b2 & & 5:1 & 2.5 + b3 & & 2:1 & 5.0 + b4 & & 5:1 & 5.0 +      in addition to normal stars ( 0.7 m@xmath3 ) , we assume there are bhs with different masses in the cluster from the beginning of the simulations . in this work",

    "we adopt a rapid supernova explosion model that can successfully reproduce the mass gap observed between nss and bhs ( the lack of compact objects in @xmath61 m@xmath3  range ; belczynski et al .",

    "first , most massive components in the cluster form binaries .",
    "then , ejection of binaries begins to take place right after the formation of the first binary .",
    "it means that hardening of binary orbits is a rapid process ( more rapid than the binary formation time - scale ) .",
    "not only binaries but also single bhs are ejected from the cluster since the recoil energy during a binary - single encounter is shared by the binaries and singles .",
    "if all bh masses in a cluster are the same , the recoil velocity of a single bh is expected to be twice of that of a binary .",
    "this implies that the number of single bhs ejected from a cluster is larger than that of binaries . indeed , paper i found that only 30 per cent of the ejected bhs is belonged to binaries while the rest ( 70 per cent ) are single bhs .    except for quantitative details ,",
    "lower - mass bhs follow similar paths that we described earlier for higher - mass bhs such as mass segregation , binary - single ( i.e. , three - body ) interaction , and ejection from the cluster after most of the higher - mass bh get ejected in the form of either binaries or singles .",
    "in addition to those discussed in the paper i such as cumulative numbers of ejected binaries , hardness distribution , and the ratio of merging binaries with respect to the all ejected binaries ( figs . 4 , 7 , 9 in the paper i ) , we examine number and mass ratios between bbhs with different masses in this work .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : formej ] , we compare cumulative number distributions of different bbh populations as a function of time ( in units of the cluster s initial relaxation time - scale @xmath65 ) . here",

    "the formation and ejection of bbhs occur hierarchically with respect to their masses .",
    "the highest - mass binaries ( @xmath70 m@xmath3 , red curves ) are formed first at the early phase of the cluster s evolution ( less than a few @xmath65 ) .",
    "when the highest - mass bbh populations are nearly completely ejected from the cluster , the next massive binaries ( @xmath71 m@xmath3 ) are formed and ejected ( green curves ) .",
    "lastly , the lowest - mass bbhs ( @xmath72 m@xmath3 ) are formed and ejected ( blue curves ) .",

    "note that there is nearly a constant time gap between all bbhs ( black dashed lines ) and ejected binaries ( black solid lines ) .",
    "this time gap can be interpreted as a typical lifetime of a bbh spent in the cluster before ejection .",
    "if we wait long , almost all bbhs are ejected from the cluster and the black solid and dashed lines asymptotically converge ( with one or two binaries left in the cluster ) .",
    "however , our results show that the total number of binaries formed in the cluster is slightly larger by a few than that of ejected .",
    "this is presumably attributed to dissolved binaries as bbhs are formed and dissolved through multiple three - body interactions .",
    "the fraction of dissolved binaries comprises less than 3 per cent of the total bbhs formed in a cluster .",

    "if the total mass ratio between the two bh populations are larger ( i.e. , model bs with @xmath73 ) , more unequal - mass bbhs can be produced because of the shorter time gap between mass segregations of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",

    "the merger fraction estimated from ejected binaries can slightly affect the merger rate .",
    "since the discrepancies between @xmath102 curves are not significantly large , we may expect that the gw sources will be more weighted toward the higher masses .",
    "in addition , the horizon distances for higher - mass bbhs are larger by approximately a factor of binary s mass ratio , we may expect to detect higher - mass binaries more frequently than simple expectation from a bh mass function . in that sense , surprisingly large bh masses estimated from gw150914 would not be a simple coincidence .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : delay ] , we plot histogram of delay times for ejected , merging bbhs .",
    "the delay time of a binary can be defined by the duration between the epoch of ejection of a binary from a cluster and the merger event . in this work ,",
    "a binary s delay time is essentially the merger time - scale we described earlier .",
    "we show results for specific values of @xmath123 and 10 km  s@xmath0 in the upper panel , respectively .",
    "the shape of the delay time distribution is nearly independent of @xmath98 .",
    "the mean delay time decreases for a cluster with larger central velocity . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : merge ] , only some fraction of ejected binaries are to merge within a hubble time for a typical velocity dispersion observed from mw gcs . in fig .",
    "[ fig : delay ] , the peak is located at @xmath124 hubble time . among the merging binaries ,",
    "at least a few per cent of ejected binaries are expected to merge within @xmath125 yrs , much quicker than others .",
    "we also point out that , although it is not impossible , only very few binaries would merge within a cluster .",
    "we may safely assume that majority of mergers takes place _ outside _ of the cluster .",
    "considering results obtained from models listed in table 1 , based on two - component bh mass functions , we calculate bbh merger rate @xmath126 ( per gc per gyr ) and rate volume density @xmath127 ( per gpc@xmath128 per yr ) , where @xmath129 , @xmath130 is the specific number density of gcs per galaxy .",
    "following paper i , we assume @xmath131 and adopt @xmath132 @xcite . for all models considered in this work ,",
    "we obtain @xmath133 gyr@xmath0 per gc .",
    "this is similar to reference results from paper i based on the similar set of parameters .",
    "recall that we ignore primordial binaries and assume the bh mass fraction of @xmath134 in this work .",
    "we find that assumptions on mass in a two - component bh mass function within a factor two , i.e. , ( 5,10 ) m@xmath3  versus ( 10,20 ) m@xmath3 , does not affect to rate estimates .",
    "the corresponding rate volume density from our result is @xmath135 @xmath136 .",
    "we note that the estimated merger rate in this work is likely to be a lower limit because of our very conservative assumptions .",
    "the gc population we see today in the milky way could be only a small fraction of initial cluster populations since many clusters could have been disrupted by various reasons ( e.g. , lee & ostriker 1995 , gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "these disrupted gc population could have produced significant number of bbhs as comparible as those from observed clusters .",
    "furthermore , many gcs are formed in low metallicity environments where stellar mass function could have been more weighted toward higher - mass stars , i.e. , top - heavy mass function suggested by marks et al .",
    "in addition , the existence of primordial ( tight ) binaries can also increase bbh merger rate .",
    "our main assumptions are similar to the reference model in paper i. we note that paper i argued that the actual merger rate of bbhs formed and ejected from clusters can be up to four times higher than their rate estimates obtained from the reference model .     of the cluster .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) present delay time distributions assuming @xmath98 = 5 and 10 km  s@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "panel ( c ) shows a delay time distribution for ejected , merging bbhs from all models , averaged by the observed @xmath98 of mw gcs.the pink dashed vertical line indicates a hubble time ( 13.7 gyr).,height=283 ]      let us emphasize two important lessons from the two - component models for bhs in gcs .",
    "one is that the dynamical process favours the formation of equal - mass binaries and the other is that the formation efficiency for higher - mass bbhs is larger than lower - mass populations . in reality , however , a continuous mass distribution for bhs would be expected in a cluster .",
    "the main uncertainty is the range and shape of the distribution . as an expansion of our study , we investigate the dynamical evolution of bhs formed in gcs , assuming a continuous bh mass function generated by population synthesis .",
    "the bh mass functions obtained from ejected binaries ( blue histograms in fig .  [ fig : inej ] ) are multimodal , and most prominent peaks are found at around @xmath137 m@xmath3 . for both metallicities ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) , the initial bh mass ranges are between 5 and 41.5 m@xmath3 .",
    "efficient formation of higher - mass bbhs is apparent from lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : inej ] . in our simulations , the bh formation rate for 40 m@xmath3",
    "bh is about 3 times higher than that of 10 m@xmath3  bbhs for both metallicity cases .",
    "this means that the mass function derived from gw data alone would be highly skewed toward a upper end , compared to the actual bh mass function .",
    "similar to two - component mass models , formation of nearly equal - mass bbhs are strongly preferred by continuous bh mass functions ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cont ] ) .",
    "our results show that most bbhs formed and ejected from a cluster have a mass ratio @xmath138 less than 2 . among those ejected and merging bbhs ,",
    "only 6 per cent of them have @xmath139 .",
    "now , the mass ratio of known bbh is 1.2 ( gw150914 ) and 1.9 ( gw151226 ) , respectively .",
    "since estimation of individual masses from gw observation has substantial errors , we can not say whether these two observations are consistent with dynamical binaries based on the mass ratio only .",
    "however , as the number of detected sources increase the statistical errors would decrease .",
    "compact binaries are important sources of gws . in a dense stellar environment like gcs",
    ", compact binaries consisting of nss and bhs can be formed by dynamical processes . in this work ,",
    "we expand the scope from paper i and examine the evolution of bbhs with various bh mass distributions in a gc .    for all cluster models",
    ", we have assumed that bhs and ordinary stars follow the same form of initial density profiles . in reality ,",
    "density profiles of more massive components ( i.e.  bhs ) could have been more centrally concentrated than lower mass components .",
    "however , the difference between the evolutions of initially mass - segregated clusters and un - segregated clusters is likely to be negligible , as the time - scale for bh mass segregation would be rather short . in general",
    ", the evolution of gcs can be described as follows .",
    "the most massive component in the system rapidly loses its energy and sinks toward the central part of the cluster through dynamical friction . this mass segregation time - scale is shorter than the cluster s relaxation time by a factor of @xmath140 , where @xmath141 and @xmath142 are the highest component s mass and the mean mass of all stars , respectively",
    "( see for example , lee 1995 , 2001a ) . in our models ,",
    "bhs are more massive than ordinary stars by large factors . after mass segregation ,",
    "the central part of a cluster is dominated by the highest - mass population .",
    "close interactions among highest - mass components lead to the formation of binaries .    , left ) and",
    "belc01 ( @xmath143 , right ) .",
    "black solid lines refer to the initial bh mass function that are randomly sampled from original results obtained by population synthesis ( red lines ) .",
    "blue solid lines stand for histograms of bh masses obtained from ejected binaries .",
    "all histograms are plotted with a 2-m@xmath3  bin .",
    "lower panels : ratio between the number of each mass bin read from the ejected ( blue ) and initial ( black ) population with error bars @xmath144 .",
    "the ratios are plotted with a 6-m@xmath3  bin for simplicity.,height=257 ]     ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "the results are obtained from continuous bh mass functions ( belc01 and belc001 ) as described in the text . as expected , equal - mass bbhs are dominant .",
    "some bbhs do have mass ratios between @xmath146 . ]    typically , the time in n - body simulations is normalised by the cluster s initial half - mass relaxation time @xmath147(0 ) .",
    "for instance , the time @xmath148 in fig",
    ".  1 is normalised by @xmath147(0 ) . following @xcite , the half - mass relaxation time of a cluster",
    "is defined as @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the half - mass radius of a cluster .",
    "@xmath151 is the total number of stars .",
    "@xmath152 is the average mass of all stars in the cluster and @xmath153 is adapted from @xcite as described in paper i.    we assume that the variation of @xmath147 is very mild at least in the context of our simulations . in the early phase of a cluster , @xmath147 increases slowly because of the expansion of the cluster due to the heating effect of the bbh .",
    "however , as the cluster loses mass @xmath147 decreases slowly .",
    "overall , we may assume that @xmath147 remains nearly constant within a factor of two .",
    "known gcs in the milky way have diverse values of @xmath147 , ranging from @xmath154 to more than @xmath155 yrs , with a median value being around @xmath156 yrs .",
    "this means that the time - scale for complete depletion of bhs in gcs also varies from cluster to cluster .",
    "our simulation is attempted to establish gcs at present based on observations .",
    "bh depletion could have occured earlier in the gc s evolution .",
    "the binary - single encounters that lead to the hardening and ejection of binaries take place in dynamical time .",
    "the relaxation time of a gc is proportional to @xmath157 , where @xmath151 is the number of stars and @xmath158 is the dynamical time - scale of the cluster .",
    "since our @xmath151 used in simulations is much smaller than actual number of stars in clusters , the difference between relaxation time and dynamical time is smaller than actual cluster environments . in our simulations ,",
    "the binaries are ejected after the formation in about @xmath159 relaxation time - scale .",
    "if the number of stars were larger than our simulations , the time gap between binary formation and ejection would have been shorter than our results ( as shown in fig .  1 ) .",
    "our simulations indicate that the complete ejection of bhs is about 20 @xmath147(0 ) but the actual ejection could require shorter amount of time .",
    "we note that the @xmath160 @xmath147(0 ) is the expected lifetime of clusters in steady tidal field ( e.g. , henon 1961 , lee & ostriker 1987 ) .",
    "the cluster s lifetime can be shortened significantly by the presence of stellar mass function @xcite or tidal shocks ( e.g. , gnedin , lee , & ostriker 1999 ) .",
    "the initial rotation of the clusters also accelerate the time to core collapse by factors of several @xcite , as well as the cluster s lifetime @xcite . in view of such possibilities",
    ", we may assume that the clusters expected lifetime would be 10 @xmath147(0 ) or short .    as a corollary",
    ", we also expect that bhs would have been completely ejected from a cluster if its @xmath147 is relatively short ( i.e. , @xmath161 yrs ) .",
    "clusters with sufficiently long @xmath147 could still contain a substantial number of bhs either in the forms of binaries or singles .",
    "considering the simplifications made in this work , it is not impossible that some clusters can harbour bhs that are more massive than the maximum bh mass expected from mass star evolution .",
    "that is , in some clusters , bbhs are formed in a very early phase of the cluster . if the bbhs consist of the highest - mass bhs in the cluster and if the binary is hard enough , the binaries can have chances to merger via emitting gws within the cluster unless the recoil velocity during the merger is larger than @xmath36 .",
    "it is known that the majority of massive stars including bh progenitors are in binaries ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in paper",
    "i , the authors varies the number of ejected bbhs from a cluster varying the fraction of primordial binaries from zero per cent up to 50 per cent .",
    "they found no significant differences in results ( see figure 5 in the paper i ) .",
    "based on their results in the paper i , the authors concluded that bbh properties ( examined by n - body simulations ) are not sensitive to primordial binary fraction .",
    "@xcite also found outcomes from monte - carlo simulations have barely changed by different primordial binary fractions . in the present work ,",
    "we consider a conservative assumption that all clusters have single bhs initially .",
    "our n - body simulations take into account only newtonian prescriptions of binary orbits .",
    "therefore , gravitational radiation capture ( two - body process ) is not included in this work , hence , all binaries are formed by three - body processes .",
    "if post - newtonian corrections are taken into account in n - body simulation , there could be rare cases of binaries formed by two - body processes similar to what described in @xcite .",
    "these binaries are likely to be formed in the central region of a galaxy , where stellar number density is significantly higher and stars can have larger velocity dispersions than those in gcs . if a gc would have high enough central number density , some bbhs can be formed by two - body interactions capture as well as three - body interactions .",
    "binaries formed by two - body processes are particularly interesting gw sources because their orbits could be extremely eccentric : typically @xmath162 at the time of formation .",
    "the eccentricities decrease rapidly during the inspiral phase , but significant amount of eccentricity would remain when the gravitational wave frequency enters the detectors sensitive band .",
    "such a possibility was discussed in detail by oleary et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and hong & lee ( 2015 ) in the context of galactic nuclei star clusters .",
    "observation of eccentric merger from ground based detectors would suggest the presence of the captured binaries , although we expect that they would be very rare .    gw observations of bbhs will provide information on underlyaing properties such as spins and masses . we ignore the effects of kicks in this work . for heavy bhs considered in this work , natal kicks from supernova explosions are most likely to be small or negligeable as predicted by theoretical works ( e.g. fyer et al .  2012 ) .",
    "however , based on em or gw observations , low - to - moderate natal kicks ( @xmath163 km s@xmath0 ) even for massive bhs can not yet be excluded ( e.g. , belczynski et al .",
    "2016a ; 2016c ) in order to constrain the kinematics of the bbhs , multiple and precise spin measurements from gw detections will be important .",
    "dynamical interactions in gcs can produce highly spinning bhs that are bound with an another bh . if spins are aligned with the binary s orbital angular momentum it points out to the field origin .",
    "however , the origin of bbhs with significant spin misalignement would be hard to determine the origin of the binary .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , gw150914 could have been formed either in isolated evolution of low - metallicity binary system or in a dense gc . with the prospects of observation",
    "runs 2 and 3 , the advanced ligo will find more gw sources .",
    "the advanced virgo would be soon up and running to search the gw sky as well .",
    "the first gw source catalogue is likely to be dominated by bbhs .",
    "gw detections with the advanced ligo - virgo detector network will provide an empirical mass distribution for bh populations up to cosmological distances .",
    "more detections , in particular for heavy bbhs ( with good mass estimates ) , will allow us to discriminate assumptions on bh mass functions and the plausibility of clusters as bbh factories .",
    "in particular , if bhs with mass above pair - instability pulsation supernovae limit ( @xmath164 m@xmath3 ; belczynski et al .",
    "2016 ) are found in merging binaries , it would be most likely to be produced by mergers between stellar - mass bbhs .",
    "the existence of heavier bhs with a few hundred solar mass can only be explained by stellar interactions in dense stellar environments .",
    "gw observations of bbhs will be useful to understand how different bh populations are formed and evolved in different environments .",
    "precise measurements of individual spins and masses will be important to understand underlying properties of bbhs .",
    "bbhs . if accessible , electromagnetic wave observations of host galaxies of known bbhs would provide constraints to discriminate different bbh formation and evolution channels .",
