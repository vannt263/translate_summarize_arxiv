    "it is generally accepted that disk galaxies have massive dark halos , but little is known about the shape of the dark matter halos .",
    "dark halos were generally modeled as being spherical until binney ( 1978 ) argued that the natural shape of dark halos is triaxial .",
    "if halos are indeed triaxial , the disk of the galaxy will reside in one of the principal planes of the dark halo . in a triaxial halo",
    "the axes obey the relation @xmath8 .",
    "i will assume that the disks of spiral galaxies lie within the @xmath9 plane .",
    "triaxial dark matter halos occur naturally in cosmological n - body simulations of structure formation in the universe ( katz & gunn 1991 , dubinski & carlberg 1991 , dubinski 1994 ) , but the exact distribution of the halo shapes is as yet uncertain .",
    "especially the inclusion of baryons in the simulations tends to make the halos more oblate ( dubinski 1994 ) .",
    "so the observed distribution of the shapes of dark matter halos will be a powerful constraint on scenarios of galaxy formation and subsequent evolution .",
    "measuring the shapes of dark halos can be split into two parts : measurement of the ratio @xmath10 , i.e. the flattening perpendicular to the plane of the disk , and measurement of the intermediate to major axis ratio @xmath11 , i.e. the elongation in the plane of the disk .",
    "the axis ratio @xmath10 can be measured using , for instance , polar ring galaxies ( e.g. whitmore , mcelroy & schweizer 1987 , sackett & sparke 1990 , sackett _ et al _ 1994 ) , kinematics of halo stars of the milky way ( van der marel 1991 ) or the flaring of hi - disks ( olling , these proceedings , sicking 1996 ) .",
    "all these measurements seem to indicate that @xmath12 , in other words , a spherical halo is excluded by these measurements .",
    "the elongation of the dark halo ( @xmath11 ) is a similarly uncertain parameter .",
    "attempts to measure this quantity include studies of the inclination distributions of large samples of spiral galaxies and fitting models with different elongations to them ( lambas 1992 , binney & de vaucouleurs 1981 , fasano _ et al _ 1992 ) , detailed observations of the old stellar disks of spiral galaxies ( rix & zaritsky 1995 ) , kinematics of the milky way ( kuijken & tremaine 1994 ) and the scatter in the tully  fisher relation ( franx & de zeeuw 1992 ) .",
    "all these measurements indicate that @xmath13 .",
    "the only direct measurement of the elongation of the potential of a disk galaxy so far is of the s0 galaxy ic  2006 ( franx , van gorkom & de zeeuw 1994 , hereafter fvgdz ) , which contains a large hi ring in the plane of the disk . using information on both the kinematics and the geometry of the ring , fvgdz were able to measure the elongation of the potential at the location of the ring .",
    "the measured elongation was consistent with zero .",
    "the method used by fvgdz was based on the assumption that one could use epicycle theory to predict the geometry and velocity field of the ring in a mildly perturbed potential .",
    "if the external potential is elongated , the velocity variation along the ring will not be precisely sinusoidal , but higher harmonic terms will be superimposed on it . making a harmonic expansion of the velocity field of the ring and interpreting the measured harmonics within the framework of epicycle theory , given the ring geometry ,",
    "the elongation of the potential at the position of the ring can be found .",
    "i have extended the fvgdz formalism for measuring the elongation of the potential of a single orbit gas ring to the case of a slightly non - axisymmetric gas disk , which may contain spiral - like perturbations .",
    "this analysis assumes a stationary perturbation and closed stable orbits .",
    "therefore , applicability to non - linear phenomena like spiral arms is limited .",
    "but a small global elongation of the overall potential , as is the case with a triaxial dark matter halo , can be analysed with this method .",
    "the advantage of this method over previous attempts to derive the elongation of dark matter halos is that , by using hi , we can probe the potential at radii beyond the stellar disk , into the regime where the dark matter is thought to be the dominant dynamical component .",
    "suppose the ( cold ) hi - disk resides in a potential @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are polar coordinates in a frame that rotates with the perturbation , at a pattern speed @xmath17 . here , @xmath18 is the unperturbed potential , @xmath19 the amplitude of the perturbation and @xmath20 its phase .",
    "the perturbation is assumed to be stationary .",
    "one can calculate the possible closed loop orbits of the gas in this potential ( analogous to binney & tremaine , 1987 , p. 146 ) . subsequently one can determine the velocity field generated by these orbits",
    ". now assume that this velocity field is observed under viewing angles ( @xmath21 ) , where @xmath4 is the angle between the line where @xmath22 and the projection of the line - of - sight onto the plane of the disk and @xmath23 is the inclination of the disk . if one then introduces the azimuthal angle @xmath24 ( the angle in the plane of the disk that is zero on the line of nodes ) , it is possible to show that the velocity field projected on the sky ( hereafter `` line - of - sight velocity field '' or `` l.o.s .  velocity field '' ) has the following form ( express the line - of - sight velocity as a fourier expansion @xmath25 ) : @xmath26,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the circular velocity ) and coefficients @xmath29 that depend on @xmath30 , @xmath4 , @xmath31 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath17 .",
    "now the measurable parameters ( @xmath32 ) are expressed in terms of internal parameters for a potential perturbed by a single fourier term .    from equation ( [ lineofsight ] )",
    "we can conclude that _ if the potential has a perturbation of fourier number @xmath30 , the l.o.s .",
    "velocity field contains @xmath33 and @xmath34 fourier terms_. qualitatively , this conclusion was also inferred by canzian ( 1993 ) .    in order to measure the harmonic terms in the l.o.s .",
    "velocity field , we first fit a set of tilted - rings to the l.o.s .",
    "velocity field using standard tilted - ring fitting routines .",
    "then the velocity along each ring is decomposed into its harmonics . in general , one does not a priori know the inclination @xmath23 , position angle @xmath35 and centre ( @xmath36 ) of a galaxy . since the l.o.s .",
    "velocity field itself is used to determine these parameters , it is clear that this can influence the resulting harmonic terms .",
    "fvgdz showed that this fitting of the ring parameters from the l.o.s velocity field will affect the expansion given in equation ( [ lineofsight ] ) due to a possible difference between the best fitting parameters ( @xmath23 and @xmath35 ) and the true parameters .",
    "it can be shown that only for @xmath37 there will be first order differences between the best fitting and true internal parameters , whereas for @xmath38 , equation ( [ lineofsight ] ) predicts the correct form of the l.o.s .",
    "velocity field to second order . in the @xmath37 case",
    ", a misfit of the kinematic centre will result in additional @xmath39 and @xmath40 terms in the harmonic expansion and misfitting of the inclination or position angle will affect the @xmath41 and @xmath42 terms .    in the case of a globally elongated potential , as caused by for instance a triaxial halo , we have @xmath37 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "note that here we are in the @xmath37 case , where the best fitting @xmath23 and @xmath35 are not equal to the true @xmath23 and @xmath35 . assuming a flat rotation curve , one finds that after a tilted - ring fit the l.o.s .",
    "velocity field has the following form ( as derived earlier by fvgdz ) : @xmath45 with @xmath46    \\epsilon_r \\sin 2\\phi_{obs } , \\nonumber \\\\     \\hat c_3 & = & 0 , \\\\    \\hat s_3 & = &    v_c \\sin i \\left [ -      { { ( 1-q^2)(3q^2 + 1)}\\over{(3q^2 + 1)^2+(1-q^2)^2}}\\right ]    \\epsilon _ r \\sin 2\\phi_{obs } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the angle in the plane of the ring ( @xmath48 is zero on the apparent major axis of the ring ) , @xmath3 is equal to the elongation of the potential and .",
    "we see that from the @xmath49 and @xmath50 terms we are able to derive @xmath2 , the quantity that i will try to measure .",
    "unfortunately , one can not determine @xmath4 separately , so the combination of viewing angle and ellipticity is all one can determine for an individual galaxy .",
    "global ellipticity will create @xmath0 and @xmath1 terms that are _ constant _ with radius ( and thus @xmath2 will be constant as a function of radius as well ) , whereas spiral - like perturbances will cause @xmath0 and @xmath1 terms that change sign as a function of radius and @xmath51 will wiggle .",
    "therefore , i will interpret an average value of @xmath52 that is offset from zero as due to ellipticity of the disk .",
    "strong warping will invalidate the approach discussed above .",
    "in order to clarify the equations presented in section 2 , we present    [ figexample ]    a number of example potential perturbations and corresponding residual velocity fields in figure [ 1 ] .",
    "the harmonic terms of the different potential perturbations range from @xmath53 to @xmath54 . for the phase of the fields , @xmath20",
    ", we chose a logarithmic spiral .",
    "the amplitude of the perturbation has been taken constant throughout the field .",
    "the l.o.s .",
    "velocity fields are then created using equation ( [ lineofsight ] ) ( these are not shown ) . a tilted - ring fit",
    "was then made to these l.o.s .",
    "velocity fields and subsequently the harmonic fit was made , revealing the two harmonic components that were hidden in them .    in figure",
    "[ 1 ] we see from left to right    1 .   the @xmath30 term potential perturbation .",
    "2 .   the residual velocity field ( velocity field minus fitted circular velocity ) caused by this potential perturbation ( i.e. the @xmath33 plus @xmath34 terms together ) .",
    "3 .   the @xmath34 component of the residual field .",
    "we see that indeed an @xmath30 term in the density causes @xmath33 and @xmath34 terms in the kinematics of the gas . in these examples ,",
    "the @xmath33 term is dominant .    equation ( 2 ) predicts that the @xmath55 term should be fitted to zero by the tilted - ring fit in the case of a @xmath37 perturbation in the potential .",
    "thus , in the @xmath34 component of the residual field , no spiral - like structure should be visible any more . in figure",
    "[ 1 ] , we see that this is indeed the case . instead of spiral structure",
    ", we see radially alternating positive and negative contributions , caused solely by the @xmath56 term .",
    "if the potential would have contained a global intrinsic ellipticity , @xmath57 , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 terms caused by this elongation would have been constant as a function of radius .",
    "therefore , the measured @xmath1 would have been constant and non - zero as well and no radially alternating pattern for @xmath1 would have been visible in this plot .    since in the fitting procedure",
    "the centre was kept fixed , we also see a two - armed spiral in the @xmath34 residual field of the @xmath53 potential perturbation .",
    "if we would have taken the centre as a free parameter in the fit , it would have drifted in such a way as to make the @xmath40 and @xmath58 terms disappear .",
    "ngc 2403 is a nearby ( 3.25 mpc ; begeman , 1987 ) sc(s)iii galaxy ( sandage & tammann , 1981 ) .",
    "it has been observed with the wsrt , @xmath59 hours ( sicking , 1996 ) .",
    "the data have been smoothed to a circular beam of 13 arcseconds .",
    "the second relatively nearby ( 9.4 mpc ; begeman , 1987 ) spiral galaxy we will examine is the sc(rs)i - ii ( sandage & tammann , 1981 ) galaxy ngc 3198 .",
    "this galaxy was observed by sicking ( 1996 ) with the wsrt , also for @xmath60 hours .",
    "the observations have a circular beam with fwhm of @xmath61 arcsec .",
    "both galaxies are well suited for our type of analysis : they have large extents on the sky ( holmberg dimensions : ngc  2403 : @xmath62 and ngc  3198 : @xmath63 ) , have a favourable inclination ( ngc  2403 : @xmath64 , ngc  3198 : @xmath65 ) , the data have high signal / noise , the beams are small and both galaxies show no obvious warp .",
    "the residual maps of the galaxies show only small ( typically @xmath66 km  s@xmath67 ) residuals , but they appear to contain systemic structures .",
    "the first step in our procedure is to fit concentric tilted ",
    "rings to the l.o.s .",
    "velocity fields of these galaxies .",
    "the width of each ring is taken to be about twice the beam size , to be sure that all the individual rings are independent .",
    "table [ [ table1 ] ] lists the radially averaged ring parameters found by the tilted - ring fit .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     after the tilted  ring fit a harmonic fit was made to the velocity fields along each individual ring .",
    "harmonic terms were measured up to ninth order . in figure [ 2 ] , the result for the first four harmonics of ngc  3198 are shown as an example .",
    "the @xmath55 term is zero everywhere in both galaxies , indicating that the inclination is correctly fitted for all rings .",
    "furthermore , we find that in both galaxies harmonics @xmath68 with @xmath69 are consistent with zero . in the lower harmonics ,",
    "clear systematic trends ( as a function of radius ) are visible . using @xmath70 and @xmath56 , we are able to measure @xmath71",
    ". the results of these measurements are given in figure [ 3 ] , where we see that @xmath71 strongly wiggles as a function of radius for ngc  2403 , whereas for ngc  3198 it is fairly constant within errors .",
    "furthermore , note that @xmath72 for ngc  2403 at all radii .",
    "this indicates that , although spiral arms are present that cause the wiggling , there may also be a global elongation present , lifting @xmath71 from an average of @xmath6 to an average of @xmath73 . for ngc  3198",
    "the average value of @xmath2 is very low : @xmath74 .    since the effect of ellipticity and spiral arms",
    "can not be separated unambiguously , these measurements suggest that spiral galaxies are close to axisymmetric . but more galaxies are needed in order to quantify this result ( schoenmakers _ et al .",
