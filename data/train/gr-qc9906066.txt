    "solving the motion of a system of @xmath0 particles interacting through their mutual gravitational forces has long been one of the important themes in physics @xcite .",
    "though an exact solution is known in the @xmath1 case in newtonian theory , in the context of the general theory of relativity the motion of the @xmath0 bodies can not be solved exactly due to dissipation of energy in the form of gravitational radiation , even when @xmath1 .",
    "hence analysis of a two body system in general relativity ( e.g. binary pulsars ) necessarily involves resorting to approximation methods such as a post - newtonian expansion @xcite .",
    "however in the past decade lower dimensional versions of general relativity ( both in ( 1 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions ) have been extensively investigated from both classical and quantum perspectives .",
    "here the reduced dimensionality yields an absence of gravitational radiation .",
    "although this desirable physical feature is lost in such models ( at least in the vacuum ) , most ( if not all ) of the remaining conceptual features of relativistic gravity are retained .",
    "hence their mathematical simplificity offers the hope of obtaining a deep understanding of the nature of gravitation in a wide variety of physical situations .",
    "it is with this motivation that we consider the @xmath0-body problem in lower dimensional gravity .",
    "specifically , we consider the gravitational @xmath0-body problem in two spacetime dimensions . such lineal theories of gravity have found widespread use in other problems in physics .",
    "the simplest such theory ( sometimes referred to as jackiw - teitelboim ( jt ) theory @xcite ) sets the ricci scalar equal to a constant , with other matter fields evolving in this constant - curvature two - dimensional spacetime .",
    "another such theory ( sometimes referred to as @xmath2 theory ) sets the ricci scalar equal to the trace of the stress - energy of the prescribed matter fields and sources  in this manner , matter governs the evolution of spacetime curvature which reciprocally governs the evolution of matter @xcite .",
    "this theory has a consistent newtonian limit @xcite ( a problematic issue for a generic @xmath3-dimensional gravity theory @xcite ) , and reduces to jt theory if the stress - energy is that of a cosmological constant .",
    "the @xmath0-body problem , then , can be formulated in relativistic gravity by taking the matter action to be that of @xmath0 point - particles minimally coupled to gravity . in previous work",
    "we developed the canonical formalism for this action in @xmath2 lineal gravity @xcite and derived the exact hamiltonian for @xmath1 as a solution to a transcendental equation which is valid to infinite order in the gravitational coupling constant @xcite . in the slow motion , weak field limit",
    "this hamiltonian coincides with that of newtonian gravity in @xmath3 dimensions , and in the limit where all bodies are massless , spacetime is flat .",
    "more recently we have extended this case to include a cosmological constant @xmath4 , so that in the limit where all bodies are massless , spacetime has constant curvature ( ie the jt theory is obtained ) , and when @xmath5 vanishes the situation described in the previous paragraph is recovered @xcite . for @xmath1",
    ", we derived an exact solution for the hamiltonian as a function of the proper separation and the centre - of - inertia momentum of the bodies . in the equal mass case an exact solution to the equations of motion for the proper separation of the two point masses as a function of their mutual proper time was also obtained .",
    "the trajectories showed characteristic structures depending on the values of a cosmological constant @xmath5 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to more fully describe these results and to expand upon them .",
    "specifically , we generalize our previous formalism with @xmath6 @xcite to a system of @xmath0 particles in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional gravity with cosmological constant . when @xmath1 we obtain exact solutions for the motion of two bodies of unequal ( and equal ) mass .",
    "since the einstein action is a topological invariant in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions , we must incorporate a scalar ( dilaton ) field into the action @xcite . by a canonical reduction of the action",
    ", the hamiltonian is defined as a spatial integral of the second derivative of the dilaton field , which is a function of the canonical variables of the particles ( coordinates and momenta ) and is determined from the constraint equations . for a system of two particles an equation which determines the hamiltonian in terms of the remaining degrees of freedom of the system",
    "is derived from the matching conditions of the solution to the constraint equations .",
    "we refer to this equation as the determining equation ; it is a transcendental equation which allows one to determine the hamiltonian in terms of the centre of inertia momentum and proper separation of the bodies .",
    "the canonical equations of motion are derived from the hamiltonian . for the equal mass case",
    "they can be transformed so that the separation and momentum are given by differential equations in terms of the proper time . in this latter form",
    "they can be solved exactly in terms of hyperbolic and/or trigonometric functions .",
    "corresponding to the values of the magnitudes ( and signs ) of the energy and other parameters ( e.g. gravitational coupling constant , masses , cosmological constant ) several different types of motion are expected in the 2 body case .",
    "broadly speaking , the two particles could remain either bounded or unbounded , or else balanced between these two conditions .",
    "we shall analyze these various states of motion , and discuss the transitions which occur between them .",
    "we find several surprising situations , including the onset of mutual repulsion for a range of values of negative @xmath7 and the masses , and the diverging separation of the two bodies at finite proper time for a range of values of positive @xmath7 .",
    "we shall also consider the unequal mass case .",
    "in this situation the proper time is no longer the same for the two particles , and so a description of the motion requires a more careful analysis .",
    "we find that we are able to obtain phase space trajectories from the determining equation .",
    "we also can obtain explicit solutions for the proper separation in terms of a transformed time coordinate which reduces to the mutual proper time in the case of equal mass .    in sec.ii",
    "we describe the canonical reduction of the theory and define the hamiltonian for the @xmath0-body system . in sec.iii",
    "we solve the constraint equations for the two - body case and get the determining equation of the hamiltonian , from which the canonical equations of motion are explicitly derived .",
    "we investigate the motion for @xmath8 in sec.iv , by using the exact solutions to the canonical equations .",
    "the motion of equal masses for @xmath9 are analyzed in sec.v where a general discussion on the structure of the determining equation , the plots of phase space trajectories , the analysis of the explicit solutions in terms of the proper time are developed .",
