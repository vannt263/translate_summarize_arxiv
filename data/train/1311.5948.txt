    "in the traditional textbook treatment of measurements in quantum theory one usually comes across projective measurements . for these measurements ,",

    "that is , commuting hermitian operators represent quantum observables that can be jointly measured in a single experimental setup .",
    "furthermore , given a set of @xmath0 projective measurements , commutativity means pairwise commutativity and we have : pairwise compatibility @xmath1 global compatibility .",
    "this equivalence is rather special since it reduces the problem of deciding whether a set of projective measurements is compatible to checking that every pair in the set commutes .",
    "operationally , this also means that the measurement statistics obtained by performing these measurements sequentially on any preparation of a quantum system is independent of the sequence in which the measurements are performed , _",
    "e.g. _ , if @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 are hermitian operators that commute pairwise , then the sequential measurements @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are all physically equivalent",

    "the converse implication is still true .",
    "indeed , one can construct examples where a set of three povms is pairwise compatible but there is no global compatibility between them  @xcite . with this in mind ,",
    "our purpose in this paper is to explore whether there really is any constraint on the ( in)compatibility relations that one could realize between quantum measurements ( povms ) . if , for example , certain sets of ( in)compatibility relations were not allowed in quantum theory then that would point out conceivable joint measurability structures that are nevertheless forbidden in nature .",
    "a basic understanding of what is allowed and what is forbidden in a physical theory is essential from a foundational point of view .",

    ", our larger endeavour in this work is to study the possibilities and limitations of quantum theory with respect to ( in)compatibility relations .",
    "it is a fact worth noting that the impossibility of jointly implementing arbitrary sets of measurements is a key ingredient that enables a demonstration of the nonclassicality of quantum theory in proofs of bell s theorem  @xcite and the kochen ",

    "the connection between bell inequality violations and the joint measurability of observables has also been quantitatively studied  @xcite .    a natural question that arises",
    "when thinking about the ( in)compatibility of observables is the following : given a set of ( in)compatibility relations on a set of vertices representing observables , do they admit a quantum realization ? that is ,",
    "can one write down a positive - operator valued measure ( povm ) for each vertex such that the ( in)compatibility relations among the vertices are realized by the assigned povms ?",
    "after formally defining these notions , we answer this question in the affirmative by providing an explicit construction of povms for any set of ( in)compatibility relations .",
    "this is our main result .",
    "we will use the terms ` ( not ) jointly measurable ' and ` ( in)compatible ' interchangeably in this paper .",
    "part of our motivation in studying this question comes from the simplest example of joint measurability relations realizable with povms but not with projective measurements .",
    "this joint measurability scenario , referred to as specker s scenario  @xcite , involves three binary measurements that can be jointly measured pairwise but not triplewise : that is , for the set of binary measurements @xmath12 , the ( in)compatibility relations are given by the collection of compatible subsets @xmath13 . the remaining nontrivial subset ( with at least two observables ) , namely @xmath12 , is incompatible .",

    "this question is to figure out what compatibility scenarios are realizable in quantum theory .",
