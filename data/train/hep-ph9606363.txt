    "since there is no final state qcd radiation in the drell  yan or higgs production processes , this is clearly an approximation .",
    "if the exact virtual corrections were included , the wilson coefficient functions @xmath58 would have to be modified in a manner consistent with the css formulation , i.e. assuming that the initial and final state gluon radiation for the @xmath7 process factorizes in a similar fashion as the initial state radiation alone in the drell  yan process . while such a factorization is reasonable , there is no formal proof .",
    "therefore , we approximate the @xmath161 ( @xmath15 ) finite virtual corrections with those from the drell  yan ( higgs production ) process . furthermore , the factor @xmath162 for @xmath161 inside the sudakov factor is likely to be different from that for the drell  yan process , so we did not include it in our calculations .",
    "as shown in tables  [ tab_css ] and  [ tab_sigtot ] , as @xmath61 varies between @xmath163 and 1 , the total rate varies by only a few percent , which is about the same magnitude as the uncertainty in the nlo calculations .",
    "clearly , all the other finite contributions from the virtual diagrams other than those similar to the drell  yan virtual contributions for @xmath164 are small  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath50 for this process is the same as for the drell  yan process , we have included it in our order ( 2,1 ) calculation for @xmath161 to improve our predictions , which yields the results shown in the first row of table  2 .",
    "because of the agreement of our predictions for the total rate with the nlo calculation , we apply the results of our calculations to study the kinematic distributions of the @xmath7 pair and the individual @xmath1 or @xmath2 produced in hadron collisions . in the next section , we present these kinematic distributions and compare them to those predicted by showering event generators .",
    "we wish to stress that this is the only type of comparison that is sensible , because the lo calculation predicts a @xmath165 dependence for the @xmath9 distribution , the nlo calculation can not accurately describe the @xmath166 region of phase space , and other resummation formalisms integrate out the @xmath9 dependence and , thus , can not predict the kinematic distributions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    in the following sections , we present results only for order @xmath167 and the canonical choice of renormalization constants @xmath61=1 .",
    "there are at least two reasons for doing this .",
    "first , the coefficients of the non  perturbative function used in this study were fit to data assuming @xmath168 . while the non  perturbative function can affect the shape of distributions",
    ", it does not affect the total rate .",
    "therefore , the stability of our results to variation of @xmath61 is still valid , but we can not trust other choices of @xmath61 to give the correct shape .",
    "second , since we do not integrate out the kinematics , we can not argue that the only scale left in the problem is @xmath5 . since an s  channel process dominates , @xmath169 is motivated by the dynamics .",
    "we have also checked the effect of neglecting final state radiation , and have found that it reduces the total contribution of the css piece to @xmath7 production by about 10% in our approximation and slightly changes the shape near the peak . without the final state radiation , however , the @xmath78piece is not finite as @xmath170 ; therefore we include it in our results .",
    "in this section , we compare our resummed results for the kinematics of the @xmath7 pair and the individual @xmath1 or @xmath2 with those predicted by the showering event generator pythia . to make this comparison more understandable",
    ", we first explain the approximate implementation of resummation in such generators . the starting point for the showering monte carlo technique",
    "is the observation that the leading logarithmic singularities in nlo calculations are contained in the altarelli ",
    "parisi splitting kernels . in this leading log approximation ,",
    "successive parton emissions occur independently , modulo some angular ordering effects . in a monte carlo simulation , which has explicit finite cutoffs for the energy of the emitted radiation ,",
    "it is possible to treat these emissions as a markov chain stretching from the hard scattering _ backwards _ to the initial state partons @xcite .",
    "essentially , one chooses the kinematics for a process at the hard scale @xmath171 based on the lo cross section , then calculates the probability for no parton emission in evolving from a high scale @xmath172 to a lower scale @xmath1 .",
    "this probability is given in the leading log approximation by the sudakov form factor @xmath173 , where @xmath174 here , @xmath175 and @xmath176 are parton distribution functions for partons @xmath177 and @xmath92 and @xmath178 is the altarelli ",
    "parisi splitting function for the branching @xmath179 with momentum fraction @xmath180 . in improved treatments of the sudakov form factor , such as in pythia ,",
    "@xmath28 is evaluated not at the scale @xmath181 , but at @xmath182 @xcite .",
    "if no radiation occurs down to some cutoff @xmath183 ,  @xmath184  2  gev in pythia , then the parton is placed on the mass shell . on the other hand ,",
    "if it is determined that radiation does occur before the cutoff , then a new parton is emitted .",
    "the type of branching @xmath179 which led to the parton emission is determined by the relative weights of the @xmath185 integrals over @xmath186 .",
    "the initiator of the splitting is given the virtuality @xmath1 , and the process continues until a parton reaches the scale @xmath183 , and it is placed on the mass shell . with each splitting , the remaining kinematics are sampled so that energy and momentum are conserved .",
    "the result is a total cross section given by the lo calculation , but with the kinematic distributions of a resummed calculation . in this sense",
    ", it corresponds to a choice of @xmath187 in the css formalism . in the fourier",
    "transform . ]",
    "final state radiation is implemented in a similar fashion , but it occurs _ forward _ from the hard scattering process to the final state and is not weighted by the parton distribution functions .",
    "first , we present a comparison of the resummed and showering monte carlo kinematics for the @xmath7 pair .",
    "several observables which in principle can not be extracted from a nlo calculation are the distributions of the transverse momentum of the @xmath7 pair @xmath9 , the opening angle between @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the azimuthal plane @xmath188 , and the variable @xmath189 and @xmath190 , where @xmath191 is the transverse momentum of the top quark at lo .",
    "as illustrated in table  2 , the lo rate is highly sensitive to the choice of hard scale .",
    "the resummed estimate of the total rate is more reliable .",
    "therefore , to compare the shapes of distributions , we have renormalized the pythia results to have the same total rate as the resummed calculation .    fig .  3 shows the distribution of the resummed variable @xmath9 .",
    "note that the resummed distribution is significantly harder than the showering monte carlo result , implying that the resummed calculation predicts more overall hard radiation .",
    "this is further demonstrated by the @xmath192 distribution , the difference in azimuthal angle between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , in fig .  4 , which is depleted near @xmath193 in comparison to the showering monte carlo .",
    "because of initial or final state radiation , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 are not expected to be exactly back  to  back . the @xmath180 distribution , shown in fig .  5 , is also shifted away from a back  to  back configuration @xmath194 in the resummed result .",
    "finally , the distributions of the rapidity of the @xmath7 pair @xmath195 and the invariant mass @xmath196 are shown in figs .  6 and 7 respectively .",
    "the rapidity distribution is more central for the resummed result and the invariant mass favors higher masses and is broader .",
    "these differences arise because pythia only contains lo matrix elements , while the resummed result contains the dominant piece of the nlo correction .",
    "second , we present a comparison of the kinematics of the individual @xmath1 or @xmath2 . fig .",
    "8 shows the distribution of the transverse momentum of the individual @xmath1 @xmath10 , while fig .",
    "9 shows the difference in their rapidity @xmath197 , where @xmath198 . from the lo calculation",
    ", we know the scale of @xmath10 is set by @xmath5 ( @xmath199 60 gev ) , while the typical transverse momentum @xmath9 is much smaller .",
    "therefore , there is not much difference in these distributions .",
    "likewise , @xmath197 is more sensitive to the pdf ( which determines the boost of the @xmath0 pair ) than the transverse momentum @xmath9 , so we do not expect to observe a large difference . in conclusion , the showering generators ( as typified by pythia in our study ) reproduce the css distributions for the individual @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the @xmath0 pair kinematics in our plots to a 10% level bin  by  bin , although the overall shapes are generally different and the complete resummed results indicate more overall hard radiation .",
    "based on these results , we seek to improve the showering monte carlo technique by using our knowledge of the resummed @xmath9 distribution .",
    "this is discussed in the next section .",
    "despite its limitations in predicting the correct rate , the showing monte carlo technique has a mechanism to approximate the complete resummed result for the @xmath9 distribution .",
    "furthermore , the showering event generator gives a phenomenologically accurate description of all the details of the event .",
    "the resummation calculation only predicts the vector sum of all soft gluon radiation , but has no power to predict how the radiation is distributed amongst individual gluons or quarks .",
    "such details are crucial for estimating the amount of jet activity , which will affect the determination of the top quark mass by reconstructing jets from top quark decays as done by cdf and d0 at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "these estimates are used to engineer cuts to enhance the signal and to optimize the choice of jet definition . in this section",
    ", we present a simple synthesis of the showering monte carlo technique and the full resummation calculation to realize a better estimate of the hadronic activity .",
    "this synthesis is accomplished by reweighting events generated by pythia to agree with the resummed @xmath9 distribution and rate .    to demonstrate the improved predictive ability of the resummed approach , we present the distributions of the jet multiplicity and scalar sum of the transverse energy in @xmath7 events .",
    "we have isolated the contributions from initial and final state radiation only , so that none of the the @xmath1 or @xmath2 decay products ( or additional qcd radiation contributions from them ) are included in these plots .",
    "we define jets using a simple calorimeter simulation ( with cell segmentation @xmath200 ) and a clustering algorithm based on a cone size @xmath201 and a minimum jet transverse energy @xmath202=5 gev .",
    "the energy @xmath203 deposited in each cell of the calorimeter is smeared with a gaussian resolution @xmath204 .",
    "the jet multiplicity distribution is shown in fig .",
    "note the shift in the peak value of the distribution from 0 jets to 1 jet .",
    "the resummation based monte carlo clearly predicts more hard radiation in @xmath7 events at hadron colliders .",
    "similar information is conveyed in fig .",
    "11 , which shows the scalar sum of the transverse energy of the jets defined as above .",
    "while the details of jet observables can only be studied using the showering monte carlo technique , our knowledge of the resummed @xmath9 distribution allows improvement .",
    "it is straightforward to extend these results to include the decay products of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 and even the hard gluons from the qcd radiative decay of the top quark @xcite .",
    "we shall leave this for further study .    as a final point of comparison ,",
    "we have attempted to quantify the effect of hard gluon radiation on the extraction of @xmath5 from data .",
    "the issue at hand is how often a hard gluon from radiation is misidentified as a top quark decay product . using a sample of events where @xmath205 , we cluster particles into jets as described above and analyze events with 4 or more hard jets ( @xmath20615 gev , @xmath207 ) .",
    "we separate the jets than can be identified with a @xmath2 decay product ( for simplicity , we assume the @xmath92 is correctly tagged ) and find the one with the lowest @xmath208 . the fraction of events where another jet ( i.e. one not from @xmath2 decay ) has a higher @xmath208 than this is an estimate of the importance of the hard radiation . while this is only a crude estimate of the real effect , we find that the fraction ( @xmath209 ) does not differ between the standard and improved pythia .",
    "this implies that the hard gluon error on the top mass measurement is well estimated by showering generators , though this requires further study .",
    "we have not attempted to quantify the effect of soft gluon radiation , where the radiation is not resolved as an individual jet but can overlap with the @xmath0 decay products , though the complete resummed result indicates that this too should be enhanced .",
    "to further study the interactions of the top quark and to better measure its mass , we must understand the kinematic distributions of the transverse momentum , rapidity and azimuthal angle of the top quarks .",
    "the kinematics of the top quarks produced at hadron colliders can be accurately predicted only after resumming the multiple soft gluon emissions in either the initial state or the final state . in this work ,",
    "we have adopted the css resummation formalism to obtain the kinematics of the top quarks .",
    "the approximation we made in this study should be adequate because of the large top quark mass .",
    "the important consequence of the large top quark mass is that the logarithmic terms from the initial state are more important than those from the final state . in the former case ,",
    "there is double  logarithmic behavior due to both soft and collinear gluon radiation , while , in the latter case , only single - logarithmic behavior due to soft but not collinear gluon radiation is possible up to the order @xmath89 .",
    "we compared our resummation calculation with those predicted by the full event generator pythia and found that the latter does not give the same prediction as ours . in view of the fact that the full event generator has been widely used by our experimentalist colleagues for analyzing their data",
    ", it is important to point out the difference between the results from this approach and those from the analytical calculation . in determining the mass of the top quark , for example",
    ", one needs to account for the jet activity in at least two cases : ( 1 ) when a hard jet from the showering is misidentified as one of the top decay jets , and ( 2 ) when the soft radiation is included in the energy determination of true top decay products . the hybrid approach presented in section  5 , which relates the transverse momentum of the top ",
    "antitop quark pair from an analytic calculation to the balancing gluon radiation from a showering monte carlo , contains a more realistic description of event structure , which could be used for choosing kinematic cuts and tuning the jet energy correction algorithm .",
