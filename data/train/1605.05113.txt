    "<S> it was proposed that the narrow @xmath0 structure observed by the lhcb collaboration in the reaction @xmath1 might be due to a triangle singularity around the @xmath2proton threshold at 4.45  gev . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> if these structures are genuine resonance states , being in the mass region with a pair of charm and anti - charm quarks , they would contain five valence quarks . </S>",
    "<S> further , the lhcb collaboration recently reported a refined model - independent analysis in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite which shows that the @xmath6 invariant mass distribution can not be described without introducing additional contribution due to exotic hadrons , such as the @xmath5 , or rescattering effects , such as the triangle singularities to be discussed here . after the discovery </S>",
    "<S> , they have been suggested to be meson - baryon hadronic molecules ( predictions of such meson - baryon states  @xcite have been made a few years before the lhcb discovery ) or compact pentaquarks by a number of groups  @xcite ( see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for partial reviews ) </S>",
    "<S> .    however , not all peaks in invariant mass distributions are due to resonances , which are poles of the @xmath11-matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath11-matrix also possesses other types of singularities , such as the branch points ( and the associated cuts ) at two - body thresholds , and also the so - called triangle singularity originating from a triangle diagram . </S>",
    "<S> poles of the @xmath11-matrix are of dynamical origin in the sense that they exist because the interaction among the internal constituents is strong enough such that poles are generated in the scattering amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this is necessarily a non - perturbative phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , singularities like branch points and triangle singularities are of kinematical origin . </S>",
    "<S> they emerge in the physical amplitude and can produce observable effects when the kinematics of a process is special . for detailed discussions about the triangle singularity , we refer to the 1960ties monographs  @xcite , recent lecture notes by one of the key players in the old days  @xcite and the book  @xcite . for instance , considering a triangle diagram , if the involved masses and momenta are such that all of the three intermediate particles can go on shell with all of the interaction vertices satisfying energy - momentum conservation  @xcite , then the triangle singularity is on the physical boundary and can show up as a peak in the corresponding invariant mass distribution .        to be more explicit , let us take fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : triangle ] and explain the kinematical region where the triangle singularity can occur . </S>",
    "<S> the diagram can be interpreted as particle @xmath12 decays into particles @xmath13 and @xmath14 , following by the sequential decay of @xmath13 into @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and @xmath14 and @xmath16 react to generate the external @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> we may consider the rest frame of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the triangle singularity is on the physical boundary when all of the intermediates states @xmath18 are on their mass shell , and moreover , particle @xmath16 moves along the same direction and with a larger speed than particle @xmath14 . in this kinematical region , </S>",
    "<S> particle @xmath16 can catch up with particle @xmath14 to rescatter like a classical process .    in the last few years , triangle singularities </S>",
    "<S> have been used to explain various structures in invariant mass distributions of two or three hadrons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> triangle singularities present another possibility of explaining the lhcb @xmath5 structures . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the narrower structure @xmath0 coincides with the @xmath19 threshold which is also the position of the triangle singularity of the loop diagram with @xmath20 intermediate states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the @xmath5 structures are really due to triangle singularities , the lhcb discovery will still be very important because triangle singularities are one of the intriguing analytic properties of the @xmath11-matrix , and their observability has been discussed since long time ago ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a classics , and ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a recent discussion ) .    </S>",
    "<S> being the first candidates of explicitly exotic pentaquark states structures can be formed by three light quarks , and thus are non - exotic . however , since they are located above 4  gev , if they are light baryons the vast amount of phase space would allow them to decay into light hadrons very fast and the widths would be much larger than those reported by the lhcb collaboration . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is more natural to assume that there are a pair of charm and anticharm quarks inside the annihilation of which into light hadrons are suppressed . ] , either as hadronic molecules or compact pentaquarks , one of the utmost important issues regarding the observed @xmath5 structures is to distinguish the kinematic singularity explanation from resonances . because the triangle singularity depends on the kinematics very strongly </S>",
    "<S> , one should search for the @xmath5 structures in processes with a different kinematics where the triangle singularities discussed in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite do not play a role . for this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> suggested experiments include searching for the @xmath5 structures in the @xmath21 invariant mass distribution of the decay @xmath22 which is expected to have a similar branching fraction as that of the @xmath23  @xcite , and searching for the structures in reactions with a different kinematics such as the photoproduction processes  @xcite , pion induced reactions  @xcite and heavy ion collisions  @xcite . from this point of view , investigating whether other processes with a @xmath3 in the final state have similar triangle singularities is important and necessary . </S>",
    "<S> one of such processes which is closely related to the observation process of the @xmath5 structures is the reaction @xmath24 , the @xmath6 invariant mass distribution of which has in fact been measured by the lhcb collaboration  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this process was studied in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in the context of hidden - charm pentaquarks , and it is noted that there is indeed a nontrivial structure around 4.45  gev . here we will discuss further the model proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite which observes that the narrow @xmath0 might be due to kinematic singularities related to the @xmath25 normal and abnormal thresholds . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it is noticed that the narrow @xmath0 is located exactly at the @xmath25 threshold , @xmath26 , and when the measured decay @xmath7 occurs through the @xmath27 triangle diagram , where the @xmath28 decays into the @xmath29 and @xmath2 first and the proton as a decay product of the @xmath29 rescatters with the @xmath2 into the @xmath6 , the triangle singularity ( abnormal threshold ) is also located at the same place . to be more precise </S>",
    "<S> , it is slightly moved into the complex energy plane because the @xmath29 can decay into @xmath30 and thus has a finite width . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that there can also be triangle singularities around 4.45  gev in the three - body decay @xmath31 as well , which are able to reproduce the nontrivial @xmath6 invariant mass distribution in that region .    </S>",
    "<S> for a given triangle diagram , the locations of the triangle singularities , also called leading landau singularities , are given by solving the quadratic equation  @xcite @xmath32 with @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the definitions of the momenta and masses can be read off from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : triangle ] . </S>",
    "<S> the singularities need to be understood with the help of the analytic properties of the @xmath11-matrix . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , let us consider the diagram shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : triangle ] , and consider the case measuring the @xmath34 invariant mass distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold of @xmath14 and @xmath16 leads to a branch point . </S>",
    "<S> the cut from this branch point divides the complex @xmath35 plane into two riemann sheets , and the upper boundary of the cut in the first riemann sheet presents the physical region of the process @xmath36 , where @xmath17 can be regarded as the total momentum of the particles emitted from the scattering between @xmath14 and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that one of the solutions of the quadratic equation in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> is always far from the physical region , and the the other one could be close to the physical region ( and also close to the threshold of @xmath14 and @xmath16 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this happens when it is located in the lower half plane of the second riemann sheet , below the cut , with a small imaginary part ( for a more detailed discussion for the case of the @xmath37 , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the condition is that all of the three intermediate particles are on their mass shells , and the rescattering between @xmath14 and @xmath16 can happen as a classical process  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is fulfilled when @xmath13 is inside or at least in the vicinity of the range @xmath38 $ ] with  @xcite @xmath39 substituting this range of @xmath13 into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : landau ] ) , and noticing that only one of the solutions is possible to be near the physical region  ( see discussions in , e.g. , refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , the triangle singularity in the variable @xmath40 lies in the corresponding range @xmath41 .\\ ] ] the upper bound can also be written as @xmath42 by using that @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which are valid only for @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> one notices that if the resonance @xmath13 takes a mass of @xmath46 , the amplitude will be singular at @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> of course , a physical amplitude never diverges in the physical region . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the fact that all the intermediate particles can go on shell means that the particle @xmath13 can decay into particles @xmath16 and @xmath15 , and thus it must be an unstable resonance . as a consequence , the triangle singularity can not reside on the real @xmath40 axis , but in the complex plane so that the relevant amplitude in the physical region still takes a finite value . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , if the singularity is not located deep in the complex plane , it will then introduce a visible peak around the real part of the singularity location in the @xmath40 distribution . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , for a value of @xmath13 slightly beyond the range given in eq .  , the singularity is not far from the physical boundary and could still cause a visible effect .    </S>",
    "<S> since the peak position of the @xmath0 coincides with the @xmath25 threshold , we consider the case with @xmath14 and @xmath16 being the @xmath2 and proton , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the triangle diagram suggested in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the process @xmath48 is shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> , there are two three - star nucleon resonances : the @xmath54 with @xmath55 and the @xmath56 with @xmath57 . substituting @xmath58  gev and @xmath59  gev as their masses  , and we use the central values of the masses and widths as given by the pdg  @xcite . ] in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , we find triangle singularities at @xmath60 respectively . because the singularity is in the second riemann sheet of the complex @xmath61 plane , the absolute value of amplitude with the singularities as given in eq .  , as well as that for the @xmath48 , is maximized at the @xmath25 threshold . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the real parts of the singularity positions are smaller than the branch point , the @xmath25 threshold . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus similar to the case that an amplitude that possesses a virtual state pole has a sharp cusp at the relevant threshold . however , since the imaginary parts of the values given above is larger than that for the one induced by the @xmath29 for the process @xmath48 , @xmath62  mev , the peak due to the triangle singularities through the exchange of the @xmath52 as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : loops ]  ( a ) . here </S>",
    "<S> , we do not intend to construct a full model for the three - body decay @xmath50 , which is a formidable task if all the final state interactions including the exchange of @xmath52 resonances , and even the exotic @xmath63 , and kinematical singularities are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we only want to illustrate that the bump around 4.45  gev in its @xmath3 invariant mass distribution observed by the lhcb collaboration may be due to the triangle singularities discussed above . since we do not know the relative strength for the decays @xmath64 and @xmath65 </S>",
    "<S> , we choose to include only the @xmath56 which has the same spin and parity as the @xmath29 . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath52 exchanges can describe well the @xmath69 invariant mass distribution , and provide a smooth background to the @xmath6 one . </S>",
