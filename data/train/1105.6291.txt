    "bose einstein condensates ( becs ) provide an excellent environment to study experimentally and theoretically a rich variety of macroscopic quantum phenomena . in a rotating single component condensate , topological defects to the order parameter often manifest themselves as vortices that correspond to a zero of the order parameter with a circulation of the phase .",
    "when they get numerous , these vortices arrange themselves on a triangular lattice .",
    "in fact , vortices were first observed in two - component bec s @xcite . since then two - component becs and the topological excitations within",
    "have been experimentally realised in a number of configurations : a single isotope that is in two different hyperfine spin states @xcite , two different isotopes of the same atom @xcite or isotopes of two different atoms @xcite .",
    "when a two - component condensate is under rotation , topological defects of both order parameters are created which lead to more exotic defects such as singly or multiply quantised skyrmions @xcite .",
    "analogy with the skyrme model from particle physics is often invoked to represent the defects @xcite .",
    "the singly quantised skyrmions contain a vortex in one component which has the effect of creating a corresponding density peak in the other component .",
    "these singly quantised skyrmions are often referred to as coreless vortices . once",
    "numerous , these vortices and peaks arrange themselves in ( coreless vortex ) lattices , that can be either triangular or square .",
    "other defects such as vortex sheets or giant skyrmions can also be observed @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to classify the type of defects according to the different parameters of the problem restricting ourselves to two - dimensions .",
    "while this paper will only concern itself with magnetically trapped two - component bec s , there is active research into spinor condensates ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .    in the mean - field regime ,",
    "the two - component bose - einstein condensate at zero temperature is described in terms of two wave functions ( order parameters ) , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively representing component-1 and component-2 .",
    "the two - component condensate is placed into rotation about the @xmath3-axis with @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the rotation frequency assumed to apply equally to both components .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) energy functional of the rotating two - component , two - dimensional bec is then given by @xmath6=\\int \\sum_{k=1,2}\\bigg(\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_k}|\\nabla\\psi_k|^2+v_k(\\bm{r})|\\psi_k|^2\\\\ -\\hbar\\bar{\\omega}\\psi^*_k l_z \\psi_k + \\frac{u_k}{2}|\\psi_k|^4\\bigg)+u_{12}|\\psi_1|^2|\\psi_2|^2\\quad d^2r \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the harmonic trapping potentials with trapping frequencies @xmath9 , centered at the origin . here",

    "the energy functional ( [ enfn ] ) contains three interaction constants : @xmath15 representing the internal interactions in component @xmath16 , and @xmath17 representing the interactions between the two components .",
    "the time - dependent coupled gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equations are obtained from a variational procedure , @xmath18 , on the energy functional ( [ enfn ] ) .",
    "let @xmath19 be the average of the trapping frequencies of the two components and introduce the reduced mass @xmath20 such that @xmath21 .",
    "the gp energy and the coupled gp equations can be non - dimensionalised by choosing @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 as units of time , energy and length respectively . on defining the non - dimensional intracomponent coupling parameters @xmath25 and the intercomponent coupling parameter @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) ,",

    "@xcite produced a numerical phase diagram in terms of the rotation and the intercomponent coupling strengths : they found phase separation regions with either vortex sheets or droplet behavior and regions of coexistence of the components with coreless vortices , arranged in triangular or square lattices .    in this paper",
    ", we present a classification of the ground states and various types of topological defect when the intracomponent coupling strengths are distinct .",
    "depending on the magnitude of the various parameters the components can either coexist , spatially separate or exhibit symmetry breaking .",
    "a richer phenomenology of topological defects is then found .    much of the analysis carried out to investigate the ground states and topological defects will use a a nonlinear sigma model .",
