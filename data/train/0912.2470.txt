    "hot spots and knots in large - scale jets have been observed in many active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "hot spots are often found near the outmost boundaries of radio lobes .",
    "they are regarded as jet termination ( fnanaroff & riley 1974 ; blandford & rees 1974 ; begelman et al .",
    "1984 ; bicknell 1985 ; meisenheimer et al .",
    "knots are usually thought to be a part of a well - collimated jet ( e.g. , harris & krawczynski 2006 ) .",
    "some of them are also detected in the optical and x - ray bands . with high spatial resolution and sensitivity ,",
    "the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory opened a new era to study the x - ray emission of hot spots and knots .",
    "it revealed that bright radio knots and hot spots in radio galaxies and quasars are also often detected in the x - ray band ( wilson et al .",
    "2001 ; hardcastle et al . 2004",
    "; kataoka & stawarz 2005 ; tavecchio et al .",
    ".    the x - ray radiation mechanisms of hot spots and knots are highly debated .",
    "it is generally believed that synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons is responsible for the radio emission .",
    "the detection of high polarization in the optical emission indicates that the optical emission is also from synchrotron radiation ( roser & meisenheimer 1987 ; lhteenmki & valtaoja 1999 ) .",
    "it is uncertain whether the x - ray emission is a simple extrapolation of the synchrotron radiation for the radio - to - optical emission .",
    "indeed , the x - rays of some hot spots ( such as hot spots n1 and n2 in 3c 33 ; kraft et al .",
    "2007 ) and knots ( such as the knots in 3c 371 and m87 ; sambruna et al . 2007",
    "; liu & shen 2007 ) can be interpreted as synchrotron radiation from the same electron population responsible for the radio and optical emission . however , the x - ray emission of some hot spots and knots is apparently not a simple extrapolation of the radio - to - optical component ( kataoka & stawarz 2005 ) .",
    "an inverse compton scattering ( ic ) component is necessary to model the x - rays . as shown by stawarz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the x - ray emission of hot spots in cygnus a is well interpreted with the synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) scattering model .",
    "the ic scattering of cosmic microwave background ( ic / cmb ) may also significantly contribute to the observed x - ray emission , if the bulk flow of the material in hot spots and knots is relativistic ( georganopoulos & kazanas 2003 ) .",
    "broadband spectral energy distribution ( sed ) places strong constraints on the radiation mechanism models .",
    "systematical analysis on the seds in the radio and x - ray bands of hot spots , knots and lobes were present by hardcastle et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and kataoka & stawarz ( 2005 ) .",
    "note that the optical data are critical to characterize the seds , and may give more constraints on the models . in this paper",
    ", we compile a large sample of the observed seds in the radio - optical - x - ray band of hot spots and knots from literature , and fit them with various models in order to study the radiation mechanisms of the x - rays and to reveal the differences of the two kinds of sources .",
    "the magnetic field and doppler boosting effect are crucial ingredients in sed modeling .",
    "the energy equipartition assumption between magnetic field and radiating electrons is usually accepted in discussion of the energetics and dynamics of radio sources .",
    "hardcastle et al . (",
    "2004 ) reported that most radio - luminous hot spots can be explained with the ssc model under this assumption . with the equipartition condition ,",
    "the derived magnetic field of lobes is @xmath16 g ( kataoka & stawarz 2005 ) , being comparable to the strength of the magnetic field in the interstellar medium . since",
    "hot spots are believed to be the terminal of a relativistic jet , the doppler boosting effect would be less prominent than that in knots , but their magnetic fields may be magnified up to @xmath17 g by strong external shocks produced by interaction of a relativistic jet with circum medium ( kataoka & stawarz 2005 ) .",
    "therefore , the doppler boosting effect and co - moving magnetic field are essential to discriminate the two kinds of sources , if they are physically different . with our detailed sed fits ,",
    "we compare their doppler factor ( @xmath10 ) and co - moving magnetic field ( @xmath18 ) between the knots and hot spots in our sample under the equipartition assumption .",
    "the observed seds and our data analysis are present in  2 .",
    "models and our sed fits are shown in  3 .",
    "conclusions and discussion are present in  4 . throughout",
    ", @xmath19=70 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are adopted .",
    "twenty - two hot spots and 45 knots from 35 agns ( 15 radio galaxies , 16 quasars , 3 bl lac objects , and 1 seyfert galaxy ; see table 1 ) are included in our sample .",
    "most of them are taken from xjet home page .",
    "observations for these hot spots and knots are summarized in table 2 , and their seds are displayed in figure 1 .",
    "we show the distributions and the correlations of the spectral indices in the radio and x - ray bands ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) in figure 2 . it is found that @xmath23 is not correlated with @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath23 of both the knots and hot spots are smaller than 1 .",
    "the @xmath24 narrowly clusters at @xmath25 for the hot spots , but it ranges in @xmath26 for the knots .",
    "we test whether @xmath23 and @xmath24 distributions show statistical differences between the two kinds of sources with the kolmogorov - smirnov test ( k - s test ) , which yields a chance probability @xmath27 . a k - s test probability larger than 0.1 would strongly suggest no statistical difference between two distributions .",
    "we get @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the radio spectral indices and the x - ray spectral indices between the two samples , respectively , indicating that no statistical difference is found for the @xmath23 and @xmath24 distributions of two kinds of sources .",
    "figure [ fig:3](a ) shows the correlations between the observed luminosities at 5 ghz and 1 kev ( @xmath30 and @xmath1 ) for the hot spots and the knots .",
    "it is found that @xmath1 is tightly correlated with @xmath0 .",
    "we measure the correlations with the spearman correlation analysis , which yields @xmath31 with a correlation coefficient @xmath32 and a chance probability @xmath33 for the hot spots and @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath33 for the knots .",
    "the slopes of the two correlations are the same in the error scopes , but averagely speaking , the x - ray luminosity of the knots is larger than that of the hot spots with @xmath36 order of magnitude , indicating systematical difference between the two kinds of sources . as seen in  3.3 ,",
    "this correlation is much tighter by correcting with the doppler boosting effect ( see figure [ fig:3](b ) and details in  3.3 ) .",
    "the knots and the hot spots in the @xmath30-@xmath1 plane are roughly separated with a division line of @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the ratio of @xmath38 is a characteristic to distinguish the hot spots and the knots .",
    "this ratio should be an intrinsic parameter independent of the doppler boosting effect and the cosmological effect .",
    "it may reflect the properties of the radiation regions .",
    "the tight @xmath30-@xmath1 correlation indicates that the radiations in the two energy bands may be produced by the same electron population . for few cases , such as hot spots n1 and n2 in 3c 33 and knots in m87 ( kraft et al .",
    "2007 ; liu & shen 2007 ) , their x - ray spectra are soft with @xmath39 , and smoothly connect to the spectrum in the radio and optical band .",
    "the x - rays of these sources may be the high energy tail of the synchrotron radiation by the same electron population for the radio and optical emission .",
    "the synchrotron radiation model is preferred to fit the x - rays of these sources .",
    "some well - sampled seds in figure 1 roughly show two bumps similar to that observed in blazars .",
    "the two - bump feature is generally interpreted with the synchrotron radiation and ic scattering by the relativistic electrons .",
    "therefore , we fit these seds with single - zone synchrotron + ic scatting models . the ic seed photons may be originated from the synchrotron radiation itself ( ssc ) or from the cmb .",
    "the photon field energy density of synchrotron radiation in the co - moving frame is given by @xmath40 erg @xmath41 , where @xmath42 in cgs units , @xmath10 the beaming factor , @xmath43 the radius of the radiation region , and @xmath44 the speed of light .",
    "the energy density of the cmb is @xmath45 erg @xmath41 , which dramatically increases with the redshift @xmath46 of the sources and the bulk lorentz factor @xmath47 ( taking @xmath48 ) of the radiation site . without considering the doppler boosting effect , the ic component should be dominated by the ssc process , but it may be dominated by the ic / cmb , if the source is relativistic motion .",
    "we take the two scenarios into account .    in our models ,",
    "the radiation region is assumed to be a homogeneous sphere with radius @xmath43 .",
    "the radius is derived from the angular radius @xmath49 ( see table 2 ) , which is obtained from the optical or the x - ray observations .",
    "considering the beaming effect , _ r _ and volume _ v _ of the emitting region are needed to take a relativistic transformation .",
    "we simply assume that the emitting region still is a sphere with @xmath50 and derive the radius of emitting region in co - moving frame by @xmath51 .",
    "the electron distribution as a function of electron energy ( @xmath52 ) is taken as a single power - law or a broken power law , @xmath53 where @xmath54 are the energy indices of electrons below and above the break energy @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are the observed spectral indices .    in our calculations , the klein - nishina effect for the radiation in the gev - tev band is considered , but the absorption in the gev - tev band by the infrared background light and by cmb photon during the gamma - ray photons propagating to the earth ( stecker et al .",
    "2006 ) is not taken into account .      as mentioned in  1 , the equipartition condition , which assumes that the magnetic field energy density @xmath57 is equal to the electron energy density @xmath58 ,",
    "is usually adopted in discussion of the x - ray origin .",
    "we first derive the magnetic field strength @xmath5 ( see appendix a ) under this condition for the hot spots and knots in our sample without considering the beaming effect ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the calculation of @xmath5 depends on @xmath59 ( see eqs .",
    "a5 and a10 ) .",
    "the @xmath59 is quite uncertain ( e.g. , harris & krawczynski 2006 ) .",
    "the @xmath59 values of 12 hot spots and all the knots in our sample are constrained with the observed seds via a method reported by tavecchio et al .",
    "the average of @xmath59 for the 12 hot spots is @xmath60 . for those hot spots that their @xmath59 lost constraints from the observed seds , we take @xmath61 in our calculation .",
    "we fit the observed seds in the radio - optical band with the synchrotron radiation model to derive @xmath5 .",
    "our results are reported in table 2 .",
    "they are roughly consistent with the results derived from the formulae given by brunetti et al .",
    "the distributions of @xmath5 for both the hot spots and knots are shown in figure [ fig:4](a ) .",
    "they range in @xmath62 @xmath63 g .",
    "no systematical difference of @xmath5 is found between the two kinds of sources .",
    "the observed x - ray spectra of the knots in 4c 73.18 ( k - a ) , pks 0521 ( k ) , m87 ( k - a , b , c1 , d , e , f ) , 3c 31 ( k ) , 3c 66b ( k - b ) , and 3c 120 ( k - k7 ) smoothly connect to the spectra in the radio and optical band .",
    "they are well fit with the synchrotron radiation model ( the thin solid line in figure [ fig:1 ] ) , indicating that the x - rays of these sources are the high energy tail of the synchrotron radiation by the same electron population for the radio and optical emission .",
    "we do not take these sources into account in our following analysis .",
    "the observed x - ray spectral indices and seds shown in table 2 and figure [ fig:1 ] indicate that the x - rays of most hot spots and knots should be contributed by ic scattering .",
    "we model the seds with the synchrotron + ic model assuming that the sources are at rest . in this scenario",
    ", the ssc process should dominate the ic process , as mentioned above . although the contribution of ic / cmb to the x - ray emission is not negligible for some sources at high redshift",
    ", we only consider the ssc component in this section .",
    "we first calculate the x - ray flux density at 1 kev ( @xmath64 ) with the synchrotron + ssc model under the equipartition assumption , i.e. , @xmath65 .",
    "our results are reported in table 2 .",
    "we measure the consistency between @xmath64 and @xmath66 with ratio @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the observed flux density at 1 kev .",
    "it is found that @xmath69 is much larger than 1 for almost all the hot spots and knots in our sample , indicating that the observed x - ray flux density is much larger than the model prediction .",
    "the distributions of @xmath69 , and @xmath69 as a function of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath14 for the hot spots and knots are shown in figure [ fig:5 ] .",
    "a tentative correlation presented in the @xmath70 plane shows that the brighter sources in the radio band tend to be more consistent with the equipartition condition ( see figure [ fig:5](b ) ) .",
    "however , no similar feature is seen for the x - ray bright sources ( see figure [ fig:5](c ) ) .",
    "it is interesting that @xmath69 is anti - correlated with @xmath14 , and both the hot spots and knots shape a well sequence ( see figure [ fig:5](d ) ) .",
    "the hot spots are at the lower end of the sequence and they tend to be closer to the equipartition condition than the knots .    as shown above , the derived x - ray flux densities from the ssc model under the equipartition condition significantly deviate the observations , especially for the knots . in order to model the observed seds with the synchrotron + ssc model , we have to get rid of this assumption . keeping the model parameters the same",
    "as that used above , we fit the seds with this model and derive the magnetic field strengths ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the fits are shown in figure [ fig:1 ] ( the thick solid line ) .",
    "although the ssc model can represent the observed flux at 1 kev for the knots in 4c 73.18 ( k - a ) , pks 0521 , m87 ( k - a , b , c1 , d , e , f ) , 3c 31 , 3c 66b ( k - b ) , 3c 120 ( k - k7 ) , 3c 273 ( k - c1 , c2 , d1 , d2h3 ) , the bow ties defined by the errors of the x - ray spectral indices clearly rule out this model for these knots .",
    "as discussed in section 3.1 , the x - rays of these knots are well fitted by the synchrotron radiation model except knots in 3c 273 .",
    "we do not include these knots in our following statistics .",
    "the derived @xmath71 are listed in table 2 , and their distributions are shown in figure [ fig:4](b ) .",
    "it is found that the @xmath71 of the knots are much smaller than the hot spots , with medians of @xmath72 g and @xmath73 @xmath63 g for the knots and hot spots , respectively . comparing @xmath71 with @xmath74",
    ", it is found that they are roughly consistent for the hot spots , indicating that the x - rays of the hot spots can be roughly fitted with the ssc model under the equipartition condition . however , the @xmath71 of the knots are much smaller than @xmath74 , even unreasonably smaller than the magnetic field strength of the interstellar medium for some knots .",
    "therefore , the x - rays of these knots may not be dominated by the ssc component .    to investigate the deviation of @xmath71 to @xmath75 for individual source , we define ratio @xmath76 , which is physically the same as @xmath69 .",
    "similar to @xmath69 , @xmath8 is much larger than 1 for almost all the sources , especially for the knots .",
    "the distributions of @xmath8 and @xmath8 as a function of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath14 are shown in figure [ fig:6 ] .",
    "we find the same features as shown in figure [ fig:5 ] .",
    "it is generally believed that the knots should have relativistic motion .",
    "the hot spots may also be relativistic ( dennett - thorpe et al .",
    "1997 ; tavecchio et al . 2005 ; harris & krawczynski 2006 ) . in this section",
    ", we fit the seds with the synchrotron + ic model by considering the beaming effect under the equipartition condition . in this scenario ,",
    "the ic / cmb process should dominate the ic component .",
    "although the contribution of ssc is negligible comparing with ic / cmb in this case , we still take ssc process into account in our calculation .",
    "our fits are shown in figure [ fig:1 ] ( the dashed line ) . the distributions of @xmath10 for the knots and hot spots are shown in figure [ fig:7 ] .",
    "it is found that , averagely , @xmath77 for most of the knots and @xmath78 for most of the hot spots . some sources in our sample",
    "are included in kataoka & stawarz ( 2005 ) .",
    "we compare our results of @xmath10 for these sources with that reported by kataoka & stawarz ( 2005 ) ( @xmath79 ) in figure [ fig:8 ] .",
    "they are roughly consistent .",
    "the @xmath11 distributions with comparison to @xmath5 and @xmath80 are shown in figure [ fig:4](c ) .",
    "the @xmath12 distributions are more consistent with @xmath5 than @xmath80 .",
    "both @xmath11 and @xmath5 distributions approximately span an order of magnitude , much narrower than that of @xmath80 , especially for the knots .",
    "all @xmath11 are larger than the magnetic filed strength of the interstellar medium , implying that the magnetic filed of the interstellar medium would be amplified in the knots and hot spots by the turbulence of the relativistic shocks .",
    "the @xmath11 of the knots are smaller than that of the hot spots , with typical values of 10 @xmath63 g and 40 @xmath63 g for the knots and the hot spots , respectively , favoring the idea of different origins of the shocks ( internal vs. external ) for the two kinds of sources ( e.g. , harris & krawczynski 2006 ) .",
    "as our discussed in  2 , @xmath14 is an intrinsic characteristic for the sources .",
    "it may be a representative of the co - moving magnetic field and the doppler boosting effect of the sources .",
    "we show @xmath14 as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath10 in figure [ fig:9 ] . it is found that @xmath14 is correlated with @xmath11 for the knots , with a linear coefficient of @xmath81 and chance probability @xmath33 .",
    "we obtain @xmath82 .",
    "no significant correlation between @xmath14 and @xmath11 is found for the hot spots .",
    "however , both the knots and hot spots form a sequence in the @xmath83 plane , with a best linear fit @xmath84 .",
    "the hot spots locate at the higher end of the sequence .",
    "similar feature is also observed in the @xmath85 plane , as shown in figure 9(b ) .",
    "these results imply that @xmath14 would be determined by both @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "the strong anti - correlation of @xmath86 ( or @xmath87 ) shown in figure [ fig:5 ] ( or figure [ fig:6 ] ) may be due to neglect of the beaming effect .",
    "this effect plays important role on the observed flux since the observed flux is proportional to @xmath88 .",
    "correcting by the doppler boosting effect , we show the @xmath89 relations in figure 3(b ) .",
    "the relations are tighter than the observed ones , with a linear coefficient of @xmath90 and @xmath91 for the knots and hot spots , respectively .",
    "we have present extensive analysis and sed fits for 22 hot spots and 45 knots in 35 agn jets .",
    "we find that @xmath30 and @xmath1 are tightly correlated .",
    "the two kinds of sources can be roughly separated with a division of @xmath92 .",
    "our sed fits show that the mechanisms of the x - rays are diverse .",
    "while the x - ray emission of a small fraction of the sources is a simple extrapolation of the synchrotron radiation for the radio - to - optical emission , the ic component may dominate the observed x - rays for most of the sources . without considering the relativistic bulk motion , the ssc model can explain the x - rays for some hot spots with @xmath4 being consistent with the equipartition magnetic field @xmath5 in one order of magnitude , but an unreasonably low magnetic field strength is required in modeling the x - rays for all knots with this model .",
    "considering relativistic bulk motion for the sources , the ic / cmb dominated model well explains the x - ray emission for most sources under the equipartition condition . although the derived @xmath11 and @xmath10 for some hot spots are comparable to that of the knots , the @xmath11 value for the knots tends to be smaller than that of the hot spots and the @xmath10 tends to be larger , favoring the idea that the hot spots are jet termination and knots are a part of a well - collimated jet .",
    "corrected by the beaming effect , the @xmath93 relations for the two kinds of sources are even tighter than the observed ones , indicating that the correlations are intrinsic .",
    "the ratio @xmath14 is correlated with @xmath13 and @xmath10 .",
    "these facts suggest that , under the equipartition condition , the differences on the x - ray observations for the knots and hot spots would be mainly due to the differences of the doppler boosting effect and the co - moving magnetic field , although some hot spots have similar feature to the knots",
    ".    the @xmath14 may be an indicator of @xmath13 and @xmath10 .",
    "it is an intrinsic parameter independent of the doppler boosting and the cosmological effects .",
    "our results show that the x - rays of a hot spot with larger @xmath14 are better to be fitted with the ssc model under equipartition condition without considering the beaming effect .",
    "this is consistent with that reported by hardcastle et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who found that the x - rays of the radio - bright hot spots can be explained with the ssc model under equipartition condition .",
    "the strong anti - correlation between @xmath8 ( or @xmath69 ) and @xmath14 may also offer a tool to discriminate the two kinds of sources .",
    "we find in the figures [ fig:3 ] , [ fig:5 ] and [ fig:6 ] that the hot spot h - a and the knot k - ba , [ fig:5 ] and [ fig:6 ] ] in pks b1421 - 490 are significant outliers . they were reported as knots by gelbord et al .",
    "the knot k - b is very peculiar for its extreme optical output , with a ratio of knot / core optical flux @xmath94 .",
    "gelbord et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suspected that it is a core between components a and c. we find that k - b looks is a significant outlier in the figures and k - a resembles a hot spot .",
    "most recently , godfrey et al . (",
    "2009 ) confirmed that the k - b is a core and the k - a is a hot spot with vlbi observations .",
    "the @xmath11 value for the knots tends to be smaller than that of the hot spots and the @xmath10 tends to be larger , favoring the idea that the hot spots are jet termination and knots are a part of a well - collimated jet .",
    "however , the @xmath11 and @xmath10 for some hot spots are comparable to that of the knots , making uncertainty on identifying a component as a knot or a hot spot . for example , the north - east double hot spots in 3c 351 , which locate at the outer boundary of a lobe , have relativistic motion feature , hence may be identified as knots of the jet ( harris & krawczynski 2006 ) .",
    "the synchrotron radiation in the optical band indicates that there are relativistic electrons existed in these extended regions ( roser & meisenheimer 1987 ; l@xmath95hteenmki & valtaoja 1999 ) .",
    "moreover , the x - ray emission of some sources may be also synchrotron radiation as mentioned in  3.1 . assuming a magnetic field strength @xmath96 g",
    ", one can estimate the energy of relativistic electrons is @xmath97 , which contribute to the optical emission by synchrotron process .",
    "these electrons may interact with the synchrotron photons and external field photons to produce very high energy @xmath52-ray photons by ic scattering . as shown in figure 1 ,",
    "both the ssc and ic / cmb models predict a prominent gev - tev component in the seds of some sources .",
    "we check if the predicted gev - tev emission can be detectable with h.e.s.s . and _",
    "fermi_/lat , and also show the sensitivity curves of h.e.s.s . and _",
    "fermi_/lat in figure 1 for these sources .",
    "the detections of these high energy emission would place much stronger constraints on the radiation mechanisms and on the physical parameters of these sources .",
    "the origin of the high energy tev gamma - ray emission is also a debating issue , and detections of these high energy emission would drastically improved our view of the universe ( see cui 2009 for a review ) .",
    "note that our one - single zone lepton models can not explain the observed seds for the four knots in 3c 273 ( k - c1 , k - c2 , k - d1 , and k - d2h3 ) .",
    "jester et al . (",
    "2006 ) had reported that the x - ray spectra rule out the single - zone model of x - ray emission for some jet knots in 3c 273 .",
