    "when galaxies with central black holes merge , dynamical friction will drive the holes toward the center of the remnant , creating a black hole binary .",
    "if the binary separation @xmath0 becomes small enough that gravitational wave emission is significant , the binary will rapidly coalesce .",
    "the primary mechanism for reducing @xmath0 is three - body interactions : stars with orbits passing close to the binary are scattered to high velocities , allowing the binary s orbit to decay @xcite .",
    "the timescale for removing stars from low angular momentum orbits ( the `` loss cone '' ) via gravitational slingshot is much shorter than the ( collisional ) timescale for repopulating the loss cone in a spherical galaxy @xcite .",
    "the latter is many gyr or longer @xcite , implying that the decay of the binary would stall before gravitational waves become important .",
    "recent work has found that a number of processes can increase the hardening rate : brownian motion of the binary @xcite , triaxiality of the stellar bulge @xcite , interaction with a massive accretion disk ( armitage & natarajan 2002 ) , and re - ejection of previously ejected stars @xcite all may help the binary coalesce .",
    "coalescing black hole binaries radiate gravitational waves that carry away energy and both angular and linear momentum .",
    "the remnant black hole then receives a recoil velocity @xmath1 in the range of 100 to 500 km / s @xcite .",
    "the black hole can therefore either leave the host galaxy ( if @xmath2 ) or oscillate around the center of the galaxy , its orbit decaying due to dynamical friction .",
    "radiation recoil has a number of astrophysical implications , from constraining the growth of high - redshift quasars to the possibility of an intergalactic population of massive black holes @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use numerical experiments to study the reaction of stellar bulges to coalescing black holes at their centers ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "we perform n - body simulations to follow the evolution of a stellar bulge containing a central supermassive black hole that has been given a recoil velocity immediately following a binary coalescence .",
    "the ( purely gravity ) simulations are performed using gadget @xcite , a publicly available n - body tree code .",
    "we generate initial conditions using the equilibrium distribution function for a spherical stellar system with a central black hole @xcite . since dark matter contributes a small fraction of the mass in the inner tens of parsecs of a typical elliptical galaxy , we ignore its contribution in our simulations .",
    "we use the @xcite model for the stellar system ; this model is attractive because of its simple form and the fact that in projection it closely resembles the de vaucouleurs @xmath3 surface brightness law .",
    "furthermore , energy transfer from orbital decay of a black hole binary to surrounding stars is expected to transform dense cusps associated with the growth of a black hole to profiles no steeper than @xmath4 @xcite , so an @xmath5 cusp serves as an upper limit for the expected stellar distribution around a coalescing black hole binary .",
    "the density profile of the hernquist model is given by @xmath6 with total mass @xmath7 and scale radius @xmath8 , related to the half - mass radius by @xmath9 .",
    "the escape velocity from the center of the system and the dynamical time and circular velocity at the scale radius are given by : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "we consider only spherically symmetric , isotropic models , in which case the phase - space distribution function depends on energy alone and can be calculated from eddington s formula @xcite : @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the negative of the gravitational potential , @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the binding energy per unit mass ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we note that without a central black hole ( @xmath18 ) , the only accessible energies are @xmath19 and @xmath20 is analytic . adding a black hole allows particles to have @xmath21 and @xmath20 must be computed numerically .",
    "we initialize particle positions from the mass profile , and then obtain each particle s energy from the calculated distribution function : @xmath22 .    in the presence of a central point mass",
    ", @xmath20 is not a monotonic function of energy ( see @xcite for plots of @xmath20 for several values of @xmath23 ) .",
    "stability to radial perturbations must therefore be determined numerically .",
    "we have tested that our simulations ( without black hole recoil ) indeed maintain equilibrium for many dynamical times .",
    "such systems are expected to evolve on the two - body relaxation timescale @xcite , forming a @xmath24 cusp on small scales @xcite , but the relaxation time is of order @xmath25 years or longer in a typical elliptical galaxy , much longer than the timescales relevant to this paper .",
    "we set the black hole to stellar bulge mass ratio to be @xmath26 and simulate cases with @xmath1 both above and below @xmath27 for comparison .",
    "we use @xmath28 equal - mass particles to represent the stellar bulge , and a force softening of @xmath29 that allows us to resolve down to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the sphere of influence of the black hole given by @xmath32 ( a definition equivalent to the standard @xmath33 for a singular isothermal sphere ) .",
    "@xmath31 is typically a small fraction of the scale radius of the stellar system , e.g. , @xmath34 for @xmath26 .",
    "since gravity is the only physics in the simulations , our results can be interpreted at different length and mass scales by rescaling : for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , take @xmath37 and @xmath38 . for reference , a model with stellar mass @xmath39 and a scale radius of @xmath40 pc has @xmath41=1.15 myr , @xmath42 km / s , @xmath43 km / s , and a projected central velocity dispersion at one - eighth the effective radius @xmath44 of @xmath45 km / s .",
    "a consequence of gravitational radiation recoil is evolution of the density profile @xmath46 of the stellar system .",
    "[ rho2 ] compares @xmath46 at three epochs soon after the recoil of the black hole . within @xmath47 after the black hole leaves the central region of the bulge , @xmath46 flattens substantially .",
    "a core of @xmath48 forms and remains for the entire length of the simulation .    ) after the black hole ( with @xmath26 ) recoils ( at @xmath49 ) .",
    "three simulations are compared : recoil velocities above ( dashed ) and below ( dotted ) the bulge escape velocity @xmath50 , and a test model in which the hole is removed instantly at @xmath49 ( diamond ) .",
    "all three runs produce a density core inside @xmath48 within @xmath51 after the recoil ; @xmath52 evolves little afterwards , so for clarity we offset @xmath52 at 0.43 and 0.87 @xmath53 by a factor of 3 and 8 . for reference ,",
    "if @xmath54 and @xmath40 pc , @xmath41=1.15 myr and @xmath55 pc . ]    three primary mechanisms could contribute to the rapid flattening of the inner stellar density profile : ( 1 ) departure of stars bound to the black hole ; ( 2 ) energy deposition due to dynamical friction on the black hole ; and ( 3 ) re - equilibration of the stellar system due to the departure of the black hole .",
    "we discuss each one in turn .    in process 1 , some stars move with the black hole as it recoils from the galactic nucleus .",
    "the mass of stars @xmath56 bound to the black hole is a strongly decreasing function of the recoil velocity : for @xmath57 , our simulations yield @xmath58 ( 0.769 , 0.394 , 0.249 , 0.0157 , 0.0012 ) .",
    "the removal of stars bound to the recoiling black hole is therefore too small to account for the mass deficit of @xmath59 seen in the simulations .",
    "dynamical heating due to energy transferred to stars from the decay of the black hole s orbit ( process 2 ) is relatively slow .",
    "the heating timescale is @xmath60 , which is about @xmath61 ( in the @xmath62 run ) given that the change in the black hole energy from start to apocenter is @xmath63 and that the time required for the black hole to reach apocenter is @xmath64 . in comparison , fig .",
    "[ rho2 ] shows core development over a much shorter timescale ( @xmath65 ) , indicating that dynamical friction heating is not the dominant process in the _ initial _ core formation .",
    "its longer term effect will be discussed below .",
    "for the same runs as in fig .  1 .",
    "for @xmath66 , the density profile remains constant once the hole leaves the galactic nucleus , while for @xmath67 there is both early evolution as the stellar bulge dynamically adjusts to the absence of the hole and later evolution due to dynamical friction heating as the black hole returns to the center of the stellar system . ]    to study the effects due to process 3 , we first note that the timescale for the stellar system to re - adjust after the black hole ejection is the crossing time of the core , which is @xmath68 for a core of @xmath69 shown in fig .",
    "this timescale is comparable to the core formation time of @xmath70 ; the stellar system therefore has sufficient time to respond to the black hole kick by producing the observed flattening of @xmath46 .",
    "we test the hypothesis that process 3 dominates the early evolution of the stellar system by performing a simulation in which we remove the black hole instantaneously from an initial equilibrium configuration and then allow the system to evolve to its new equilibrium ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "this test eliminates evolution due to gravitational interactions between the black hole and the stars and mimics the effect of @xmath71 .",
    "[ rho2 ] compares the stellar @xmath46 for this model with the @xmath62 and @xmath72 simulations .",
    "this figure shows that at early times , all three simulations behave quite similarly ; in fact , @xmath46 is virtually indistinguishable at both 0.087 and 0.43 @xmath41 .",
    "this supports the hypothesis that dynamical adjustment to the absence of the black hole is responsible for the initial core formation .",
    "the longer - term evolution of the stellar density distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ rho1 ] . for the run where the black hole escapes ( @xmath73 ) , @xmath46 is essentially unchanged from @xmath74 up to the end of our simulation at @xmath75 , at which point the black hole is more than @xmath76 from the center of the stellar system .",
    "the evolution is qualitatively different , however , if the black hole returns .",
    "for @xmath62 , the core density at 0.87 @xmath41  is higher than that with @xmath2 .",
    "this effect is due to the presence of the black hole ( and the stars bound to it ) on its return path through the center of the system .",
    "subsequently , however , the core becomes less dense relative to the @xmath77 run , at both 1.74 and 3.48 @xmath41 . from 3.48 @xmath41  onwards , @xmath46 of the @xmath62 run is essentially unchanged and the black hole is nearly stationary at the center of the stellar potential . in both simulations , the velocity dispersion tensor remains isotropic and the bulge remains mostly spherical .",
    "simulation ( dotted curves ) with a calculation in which the hole is instantaneously removed at @xmath49 and re - introduced at @xmath78 .",
    "the results highlight the role of dynamical friction : the static re - introduction of a black hole to the core causes the re - building of a central cusp by @xmath79 , while the true simulation shows core - formation by dynamical friction heating as the hole returns to the galactic center . ]    to explore the origin of the additional flattening in the @xmath62 calculation , we perform a control simulation in which we re - introduce the black hole into the `` instantaneous removal '' simulation at 0.87 @xmath41 . in this case ,",
    "dynamical friction is irrelevant ( as in the instantaneous removal simulation ) but the stellar system re - adjusts because of the black hole .",
    "[ plot6 ] shows that the equilibrium profile attained after re - addition of the black hole is significantly steeper than that found in the @xmath62 simulation at @xmath79 .",
    "this comparison test shows that the additional flattening seen in the @xmath62 run is due to the heating of the stellar system by the black hole as dynamical friction returns it to the center of the galaxy . even though this input of energy is less than 1/1000 of the total energy of the initial stellar system ( for @xmath62 ) , it is enough to ensure that the new equilibrium differs substantially from the original at small radii .",
    "the results of this section show that for recoil velocities @xmath80 , a steep density cusp is difficult to maintain in a stellar system containing a coalescing black hole binary ( simulations with @xmath81 show little change in the density profile of the bulge ) .",
    "we now turn to the implications of these results .",
    "in a hierarchical cosmology , mergers of galaxies with central black holes will lead to the formation of black hole binaries .",
    "this process occurs on timescales significantly shorter than the hubble time only in the case of major mergers , where the mass ratio of the two galaxies is within a factor of about 3 @xcite .",
    "if the timescale for coalescence of the binary black holes is shorter than the typical time between galaxy mergers , it is likely that gravitational radiation recoil will have interesting observational consequences , most notably for early type galaxies .",
    "observations of early - type galaxies show that their density profiles fall into two distinct classes @xcite .",
    "power law galaxies , which tend to be faint , have surface brightness profiles that are steep and do not seem to exhibit a significant break at small radii .",
    "core galaxies are generally brighter and have a discernible break in their surface brightness profiles .",
    "faber et al .",
    "( 1997 ) discuss several possibilities for the origin of core galaxies .",
    "in particular , they and others have argued that the formation of a black hole binary can produce a core in a stellar system , both by gravitational slingshot of stars during the decay of the binary and by brownian motion of the binary @xcite .",
    "this process of central density reduction due to loss cone depletion should be ubiquitous in galaxies with binary black holes , reducing their central cusps to @xmath4 or shallower .",
    "we have demonstrated in this paper that in addition to these mechanisms for core formation , gravitational recoil in the predicted velocity range of 100 to 500 km / s generically results in the formation a core in the density profile of a stellar system , which produces a core in the surface brightness analogous to that seen in bright ellipticals .",
    "( we note that the late - time _ volume _",
    "density profiles in figs .",
    "[ rho2]-[plot6 ] also yield _ surface _ densities that are nearly flat inside @xmath82 but do not affect the projected aperture velocity dispersions noticeably . ) for recoil velocities @xmath83 ( for the hernquist model ) , which are rare for milky way size bulges or larger but plausible for smaller galaxies , we expect the black hole recoil to produce stellar cores that are largely independent of @xmath1 since stellar re - equilibration is the dominant process . for @xmath84 ,",
    "however , recoils of a given @xmath1 have a larger effect on the inner stellar profile in smaller galaxies because @xmath85 is larger .",
    "in addition , black holes that do not escape their host galaxy tend to create larger cores via dynamical friction than black holes that do escape . in the context of these results",
    ", it is thus the existence of power law galaxies that must be explained .",
    "indeed , one might naively have predicted that smaller , fainter galaxies would have proportionally larger cores ( in units of @xmath31 ) because of gravitational recoil , contrary to what is observed .",
    "one resolution of this difficulty is that black holes are rare in low - mass galaxies .",
    "the dynamical constraints on black holes in such galaxies are indeed rather poor , though there are suggestive hints of substantial population of @xmath86 black holes in dwarf seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are also plausible mechanisms that could rebuild a cusp .",
    "a natural explanation for reforming a power - law surface brightness profile is star formation accompanying a dissipative merger of gas - rich galaxies .",
    "this scenario requires the black hole binary to coalesce  and the recoiling hole to return to the galactic nucleus  _ before _ the starburst is completed . if stellar dynamical processes alone are responsible for hardening the binary , the timescale is typically @xmath87 years even in the case of highly triaxial galaxies @xcite .",
    "this is comparable to , or somewhat longer than , the expected duration of a merger - triggered starburst ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that the presence of substantial amounts of gas can greatly reduce the time for binary black holes to coalesce .",
    "if this is the case , as argued by , e.g. , armitage & natarajan ( 2002 ) and @xcite , then it is plausible that a black hole binary can coalesce before the end of a starburst and a stellar cusp can be re - formed , thus helping explain the existence of power - law early - type galaxies that are built hierarchically .",
    "we note that , given this scenario , in future work it would be interesting to consider the dynamics of recoiling holes in the presence of a surrounding accretion disk .",
