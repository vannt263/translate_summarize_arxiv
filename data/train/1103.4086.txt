    "the wiretap channel was introduced by wyner @xcite as a discrete memoryless broadcast channel where the sender , alice , transmits confidential messages to a legitimate receiver bob , in the presence of an eavesdropper eve .",
    "wyner defined the perfect secrecy capacity as the maximum amount of information that alice can send to bob while insuring that eve gets a negligible amount of information .",
    "he also described a generic coding strategy known as coset coding , used to encode together both data and random bits to confuse the eavesdropper .",
    "the question of determining the secrecy capacity of many classes of channels has been addressed extensively recently , yielding a plethora of information theoretical results on secrecy capacity @xcite .",
    "there is a sharp contrast with the situation of wiretap code designs , where very little is known .",
    "ozarow and wyner proposed the so - called wire - tap ii codes @xcite for a scenario where the channel to bob is a noiseless binary channel , while eve experiences erasures .",
    "recently polar wiretap codes have been proposed for symmetric binary input channels @xcite .",
    "the most exploited approach to get practical codes so far has been to use ldpc codes , for binary erasure and symmetric channels ( for example @xcite ) , but also for gaussian channels with binary inputs @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we consider lattice codes for gaussian channels , where alice uses lattice coset encoding .",
    "lattice codes for gaussian channels have been considered from an information theoretical point of view in @xcite , we focus here on a code design criterion , which we derive from minimizing eve s probability of correctly decoding .",
    "an asymptotic study of the secrecy gain and wiretap lattice codes are further presented .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : model ] recalls the channel model , how lattice coset encoding is performed , while section [ sec : proba ] contains an analysis of eve s probability of correctly decoding , from which design criteria are deduced .",
    "the notion of secrecy gain is defined , illustrated and interpreted in section [ sec : the - secrecy - gain ] .",
    "it is further analyzed for even unimodular lattices in section [ sec : unimodular ] . the asymptotic analysis which describes the behavior of the secrecy gain when the lattice dimension grows",
    "is presented in section [ sec : asymptotic - analysis ] .",
    "finally some wiretap lattice codes can be found in section [ sec : wiretap ] .",
    "we consider a gaussian wiretap channel , that is , a broadcast channel where the source ( alice ) sends a signal to a legitimate receiver ( bob ) , while an illegitimate eavesdropper ( eve ) can listen to the transmission .",
    "it is modeled by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the transmitted signal , @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the gaussian noise at bob , respectively eve s side , both with zero mean , and respective variance @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( see figure [ fig : wiretap - gaussian ] ) .",
    "we assume that alice knows bob s channel , that is @xmath6 , as well as eve s channel , @xmath7 , though we will also show how to handle the case where eve s channel is unknown ( see section [ sec : wiretap ] ) .     the gaussian wiretap channel between the sender alice , and the two receivers bob and eve.,width=302 ]    alice s encoder maps @xmath8 bits @xmath9 from @xmath10 to a codeword @xmath11 , and over a transmission of @xmath12 symbols , we get @xmath13    we consider the case where alice uses lattice codes , namely @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is an @xmath12-dimensional real lattice ( we use the subscript @xmath16 to refer to the intended legitimate receiver bob )",
    ". she then encodes her @xmath8 bits into a point @xmath14 : @xmath17 note that since alice encodes a finite number @xmath8 of bits per codeword , she needs to choose a finite subset of @xmath15 .",
    "the problem of finding a shaping region @xmath18 is not addressed here .",
    "we recall for the sake of completeness that a lattice @xmath19 is a discrete set of points in @xmath20 , which can be described in terms of its generator matrix @xmath21 by @xcite @xmath22 for any lattice point @xmath23 of a lattice @xmath24 , its voronoi cell is defined by @xmath25 all voronoi cells are the same , thus @xmath26 .",
    "the volume of a lattice @xmath19 with generator matrix @xmath21 is by definition the volume @xmath27 of a voronoi cell , that is @xmath28      in order to confuse the eavesdropper , we use coset coding , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "the idea is that instead of having a one - to - one correspondence between a vector of information bits and a lattice point , this vector of information bits is mapped to a set of codewords , namely a coset , after which the point to be actually transmitted is chosen randomly inside the coset .",
    "consequently , @xmath29 bits ( @xmath30 ) of @xmath31 will carry the information and @xmath32 bits , the randomness .",
    "more precisely , we partition",
    "the lattice @xmath15 into a union of disjoint cosets of the form @xmath33 with @xmath34 a sublattice of @xmath15 and @xmath35 an @xmath12-dimensional vector .",
    "we need @xmath36 cosets to be labeled by the information vector @xmath37 : @xmath38 which means that @xmath39    once the mapping @xmath40 is done , alice randomly chooses a point @xmath41 and sends it over the wiretap channel .",
    "this is equivalent to choose a random vector @xmath42 .",
    "the transmitted lattice point @xmath14 is finally of the form @xmath43 we have denoted the sublattice @xmath34 , since it encodes the random bits that are there to increase eve s confusion , and is then the lattice intended for eve .",
    "the total rate @xmath44 is then @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the information bits rate intended to bob , and @xmath47 is the random bit rate , all per ( complex ) channel use : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the number of random bits .    intuitively , the meaning of this coding scheme is that we would like eve to decode perfectly the lattice @xmath34 whose points are labeled by the random bits .",
    "this corresponds to the information - theoretic approach @xcite where it is shown that the secrecy capacity is equal to the difference between bob s capacity and eve s and thus , it is desirable that eve s capacity is wasted in decoding random bits .",
    "assume that the channel between alice and eve is corrupted by an additive uniform noise .",
    "even though this is not a realistic channel this perfectly illustrates the coset coding strategy .",
    "we will see that , in this case , it is enough to consider the @xmath50 lattice .",
    "coset coding with uniform noise : @xmath51 with @xmath52.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   coset coding with uniform noise : @xmath51 with @xmath52.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   coset coding with uniform noise : @xmath51 with @xmath52.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    consider the one - dimensional case ( see figure [ fig : uniform ] ) where alice sends one point @xmath53 .",
    "eve receives @xmath54 where @xmath55 is uniformly distributed over the interval @xmath56 $ ] for some @xmath57 , as shown on the upper left figure [ fig : uniform ] . to confuse eve , alice performs coset coding as follows :    * she performs the euclidean division @xmath58 + where the quotient @xmath59 carries the random symbols while the remainder @xmath49 carries the data .",
    "* she encodes random symbols using points in @xmath60 ( the quotient @xmath59 ) while data symbols are mapped to elements of @xmath61 ( the remainder @xmath49 ) .",
    "this is illustrated in the upper right and the lower parts of figure [ fig : uniform ] .",
    "now , as it can be seen in figure [ fig : uniform ] , eve is able to detect with a zero - error probability the value of @xmath59 in equation ( [ eq : euc - div ] ) while all possible values of @xmath49 will be detected with probability @xmath62 .",
    "this means that random symbols will be detected error - free when the confusion will be maximal for data symbols already when we use a one - dimensional lattice ( that is @xmath63 ) .",
    "unfortunately , gaussian noise is _ not _ bounded : it _ requires _ to use @xmath64dimensional lattice codes .",

    "suppose that alice wants to encode a sorted block of @xmath86 information bits @xmath87 , where by sorted we mean that the bit order matters : the bits are ranked in decreasing order of confidentiality , that is the first bit is the most confidential .",
