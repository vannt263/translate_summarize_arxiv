    "electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots are an attractive platform for quantum computation for two reasons .",
    "one is the simple fact that this platform is compatible with the existing semiconductor electronics industry , making scalability much more feasible@xcite .",
    "the other is the possibility of faster operations compared to other platforms , such as trapped ions or atoms and qubits based on superconducting circuits .",
    "these advantages have provided the impetus behind the substantial theoretical and experimental progress on gaas- and si - based systems that has been made over the past decade .",
    "high - fidelity single - qubit gates and control over multi - qubit arrays have been demonstrated in several different types of spin qubits , including single - spin loss - divincenzo qubits@xcite , double - dot singlet - triplet qubits@xcite , triple - dot exchange - only qubits@xcite , and `` hybrid '' qubits@xcite consisting of three electrons confined in a double quantum dot .",
    "universal quantum computation requires not only high - fidelity initialization , readout , and single - qubit gates , but two - qubit entangling gates as well .",
    "while there has also been progress in achieving the latter@xcite , with two - qubit gate fidelities as high as 90% reported in recent work@xcite , fidelities have not yet reached the thresholds necessary for quantum error correction schemes@xcite .",
    "this is due in large part to decoherence caused by environmental noise .",
    "the two main sources of noise are magnetic field noise , hereafter referred to simply as `` field noise '' , due to both nuclear spins in the host semiconductor ( overhauser noise)@xcite and fluctuations in the applied magnetic field , and charge noise due to charge fluctuations on nearby impurities or on the electrostatic gates used to confine electrons , leading to noise in the exchange coupling between the spins@xcite .",
    "field noise is especially large in gaas ; in fact , it is the dominant source of noise in this material and can not be eliminated as the only stable isotopes of ga and as have nonzero nuclear spin .",
    "however , its effects can be considerably reduced by dynamical decoupling@xcite or bayesian estimation of hamiltonian parameters@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "field noise is less of a problem in si ; of the three stable isotopes , only @xmath1si has a nonzero nuclear spin , and the concentration of this isotope can be greatly reduced via isotopic purification@xcite .",
    "however , charge noise continues to be a serious problem in si , and the field noise arising from fluctuations in the applied magnetic field remains an issue .",
    "developing a theoretical understanding of the effects of noise on entanglement creation in a system of two spin qubits is therefore of great importance for future progress in building a semiconductor - based quantum computer .",
    "however , a systematic investigation of these effects has not been conducted previously .",
    "a number of works have introduced dynamical noise - suppression techniques , such as the dynamical decoupling and bayesian estimation methods mentioned above , as well as dynamically corrected gates@xcite , which partially cancel out the effects of noise by applying carefully designed pulse sequences .",
    "in addition , several works have studied the decoherence of an initially prepared entangled state of two or more qubits subject to various types of noise@xcite .",
    "there has also been some theoretical work on the dynamics of two coupled electron spins under a constant exchange coupling and applied magnetic field gradient .",
    "two early treatments@xcite mostly focused on field noise , but included a limited discussion of charge noise as well .",
    "in more recent works , we have studied the effects of noise on single - qubit coherence@xcite and on the state preservation of two exchange - coupled qubits@xcite . however",
    ", none of these works provides a comprehensive analysis of how noise limits entanglement generation in two - spin - qubit systems subject to realistic noise .",
    "the question of how much noise is tolerable in the implementation of two - qubit gates at the error correction threshold remains unknown .",
    "the goal of the present work is to address this question , which is obviously of vital importance if semiconductor spin quantum computing is going to be a practical reality in the future .",
    "most of the aforementioned works make use of the quasistatic bath approximation@xcite in which the noise is modeled by averaging the return probability over a gaussian distribution of magnetic fields and exchange couplings .",
    "this model works well in the context of semiconductor spin qubits because the noise fluctuations are slow compared to qubit operation times.@xcite thus , although the actual noise has frequency dependence@xcite , the decoherence process can still be captured with a quasistatic noise model@xcite .",
    "we employ this model throughout this work .",
    "the objective of our work is to calculate the fidelity of entanglement generation of two heisenberg - coupled electron spins in the presence of field and charge noise , starting from the `` classical '' unentangled state @xmath2 .",
    "suppose we allow the system to evolve from this initial state under the heisenberg hamiltonian with no magnetic field gradient , i.e. , under the influence of the exchange coupling @xmath3 alone .",
    "in the complete absence of noise , the system will evolve into one of two maximally - entangled states , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , after times @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the fidelities for producing these states are closely related to an intrinsic two - qubit coherence time , which we denote by @xmath8 , and to the steady - state return probability .",
    "we emphasize that this @xmath8 , to be defined precisely in sec .",
    "iib below , is not the same as the free induction decay time for a single electron spin  this is a two - electron property ( the @xmath9 in the subscript of @xmath8 here refers to two qubits or two coupled spins ) that measures the suppression of entanglement creation between the two qubits . for the ideal entangling operation , the return probability oscillates in time about @xmath10 with an amplitude of @xmath10 .",
    "both the average ( steady - state ) value and the amplitude of oscillations are important for quantifying the maximum amount of entanglement that can be generated .",
    "the intrinsic coherence time is a measure of the decay rate of the oscillation amplitude of the return probability under the influence of disorder , and is thus a measure of the time scale over which one can maximally entangle two electron spins .",
    "the steady - state value of the return probability can also be influenced by noise , and deviations away from @xmath10 will lead to a further , time - independent reduction of entanglement .",
    "our results can be used to determine to what extent the noise must be reduced in order to achieve two - qubit entanglement fidelities that exceed quantum error correction thresholds .",
    "we also calculate the fidelities for producing the states , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which are defined as the disorder - averaged probabilities that , after performing the operations that , ideally , would evolve the system from the unentangled @xmath2 state to these maximally - entangled states , we will measure the system to be in the appropriate state@xcite .",
    "our main findings are as follows .",
    "we find that the coherence time decreases as we increase either type of noise , but that charge noise has a noticeably greater effect . as a very important check",
    ", we find that , in the absence of magnetic disorder , the coherence time is inversely proportional to the charge noise strength for low disorder , in agreement with the quasistatic bath approximation@xcite ; the fact that this is only approximate in our case is due to the fact that we only allow for positive exchange coupling strengths , consistent with the experimental situation in exchange - coupled semiconductor spin systems .",
    "we also find that , in general , in the complete absence of field noise , the steady - state return probability is always @xmath10 .",
    "this means that one can still achieve maximal entanglement as long as the operation is done over a time scale much shorter than @xmath8 . if there is any field noise , however , then the steady - state return probability is larger than @xmath10 , leading to a reduction in the entanglement fidelity regardless of how quickly the entanglement is generated .",
    "our results for the entangled state fidelities follow a somewhat different trend to that of @xmath8we find that whereas @xmath8 is much more sensitive to charge noise than field noise , the entanglement fidelity for preparing state @xmath11 is essentially equally sensitive to both types of noise . on the other hand , the fidelity for preparing @xmath12 is affected less by field noise than by charge noise .",
    "this follows from the basic observation that it takes three times longer to prepare @xmath12 combined with the fact that charge noise tends to dominate on longer time scales .",
    "although these results would suggest that , in theory , charge noise would generally be a more severe problem for realizing a maximally - entangled state than field noise , we should note that , as mentioned before , field noise tends to be much larger than charge noise in actual experiments , at least in gaas , meaning that field noise is the dominant cause of decoherence and thus loss of entanglement fidelity by the simple virtue of being the dominant source of noise in the system .",
    "however , it is possible to mitigate the effects of field noise by increasing the exchange coupling .",
    "if we quantify the strengths of the two types of noise present in the system by the standard deviations of their respective distributions , @xmath13 for field noise and @xmath14 for charge noise , then we will find that all of the quantities we calculate depend on the noise strengths only in the dimensionless combinations , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mean of the exchange - coupling distribution .",
    "it has been shown that as @xmath17 is increased , @xmath13 remains approximately constant , while @xmath14 increases roughly linearly.@xcite thus , even though field noise is strong in gaas , it is possible to mitigate its effects by simply increasing the exchange coupling , leaving charge noise as the main contributor to loss of entanglement fidelity .",
    "this observation suggests that comparable entanglement fidelities can be achieved in both gaas and si systems , even when isotopic purification is employed in the latter case , as one can reduce the effective dimensionless field noise even in gaas simply by increasing the exchange coupling strength .",
    "of course , single qubit operations ( i.e. spin rotations ) are also directly affected by field noise , but powerful dynamical decoupling techniques could mitigate field noise effects on single qubit operations . in the current work ,",
    "we focus entirely on 2-qubit exchange gate operations as the subject of single qubit operations for semiconductor spin qubit systems have already been studied rather exhaustively both theoretically and experimentally with single qubit fidelity already reaching @xmath18 in some situations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we review the heisenberg hamiltonian from which our results ultimately derive , review the known results for the eigenstates , eigenenergies , and return probability , and define the disorder average and intrinsic coherence time . sec .",
    "iii is dedicated to our main results for the steady - state return probability , coherence time , and fidelity .",
    "we first give results in the limits of no field noise and no charge noise , showing that we can obtain some purely analytical results in these limits .",
    "we then give our exact numerical results for the general case in which both types of noise are present .",
    "we give our conclusions in sec .  iv .",
    "in this section , we review the hamiltonian and eigenstates of the two - spin heisenberg model , as well as the return probability and magnetization for the system starting from a `` classical '' unentangled @xmath2 state .",
    "we also give our definition of the intrinsic coherence time , @xmath8 , which we will be using throughout this paper .",
    "our hamiltonian is that of two electron spins coupled via a disordered heisenberg exchange coupling subject to magnetic fields@xcite : @xmath19 here , we take the magnetic fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 to have gaussian distributions with a mean of @xmath22 and standard deviation @xmath13 , hereafter called the `` strength '' of the disorder , @xmath23 and the exchange coupling to have a truncated gaussian distribution ( i.e. , we restrict @xmath3 to non - negative values ) with a mean of @xmath17 and standard deviation @xmath14 , @xmath24 this hamiltonian conserves the @xmath25 component of the total spin , @xmath26 ; we will focus on the @xmath27 subspace from this point on , as there is only one eigenstate in each of the @xmath28 subspaces , and therefore the dynamics of the system within these subspaces will be trivial .",
    "the effective hamiltonian describing the @xmath27 subspace is @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "this hamiltonian is written in the @xmath2 and @xmath31 basis , with the former being the `` top '' component of our spinors .",
    "our subsequent calculations will be simplified by noting that the distribution of @xmath32 is also gaussian , with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath33 : @xmath34 diagonalizing the effective hamiltonian@xcite , one finds that the energy eigenvalues are @xmath35 and the associated eigenstates are @xmath36 let us now consider initializing the system in the @xmath2 state .",

    "\\label{eq : disorderavg}\\ ] ] in general , this average must be evaluated numerically ; however , as we will see below , there are special cases in which it is possible to obtain analytical results .",
    "we now define the intrinsic coherence time , @xmath8 .",
    "we will see below that the disorder - averaged return probability shows oscillations that decay in amplitude , tending toward a steady - state value .",
    "we define @xmath8 as the time that it takes for the amplitude of these oscillations about the steady - state value to decay to @xmath42 times the initial amplitude .",
    "we wish to emphasize two points about @xmath8 .",
    "first , this definition is purely operational  it is independent of the detailed time dependence of the amplitude and is used purely for convenience .",
    "any other reasonable definition of @xmath8 will result in the same conclusions .",
    "second , @xmath8 here is not related to the free - induction decay time of a single qubit ",
    "rather , it is a two - qubit property , as already emphasized in the introduction .",
    "it is a measure of the rate at which our ability to entangle the two qubits is suppressed as the time scale of entanglement generation is increased .",
    "also note that the dimensionless number @xmath43 gives the number of coherent oscillations exhibited in the return probability before it decays .",
    "we may connect this decay of the oscillation amplitude of the return probability to entanglement of the two electron spins as follows .",
    "let us first consider the case with no noise and no magnetic field gradient . in this case , we find that the return probability is just the oscillatory function , @xmath44 we therefore see that the return probability oscillates around @xmath10 with an amplitude of @xmath10 .",
    "if we let the system evolve for a time @xmath6 , then the return probability will be exactly @xmath10 , while the state of the system will be the maximally - entangled state , @xmath45 which differs from the singlet and triplet states by only single - qubit operations .",
    "we may also realize a maximally - entangled state by evolving the system for a time @xmath7 ; in this case , we obtain @xmath46 we thus see that a return probability of the form given in eq",
    ".   indicates an operation that is capable of producing a maximally - entangled state .",
    "these operations are in fact @xmath47 gates up to single - qubit rotations .",
    "any deviations from this form , whether due to the amplitude decaying or due to a shift in the value about which the probability oscillates , indicate a reduction in our ability to produce such maximal entanglement .",
    "therefore , one may view @xmath8 as an operationally defined characteristic time scale over which the two - qubit entanglement decays .",
    "we now present our results for the disorder - averaged return probability @xmath48_{\\alpha}$ ] and the intrinsic coherence times @xmath8 extracted from it .",
    "we first present the general formula for the return probability , and then show that , in the @xmath49 and @xmath50 limits , we can obtain some closed - form analytical results .",
    "if we substitute eq .   into eq .  , use the trigonometric identity , @xmath51 , and rewrite in terms of the real part of a complex - valued expression , we obtain    @xmath52_{\\alpha}&=&1-\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma_h\\sigma_j\\sqrt{2}\\left [ 1+\\mbox{erf}\\left ( \\frac{j_0}{\\sigma_j\\sqrt{2}}\\right ) \\right ] } \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}d(\\delta h)\\,\\int_0^{\\infty}dj\\,\\frac{j^2}{j^2+(\\delta h)^2}e^{-(\\delta h)^2/4\\sigma_h^2}e^{-(j - j_0)^2/2\\sigma_j^2 } \\cr & + & \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma_h\\sigma_j\\sqrt{2}\\left [ 1+\\mbox{erf}\\left ( \\frac{j_0}{\\sigma_j\\sqrt{2}}\\right ) \\right ] } \\mbox{re}\\left [ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}d(\\delta h)\\,\\int_0^{\\infty}dj\\,\\frac{j^2}{j^2+(\\delta h)^2}e^{-(\\delta h)^2/4\\sigma_h^2}e^{-(j - j_0)^2/2\\sigma_j^2}e^{i\\sqrt{j^2+(\\delta h)^2}t}\\right ] .",

    "we see that , in this limit , the return probability has a gaussian decay towards its steady - state value .",
    "we can now simply read off the value of @xmath8 , obtaining @xmath68 for small @xmath14 ( @xmath69 ) , we thus see that our approximation is justified , though it will begin to break down for larger @xmath14 .",
    "we have thus recovered the result for @xmath8 found in the quasistatic bath approximation@xcite .",
    "note that , unlike in the treatment of ref .  , we truncate the gaussian distribution to positive values of the exchange coupling only .",
    "if we had not done so , then the above formula would in fact be exact .",
    "we should note that , because the return probability oscillates around @xmath10 , the amplitude of the oscillations must initially be @xmath10 because the probability at @xmath70 is @xmath71 .",

    "we may break down the effects caused directly by these two types of noise contributing to the decrease in fidelity as follows .",
    "charge noise has a single effect , namely , to cause a decay of the amplitude of the oscillations in the return probability ; it has no effect on the steady - state value of the return probability .",
    "field noise also damps out the oscillations in the return probability , but a given amount of field noise will have less of an effect on it than the same amount of charge noise would .",
    "however , field noise has a second effect  it also increases the steady - state return probability .",
    "this , too , is harmful to the creation of a maximally - entangled state .",
    "overall , we see that these effects result in an @xmath120 that is just as adversely affected by a given amount of field noise as by the same amount of charge noise , but @xmath123 is affected more strongly by charge noise than by field noise . however , we see that field noise affects @xmath123 even more strongly than it does the `` quality factor '' @xmath106 described earlier .",
    "this shows that the damping of the oscillations of the return probability is not the only phenomenon that affects the entanglement fidelity  the fact that the return probability , and thus the initial amplitude of the return probability oscillations , differ from @xmath10 also has an effect .",
    "we should note , however , in light of the above discussion that , in actual gaas experimental setups , the field noise is much larger in magnitude than charge noise , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fidelity_gen ] .",
    "this indicates that , at least in practice , field noise is a bigger problem for entanglement in gaas simply because it is the dominant source of noise in the system . even in this case",
    ", we may still reduce the effect of field noise by increasing @xmath17note that the fidelity , like the return probability and @xmath8 , depends on the strength of the two types of noise only in the combinations , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "it turns out that , as we tune @xmath17 , @xmath13 remains constant , while @xmath14 increases roughly linearly@xcite .",
    "this means that , while we can not reduce the effect of charge noise by simply increasing the exchange coupling , we can reduce the effect of field noise .",
    "this is especially helpful for gaas systems since one can not eliminate field noise through isotopic purification schemes as one can in si .",
    "other things being equal , however , it is obvious that si has a great advantage over gaas simply by virtue of its much lower field noise since overhauser nuclear fluctuations can be almost entirely eliminated in si , but not in gaas . on the other hand ,",
    "the advantage of having much weaker field noise in si would be seriously compromised if the charge noise in si turns out to be stronger than in gaas .",
    "we have determined the intrinsic coherence time , @xmath8 , the steady - state return probability , @xmath53 , and the fidelities @xmath120 and @xmath123 for producing the maximally - entangled states @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , starting from the unentangled state , @xmath2 , for a system of two electron spins coupled via the heisenberg exchange coupling with both magnetic field and charge noise as a function of the strength of both types of noise .",
    "we employed the quasistatic bath approximation , taking the distributions for both types of noise to be gaussian ; in the case of charge noise , we truncated the distribution so that the exchange coupling is always positive .",
    "these results are of direct and immediate relevance to current quantum computing experiments on coupled electron spins in quantum dots since we have focused on standard experimental observables ( return probability ) and used realistic noise models . in fact",
    ", we indicate the values of the disorder that have recently been estimated experimentally in our presented results@xcite .",
    "the main goal of our work is to calculate the fidelity of operations that maximally entangle two electron spins , starting from an unentangled state .",
    "this is an important problem , as universal quantum computation requires the ability to perform at least one such two - qubit operation , along with arbitrary single - qubit rotations .",
    "we find that , while both types of noise suppress @xmath8 , electronic noise has a far greater effect , indicating that charge noise is much more effective at causing decoherence in the system than field noise .",
    "we also calculate the steady - state return probability and show that only field noise has any significant effect on it . while the fact that charge noise lowers @xmath8 more than field noise would at first seem to indicate that it is much more harmful to our ability to entangle the electronic spins , the situation is more subtle in the presence of both types of noise . because charge noise does not change the steady - state return probability , our `` nave '' entangling operation still closely approximates the ideal @xmath47 entangling operation as long as it is performed over a time scale much smaller than @xmath8 .",
    "this is not the case with field noise , however  any amount of field noise will change the steady - state return probability , and thus our `` nave '' operation will deviate from the ideal @xmath47 entangling operation regardless of how quickly it is performed .",
    "we thus expect that field noise is more harmful to performing such an operation than our results for @xmath8 would suggest , and this is in fact borne out in our results for the entanglement fidelities .",
    "we find that @xmath120 is just as greatly reduced by a given magnitude of field noise as by an equal amount of charge noise . on the other hand , @xmath123 is not affected as much by field noise as it is by charge noise , but it is still reduced more than the `` quality factor '' @xmath94 is .",
    "this fact helps to illustrate the effect of the steady - state return probability shift on the fidelity .",
    "one must , however , take into account the fact that field and charge noise are typically not of comparable magnitudes in semiconductors , and thus , their actual harmful effects on two - qubit operations would depend strongly on their actual magnitudes .",
    "this is why we have presented results in this work covering wide parameter regimes for both field and charge noise strengths .",
    "our results imply that a given amount of charge noise overall has a more detrimental effect on entanglement fidelity than an equal amount of field noise .",
    "we see , however , that , at least in gaas , field noise is much stronger than charge noise , and thus is a bigger problem in this material . such noise , however , can be made much smaller in si than in gaas , since isotopic purification can greatly reduce the presence of magnetic isotopes of si ( @xmath1si , to be exact ) , while no such reduction is possible in gaas because the only stable isotopes of ga and as have non - zero spin .",
    "the same concerns about unavoidable field noise in gaas arise in p - doped si as well owing to the fact that the only stable isotope of p , @xmath137p , has a non - zero spin ; however , the field noise will not be as great as in gaas since not all of the nuclei present in the sample are magnetic .",
    "there is , however , another way to reduce the effects of field noise that works for both materials .",
    "we can take advantage of the fact that @xmath13 essentially remains constant as one changes the average exchange coupling @xmath17 , while @xmath14 is roughly linear@xcite in @xmath17 .",
    "this means that , since the fidelities and the return probability depend only on @xmath15 and @xmath16 , one can reduce the effects of field noise simply by increasing @xmath17 . in fact , as can be seen from the experimental points indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fidelity_gen ] , it is possible to achieve fidelities in excess of @xmath130 for producing the state @xmath11 or close to @xmath130 for producing @xmath12 in current gaas - based experimental setups by doing this .",
    "recent experimental work@xcite suggests that a similar approach can be used to suppress charge noise by creating a large magnetic field gradient across the double quantum dot , provided bayesian estimation or dynamical decoupling are used simultaneously to mitigate field noise .",
    "our findings indicate that if both @xmath15 and @xmath16 are reduced down to the @xmath138 level , then entanglement fidelities at or beyond surface code thresholds of @xmath18 can be achieved .",
    "our work also implies that si systems in the end are far superior to gaas in terms of achieving ideal two - qubit gate operations by virtue of the fact that in si the field noise can , in principle , be reduced to arbitrarily small values by eliminating background nuclear spin fluctuations .",
    "charge noise on the other hand is likely to be similar in both systems , and therefore , it is hard to see any inherent advantage in gaas over si whereas si obviously has a great advantage over gaas in terms of field noise .",
    "our detailed numerical results presented in this paper provide a quantitative guide on how much both types of noise must be suppressed in experimental systems for achieving the fidelities above @xmath18 that are necessary for further progress in the field .",

    "<S> we investigate the effect of magnetic field and charge noise on the generation of entanglement between two heisenberg exchange - coupled electron spins in a double quantum dot . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on exchange - driven evolution that would ideally take an initial unentangled tensor product state to a maximally - entangled state in the absence of noise . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of noise obviously adversely affects the attainment of maximal entanglement , which we study quantitatively and exactly . to quantify the effects of noise , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate two - qubit coherence times and entanglement fidelity , both of which can be extracted from simulations or measurements of the return probability as a function of interaction time , i.e. , the time period during which the exchange coupling remains effective between the two spins . </S>",
    "<S> we perform these calculations for a broad range of noise strengths that includes the regime of recent experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the two types of noise reduce the amount of entanglement in qualitatively distinct ways and that , although charge noise generally leads to faster decoherence , the relative importance of the two types of noise in entanglement creation depends sensitively on the strength of the exchange coupling . </S>",
    "<S> our results can be used to determine the level of noise suppression needed to reach quantum error correction thresholds . </S>",
    "<S> we provide quantitative guidance for the requisite noise constraints necessary to eventually reach the @xmath0 fidelity consistent with the quantum error correction threshold . </S>"
