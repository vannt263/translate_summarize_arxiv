    "cosmological observations play a crucial role in understanding our universe . with the accumulation of observational data from cmb measurements , large scale structure ( lss ) surveys and snia observations as well as the improvements of the data quality",
    ", the accurate constraints on cosmological parameters can be expected from the data analysis .",
    "recently wmap group has released the five - year data of temperature and polarization power spectra @xcite . and",
    "the arcminute cosmology bolometer array ( acbar ) experiment has also published its new cmb temperature power spectrum @xcite .",
    "these new cmb data can strengthen the constraints on the cosmological parameters , especially for those associated with the inflationary models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the supernova cosmology project has made an unified analysis of the world s supernovae datasets and presented a new compilation  union \" ( 307 sample ) @xcite which includes the recent samples of snia from snls and essence survey , as well as some older datasets . in the literature @xcite",
    ", these data has been widely used to constrain various cosmological models .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that the degeneracies of cosmological parameters exist in almost all cosmological observations , _",
    "i.e. _ , they are not sensitive to single parameters but to some specific combinations of them .",
    "it is therefore highly necessary to combine different probes to break parameter degeneracies so as to achieve tight constraints .",
    "furthermore , different observations are affected by different systematic errors , and it is thus helpful to reduce potential biases by combining different probes .",
    "weak gravitational lensing which is directly related to the dark matter distribution , the geometry and the dynamics of the universe provides an useful way to break the degeneracies mentioned above .",
    "cosmic shear , i.e. the distortion of images of the high - redshift source galaxies through the tidal gravitational field of the large - scale matter distribution in the universe , provides a powerful probe of the mass fluctuations in the universe and gives a direct measurement of the matter power spectrum down to the non - linear regime .",
    "since the mass distribution and its late time evolution are sensitive to the dark energy and the neutrino mass , we expect to get interesting information about both through the study of cosmic shear .    recently , the cosmic shear analysis of the 100 square degree weak lensing survey which includes the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtlswide)@xcite , the garching - bonn deep survey ( gabods)@xcite , the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs)@xcite , and the virmos - descart survey ( virmos)@xcite has been presented by ref.@xcite .",
    "these combined surveys cover @xmath17 which is the largest sky coverage so far . with these data ,",
    "there are some studies on the cosmological implications recently in the literature @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the constraints on cosmological parameters from the weak lensing cosmic shear as well as the current cosmological observational data , such as cmb , lss and sn ia .",
    "specifically , we focus on the effects from the weak lensing .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe the method and the latest observational datasets we use in this paper ; section iii contains our main global fitting results on the cosmological parameters and the last section is the summary .",
    "in our study , we perform a global analysis using the publicly available mcmc package cosmomc @xcite . we assume the purely adiabatic initial conditions .",
    "our most general parameter space is : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 , in which @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the physical baryon and cold dark matter densities relative to the critical density , @xmath23 is the ratio ( multiplied by 100 ) of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling , @xmath24 is the optical depth to re - ionization , @xmath25 is the dark matter neutrino fraction at present , namely , @xmath26 the primordial scalar power spectrum @xmath27 is parameterized as @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is defined as the amplitude of initial power spectrum , @xmath30 measures the spectral index , @xmath31 is the running of the scalar spectral index and @xmath32 is the tensor to scalar ratio of the primordial spectrum . for the pivot scale",

    "the @xmath3cdm model has @xmath40 and @xmath41 . for the dark energy model with a constant eos , @xmath41 ( wcdm henceforth ) . when using the global fitting strategy to constrain the cosmological parameters , it is crucial to include dark energy perturbations @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the method provided in refs.@xcite to treat the dark energy perturbations consistently in the whole parameter space in the numerical calculations .    for the weak lensing likelihood statistic",

    "in this section we present our global fitting results .",
    "the most relevant cosmological parameters for the weak gravitational lensing signal are the matter density @xmath15 and the matter power spectrum normalization parameter @xmath1 . on the other hand , other cosmological parameters related to the primordial power spectrum from inflation and the expansion history of the universe",
    "can also affect the weak lensing effects .",

    "a significant improvement from the cosmic shear data can be seen clearly .",
    "we obtain @xmath70 and @xmath71 at @xmath72 c.l . from the combined cmb , lss , sn and weak lensing cosmic shear data in @xmath3cdm model . compared with the results with no weak lensing data",
    "included , the constraints are improved by @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath15 and @xmath1 , respectively .    in the following ,",
    "we will present the constraints on the neutrino mass , the equation of state of dark energy and the parameters associated with inflation models respectively .      from the neutrino oscillation experiments , such as the atmospheric neutrino experiments @xcite and the solar neutrino experiments @xcite , we know that neutrinos are massive",
    ". therefore they can leave some unique imprints on cosmological observables , such as the cmb anisotropies and lss @xcite .",
    "thus cosmological observations can provide crucial complementary information on the absolute neutrino masses .    from the current observations assuming a flat universe .",
    "the black solid line is from data sets cmb @xmath67 lss @xmath67 sn ia , the red dashed line is obtained by taking into account the weak lensing data and the blue dash - dotted line is for the dynamical dark energy model .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    besides the influence on the expansion history of the universe , the existence of massive neutrinos affect the structure formation process .",
    "massive neutrinos contribute to the dark matter composition of the universe . because of their relatively large thermal velocities , they damp the perturbations within their free streaming scale , and suppress the matter power spectrum at small scale by roughly @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "such a suppression of the power spectrum depends on the jeans length of neutrinos , which decreases with time as the neutrino thermal velocity decreases .",
    "since the cosmic shear can measure the matter power spectrum down to small - scale non - linear regime , it can be used to significantly improve the constraint on the neutrino mass .    within the @xmath3cdm model , from table i one can read out @xmath10 upper limit of the total neutrino mass derived from the current observations , cmb+lss+sn , @xmath76 ( @xmath10 c.l . ) , which is consistent with the recent results from wmap5 group @xcite . by taking into account the weak lensing cosmic shear data ,",
    "the constraints can be tightened to @xmath77 ( @xmath10 c.l . ) .",
    "the degeneracies between the neutrino mass and other cosmological parameters , such as the eos of dark energy @xcite and the running of spectral index @xcite , are known to exist .",
    "we thus also consider the neutrino mass limit in the framework of the dynamical dark energy model .",
    "one can see from the blue curve in figure [ fig3 ] that the degeneracy@xcite causes a much looser limit on the neutrino mass with @xmath78 ( @xmath10 c.l . ) .    , and the present matter density , @xmath15 , from the combined data , assuming a flat universe . the black solid lines are from data sets cmb @xmath67 lss @xmath67 sn ia and the red dashed lines are obtained by taking into account the weak lensing data .",
