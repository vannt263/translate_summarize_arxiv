    "the possible existence of the @xmath0 pentaquark remains one of the puzzling mysteries of recent years . to date",
    "there are more than 20 experiments with evidence for this state , but criticism for the @xmath0 claim arises because similar number of high energy experiments did not find any evidence for the @xmath0 , even though the `` conventional '' three - quark hyperons states , such as @xmath1 resonance , are seen clearly photoproduction off proton and deuteron with high statistics .",
    "meanwhile leps collaboration reported the new evidence of the @xmath0 in @xmath8 .",
    "also , star collaboration observed the doubly charged exotic baryon in the @xmath9 decay channel .",
    "for a recent review see @xcite . ] .",
    "the superposition of positive and negative results is very disturbing .",
    "new experiments are needed to confirm or refute pentaquark existence .",
    "most of negative high energy experiments are high statistic hadron beam experiments .",
    "_ e.g. _ hera - b , a fixed target experiment at the 920 gev proton storage ring of desy @xcite finds no evidence for narrow signals in the @xmath10 channel and only sets the upper limit on production @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross sections in mid - rapidity region",
    ". this negative result would present serious rebuttal evidence to worry about .",
    "however , without obvious production mechanism of the @xmath0 ( if it exists ) or even @xmath1 the rebuttal is not very convincing . as of today",
    ", the only positive high - energy hadron beam result is that by svd collaboration @xcite who finds a narrow @xmath11 resonance in the inclusive @xmath12 reaction using 70 gev proton beam at ihep accelerator .    in this paper",
    "we estimate the high - energy behavior of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production in inclusive @xmath2 processes in the fragmentation region using the @xmath3-exchange diagrams .",
    "our conclusion is that the cross section of the @xmath0-production is suppressed compared to the production of @xmath1 by a factor of @xmath13 .",
    "this suppression is mainly due to smallness of the coupling constant @xmath14 compared to @xmath15 that in turn is related to the small width of the @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath16-exchange diagram for @xmath17 is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : pp_inclusive ] . in the high energy limit the corresponding cross section written in terms of the feynman variable @xmath18",
    ", the fraction of incident proton momentum carried by the @xmath0 ( in the center - of - mass system ) , and @xmath19 , the transverse momentum of the @xmath0 relative to the initial proton momentum , reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is total center - of - mass energy squared , @xmath23 is the phenomenological form factor , @xmath24 is the 4-momentum transfer squared , and @xmath25 is the squared product of the vertex function for @xmath26 and kaon propagator : @xmath27 at high energy @xmath28 and the total cross section is energy independent .",
    "the cross section for the inclusive @xmath1 production has the similar form with the substitutions     production in inclusive pp scattering , width=151 ]    @xmath29      the @xmath30 vertex for @xmath31 is @xmath32 the lagrangian of eq .",

    "the partial decay width @xmath35 is @xmath36 where @xmath37 mev / c is the kaon momentum in the rest frame of @xmath0 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath38 can be expressed through the @xmath0 width as @xmath39      the @xmath40 vertex is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the vector spinor for the spin 3/2 particle .",

    "the @xmath45 width is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the kaon momentum in the rest frame of @xmath1 . using the pdg values of @xmath48 mev and @xmath49 we obtain @xmath50",

    "we take two representative examples for the form factor @xmath23 in ( [ dsigma ] ) : @xmath56with   @xmath57 .",
    "then we obtain for the production cross sections @xmath58 where the first values refer to the form factor ( a ) in ( [ formfactors ] ) and the second ones to the form factor ( b ) . the result for @xmath59 matches well that of ref .",
    "@xcite for the inclusive @xmath17 reaction at the threshold and intermediate energies .",
    "one can expect that the @xmath60 exchange yields the cross sections of the similar order of magnitude .",
    "our prediction for @xmath61 agrees with the preliminary result of the svd-2 collaboration @xcite , but @xmath59 is lower than the preliminary cross section estimation ( for @xmath62 ) of ref .",
