    "strongly interacting matter at non - zero temperature and chemical potential is an exciting topic for physicists coming from different areas , either theoretical or experimental .",
    "one of the main goals in the heavy - ion physics program nowadays is to study the effects of several macroscopic phenomena occurring under extreme conditions .",
    "the discussion about the existence of a tricritical point ( tcp ) or a critical end point ( cep ) is also a topic of recent interest .",
    "as is well known , a tcp separates the first order transition at high chemical potentials from the second order transition at high temperatures .",
    "if the second order transition is replaced by a smooth crossover , a cep which separates the two lines is found . at the cep",
    "the phase transition is of second order and probably falls into the same universality class of the three - dimensional ising model .",
    "the existence of the cep in qcd was suggested at the end of the eighties@xcite , and its properties in the context of several models have been studied since then@xcite .",
    "the most recent lattice results with @xmath0 staggered quarks of physical masses indicate the location of the cep at @xmath1 and @xmath2@xcite , however its exact location is not yet known .",
    "this point of the phase diagram is the special focus of the present contribution .",
    "nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) type models are used and the main goal is to locate the critical end point and confront the results with universality arguments .",
    "we remark that most of the work done in this area has been performed with non strange quarks only",
    ". we will discuss the class of the critical points by including the analyzes in the chiral limit of both su(2 ) and su(3 ) versions of the njl model .",

    ".    our model of strong interacting matter can simulate regions of a hot and dense fireball created in a heavy - ion collision .",
    "since electrons and positrons are not involved in the strong interaction , we impose the condition @xmath12 .",
    "so , we naturally get the chemical equilibrium condition @xmath13 that will be used .    after this presentation of the model",
    ", we discuss the phase diagrams in sec .",
    "the behavior of the baryon number susceptibility and the specific heat in the @xmath14 plane around the cep is studied in sec . 3 , as well as the corresponding critical exponents . finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "4 with a brief summary of our results .",
    "in this section we analyze the phase diagrams in different conditions in the @xmath14 plane . depending on the number of quark flavors @xmath15 or @xmath16 , and on the masses of the quarks , different situations can occur and the transition from hadronic matter to qgp may be of first order , second order , or a crossover transition .",
    "we start by analyzing the differences between the three - flavor njl model and its simpler version in the su(2 ) sector .",

    "concerning the su(2 ) model , and using physical values of the quark masses , @xmath18 mev , together with @xmath19 mev and @xmath20 , we find that the cep is localized at @xmath21 mev and @xmath22 mev .",
    "we verified that , in the chiral limit , the transition is of second order at @xmath23 and , as @xmath17 increases , the line of second order phase transition will end in a first order line at the tcp .",
    "the tcp is located at @xmath24 mev and @xmath25 mev .        for the su(3 ) njl model , also in the chiral limit ( @xmath26 ) , we verify that the phase diagram does not exhibit a tcp : chiral symmetry is restored via a first order transition for all baryonic chemical potentials and temperatures ( see right panel of fig .",

    "this pattern of chiral symmetry restoration remains for @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in our model",

    "the tcp for @xmath31 mev is located at @xmath32 mev and @xmath33 mev . if we choose @xmath34 , instead of second order transition we have a smooth crossover which critical line will end in the first order line at the cep . using the set of parameters@xcite : @xmath35 mev , @xmath36 mev , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 mev , this point is localized at @xmath40 mev and @xmath41 mev .",

    "as pointed out in@xcite , this change of the exponent can be interpreted as a crossover of different universality classes , with the cep being affected by the tcp .",
    "it seems that the effect of the hidden tcp on the cep is relevant for the specific heat contrarily to what happens to @xmath5 .     for different values of @xmath17 around @xmath68 in su(2 ) ( left panel ) and su(3 ) ( right panel ) njl models.__,title=\"fig : \" ]   for different values of @xmath17 around @xmath68 in su(2 ) ( left panel ) and su(3 ) ( right panel ) njl models.__,title=\"fig : \" ]    we also observe that there is no clear evidence of change of the slope of the fitting of data points in the three - flavor njl model ( see fig .",
