    "the authors showed that this model can be embedded in string theory , in a model independent manner , through the green - schwarz mechanism  @xcite . in the stringy embedding",
    "there was a huge enhancement of the lepton asymmetry due to a hierarchy in the fundamental string scale and the four dimensional planck scale .",
    "other investigators have searched for parity violation in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) which ultimately leads to a birefringence in gravitational waves  @xcite . in this note , we shall study the super - horizon power spectrum and tensor to scalar ratio of scalar and tensor birefringent perturbations produced during inflation . specifically , we study the spectrum of super - horizon gravity waves whose uv counterparts were responsible for leptogenesis .",
    "is it possible to see a signature of the leptogenesis mechanism in the super - horizon power spectrum ? to address this question we shall derive the tensor to scalar ratio and show that it contains a direct signature of the leptogenesis mechanism which occurred in the uv . furthermore we show that the scalar to tensor ratio contains the string scale in a model independent way and is in an observable window to this physics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we derive the equations for the gravitational waves in the presence of the chern - simons term . in section  iii we provide the exact solutions at various scales and",

    "iv we relate this modified tensor to scalar ratio to the stringy embedding of gravitational leptogenesis and we conclude with some open issues concerning a consistent quantization and further directions .",
    "the starting point of inflationary leptogenesis is the einstein - hilbert action coupled to the gravitational chern - simons term , which is necessarily present in string theory .",

    "as discussed in the preceding subsection , we will fix the initial conditions in the region @xmath149 which is free of divergences . in this regime ,",
    "the only natural choice that we have is to postulate a plane wave .",
    "this is equivalent to postulating that the non - linear phenomena occurring around the divergence of the effective potential , provided they happen in the trans - planckian region , will not affect the standard choice of the initial conditions in the region @xmath150 .",

    "let us stress , however , that a possible weakness of the above comparison is that , in the case of the trans - planckian problem of inflation  @xcite , one can show that the final result can be robust to changes in the short distance physics  @xcite ( under some conditions , _",
    "i.e.  _ adiabatic evolution of the fourier modes ) . in the present context",
    ", however , it is more difficult to imagine that the non - linearities will not affect the initial conditions . on the other hand , in the absence of a second - order calculations and as a first approach to the problem , this seems to be quite reasonable . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , see eqs .",

    "@xcite , @xmath152 .",
    "the sign of the argument in the exponential depends on the polarization state considered , as expected .",
    "we conclude that the solution to the mode equation on very large scales is now known explicitly .",
    "usually , the power spectrum is given by the two - point correlation function calculated in the vacuum state .",
    "another way to calculate the same quantity is to view it as a classical spatial average .",

    "the above expression is similar to eq .",
    "( 15 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite . at this stage",
    ", the only thing which remains to be done is to expand the above expression at first order in the slow - roll parameter .",
    "after lengthy but straightforward calculations , one obtains the following result    @xmath163 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with , @xmath164 at this point some remarks are in order .",
    "as required one can check that , when @xmath165 , the standard inflationary result is recovered .",
    "this is the case because @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "as already mentioned , a factor @xmath168 is left because the ( now identical ) contribution from the two states of polarization should be added .",
    "the function @xmath169 describes the dominant modification in the amplitude of the power spectrum ( the contribution originating from the function @xmath170 is clearly sub - dominant since it is proportional to the slow - roll parameter @xmath171 ) . for small values of @xmath85",
    "we have @xmath172 where @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "therefore , the amplitude of the right polarization state is reduced while the one of the left polarization state is enhanced . however , for small values of @xmath85 , the effect is clearly not very important .",
    "another conclusion that can be obtained from the above spectrum is that , at leading order in the slow roll parameter , the spectral index remains unmodified .",

    "one gets @xmath178 it is clear from this expression that the modification is not observable at all since we have seen before that , typically , @xmath179 in order for the calculations presented here to be consistent ( _ i.e .",
    "_ for the divergence of the effective potential to be in the trans - planckian region ) .",
    "we have evaluated the super - hubble power spectrum and the tensor to scalar ratio for birefringent gravitational waves produced during inflation .",
    "the power spectrum exhibits two interesting regimes , linear and non - linear .",
    "the non - linear regime occurs when @xmath180 because the effective potential controlling the evolution of the linear perturbations blows up . at this point ,",
    "the linear theory of cosmological perturbations that we used is no longer valid .",
    "this divergence occurs for all modes ( _ i.e .",
    "_ for all comoving wavenumber @xmath82 ) but at different times .    in this present investigation we only considered the linear regime since at the present moment we were not able to perform a rigorous analysis of the non - linear phenonema",
    "we found corrections which survive to second order in @xmath181 .",
    "therefore , in this regime the tensor to scalar ratio gets corrected by @xmath181 but this effect is very small .",
    "if @xmath135 , one can push the non - linear regime ( _ i.e .  _",
    "the divergence in the effective potential ) into the trans - planckian region where , anyway , other effects ( for instance , non perturbative stringy effects ) are likely to become important . somehow , this corresponds to the standard situation where the evolution from the planck scale to the super - horizon scales is under control and where the perturbations are assumed to emerge from the trans - planckian regime in the vacuum state , thus ignoring the modifications of the initial conditions that the trans - planckian physics could cause ( in the very same way that we have ignored the effect of the divergence in the potential , provided it is in the trans - planckian region ) .",
    "however , it is important to keep in mind that this is mostly a technical trick which allows us to work with the linear theory . at a deeper level",
    ", the trans - planckian effects are not expected to play a more important role than in the standard situation . in particular ,",
    "if the divergence is not in the trans - planckian regime , only the non - linear theory of cosmological perturbations is necessary in order to calculate the modified @xmath0 irrespectively of any trans - planckian effects .",
    "it is interesting to note that the linear regime ( where @xmath182 ) is compatible with the stringy embedding of inflationary baryogenesis ( seb )  @xcite . in this context",
    ", the value of @xmath181 enhances and gives the resonant frequency associated with the observed baryon asymmetry .",
    "as already mentioned before , this value is completely fixed by the string scale and coupling in a model independent fashion .",
    "explicitly , the value of the number @xmath2 which appears in the definition of @xmath85 , see eq .",
    "( [ deftheta ] ) , is given by @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the ten - dimensional fundamental scale and @xmath185 is the string coupling .",
    "therefore , we established a direct link between stringy quantities and cmb anisotropies .",
    "explicitly , eq .  ( [ cccheck ] ) can be re - written as @xmath186 in a recent paper the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found that for reasonable values of string coupling ( _ i.e .  _",
    "weak ) and the string scale set to @xmath187 , both @xmath85 can be as small as @xmath188 and the observed baryon asymmetry can be generated .",
    "of course the stringy embedding admits much larger values of @xmath181 putting our analysis into the non - linear regime .    if @xmath189 , a non - linear calculation is mandatory and one can hope to obtain a significative modification of the ratio @xmath0 , maybe observable by future high accuracy cmb experiments .",
    "clearly , the present situation is not very satisfactory since the regime for which sizable effects are expected turns out to be very complicated from the technical point of view .",
    "furthermore , we suspect that the scale associated to the divergence of the effective potential corresponds to a resonant production of lepton number .",

    "<S> in this work we show that the gravitational chern - simons term , aside from being a key ingredient in inflationary baryogenesis , modifies super - horizon gravitational waves produced during inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the super - hubble gravitational power spectrum in the slow - roll approximation and show that its overall amplitude is modified while its spectral index remains unchanged ( at leading order in the slow - roll parameters ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , we calculate the correction to the tensor to scalar ratio , @xmath0 . we find a correction of @xmath0 which is dependent on @xmath1 ( more precisely quadratic in @xmath2 ) , the parameter characterizing the amplitude of the chern - simons terms . in a stringy embedding of the leptogenesis mechanism , @xmath1 is the ratio between the planck scale and the fundamental string scale . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in principle , we provide a direct probe of leptogenesis due to stringy dynamics in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , we demonstrate that the corresponding correction of @xmath0 is in fact very small and not observable in the regime where our calculations are valid . to obtain a sizable effect </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that a non - linear calculation is necessary . </S>"
