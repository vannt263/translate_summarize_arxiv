    "sometime back @xcite , we reported results of the longitudinal structure function @xmath2 at small _ x _ using a self - similarity based model of quark and gluon distributions @xcite .",
    "the model was alternative to the model of proton suggested by lastovicka @xcite .",
    "we did not pursue the model of ref.@xcite in @xcite due to the presence of a singularity at @xmath3 ( which lies outside its range of validity ) although the longitudinal structure function involves an integration upto @xmath4 .",
    "the limitation of the model of ref.@xcite is that it did not specify the range of its validity unlike ref.@xcite and hence qualitatively less reliable . in ref.@xcite",
    ", we therefore assumed its validity in the entire _ x _ range to estimate the longitudinal structure function .",
    "+ in the present work , we use the model of ref.@xcite instead .",
    "we invoke momentum sum rule @xcite in the range @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , compute the momentum fraction of quarks and gluons and pin down the gluon distribution numerically .",
    "we then use it to compute the bound on the longitudinal structure function @xmath2 for altarelli - martinelli equation in qcd @xcite and compare it using recent data @xcite .",
    "2 we outline the formalism , and sec . 3 gives the results and discussion .",
    "the conclusions of this work are highlighted in sec .",
    "in ref.@xcite , the following form of parton density function ( pdf ) and the structure function @xmath8 were suggested based on the notion of self - similarity , @xmath9 @xmath10 valid in the range @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the mass scale @xmath11 was set to be 1 @xmath12 .",
    "here , @xmath13 .",
    "the parameters are @xcite @xmath14 the formalism of momentum sum rule @xcite has been reported recently in ref.@xcite .",
    "we briefly outline here for completeness .",
    "+ the momentum sum rule inequality yields @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 with @xmath17 . the parameter _ a _ is _ x _ independent .",
    "its value has been determined from data in our earlier paper @xcite and is found to be approximately equal to 3.1418 ( for fractional charged quarks ) . for integral charged partons , _ a _ = 1 @xcite .",
    "we define the total @xmath18 and the partial @xmath19 momentum fractions of quarks and gluons respectively as @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "we have seen that one can evaluate @xmath21 for any @xmath24 , which is given by the relation @xcite : @xmath25 using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : q2 ] ) , we calculate the numerical values of @xmath21 for a few representative values of @xmath24 and subsequently obtain the maximum limit of @xmath26 .",
    "we then tabulate them in table [ tab : hq2 ] .",
    "we observe that as @xmath24 increases , @xmath21 also increases but @xmath26 decreases .",
    "we also note that the partial momentum fractions of quarks ( @xmath21 ) and gluons ( @xmath26 ) vary with @xmath24 and thus can be related as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is any @xmath24 dependent function and it decreases with @xmath24 in the gev scale ( table [ tab : hq2 ] ) .",
    ".**values of @xmath21 , @xmath26 and @xmath28 for given values of @xmath24 . * * [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the above analysis indicates that a generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : jks ] ) @xcite is necessary to be compatible with both momentum analyses of ref.@xcite as well as the theoretical expectation of ref.@xcite .",
    "thus , evaluating the value of @xmath8 ( eq .",
    "( [ eqn : f2 ] ) ) and using the corresponding values of @xmath29 from table [ tab : hq2 ] , we obtain the values of @xmath30 for different sets of _ x _ and @xmath24 .",
    "its qualitative feature can be studied from figure [ fig : g1 ] and figure [ fig : g2 ] . while in figure",
    "[ fig : g1 ] , we plot @xmath30 vs _ x _ for a few representative values of @xmath24 = 10 , 30 and 60 @xmath12 , figure [ fig : g2 ] gives the plot for @xmath30 vs @xmath31 for _ x _",
    "= @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in both the cases , the dashed curves and",
    "the solid curves denote graphs for @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "+ in figure [ fig : fl ] , we plot the predicted lower bound on @xmath37 both for @xmath38 ( integral charged partons ) and @xmath39 ( fractional charged partons ) . in the same plot , we also show the available experimental data on @xmath37 .",
    "the data are invariably above the predicted theoretical lower limit as expected .     shown as a function of @xmath31 at the given values of @xmath40 .",

    "in the present work , we have pinned down the gluon distribution function from a self - similarity based model of proton structure function at small _ x _ using momentum sum rule .",
    "we then computed the longitudinal structure function @xmath41 valid in the same kinematical region as that of the parent model @xcite .",
    "this results in only partial information of the longitudinal structure function in the form of a lower bound . compared to our previous analysis @xcite on the same , the present one is more reliable since the kinematical region of validity is well - defined .",
    "moreover , we also avoided the problem of singularity of the model at @xmath42 which lies outside its phenomenological range of validity .",
    "it will be interesting to see the effects of the higher order terms of the expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : series ] ) in the present analysis",
    ". + the applicability of the method is , however , not limited only to a self - similarity based model .",
    "rather , it can be used in any dglap based models as well @xcite if their range of validity in a specific kinematic range of _ x _ is well - determined phenomenologically .",
