    "since this line is self - conjugate , its intersection with @xmath3 will be a line in @xmath2 .",
    "the problem of classifying real cubic curves was studied already by isaac newton ( but in the affine plane ; see @xcite and compare @xcite ) . in general , the projective classification of real curves is parallel to the complex classification , however there are important differences . in looking at pictures of real cubic curves ,",
    "it is important to remember that the real projective plane is a non - orientable manifold , and that every real cubic curve has a non - orientable neighborhood , which can never be completely pictured within an affine plane ( remark [ r - top ] ) .      since the full complex curve @xmath0 is smooth , it has nine flex points .",

    "two simple closed curves with transverse intersections have an odd number of intersections if and only if both curves are essential .",

    "the picture becomes much clearer if we choose a spherical metric for the projective plane which is invariant under these automorphisms , as in figure [ f - sym ] .",

    "for example , each of the three involutions can be described either as a @xmath618 rotation about one of the flex points ( which lifts to an orientation preserving rotation of the covering 2-sphere ) , or as a reflection about the line of symmetry (= great circle ) which passes through the north - south pole , and crosses the equator halfway between the other two flex points . with the second description",
    ", it evidently lifts to an orientation reversing reflection of the 2-sphere .",
    "[ r - can ] every real cubic curve can also be represented by a canonical picture in the affine plane which makes its six symmetries evident .",

    "then we will have a uniquely determined picture for each @xmath9 .",
    "some typical examples are shown in figure [ f - canpics ] .",

    "the limit as @xmath653 is a smooth curve plus an isolated point at the origin , while the limit as @xmath654 is a union of three lines .",
