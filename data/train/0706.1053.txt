    "although observations of cosmic epochs closer to the present have indisputably shown that the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is in an ionized state , it is yet unclear when the phase transition from the neutral state to the ionized one started .",
    "thus , the redshift of reionization , @xmath14 , is still very uncertain .",
    "after the first year wmap data a possible tension was identified between cmb and sdss results . the high electron - scattering optical depth inferred from the te - ee power spectra @xmath15 (; ) seemed difficult to be reconciled with the strong evolution in the gunn - peterson optical depth @xmath16 at @xmath17 (; ) , accompanied by the appearance of large dark portions in qso absorption spectra (; ; , hereafter f06 ) .",
    "the 3-yr wmap results have released the above tension by providing a smaller value for @xmath18 , which implies @xmath19 for a model with instantaneous reionization (; ) .",
    "however , an increasing number of laes are routinely found at @xmath20 ( e.g. ; ; ) , possibly requiring a substantial free electron fraction , resulting in an igm relatively transparent to ly@xmath3 photons .",
    "constraints on the igm ionization state derived by using ly@xmath3 forest spectroscopy must take into account the extremely high sensitivity of @xmath16 to tiny neutral hydrogen amounts .",
    "indeed , a volume averaged neutral hydrogen fraction as low as @xmath21 @xcite is sufficient to completely depress the transmitted flux in qso absorption spectra ; thus , the detection of a gunn - peterson trough only translates into a lower limit for @xmath22 . for this reason ,",
    "recently , many studies have tried to clarify if the sdss data effectively require that the igm was reionized as late as @xmath2 ( , hereafter gcf06 ; ): in particular , gcf06 have shown that qso observational data currently available are compatible with a highly ionized universe at that redshift .",
    "clearly the determination of the reionization epoch is strictly related to the measurement of the neutral hydrogen fraction at @xmath2 . to investigate this issue",
    "many different approaches can be used . to start with",
    ", it is worth mentioning that many authors have tried to constrain @xmath22 at high redshift by analyzing statistically the optical depth inside hii regions around high redshift qso (; ) , or by measuring the qso bubble sizes (; ; ; , ) .",
    "however , sufficient ground for controversy remains due to intrinsic uncertainties of the various techniques .    by deriving sizes of hii bubbles surrounding observed @xmath23 laes ,",
    "have provided an upper limit for the neutral hydrogen fraction @xmath24 .",
    "this result is in quite good agreement with the upper limit @xmath25 found by , by interpreting the deficit measured at the bright end of the lae luminosity function at @xmath26 as a sudden change in the intergalactic neutral hydrogen content .",
    "nevertheless , the increasing attenuation with redshift of the ly@xmath3 line transmission could be partially explained as a consequence of the evolution in the mass function of dark matter halos , thus implying a much lower upper limit , @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "grb spectroscopy has also tentatively used to constrain @xmath22 ; have observed a damping wing at wavelengths larger than the ly@xmath3 emission line , finding that this feature can be explained at best by assuming an intervening damped ly@xmath3 system immersed in a fully ionized igm , and quoting an upper limit of @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 confidence levels , respectively ) .",
    "finally , the width distribution of dark portions ( gaps ) seen in qso absorption spectra has been recently introduced in order to constrain the igm ionization state (; f06 ; gcf06 ) .",
    "f06 has used the dark gap distribution , as observed in 19 high-@xmath32 qso spectra , to put a preliminary upper limit on the igm neutral fraction @xmath33 .",
    "gcf06 , by analyzing the statistically properties of the transmitted flux in simulated absorption spectra , have shown that the gap and peak ( i.e. transmission windows ) width statistics are very promising tools for discriminating between an early ( @xmath34 ) and a late ( @xmath35 ) reionization scenario . here",
    "we combine the previous two results : by comparing the observed transmitted flux in high-@xmath32 qso spectra with theoretical predictions we obtain tighter constraints on the neutral hydrogen fraction around @xmath17 , a crucial epoch in the reionization history .    the plan of the paper is the following : in section 2 we describe the semi - analytical modeling adopted ; in section 3 we compare observational data with simulations .",
    "the implications of this comparison are given in section 4 ; in section 5 we evaluate the robustness of our method against the specific line of sight to the highest redshift qso .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section 6 .",
    "the radiation emitted by qsos could be absorbed through ly@xmath3 transition by the neutral hydrogen intersecting the line of sight , the so - called gunn - peterson ( gp ) effect .",
    "the ly@xmath3 forest arises from absorption by low amplitude - fluctuations in the underlying baryonic density field @xcite , and is a natural consequence of the hierarchical structure formation expected in the context of cdm cosmologies , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , respectively , and a hubble constant of @xmath38  km  s@xmath39mpc@xmath39 , with @xmath40 .",

    "to simulate the gp optical depth ( @xmath16 ) distribution we use the method described by gcf06 , whose main features are recalled in the following .",
    "the spatial distribution of the baryonic density field and its correlation with the peculiar velocity field are taken into account adopting the formalism introduced by . to enter the mildly non - linear regime which characterizes the ly@xmath3 forest absorbers we use a log - normal model introduced by ,",
    "widely adopted later on (; ; ; ; ; gcf06 ) . in particular , gcf06 have compared various ly@xmath3 statistics , namely the probability distribution function ( pdf ) and the gap width distribution , computed using the log - normal distribution with those obtained from hydropm simulations , finding a good agreement between the results . for a given igm temperature ,",
    "the hi fraction , @xmath22 , can be computed from the photoionization equilibrium as a function of the baryonic density field and photoionization rate due to the ultraviolet background radiation field .",
    "for all these quantities we follow the approach of , hereafter cf06 . by assuming as ionizing sources qsos , popii and popiii stars ( the latter neglected here , see below ) ,",
    "their model provides excellent fits to a large number of observational data , namely the redshift evolution of lyman - limit systems , ly@xmath3 and ly@xmath48 optical depths , electron scattering optical depth , cosmic star formation history , and the number counts of high redshift sources .",

    "we compare the volume - averaged photoionization rate @xmath61 for the two models with the recent estimate by f06 , and the ones by , , and , hereafter mm01 , b05 and b07 , respectively .",
    "finally , the evolution of the volume - averaged neutral hydrogen fraction for the erm and lrm is presented in the rightmost panel .",
    "the photoionization rate predicted by both models is in agreement with the results by b05 and b07 at in the range @xmath62 , whereas at @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) the erm is characterized by a photoionization rate which is @xmath65 2 ( 6 ) times larger than the estimates by f06 . in spite of these differences , our predictions for @xmath22 are consistent with f06 measurements .",
    "this apparent contradiction does not come as a surprise .",
    "in fact , the derivation of @xmath61 requires an assumption concerning the igm density distribution . when measuring @xmath61 at @xmath66 , f06 assume the density probability distribution function given by , hereafter mhr to match the mm01 measurement at @xmath67 .",
    "this estimate is based on a mean transmitted flux ( @xmath68 ) which is lower than the more recent measurements @xmath69 by , which implies @xmath70 . ] .",
    "we instead adopt a log - normal ( ln ) model which predicts a higher probability to find overdensities @xmath71 than mhr .",
    "for example , at @xmath17 and for @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "for this reason , once @xmath16 is fixed to the observed value , the ln model requires a higher @xmath61 . as @xmath74 ,",
    "these two effects combine to give a values of @xmath22 consistent with the data .",
    "we first test the predictions of our model by applying various statistical analysis to the simulated spectra and comparing our results with observations . specifically , we use the following control statistics : ( i ) mean transmitted flux evolution in the redshift range @xmath75 ; ( ii ) probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the transmitted flux at the mean redshifts @xmath76 ; ( iii ) gap width ( gw ) distribution in @xmath77 . for what concerns",

    "the comparison of model and observational results in terms of the above three statistics is plotted in fig .",
    "[ controlfig ] . by checking our models",
    "we follow the same approach of gcf06 , to which we refer for a complete description of the technical details .",
    "the outcome of the test is encouraging , as both erm and lrm successfully match the observational data at @xmath81 for the control statistics considered .",
    "this allows us to confidently proceed the comparison with more advanced statistical tools .      since at @xmath2 regions with high transmission in the ly@xmath3",
    "forest become rare , an appropriate method to analyze the statistical properties of the transmitted flux is the distribution of gaps .",
    "in particular gcf06 suggested that the largest gap width ( lgw ) and the largest peak width ( lpw ) statistics are suitable tools to study the ionization state of the igm at high redshift intervals greater than the observed pixel size ( @xmath82  ) characterized by a transmission above a given flux threshold ( @xmath83 in this work ) . ] .",
    "the lgw ( lpw ) distribution quantifies the fraction of los which are characterized by the largest gap ( peak ) of a given width .",

    "we choose different intervals , namely 1050 - 1183 and 1050 - 1140 , respectively .",
    "these two objects have been classified as bal qso (; ; ) , since their spectra present broad absorption lines associated with highly ionized atomic species ( e.g. siiv , civ ) . by selecting the above intervals we exclude those portions of the spectra characterized by civ absorption features which extend to @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) in sdss j1044 - 0125 ( sdss j1048 + 4637 ) .",

    "the results provided by the statistics adopted in this study are sensitive to the s / n ratio , since spurious peaks could arise in spectral regions with noise higher than the @xmath97 adopted .",
    "indeed , the shape of the lgw / lpw distributions depends on the @xmath97 chosen .",
    "thus , we consider two different values for @xmath97 , namely @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively , and , for both of them , compute preliminary lgw / lpw distributions . finally , the lgw / lpw distributions presented are obtained as the mean of the preliminary ones , weighted on the corresponding errors ( see appendix a for a detailed discussion ) . in our analysis",
    "we do not consider 2 qsos presented by f06 , namely sdss j1436 + 5007 and sdss j1630 + 4012 , since these spectra have significantly lower s / n to apply lgw / lpw tests ( continuum s / n @xmath100 ) .",

    ", we have shown that lrm models can be used to put a robust upper limit @xmath282 at @xmath9 .",
    "+ we have suggested that peaks preferentially arise from underdense regions of the cosmic density field and also from isolated hii regions produced by either faint quasars or galaxies .",
    "the frequency of the observed peaks implies that the dark matter halos hosting such sources is relatively large , @xmath283 ( @xmath167 ) @xmath284 .",
    "bright qsos are unlikely to contribute significantly in terms of peaks , because given the required size of the hii regions , they should be located close enough to the los to the target qso , that they should be detectable in the field .",
    "the previous conclusions are substantiated by the specific case of an intervening hii region produced by the faint quasar rd j1148 + 5253 ( qso1 ) at @xmath10 along the los toward the highest redshift quasar currently known ( sdss j1148 + 5251 , qso2 ) at @xmath11 .",
    "it is worth noting that searches for the transverse proximity effect in the hi ly@xmath3 forest at @xmath285 @xcite have been so far unsuccessful .",
    "such effect has been isolated only by heii absorption studies ( ;) .",
    "thus , our results represent the first - ever detection in the hi ly@xmath3 forest .",
    "we have analyzed the proximity effect of qso1 on the qso2 spectrum .",
    "moreover , we have build up a simple model to estimate the location / extension of the proximity zone . within the proximity region of qso1",
    "we have found an increased number of peaks per unit frequency with respect to segments of the los located outside the quasar hii bubble .",
    "this supports the idea that we are indeed sampling the proximity region of the qso1 and that at least some peaks originate within ionized regions around ( faint ) sources .",
    "we then obtain a strong lower limit on the foreground qso lifetime of @xmath12 myr",
    ". proper inclusion of galaxy clustering , which requires numerical simulations , might affect our conclusions @xcite .",
    "note that even in this clear - cut case , the size of the largest observed peak in the spectrum of qso2 is only of 2 .",
    "thus we are left with the puzzling discrepancy between observed and simulated transmissivity windows ( peaks ) size , the former being systematically larger .",
    "very likely , this reflects an unwarranted assumption made by the model .",
    "we do not believe that the discrepancy could be impute to the assumption of a log - normal model , tested against hydropm simulations by gcf06 .",
    "nevertheless , we plan to compare the observed largest peak width distribution with full hydrodynamical simulations in a future work to study the correlation properties of the underdense regions , since coles et al .",
    "( 1993 ) have shown that the log - normal model produces a too `` clumpy '' distribution of the density field , when compared with n - body simulations .",
    "at least two physical effects , neglected here , could affect the calculation of @xmath22 : ( i ) non - equilibrium photoionization , and ( ii ) uv background radiation fluctuations .",
    "+ the first assumption is made by the majority of studies dealing with the ly@xmath3 forest .",
    "however , if a fraction of the ly@xmath3 forest gas has been shock - heated as it condenses into the cosmic web filaments , it might cool faster than it recombines . for example , the recombination time @xmath286 becomes longer than the hubble time when the density contrast is @xmath287^{-3/2}$ ] ; hence , large deviations from photoionization equilibrium are expected where @xmath288 .",
    "lower values of @xmath22 with respect to equilibrium are expected in such regions , as a result of the exceedingly slow recombination rates .",
    "+ the second possible explanation for the too narrow simulated peaks might reside in radiative transfer effects , also neglected here . at @xmath289",
    "the increase in the mean gp optical depth is accompanied by an evident enhancement of the dispersion of this measurement which has been ascribed to spatial fluctuations of the uvb intensity near the end of reionization .",
    "a considerable ( up to 10% ) scatter in the uvb hi photoionization rate is expected already at @xmath290 , as shown by through detailed radiative transfer calculations .",
    "the amplitude of such illumination fluctuations tend to increase with redshift because of the overall thickening of the forest .",
    "although the observed dispersion in the mean gp optical depth may be compatible with a spatially uniform uvb (; ) , it is likely that a proper radiative transfer treatment becomes mandatory at earlier times .",
    "basically , the main effect of fluctuations is to break the dependence of the hi neutral fraction on density .",
    "this is readily understood by considering two perturbations with the same density contrast @xmath291 .",
    "if the first is close to a luminous source it will have its @xmath22 depressed well below that of the second one located away from it .",
    "thus , opacity fluctuations naturally arise .",
    "if so , peaks of larger width could be produced if the density perturbation associated with it happens to be located in a region where the uvb intensity is higher than the mean .",

    "the gap / peak statistics are sensitive to the s / n ratio , since spurious peaks could arise in spectral regions with noise higher than the flux threshold ( @xmath97 ) adopted . in what follows we restrict our attention to `` gaps '' , since the extension of the conclusions on the `` peaks '' is direct .",

    ", the spectrum of qso j1030 + 0524 is shown , and , in the small box , the region marked by the solid black line is zoomed .",
    "it is evident that @xmath294 would break the gap at @xmath295  , instead of at @xmath296 , as also noticed by f06 ; thus , in this case @xmath83 seems to be a better choice .",
