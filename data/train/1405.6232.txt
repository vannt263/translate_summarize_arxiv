    "recent experimental evidence from a variety of living neural networks suggests that the brain may be operating at or near a critical point , poised between disordered ( `` subcritical '' ) and ordered ( `` supercritical '' ) phases where cascades of activity are damped or amplified , respectively @xcite . at this interface , neural networks",
    "are expected to produce avalanches of activity whose size and duration probability distributions follow power laws , as a distinctive feature of critical phenomena is scale - invariance @xcite . theory and simulations conjectured that neural networks poised at a critical point would have optimal information transmission @xcite , information storage @xcite , computational power @xcite , dynamic range @xcite , and learning capabilities @xcite , while providing flexible , yet stable dynamics @xcite . several experiments claim results consistent with these predictions @xcite , lending plausibility to the criticality hypothesis of brain function @xcite .    here",
    "we introduce and analyze the so - called _ cortical branching model _ ( cbm ) , a non - equilibrium stochastic cellular automaton capturing many features of neural network data @xcite , and develop an analytical mean - field approximation in the form of an autonomous nonlinear discrete dynamical map of first order and dimension given by the integer - valued refractory period .",
    "we establish the non - equilibrium phase diagram of the cbm and identify three separate phases : the disordered , the ordered , and the quasiperiodic phases . using this mean - field approximation",
    ", we argue that a continuous phase transition between the disordered and ordered phases occurs ( in the thermodynamic limit ) only when external driving , which we model as the spontaneous activation of network elements , is absent .    in our cbm , when external driving is present ( a key feature of open dynamical systems ) , we find that this phase transition disappears and hence argue that true criticality is not attainable by living neural networks .",
    "we thus introduce an extension , along with a more proper quantitative formulation of the _ quasi_-criticality hypothesis .",
    "our quasi - criticality hypothesis involves a non - equilibrium widom line of maximum ( though finite ) dynamical susceptibility along which correlation length and , as we shall demonstrate , mutual information are maximized .",
    "we expect that quasi - critical behavior can be observed along this line : for instance , distributions of activity avalanches are nearly power - law and avalanche shape collapses can be approximately performed to yield approximate scaling exponents @xcite .",
    "moreover , this widom line framework quantifies the notion of proximity of our neural system to its unattainable non - equilibrium critical point , i.e. we now know how to drive the system towards or away from its optimal behavior , by manipulating the relevant parameters .    additionally , increasing the refractory period at large values of the branching parameter , induces a quasiperiodic phase in the mean - field which corresponds to synchronous activation in simulations .",
    "results of our numerical simulations are qualitatively consistent with the mean - field calculations as long as the graph underlying the complex network is irreducible . because spontaneous activation rates in neural networks are readily manipulated experimentally @xcite , our predictions could soon be tested ; it is worth noting that our approach can be extended to other systems , such as the sirs compartmental disease epidemic model , which shares many similarities with the cbm @xcite , although the latter is more general . in our concluding remarks ,",
    "we describe how to experimentally control various parameters involved in the cbm to assess the validity of the quasi - criticality hypothesis .",
    "we next introduce details of the cbm .",
    "consider a random directed network , or graph , of @xmath0 nodes , where each node has its own local neighborhood of interactions ; connections are established and kept fixed throughout the dynamics , as in quenched disorder .",
    "random networks can either be _ strongly - connected_in which case there exists a path ( never running anti - parallel through directed connections ) from any node in the network to any other node on the network ( through possibly many intermediaries)or _ weakly - connected_in which case the network contains disjoint subgraphs and is said to not be fully - connected .",
    "networks are generated randomly and tested for connectedness by examining the corresponding adjacency matrix associated with its graph . in this study",
    ", we only consider strongly - connected networks , i.e. those with _",
    "irreducible _ adjacency matrices @xcite .",

    "internodal connections are weighted , with elements of the weighted adjacency matrix @xmath1 representing the probability @xmath2 that a connection from node @xmath3 to node @xmath4 will transmit activity , with @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the branching parameter ( which is equivalent to the perron - frobenius eigenvalue of @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 is the in - degree of each node , @xmath9 is the connection strength bias , and @xmath10 ranks each connection inbound at node @xmath4 by strength , e.g. @xmath11 corresponds to the strongest connection inbound at node @xmath4 .",

    "it had previously been determined that for a network of @xmath17 nodes , each with a fixed @xmath18 , that the values @xmath19 and @xmath20 allowed for a reasonable fit to the local field potential ( lfp ) dynamics recorded from living neural networks @xcite ; we present our primary simulation results with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",

    "we define the configuration space of the cbm as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 ; for example , @xmath39 for a system of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "a node @xmath3 is said to be _ active _ when @xmath42 , _ inactive _",
    "( i.e. quiescent ) when @xmath29 , and _ refractory _ at any other value .",
    "nodes can only be active for a single time step at a time .",
    "the system is driven by the spontaneous activation of a node , which occurs with probability @xmath43 .",
    "the number of time steps between spontaneous activations follows a discrete probability distribution of our choice : a poisson distribution with rate @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45 , allows for a greater separation of driving and relaxation timescales , such as that seen in instances of self - organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite , thus minimizing the occurrence of overlapping avalanches ; whereas by using a geometric distribution with success probability @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath47 , avalanches are more likely to overlap and contain spontaneous events .",
    "simulation results presented herein utilize poisson - distributed spontaneous events to generate avalanches .",
    "a node can also be driven to activate by another node connected to it with probabilities given by eq .",
    ", but only if the driving node was active and the driven node quiescent in the preceding time step .",
    "regardless of the method of stochastic activation , a node s dynamical variable @xmath48 changes deterministically following activation , increasing by @xmath27 every time step until @xmath49 is reached , after which the node becomes quiescent ( @xmath29 ) until it is stochastically activated once again .",
    "thus , each state variable @xmath48 represents a _ clock _ degree of freedom . for example , consider a node @xmath3 with @xmath50 : following the time step during which it was active , this node will become refractory , its state deterministically changing from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , and finally to @xmath29 .",

    "spatio - temporal clusters of activation ( avalanches ) exhibited by the cbm mimic spatio - temporal patterns ( _ neuronal _ avalanches ) observed in living neural networks @xcite .",
    "we explore their properties by first defining the density of active nodes at time @xmath16 , @xmath67 , as @xmath68 although we often consider its time average , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the total number of time steps .",

    "@xmath71 will be determined from the expression @xmath73 .",
    "periods of inactivity ( @xmath74 ) are punctuated by periods of activity ( @xmath75 ) which constitute avalanches .",
    "the properties of these avalanches are encoded in the avalanche _ shape _ , which we define as the density of active nodes over the duration of an avalanche , resembling definitions given in previous studies @xcite .",
    "the avalanche shape vector @xmath76 gives the shape of the @xmath77th avalanche : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is its starting time , @xmath80 is its duration , and @xmath81 \\in \\mathbb{z}^+$ ] indexes the number of time steps within the avalanche . from this , we write the size of the @xmath77th avalanche as @xmath82 .",

    "in order to gain a deeper understanding of our cbm and its non - equilibrium phase diagram , we next develop an analytical mean - field approximation . in the mean - field approximation , a typical , _ representative _ node and its local neighborhood of interaction ( i.e. the @xmath8 sites which directly influence its behavior ) are used to approximate the behavior of the network as a whole  the key presumption here being that transition probabilities are translationally invariant in the thermodynamic limit and beyond the upper critical dimension .",
    "we would expect the mean - field approach to represent a faithful approximation of the simulation results when the simulated graph is irreducible ; it is an extremely interesting question to explore the cases where the graph is reducible , but this is beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "the cellular automaton rules of the cbm ( described above in section [ sec : thecbm ] ) are approximated by a markovian stochastic process and so the probability that a particular node will be in a specific state is given by the chapman - kolmogorov equation @xcite : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is an element in the state space @xmath91 , @xmath92 identifies the nodes ( with @xmath93 corresponding to the representative node ) , @xmath94 is the configuration of the system ( i.e. a vector whose elements are the states of the representative node and its local neighborhood of interaction ) , and @xmath95 is the probability that the @xmath93 node will transition into state @xmath90 given the system configuration @xmath96 . at a particular iteration of the mean - field , @xmath16 ,",
    "the probability that a node @xmath97 is in state @xmath90 is equivalent to the fraction of nodes @xmath98 in state @xmath90 : @xmath99 . additionally , because we are primarily interested in the density of active nodes @xmath100 and because a node must be quiescent at @xmath16 to become active at @xmath63 , we rewrite eq . as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the configuration of the local neighborhood _ excluding _ the representative node , i.e. @xmath103 .",

    "at any iteration @xmath16 , @xmath110 , we reduce the dimension to @xmath111 . this map then allows us to calculate the mean - field densities of quiescent ( @xmath112 ) , active ( @xmath113 ) , and refractory nodes .",
    "an equivalent mean - field approximation can be formulated as a non - markovian @xmath111th - order map in one dimension .",
    "finally , we note that increasing the refractory period by a single time step increases the number of equations by one ; whereas increasing @xmath8 increases the order of polynomial to be solved .",
    "fixed points @xmath114 of this map give approximate densities of active sites , i.e. mean - field approximations to eq . .",
    "stability of each fixed point is determined as usual by calculating the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix associated with the map ; if each of the eigenvalues of the jacobian when evaluated at a certain fixed point have modulus less than one , then that fixed point is stable .",
