    "+ [ toc ]    singlet fission ( sf ) in organic materials , the process by which an optically excited spin@xmath0singlet intramolecular state s * dissociates into two lower - energy spin triplet excitons t , has been the focus of extensive investigation over the past few years .",
    "@xcite provided specific energetic considerations are met in an organic donor@xmath0acceptor heterostructure , @xcite each long - lived triplet exciton generated through sf in the donor molecule can in principle undergo charge dissociation at the donor@xmath0acceptor interface , thereby doubling the number of charge carriers compared to that obtained from the dissociation of the singlet exciton .",
    "sf - driven strong enhancement of performance has been found in pentacene@xmath0c@xmath5 solar cells , @xcite and the process can clearly have a significant impact on the search for organic solar cells with even higher quantum efficiency .",
    "@xcite the fundamental requirement for efficient sf , based on energetic considerations , is @xmath6s*@xmath7t@xmath8 , where @xmath6s*@xmath9 and @xmath6t@xmath8 are the energies of the singlet optical exciton and the lowest triplet exciton , respectively . among various classes of organic materials fulfilling this requirement , @xcite aggregates of tetracene and pentacene , @xcite acene derivatives , @xcite carotenoids and polyene crystals , @xcite and 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran @xcite exhibit sf with t yield ranging from 100% to 200% .",
    "there also exist tetracene and pentacene derivatives which _ do not _ undergo sf .",
    "@xcite a unified theoretical understanding of sf in the various systems is clearly desirable for the synthesis of new materials exhibiting sf and with potential use in solar cells .",
    "this is the goal of the current theoretical research .",
    "existing theories of sf @xcite have almost universally focused on acenes ( on pentacene in most cases ) , where it is generally agreed upon that sf is a multichromophoric process , and the triplets are generated from a triplet@xmath0triplet ( hereafter @xmath1(tt ) ) state with two triplet excitons localized on different chromophores and with overall spin angular momentum of zero .",
    "the @xmath1(tt ) state is also referred to as a multiexciton ( hereafter me ) in the literature , as it is predominantly a correlated two electron@xmath0two hole ( 2e@xmath02h ) excitation from the ground state .",
    "the single question that has been investigated most intensively in this context is whether or not charge - transfer ( ct ) excitons ( hereafter ctx ) mediate the s * to @xmath1(tt ) conversion .",
    "@xcite some investigators have claimed that the @xmath1(tt ) state is reached from s * in a single step , driven by coulomb interactions consisting of two - particle intermolecular electron transfers .",
    "@xcite the origin of this idea lies in the especially rapid sf in pentacene , where sf occurs in @xmath10 80 fs .",
    "@xcite according to these authors , mediation by the ctx , being necessarily a two - step process ( s * @xmath11 ctx @xmath11 @xmath1(tt ) ) , would make @xmath1(tt ) generation and the sf following it much slower .",
    "this viewpoint has been contradicted by the proponents of the ctx - mediated mechanism , @xcite who believe that the only requirement for the two - step process to be ultrafast is that s * and @xmath1(tt ) are of nearly the same energy .",
    "additional justification of the ctx - mediated process comes from the matrix element calculations of the coulomb interaction involving two - particle hops , which have found this matrix element too small to explain femtosecond me generation .",
    "@xcite    theories emphasizing ct also differ in details themselves .",
    "a number of them find the ctx significantly higher in energy than s * , @xcite in which case a superexchange like mechanism of @xmath1(tt ) generation from s * has been suggested . yet",
    "other mechanisms have also been proposed .",
    "time - resolved experiments have been interpreted as showing direct photoexcitation of a coherent superposition of s * and @xmath1(tt ) .",
    "@xcite yamagata @xcite and beljonne et al . , @xcite based on their fitting of the davydov splittings in the absorption spectra of the acenes , claim that optical excitation here is to a state that is a quantum mechanical superposition of s * and ctx and that transition from this optically accessible state to the @xmath1(tt ) occurs in a virtual one - step process .",
    "these authors have however also found that for intermolecular separation _ smaller _ than the equilibrium distance ( i.e. , very large intermolecular hopping ) direct optical excitation to a state that is a superposition of s * , ctx , and @xmath1(tt ) is possible .",
    "zeng et al . @xcite",
    "arrive at the same conclusion , but once again , only for artificially large intermolecular couplings .",
    "finally , it has been suggested that sf occurs directly from s * , without going through any real or virtual intermediate state .",
    "@xcite    the above disagreements are largely due to the absence of understanding of the precise natures and relative energies of the electronic states relevant to sf .",
    "equally importantly , there exist several additional questions beyond those that have been investigated so far .",
    "first , how do morphology and environment influence sf ?",
    "it has been widely observed experimentally that structural arrangement of the chromophores often determines whether or not sf efficiency is high .",
    "@xcite second , what is the mechanism of sf in carotenoid aggregates , @xcite in which the well - known intramolecular 2@xmath1a@xmath12 state , which is a quantum - entangled single - molecule state of two triplets , @xcite occurs below the optical 1@xmath1b@xmath13 exciton ?",
    "@xcite ( here the superscript @xmath14 indicates spin singlet nature of the eigenstate while the `` plus '' and `` minus '' superscripts refer to the charge - conjugation symmetry ) .",
    "is sf here monomolecular , with the triplet excitons originating from the dissociation of the 2@xmath1a@xmath12 , or is the mechanism of triplet generation the same as in acenes ? in either case ,",
    "why is sf in carotenoids significantly slower @xcite than in crystalline pentacene ?",
    "third , as has been noted by several research groups , although @xmath6s*@xmath15t@xmath8 in tetracene , @xcite a simple activated mechanism for sf appears to fail .",
    "@xcite what precisely is behind this complex exciton dynamics ? finally , beyond the simple acenes and their derivatives , sf",
    "has also been experimentally studied in the so - called covalently linked acene dimers .",
    "@xcite however , unlike acene crystals or even disordered films , @xcite little to no sf occurs in the dimer molecules .",
    "@xcite there have been few , if any , theoretical discussions of sf in covalently linked acene dimers ; @xcite whether or not the low yield of triplets in them can be understood within a comprehensive theory of sf remains an open question .",
    "our goal in the present work is to arrive at a broad theoretical framework for sf that can give qualitative and , wherever possible , semiquantitative answers to the above questions . unlike existing quantum chemical approaches to sf",
    ", we make no attempt to calculate transition rates between excited states .",
    "this is because estimates of transition rates depend heavily on the calculated relative _ energies _ of initial and final states , which include the one electron - one hole ( 1e@xmath01h ) optical exciton and the ctx , as well as the 2e@xmath02h @xmath1(tt ) state and the 2@xmath1a@xmath2 .",
    "treating 1e@xmath01h and 2e@xmath02h excitations on equal footing remains difficult for molecules with more than 8@xmath010 electrons within first principles approaches .",
    "getting the correct energy ordering of 2e@xmath02h excitations in general requires configuration interaction ( ci ) with up to quadruple excitations ( quadruple ci , hereafter qci ) from the ground state . @xcite over and above in the present case such calculations have to be performed for aggregates ( at least dimers ) of large molecules and lie outside the scope of standard quantum chemical techniques .",
    "theoretical approaches to sf therefore mostly involve calculations based on a few excitations across a limited number of frontier molecular orbitals ( mos ) of pairs of molecules .",
    "we will show that such approximations can lead to errors in the quantum mechanical descriptions of the multichromophore eigenstates relevant in sf .",
    "for our modeling of chromophore clusters we therefore take the opposite approach here and employ the semiempirical pariser@xmath0parr@xmath0pople ( ppp ) @xmath3-electron hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite our approach allows us to perform ci calculations retaining up to quadruple excitations across a very large number of mos ( including the complete set in some cases ) , thereby ensuring accurate cluster excited state energy orderings .",
    "if one now makes the reasonable assumptions that ( i ) efficient transitions can occur between energetically proximate states and ( ii ) for sf to occur the @xmath1(tt ) should be either the _ lowest _ excited state of the cluster or must be close in energy to an optical state , then a physical understanding of sf can be obtained from the excited state energy spectrum alone .",
    "the ppp hamiltonian has successfully addressed correlation effects in a variety of single chromophore systems @xcite and in recent years has also reproduced experimental features in multichromophore systems . @xcite in the present case , we will for the first time give a precise explanation of why sf in polyenes is multichromophoric , and the 2@xmath1a@xmath2 plays no role .",
    "a natural explanation of the much slower sf rate in polyenes compared to pentacene also emerges from our work .",
    "new insights on sf and exciton dynamics in tetracene , which have remained considerably less understood than in pentacene , are obtained .",
    "finally , we give a clear explanation of the very low sf yield in covalently linked acene dimers .",
    "it is only through high - order ci studies of the ppp model that such a unified picture is obtained .",
    "* model hamiltonian . * we report qci calculations for clusters of chromophores based on the modified ppp hamiltonian consisting of _ intra _ and _ inter_chromophore terms @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 creates a @xmath3-electron of spin @xmath20 on carbon ( c ) atom @xmath21 located in chromophore @xmath22 ; @xmath23 is the number of electrons of spin @xmath20 on atom @xmath21 within chromophore @xmath22 , and @xmath24 .",

    "* computational approach .",
    "* we use a basis of _ localized _",
    "hartree@xmath0fock ( hf ) mos of the individual molecular units in our calculations .",
    "@xcite this allows a clear distinction between excitations localized on a single molecule versus those that are delocalized over multiple molecules , as well as quantum mechanical superposition of these extreme configurations . for the very largest systems we are forced to ignore some of the outermost hf mos in our qci calculations .",
    "the number of mos we have retained in all cases ( cf . supporting information ) is however significantly larger than what are retained within existing calculations .",
    "@xcite for precise classification of all excited states proximate to the optical exciton in a multichromophore system , the qci wave function of the @xmath36th excited state is expanded in terms of single , double , triple , and quadruple e@xmath0h excitation configurations @xmath37 where within each class the @xmath38 s are sorted in a descending order . for each eigenstate",
    "we now calculate the wave function _ character density _",
    "@xmath39 , corresponding to each class of excitations @xmath21 ( thus the calculated @xmath40 for a given eigenstate allows us to classify it as predominantly 1e@xmath01h , predominantly 2e@xmath02h , ... etc . ) . in what follows we ignore configurations with @xmath41 and also 3e@xmath03h and 4e@xmath04h excitations ( 3e@xmath03h and 4e@xmath04h excitations in any event have @xmath41 )",
    "on the basis of such detailed analyses of the wave functions we are able to further classify @xcite eigenstates dominated by 1e@xmath01h excitations as ( i ) frenkel exciton ( hereafter exc ) , if the excited electron and hole are localized on a monomer , ( ii ) polaron pair ( hereafter p@xmath32p@xmath33 ) if the electron and hole are completely charge separated and lie on different molecules , and ( iii ) ctx , if the wave function is a superposition of exc and p@xmath32p@xmath33 .",
    "similarly , eigenstates dominated by 2e@xmath02h excitations can have both excitations on the single monomer or on different monomers . in the energy region of interest ( near and below the optical exciton ) , 2e@xmath02h excitations localized on a monomer are the predominant constituents of the 2@xmath1a@xmath2 as well as of optically dark @xmath1b@xmath42 states ( with additional contributions coming from configurations that are exc ) . @xcite these excited states are quantum - entangled triplet@xmath0triplet states , where both triplet excitations occupy the same molecule . in the language of valence bond theory , these spin singlet excited states are _ covalent _ , @xcite as opposed to the _ ionic _ exc states ( 2e@xmath02h states can also be singlet@xmath0singlet ; in this case they are doubly ionic , with two pairs of c@xmath32 and c@xmath33 ions ; these have energies nearly twice that of the optical exciton @xcite and are not of interest here )",
    ". we will label such monomer 2e@xmath02h @xmath1a@xmath2 and @xmath1b@xmath42 excitations collectively as cov .",
    "finally , there exist also eigenstates dominated by 2e@xmath02h excitations in which two 1e@xmath01h excitations occur on different monomers .",
    "these are overall spin singlet excitations consisting of two triplets on two monomers , which we will label as ( tt)@xmath34 , where @xmath36 is a measure of the separation between the triplet excitations ( @xmath43 corresponds to nearest - neighbor triplets , @xmath44 as next nearest neighbor , ... , etc . ) . in scheme",
    "[ s1]a@xmath0d we have given the schematics of exc , p@xmath32p@xmath33 , cov , and ( tt)@xmath34 excitations , respectively , for a dimer of two chromophores c1 and c2 , where , however , we have included only the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied mos ( homo and lumo , respectively ) in describing them .",
    "the actual wave functions can have contributions from excitations across much larger one - electron gaps .",
    "note that the ( tt)@xmath34 configuration is a normalized superposition of three fundamental configurations , and the formal expression in the limited homo@xmath0lumo basis of scheme  [ s1 ] is @xmath45|g\\rangle \\label{tt - wfn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) creates an electron in the homo ( lumo ) of molecule @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the hf ground state .",
    "there are three distinct terms ( since @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) which correspond to ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) = ( @xmath54 ) ; ( @xmath55 ) ; and ( @xmath56 ) excitations on the individual units , where @xmath57 is the @xmath58 component of the spin on molecule @xmath21 . using the same limited homo@xmath0lumo basis ,",
    "the other three classes of excitations in scheme  [ s1 ] are written as    @xmath59    [ other - wfn ]    only the `` plus '' superposition in eq  [ other - wfn]a is dipole allowed ; the `` minus '' superposition is an optically `` dark '' exciton .",
    "ctx states are superpositions of exc and p@xmath32p@xmath33 with varying relative weights .    for further clarifications of our labeling scheme we note the following .",
    "first , multiple - chromophore systems are expected to have multiple excitonic states that are dipole - allowed , which is the origin of the experimentally observed davydov splitting in these systems .",
    "second , however , not all exc states are optically allowed .",
    "particularly when the two molecules in a dimer cluster are related by any symmetry operation , the odd superposition of the excitations on two molecules that are otherwise equivalent will be optically dark .    * parameters . * our parametrizations of @xmath60 are as follows .",
    "the intramolecular hopping integrals are @xmath61 ev for the phenyl c@xmath0c bonds unless otherwise stated and @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) ev for the single ( double ) bonds .",
    "these values are accepted as standard within correlated - electron models @xcite ( noninteracting hckel models often use larger hopping integrals @xmath64 to @xmath65 ev in order to fit experimentally observed optical absorptions ; such large values are neither appropriate nor necessary when coulomb interactions are nonzero ) .",
    "the intramolecular intersite interactions are obtained from parametrization of the ppp model obtained previously , @xcite @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the distance in @xmath68 between c atoms @xmath21 and @xmath26 and @xmath69 is an effective dielectric constant . for the linear polyene calculations reported below , we use @xmath70 ev and @xmath71 . these parameters have been used extensively in the past , @xcite including for linear polyenes , @xcite in all cases with excellent fits to experimentally determined singlet and triplet excitation energies .",
    "the coulomb interaction parameters that we chose for our calculations on the acenes are slightly smaller , in order to reproduce the experimentally obtained energies of the spin triplet excitons ( see below ) .    for @xmath72",
    ", we have chosen the same functional form for the intermolecular coulomb interactions @xmath31 as in @xmath60 .",
    "the value of the intermolecular screening parameter @xmath73 is uncertain ; we have taken this to be the same as the intramolecular screening parameter @xmath69 for simplicity .",
    "the intermolecular hopping integrals between c atoms @xmath21 and @xmath26 are obtained by adjusting @xmath74 in the expression @xcite @xmath75(\\frac{\\hat{\\bf n}_1\\cdot\\vec{\\bf r}_{ij}}{r_{ij}})(\\frac{\\hat{\\bf n}_2\\cdot\\vec{\\bf r}_{ij}}{r_{ij}})\\ ] ] with @xmath76 being the distance between the closest two c atoms located on two separate chromophores , @xmath74 the hopping integral between those two c atoms , and @xmath77 nm . unit vectors @xmath78 and @xmath79 are normal to the surfaces of the chromophores 1 and 2 on atoms @xmath21 and @xmath26 , respectively",
