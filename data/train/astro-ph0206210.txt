    "brown dwarfs ( bds ) occupy the substellar mass domain . having masses lower than 75 m@xmath1 , they are unable to burn hydrogen steadily .",
    "although their presence has been already predicted in the sixties by @xcite , their low luminosity delayed their discovery until 1995 , when @xcite announced the first detection of a bd orbiting the nearby m - dwarf star gl229a .",
    "recently , the large - scale near - infrared ( nir ) surveys 2mass and denis  complemented by optical data  substantially increased the number of known field bds . additionally , deep nir surveys of star - forming regions revealed hundreds of young bd candidates .    in spite of the rapidly growing number of known bds @xcite",
    ", we do not know if they form like planets or like stars .",
    "proposed scenarios include the straightforward star - like formation via fragmentation and disk accretion @xcite , the ejection of stellar embryos @xcite from multiple systems and the formation in circumstellar disks like giant planets .",
    "the presence of disks and their properties are crucial in distinguishing between the various scenarios : a truncated disk ( size of a few au ) would support the ejected stellar embryo hypothesis , a non - truncated one is the sign of stellar - like accretion , while bds formed like planets should have no dust around them .    in the case of bds ,",
    "nir data are not necessarily a good tracer of disk emission because they are strongly affected by molecular bands of the cool bd atmosphere .",
    "since the emission of warm ( 100 - 400 k ) circumstellar dust peaks around 10 , mid - infrared ( mir ) excess emission  arising from dust grains close to the star  is the best tool to search for circumstellar disks .",
    "the mir regime is best accessed by space - born telescopes , the last of which was the infrared space observatory ( iso ) , operating between 1995 - 1998 .",
    "however , the majority of bds has been discovered too late to be targeted by iso .    up to now , only few bds with mir excess are known .",
    "these objects , identified in the isocam archive , are located in the cha i or in the @xmath2 ophiuchi star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "their substellar nature has been deduced from comparing nir and optical measurements to evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a model based on scaled - down disks around pre - main - sequence stars to explain the measured spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "they followed the chiang & goldreich disk geometry which has been rather successfull in describing seds of t tauri and herbig ae / be stars @xcite .",
    "the main assumption here is the flaring of the disk , which introduces a superheated surface layer , called the disk atmosphere ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "this optically thin layer produces a strong silicate emission feature around 9.7  ( si  o stretching mode ) . in an optically thick flat disk",
    ", no such feature is expected .",
    "therefore , the presence or lack of such a feature is a strong constraint to any disk model .    in this paper we present results from our timmi2 mir imaging campaign .",
    "our aim was to detect mir excess emission and thus to probe the presence of warm circumstellar dust around bds .",
    "we targeted 8 very close field bds of various ages and a young bd candidate in the cha i star - forming region .",
    "our observations are the first data in the wavelength region of the silicate feature .",
    "we carried out deep mir observations with the 3.6m / eso telescope at la silla ( chile ) using the timmi2 camera @xcite in 2001 november and december .",
    "the targets were 8 field bds and a young bd in the cha i star - forming region . from the closest field bds , we selected those which seemed to be the youngest based on their brightness and spectral type .",
    "we used the 9.8  filter , where the instrument is the most sensitive , to search for disk emission . in the case of the detected field bd we also complemented the 9.8  measurement with 5 and 11.9  observations ; the bd detected in the cha i region was also observed at 11.9 .",
    "we applied long exposure times ( typically 2 hrs in each filter ) in order to reach the @xmath310 mjy sensitivity limit of the instrument .",
    "extensive testing of the pointing accuracy shows a typical error not larger than 1.5 towards the cha i star - forming region .",
    "this excludes any confusion with other sources .",
    "among the 8 targeted nearby field bds , only the object lp 944 - 20 could be detected .",
    "table [ tab1 ] summarizes the names and coordinates of the non - detected bds .",
    "the 3 @xmath4 upper limit of the flux density for these sources is 15 mjy at 9.8 .    as one of the youngest ( 475 - 650 myr ) and closest ( 5 pc ) field bds @xcite , lp 944 - 20 was the most promising of our targets .",
    "based on its optical spectrum , its spectral type is equal to or later than m9v @xcite .",
    "its classification as a bd has been confirmed by the presence of lithium in its photosphere @xcite .",
    "excellent atmospheric conditions and a long integration time led to the _ first detection of a field bd in the mir_. the fluxes measured at 5 , 9.8 and 11.9 are 39 mjy , 24 mjy , and 22 mjy , respectively .",
    "these measurements correspond to more than 5 @xmath4 detections in each filter .",
    "we estimate a photometric error smaller than 15% for each measurement .",
    "in contrast to the older field bds , we found clear evidence for excess mir emission in the case of the much younger ( 2 - 4.5 myr ) bd candidate cha h@xmath02 .",
    "the observed fluxes are 17@xmath52 and 21@xmath53 mjy at 9.8 and 11.9 , respectively .",
    "the object is close to or in the substellar domain , depending on its exact age @xcite .",
    "there is some evidence that cha h@xmath02 is actually a close binary with the components in the substellar domain @xcite .",
    "the non - detection of the 7 field bds proves the lack of significant amount of warm dust around older field bds .",
    "these data clearly show that the disk dissipation time is below a few 100 myr , consistent with recent measurements of bds in the young @xmath4 orionis cluster @xcite .",
    "even the detection of the closest target , the 475 - 650 myr old lp 944 - 20 , confirms this hypothesis .",
    "compared to a simple blackbody with t@xmath6=2300 k , r@xmath6=0.1 r@xmath7 , d=5 pc @xcite , it is clear that our measurements show no mir excess , but the photospheric flux of the bd itself .",
    "a black body with a temperature and radius corresponding to the classification of cha h@xmath02 fails to reproduce the observed fluxes that are an order of magnitude higher .",
    "this excess , previously observed by iso @xcite , was interpreted as emerging from a circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "our ground - based data corroborate the presence of a disk , and adds important constraints to the models .    the very low extinction towards cha h@xmath02 ( a@xmath80.4 mag , @xcite ) argues for a nearly face - on disk , where a strong silicate emission feature would be expected from the superheated layer of a flared disk . using the chiang ",
    "goldreich model @xcite predict a 10  emission stronger than 40 mjy .",
    "in contrast , we measured fluxes of 17@xmath52 and 21@xmath53 mjy at 9.8 and 11.9 , respectively .",
    "the same flux densities at the peak and on the wing of the feature exclude the presence of any silicate feature .    in order to understand the reason of the model s deviation from the observations , we inspect its parameters and structure . the chiang ",
    "goldreich model consists of three major components : the star , the optically thin disk atmosphere and the optically thick disk interior ( see figure [ figure1 ] ) . in the mir",
    "the stellar radiation is well approximated by a black body , while the optically thick disk emission is given by a power law @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "a simple analytical formula is used to describe the optically thin disk atmosphere , which is producing the silicate emission @xcite .    changing the disk geometry ( inner and outer radii , scale height , inclination )",
    "is insufficient to explain the observed sed .",
    "altering the optical properties ( or composition ) of the dust grains has a stronger effect : the absence of the silicate feature could be explained by the lack of this dust component or the presence of large grains ( radii larger than 5 ) .",
    "however , we stress that the power law continuum @xmath9 , predicted by _ the flared model , does not fit our data_.    a much simpler and more straightforward solution is the assumption that the bd is surrounded by an optically thick flat disk .",
    "we assume a power law disk with a surface density of @xmath10 and a temperature of @xmath11 which are typical of reprocessing and viscous disks @xcite . since this disk is entirely optically thick , its sed is independent of the dust properties .",
    "_ the model does not show any feature .",
    "the continuum of a power - law flat disk has the observed slope_. in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] we compare the measurements with model predictions .",
    "our ground - based measurements represent a new way of probing the properties of disks around bds , exploring their spectral energy distribution and therefore constraining model prescriptions .",
    "we prove the absence of the previously predicted silicate emission feature in the case of the face - on disk around the young bd - candidate cha h@xmath02 , one of the three known bd - candidates with mir excess .",
    "an optically thick flat disk provides a perfect match to our data . because no evidence for disks around older field bds could be detected",
    ", disk dissipation times must be shorter than a few 100 myr .",
    "our results suggest that newborn bds have disks like young , low - mass stars , but also indicate unexpected differences in their disk geometry .",
    "the next step in the investigation of disks around young bds is the search for millimetre emission to detect the outer parts of the disks and to go to fainter objects with the space - based sirtf mission .",
