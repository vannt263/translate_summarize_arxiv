    "the type ia supernova ( sne ia ) explorations @xcite , the cosmic microwave background(cmb ) results from wmap @xcite observations , and surveys of galaxies @xcite all suggest that the universe is speeding up rather than slowing down .",
    "the accelerated expansion of the present universe is usually attributed to the fact that dark energy is an exotic component with negative pressure .",
    "many kinds of dark energy models have already been constructed such as @xmath10cdm @xcite , quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) @xcite , quintom @xcite , holographic dark energy @xcite , and so forth .    on the other hand , to remove the dependence of special properties of extra energy components , a parameterized equation of state ( eos ) is assumed for dark energy .",
    "this is also commonly called the model - independent method .",
    "the parameterized eos of dark energy which is popularly used in parameter best fit estimations , describes the possible evolution of dark energy .",
    "for example , @xmath11=const @xcite , @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 ( here @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 , or @xmath19 , @xmath20 are obtained by the best fit estimations from cosmic observational datasets .",
    "it is well known that the gcg model has been widely used to interpret the accelerating universe . in the gcg approach",
    ", dark energy and dark matter can be unified by using an exotic equation of state .",
    "also , a modified chaplygin gas ( mcg ) as a extension of the generalized chaplygin gas model has already been applied to describe the current accelerating expansion of the universe @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite . the constraint on parameter b in mcg model , i.e. , the added parameter relative to gcg model , is discussed briefly by using the location of the peak of the cmb radiation spectrum in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this letter",
    ", we study the constraints on the best fit parameters ( @xmath21,@xmath3 ) and eos in the mcg model from recently observed data : the latest observations of the 182 gold type ia supernovae ( sne ) @xcite , the 3-year wmap cmb shift parameter @xcite and the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak from sloan digital sky surver ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "the result of this study indicates that the best fit value of parameters ( @xmath21,@xmath3 ) in mcg model are ( -0.085,0.822,1.724 ) .",
    "furthermore , we find the best fit @xmath4 crosses -1 in the past and the present best fit value @xmath5 , and the @xmath6 confidence level of @xmath7 is @xmath22 . at last , because the emphasis of the ongoing and forthcoming research is shifting from estimating specific parameters of the cosmological model to model selection @xcite , it is interesting to estimate which model for an accelerating universe is distinguish by statistical analysis of observational datasets out of a large number of cosmological models . therefore , by applying the recent observational data to the alaike information criterion ( aic ) of model selection , we compare the mcg model with other seven general cosmological models to see which model is better .",
    "it is found that the mcg model has almost the same support from the data as other popular models . in the letter , we perform an estimation of model parameters using a standard minimization procedure based on the maximum likelihood method .    the letter is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the mcg model is introduced briefly . in section 3 ,",
    "the best fit value of parameters ( @xmath21,@xmath3 ) in the mcg model are given from the recent observations of sne ia , cmb and bao , and we present the evolution of the best fit of @xmath4 with @xmath6 confidence level with respect to redshift @xmath23 .",
    "the preferred cosmological model is discussed in section 4 according to the aic .",
    "section 5 is the conclusion .",
    "for the modified chaplygin gas model , the energy density @xmath24 and pressure @xmath25 are related by the equation of state @xcite    @xmath26    where @xmath27 and @xmath3 are parameters in the model .",
    "considering the frw cosmology , by using the energy conservation equation : @xmath28 , the energy density of mcg can be derived as @xcite @xmath29^{\\frac 1{1+\\alpha } } , \\label{2}\\ ] ] for a @xmath30 -1 , where @xmath31 is the scale factor , b@xmath32 . in order to unify dark matter and dark energy for the mcg model , the mcg fluid is decomposed into two components : the dark energy component and the dark matter component , i.e. , @xmath33 , @xmath34 . then according to the relation between the density of dark matter and redshift : @xmath35 the energy density of the dark energy in the mcg model can be given by @xmath36^{\\frac 1{1+\\alpha } } -\\rho _ { 0dm}(1+z)^3.\\label{4}\\ ] ]    next , we assume",
    "the universe is filled with two components , one is the mcg component , and the other is baryon matter component , ie . , @xmath37 the equation of state of dark energy can be derived as @xcite    @xmath38^{-\\frac \\alpha { 1+\\alpha } } [ -b_s+b(1-b_s)(1+z)^{3(1+b)(1+\\alpha ) } ] } { ( 1-\\omega _ { 0b})[b_s+(1-b_s)(1+z)^{3(1+b)(1+\\alpha ) } ] ^{\\frac 1{1+\\alpha } } -\\omega _ { 0dm}(1+z)^3},\\label{5}\\ ] ]    where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are present values of the dimensionless dark matter density and baryon matter component .",
    "furthermore , in a flat universe , making use of the friedmann equation , the hubble parameter @xmath41 can be written as    @xmath42    where @xmath43 ( 1-@xmath44)[@xmath45@xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 denotes the present value of the hubble parameter . when @xmath48 , equation ( [ 6 ] ) is reduced to the gcg scenario .",
    "in the following section , on the basis of equation ( [ 6 ] ) , we will apply the recently observed data to find the best fit parameters ( @xmath49,@xmath3 ) in mcg model . for simplicity",
    ", we will displace parameters ( @xmath49,@xmath3 ) with @xmath50 in the following section .",
    "since type ia supernovae behave as excellent standard candles , they can be used to directly measure the expansion rate of the universe up to high redshifts ( @xmath51 ) for comparison with the present rate .",
    "therefore , they provide direct information on the universe@xmath52s acceleration and constrain the dark energy model .",
    "theoretical dark energy model parameters are determined by minimizing the quantity @xmath53 where @xmath54 for the gold sne ia data @xcite , @xmath55 are errors due to flux uncertainties , intrinsic dispersion of sne ia absolute magnitude and peculiar velocity dispersion respectively .",
    "the theoretical distance modulus @xmath56 is defined as @xmath57 where @xmath58 @xmath59 is given by supernovae dataset , and @xmath60 is the luminosity distance .",
    "the structure of the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation depends on two eras in cosmology , i.e. , last scattering and today .",
    "they can also be applied to limit the model parameters of dark energy by using the shift parameter @xcite , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the redshift of recombination , @xmath63 is present value of the dimensionless matter density , including dark matter and the baryon matter component . by using the three - year wmap data @xcite , @xmath64 can be obtained as @xcite @xmath65 from the cmb constraint , the best fit value of parameters in the dark energy models can be determined by minimizing @xmath66    because the universe has a fraction of baryons , the acoustic oscillations in the relativistic plasma would be imprinted onto the late - time power spectrum of the nonrelativistic matter @xcite .",
    "therefore , the acoustic signatures in the large - scale clustering of galaxies can also serve as a test to constrain models of dark energy with detection of a peak in the correlation function of luminous red galaxies in the sdss @xcite . by using the equation @xmath67^{2/3},\\label{13}\\ ] ] and @xmath68 measured from the sdss data , @xmath69",
    ", we can minimize the @xmath70defined as @xcite @xmath71    as one can find that the gravitational clustering in mcg model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , ensures that the observational datasets from cmb and bao can be applied to constrain the mcg model .",
    "hence , we combine these three datasets to minimize the total likelihood @xmath72 @xmath73    on the one hand , since we are interested in the model parameters @xmath50 , the @xmath47 contained in @xmath74 is a nuisance parameter and will be marginalized by integrating the likelihood @xmath75 @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the prior distribution function of the present hubble constant , and a gaussian prior @xmath78 @xcite is adopted in the letter . we know that the prior knowledge of cosmological parameter @xmath40 has been obtained by several other observations , such as @xmath79 from the observation of the deuterium to hydrogen ratio towards qso absorption systems @xcite , @xmath80 from the boomerang data @xcite and @xmath81 from the dasi results @xcite for the observation of cmb .",
    "thus , in order to get the interesting result for the value of @xmath40 , we treat @xmath40 as a free parameter with gaussian prior distribution centered in @xmath82 with spread @xmath83 . and following ref .",
    "@xcite , the `` weak '' prior for parameter @xmath40 will be used in our analysis , i.e. , let it have a relative larger variable range @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath74 in equation ( [ 15 ] ) will be reconstructed as @xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the total @xmath87 obtained without imposing prior knowledge of @xmath40 .     with 1@xmath88 confidence level ( shaded region).,title=\"fig : \" ] +    by using the maximum likelihood method for equation ( [ 16 ] ) , we obtain the best fit values @xmath89 in the mcg model ( 0.041,-0.085,0.822,1.724 ) with @xmath90 .",
    "figure 1 shows the @xmath6 confidence level of the best fit @xmath4 calculated by using the covariance matrix . from fig.1 , it is easy to see that the best fit @xmath4 cross -1 at about @xmath91 and the present best fit value @xmath5 .",
    "obviously , it can be shown that the fact that @xmath4 cross over the boundary of @xmath92 in mcg model is consistent with the results given by refs .",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite , where @xmath4 crossing -1 is first found using sne data .",
    "furthermore , we obtain the @xmath6 confidence level of @xmath7 , @xmath22 .",
    "the possibility of @xmath93 cann@xmath52 t be excluded in @xmath6 level . at last",
    ", it can be seen that the cosmological constant model ( i.e.,@xmath94 ) is not in @xmath6 confidence contour of the best fit dynamical @xmath4 .",
    "it is interesting to ask which model of an accelerating universe is preferred by recently observed data over many models .",
    "we also want to know how well the mcg model fits the recently observed datasets as compared to other models .",
    "we make use of the values of @xmath9 and the objective alaike information criterion ( aic ) to solve the questions above .    on the basis of the description in section 3",
    ", we obtain the values of @xmath95 by minimizing the @xmath96 in the corresponding models , where @xmath63 is treated as a free parameter with a gaussian prior in the range @xmath97 @xcite for the @xmath10cdm model and model - independent cases , and the results are listed in table 1 .",
    "it can be seen that the mcg model has the smallest @xmath9 value .",

    "please see refs .",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .    in what follows",
    ", we will estimate which model is the better one for all the models in table 2 .",
    "the value of aic has no meaning by itself for a single model and only the relative value between different models are physically interesting .",
    "therefore , by comparing several models the one which minimizes the aic is usually considered the best , and denoted by aic@xmath127@xmath128min@xmath129 aic@xmath130 , @xmath131@xmath132 , where @xmath131 is a set of alternative candidate models . the relative strength of evidence for each model can be obtained by calculating the likelihood of the model @xmath133 exp @xmath134 , where @xmath135 aic@xmath136aic@xmath127 over the whole range of alternative models .",
    "the akaike weight @xmath137 is calculated by normalizing the relative likelihood to unity and corresponds to posterior probability of a model .",

    "table 2 gives the calculating results .",
    "note that the model selection provides quantitative information to judge the `` strength of evidence '' , not just a way to select only one model . from table 2",
    "it is easy to see that , the mcg model has almost the same support from the data as the best model , because the value of @xmath144 for it is in the range 0 - 2 .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that the recent observational data supports all of the models in table 2 except for the case of @xmath12 since the value of @xmath143 for this case is a little bigger than 2 .",
    "it has a less support from recent observations . on the other hand",
    ", we can see that the mcg model is favored by observational data more than gcg model according to the akaike weights @xmath137 in table 2 .",
    "finally , the odds indicates the difference between mcg model and the best one is 2.198 to 1 .",
    "in summary , the constraints on the mcg model , proposed as a candidate of the unified dark matter - dark energy scenario , has been studied in this letter .",
    "we obtained the best fit value of the three parameters ( @xmath1,@xmath2,@xmath3 ) in the mcg model ( -0.085,0.822,1.724 ) .",
    "meanwhile , it is easy to see that the best fit @xmath4 can cross -1 as it evolves with the redshift @xmath23 , and the present best fit value @xmath5 .",
