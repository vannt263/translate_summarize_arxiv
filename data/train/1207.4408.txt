    "it has been well established from astrophysical and cosmological observations that nearly 85@xmath0 of the matter in the universe consists of invisible dark matter ( dm ) . so far",
    "the evidence of dm arise solely from its gravitational interactions .",
    "popular dm candidates , such as the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) can naturally reproduce the observed relic density through weak interactions with the standard model ( sm ) particles .",
    "this possibility has motivated numerous experiments to probe the direct or indirect signals of dm interacting with ordinary matter .",
    "some of the recent dm direct detection experiments such as dama @xcite , cogent @xcite and cresst - ii @xcite have reported events in excess of known backgrounds . the excess events ,",
    "if interpreted in terms of dm particle elastic scattering off target nuclei , may imply light dm particles with mass around 8 - 10 gev and scattering cross section around @xmath1 .",
    "other experiments such as cdms - ii @xcite , xenon10/100 @xcite , and simple @xcite etc . , have reported null results in the same dm mass range .",
    "the understanding of the backgrounds and systematic uncertainties in the current experiments still needs to be improved . at the moment , it is premature to draw a conclusion based on a single experimental result .",
    "a commonly adopted assumption on interpreting the dm direct detection data is that in spin - independent scatterings the dm particle couplings to proton @xmath2 and to neutron @xmath3 are nearly the same , i.e. @xmath4 , which makes it straight forward to extract the dm - nucleon scattering cross sections .",
    "however , in generic cases , the interactions may be isospin - violating  @xcite . in the scenario of isospin",
    "violating dm ( ivdm ) , the dm particle couples to proton and neutron with different strengths , possible destructive interference between the two couplings can weaken the bounds from xenon10/100 and move the signal regions of dama and cogent to be closer to each other @xcite . in order to reconcile the data of dama , cogent and xenon10/100 , a large destructive interference corresponding to @xmath5",
    "is favored @xcite .",
    "recently , the xenon100 collaboration has reported updated results based on the exposure of 225 days with 34 kg fiducial mass @xcite .",
    "two events are observed with background expectation of @xmath6 events ( @xmath7 from gammas and @xmath8 from neutrons ) .",
    "the updated upper bound on the spin - independent scattering cross section is @xmath9 at 90@xmath0 confidence level ( cl ) for a 55 gev dm particle , which is improved by a factor of 3.5 in comparison with the previous result reported in 2011 @xcite .",
    "for an 8 gev dm particle , the limit is improved by a factor of five .",
    "such a significant improvement may allow the xenon100 result to challenge the dama and gogent results even in the scenario of ivdm .    as a consequence of @xmath5 , the absolute values @xmath10 have to be around two order of magnitudes larger than that obtained under the assumption of ic interaction . at quark level",
    ", this means that the absolute dm couplings to the first generation @xmath11- and @xmath12-quarks must be enhanced by the same order of magnitudes .",
    "the scenario of ivdm with such light dm masses and relatively large couplings to light quarks can be tested in other processes in which there is no destructive interference .",
    "for instance , the light dm particles can be pair produced at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and the tevatron with signals of a single jet / photon plus a large missing transverse energy , i.e. a mono - jet / mono - photon .",
    "the current null search results from lhc @xcite and tevatron @xcite can be used to impose constraints on the dm - quark couplings @xcite and the ivdm @xcite .    as the inverse processes of dm production",
    ", light dm particles can annihilate into light - quark pairs in the galactic halo , which provides exotic sources of cosmic gamma rays , neutrinos and antiprotons .",
    "the annihilation processes occur at low velocities @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the speed of light , which can be used to test the ivdm complementary to that at the lhc and tevatron . for such low energy processes",
    ", the effective operator approach can be valid as long as the intermediate mediator particles are significantly heavier than the dm particle , but could be much lighter than the tev scale ( for recent discussions , see e.g. refs .",
    "possible constraints from the cosmic neutrinos and gamma ray on ivdm have been discussed in refs .",
    "recently the bess - polar ii experiment has measured the antiproton flux in the energy range from 0.2 gev to 3.5 gev @xcite which have higher precision compared with that from pamela @xcite at low energies .",
    "the antiproton flux in this energy range can receive significant contributions from the annihilation of 10 gev scale dm particles , provided that the annihilation cross section is not velocity suppressed .",
    "the constraints from bess - polar ii data have been investigated recently for typical thermal wimp using semi - analytical approach @xcite .",
    "the constraints on the ivdm was briefly discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite which however did not provide a detailed analysis on the model parameters and uncertainties . in this work , we shall perform a more systematic analysis on implications of the recent cosmic ray antiproton flux data for ivdm , which is based on the fully numerical galprop approach .",
    "we shall compare several propagation models and aim at obtaining conservative upper bounds on the isospin - violating couplings .    for thermal relic dm , the same annihilation process also determines the dm relic density . by requiring that the calculated relic density from a single annihilation channel should not be smaller than the observed value",
    "@xmath15 @xcite , upper bounds on the dm couplings can be obtained .",
    "the bounds could be stringent if the annihilation is dominated by @xmath16-wave processes . for @xmath17-wave annihilation , although the cross section is velocity - suppressed , useful upper bounds can still be obtained as the typical relative velocity of dm particles is finite @xmath18 at freeze out ,    in this work , we first explore the values of dm - nucleon couplings favored by the current experiment under the assumption of ivdm for various target material and values of @xmath19 .",
    "we find that the recently updated xenon100 result is able to rule out the main part of the marginally overlapping signal region between dama and cogent unmodulated data for both the cases with and without considering the surface event rejection factors .",
    "we also show that the tensions between some group of experiments are unlikely to be affected by isospin violation , especially that between dama and simple .",
    "we adopt the effective operator approach to investigate the constraints from the antiproton flux data and the thermal relic density on the couplings between the ivdm and the sm light quarks .",
    "we calculate the antiproton flux using the numerical method implemented in the galprop code @xcite , and consider a number of propagation parameter configurations in order to obtain conservative upper bounds .",
    "the results show that the large and negative value @xmath20 is severely constrained for the operators with velocity - independent annihilation cross sections , such as the fermionic dm with vector couplings and complex scalar dm with scalar couplings . for these operators we also find that the constraints from the cosmic antiproton flux are stronger than that from the thermal relic density .",
    "the relic density can provide useful constraint in the case where the operators contribute only to velocity suppressed annihilation cross sections .",
    "for the complex scalar dm with derivative couplings , we find that the ivdm is in some tension with the relic density .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : ivdm ] , we discuss the effect of ivdm on various target nuclei in different experiments and then explore the allowed dm couplings to nucleons and to light quarks . in section [ sec : effective - interactions ] , we list the effective operators relevant to the ivdm and the related interaction cross sections . in section [ sec :",

    "<S> in the scenario of isospin violating dark matter ( ivdm ) , the dark matter ( dm ) spin - independent couplings to protons and to neutrons are allowed to be different , which has been considered to relax the tensions between the results of dama , cogent and xenon experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the allowed values of dm - nucleon couplings favored and excluded by the current experiments under the assumption of ivdm . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the recently updated xenon100 result excludes the main part of the overlapping signal region between dama and cogent . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the possible tensions between some experiments such as that between dama and simple are unlikely to be affected by isospin violating interactions . in an effective operator approach , </S>",
    "<S> we investigate conservative upper bounds on the dm - quark couplings required by the ivdm scenario from the cosmic ray antiproton fluxes measured recently by bess - polar ii and pamela , and that from the relic density . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the relatively large couplings favored by dama and cogent are tightly constrained , if the operators contribute to velocity - independent annihilation cross sections . for thermal relic dm </S>",
    "<S> , the upper bounds from the relic density can also be stringent . </S>"
