    "an old problem in mathematical physics is how various irregularities influence the asymptotics of the cumulative eigenvalue distribution for a physical resonator .",
    "this problem has many significant physical applications , such as wave scattering from fractal surfaces , liquid flow in porous media , vibrations of cracked bodies or macro - molecules ( polymers ) etc .    in 1910",
    "lorentz put forward the conjecture that the number of eigenmodes up to some ( large ) frequency @xmath0 , depends on the `` volume '' and not on the shape of the resonator .",
    "this was later , proved by weyl , under condition of a sufficiently smooth but otherwise arbitrary boundaries @xcite .",
    "later hunt et al .",
    "@xcite improved this formula by including a correction term which depends on lower powers of the frequency and also on the `` surface area '' of the resonator s perimeter .",
    "berry @xcite , when working on wave scattering from fractal surfaces , generalized the result of hunt et al . to fractal boundaries .",
    "he conjectured that for fractal boundaries with hausdorff dimension @xmath1 , the first correction term should scale as @xmath2 .",
    "however , lapidus has proved @xcite that the correct fractal dimension is not the hausdorff dimension , but another nontrivial dimension known as the minkowski dimension @xmath3 @xcite .    over the last decade or so ,",
    "there have been renewed interest in this , and related problems , both in the mathematics @xcite and physics @xcite communities . in this paper",
    "we consider a related problem where we study a string which has a irregular ( self - affine ) mass density and local elastic coefficient . for a physical realization",
    ", we could for instance think of a long vibrating ( `` fussy '' ) polymer .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we introduce some of the general theoretical background for the problem .",
    "we then in section [ sec:3 ] , make our conjecture for the integrated density of states ( idos ) for our self - affine string based on the results of section [ sec:2 ] . in section [ sec:4 ]",
    "we discuss the decimation technique , the numerical method used to calculated the idos .",
    "the numerical results are presented in section [ sec:5 ] , and the conclusion of this paper is drawn in section [ sec:6 ] .",
    "in this section we review some results which will prove useful in the later discussion .",
    "let @xmath4 be a bounded open set . consider the 1d elliptic differential equation @xmath5 with homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the `` weight function '' @xmath6 , will be assumed to be a positive real valued function .",
    "this equation has a countable sequence of positive eigenvalues ( eigenfrequencies ) tending to infinity .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the integrated density of states ( idos ) , i.e.  the number of eigenmodes with eigenfrequency below @xmath0 .",
    "lapidus and fleckinger @xcite have showed that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath7 is @xmath8 as @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 denotes the volume of the unit ball in @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the resonator domain .",
    "this term is usually called the `` weyl term '' after weyl who first proved this asymptotic behavior for a `` classical '' ( i.e.  non - fractal ) resonator ( the _ weyl conjecture _ ) @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will study the situation where the boundary is regular while the weight - function and/or the elastic coefficient is irregular .",
    "we will use the following physical model : consider a freely vibrating string with fixed endpoints at @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( dirichlet boundary conditions ) .",
    "it has an elastic coefficient @xmath15 and density profile @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are constants and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are strictly positive , self - affine functions . the equation describing the vibrations of this `` rough string '' is @xmath21 if @xmath22 , then @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "we will assume that the elastic coefficient @xmath19 and the density @xmath20 vary in a self - affine way @xcite .",
    "the concept of self - affinity is a scaling property .",
    "a function defined as @xmath24 is said to self - affine if it is statistically invariant under the transformation    [ eq3.1 ] @xmath25 for all positive @xmath26 , or equivalently @xmath27    where @xmath28 is used in order to indicate statistical equality .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 is the hurst exponent ( or roughness exponent ) . when @xmath30 , @xmath31 is not asymptotically flat and the surface is not statistically invariant under translation . when @xmath32 , the variance of @xmath31 diverge when the interval over which it is measures goes to zero .",
    "@xmath31 is then referred to as a _",
    "fractional noise .",
    "_ we will in our analysis assume @xmath33 .",
    "self - affinity is in practice only found within a restricted range of scales . in this work",
    "we explicitly introduce a lower cut - off @xmath34 .",
    "the upper cut - off is the system size @xmath35 , which is the length of the string .",
    "asymptotically , on large scale , @xmath19 and @xmath20 will dominate the behavior of @xmath36 and @xmath37 no matter what @xmath38 and @xmath39 are .",
    "however , we will investigate the system at intermediate scales where the constant terms may or may not dominate over the self - affine terms in @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    we will distinguish four cases :    1 .",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 , 2 .",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath41 , 3 .",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 , 4 .",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath43 ,    where @xmath44 denotes the averaging operator .",
    "we note that the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq2.0 ] ) , @xmath45 $ ] , involves the derivative of a self - affine function , @xmath46 .",
    "this quantity scales as @xmath47 when @xmath48 , while @xmath49 scales as @xmath50 .",
    "thus , we make the assumption that the term containing @xmath46 may be neglected in comparison to the term containing @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.0 ] ) .    with this assumption",
    ", we expect the idos for the self - affine string to behave as ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) @xmath53 in the asymptotic limit .",
    "note that this expression can be written @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the asymptotic behavior of the idos for a rough string is expected to behave as a classical ( non - rough ) string with a constant inverse velocity @xmath55 .",
    "we now discuss the four cases in turn .",
    "assume now that we change the system size according to @xmath56 .",
    "then , for case ( 1 ) ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) after a change of variable , it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eq3.1 ] ) and ( [ eq3.2 ] ) that    [ eq3.3a_whole ] @xmath57 using eq .",
    "( [ eq3.2 ] ) , this relation may be rewritten @xmath58    note that eqs .",
    "( [ eq3.3 ] ) and ( [ eq3.3a ] ) are in principle equivalent , but open up two different possibilities for physical interpretation . in the former case ,",
    "it is the number of eigenmodes which is scaled , while in the latter it is the frequency .    through similar arguments , we find for case ( 2 ) ( @xmath42 and @xmath59 ) ,    [ eq3.3b_whole ] @xmath60 or equivalently @xmath61    for case ( 3 ) ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 )",
    ", we expect    [ eq3.3d_whole ] @xmath64    case ( 4 ) ( @xmath40 and @xmath65 ) leads to the same behavior as case ( 2 ) , eqs .",
    "( [ eq3.3b_whole ] ) .",
    "in order to do numerical simulation of our self - affine string we discretize eq .",
    "( [ eq2.0 ] ) on a lattice of @xmath66 sites @xmath67 here @xmath68 is the @xmath69 matrix representation for the operator @xmath70 .",
    "it is tridiagonal .",
    "the method used in this paper to calculate the idos for the above equation is the decimation technique of lambert and weaire @xcite .",
    "this method is based on a renormalization philosophy , where successive degrees of freedom are eliminated from the system , see refs .",
    "@xcite for more details . after removing the sites corresponding to @xmath71",
    "the system becomes  @xcite @xmath72 with @xmath73 where the denominator is given by @xmath74    at the very heart of the method lies the fact that renormalized system is equivalent to the original one in the sense that the two systems have the same eigenvalues . by repeating this procedure all degrees of freedom",
    "can be eliminated .",
    "the number of eigenmodes less then @xmath0 , i.e. the idos , can now be shown to be equal to the number of negative denominators in the sequence @xmath75",
    "we would like to point out that this algorithm is very efficient .",
    "in order to test the conjecture  ( [ eq3.3a_whole ] ) , and thus also eqs .",
    "( [ eq3.3b_whole ] ) to ( [ eq3.3d_whole ] ) , we have calculated the idos for various system sizes , @xmath35 , fixing the hurst exponent @xmath29 to the value @xmath76 .",
    "we work in length units where @xmath77 .",
    "thus , the system size @xmath78 corresponds to a string of unit length ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "we set @xmath80 and @xmath81 for the cases where @xmath40 , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 for the cases where @xmath84 .",
    "likewise , we set @xmath85 and @xmath86 for the cases where @xmath63 , and @xmath87 and @xmath88 for the cases where @xmath89 .",
    "we averaged over 500 samples in case ( 1 ) , while we used 50 samples in the three other cases .",
    "as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig1]a the idos is a linear function of the frequency @xmath0 , and @xmath90 increases with system size @xmath35 .",
    "this is consistent with the predictions of eq .",
    "( [ eq3.3 ] ) . a similar linear behavior has been found for case ( 2 ) to ( 4 ) , but these results are not shown explicitly .",
    "we test in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b the case ( 1 ) scaling relation ( [ eq3.3 ] ) , in fig .  [ fig2 ] the case ( 2 ) scaling relation ( [ eq3.3b ] ) , in fig .  [ fig3]a the case ( 3 ) scaling relation ( [ eq3.3d ] ) , and in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the case ( 4 ) scaling relation ( [ eq3.3b ] ) .    in all cases",
    "_ except _ case ( 3 ) , our numerical data are consistent with the theoretical predictions . in case ( 3 ) , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 , data collapse was obtained by scaling @xmath91 ( see fig .  [",
    "this is very different from the predicted behavior , eq .",
    "( [ eq3.3d ] ) .",
    "we do not know the reason for this discrepancy between theory and numerical result .",
    "we have investigated the idos for a self - affine string , i.e.  a string with self - affine variations in mass density and elastic coefficient .",
    "there are four relevant cases to study depending on whether the self - affine variations dominate or not in the mass density and elastic coefficient .",
    "we have compared numerical studies with a conjecture based on assuming that a result of lapidus and fleckinger @xcite is valid for the self - affine string .",
