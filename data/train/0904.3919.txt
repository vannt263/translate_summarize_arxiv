    ", an electric field @xmath100 applied to the bulk of the sample ( the @xmath101-direction is chosen arbitrarily ) will produce a quantized current @xmath102 in the direction perpendicular to it .",

    "here i briefly review the general theory for this phenomenon , which is known as the anomalous hall effect.@xcite it states that the hall conductivity @xmath103 may be non - zero , even in the absence of a net magnetic flux through the sample , provided time - reversal invariance is still broken .",
    "furthermore it is quantized in units of @xmath104 and can be written in terms of a set of integer topological invariants as @xmath105.@xcite here @xmath26 is the discrete index that labels the energy bands and the sum ranges over all occupied bands .",
    "( the theory assumes that the fermi energy is in a gap between bands so that there are no partially filled bands . )",

    "furthermore , there is a sum - rule relating the chern numbers before and after a band - touching .",
    "suppose that , by varying a parameter in the hamiltonian , one induces bands @xmath26 and @xmath108 to touch before moving apart again .",
    "let @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) be the chern numbers before ( after ) the bands touched .",

    "if bands @xmath26 and @xmath108 are both occupied , @xmath103 stays constant although @xmath106 and @xmath112 change .",
    "thus @xmath103 only changes if the fermi energy lies in the gap between bands @xmath26 and @xmath108 .    in order to calculate the change in chern numbers , one only needs information about the bands that touch and only in regions of the brillouin zone that are close to the points where the bands touch.@xcite this information may be obtained by means of a perturbative expansion in the wave vector @xmath75 and the external parameter that controls the closing of the gap .",
    "( the general procedure is the same as was used in sec .",
    "[ near_zero ] of this text . )",
    "if the first order coefficients do not vanish , the touching point is characterized by a dirac fermion .",
    "its effective @xmath85 hamiltonian is brought into a standard form ( essentially the valley - isotropic representation ) by means of appropriate @xmath85 unitary transforms .",
    "it turns out that the change in chern numbers is completely determined by the sign of the mass term in this representation .",
    "if the bands touch at several points in @xmath75 space simultaneously , then each touching point gives an independent contribution .",

    "there are two contributions to the result , one from each touching point .",
    "since the same mass term appears at both touching points ( in the valley - isotropic representation ) , the contributions from the two touching points are the same .",
    "if the sign of the mass were opposite in the two valleys , as is the case for a substrate - induced mass , the two contributions would have canceled .",
    "there are two ways to change the sign of the mass term [ cf .",

    "one may either change the sign of the external potential @xmath3 , or one may change the sign of the magnetic field and hence of @xmath40 . according to the theory ,",
    "both methods give the same change in the hall conductivity , @xmath116 . the transformation",
    "@xmath117 is equivalent to time - reversal , which changes the sign of the hall conductivity : @xmath118 .",
    "therefore @xmath119 .",
    "thus , knowing the change in @xmath103 when the mass changes sign , one also knows the actual value of @xmath103 .    if @xmath120 is the hall conductivity of a sample in which the mass term has sign @xmath121 then @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , according to the above argument @xmath123",
    "suppose that the topological theory discussed in the previous section was not known .",
    "would it have been possible to show that the graphene system studied here displays a hall effect , without at the same time essentially deriving the topological theory ? as i show in this section , the answer is ` yes ' . in the process , the underlying physical mechanism that here produces the anomalous hall effect is identified .    the starting point of the argument is to consider the two zero - energy solutions @xmath124 that are obtained when @xmath33 .",
    "a key feature of these wave functions is that the sign of @xmath40 is anti - correlated with that of @xmath15 i.e. @xmath40 is negative on average where the magnetic field points in the positive @xmath125 direction and positive on average where the magnetic field points in the negative @xmath125 direction . to prove this assertion i show that the number @xmath126 is negative .",
    "the proof is elementary . from eq .",
    "( [ eq_d2f ] ) follows that @xmath127 . using integration by parts , and invoking gauss s theorem i find @xmath128 the integration in the first term is around the border of @xmath11 and @xmath129 is normal to the border ( in the @xmath130 plane ) pointing outwards and yields zero because @xmath15 is @xmath11-periodic . the result [ eq .",
    "( [ eq_p_negative ] ) ] implies that a particle in the state @xmath61 ( @xmath59 ) is largely confined to regions where @xmath131 points in the positive ( negative ) @xmath125 direction . in sec .",
    "[ two ] it was noted that the eigenstates @xmath57 , have opposite sublattice polarization .",
    "the correlation between @xmath15 and @xmath40 then implies that sublattice polarization is correlated with the sign of the magnetic field .",
    "for instance , in valley @xmath58 , regions where the magnetic field points in the negative @xmath125 direction are @xmath60 sublattice polarized while regions where the magnetic field points in the positive @xmath125 direction are @xmath15 sublattice polarized .",
    "this is consistent with the numerical results presented in figure 3 of ref . .",
    "there it was pointed out that the state @xmath61 closely resembles a state in the zero landau level of a graphene sample with a constant magnetic field that points in the positive @xmath125 direction .",
    "this would have explained the existence of a hall effect , were it not for the state @xmath59 that also belongs to the zero eigenspace .",
    "this state is similar to a zero landau level state in a magnetic field pointing in the negative @xmath125 direction , and it is responsible for a hall effect that cancels that of @xmath61 .    in order to have a hall effect a perturbation that lifts the degeneracy between @xmath59 and @xmath61 is needed .",
    "this is the role of the electrostatic potential @xmath3 .",
    "if the sign of @xmath3 is anti - correlated with that of @xmath15 it will raise the energy of the state @xmath59 while lowering the energy of the state @xmath61 .",
    "this leads to a gap with associated positive mass .",
    "a scalar potential @xmath3 whose spatial profile is correlated with that of @xmath15 will do the opposite and leads to gap associated with a negative mass .    turning to the expression [ eq .",
    "( [ eq_u ] ] for the @xmath132 valence band bloch states @xmath133 , one sees that the dominant term in the linear combination is proportional to @xmath134 . as a result",

    "this is consistent with the response of @xmath57 to @xmath3 discussed above .",
    "one thus arrives at the fundamental result that there is a finite positive ( negative ) magnetic flux through the region of space occupied valence band electrons when the mass is positive ( negative ) .",
    "the valence band will then experience a ` usual ' hall effect .",
    "an electric field @xmath135 will , through the lorentz force , lead to a current in the direction @xmath136 .",
    "electrons in the conduction band would have seen an opposite magnetic field and produced an opposite hall effect . however , the fermi energy is in the gap between the two bands so that no conduction band states are occupied .",
    "the sign obtained here for the hall current agrees with the result derived from the topological theory [ cf . eq .",
    "( [ eq_hall ] ) ] .",
    "so far i have said nothing about the quantization of the hall current .",
    "indeed , the above argument does not prove that the anomalous hall conductivity precisely equals @xmath137 .",
    "it only indicates that @xmath103 is finite and predicts its sign .",
    "however , the argument does relate the anomalous hall effect in graphene with periodic electromagnetic fields to the usual integer hall effect in a constant magnetic field .",
    "it thus shows that the quantization of @xmath103 has the same origin in both cases .    finally , a word on the nanotube system : the hall effect found there@xcite is not produced by states localized where the magnetic field has a well - defined direction , although such states are of course also present in that system .",
    "rather it is produced by higher energy states that are localized where the magnetic changes sign .",
    "thus , a different mechanism is responsible for the effect reported in ref . .",
    "other features also distinguish it from the hall effect considered in the present work : it is not accompanied by a gap between the conduction and valence bands .",
    "it is associated with two sets of states on opposite sides of the circumference of the nanotube that carry current along the length of the nanotube but in opposite directions .",
    "the quantization is approximate .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the following properties of hall effect discussed in the present work .",
    "it appears when the fermi energy is in the gap between the conduction and valence bands .",
    "all the current travels in one direction throughout the whole sample .",
    "the hall quantization of the hall conductivity is sharp .",
    "the conclusion is that the hall effect discussed in this paper has not yet been found in the context of carbon nanotubes .",
    "but is it there ?",
    "the topological theory can not answer this question .",
    "it only works for systems that are much larger than the periodicity of the magnetic field , whereas the length of the nanotube system in the circumferential direction is the same as the periodicity of the magnetic field .",
    "it is not clear if the intuitive argument presented in this section can be applied either .",

    "<S> when smooth , zero - on - average , periodic magnetic and electric fields are applied to a carbon mono - layer ( graphene ) , a gap between the valence and conduction band is introduced . here </S>",
    "<S> this gapped state is studied analytically . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that it does not correspond to a band insulator : a constant electric field induces a quantized hall current even though the magnetic flux through the sample is zero and there are no landau levels . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenon is of the same type as that discovered by haldane for a graphene sample in a periodic magnetic field that is not smooth , i.e. varies rapidly on the scale of the graphene lattice constant . </S>",
    "<S> the effect can be explained in terms of the topological theory of thouless , kohmoto , nightingale and den nijs . for the system studied in this paper , an explanation in terms of simple physical principles </S>",
    "<S> is also presented . </S>",
    "<S> thus some of the mystery is taken out of the apparently strange phenomenon of a hall effect without magnetic flux . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , haldane s model requires control over external magnetic fields on length scales less than an angstrom and is therefore hard to realize experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> for the model studied here , control over external fields on length scales that are larger by two orders of magnitude or more is sufficient . </S>",
    "<S> the model is therefore more amenable to experimental realization .    </S>",
    "<S> the filled conduction band and the empty valence band of a carbon mono - layer ( graphene ) touch at two inequivalent points in the brillouin zone.@xcite regions of the brillouin zone in the vicinity of these points are called valleys . in each of the two valleys , </S>",
    "<S> low energy excitations are described by a two - dimensional massless dirac equation . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> electrons in graphene can propagate through electrostatic potential barriers . in the jargon of relativistic quantum mechanics , </S>",
    "<S> this is known as klein tunneling.@xcite when a gap is induced between the valence and conduction band , klein tunneling is suppressed and the electronic properties of graphene change radically . </S>",
    "<S> several distinct situations have been uncovered :    recently a method for producing a band insulating state was demonstrated experimentally.@xcite it involves growing the graphene sample on an appropriate substrate that induces a potential energy difference between the two triangular sublattices that constitute the sample s honeycomb lattice . in a seminal paper by haldane,@xcite </S>",
    "<S> it was demonstrated that graphene s honeycomb lattice also supports a fundamentally different kind of gapped state which i will call anomalous . a signature of the anomalous state is a hall effect without landau levels and in a zero average magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting hall conductivity is a topological invariant.@xcite    in haldane s model , the anomalous state is realized by the combined effect of next nearest neighbor hopping together with a magnetic field that has the same periodicity as the honeycomb lattice and zero flux through a lattice unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> because of the very short length scales ( @xmath0 ) on which this magnetic field must be controlled , the experimental realization of haldane s model does not seem feasible . </S>",
    "<S> recently , kane and mele @xcite pointed out that the spin orbit interaction can generate an anomalous gapped state in graphene without the need for any external magnetic field . in this case , since time - reversal symmetry is not broken , no hall effect with electric charge current is produced . </S>",
    "<S> rather a spin - hall effect occurs . </S>",
    "<S> however , the effect may be hard to observe because of the smallness of the spin orbit interaction in graphene .    </S>",
    "<S> a gapped state can also occur when periodic magnetic and electric fields that are smooth on the scale of the graphene lattice constant are applied jointly to a graphene sample . </S>",
    "<S> since these fields have a periodicity @xmath1 , experimental realization is more feasible than in the case of haldane s model . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> i show analytically that the resulting gapped state is of the same anomalous type as in haldane s model . apart from being experimentally relevant , </S>",
    "<S> the system studied here has another interesting feature . </S>",
    "<S> its hall effect can be explained without recourse to the topological theory . because of this it is possible in the present instance to identify a physical mechanism responsible for the hall effect . </S>",
    "<S> this hopefully takes some of the mystery out of the general but abstract topological theory.@xcite    a gapped graphene state that results from smoothly varying fields was first revealed in the numerical study of ref . </S>",
    "<S> ( see figure 2 , last frame , of that work ) and is also mentioned in ref . . </S>",
    "<S> the effective magnetic field studied in these references is produced by lattice deformations . </S>",
    "<S> the single - valley physics of such a field is identical to that of a real magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical results for a single valley that is presented here confirm and explain numerical results obtained in refs . and . </S>",
    "<S> a caveat is warranted though : despite the close similarity between a graphene system with a real magnetic field and one with a deformed lattice , there is a fundamental difference . </S>",
    "<S> the gapped state produced by deformations is not anomalous . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that for deformation induced fields , the anomalous behavior of the two valleys cancel each other , while for real magnetic fields , the behavior is the same in both valleys and there is no cancellation .    </S>",
    "<S> several other publications deal with systems similar to that studied here . in refs . and the two - dimensional non - relativistic schrdinger equation with a periodic magnetic field that is zero on average was studied . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to compare this system to the graphene system in the limit of strong magnetic fields , when the magnetic length is much smaller than the periodicity of the fields . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous hall effect@xcite was found to disappear in the case of the schrdinger equation.@xcite it remains present in graphene as is shown here . </S>",
    "<S> another relevant study@xcite dealt with graphene in a periodic electric field alone . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that a strong electric field can induce additional touching points between graphene s valence and conduction bands . in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> only the case of weak electric fields will be considered , so that additional touching points do not arise . </S>",
    "<S> what happens when both the electric and magnetic fields are strong , or when the electric field is strong but the magnetic field weak , is a topic for further investigation .    </S>",
    "<S> there are also at least two relevant works in the carbon nanotube literature . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> the low energy spectrum of a carbon nanotube in a magnetic field that is transverse to the axial direction is calculated analytically . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> the same system is considered and shown to support a quantized hall current in the axial direction . </S>",
    "<S> the nanotube system can be considered a special one - dimensional case of the general two dimensional system considered below . in order to induce a gap in the nanotube spectrum </S>",
    "<S> , an electric field must be applied parallel to the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this was not considered in the cited references . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the hall effect found in ref . </S>",
    "<S> is fundamentally different from the hall effect considered here . </S>",
    "<S> this will be discussed in more detail below . </S>",
    "<S> however some results that hold for the system discussed in this work should also hold for the nanotube system . where there should be agreement between results in this paper and in the nanotube studies , </S>",
    "<S> agreement is found .    </S>",
    "<S> the plan of the paper is as follows : in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ one ] the system to be studied is defined mathematically . in sec . [ two ] its zero energy eigenstates are found when the electric field is zero , in which case there is no gap . in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ near_zero ] the low energy description of the gapped state is developed . in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ four ] the topological theory of the anomalous hall effect is briefly reviewed and then applied to the graphene system in order to calculate the quantized hall conductivity . in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ five ] the anomalous hall effect is considered again , this time without invoking the topological theory . in sec . [ six ] an example is presented in order to illustrate the general results of the previous sections . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions are presented in sec . </S>",
