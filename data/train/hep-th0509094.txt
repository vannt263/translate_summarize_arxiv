    "the skyrme model is a classical model of the strong interaction between atomic nuclei @xcite . in order to compare the skyrme model with nuclear physics",
    "we have to understand the classical solutions and then quantize the model .",
    "the classical solutions have a surprisingly rich structure .",
    "configurations in the skyrme model are labelled by a topological winding number which can be interpreted as the baryon number @xmath0 .",
    "static minimal energy configurations for a given @xmath0 are known as skyrmions .",
    "the @xmath1 skyrmion has spherical symmetry , the @xmath2 skyrmion has axial symmetry and for @xmath3 skyrmions have various discrete symmetries , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the skyrme model depends on a parameter which corresponds to the pion mass @xmath4 . for @xmath5",
    "all the skyrmions for @xmath6 were found to be shell - like configurations with discrete symmetries @xcite .",
    "such configurations are very well described by the rational map ansatz @xcite . however ,",
    "if the value of the pion mass is increased to its physical value or higher , then for high enough baryon number shell - like solutions are no longer the minimal energy solutions @xcite .    in @xcite adkins et al .",
    "quantized the translational and rotational zero modes of the @xmath1 skyrmion for zero and nonzero pion mass respectively and obtained good agreement with experiment .",
    "a subtle point is that skyrmions can be quantized as fermions as has been shown in @xcite .",
    "solitons in scalar field theories can consistently be quantized as fermions provided that the fundamental group of configuration space has a @xmath7 subgroup generated by a loop in which two identical solitons are exchanged .",
    "all loops in configuration space give rise to so - called finkelstein - rubinstein constraints which depend on whether a loop in configuration space is contractible or not .",
    "in particular , symmetries of classical configurations induce loops in configurations space .",
    "after quantization , these loops give rise to constraints on the wave function .",
    "the @xmath2 skyrmion with axial symmetry was quantized in @xcite using the zero mode quantization .",
    "later , the approximation was improved by taking massive modes into account @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 skyrmion was first quantized in @xcite and the @xmath9 skyrmion @xcite .",
    "irwin performed a zero mode quantization for @xmath10 @xcite using the monopole moduli space as an approximation for the skyrmion moduli space .",
    "the physical predictions of the skyrme model for various baryon numbers were also discussed in @xcite .",
    "recently , the finkelstein - rubinstein constraints have been calculated for skyrmions which are well - approximated by the rational map ansatz @xcite , and which we shall call rational map skyrmions . in this case , the finkelstein - rubinstein constraints are given by a simple formula .",
    "this formula is also valid if the skyrme configuration can be deformed into a rational map skyrmion while preserving the relevant symmetries .",
    "however , this is not always possible .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show how to calculate finkelstein - rubinstein constraints for more general configurations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ rationalmaps ]",
    "we first describe the rational map ansatz .",
    "then we discuss the finkelstein - rubinstein constraints . finally , we derive some constraints on the symmetries which are compatible with a rational map skyrmion . in section [ truncated ]",
    "we first introduce a truncated rational map ansatz which describes well - separated rational map skyrmions .",
    "then we calculate the finkelstein - rubinstein constraints for this class of skyrme configurations . in the following section ,",
    "we describe how to calculate the finkelstein - rubinstein constraints for a minimal energy configuration which is only known numerically .",
    "we also give an example . in section [ evenb ]",
    "we derive constraints on possible symmetries in order to make predictions about ground states for skyrmions with even baryon number .",
    "we end with a conclusion .",
    "in this section , we first recall the some basic facts about the skyrme model . then we describe the rational map ansatz .",
    "we then discuss how to quantize a skyrmion as a fermion .",
    "finally , we derive which symmetries are compatible with a rational map skyrmion of a given baryon number .",
    "the skyrme model is a classical field theory of pions .",
    "the basic field is the @xmath11 valued field @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "the static solutions can be obtained by varying the following energy @xmath14[r_i , r_j ] )   - m^2 { \\rm tr } ( u-1 ) \\right ) d^3 x,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is a right invariant @xmath16 valued current , and @xmath17 is a parameter proportional to the pion mass @xmath4 , @xcite . in order to have finite energy , skyrme fields have to take a constant value , @xmath18 , at infinity , and such maps",
    "are characterized by an integer - valued winding number .",
    "this topological charge is interpreted as the baryon number and is given by the following integral @xmath19 we will denote the configuration space of skyrmions by @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath20 splits into connected components @xmath21 labelled by the topological charge .",
    "furthermore , the energy of configurations in @xmath21 is bounded below by @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the minimal energy solutions have been calculated in the massless case , @xmath23 , for all @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the solutions are shell - like structures which are very well approximated by the rational map ansatz @xcite which we will now describe .",
    "the main idea is to write skyrme fields which can be thought of as maps from @xmath24 in terms of rational maps which are holomorphic maps from @xmath25 . in algebraic topology",
    ", such a construction is known as a suspension .",
    "first , we introduce polar coordinates @xmath26 and note that the angular coordinates can be related to the complex plane @xmath27 by the stereographic projection @xmath28 .",
    "then the skyrme field can be written as @xmath29 where the profile function @xmath30 is a real function satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the map @xmath33 is the eponymous rational map .",
    "it can be written as the quotient of two polynomials @xmath34 and @xmath35 which satisfy @xmath36 and @xmath34 and @xmath35 have no common factors . here",
    "@xmath37 denotes the polynomial degree .",
    "the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) can be inserted into the energy ( [ energy ] ) and we obtain @xmath38 where @xmath39 to minimize the energy ( [ ratenergy ] ) one first determines the rational map which minimizes @xmath40 and then calculates the shape function @xmath30 numerically by solving the corresponding euler - lagrange equation .",
    "the rational maps which minimize @xmath40 have been determined numerically in @xcite for all @xmath41 .",
    "note that the restriction that @xmath42 is a holomorphic map can be lifted and a generalized rational map ansatz can be introduced @xcite .",
    "this generalized ansatz has been shown to improve the energy significantly for @xmath43 , and it also captures the singularity structure of skyrmions better . however , it is difficult to use for higher baryon number , and from the point of view of discussing symmetries the original rational map ansatz is sufficient .",
    "the rational map ansatz gives a good approximation to the energy of a skyrmion and also gives a very accurate prediction of its symmetry @xcite .",
    "by symmetry we mean that a rotation in space followed by a rotation in target space leaves the skyrmion invariant .",
    "namely , @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are @xmath11 matrices and @xmath47 is the associated @xmath48 rotation .",
    "it is therefore important to understand how a rational map transforms under rotations in space and target space .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are mbius transformations .",
    "see @xcite for further details .      in the following , we recall the ideas of finkelstein and rubinstein @xcite on how to quantized a scalar field theory and obtain fermions .",
    "for further details see @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to define a wave function on the covering space of configuration space .",
    "recall that the configuration space @xmath20 of the skyrme model splits into connected components labelled by the degree @xmath0 , and will be denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "the fundamental group of each component of the configuration space @xmath20 is @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , the covering space @xmath53 of each component is a double cover . in order to have fermionic quantisation we have to impose the condition that if two different points @xmath54 correspond to the same point @xmath55 then the wave function @xmath56 has to satisfy @xmath57 the points @xmath54 can be interpreted as two paths in configuration space .",
    "the condition that @xmath58 implies that @xmath59 and @xmath60 differ by a noncontractible loop .",
    "every symmetry of a classical configuration gives rise to a loop in configuration space .",
    "in particular , we are interested in symmetries given by a rotation by @xmath61 in space followed by a rotation by @xmath62 in target space .",
    "this leads to the following constraint on the wave function @xmath63 : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the direction of the rotation axis in space , @xmath66 is the rotation axis in target space , a @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the angular momentum operators in space and target space , respectively .",
    "note that rotations in target space will also be called isorotations .",
    "the finkelstein - rubinstein phase @xmath69 enforces the condition ( [ fermionic ] ) and satisfies @xmath70 here is a good place to summarize some important and well - known results .",
    "giulini showed that a @xmath71 rotation of a skyrmion gives rise to @xmath72 if and only if the baryon number @xmath0 is odd , @xcite . finkelstein and",
    "rubinstein showed in @xcite that a @xmath71 rotation of a skyrmion of degree @xmath0 is homotopic to an exchange of two skyrmions of degree @xmath0 .",
    "this also implies that an exchange of two identical skyrmions gives rise to @xmath72 if and only if their baryon number @xmath0 is odd . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that a @xmath71 isorotation of a skyrmion also gives rise to @xmath72 if and only if the baryon number @xmath0 is odd .",
    "these results agree with the physical intuition since atomic nuclei can be modelled by interacting point - like fermionic particles .",
    "shell - like skyrmions are described very well using the rational map ansatz .",
    "if a rational map skyrmion of degree @xmath0 is symmetric under a rotation by @xmath61 followed by an isorotation by @xmath62 then the finkelstein - rubinstein phase of this symmetry is given by @xmath73 which has been proven in @xcite .",
    "for @xmath3 all the known skyrmions are invariant under discrete subgroups , so they contain cyclic groups as subgroups .",
    "let @xmath74 be a cyclic group of order @xmath75 which is generated by a rotation by @xmath76 followed by an isorotation by @xmath77 where @xmath78 . equation ( [ n ] ) imposes a constraint on the values of @xmath0 which are compatible with a given @xmath74 symmetry .",
    "namely , @xmath79 has to be an integer .",
    "a stronger constraint can be derived if we work directly with rational maps .",
    "a rational map of degree @xmath0 can have a @xmath74 symmetry if and only if @xmath80 or @xmath81 .",
    "* proof : * + without loss of generality consider rational maps with boundary condition @xmath82 and assume that the @xmath74 symmetry corresponds to a rotation around the third axis in space followed by a rotation around the negative third axis in target space . with this choice of axes ,",
    "the boundary conditions are preserved by the relevant rotation and also by the relevant isorotation , and the sign choice corresponds to the sign choice for ( [ n ] ) in @xcite .",
    "the rational map @xmath83 can be written as @xmath84 where the polynomials @xmath34 and @xmath35 have no common factors .",
    "the @xmath74 symmetry condition is given by @xmath85 note that a @xmath86 rotation can be interpreted as a @xmath87 rotation followed by a @xmath71 isorotation . since for a @xmath71 isorotation the finkelstein - rubinstein phase is simply given by @xmath88 , we can restrict our attention to @xmath89 .",
    "first we show existence .",
    "let @xmath81 , so @xmath90 .",
    "then the rational map @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a polynomial of degree @xmath93 and @xmath94 is a polynomial of at most degree @xmath93 .",
    "for @xmath95 the degree of @xmath94 has to be less than @xmath93 in order to respect the boundary conditions @xmath96 .",
    "this rational map is invariant under @xmath74 . to make sure that it is a rational map of degree @xmath97 the polynomials @xmath98 and @xmath99",
    "are required not to have any common factors .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath100 , we need to impose @xmath101 , since the polynomial @xmath34 has a zero at @xmath102 . for @xmath95",
    ", we also impose the condition @xmath101 , and we will discuss the case @xmath103 in the next paragraph .",
    "the simplest example of such a rational map is @xmath104 hence a rational map of degree @xmath0 with @xmath74 symmetry exists for @xmath105 .",
    "similarly , let @xmath80 , so @xmath106 .",
    "again , we only consider @xmath107",
    ". then the rational map @xmath108 is invariant under @xmath74 . here",
    "@xmath92 is again a polynomial of degree @xmath93 and @xmath94 is a polynomial of at most degree @xmath109 which has no common factors with @xmath92 .",
    "furthermore , we also require @xmath110 .",
    "one example of such a rational map is @xmath111 hence a rational map of degree @xmath0 with @xmath74 symmetry exists for @xmath112 .",
    "this completes the proof of existence . the classification of rational maps into type ( [ rat1 ] ) and type ( [ rat2 ] ) will become useful in section [ evenb ] .",
    "now , we assume that the rational map ( [ rat ] ) is invariant under @xmath74 .",
    "in homogeneous coordinates , the rational map @xmath42 is given by @xmath113 \\in { \\mathbb c}p^1 $ ] subject to the relation that @xmath113 = [ \\lambda p(z ) ,   \\lambda q(z)]$ ] for any complex number @xmath114 . under the symmetry",
    "@xmath74 , the polynomials @xmath34 and @xmath35 in equation ( [ rat ] ) transform as @xmath115 for @xmath116 . assuming the rational map is invariant under @xmath74 leads to the following constraints on the coefficients .",
    "@xmath117 in order to have a rational map of degree @xmath0 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 can not have any common factors .",
    "this implies that @xmath118 and @xmath119 can not both be zero .",
    "first , assume @xmath120",
    ". then equation ( [ constraint ] ) implies that @xmath121 the coefficient of the highest power in the numerator is also not allowed to vanish which implies @xmath122 so that @xmath80 .",

    "therefore , @xmath125 so that @xmath81 , which completes the proof . @xmath126",
    "the lemma is more restrictive than the condition that @xmath79 is an integer .",
    "for example @xmath127 suggests that a @xmath128 symmetry is possible for @xmath2 .",
    "however , since @xmath129 our lemma excludes such a symmetry .",
    "in @xcite the finkelstein - rubinstein constraints were calculated for skyrmions which are well approximated by the rational map ansatz . in this section ,",
    "we calculate the finkelstein - rubinstein constraints for skyrme configurations @xmath130 which are given by a truncated rational map ansatz defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath131 be a skyrme configuration of degree @xmath132 which is given by ( [ ansatz ] ) and the shape function @xmath30 is a smooth , decreasing function which satisfies @xmath31 and @xmath133 for @xmath134 .",
    "then the skyrme configuration is given by @xmath135 from formula ( [ b ] ) it is obvious that the configuration @xmath130 has the degree @xmath136 .",

    "such an ansatz provides reasonable initial conditions for numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "a related ansatz is the product ansatz .",
    "this ansatz produces skyrme configurations which are closer in energy to the true solutions .",
    "topologically , these two anstze are equivalent . however , the product ansatz has the disadvantage that it is non - commutative , since in general @xmath140 for @xmath11 matrices @xmath141 and @xmath142 , so that it is slightly more difficult to discuss symmetries .",
    "therefore , we restrict our attention to the truncated rational map ansatz .    consider a configuration @xmath130 which is invariant under @xmath74 .",
    "the symmetry relates different skyrmions @xmath143 with each other . for each individual skyrmion @xmath143",
    "there are two possibilities .",
    "either the centre of this skyrmion lies on the symmetry axis or it is one constituent of a regular @xmath75-gon of skyrmions which transform into each other under the symmetry .",

    "the main idea is to construct multiple concentric shells of skyrmions , where each shell is given by the usual rational map ansatz .",

    ", experiment shows that the ground state is generally given by @xmath261 .",
    "this is only possible if the finkelstein - rubinstein constraints are trivial .",
    "the above discussion showed that the @xmath262 ground state is allowed for @xmath247 , in agreement with experiment . in this calculation",
    "we assumed that the relevant skyrmions are well - approximated by rational maps , and that @xmath197 symmetry only occurs as a subgroup of a @xmath246 symmetry ( which might itself be a subgroup of an octahedral symmetry ) .    for higher pion mass",
    "the configurations deviate significantly from the rational map ansatz @xcite , which raises the question whether it is possible to classify symmetries allowing for the more general truncated rational map ansatz .",
    "the skyrmions would be allowed to split into groups and the finkelstein - rubinstein constraints have to be calculated with formula ( [ generaln ] ) .",
    "note that if skyrmions can be thought of as being composed only of @xmath9 skyrmions ( @xmath61 particles ) then formula ( [ generaln ] ) and the above symmetry discussion also imply that there are no negative finkelstein - rubinstein phases , so that the ground state for such skyrmions is @xmath261 .    for odd - odd nuclei , which implies @xmath129 for equal number of protons and neutrons",
    ", experiment shows that the ground state is usually not given by @xmath262 .",
    "this is consistent with our observation that negative finkelstein - rubinstein phases occur .",
    "however , symmetry arguments alone are not sufficient to prove the occurrence of negative finkelstein - rubinstein phases . for odd baryon number , lemma [ beven ] can not be applied and there is little hope of finding simple rules .",
    "in this paper we discussed how to calculate finkelstein - rubinstein constraints for configurations which are only known numerically .",
    "this is an important problem since recent calculations show that for large pion mass skyrmions are not very well described by rational maps @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is mounting evidence that the pion mass in the skyrme model should be interpreted as an effective mass with a value at least twice the physical value @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the finkelstein - rubinstein constraints can be incorporated into the algorithm for finding the minimal energy configurations with only minor modifications .",
    "note that for a wide range of values of the pion mass , the rational map ansatz works well for small enough baryon number @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the truncated rational map ansatz in its current form has a good chance of capturing all the physically relevant skyrmions .",
    "an obvious but slightly tedious generalisation would be to allow for the constituent skyrmions to be themselves approximated by a truncated rational map ansatz .",
    "the paper also discussed which symmetries occur for rational map skyrmions and when to expect negative finkelstein - rubinstein constraints for even baryon numbers .",
    "in particular , the skyrme model calculations suggest the correct phenomenological trend , namely that the ground state of even - even nuclei have the ground state @xmath263 .",
