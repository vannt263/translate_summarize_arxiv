    "there are three possible contributions to the  decay amplitude : 1 ) direct cp - violating contribution from electroweak penguin and w - box diagrams , 2 ) indirect cp - violating amplitude from the @xmath4 component in @xmath5 , and 3 ) cp - conserving amplitude from the @xmath6 intermediate state @xcite .",
    "the sizes of the three contributions depend on whether the final - state lepton is an electron or a muon .",
    "the cp - conserving two - photon contribution to the electron mode is expected to be @xmath7 , based on @xmath8 data .",
    "although suppressed in phase space , this contribution to the muon mode is comparable to the electron mode because of the scalar form factor which is proportional to lepton mass@xcite .",
    "the interesting direct cp - violating component must be extracted from any signal found for @xmath9 in the presence of two formidable obstacles : the theoretical uncertainty on contamination from indirect cp - violating and cp - conserving contributions , and the experimental background from @xmath10 @xcite .    to subtract the indirect cp and cp conserving contributions ,",
    "several authors have examined the use of measurements from @xmath11 , @xmath12 , as well as the lepton energy asymmetry@xcite . with better measurements expected in the near future ,",
    "it is useful to reexamine decays @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we examine if the muon decay asymmetries give additional constraints on cp violation in .",
    "indeed , we find that within the standard model the p - odd longitudinal polarization of the muon is non - zero only if the direct cp violating amplitudes are non - zero .",
    "we also find that other asymmetries that involve the polarization of both muons can be constructed to isolate the direct and indirect contributions to cp violation",
    ". we will proceed in analogy to the charged version of the decay , @xmath13 which has been analyzed extensively@xcite@xmath14@xcite .",
    "the structure of @xmath15 decays is more complex than that of @xmath16 decays because of cp suppression .",
    "in particular , the one - photon intermediate state contribution to the vector form factor ( @xmath17 ) , which is expected to be almost real and dominant for  decays , is cp - suppressed in  decays .",
    "the decay process can have contributions from scalar , vector , pseudo - scalar and axial - vector interactions , with corresponding form factors , @xmath18 , @xmath17 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20@xcite : @xmath21 here @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the kaon , pion , lepton , and antilepton 4-momenta .",
    "transverse muon polarization effects arise from interference between terms with non - zero phase differences , while longitudinal polarization results from interference between terms with the same phase .    the scalar form factor , @xmath18 ,",
    "is expected to get a contribution from only the two - photon intermediate state , @xmath26 .",
    "pseudo - scalar , @xmath19 , and axial - vector , @xmath20 , get contributions from the short - distance `` z - penguin '' and `` w - box '' diagrams only , where the dominant term arises from t - quark exchange ; both form factors therefore depend on @xmath27 , with a small contribution from the charm quark .",

    "unlike @xmath34 , all the amplitudes in the @xmath5 decay are likely to be of the same order of magnitude , and polarization effects should therefore be large ( @xmath35 ) , unless there are strong cancellations @xcite .",
    "the symmetries of the decay are clearest in the @xmath36 cm frame . in this reference frame ,",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 are the helicities of the lepton and anti - lepton , respectively . using this notation , the helicity amplitudes , @xmath39 , in terms of the four form factors @xmath40 are : @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 are the momentum , energy and the mass of the negative lepton , and @xmath45 is the angle between the negative lepton and the kaon in the @xmath46 cm frame .",
    "@xmath47 can depend on various invariants like @xmath48 but we single out the unit vector @xmath49 because it changes under the @xmath50-operation . under @xmath50 @xmath51 . as we have already discussed , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "in this set of graphs the form factors have no @xmath45 dependence other than an explicit factor of @xmath54 in @xmath29 .",
    "these helicity amplitudes can be used to create interesting cp - odd observables such as the following three : @xmath55 the difference between the last two asymmetries isolates the interference between the @xmath56 part of @xmath17 and purely direct cp violating amplitudes .",
    "the above asymmetries involve the measurement of the polarization of both leptons in the same event .",
    "it is possible to get direct information about cp violating amplitudes from measuring asymmetries for one of the leptons only , even though the asymmetry is not intrinsically cp - viloating .",
    "it is well - known@xcite that the out - of - plane polarization of the muon , transverse to the plane formed by the @xmath57 and the lepton momenta , gets contributions from cp - violating amplitudes , but several effects are mixed up and it is not possible to give a separation of the direct and the indirect pieces .",
