    "the nonlinear dynamics of electrons in carbon nanotubes ( cns ) under the action of an external electric field has been the subject of intense research @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite and bezryadin _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have measured the current - voltage characteristics for single - wall cns at low temperatures , i.e when @xmath0 , @xmath1 . where @xmath2 is boltzmann constant , @xmath3 is the temperature , @xmath4 is the charging energy .",
    "the energy level spacing @xmath1 is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the fermi velocity and l is the carbon nanotube length @xcite . at this",
    "low temperatures the current is produced by the electrons tunneling through the cns in the presence of the coulomb blockade induced by long - range coulomb interactions @xcite .",
    "nonlinear coherent transport through doped nanotube junctions was considered in ref . @xcite and it also showed the possibility of negative differential conductivity ( ndc ) for tunelling electrons . using semiclassical boltzmann s equation , maksimenko _",
    "et al._l @xcite found that the dc current- voltage characteristics of cns biased by a constant electric field along the axis of undoped cnts at room temperatures ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) showed ndc up to frequencies on the order of the bloch frequency . here the current density is produced by conduction electrons with energies below the energy of the interband transitions and move in the crystalline field like free quasiparticles , with a modified dispersion law allowing the use of quasiclassical approach to describe the electron motion .",
    "bloch oscillations have been observed in semiconductor superlattices @xcite .",
    "these bloch oscillations are caused by bragg reflection of electrons at the edges of the brillouin regions and the occurrence of bloch oscillations are concluded from the observation of ndc .",
    "like maksimenko _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , quantum phenomena like interband transitions , quantum mechanical corrections to intraband motion as well as coulomb interactions will be excluded from this report .",
    "our report will be quasiclassical with an extension to the high - frequency electric field in cns by following the approach of ktitorov _ et al .",
    "following @xcite , the high - frequency differential conductivity is derived starting with the boltzmann kinetic equation with @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we shall ignore the difference between the energy - momentum relaxation rates and assume a common relaxation time @xmath9 for both processes .",
    "the equations of the symmetric @xmath10 and antisymmetric @xmath11 parts of the distribution functions are @xmath12 @xmath13 writing the distribution functions in fourier series as @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the electron charge , @xmath18 is the equilibrium distribution function , @xmath19 is the dirac delta function , @xmath20 is summation over the stark component , @xmath21 is the coefficient of the fourier series and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the factors by which the fourier transform of the symmetric @xmath24 and antisymmetric @xmath25 parts of the distribution functions are different from the equilibrium distribution function @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the relaxation time . the electric field @xmath28 is applied along cns axis .",
    "the equilibrium distribution function can be expanded in the analogous series with the coefficients @xmath29 expressed as @xmath30    the investigation is done within the semiclassical approximation in which conduction electrons with energy below the energy of the interband transitions move in the crystalline lattice like free quasi - particles with dispersion law extracted from quantum theory @xcite . taking into account the hexagonal crystalline structure of a rolled graphene in a form of cnt and using the tight binding approximation , the energy dispersion for zigzag and armchair cnts for which the fermi energy @xmath31 , are expressed as in eqns and , respectively @xcite @xmath32^{1/2}\\label{eq : seven}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath33^{1/2}\\label{eq : eight}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 ev is the overlapping integral , @xmath35 is the axial component of quasi - momentum , @xmath36 is transverse quasi - momentum level spacing and s is an integer .",
    "the expression for a in eqns and is given as @xmath37 , @xmath38 nm is the c - c bond length .",
    "the  and + signs correspond to the valence and conduction bands respectively . due to the transverse quantization of the quasi - momentum ,",
    "its transverse component can take n discrete values , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) . unlike transverse quasi - momentum @xmath41 ,",
    "the axial quasi momentum is assumed to vary continuously within the range @xmath42 , which corresponds to the model of infinitely long of cnt ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the quasiclassical velocity @xmath44 of an electron moving along the cnt axis is given by the expression @xmath45    substituting eqns , and into eqns and and solving with the perturbations @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , we obtain the surface current density defined by @xmath49 or @xmath50 as @xmath51 \\nonumber \\\\          & & \\times \\sum_{s=1}^n f_{rs } \\epsilon_{rs } \\label{eq : eleven}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath52    here , @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 for armchair and @xmath55 for zigzag cns .    .",
    "using quasiclassical approach , we consider an influence of bragg reflections on dynamics of an electron transport in a cns simultaneously exposed to both constant ( dc ) and ac electric fields . an analytical expression for the current density is obtained .",
    "the nonlinearity is analyzed basically on the dependence of the current density on the frequency .    in figs.[fig : one ] and [ fig : two ] , we show the plot of the real and imaginary parts of the normalized current density ( @xmath56 ) as a function of dimensionless frequency ( @xmath57 ) for a - swcnt and z - swcnt , respectively . in all two systems",
    ", we observed that @xmath58 is negative for @xmath59 which is indicative for gain at these frequencies .    in conclusion",
    ", we have large amplitude current dynamics due to bragg reflections of carbon nanotubes effect in undoped cns .",
    "we have obtained an expression for the current density - electric field characteristics for cns in presence of dc - ac fields .",
    "we noted that the high density of states of conduction electrons in metallic carbon nanotubes and the specific dispersion law inherent in hexagonal crystalline structure result in a uniquely high gain at these frequencies than the corresponding values for semiconducting ones .",
