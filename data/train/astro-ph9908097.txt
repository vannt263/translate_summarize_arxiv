    "the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) light - curves are complex and irregular , without any systematic temporal features ( fishman & meegan 1995 ) and an understanding of the origin of the temporal behavior of grbs remains an open issue .",
    "statistical studies are necessary in order to identify the physical properties of the emission mechanism existent in all or a group of grbs .",
    "recently beloborodov et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter bss98 , have used the fourier analysis of a sample of long grb light - curves to study the statistical properties of their power density spectra ( pds ) .",
    "the pds features together with other temporal properties of the observed grbs , such as the distributions of the time interval between peaks and of the pulse fluence ( mcbreen et al .",
    "1994 , li & fenimore 1996 ) , can be used to constrain the physical characteristics of the grb source .    in the framework of the internal shock model , the rapid variability and complexity of the grb light - curves is due to the emission from multiple shocks in a relativistic wind ( rees & 1994 , kobayashi et al .",
    "1997 , daigne & mochkovitch 1998 ) .",
    "the ejecta are released by the source during a time comparable to the observed burst duration .",
    "the instability of the wind leads to shocks which convert a fraction of the bulk kinetic energy in internal energy at a distance @xmath0 cm from the central engine .",
    "a turbulent magnetic field is generated and electrons are shock - accelerated , leading to synchrotron emission and inverse compton scatterings . within the framework of the internal shock model an alternative hypothesis about the particle acceleration and",
    "radiation emission is the quasi - thermal comptonization proposed by ghisellini & celotti ( 1999 ) , in which particles are re - accelerated for all the duration of the collision .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the features of the grb light - curves arising from internal shock model , in order to identify the parameters that affect most strongly the grb emission (  2 ) . by comparing the features of the simulated bursts with the observed burst pds and the distributions of the interval time between peaks and of the pulse fluence",
    ", we constrain some of the physical properties of the ejecta .",
    "we simulate grb light - curves by adding pulses radiated in a series of internal shocks that occur in a transient , unstable relativistic wind .",
    "as we showed in psm99 the observed burst variability time - scale depends mostly on the wind dynamics , its optical thickness and its radiative efficiency in the batse window .",
    "here we model the wind dynamics and the emission processes as in psm99 , but we include a more accurate treatment of the photon down - scattering on the cold electrons in the wind .",
    "we calculate the effect of the photon diffusion through the colliding shells and the wind on the pulse duration and on the energy of the emergent photon , rather than just attenuating the pulse fluence according to the optical thickness of the wind through which it propagates",
    ". however the contribution of these photons to the duration of the received pulses may be important for bursts that are not very optically thin , and the photon down - scattering should be taken into account for more reliable calculations of grb light - curves .",
    "as described in psm99 , the wind is discretized as a sequence of @xmath1 shells , where @xmath2 is the duration time of the wind ejection from the central source and @xmath3 is the average interval between consecutive ejections .",
    "the shell lorentz factors @xmath4 are random between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath6 can be constant during @xmath2 ( `` uniform wind '' ) or modulated on time scale @xmath7 ( `` modulated wind '' ) .",
    "the shell mass @xmath8 is drawn from a log - normal distribution with an average value @xmath9 and a dispersion @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the total mass in the wind , allowing thus the occasional ejection of very massive shells .",
    "the total mass is determined by requiring that @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the wind luminosity .",
    "the time interval @xmath14 between two consecutive ejections @xmath15 and @xmath16 is proportional to the @xmath15-th shell energy , resulting in a wind luminosity constant throughout the entire wind , and equal to a pre - set value @xmath13 .",
    "this implies that more energetic shells are followed by longer `` quiet '' times , during which the `` central engine '' replenishes .",
    "given the wind ejection , we calculate the radii where internal collisions take place and determine the emission features for each pulse : observer frame duration , fluence , and photon arrival time @xmath17 , accounting for relativistic and cosmological effects .",
    "the peak photon flux for each pulse is calculated assuming the pulse shape that norris ( 1996 ) identified in the real bursts , described by a two - sided exponential function .",
    "the addition of all the pulses , as seen by the observer in the 50300 kev range ( the @xmath18 and @xmath19 batse channels ) gives the burst @xmath20-ray light - curve , that is binned on time - scale of 64 ms and is used for the computation of the power spectrum .",
    "for each collision there is a reverse ( rs ) and a forward shock ( fs ) .",
    "the shock jump equations allow the calculation of the physical parameters of the shocked fluids ( panaitescu & 1999 ) , determine the velocity of these shocks @xmath21 , the compression ratio , the thickness @xmath22 of the merged shell at the end of the collision , and the internal energy in the shocked fluid @xmath23 ( primed quantities are measured in the co - moving frame ) .",
    "the accelerated electrons - a fraction @xmath24 of the total number - have a power - law distribution of index @xmath25 , starting from a low lorentz factor @xmath26 . assuming that the energy stored in electrons is a fraction @xmath27 of the internal energy , we calculate @xmath26 ( see psm99 ) .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath28 is parameterized through the fraction @xmath29 of the internal energy it contains : @xmath30 .",
    "we assume that between two consecutive collisions the thickness of the shell increases proportionally to the fractional increase of its radius @xmath31 .",
    "the shell internal energy increases in each collision by the fraction of @xmath23 that is not radiated , and decreases during the expansion due to adiabatic losses .    the shock - accelerated electrons radiate and the emitted photons can be up - scattered on the hot electrons ( @xmath32 ) or down - scattered by the cold ones ( @xmath33 ) . far from the klein - nishina regime the optical depth to up - scattering is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the co - moving electrons density and @xmath36 is the radiative time scale , with @xmath37 the synchrotron cooling time and @xmath38 the comptonization parameter ( for @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) . the optical thickness @xmath41 for the cold electrons within the emitting shell is evaluated by taking into account the cold electrons within the hot fluid , those that were accelerated but have cooled radiatively while the shock crossed the shell , and those within the yet un - shocked part of the shell .",
    "a fraction @xmath42 of the synchrotron photons is inverse compton scattered @xmath43 times , unless the klein - nishina regime is reached .",
    "the energy of the up - scattered photon and the ratio of the compton to synchrotron power can be cast in the forms : @xmath44   \\ ; , \\label{nuic}\\ ] ] @xmath45^{n_{ic } } \\right\\ } \\;,\\ ] ] which take into account the upper limits imposed by the klein - nishina effect .",
    "figure 1@xmath46 shows the evolution of the synchrotron and inverse compton peak energies during the wind expansion : the energy is lower for larger collisions radii , due to the increased shell volume and the less relativistic shocks , which lead to lower magnetic fields and electron random lorentz factors .",
    "the duration @xmath47 of the emitted pulse ( ignoring the diffusion through optically thick shells ) is determined by ( 1 ) the spread in the photons arrival time @xmath48 due to the geometrical curvature of the emitting shell , ( 2 ) the shock shell - crossing time @xmath49 , ( where @xmath50 is the shell pre - shock flow velocity ) , and ( 3 ) the radiative cooling time @xmath51 , which we add in quadrature to determine @xmath47 .",
    "as shown in figure 1b , all these time scales increase on average with radius : @xmath52 is proportional to @xmath53 , @xmath54 increases due to the continuous widening of the shell , and @xmath55 is longer for later collisions because @xmath26 and @xmath28 are lower . for @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    "the radiative cooling time is negligible respect to @xmath52 and @xmath54 for collisions occurring at @xmath59 cm , while for larger radii @xmath55 is the dominant contribution to the pulse duration ( figure 1b ) . for the assumed linear shell broadening between consecutive collisions",
    "we find numerically that the angular spread and shock - crossing times are comparable during the entire wind expansion .",
    "the optical thickness @xmath41 is mainly determined by the wind luminosity @xmath13 and the range of lorentz factors in the wind . in figure 1@xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 most collisions occur at @xmath63 ",
    "@xmath64 cm where the emitting shells are optically thin . for lower lorentz factors ( @xmath65 )",
    "the collisions take place at smaller radii ( @xmath66 cm ) and the wind is optically thick ( figure 1@xmath67 ) . when @xmath68 photons are down - scattered by the cold electrons before they escape the emitting shell , leading to a decrease in the photon energy and an increase of the pulse duration .",
    "for down - scatterings occurring in the thomson limit ( @xmath69 ) the energy of the emergent photon can be approximated by @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the average number of scatterings suffered by a photon . for more energetic photons ,",
    "we evaluate @xmath72 numerically , because the cross section depends on the photon energy and changes after each photon - electron interaction . for the set of parameters considered in this paper ,",
    "the thompson limit is usually a good approximation to treat the down - scattering of the synchrotron photons during all the wind expansion . for the smaller collision radii the inverse compton emission peaks at large comoving frame energies and the general case has to be considered .",
    "figure 1@xmath73 shows the evolution of the synchrotron and inverse compton observer frame peak energies for a thick wind . at @xmath74 cm , @xmath75 and",
    "the @xmath76 kev synchrotron emission is down - scattered by an order of magnitude , while @xmath77 mev inverse compton radiation is down - scattered to @xmath78 kev .",

    "for a given pulse , we add to the pulse duration the diffusion time it takes the photon to propagate through all the shells of optical thickness above unity . as shown in figure 1@xmath67 , the wind optical thickness is 12 orders of magnitude smaller than the optical thickness of the emitting shell ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "nevertheless the photon diffusion through the optically thick shells in the wind can contribute up to 30% to the pulse duration because of the broadening of the shell width during the wind expansion .",

    "not too far from equipartition , the radiative timescale is determined by the synchrotron losses .",
    "+ 3 ) the _ window efficiency _ is the fraction of the radiated energy that arrives at observer in the 50300 kev band .",
    "the calculation of @xmath91 is based on the approximation of the synchrotron spectrum by three power - laws , with breaks at the cooling frequency @xmath104 and the peak frequency @xmath105 ( at which the @xmath26-electrons radiate ) .",

    "if @xmath109 then @xmath110 the inverse compton spectrum has the same shape but is shifted to higher energy by the factor implied by equation ( [ nuic ] ) . for optically thick emitting shells we approximate the burst spectrum as given in equations ( [ fnu1 ] ) and ( [ fnu2 ] ) , using the down - scattered cooling and peak frequencies .",
    "in this section we analyze the effect of the model parameters on two distributions that characterize the grb temporal structure : the pds and the distribution of the interval @xmath111 between peaks .",

    "the light - curve peaks are identified with the peak finding algorithm ( pfa ) described by li & fenimore ( 1996 ) . for each time bin @xmath115 with a photon flux @xmath116 higher than those of the neighboring time bins , we search for the times @xmath117 and @xmath118 when the photon fluxes @xmath119 and @xmath120 satisfy @xmath121 .",

    "the 50300 kev efficiency of the synchrotron and the inverse compton emissions is determined by the strength magnetic field @xmath28 . while for @xmath137 the emission is dominated by synchrotron radiation , for values of the magnetic field well below equipartition ( @xmath138 ) the burst emission is dominated by the inverse compton . because the shape of the pds does not change",

    "if the wind is uniform @xmath140 is the same for all the shells , resulting in a steady decrease of @xmath89 during the wind expansion .",
    "if the range of shell ejection lorentz factors is variable on time scale of the order of @xmath2 ( a `` modulated '' wind ) , @xmath140 reflects the initial modulation in @xmath6 and large radii collisions that are dynamically efficient are still possible .",

    "the @xmath15-th shell ejection lorentz factor is given by @xmath143 where @xmath144 is a random number between 0 and 1 , and @xmath145 .",
    "the modulation shifts the power from high to low frequencies , and the magnitude of this shift depends on the modulation period . if @xmath146 the effect of the modulation for interaction radii less than @xmath147 cm ( corresponding to @xmath148 s ) is negligible and the wind evolves as in the uniform case : the @xmath89 decreases from 5% to 0.2% when @xmath80 increases from 0.01 s to 1 s ( figure 3@xmath46 ) . for @xmath149 cm the modulation becomes relevant : the wind is formed of groups of few massive shells with different lorentz factors .",
    "the dynamical efficiency remains constant for subsequent collisions between massive shells , which yield long pulses ( @xmath150  @xmath151 s ) that carry a substantial fraction of the total burst fluence .",
    "figure 3@xmath67 shows that the dependence on @xmath80 of the synchrotron efficiency @xmath152 of the fs pulses has a similar behavior as that of @xmath89 , because the internal energy density in the shocked plasma depends on @xmath89 .",
    "for an higher internal energy , the minimum electron lorentz factor @xmath26 increases , leading to a higher energy emission and a shorter radiative cooling time - scale . therefore the synchrotron efficiency remains constant on the same range of @xmath80 where is constant the dynamical efficiency , contributing to a shift of power to low frequencies in the pds .",
    "the optical thickness of the wind depends mostly on the range of shell lorentz factors ( @xmath153 ) and on the wind luminosity ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "figure 4@xmath60 shows pdss for two ranges of lorentz factors , 301000 and 10150 . in the former case",
    "the wind is essentially optically thin , and the photon diffusion does not affect the pulses duration @xmath80 , that increases with @xmath53 ( figure 4@xmath46 ) from 0.01 s to 1 s , between @xmath154 and @xmath64 cm . in the latter case the wind is optically thick , in 80% of the collisions @xmath155 , and the pulse duration is given by the diffusion time : @xmath79 decreases from @xmath156 s to @xmath157 s between @xmath158 cm and @xmath159 cm , where @xmath80 is determined mainly by the shell curvature and thus increases with @xmath53 . for the optically thick wind the long pulses are generated at smaller @xmath53 where the efficiency has the maximum value , and the pulse energy increases with @xmath80 ( figure 4@xmath67 ) .",
    "the pds has more power at low frequency and the time intervals between peaks are longer than in the optically thin case ( figure 4@xmath124 ) .",
    "the 50300 kev efficiency is of the same order for the two cases : @xmath160 and @xmath161 for a range of lorentz factors of 301000 and 10150 , respectively .",
    "an increase in the wind luminosity has a similar effect on the pds shape as a decrease in @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in the latter case",
    "the wind becomes thicker because the shells are more massive .",
    "the variability time scale @xmath112 affects the dynamical evolution of the shells in the following way .",
    "if the time intervals between successive ejections delays decreases then the collisions occur at smaller radii , where the wind is more optically thick .",
    "the differences between the lorentz factors diminish faster ( there are more shells for smaller @xmath112 ) , reducing the dynamical efficiency for short pulses .",
    "for the modulated wind this effect is more relevant than in the random case .",
    "the duration @xmath2 of the wind ejection determines mainly the number of shells , and changes in @xmath2 do not affect much the evolution of uniform winds .",
    "however , for a modulated wind , @xmath2 also determines the number of periods in the lorentz factor ( if the duration of a period is independent of @xmath2 ) , influencing thus the clumping of shells .",
    "the burst redshift determines the co - moving energy range which is redshifted into the observing range , leading to a change in the total pulse efficiency , and altering the observed pulse duration .",
    "obviously , by increasing the burst redshift , power is shifted from higher to lower frequencies .",
    "an analysis of the pds of real bursts was presented by bss98 .",
    "they calculated the fourier transform of 214 long ( @xmath162 s ) and bright burst , and have found that the average pds is a power - law ( @xmath163 , @xmath73 is frequency ) over almost two orders of magnitude in frequency , between 0.02 hz and 2 hz , where a break is observed , indicating a paucity of pulses with duration less than @xmath164 s. the distribution of intervals between peaks has been studied by mcbreen et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and by li & fenimore ( 1996 ) , who showed that the distributions of the pulse fluence @xmath165 and of the time interval @xmath111 between peaks are consistent with a log - normal distribution .",
    "as was shown in the previous section , if the wind is optically thin and the ejection features are random , the pulse duration increases with the collision radius and the emission efficiency decreases during the wind expansion .",
    "the short inner collisions yield most of the 50300 kev burst emission and the internal shock model predicts a flat pds with equal power at low and high frequency .",
    "thus , in order to explain the observed behavior , we need a configuration of the parameters which shifts power from the short to the long time - scales in the light - curves . moreover , the @xmath111 distribution is not log - normal : figures 2@xmath124 , 3@xmath124 , and 4@xmath124 show that in grbs arising from optically thin , uniform winds there are too many short intervals between peaks respect to a gaussian @xmath166 distribution .",
    "psm99 have identified three possible ways to explain the deficit of pulses with @xmath167 s : + ( 1 ) a reduction in the electron injection fraction .",
    "this increases the photon energy , reducing the window efficiency of the short pulses ( causing the high energy break ) and increasing that of the longer ones .",
    "however the behavior of the pds at lower frequency remains flat ( see figure 2@xmath60 ) .",
    "+ ( 2 ) a modulation of the shell ejection lorentz factor .",
    "this allows different configurations for the collisions series and a higher dynamical efficiencies for longer pulses ( see figure 3@xmath60 ) .",
    "+ ( 3 ) an increase of the optical thickness of the wind . in this case",
    "the down - scattering suffered by the photons as they propagate through the wind increases the pulse duration for the small radii collisions , which yield the shorter duration pulses ( see figure 4@xmath60 ) .    in figure 5@xmath60",
    "we show a simulated light - curve for a square - sine modulated wind ( with @xmath141 ) the burst 50300 kev efficiency is 1% , and the 90% of the rs and 80% of the fs propagate in optically thick shells .",
    "if @xmath168 ( the free parameter of the pfa ) , we find 22 pulses in the light - curve shown in figure 5@xmath60 . in order to have more peaks we simulate four light - curves with the same injection features and wind parameters and we calculate the interval between peaks @xmath111 ( figure 5@xmath124 ) and peak fluence @xmath165 ( figure 5@xmath46 ) distributions",

    "figure 6@xmath124 shows a burst - averaged pds whose features are similar to that found by bss98 in real bursts .",
    "the wind ejection is modulated by a square sine ( ) with a random period between @xmath195 and @xmath2 .",
    "about 40% of the 300 simulated bursts have peak photon fluxes brighter than @xmath174 .",
    "taking into account that the average redshift for these bursts is @xmath196 the average burst duration @xmath197 is close to the value @xmath198 s of the bursts used by bss98 ( the factor 1.5 was determined numerically and represents the ratio between the burst duration at the source redshift and @xmath2 ) .",
    "as can be seen in figure 6@xmath124 , @xmath163 between 0.04 hz and 2 hz and falls off steeper at frequencies larger than 2 hz . the model parameters that led to the pds of figure 6@xmath124 yield bursts whose integral intensity distribution is shown in figure 6@xmath60 , which consistent with the distribution found by pendleton ( 1996 ) : excluding the bursts dimmer than @xmath174 , the model has @xmath199 for 9 degrees of freedom .",
    "we have calculated power density spectra of grbs arising from internal shocks in an unsteady relativistic wind . by studying how the features of these spectra depend on the model parameters ( figures 2 , 3 , and 4 ) , we have identified a set parameters ( figure 6 ) that leads to bursts whose average pds exhibits an @xmath200 behavior ( where @xmath73 is frequency ) for @xmath201 , as found by bss98 in real grbs . moreover , the integral intensity distribution of the simulated bursts is consistent with that observed by pendleton ( 1996 ) , and the distributions of the time intervals between peaks and of the pulse fluences are consistent with the log - normal distributions identified by li & fenimore ( 1996 ) in real bursts .",
    "the characteristics of the modeled bursts with the above mentioned features are : ( 1 ) a sub - unity electron injection fraction , required to increase the radiative efficiency of the larger collision radii , ( 2 ) a modulated lorentz factor of the ejected shells , necessary to increase the dynamical wind efficiency during the wind expansion and , ( 3 ) a shells optical thickness to scattering on cold electrons above unity , required to increase the duration of the pulses as they propagate through the colliding shells and the wind .    in the internal shock model ,",
    "the most efficient collisions , with a dynamical efficiency of 10 - 20% and a radiative efficiency of @xmath202 , happen in the first part of the wind expansion where the wind optically thickness is higher and the angular spread time , the shell shock - crossing time and the electrons cooling time are shorter ( @xmath203 0.5 s ) . in order to reproduce the observed break at 2 hz in the pds",
    ", we have previously ( see psm99 ) attenuated the fluence of these short pulses according to an high wind optically thickness , with a resulting low burst efficiency ( 10@xmath204 for an uniform wind and 10@xmath205 for a modulated one ) .",
    "the study of the photon diffusion , presented here , allowed us to find model parameters that yield an 1% efficiency of converting the wind kinetic energy into 50300 kev emission . for an optically thick wind",
    ", the pulse duration of the first , efficient collisions at small radii is determinated by the time the photons take to escape the shells , that depends only on the colliding shells width and optically thickness @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath206 the diffusion time for the efficient collisions is @xmath207 0.5 s and the simulated average pds shows the break at 2 hz with a burst efficiency close to the maximal value ( few % ) admitted by the model ( see also kumar 1999 ) .",
