    "the problem of thermoconvective instabilities in fluid layers heated from below has become a classical subject in fluid mechanics @xcite .",
    "it is well known that two different effects are responsible for the onset of motion when the temperature difference becomes larger than a certain threshold : gravity and capillary forces . when both effects are taken into account the problem",
    "is called bnard - marangoni ( bm ) convection @xcite . at the beginning theoretical studies considered layers of infinite horizontal extent without modelling lateral side - wall effects always present in experiments .",
    "more recently experiments have been concerned with confined containers with different geometries @xcite , and consecuently theoretical and numerical studies have followed the same way @xcite .",
    "solving numerically hydrodynamical problems of incompressible fluids raises the question of handling first order derivatives for pressure in a closed container and determining its boundary conditions . in the velocity - pressure formulation",
    "@xcite first order derivatives are avoided by deriving a poisson equation for pressure @xcite , although the problem of finding its boundary conditions still remains .",
    "dirichlet and neumann conditions are studied in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite and good results are obtained with neumann conditions in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work ,",
    "the sensitivity of the results , with respect to artificial pressure boundary conditions , is reported .",
    "the results we mention refer to rigid boundary conditions in the velocity field and purely hydrodynamical problems , but the issue of thermoconvection with free or marangoni conditions for the velocity at the upper surface which we treat here has not been addressed . to avoid spurious results in the primitive variables formulation the finite difference and finite element methods use staggered grids , but",
    "this is not necessary with the collocation method we propose in this article .    in thermoconvection problems pressure",
    "is usually avoided . in refs .",
    "@xcite the method of potentials of velocity is used to eliminate the variable of pressure from the equations .",
    "this technique raises the order of the differential equations and additional boundary conditions may be required .",
    "this is particularly troublesome in cylindrical coordinates where high order derivatives cause awkward difficulties .",
    "the spectral method used in ref .",
    "@xcite allows the removal of pressure in the primitive variables formulation , however the collocation method that we study here is easier to implement .    in this paper we present several pressure boundary conditions that allow us to solve thermoconvective problems in the primitive variables formulation",
    "this is shown to be very useful when dealing with cylindrical coordinates . in the second section",
    "we perform the linear stability analysis of the marangoni problem in an infinite horizontal fluid layer . since it has an exact solution it is used as a test problem to be compared with the numerical results obtained in the primitive variables formulation and several pressure boundary conditions .",
    "we use a chebyshev collocation method and sensivity to the pressure boundary conditions is observed only in the convergence rate of the method . in the third section we study the bm problem in cylindrical geometry in the primitive variables formulation with the boundary conditions that provide better convergence for the test problem .",
    "we explain the methodology in detail .",
    "we study the convergence of the numerical results and compare them with the previous bibliography on the subject . in the fourth section conclusions",
    "are presented .",

    "the domain is : @xmath0 in the vertical direction a temperature gradient is imposed .",
    "it is well known that motion sets in after the vertical temperature gradient has reached a critical value .",
    "the only mechanism that we consider in developing convection is the marangoni effect , which consist of the variation of the surface tension with temperature . in the reference state",
    "there is no motion and heat propagates by conduction only . to study the linear stability of this state",
    "we must solve the linearized equations for the perturbations from the reference state .",
    "as there are no boundary conditions in the horizontal directions and the basic state is invariant under translations in those directions it is possible to take the fourier modes in those coordinates . @xmath1",
    "the linear problem to be solved is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the velocity field of the fluid , @xmath4 is the temperature , @xmath5 the pressure , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the prandtl number which is considered infinite .",
    "the boundary conditions are : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the biot number and @xmath12 is the marangoni number which takes into account the variation of the surface tension with temperature .      classically , pressure is eliminated and the following set of equations and boundary conditions are obtained , @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "this formulation will be called p1 in the following text .",
    "it can be easily shown that the @xmath15 and @xmath4 solutions are @xmath16 introducing them into the equations ( [ eq:31])-([eq:34 ] ) we get a linear system of equations for the unknowns @xmath17 .",
    "the solvability condition for the system gives the following dependence of the critical marangoni number on @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a function of @xmath18 , @xmath21 .",

    "differences in accuracy between p1 and p3 could be due to the fact that p1 is a higher order problem .",
    "on the other hand p2 diminishes its efficiency with respect to p3 because of the boundary conditions considered . although sensitivity of the numerical method to pressure boundary conditions has been addressed @xcite it seems here that it is not much more important than other effects such as increasing the order of the derivatives in the equations .",
