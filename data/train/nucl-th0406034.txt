    "during last forty years the fisher droplet model ( fdm ) @xcite , on one hand , was extensively used to analyze the condensation of gaseous phase ( droplets of all sizes ) into liquid .",

    "the fdm inspired the formulation of a more sophisticated model , the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) @xcite , which describes not only the gaseous phase of nuclear fragments , but the liquid phase ( nuclear matter ) as well on the same footing @xcite .    applying the fdm to the nuclear fragment of @xmath0-nucleons ,",

    "michael fisher had postulated eq .",
    "( [ one ] ) and this kind of temperature dependence of the surface tension because the latter naturally leads to the existence of critical temperature @xmath5 .",
    "this is , of course , not a unique parametrization of the surface tension .",
    "the smm , for instance , successfully employs another one @xcite @xmath12^{5/4}. $ ] therefore , it is necessary to study a few simple , but quite fundamental questions , `` what is the origin of the fisher parametrization for the temperature dependent surface tension in three dimensions ? does any physical motivation favor the fisher parametrization ? ''",
    "this work is devoted to these questions of fundamental importance .",
    "to answer these main questions we will consider the statistical model of surface deformations .",
    "we will , however , impose a necessary constraint that the deformations should conserve the total volume of the fragment of @xmath0-nucleons .",
    "as we will see , the most interesting result corresponds to the deformations of vanishing amplitude .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the shape of deformation can not be important and we can choose one which is regular to simplify our presentation .",
    "for this reason we shall consider cylindrical deformations of positive height @xmath13 ( hills ) and negative height @xmath14 ( dales ) , with @xmath15 nucleons at the base . for simplicity it is assumed that the top ( bottom ) of the hill ( dale ) has the same shape as the surface of original fragment of @xmath0 nucleons .",
    "our main assumptions are as follows : ( i ) the statistical weight of deformations @xmath16 is given by the boltzmann factor due to the change of the surface @xmath17 in units of the surface per one nucleon @xmath18 ; ( ii ) the hill s heights @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the maximal height of the hill with @xmath15 nucleons at the base ) have the same probability @xmath21 besides the statistical one ; ( iii ) the same two assumptions are valid for the dales as well .",
    "as we will see , these assumptions are not too restrictive , but allow us to simplify the analysis .    under adopted assumptions it is possible to find the one - particle statistical partition of the deformation of the @xmath15 nucleons base as a convolution of two probabilities : @xmath22 } { \\sigma_{\\rm o } p_k h_k } \\ , , % \\",
    "] ] where upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to hills ( dales ) . here",
    "@xmath23 is the perimeter of the cylinder base .",
    "now we have to find a geometrical partition ( degeneracy factor ) or the number of ways to place the center of a given deformation on the surface of @xmath0-nucleon fragment while it is occupied by the set of @xmath24 deformations of the @xmath25 nucleons base .",
    "our next assumption is that the desired geometrical partition can be given in the excluded volume approximation @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the area occupied by the deformation of @xmath15 nucleon base ( @xmath28 ) , @xmath29 is the full surface of the fragment , and @xmath30 is the @xmath0-dependent size of the maximal allowed base on the fragment .",
    "it is clearly seen now that the denominator in the right hand side ( r.h.s . ) of ( [ three ] ) corresponds to the available surface to place the center of each of @xmath31 deformations that exist on the fragment surface .",
    "it is necessary to impose the condition @xmath32 which ensures that the deformations do not overlap on the available surface of the fragment .",
    "( [ three ] ) is the van der waals excluded volume approximation usually used in statistical mechanics at not too high particle densities @xcite and it can be derived for the objects of different sizes in a spirit of a method proposed in @xcite .    according to eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) the statistical partition for the hill with a @xmath15-nucleon base matches that of the dale , i.e. @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , the grand canonical surface partition ( gcsp ) @xmath34}{n^+_k!}^{n^+_k } \\frac { \\left [ z_k^- { \\cal g } \\right]}{n^-_k!}^{n^-_k}\\right ] % \\theta(s_1 { \\cal g})\\ ,   % \\ ] ] corresponds to the conserved ( on average ) volume of the fragment because the probabilities of hill and dale of the same base are identical .",
    "the presence of @xmath35-function in ( [ four ] ) ensures that only configurations with positive value of the free surface of fragment are taken into account .",
    "however , this makes the calculation of the gcsp very difficult . because of the explicit @xmath36 dependence of the maximal base of deformations via @xmath37 the standard trick to deal with the excluded volume partitions , the usual laplace transform method @xcite in @xmath36 , can not overcome this difficulty",
    "however , the gcsp ( [ four ] ) can be solved with the help of the recently developed laplace - fourier technique @xcite .",
    "the latter employs the identity @xmath38 which is based on the fourier representation of the dirac @xmath39-function .",
    "the representation ( [ five ] ) allows us to decouple the additional @xmath36-dependence in @xmath37 and reduce it to the exponential one , which can already be integrated by the laplace transform @xcite @xmath40}{n^+_k!~ s_1^{n^+_k } } ^{n^+_k }   % \\frac { \\left [ z_k^- s^{\\prime } { \\textstyle e^ { k\\,s_1(i \\eta -\\lambda ) } }",

    "then all @xmath43 were summed independently leading to the exponential function .",
    "now the integration over @xmath44 in ( [ six ] ) can be straightforwardly done resulting in @xmath45    where the function @xmath46 is defined as follows @xmath47 % ~e^ { - k\\,s_1\\tilde\\lambda   } \\ , .",

    "for finite fragment surface the structure of singularities of the isochoric partition ( [ seven ] ) can be complicated . to see this",

    "this remarkable answer is a partial example of the general theorem on the laplace - fourier transformation properties proved in @xcite .",
    "the simple poles in ( [ nine ] ) are defined by the condition @xmath55 and the latter can be cast as a system of two coupled transcendental equations @xmath56 % % ~{\\textstyle e^{- k\\,r_n } } \\cos(i_n   k)\\ , , % \\\\",

    "so far eqs .",
    "( [ eleven ] ) and ( [ twelve ] ) are rather general and can be used for particular models which specify the height of hills and depth of dales .",
    "but we can give an absolute supremum for the real root @xmath59 of these equations .",
    "for this purpose it is sufficient to consider the limit @xmath60 , because for @xmath61 the right hand side ( r.h.s . ) of ( [ eleven ] ) is a monotonously increasing function of @xmath62 . since @xmath63 are the monotonously decreasing functions of @xmath20 , the maximal value of the r.h.s .",
    "of ( [ eleven ] ) corresponds to the limit of infinitesimally small amplitudes of deformations , @xmath64 . under these conditions eq .",

    "defined by ( [ twelve ] ) the inequality @xmath68 can not become the equality for all values of @xmath15 simultaneously , then it follows that the real root of ( [ eleven ] ) obeys the inequality @xmath69 .",
    "the last result means that in the limit of infinite fragment , @xmath70 , the gcsp is represented by the farthest right singularity among all simple poles @xmath71 @xmath72^{-1 } } % % % \\ ] ] there are two remarkable facts regarding ( [ fourteen ] ) : first , this result is model independent because in the limit of vanishing amplitude of deformations all specific parameters of the model have dropped out ; second , in evaluating ( [ fourteen ] ) we did not specify the shape of the fragment under consideration , but only implicitly required that the fragment surface together with deformations is a regular surface without self - intersections .",
    "therefore , for vanishing amplitude of deformations the latter means that eq .",
    "( [ fourteen ] ) should be valid for any self - non - intersecting surfaces .    for spherical fragments the r.h.s",

    "the circles and squares represent the two branches @xmath76 and @xmath77 of the roots , respectively .",
    "the curve is defined by the approximation given by ( [ nineteen ] ) and ( [ twenty ] ) ( see text for more details ) .",

    "note please that this equation for the critical temperature remains valid for the temperature dependent @xmath79 as well .",
    "it is also surprising that the degeneracy factor @xmath80 in ( [ fourteen ] ) is only 12.5 % larger than the corresponding factor of the self - avoiding polygons on the two - dimensional square lattice @xcite .    for the large , but finite fragments",

    "this result shows that the total contribution of all complex poles in ( [ ten ] ) is negligibly small compared to the leading term ( [ fourteen ] ) for a fragment of a few nucleons already .",
    "the latter , however , requires a more careful accounting for the volume conservation of a fragment .",
    "the developed model allows us to give the upper limit for the surface entropy because it corresponds to the vanishing amplitude of deformations and , therefore , the specific features of the model were irrelevant for our analysis . to find the next order correction to the surface entropy one has already to consider the underlying model for deformations .",
    "we , however , would like to show how the power law may arise within the hdm .",
    "for this purpose let us consider the left equality in ( [ thirteen ] ) which is valid for small heights of deformations .",
    "it can be shown that the following ansatz @xmath102 for the deformation energy @xmath103 } ~   %   \\frac{s_1}{s_a } \\ln \\left ( \\frac{s_1}{s_a } \\right ) % % \\ ] ] of @xmath15 nucleon base , indeed , generates the fisher power law @xmath104 for the gcsp ( [ fourteen ] ) of an @xmath0-nucleon fragment . from ( [ twtwo ] )",
    "it is clearly seen that the term @xmath105 is the entropy which gives an _ a priori _ uncertainty to measure the position of @xmath15 nucleons of area @xmath18 on the surface of the fragment .",
    "a comparison of ( [ twtwo ] ) with any @xmath106 in the left equality ( [ thirteen ] ) shows that in the limit @xmath107 the ansatz ( [ twtwo ] ) corresponds to a negligible correction compared to the exponentials @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , the fisher power law is too delicate for the model developed to study the surface partition of large fragments .    in conclusion , we developed a simple statistical model which allowed us to derive analytically the general expression ( [ ten ] ) for the gcsp .",
    "this result is achieved by the laplace - fourier transformation technique to the isochoric ensemble .",
    "we named this ensemble because the hdm obeys the volume conservation of a fragment under consideration .",
    "the volume conservation is accounted for by the equal statistical probabilities for the hills and dales of the same base .",
    "the limit of vanishing deformations allowed us to find a supremum for the surface entropy of the large fragments which , remarkably , exceeds the fisher original assumption by only 6 percent .",
    "the analytical analysis of the corrections to the gcsp ( [ fourteen ] ) originating from the complex roots of eqs .",
    "( [ eleven ] ) and ( [ twelve ] ) showed that these corrections are negligible already for the fragment of a few nucleons .",
