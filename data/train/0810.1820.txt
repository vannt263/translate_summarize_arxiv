    "a cooper - pair condensate in a superconductor is destabilized by two kinds of field - induced mechanisms , the paramagnetic depairing and the orbital depairing .",
    "the orbital - limited case , i.e. , a situation with a depairing field @xmath0 determined only by the increase of the number of vortices , conventionally occurs for spin - triplet superconductors with an equal - spin pairing .",
    "recently , it has been noticed that the orbital - limited case occurs in rashba non - centrosymmetric superconductors @xcite in an applied field ( @xmath8 ) perpendicular to the basal plane on the space inversion asymmetry @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the paramagnetic depairing is so effective in rashba superconductors in the parallel field @xmath9 that , as seen in cerhsi@xmath4 @xcite and ceirsi@xmath4 @xcite , @xmath0 is strongly suppressed , and that the vortex state shows peculiar modulated structures @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that these results in the parallel field were obtained in the case with a purely singlet ( or purely triplet ) pairing .",
    "originally , a hallmark of non - centrosymmetric superconductors is a missing parity and the resulting coexistence of spin - singlet and triplet pairing symmetries @xcite .",
    "however , this mixing of pairing symmetries and a coupling between them have not been taken into account so far in studying @xmath0 and the vortex states occurring below it . in relation to this",
    ", it should be noted that the strong anisotropy of @xmath10 due to the anisotropic paramagnetic effect does not seem to be a common feature between rashba superconductors : a strongly suppressed @xmath10 in the parallel field case was realized in a couple of materials @xcite with tetragonal structure , while the @xmath10-curves in cept@xmath4si are nearly isotropic @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we study the depairing field @xmath0 of non - centrosymmetric superconductors with coexisting singlet and triplet pairing components . both of systems with the spin - orbit coupling of rashba type in @xmath9 and those with that of cubic type will be considered here because a comparison between those two cases is found to be useful . following previous works @xcite ,",
    "a moderately large value of the spin - orbit coupling @xmath11 will be assumed , max(@xmath3 , @xmath12 ) @xmath13 , where @xmath12 is the zeeman energy of a conduction electron , and @xmath14 is the averaged fermi energy .",
    "in such materials in a single pairing channel , a one - dimensional modulation @xcite of the superconducting order parameter @xmath15 and the resulting increase of @xmath10 occur as a result of the small but nonvanishing @xmath16 .",
    "we show below that a coupling _ induced by spatial variations of _ @xmath15 between the coexisting singlet and triplet pairing channels is a much stronger origin of elevating @xmath10-values .",
    "when the two pairing channels are equally important , one of the two fss splitted due to the missing parity is favored for the gap formation , and this imbalance between the fss leads to a more perfect disappearance of the paramagnetic depairing than that due to a finite @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "in fact , under proper conditions , the present mechanism based on the missing parity results even in the orbital - limited situation where the paramagnetic depairing is quenched . it is argued that the present results should be closely related to the fact that the @xmath10-anisotropy in rashba superconductors significantly depends on the materials @xcite and are also relevant to the @xmath17-dependence of pairing states of li@xmath5(pd@xmath6pt@xmath7)b @xcite .    through this paper ,",
    "the @xmath10-enhancement due to the mixing of the singlet and triplet pairing channels is discussed , for clarity , by focusing primarily on the cubic case . in the cubic case ,",
    "the @xmath10-enhancement is accompanied , as in the centrosymmetric case with the fulde - ferrell ( ff ) state @xcite , by a helical modulation parallel to @xmath18 of the phase of @xmath15 .",
    "it will be pointed out that this cubic case corresponds to an ideal situation of the familiar fflo mechanism of an @xmath10-enhancement in which the paramagnetic depairing is cancelled by a modulation of @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , it is pointed out that , in this cubic case , the larkin - ovchinnikov ( lo ) state with a periodic amplitude modulation @xcite parallel to @xmath18 can not obtain a gain in energy necessary for its realization .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , the starting model and the formulation",
    "are explained , and possible @xmath0-lines in the cubic noncentrosymmetric case are discussed . as an observable quantity measuring the broken inversion symmetry in the cubic case ,",

    "the @xmath0-curves in the rashba superconductors under a field _",
    "parallel _ to the basal plane are considered for a comparison with the results in sec.ii . a summary and some comments",

    "this will be needed even in some of the ensuing expressions .",
    "note that , in the present case with the cubic spin - orbit coupling breaking the inversion symmetry , the paramagnetic effect appears only through the @xmath72-dependence , which simply shifts the gauge field parallel to @xmath18 in a way _ dependent on _ fs ( see the sign factor @xmath73 in @xmath74 ) .    to obtain the depairing field @xmath0",

    "this restriction to the lowest ll is justified as follows : it is well known that the paramagnetic depairing tends to reverse roles of the lowest ll and higher lls @xcite . in the present cubic case",

    "is merely a consequence of a nonvanishing @xmath119 @xcite , while the sudden appearance of nonzero @xmath91 near @xmath132 indicates a second order transition into the ordinary ff state @xcite .",
    "as the lower two curves in fig.1(a ) show , however , a realistic @xmath101-value ( @xmath133 ) does not lead to a remarkable increase of @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast , effects of a @xmath118-reduction on @xmath10 and @xmath91 are more dramatic : even for @xmath118 of order unity , the @xmath0-enhancement due to the singlet - triplet mixing is much more remarkable than that due to a finite @xmath119 , and the slope of @xmath0 shows a subtle but visible increase below an intermediate temperature upon cooling . as fig.1(b ) shows , this increase of the @xmath10-slope originates from the corresponding increase of @xmath109 , i.e. , the phase modulation of @xmath15 , upon cooling , and the onset temperature of the @xmath109-growth _ increases _ with decreasing @xmath118 .",
    "however , this enhancement of the modulation never means that the paramagnetic depairing becomes more effective due to the missing parity . to explain this , we have also examined the corresponding @xmath0 resulting from the lo - type state @xmath134 $ ] @xcite , where @xmath135 may be different from @xmath78 but is under the same gauge . in this case , the corresponding expression to eq.(15 ) for determining @xmath0 is given simply by neglecting the two @xmath136 terms there .",
    "then , by noting that the lo state appears upon cooling at the temperature where the o(@xmath137 ) term of @xmath138 changes its sign , it is easily seen that the onset of the lo state is independent of @xmath118 .",
    "in contrast , in eq.(15 ) , an additional @xmath91 dependence appearing as a consequence of a finite @xmath118 ( see the r.h.s . of eq.(15 ) ) favors the helical phase modulaton .",
    "thus , the @xmath139-growth enhanced by decreasing @xmath118 in fig.1 is peculiar to the helical ( phase - modulated ) state and does not imply an enhancement of the paramagnetic depairing .",
    "rather , the singlet - triplet mixing makes the lo state significanty unfavorable .",
    "further , the curves in fig.1 also show that an increase of the additional helicity due to a nonzero @xmath119 @xcite becomes more remarkable as the singlet - triplet mixing is increased .    through the discussion on @xmath10",
    ", we have implicitly assumed the _",
    "mean field _",
    "superconducting transition at @xmath10 to be of second order . to check its validity ,",
    "let us consider here the corresponding quartic gl term @xmath140 .",
    "the expression of @xmath140 is briefly explained as follows : recall that , in the familiar centrosymmetric case with no paramagnetic depairing , @xmath140 within the lowest ll takes the form @xmath141 and is positive .",
    "here , @xmath142 denotes a unit vector parallel to a momentum on each fs . in the weak coupling approximation ,",
    "@xmath143 in the present cubic case is simply a sum of contributions from the two fss and is given by @xmath144 which is clearly positive since @xmath145 when @xmath102 .",
    "actually , we have verified that @xmath143 is always positive within the calculations performed by us .",
    "this fact implies that there is no occasion that the second order transition at @xmath10 assumed above is preempted by a discontinuous transition @xcite in the present cubic noncentrosymmetric case .",
    "in addition to the @xmath10-line , an observable measure of the phase modulation of the vortex state in the cubic noncentrosymmetric case will be needed to verify its presence in real systems .",
    "recently , the presence of a nonvanishing component @xmath146 _ perpendicular _ to @xmath18 of the local magnetization @xmath147 in the ordinary fflo vortex lattice has been stressed within the gradient expansion approach @xcite valid for sufficiently large maki parameters . in the phase - modulated ff state ,",

    "as is found by comparing fig.2 with fig.1 , a growth of @xmath109 induced by the mixing of the singlet and triplet pairings results in a reduction of @xmath167 , i.e. , of the paramagnetic depairing , while this reduction of the paramagnetic effect is safely negligible in @xmath168 case with no mixing between the pairing channels , and @xmath167 monotonously increases upon cooling reflecting an enhancement of the paramagnetic effect upon cooling .",
    "thus , the nonmonotonous @xmath30-dependence of @xmath166 seen in @xmath169 and @xmath170 cases at lower temperatures is a consequence of the competition between an enhancement of the paramagnetic depairing upon cooling and its effective reduction due to a growth of @xmath109 .",

    "it will be reasonable to , according to the present results , attribute the apparent absence of paramagnetic depairing in this material under a parallel field to a mixing of two pairing channels with a _ comparable _ weight .",
    "it is quantitatively insufficient to regard the nearly isotropic @xmath10 @xcite as a consequence of a finite @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "the present view on the pairing state of cept@xmath4si , following from studies of the @xmath2-@xmath3 phase diagram , is consistent with a recent proposal @xcite based on microscopic properties .",
    "however , it is unclear at present whether the neglect in the present work of an antiferromagnetic order @xcite existing in cept@xmath4si is justified or not .",
    "according to calculations in ref.@xcite where the vortices are ignored , the presence of an antiferromagnetic order may lead to a significant deviation of the @xmath32-vector from @xmath23 and result in some reduction of the paramagnetic depairing effect . at present , the best candidate for applying the present results in the cubic case will be the familily of li@xmath5(pd@xmath6pt@xmath7)b @xcite . according to a recent study of @xmath10-curves of these materials @xcite",
    ", however , they seem to be well explained in the weak coupling approximation with no paramagnetic effect and in clean limit . since li@xmath5pd@xmath4b is believed to be in the purely @xmath29-wave pairing , this fact may suggest an extremely weak paramagnetic effect in these materials .",
    "nevertheless , the transverse component of the magnetization , stressed in sec.iii , might be measurable , and its experimental search is hoped .",
