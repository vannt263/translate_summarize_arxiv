    "graphene has unique electronic properties due to its special band structure and dirac - like behavior of the electronic quasi - particles.@xcite however , this specific structure has one main draw - back : because of the absence of a band gap and the prediction of klein tunneling,@xcite it is difficult to confine carriers electrostatically .",
    "recently this problem has been overcome by cutting a graphene flake into narrow ribbons , which has been shown to open a gate voltage region of suppressed conductance , called transport gap.@xcite this method can be used to confine carriers in quantum dots.@xcite however , even if by now graphene constrictions are regularly used in combination with quantum dots , either to form the tunnel barriers or as a charge readout detector,@xcite the origin of the formation of the transport gap is still not well understood .",
    "the most common picture is that transport is suppressed due to edge disorder leading to localization.@xcite one possibilty to study the influence of the edges experimentally is to use graphene side gates , as they mainly act on the edges of the structure .",
    "graphene side gates have already proven to be useful in combination with many different graphene structures , for example to study the homogeneity in a graphene hall bar,@xcite to individually tune the tunnel barriers and the dot energies in a graphene quantum dot,@xcite and to locally control the arms of an aharonov - bohm ring.@xcite    in this work , we study the dependence of the transport gap on the constriction geometry and the influence of an applied side gate voltage .",

    "this can be understood by the fact that increasing the width of the constriction or decreasing its length increases the probability of at least one percolating conductive path through the constriction , and therefore decreases the region in energy where transport is governed by localization . for the constrictions with @xmath22  nm and @xmath1=100  nm , @xmath0=100  nm and @xmath1=100  nm respectively @xmath0=85  nm and @xmath1=200  nm , @xmath23 .",
