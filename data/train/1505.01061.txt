    "the study of gravity resonances in randall - sundrum models @xcite is of great importance because , since stable states for most fields do not exist , it points to the possibility of finding unstable massive modes in the membrane .",
    "much of these studies used smooth versions of the background with the rs warp factor recovered for large @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the emergence of resonances is an interesting phenomenological possibility that has been approached mainly numerically .",
    "however , some examples have been studied where an integrable solution was found for bosonic fields @xcite . in order to obtain these solutions a specific form of the background",
    "was chosen such that a simple potential was obtained for an associated schrdinger equation .",
    "that leads to the question : what kind of background allows analytical solutions ?",
    "the answer to this question was given in @xcite where the authors found an associated equation leading to the correct background .",
    "that was possible by the introduction of an arbitrary function describing the region near the ( thick ) brane .",
    "this arbitrary function makes the connection with the effective potential of the schrdinger like equation . with this , the backgrounds used in the literature @xcite are just particular solutions of this equation . besides , many others solutions were found . in particular ,",
    "the fermion case was studied in ref . @xcite but",
    "the solutions were found only numerically .",
    "it happens that the fermion case introduces additional complications because of the coupling with the scalar field .",
    "anyway , it is possible to circumvent this and generalize the idea used for the gravity case : here we find a few examples of analytical solutions . therefore , the complete structure of resonances associated with each of these new solutions are also obtained .",
    "the way chosen to describe the background of the thick brane gives us a better understanding of its structure and can lead to new possibilities .",
    "this letter is organized as follows : in the first section we give a brief review of spin-1/2 fermion background . in the second section we describe fermion in a profile with piecewise warp factor .",
    "the third section is devoted to study fermion in a background with smooth warp factor .",
    "finally , we present the conclusions and perspectives .",
    "we regard here the problem of studying fermions in a randall - sundrum like scenario .",
    "usually it is considered the coupling between fermions and the gravitational fields alongside a coupling between fermions and a scalar field @xmath1 , the stuff the membrane is made of .",
    "indeed , the membrane is regarded as a domain wall embedded in @xmath2 . studies of fermion localization in this context reveals a very natural mechanism of producing chiral fields in @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the new ingredient here is that , if the warp factor is defined in a piecewise way , so must be the scalar field @xmath1 .",
    "the usual coupling is the yukawa one that will be generalized to allow a more complete analysis .",
    "first , we give a brief review of the fermion background .",
    "let us consider a single scalar field thick brane @xmath1 with a potential @xmath4 in ( 4 + 1)-dimensional curved space - time with cosmological constant @xmath5 .",
    "the action describing this model is given by @xmath6\\,,~~   \\label{scalaraction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the scalar curvature , @xmath8 $ ] , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 with @xmath11 the five - dimensional newtonian gravitational constant .",
    "we will use the metric in the conformal coordinates and the line - element is assumed to be @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the warp factor .",
    "the metric tensor @xmath14 presents signature in the form @xmath15 , and @xmath0 stands for the coordinate of the extra spatial dimension .",
    "the scalar field is considered to be a function of @xmath0 only : @xmath16 . from the metric ansatz",
    "the einstein tensor is given by @xmath17 where the prime denotes derivative with respect to the @xmath0 coordinate .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations for the action ( [ scalaraction ] ) with the metric ansatz ( [ metric ] ) after some manipulations are given by : @xmath18    if the @xmath19 symmetry is imposed , namely @xmath20 , we can see from eqs . and that in the limit @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 we have @xmath24 and @xmath25 in this case the bulk is asymptotically ads .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the condition @xmath26 can be satisfied by kink solution @xmath27 .",
    "we shall restrict the bulk asymptotically ads and kink solutions ( with @xmath28 ) through this paper .",
    "we also make @xmath29 for simplicity .    in this background ,",
    "the dirac fermionic action for a spin 1/2 field coupled to the scalar field @xmath1 is    @xmath30 ,      \\label{ffa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 , @xmath32 being the spin connection .",
    "the @xmath33 are the dirac matrices in the five dimensional curved space - time and @xmath34 are the vielbeins : @xmath35 .    the dirac equation in five - dimensional space - time can be derived from the action @xmath36\\psi(x , z)=0\\ , ,   \\label{diraceq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the four - dimensional dirac operator on the brane .    due to the presence of @xmath38 in the eq .",

    "they satisfy the four - dimensional massive dirac equations in the form of @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the kk modes @xmath44 obeys the coupled equations    e^a(z)f((z))_=m_. from these we obtain the schrdinger like equation for each mode @xmath45 where the effective potential @xmath46 depends on the warp factor as bellow @xmath47    the study of the massive modes must be done more carefully .",
    "this happens because when the potential in has the asymptotic behaviour @xmath48 , @xmath49 are linear combination of plane waves and therefore not normalizable .    for massive modes , like in non - relativistic quantum mechanics",
    ", we will use the transmission coefficient to study possible resonances@xcite .",
    "usually , the transmission coefficient represents the probability flux of the transmitted wave relative to the incident wave . in our case ,",
    "the transmission coefficient represents the probability of a fermionic massive mode to pass through the brane .",
    "the idea of the existence of a resonant mode is that for a given mass the transmission coefficient has a peak at this mass value . in our study of resonances",
    "we limit the solutions of that have asymptotic planes wave form .",

    "this is enough to establish how the membrane curves the spacetime with the bulk being asymptotically ads@xcite .    in order to get the desired smooth versions , the functions @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 must be continuous to give @xmath1 and @xmath61 continuous at @xmath62 .",

    "the purpose here is to present a new way to generalize this idea in order to obtain analytical solutions for the fermion field as well .",
    "we focus our attention in right fermions .",
    "the analysis is similar for left fermions . in order to implement the boundary conditions , we restrict to even functions @xmath55 in , guaranteeing that the boundary conditions are satisfied in both edges of the brane , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
