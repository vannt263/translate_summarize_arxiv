    "the magellanic clouds offer the unique possibility to study star clusters in general and binary clusters in particular .",

    "( @xcite ) have surveyed the magellanic clouds in order to catalogue the binary cluster candidates .",
    "the maximum projected centre - to - centre separation of the components of a pair chosen for inclusion in the list of candidates was 18 pc , which corresponds to @xmath3 in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "a binary cluster with larger separation may become detached by the external tidal forces while shorter separations may lead to mergers ( sugimoto & makino @xcite , bhatia @xcite ) .",
    "two clusters may appear to be a binary cluster due to chance line - up while in fact being at different distances within the magellanic clouds and not gravitationally bound to each other .",
    "an estimation of the number of such chance - pairs of objects ( page @xcite ) revealed that less than half of all pairs found are expected statistically . as considerably more double clusters were found , this strongly suggests that at least a subset of them must be true binary clusters , i.e. , clusters that are formed together and/or may interact or even be gravitationally bound .",
    "star clusters form in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , but the details of cluster formation are not yet totally understood ( elmegreen et al .",
    "fujimoto & kumai ( @xcite ) suggest that star clusters form through strong collisions between massive gas clouds in high - velocity random motion .",
    "oblique cloud - cloud collisions result in compressed sub - clouds which revolve around each other and form binary or multiple clusters .",
    "binary star clusters are expected to form more easily in galaxies like the magellanic clouds , whereas in the milky way the required large - scale high - velocity random motions are lacking .",
    "indeed only few binary clusters are known in our own galaxy .",
    "the probability of tidal capture of one cluster by another one is small ( bhatia et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but becomes more probable in dwarf galaxies like the magellanic clouds with small velocity dispersion of the cluster systems ( van den bergh @xcite ) . in that case the clusters would be gravitationally bound , but age differences are likely . tidal interactions between clusters can be traced using isodensity maps ( deoliveira et al .",
    "@xcite , leon et al .",
    "@xcite ) . however , vallenari et al .",
    "( @xcite ) estimated a cluster encounter rate of @xmath4 .",
    "this makes tidal capture of young clusters very unlikely .",
    "interaction between lmc and smc might have led to a higher cluster formation rate and , due to the dynamical perturbance , a higher encounter rate might be possible ( see vallenari et al . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the formation of low - mass star clusters tends to proceed hierarchically in large molecular complexes over several @xmath5 years ( e.g. , efremov & elmegreen @xcite ) .",
    "leon et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggest that in these groups the cluster encounter rate is higher and thus tidal capture is more likely : binary clusters are not born together as a pair with similar ages but are formed later through gravitational capture . an observational test of this scenario would require the detection of evidence of tidal interactions between clusters , whose age differences need to be compatible with the survival times of gmcs .    another binary cluster formation scenario is introduced by theis et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and ehlerov et al . (",
    "@xcite ) : exploding supernovae close to the centre of a giant molecular cloud sweep up the outer cloud material within a few myrs and accumulate it in the shell .",
    "the large amount of matter makes the shell prone to gravitational fragmentation and finally to the formation of many open cluster - like associations . in case of a dense ambient medium outside the cloud or a very massive original molecular cloud",
    "the shell can be strongly decelerated resulting in a recollapse .",
    "a galactic tidal field acting on this recollapsing shell can split it into two or more large clusters , thus forming coeval twin clusters which are , however , not gravitationally bound ( theis @xcite ) .",
    "the fragments may stay together for a long time , though they are gravitationally unbound .",
    "the evolution of their spatial separation mainly depends on the shape of the shock front at the time of fragmentation .",
    "depending on their masses and separations binary clusters will eventually merge or become detached .",
    "a merged binary cluster will have one single but elliptical core ( bhatia & mcgillivray @xcite ) which can also be found in the young blue populous star clusters of the magellanic clouds .",
    "can mergers of former binary star clusters be responsible for at least some of the blue populous clusters in the lmc ?",
    "we are studying binary cluster candidates in the magellanic clouds to investigate whether the cluster pairs are of common origin and if they show evidence for interaction . while it is not possible to measure true , deprojected distances between apparent binary clusters an analysis of their properties can give clues to a possible common origin .",

    "we assume a cylinder with a length of @xmath37 corresponding to @xmath38 2700 pc and a width of @xmath39 or 590 pc .",

    "@xcite ) we get an encounter rate of @xmath43 .",
    "indeed the encounter rate is increased in the lmc bar by a factor of 10 .",
    "however , only very few encounters would result in tidal capture .",
    "the probability of tidal capture will depend strongly on the velocities of the two clusters with respect to each other , the angle of incidence , whether a prograde or retrograde encounter takes place , whether sufficiently angular momentum can be transfered , and whether the clusters are sufficiently massive to survive the encounter .",
    "it seems unlikely that a significant number of young pairs may have formed through tidal capture .",
    "we investigated the stellar densities in and around the triple cluster ngc 1971 , ngc 1972 , and ngc 1969 .",
    "the isopleths do not show connections between the clusters , but reveal the distortion of ngc1971 towards the other two clusters .",
    "ngc1969 is much more extended than can be seen from short exposed optical images .",
    "furthermore we see a clumpy structure on the stellar density map . whether this is due to hierarchical stellar clustering ( see text below ) or",
    "due to background fluctuations can not be clearly said .    comparing isochrones based on the geneva models ( schaerer et al .",
    "@xcite ) with the cmds of each star cluster we find the following ages : @xmath44 myr for ngc 1971 , @xmath45 myr for ngc 1972 , and @xmath46 myr for ngc 1969 .    within the errors all three clusters are similar in age and",
    "may have been formed in the same gmc .",
    "the slight age differences suggest that cluster formation occurred in several episodes , with ngc 1969 as the oldest of the triple cluster which might have triggered the formation of the other two clusters , and ngc 1972 as the smallest and youngest object .",
    "similar evidence for multiple episodes of cluster formation separated by a few tens of myr have also been observed in 30 doradus ( grebel & chu @xcite ) . the triple cluster can be seen as an example of hierarchical stellar clustering ( elmegreen et al . @xcite and references therein ) : all three clusters are embedded in the larger association lh 59 .",
    "the youngest field star population is part of lh 59 and has an age of 40 to 80 myr which corresponds to the ages for the three clusters .",
    "the clumpy structure of ngc 1969 reveals stellar clustering on smaller scales . whether the star clusters are physically connected or not can not be clearly decided .",
    "both ngc 1971 and 1969 show somewhat distorted isopleths which might indicate a possible interaction , but this is highly uncertain . a thorough radial velocity study for",
    "binary and multiple cluster candidates would be helpful .",
    "both ngc1894 and sl341 reveal an elliptical shape on the stellar density map . a significant enhancement between the clusters was not found .",
    "a density gradient can be seen in fig .",
    "[ n1894dens ] in direction of the lmc bar .",
    "whether the elliptical shape of the two clusters is due to interaction or is a peculiarity that is found for a large amount of single clusters in the lmc ( goodwin @xcite ) is unclear .",
    "fitting isochrones to the cmds we find that the components of this cluster pair are coeval within the measurement accuracy with an age of @xmath0 myr .",
    "it is likely that both clusters have formed from the same gmc .",
    "whether they have or had some interaction can not be decided , since most lmc clusters show larger ellipticities than clusters of the milky way .",
    "the models of both fujimoto & kumai ( @xcite ) and theis ( @xcite ) ( see sect . [ intro ] ) provide possible formation scenarios for the triple cluster ngc1971 , ngc1972 & ngc1969 and the cluster pair ngc1894 & sl341 .    the star density map of sl385 & sl387 shows an enhancement between the two clusters which connects the components of this binary cluster candidate .",
    "the enhancement is @xmath47 above the mean of the surrounding field .",
    "however , both clusters have a projected distance of @xmath48 corresponding to 11.1 pc and an extension of @xmath49 or 9.2 pc radius .",
    "it is likely that the isopleths of the clusters are overlapping even if the clusters may have different distances along the line of sight , e.g. both clusters may appear as a pair only due to chance superposition . based on deeper data , leon et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggest the presence of two partially overlapping tidal tails distinguishable by their different stellar populations , which are indicative of a possible encounter between these two clusters of different ages .",
    "based on isochrone fitting to the cmds we derived an age of @xmath1 myr for sl385 , while only a lower age limit of 250 myr could be found for sl387 . if we adopt the ages estimated by vallenari et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , then the age difference is @xmath50 myr , far above the maximum life time of protocluster gas clouds suggested by fujimoto & kumai ( @xcite ) .",
    "we calculated cluster encounter rates for the bar and the disk of the lmc .",
    "we found the cluster encounter rate to be increased by a factor of 10 in the dense , cluster - rich lmc bar as compared to the disk of the lmc , though the rate is still very low ( 2 encounters per gyr ! ) .",
    "since additional conditions such as sufficient angular momentum loss must be fulfilled for a tidal capture of one cluster by another during an encounter , this seems an unlikely formation scenario for the formation of binary clusters .",
    "obtaining radial velocities for a large number of stars in cluster pairs , in their potential tidal tails , and in the surrounding field population would help to evaluate cluster internal and external dynamics and to rule out or confirm the occurrence of interactions .",

    "<S> binary clusters account for more than 10% of the cluster population in the magellanic clouds . </S>",

    "<S> we estimated the cluster encounter rate and suggest that tidal capture is an unlikely formation scenario for the formation of binary clusters . </S>",

    "<S> we present a study of three binary cluster candidates which are located in the bar of the lmc . </S>",

    "<S> a third star cluster , ngc 1969 , is close enough to this pair that all three objects may constitute a triple system . </S>",
    "<S> we present the first age determination that is based on cmds for these star clusters . </S>",
    "<S> our findings suggest that all three clusters are young ( 40 - 70 myr ) and may have been formed in the same gmc . </S>",
    "<S> it can not clearly decided whether the clusters are physically interacting or not .    </S>",
    "<S> ngc1894 & sl341 are located at the south - western rim of the lmc bar . </S>",
    "<S> this pair is studied in detail for the first time : the isopleths of both clusters reveal an elliptical shape . whether this might be interpreted as a sign of interaction or is a peculiarity which is shared with a large amount of lmc star clusters which show higher ellipticities than their counterparts in the milky way remains unclear . from our age determination we find that both clusters are coeval with an age of @xmath0 myr . </S>",
    "<S> this makes a formation from the same gmc a likely scenario .    </S>",
    "<S> sl385 & sl387 are a close pair in the western part of the lmc bar . </S>",
    "<S> we derived ages of @xmath1 myr for sl385 and @xmath2 for sl387 . </S>",
    "<S> the large age difference makes it unlikely that these two clusters formed in the same gmc . </S>"
