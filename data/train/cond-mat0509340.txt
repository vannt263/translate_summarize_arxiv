    "it was shown in @xcite-@xcite that flicker - noise observations can be explained as the result of spectral measurement of very low - frequency but stationary narrow - band fluctuations named as infralow - frequency noise ( ilf noise ) .",
    "such a kind of the spectrum analyzer output takes place when the measured noise spectrum concentrates on frequencies far lower than the operation range of the spectrum analyzer and the ilf - noise correlation time is much longer than the analyzer reciprocal bandwidth .",
    "this result is valid for both analog and digital spectral measurements .",
    "the measured signal is proportional in this case to the mean square rather than the spectral density of the noise , and does not reflect in any way the dependence of the latter on the frequency . within",
    "the scope of this model the universality of the @xmath0 noise follows from the universality of inevitable fluctuations of intensive thermodynamic variables like the temperature and a power - low falling of narrow - band filter spectral distributions in the wings .",
    "it is of importance here the more isolated is the sample under study from the environment the more low - frequency are corresponding fluctuations .",
    "thus , it is impossible to reach the low - frequency saturation region of the noise spectral density if the duration of the measurements is less than response time of the sample - environment coupling .    the necessity to find not only slow fluctuation process but also with @xmath0 -spectrum serves as the reason to call in question some physical mechanisms that by their qualitative attributes and quantitative estimations could be a cause of the excess current noise .",
    "example of this is the temperature model of @xmath0 noise in metal films suggested by voss and clarke on the basis of convincing experiments @xcite . taken initially with hopes and an enthusiasm @xcite-@xcite this theory has later been rejected as an explanation of @xmath0 noise in metal films @xcite,@xcite .",
    "in addition to the proof that the heat conductivity equation does not lead under no circumstances to the @xmath0 -spectrum of temperature fluctuations @xcite , another weighty argument against this model was the absence of spatial correlations of the current fluctuations @xcite,@xcite .    on the contrary",
    ", there is no need in the scope of the ilf - theory for exponentially - wide distribution of relaxation times of any kind @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the spatial correlation measurements is also to be reconsidered since the mean square of the conterminous fluctuations is measured in the case of ilf - noise rather than the spectral density of them .",
    "it will be shown here that all abovementioned objections against temperature fluctuations are withdrawn from the ilf - noise point of view .",
    "it was shown in @xcite-@xcite that the output @xmath1 of an analogue spectrum analyzer as a function of the resonant frequency @xmath2  can be described in a good approximation by the convolution integral @xmath3 ( the notation is slightly changed ) . here",
    "@xmath4 is the spectral density of the stationary random input process @xmath5 with @xmath6 , @xmath7 plays the role of the instrumental function of the spectrum analyzer normalized by the condition @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the effective bandwidth of the analyzer defined by @xmath10    an important point is that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are nonnegative and normalizable functions of the frequency and can be approximated by @xmath13-function each at proper interrelation between the effective bandwidths .",
    "if @xmath14 is noticeably more narrow - band function then @xmath15 and the result of measurement @xmath16 is the common - adopted estimation of the true spectral density @xmath4 . on the other hand",
    "if the investigated spectrum has a narrower contour than the instrumental function , then the result of the measurements will be the contour of the instrumental function @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the frequency at which the maximum of @xmath4 takes place .",
    "spectra are always measured with a narrow - band filter , when the quality factor or the figure of merit @xmath19 .",
    "it is now obvious from eq .",
    "( [ ilf - analog ] ) that when the spectral density of the noise is narrower than @xmath20 , and the noise frequency is low enough @xmath21 [ this is the definition of the term  infralow - frequency  noise ] , then in the usual @xmath22 measurements the output should have a dependence of the @xmath0 type : @xmath23 on the other hand , if the measurements are carried at @xmath24 , then the output signal has the frequency dependence of the far wing of @xmath11 , which likewise has as a rule the form @xmath25 . in either of these case",
    "the measured values are proportional to the mean square @xmath26  of the input random process .      in some respect",
    "the analysis of digital methods , from our point of view , is even simpler , since the formula similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq - base ] ) is already known .",
    "there is the exact expression of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the time slice of the one realization of the random process and@xmath29 is the spectral window .",
    "widely used windows can be written in the form @xmath30 ^{n }   \\label{w - ft}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 corresponds to the bartlett and parzen window , respectively .    the account for finiteness of the time step @xmath32 and application of discrete fourier transformation lead to a little bit changed expressions for spectral windows . for bartlett window one",
    "has @xcite @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the number of data points in the measured realization .",
    "so long as the frequency @xmath36 is small compared with the nyquist frequency , defined by the condition @xmath37 the continuous and discrete fourier transformations yield practically identical expressions for the instrumental function ( spectral window ) . however , since @xmath38 is the periodical function of @xmath36 , the formula ( [ dig - base ] ) can give rise to the aliasing effect .",
    "to avoid this , the input process @xmath12  should be filtered by low - pass filter with cut - off frequency of order of @xmath39 . with this condition in mind , the comparison of eqs.([eq - base])-([norm ] ) to eqs.([dig - base])-([wb - discr ] ) shows that the effective bandwidth is @xmath40 in the digital spectral analysis with the barttlet window .    comparing eqs.([dig - base])-([w - ft ] ) with eqs.([eq - base ] ) and",
    "( [ ilf - analog ] ) we can easily verify that in the case of digital processing of ilf noise measurements , an erroneous observation of the spectrum of the @xmath41 type will also take place .",
    "the digital measurements are always carried out with a constant bandwidth ( @xmath42 ) , at least in each of several frequency intervals into which the entire investigated band is subdivided . as a result of effective  averaging  of the resultant curve over all the sub - bands ,",
    "a spectrum of the type @xmath25 can be obtained with @xmath43 for barttlet window under conditions of ilf - noise measurements .",
    "the observable signature of ilf noise measurements is shown in the figure [ fig ] .    .",
    "two typical values of @xmath44 are presented corresponding to the equivalent noise bandwidth of 20% and 5% , respectively .",
    "the spectral density of the noise at the analyzer input , eq .",
    "( 10 ) , is also shown for comparison . ]",
    "it was calculated in the case of lorentzian form of both the noise spectral density and the narrow - band input filter of the spectrum analyzer .",
    "the following expressions were substituted in eq .",
    "( [ eq - base ] ) as the @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath4@xmath47 to obtain the explicit formula for the spectrum analyzer output @xmath48 the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath49 are defined by the equation of the simple resonant filter one has to correct the misprint there and change @xmath50 taking into account the condition ( 4 ) . ]",
    "it is easily seen that the condition ( [ q - defin ] ) for the analyzer to be narrow - band ( in our case it takes the form @xmath52 ) still does not determine uniquely the @xmath53 dependence .",
    "it is also important to know the relation between @xmath49 and @xmath54 , i.e. , between the widths of the input spectrum and the resonant filter . at @xmath55 ,",
    "i.e. , in the case of a relatively narrower filter , we have the usual result @xmath56 in the other limiting case , however , when @xmath57 , we obtain @xmath58    from eq .",
    "( [ ilf - lorentz ] ) it follows directly that if the measurements are carried out in this situation at a constant @xmath44 , i.e. , under the condition @xmath59 @xmath60 , then the output signal will imitate the presence of noise with a spectrum @xmath0 at the input of the analyzer .",
    "it is clearly seen in fig.[fig ] that although at high frequencies ( @xmath61 ) the true spectral density of the noise ( [ gy - lorentz ] ) is everywhere proportional to @xmath62 and the condition ( [ q - defin ] ) is satisfied , all this is still not enough to let the region of the maximum @xmath63 to make the main contribution to the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq - base ] ) .",
    "conversely , as soon as the filter bandwidth @xmath49  becomes larger than the width of the input spectrum @xmath54 , a transition from the expression ( [ gy - lorentz ] ) to ( [ ilf - lorentz ] ) takes place quite rapidly . in other words ,",
    "the output signal of the analyzer ceases to yield information on the form of the spectrum of the input and begins to vary with frequency in accordance with the @xmath0 law .",
    "the measured curves of such a kind can be found in literature without a discussion of possible ilf - noise interpretation . as a result , some speculations take place in order to explain the observed transition of measured spectral density from @xmath64 to @xmath0 either by means of an unusual frequency dependence of the sample properties ( see , for instance @xcite ) or a hypothesis is offered based on a decomposition of measured noise spectrum on the sum of lorentzian and @xmath0 components originated by different causes @xcite .",
    "investigations of the excess current noise in metal films purposed to shift the study of unclear @xmath0 noise onto the objects that should be physically more defined than non - uniform semiconductors or thermionic emission . if refer a start of that researches into the beginning of 1970th , then it is to be ascertained that more 30 elapsed years and numerous new obtained data have not led to the decision of a problem of origin of such a spectrum .",
    "although observed dependencies of spectral density of resistance fluctuations at any fixed frequency on various parameters of a sample material or measurement conditions point out as if these variables are related with @xmath0 noise , it is failed to deduce from here such its statistical properties as the spectral form or the behavior of spatial correlations .",
    "the approach from the point of view of ilf - noise allows to remove an acuteness of some contradictions and restate the problem for additional experimental studies .",
    "temperature fluctuations as the cause of @xmath0-noise have been rejected by three principal arguments @xcite-@xcite : 1 . the impossibility to deduce the @xmath0 spectral density for fluctuations of the volume - averaged film temperature .",
    "2 . the absence of correlations of current fluctuations in spatially dividual parts of the film .",
    "an effect of the substrate on the measured resistance fluctuations .",
    "let us consider these conclusions from ilf - noise point of view .    to analyze the voss and clarke experiments it is necessary to address to eqs.([dig - base ] ) and ( [ wb - discr ] ) .",
    "assuming @xmath4 is ilf - noise and @xmath36 is not too close to nyquist frequency @xmath65 we have for the relative voltage fluctuations @xcite",
    "@xmath66    here @xmath67 is the spectral density in @xmath68 frequency semi - axis , @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the resistance of the film , @xmath71 is the mean square of the equilibrium temperature fluctuations averaged over the film volume , @xmath72 is the film heat capacity . in the case of the room temperatures and",
    "monatomic metals @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the number of atoms in the film . the substitution of experimental data @xcite combined with the hand - book material parameters for the bi and au films in eq .",
    "( [ ilf - voss - clarke ] ) and hand - made estimations of @xmath75 and @xmath76 results in@xcite @xmath77    the measured values are @xmath78 ( bi ) and @xmath79 ( au ) .",
    "the difference just in 10 times for both cases suggests that there might be some problem with conversion of digital fourier - transform coefficients in @xmath80 spectral density .",
    "anyway , the obtained of - order - of - magnitude coincidence is worthy of notice , taking into account the lack of fitting parameters and indeterminacy of the film dimensions mentioned in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath81 dependence of the analyzer output with @xmath82 follows from eq .",
    "( [ ilf - voss - clarke ] ) as it is explained in sec.2.2 .    as for the lack of spatial correlations of the volume - averaged variables , it is necessary to note , first of all , that the dependence of the relative correlation function like in eq .",
    "( [ ilf - voss - clarke ] ) on the sample volume @xmath83 in the form of @xmath84 may occur only if the characteristic scale @xmath85 of the spatial correlation function @xmath86 is much less than the dimensions of the sample .",
    "the discussion of this point can be found in @xcite from general point of view and in @xcite with reference to @xmath0-noise problems .",
    "therefore , the spectral density of the frequency fourier components should be spatially correlated if they are formed from the spatial fourier components with characteristic wavelength of order of the film dimensions .",
    "thus there is no sense to look for the spatial correlations between different parts of the film if the @xmath84 dependence of correlation function is observed and vice versa .",
    "this receipt regards to the case of the usual spectral measurements . in the case of ilf - noise",
    "the output signal is proportional to the mean square of temperature fluctuations taken in the same instant time . in an equilibrium macroscopic body out of phase transition region such fluctuations",
    "are always uncorrelated on macroscopic scales in accordance with the principle of additivity of extensive variables in thermodynamics .",
    "the explicit prove of this statement for the spatial - averaged temperature fluctuations can be found in @xcite .",
    "so in the case of ilf - noise the absence of spatial correlations can not be an argument against of the temperature - fluctuation origin of @xmath0 -noise .    to consider the dependence of @xmath0 noise on the substrate supporting the film and on a degree of the film - substrate thermal contact one need to account for the last stage of the time relaxation of the averaged temperature fluctuations , i.e. a heat interchange with the environment .",
    "the newton boundary condition for the thermoconductivity equation gives rise to the temperature relaxation with one characteristic time @xmath87 , resulting in the simple expression for the spectral density of the form @xmath88    as @xmath87 is very large in comparison with the reciprocal lowest measured frequency the ilf noise should take place and the dependence on the substrate in eq .",
    "( [ ilf - voss - clarke ] ) comes from the heat capacitance @xmath72 , which is determined by all structure under study including an involved part of the substrate .",
    "the latter depends also on the heat - transfer factor of the film - substrate interface and can increase as @xmath87 decreases , giving rise to the decrease of @xmath89 . as @xmath90 gets into the measured frequency range the usual spectral measurements takes effect and @xmath0 behavior of the spectral density can give place to an ordinary one .",
    "so both characteristic dependencies of spectral measurements on the substrate , which were discussed in @xcite without definite conclusions , can be understood on the base of ilf - noise model within the scope of the temperature fluctuations theory as well as two other problems considered in this section .",
    "one can believe it is premature to discard the temperature fluctuations as the source of @xmath0 noise in metal films .",
    "after eberhard and horn have found out the activation dependence of the @xmath0 -noise on the metal film temperature @xcite the opportunity of @xmath0-noise generation by defects of the lattice was taken into consideration . as usual in the field of flicker noise there is a contradiction between the observable well - defined activation energy and the necessity to have a wide - spread range of these energies to produce @xmath0 spectral dependence over an extended frequency range .",
    "it was note in @xcite there is no possibility to avoid this contradiction using only one activation process .",
    "it was suggested to divide the defect contribution into the current noise by two parts connected with the fluctuations of the defect number due to a vacancy creation / annihilation and the fluctuation of the free - carrier - scattering cross - section due to a defect motion with different activation energy .",
    "the last process should be giving the bread distribution of the activation energy .",
    "however , the observed noise activation energy in various metal films are less than known vacancy formation energy approximately to 10 times @xcite .",
    "hence the observed activation energies should be related with the motion of defects , leaving no place for the usual construction of @xmath0-noise model .",
    "kogan and nagaev @xcite suggested to connect the motion - defect contribution to the flicker noise with some characteristics of the internal friction process .",
    "the reasonable estimation of possible noise level was obtained for that mechanism ( see also @xcite ) but the origin of the wide distribution of the activation energy remained unexplained @xcite .",
    "the ilf - noise model does not required any real @xmath0 spectrum of fluctuations .",
    "it should be sufficiently low - frequency only .",
    "the internal friction processes rather meet this requirement having characteristic relaxation frequencies in the diapasons of @xmath91 hz with magnitudes of reciprocal quality @xmath92 in the @xmath93 range @xcite .",
    "one has to recall that the value of @xmath94 for the background level of the internal friction was used in @xcite with a positive conclusion .",
    "it is worthy to mention the work @xcite where the magnitude of @xmath0 noise in squids was evaluated as a result of ilf - fluctuations of the current in superconducting or normal metal shield surrounding the squid .",
    "the results obtained there keep their significance for high - temperature squids , too @xcite .",
    "it seems evidently that the ilf - noise model could remove contradictions in existing theories of @xmath0 noise and should be involved in the analysis of experimental results in the field of flicker - noise investigations .",
    "a necessary change in the experimental technique has been shortly discussed in @xcite ."
