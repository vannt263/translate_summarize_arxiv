    "heegaard floer homology is a collection of invariants for closed oriented three - manifolds , introduced by peter ozsvth and zoltn szab @xcite .",
    "there are four versions , denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which are graded abelian groups . the hat version @xmath2 is defined as the homology of a chain complex @xmath3 coming from a heegaard diagram of the three - manifold @xmath4 .",
    "the differentials count the number of points in certain moduli spaces of holomorphic disks , which are hard to compute in general .",
    "there is also a relative version of the theory corresponding to pairs @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a knot in @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath6 is null - homologous , then a seifert surface @xmath7 of @xmath6 induces a filtration of the chain complex @xmath3 , and the chain homotopy type of the filtered chain complex is a knot invariant .",
    "the homology groups @xmath8 of successive quotients of filtration levels are called knot floer homology groups ( @xcite ) .",
    "a cobordism between two three - manifolds induces homomorphisms on the heegaard floer homology groups of the two three - manifolds .",
    "in fact , the homomorphisms on @xmath1 and @xmath9 can be used to construct an invariant of smooth four - manifolds with @xmath10 ( @xcite ) , called the ozsvth - szab invariant .",
    "conjecturally , the ozsvth - szab four - manifold invariant is equivalent to the gauge - theoretic seiberg - witten invariant .",
    "heegaard floer homology turns out to be a fruitful and powerful theory in the study of three - dimensional and four - dimensional topology .",
    "it gives an alternate proof of the donaldson diagonalization theorem and the thom conjecture for @xmath11 ( @xcite ) .",
    "heegaard floer homology also detects the thurston norm of a three - manifold ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , knot floer homology detects the genus ( @xcite ) and fiberedness ( @xcite ) of knots and links in the three - sphere .",
    "there is an invariant @xmath12 coming from the knot filtration , whose absolute value gives a lower - bound of the slice genus for knots in the three - sphere ( @xcite ) .    despite its success",
    ", there was no general method to compute the invariants .",
    "there were combinatorial descriptions in certain special cases , but the computation for an arbitrary three - manifold was an open problem ( @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we give an algorithm to compute @xmath2 for a three - manifold @xmath4 , and also @xmath8 for a knot @xmath6 in any three - manifold .",
    "all our computations will be done with coefficients in @xmath13 .",
    "we show that one can always find heegaard diagrams satisfying certain properties ( definition [ defn : nicediagram ] ) .",
    "using such heegaard diagrams , which we call nice , it will be easy to compute @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "in fact , there is an algorithm to convert any pointed heegaard diagram to a nice heegaard diagram via isotopies and handleslides",
    ".    it will be interesting to compare our result with the recent work of ciprian manolescu , peter ozsvth and the first author in @xcite , where they gave a combinatorial description of knot floer homology of knots in @xmath17 , in all versions .",
    "we hope this method can be generalized to compute some of the other versions , notably @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "it would also be nice to have a proof of the invariance of the combinatorial description without using holomorphic disks .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section - prelims ] , we give an overview of certain concepts in heegaard floer theory . in section [ section - holo ] ,",
    "we give a combinatorial characterization of index one holomorphic disks in nice heegaard diagrams . in section [ section - algorithm ] , we give an algorithm to get such heegaard diagrams . in section [ section - examples ] , we give examples to demonstrate our algorithm for three - manifolds and knots in the three - sphere .",

    "the different @xmath29 arcs can not intersect and the different @xmath32 arcs can not intersect , and all intersections between @xmath29 and @xmath32 arcs are transverse .    note that since the preimage of each square region is a square , @xmath176 ( with all the @xmath29 and @xmath32 arcs ) is also tiled by squares .",
    "thus the @xmath29 arcs in @xmath176 can not form a closed loop , for in that case @xmath186\\{inside of loop } has negative euler measure and hence can not be tiled by squares .",

    "this is a contradiction to the embedding assumption near the corners .      in this case",
    "we have an immersion @xmath185 with @xmath176 being a bigon .",
    "again look at the preimage of @xmath29 and @xmath32 circles .",
    "all intersections will be transverse ( call them vertices ) , and at each of the @xmath72 corners there can be only one @xmath29 arc and only one @xmath32 arc .",
    "again there can not be any closed loops .",
    "we get an induced tiling on @xmath176 with squares and @xmath145 bigon .",
    "this time the @xmath29 arcs can ( in fact they have to ) enter and leave @xmath176 through the same @xmath32 arc , but they have to do it in a completely nested fashion , i.e. , there is only one bigon piece in @xmath192 , the  innermost bigon \" .",
    "thus @xmath176 decomposes into two pieces , the innermost bigon and the rest . in case",
