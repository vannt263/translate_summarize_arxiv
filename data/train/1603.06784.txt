    "understanding the structure of wave functions in fock space is a hot topic in many - body physics , intimately related to the concepts of ergodicity and thermalization in complex interacting systems .",
    "the natural way to think of the interaction is as a cause of transitions between single - particle states , which are no longer eigenstates of a quantum system in the presence of interaction .",
    "singe - particle excitations decay into three - particle states ( two electrons and one hole ) , which then further decay into five - particle states , etc .",
    "the simplest way to characterize the process of quantum - mechanical spreading of an excitation in fock space is to study its energy relaxation rate ( inverse lifetime ) .",
    "the study of the inelastic relaxation in a confined geometry has been pioneered by sivan , imry and aronov ( sia ) @xcite , who calculated the quasiparticle lifetime in a diffusive quantum dot with chaotic electron dynamics .",
    "working within the conventional fermi golden rule ( fgr ) picture , they calculated the relaxation rate of an excitation with the energy @xmath5 , induced by the screened coulomb interaction with the small momentum transfer : _ 0 ( ) ~ ^2 ( /)^2 , [ sia ] where @xmath3 is the mean single - particle level spacing in the dot , and @xmath6 is the thouless energy determined by the inverse time of electron diffusion across the system ( @xmath7 is the diffusion coefficient , and @xmath8 is the typical size of the quantum dot ) . for generality , in eq .",
    "( [ sia ] ) we introduced the dimensionless interaction strength @xmath9 , taking its maximal value , @xmath10 , for the screened coulomb potential .",
    "the result ( [ sia ] ) was derived in the hot - electron regime ( negligible temperature , @xmath11 ) under the assumption of the zero - dimensional geometry , @xmath12 .",
    "it provides the diffusive contribution to the relaxation rate originating from the processes with momentum transfer of the order of the inverse system size , @xmath13 .",
    "the total relaxation rate is then the sum of @xmath14 given by eq .",
    "( [ sia ] ) and the fermi - liquid contribution due to the processes with large - momentum transfer , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the fermi energy ) @xcite .",
    "the latter can be neglected for sufficiently large quantum dots , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the fermi momentum , and @xmath19 is the mean free path ) @xcite , that will be assumed thereafter .",
    "remarkably , eq .",
    "( [ sia ] ) derived in the zero - dimensional limit , @xmath12 , shows that in this regime the single - particle spectrum is well resolved , @xmath20 .",
    "though this conclusion is in a good agreement with the experimental results on tunneling spectroscopy of a disordered quantum dot  @xcite , it raises the question of consistency of the derivation .",
    "indeed , the fgr can be safely applied only in the case of continuous spectrum , while the result ( [ sia ] ) implies that it is not .",
    "this subtle point was recognized already by sia , who argued that their approach might be correct as summation over many final states is performed .",
    "this idea was elaborated in a seminal paper by altshuler , gefen , kamenev , and levitov ( agkl ) @xcite , who emphasized that it is the spectrum of final states that should be continuous for the fgr picture to be applicable . in the problem of the hot - electron decay ,",
    "final states are three - particle states with two electrons and one hole , and the corresponding mean level spacing can be estimated as _ 3 ( ) ~^3/^2 .",
    "[ delta3 ] comparing @xmath21 and @xmath22 , agkl came to the conclusion that the fgr description should be valid for sufficiently large energies , @xmath23 , where = g , [ eps * ] and @xmath24 sets the scale , @xmath25 , of the interaction matrix elements ( for the screened coulomb interaction with @xmath10 , @xmath4 coincides with the dimensionless conductance of the dot ) .    in order to study the spreading of a single - particle excitation over the space of many - particle states beyond the fgr approximation , agkl proposed a remarkable mapping of the initial problem to a tight - binding anderson model on a hierarchical lattice , treating each site as a basis vector in the many - particle fock space .",
    "motivated by the observation that the structure of this lattice for the quantum dot problem locally looks like a tree , agkl approximated it by the bethe lattice with a large branching number .",
    "then using the known solution for the anderson model on the bethe lattice @xcite , agkl predicted the localization transition in fock space of an interacting quantum dot at the energy @xmath26 , which appeared to be parametrically smaller than the fgr breaking energy scale @xmath27 .",
    "thus , in the agkl picture of many - body localization one should distinguish between three regimes @xcite . in the localized regime realized at @xmath28 , the slater determinants of one - particle states are very close to the exact many - body states , and the width of quasiparticle states is exactly zero . in the intermediate region , @xmath29",
    ", quasiparticle states are delocalized , but they are strongly fractal and non - ergodic , with the spectral weight given by a number of slightly broadened lines .",
    "the spectral weight acquires a lorentzian form with a well defined width @xmath30 ( corresponding to a simple exponential decay @xmath31 in the time domain ) only in the regime @xmath32 , where the fgr description finally sets in .",
    "the agkl paper has triggered a boost of activity in the field of many - body localization .",
    "the suggested mapping onto the lattice model has been proved to be extremely fruitful : instead of studying an interacting problem one now can deal with a non - interacting quantum mechanics , but on a very complicated lattice with an exponentially large number of sites .",
    "( though all states in a finite system are localized by definition , even an extremely weak coupling to the external reservoir providing a level width larger than the exponentially small distance between the many - body states , which can be estimated as @xmath33 with @xmath34 @xcite , renders the spectrum of delocalized states effectively continuous . )",
    "since the complexity of the problem is encoded in the lattice topology , the crucial point is to identify the relevant features responsible for many - body localization .",
    "quite soon it was recognized that the bethe lattice with a constant branching number is an oversimplified model of fock space .",
    "firstly , the coordination number of the lattice decreases with the number of generations @xcite . secondly , the actual lattice is not a tree , and the presence of loops essentially modifies combinatorics of the perturbative expansion in the localized region @xcite , increasing the agkl estimate for @xmath35 .",
    "numerical studies @xcite demonstrated gradual delocalization with the growth of the quasiparticle energy .",
    "anyway , despite the lack of a rigorous theory of many - body localization in a quantum dot , the general understanding achieved in the beginning of 2000s was that in finite systems one should expect a localization / delocalization crossover , though its position was not firmly established .",
    "later , the concept of many - body localization developed in the quantum dot problem was applied to extended systems of interacting electrons with spatially localized single - particle states @xcite , where the transition between the localized and delocalized many - body phases occurs at a finite temperature .",
    "the related issues of ergodicity and thermalization are currently being actively investigated ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "very recently , many - body localization in a quantum dot was reconsidered by gornyi , mirlin , and polyakov @xcite .",
    "working in the framework of the lattice model , they found an additional factorial contribution in the perturbative series in the number of involved generations , which renders coupling to distant generations less efficient , thus acting in favor of localization .",
    "for the hot - electron decay problem , this leads to the estimate for the threshold energy @xmath36 , which is much larger than the original agkl estimate .",
    "for a thermal many - body state with the temperature @xmath1 and the total energy @xmath37 , the fgr temperature @xmath38 was shown to be logarithmically larger than the localization transition point , @xmath39 .",
    "this result formally coincides with the agkl _ energy _",
    "threshold and is in full agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since , contrary to agkl , refs .  @xcite place the many - body localization threshold @xmath35 for the hot - electron problem above the fgr - breaking scale @xmath27 , one can ask how to reconcile the fgr description with many - body localization .",
    "this question was answered by silvestrov @xcite who studied the temporal decay of a quasiparticle with @xmath32 .",
    "he showed that the fgr relaxation rate @xmath21 describes the initial stage of exponential relaxation , that slows down at larger times due to smaller relaxation rate of descendant states , and eventually due to many - body localization .    in this paper",
    ", we address the initial temporal stage of energy relaxation in a quantum dot , when quantum many - body localization effects are not yet visible . assuming the fgr approach is applicable",
    ", we calculate mesoscopic fluctuations of the energy relaxation rate .",
    "the smallness of fluctuations compared to the average relaxation rate provides an _ a posteriori _  condition for the fgr applicability . in our analysis",
    ", we do not use the lattice model of fock space and work in terms of keldysh diagram technique in real space , where non - perturbative disorder averaging is performed by means of the non - linear supersymmetric sigma model .",
    "such an approach allows us to derive the expression for the variance of the relaxation rate without any simplifications concerning the nature of the electron - electron interaction .",
