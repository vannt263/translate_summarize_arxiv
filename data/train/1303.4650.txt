    "the bending of light due to the large scale structure in the universe is a powerful probe in studying the underlying matter distribution .",
    "this is due in part to the gravitational lensing being insensitive to the type of matter causing the light deflection .",
    "there is the added benefit of lensing being sensitive to the geometry of the universe , making it useful in the study of dark energy @xcite .    to date , almost all cosmic shear analyses have been conducted at optical wavelengths .",
    "however , radio astronomy is currently going through a period of rapid expansion which will make future radio surveys competitive for lensing studies .",
    "new radio telescopes will have sensitivities that will reach a level where the radio emission from ordinary galaxies will be routinely resolved ( e.g. with emerlin , lofar , and eventually ska ; c.f .",
    "@xcite ) ; hence radio source densities will become comparable to those found at optical wavelengths .",
    "also , radio interferometers have a well known and deterministic dirty beam pattern , which may be an advantage in deconvolving galaxy shapes for shear measurements .    with the first survey @xcite",
    ", @xcite made the first detection of cosmic shear with radio data .",
    "this survey has a detection threshold of 1mjy , with @xmath0 resolved sources per square degree useable for weak lensing .",
    "this is a much lower number density than found in deep optical shear surveys , with a correspondingly lower signal - to - noise on the final cosmological constraints .",
    "however , the differential radio source counts at 1.4ghz show an increase at flux densities below 1mjy , ( e.g. @xcite ) , and it is this increase in the number density at the micro - jansky level that makes future radio weak lensing plausible .",
    "the feasibility of weak lensing studies at radio wavelengths , and in particular at the micro - jansky flux levels , was demonstrated in @xcite . due to the low number density of sources used in that work , no significant cosmic signal was detected .",
    "however , an upper bound was obtained on a combination of the cosmological parameters @xmath1 , the normalisation of the matter power spectrum , @xmath2 , the cosmic matter density parameter , and @xmath3 , the median redshift of the sources .",
    "one of the main conclusions of that work was the need for a detailed study of the systematics involved in radio interferometry and the relevant imaging techniques .    in this current paper",
    ", we pursue that study",
    ". we will explore possible systematics which will be important for weak lensing studies with future radio surveys ; for example , the systematics which might be introduced by steps such as the clean algorithm or a poor choice of shape measurement parameters . in tandem , we will quantify our current ability to measure realistic galaxy shapes from simulated radio data , increasing our confidence in current and future radio lensing measurements .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in  [ sims ] we describe the whole of our radio image simulation and shape measurement pipeline .",
    "we describe the shapelets method which is used throughout this work , and how deconvolution works within its framework and the shape estimator we use .",
    "we then describe the shapelets based images that we created as the input for our simulations , before describing how the simulator works to produce realistic radio interferometer images that we use for our analysis .",
    "we also describe the telescope configurations we use in this study , and the observational effects that we consider .    in  [ results ]",
    "we describe the results of our shape measurements on the simulated images .",
    "we assess the appropriate level of cleaning of images , and examine the modelling of point sources and the effect of changing the position on the sky at which images are observed .",
    "we discuss the impact of the shapelet scale parameter in modelling galaxy ellipticities successfully , and the effect of slightly changing the uv sampling .",
    "we then present the main result of the paper : how well we are able to recover the input ellipticities with our shape - measurement method .",
    "we describe how we add realistic noise into the simulations and what effect this has on our results . in ",
    "[ discussion ] we end with a discussion of our results , their limitations , and suitable directions for further study .",
    "the radio image simulation pipeline is built in two parts .",
    "we first create a suite of input images , containing sources which constitute the inputs for the main part of the simulation code .",
    "these input images are then fed into the simulator that ` observes ' and ` images ' them with a given telescope configuration and user defined observation parameters . in this section",
    "we start by briefly describing the shapelets technique of @xcite and @xcite which we use to create the galaxy shapes in our input images ; we will also use shapelet techniques for shape measurement later .",
    "we then describe the creation of the input images before discussing the radio observation pipeline .",
    "the shapelets description of galaxy shapes is based on decomposing an object s surface brightness @xmath4 into a series of localised basis functions @xmath5 , called shapelets : @xmath6 we briefly describe the relevant parts of the method here and refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for a more detailed description .",
    "the basis functions used ( in the cartesian formalism ) @xmath5 , are a localised orthonormal basis set : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the @xmath9 order hermite polynomial , and @xmath10 describes the characteristic scale of the basis .",
    "we will see that this quantity is very important in our psf and galaxy shape analysis .",
    "@xmath11 refers to the order of the basis functions , and in practice all galaxy decompositions are truncated at some order @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 needs to be chosen so that the galaxy model is sufficiently detailed to capture ellipticity information .",
    "as the basis functions are orthogonal , we can find shapelet coefficients for a galaxy by calculating @xmath14 @xcite introduced the closely related polar shapelet formalism ( the polar basis set is an orthogonal transformation of the cartesian set ; see @xcite for details of this transformation ) , which has a different basis set @xmath15 , given by @xmath16!}{\\pi\\left[(n-|m|)/2\\right]!}\\right\\}^{1/2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\theta^{|m|}l^{|m|}_{(n-|m|)/2}\\frac{\\theta^{2}}{\\beta^{2}}e^{-\\theta^{2}/2\\beta^{2}}e^{-im\\phi}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this basis set @xmath17 is the modulus of the complex sky position vector @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 are the associated laguerre polynomial defined as @xmath21 two integers , @xmath22 and @xmath23 uniquely describe every member of the basis set , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the surface brightness of a galaxy @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 the polar basis set has rotational symmetries which are very useful for describing weak lensing , so in practice galaxies are decomposed using the cartesian basis set ( which easily describes square pixels ) and then transformed to the polar set .",
    "both the cartesian and polar shapelet basis functions have simple behaviour under convolution @xcite and deconvolution @xcite , making them particularly well suited for describing and correcting the effects of a psf .",
    "since this is important for our shape measurement analysis , we briefly describe deconvolution in the shapelet framework below .",
    "the approach used in this work for deconvolution is to estimate the deconvolved shapelet coefficients @xmath28 by ` forward convolving ' the shapelet basis function with the psf model @xmath29 , in advance , creating a new basis set which we label @xmath30 with an equivalent expression for the polar shapelet basis functions . fitting the data @xmath31 using this new basis set @xmath32 , one obtains the deconvolved shapelet model for the galaxy as follows : @xmath33\\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_{n_{1},n_{2}}^{\\infty}f_{n_{1},n_{2}}\\left[g(\\mathbf{x})\\ast b_{n_{1},n_{2}}(\\mathbf{x};\\beta)\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_{n_{1},n_{2}}^{\\infty}f_{n_{1},n_{2}}d_{n_{1},n_{2}}(\\mathbf{x};\\beta ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comparing with equation [ eq : decomp ] , the returned coefficients will reconstruct the the deconvolved image when used with the original basis set .",
    "we use the publicly available shapelets software packagerjm / shapelets / code/ ] described in @xcite in order to make shapelet decompositions for all our objects .",
    "this code is well tested using optical data ( c.f . @xcite and @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "we indicated the applicability of this code to radio data with some modifications ; with our radio image simulations , we are now in a position to demonstrate its ability to accurately recover ellipticities in  [ results ] . in all that follows we have used the shapelet equivalent to gaussian weighted quadrupole moments to estimate ellipticities for all our objects . in the polar shapelet convention",
    "this estimator takes the form @xmath34 as is fully discussed in @xcite .      in this section",
    "we describe how the input images are created .",
    "we generate two different sets of input images : the first set contains point sources , consisting of a collection of single illuminated pixels at random locations .",
    "the second suite are images containing detailed galaxy shapes and morphologies , but each with a centroid at the same locations as the point sources in the previous image set .",
    "we will use the point sources to study the behaviour of the dirty beam or point spread function of the telescope .",
    "the galaxy images provide a more realistic challenge , with the goal being to recover the ( known ) shapes of galaxies in the presence of all the systematics that distort them .",
    "the galaxy images are created using the shapelets based formalism described above .",
    "the method of populating the images is based on the @xcite pipeline , which was used as part of the step2 shear methods testing programme @xcite .",
    "the motivation for the use of shapelets galaxy models , as discussed in @xcite , is to simulate deep sky images which include some degree of realistic galaxy morphology .",
    "the procedure used to generate simulated galaxy images in this paper most closely follows that described by @xcite for the generation of simulations of _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) data . using a psf and real noise properties estimated directly from real _ hst _",
    "survey data ( specifically the gems survey : see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , @xcite created realistic simulations of advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) images in the f606w filter .",
    "these were then used to investigate shear and higher order lensing shape measurements in acs data .",
    "as we are simulating radio observations , we do not require a high level of similarity to optical images , in terms of noise , psf or even shape ; in our previous work , @xcite , we found that on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis , optical and radio shapes of galaxies are only weakly correlated .",
    "however , we also showed that the overall distribution of ellipticities in the optical and radio sky were very similar , so we choose to follow the optical distribution of shapelets in this study .",
    "this is a reasonable choice given the current absence of a large observed sample of highly resolved radio objects at @xmath35jy flux density thresholds , which could inform us about the details of the radio shapelet distribution .",
    "a ` starter set ' of galaxy shapelet models was created using shapelet decompositions of gems images , modelled according to @xcite using a spatially and temporally varying model of the acs psf .",
    "the temporal variation of each shapelet coefficient in an @xmath36 model of the psf was modelled in three epochs as described by @xcite , using a third order polynomial surface to describe the spatial variation on each acs chip .",
    "the resulting psf - deconvolved shapelet models are then sampled from to produce the simulated galaxy images .",
    "when creating the simulated galaxies from the starter set , the models are randomly rotated and/or inverted to eradicate any remaining signature of gravitational lensing .",
    "we also note that the starter set represents a large but ultimately limited sample of galaxy morphologies .",
    "this is alleviated by introducing small random perturbations to the shapelet models ( see @xcite & @xcite for details ) .",
    "using this prescription , a suite of 100 images of size @xmath37 pixels with a pixel scale of @xmath38 were created .",
    "we have constructed these images such that all the sources ( galaxies and point sources ) were at a constant flux .",
    "galaxies have been assigned the same flux , as the process of calibration should in principle remove all brighter galaxies in a radio image .",
    "the brighter galaxies furthermore will be present in smaller numbers per square arcmin , and hence produce less side lobe noise .",
    "therefore it is the galaxies which are at the sensitivity limit of the survey which will dominate the side lobe contribution to the image .",
    "we could have produced a simulation with a luminosity function , but this is unknown at the faintest magnitude limits , so the approximation we have made should suffice .",
    "we also inspected the relationship between the @xmath10 values of the simulated galaxies , derived from gems , and the @xmath10 parameters that were derived from the shapelet modelling of the actual radio sources in @xcite .",
    "it was found that the distribution of the @xmath10 parameters from the best - fitting shapelet models of the gems data had a systematically lower value @xmath39 than the radio shapelet models from @xcite ( @xmath40 for the silver catalogue in that work ) . to make the simulations a more realistic representation of radio data",
    "we therefore add 0.185@xmath41 to the @xmath10 scale parameter for our galaxy models ; these then provide a close match to the distribution of the derived @xmath10 values from @xcite .    for each image , we have a corresponding catalogue containing the input shapelet coefficients of each source in the image , as well as the centroid of the objects .",
    "an example of one of our images containing galaxies is shown in figure [ fig : simeg ] .    ]",
    "we note that these images represent an ambitious imaging scenario , as they are very densely populated fields representing deep pointings .",
    "the input images contain a number density of @xmath42 arcmin@xmath43 , which is far larger than current lensing studies , even those in space .",
    "the reason for setting this high number density is to probe systematic errors related to radio interferometers deriving from both the instrumental setup and the radio imaging pipeline .",
    "while a large number of point sources allows one to better probe the dirty beam behaviour across the field , a larger number density in the galaxies means a more challenging imaging problem , since sidelobe noise will be greater in densely packed images .",
    "note that the simulated galaxies have not been sheared ; in this analysis we are not concerned with trying to recover a cosmic shear signal from galaxies ; rather , we are examining how well we can recover known input ellipticities , which is the basis for recovering such a signal .",
    "having described the details of the input images , we now describe the details of our simulated configurations .",
    "we aim to create observations from radio arrays of our choice , including imaging steps such as dirty beam deconvolution and visibility weighting , in order to create realistic restored images .",
    "our simulation pipeline is implemented using the meqtrees software system .",
    "meqtrees is a software package for implementing the measurement equation for radio interferometers and is fully described in and .",
    "the heart of a measurement equation is formed by the @xmath44 jones matrices @xcite which describes the various effects associated with observations that can corrupt the measured visibilities .",
    "the formulation for a generic radio interferometer measurement equation ( rime ) was developed by , after preparatory work by @xcite .",
    "then recast the formalism into @xmath44 matrix form which is used within meqtrees mueller matrices @xcite , which are entirely equivalent . ] .",
    "the rime provides an elegant mathematical framework for generic radio instruments , both existing and future , to be better understood , simulated and calibrated . for a full description of the mathematical formalism for the measurement equation of interferometers",
    "we refer the reader to , and references therein .",
    "the meqtrees software was originally designed to implement the measurement equations for the purposes of simulation and calibrating .",
    "we use meqtrees in this work to simulate the sky as would be observed by a specific radio interferometer.the galaxy images created above are fed into the meqtrees simulator , which calculates observed visibilities ; these visibilities are then imaged .",
    "the user can specify many options such as the level of noise on the visibilities , the specific method used to deconvolve the dirty beam , and the weighting scheme applied to the visibility data prior to imaging .",
    "one subtlety is that the input in our work is an image rather than a set of visibilities . in order to obtain @xmath45 samples from the image",
    ", we use a module of the meqtrees software that implements a ` de - gridding ' algorithm .",
    "this algorithm is an interpolation scheme that allows one to transform between the regularly gridded image and a sparsely sampled fourier ( or @xmath45 ) plane .",
    "the details of how this algorithm work is explained fully in @xcite .",
    "the well known relationship between observed visibilities and the true sky brightness for an interferometer is given by : @xmath46 equation [ eq : simvis ] should also include the _ sampling function _",
    "term , @xmath47 on the left hand side .",
    "the sampling function accounts for the fact that the visibilities are collected at a set of discrete locations in the @xmath45 plane .",
    "its functional form is simply a linear combination of dirac delta functions at all @xmath48 where data is collected .",
    "the fourier inversion of equation [ eq : simvis ] leads to the _ dirty image _ , which is the convolution between the sampling function ( in the image plane ) and true sky brightness .",
    "since direct fourier transforms become computationally expensive with large datasets , fast fourier transforms ( ffts ) need to be used .",
    "although the use of ffts speeds up computations , it requires that we grid the data .",
    "the process by which this de - gridding is done , and its implication for the recovered image is described in @xcite .",
    "the meqtrees software employs the use of prolate spheroidal functions in the de - gridding process , which have been shown to reduce the effect of aliasing @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : simpipeline ] we illustrate the simulation setup from start to finish .",
    "( note that in this work we have focused on one particular method of deconvolution of the dirty beam , namely the clean algorithm , which we shall describe in section [ sec : clean ] ) .",
    "we start with an image that is fourier transformed to create the set of simulated visibilities .",
    "these are then modified by the rime formalism for our given set of parameters to create a set of visibilities as observed by our given array .",
    "these visibilities are fourier transformed again to produce the dirty image , which is then cleaned as our setup defines to produce the clean component image . the residual of the dirty image is then added to the clean components once convolved with the clean beam ( usually an elliptical gaussian measured from the main lobe of the dirty beam ) .",
    "the final step involves convolving the cleaned image with the clean beam .",
    "the clean beam is usually a gaussian fitted to the main lobe of the psf and it is this final beam that the point source simulations will characterise .",
    "this is also what we shall deconvolve from the galaxies to produce our final images from which the shapes of our sources will be measured .          in this section",
    "we describe the different experiments we have carried out to examine a variety of potential causes of systematic effects .",
    "we choose to concentrate on two specific interferometers : emerlin and lofar .",
    "the emerlin array is an upgrade to the existing merlin array , maintaining the same number of dishes .",
    "the emerlin array upgrade is designed to increase sensitivity by more than an order of magnitude by using new receivers and telescope electronics .",
    "the array spans 217 km , with observing bands at 1.3 - 1.8 ghz , 4 - 8 ghz and 22 - 24 ghz , with a total bandwidth of 4 ghz .",
    "it also has resolution capabilities of between 10 - 150 mas and sensitivity of @xmath49jy .",
    "lofar is a new generation radio interferometer , with the ultimate goal of surveying the universe at low frequencies with high resolution and sensitivity .",
    "it operates in the less explored low frequency range of 10 - 250 mhz .",
    "lofar belongs to a new generation of telescopes , with the concept of utilising many inexpensive dipole antennae arranged in stations without any moving parts , in contrast to the usual notion of radio dishes as used by emerlin .",
    "different parts of the sky are observed by steering the beam electronically .",
    "the spatial resolution of the netherlands part of the array is governed by the @xmath50 km baselines , leading to a resolution of a few arc minutes at 240 mhz .",
    "the lofar array has now been extended over europe , with stations in the uk , germany , sweden and france .",
    "these europe wide baselines reach @xmath51 km , leading to sub - arcsecond resolution above 100 mhz . in our study",
    "we include these larger , europe - wide baselines .    for both arrays we create two different measurement sets ( mss )",
    "centred on a fixed ra @xmath52 , but with differing dec @xmath53 and dec @xmath54 .",
    "a measurement set is a specific definition of how visibility data is stored , designed to be compatible with the measurement equation formalism . for our purposes we can think of it as a large table containing information about the particular observation in question . for the emerlin mss",
    "we use a central frequency @xmath55 ghz while for the corresponding lofar mss we use a central frequency @xmath56 mhz . in both cases",
    "we set our bandwidth specifications to 128 channels each of 125 khz resulting in a 16 mhz bandwidth .",
    "we have also employed a 20 sec time averaging over a 24 hour observation .",
    "the @xmath45 coverage corresponding to these four mss are shown in figure [ fig : uvcoverage ] .",
    "we use the meqtrees imager to create restored ( deconvolved ) images for these telescope configurations .",
    "we image an area twice the size of the original input image , and use a portion of this extra image to estimate the rms of the residuals as described below .",
    "our default imaging option uses the clark clean deconvolution algorithm ; we shall describe below how we estimate the number of clean components used for each simulation . in creating the restored images",
    "we have kept our pixel scale the same as that of the original input images , @xmath38 .    in some runs of the analysis",
    "we do not include measurement noise ( i.e. the visibilities are not corrupted in any way ) .",
    "clearly this is unrealistic , but allows us to distinguish between systematic effects and noise effects .",
    "once we have analysed these noise - free images , we explore the effect of adding measurement noise to see what effect that has on our results .",
    "below we list and briefly discuss the telescope effects we study in this work .",
    "we have created mss for both arrays observing at differing declination angles to examine what effect this has on our shape measurements .",
    "it can be shown that the equation for the ellipse traced in the @xmath45 plane by a particular baseline is given by @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the coordinate separations between the two antennae and @xmath59 is the declination of the phase tracking centre ( usually where the field - of - view is centred ) . as the interferometer observes a point on the celestial sphere , the rotation of the earth causes the @xmath60 and @xmath61 components of the baseline to trace out an elliptical locus according to this equation .    since the sampling function is effectively a collection of these elliptical loci ( c.f .",
    "figure [ fig : uvcoverage ] ) , we see that it depends on the declination of the observation and the antenna spacings .",
    "the sampling function , as already mentioned , determines the psf ( or dirty beam ) for the experiment .",
    "our different declination observations give us the means to see how the variation of the sampling function ( measured from the point sources ) affects the recovered galaxy shape distributions .",
    "we have mentioned above the fourier relationship between the observed visibilities and the desired sky intensity .",
    "we discussed how the fft of the visibilities leads to an estimate of the dirty image , which is the sky brightness convolved with the sampling function . in order to obtain an estimate of the sky intensity we need some way to perform a deconvolution .",
    "the commonly used algorithm clean is one way to perform this deconvolution .",
    "devised by it assumes that the radio sky can be represented by a collection of point sources ( clean components ) in an otherwise empty field .",
    "the intensity distribution @xmath62 is then approximated by superposition of these point sources which have a positive intensity @xmath63 , at the locations @xmath64 .",
    "the clean algorithm then aims to determine @xmath65 such that @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the dirty image that is obtained from the inversion of the visibilities , @xmath68 is the dirty beam which is the inverted sampling function and , @xmath69 is the residual brightness distribution . the approximation is deemed to have been successful if this residual noise is similar to that of the measured visibilities .",
    "this decomposition can not be analytically computed and an iterative approach is required .    the original clean algorithm is applied entirely in the image plane .",
    "it uses a simple iterative procedure to find the position and strengths of the sources in the dirty image , from which a dirty beam multiplied by the peak strength is subtracted .",
    "all positions where this occurs are recorded as well as the corresponding peak flux .",
    "the procedure stops when all remaining peaks fall below some specified level .",
    "the recorded positions and fluxes constitute the point source model , which is then convolved with the idealised clean beam ( usually the central lobe of the dirty beam ) and the residuals from the dirty image are added to produce the final , deconvolved image .",
    "we refer the reader to and @xcite for further details .",
    "our imaging pipeline can implement a variety of clean algorithms ; in this paper we choose a widely used version , the clark clean , which efficiently implements the algorithm and can provide improved speed for larger images .",
    "it is important for us to study the effect of the clean method ( and the process of deconvolution as a whole ) on shape measurement .",
    "although clean is well tested and appropriate for many imaging applications , it is non - linear and does not necessarily converge in a well - defined manner .",
    "it is not immediately clear if it is suitable for the purpose of shape measurement as required for weak lensing ; we will test this in the next section .      in creating the mss ,",
    "we have examined 2 different sampling configurations .",
    "as described above , our default mss were created using a regularly sampled @xmath45 coverage by sampling a 24 hour observation every 20 seconds .",
    "further to this we created an irregularly sampled @xmath45 coverage by sampling a 1000 hour observation every 20 minutes .",
    "this provides a similar density of visibility samples to the previous configuration , but these samples are not uniformly spaced along the tracks .",
    "although this particular configuration is unlikely to arise in a normal observation , irregular sampling of the @xmath45 plane can come from , for example , data flagging at some given interval . since the @xmath45 coverage determines the psf , which we know to be important for weak lensing studies , it is useful to see if the results are sensitive to the sampling configuration .",
    "in this section we present the results from the shape measurement analyses of both point sources and galaxies .",
    "we firstly address the question of how many clean components are required to adequately represent these images .",
    "we then examine the behaviour of point source ellipticities , for different telescope configurations and declinations .",
    "next we assess the modelling of galaxy shapes , in relation to the shapelet scale parameter and uv sampling .",
    "all this is in preparation for the main result of the paper , which is the presentation of whether output ellipticity estimates are in line with true input ellipticities .",
    "finally , we discuss the impact of realistic noise on the measurement of ellipticity .",
    "we aim to find the lowest number of components that suitably deconvolve the sources in the images , since this reduces computation time and avoids fitting noise . to assess this issue",
    ", we set several different target numbers of clean components on one of the images from our set of simulations .",
    "we ran this experiment on all four mss with the point sources and the galaxies .",
    "since the point sources have a much simpler set of source structures , it would be expected that they would require fewer clean iterations .",
    "we examine the residuals ( of the dirty image ) in order to compare the relative merits of the different numbers of clean components used .",
    "we examine where we find the minimum rms residuals as a function of number of clean iterations .",
    "we image the residuals just outside the patch where we have sources in order to estimate the residual side lobe noise from the sources inside the central part of the image . to estimate the rms of the residuals , we select a frame around the inner image containing the sources , with a width 16 pixels @xmath70 which we split into 20 cells , from which we calculate a mean rms . in figure",
    "[ fig : clean ] we show how the mean point source and galaxy rms residuals vary with the number of clean components for each of our mss .",
    "we wish to perform our analyses on the images with the smallest rms residuals . for the point source images ,",
    "the lowest tested number of clean components , @xmath71 , has smallest rms , and we adopt this value for point source analysis . we see that in the emerlin galaxy simulations there is a minimum in the rms residuals near @xmath72 , while for the lofar cases the minimum lies near @xmath73 ; these are the iteration numbers that we have adopted for galaxies in the rest of this paper .",
    "we note that these values are not dependent on the declination of the observations .",
    "since the images we create have known source positions , we bypass the source extraction stage of a lensing analysis .",
    "we instead use sextractor in the assoc mode whereby we input a catalogue of positions where objects are known to lie .",
    "of course , even in this mode we will only detect objects which meet the internal requirements to be classified as an object .",
    "we use the default sextractor settings of table [ tab : sexsettings ] ; with these settings we find that we are able to detect @xmath74 of the objects that are in the original images , with detected number densities ranging from @xmath75 arcmin@xmath43 .",
    ".table summarising main sextractor parameters .",
    "[ tab : sexsettings ] [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      coverage . also shown ( bottom ) is the difference between the two psfs .",
    "[ fig:20minsecpsfs ] ]      the simulations above contain background fluctuations due to side - lobes , but do not contain measurement noise on the visibilities ; we now consider the addition of this noise to the simulations . within meqtrees ,",
    "the required input is the standard deviation of the gaussian from which the noise for each visibility datum is drawn . for this test",
    "we restrict ourselves to the lofar dec @xmath76 measurement set .",
    "to assess the noise levels in the image plane corresponding to the noise input parameter in the meqtrees software , we write the total noise @xmath77 in an image as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is noise associated with side lobes ( which is present even in the absence of measurement noise ) and @xmath80 is the contribution arising from the corruption of the visibilities .",
    "we use the noise - free simulations described in the previous section to estimate the @xmath79 term , and we run test simulations with varying noise in the visiblilities to estimate the @xmath77 terms . hence we can estimate the @xmath80 terms using the equation above .",
    "we find that the relationship between the measured @xmath80 and the visibility noise is linear , and calibrate the chosen level of noise accordingly .",
    "we calculate the snr of each object in the image by measuring the flux density in an aperture of 0.75@xmath41 around its known position , and dividing through by the total noise @xmath77 integrated in the aperture .",
    "we choose the noise level such that our objects have snr @xmath81 ; this is the level to which weak lensing measurements might plausibly be made .",
    "we found that in meqtrees parameter units , a choice of 20 for the visibility noise creates an image where the mean of the snr distribution of the objects is @xmath82 , and this is the value that we adopted .    with this choice of visibility noise",
    "we carry out the same procedure as before .",
    "we first determine how many clean components we need to sufficiently deconvolve the beam , by running a similar test to the noise free case , the result of which is shown in figure [ fig : noisecleans ] .     case . [",
    "fig : noisecleans ] ]    we find that there is a different behaviour to that seen in the noise free case ( c.f .",
    "figure [ fig : clean ] ) .",
    "we see that there is a reduction in the residuals as we increase the number of clean components ; at high numbers of components , both the point source and galaxy rms flattens out . in our noise free simulations we adopted a value of @xmath83 and @xmath84 clean components for point sources and galaxies respectively for this ms",
    "we see that with the addition of noise , point sources require more cleaning than before , while for the galaxies @xmath84 iterations still seems sufficient .",
    "we do not find a minimum in the rms residuals for either the point sources or the galaxies , but since after @xmath73 there is only slow reduction , this is the value we have chosen .",
    "the choice will be vindicated if there is good correlation between measured and input ellipticities .",
    "we now consider the noisy point source shape measurements .",
    "we perform a similar analysis for the shapelet modelling as in section [ sec : point ] to find a good choice for the @xmath10 parameter .",
    "we decompose all the sources using the shapelet optimisation algorithm as well as using our fixed @xmath10 and @xmath13 approach .",
    "again , we use a fixed @xmath85 and use @xmath10 values of 1 , 1.5 and 2 pixels . we show the corresponding results in figure [ fig : noisedelhists ] .",
    ", for the noisy lofar dec @xmath76 case .",
    "red curves correspond to the shapelet optimisation algorithm of @xcite , and the yellow , blue and green curves correspond to decompositions done with fixed @xmath85 and @xmath86 pixels respectively .",
    "the solid lines show @xmath87 and the dashed show @xmath88 .",
    "[ fig : noisedelhists ] ]    immediately we note that the addition of noise has broadened out the ellipticity distributions in contrast to those measured in figure [ fig : delhists ] .",
    "as before , we find that fixing the @xmath10 parameter seems to produce a cleaner measurement than the standard shapelet optimisation algorithm , and we see again that a choice of @xmath89 pixels produces the most tightly peaked histogram .",
    "we again adopt this value for @xmath10 and an @xmath85 in our modelling of the point sources and the psf .",
    "we use the estimated psf to deconvolve the noisy galaxies . from the previous section",
    ", we expect that the @xmath10 parameter choice for the galaxies is important , so we shapelet - decompose the galaxies with a variety of @xmath10 choices . as before we find a strong @xmath10 dependence when we examine how the measured ellipticities compare to the input ellipticities , as shown in figure [ fig : noisebeta ] , again we only show the smallest and largest error bars for clarity . similarly to the noise - free case , we find that fixing @xmath10 to 0.2 @xmath90 estimate yields the best results for @xmath23 when we compare the measured and input ellipticities .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : noisegals ] our final result of comparing the input and measured ellipticities in our noisy lofar dec @xmath76 simulation , also summarised in table [ tab : gals ] as lofar ( n ) .",
    "we find that the addition of the visibility noise has degraded our slope measurement to @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "while this represents an increase in the calibration bias over the noise - free case , the calibration bias remains at a modest 10% level .",
    "in this paper , we have made an exploratory study of a radio imaging pipeline suitable for studying weak gravitational lensing , and have tested a shear measurement pipeline which has been adapted for radio data . using our simulations ,",
    "we can obtain a better understanding of suitable shear measurement techniques to use with emerlin , lofar and ultimately the ska .",
    "we have constructed a pipeline to simulate current and future weak lensing observations with radio interferometers .",
    "we were motivated by @xcite in which we attempted to measure a weak lensing signal using radio data from merlin and vla . in that work",
    "we found systematic contamination in the data ; indeed , a primary conclusion of that work was the need for a detailed study of the systematics involved in trying to measure weak lensing using radio datasets .",
    "in the current work , we have been able to assess some of the possible systematics , and have demonstrated the reliability of our shape measurement method on realistic simulated radio images .    using the shapelets method",
    "we have created a set of images containing a collection of point sources and realistic galaxy shapes .",
    "the point sources were used to probe the behaviour of the beam , while the galaxies were used to test how well one can recover known ellipticities in the presence of a radio data reduction and imaging pipeline .",
    "the ` true ' images were run through our simulator to mimic observations made with the emerlin and lofar arrays , at two different declinations , and with different numbers of clean iterations .",
    "we measured ellipticities for galaxies via a shapelets decomposition , including deconvolution of the psf .",
    "as in our previous analysis , we have found that best results with shapelet decomposition were obtained by fixing the @xmath13 and @xmath10 parameters .",
    "the galaxy simulations showed a very strong @xmath10 dependance when we compared their true and measured ellipticities ; we found that @xmath93 fwhm gave the most faithful galaxy ellipticities .",
    "given our best shapelet models , we were then able to compare the true and measured ellipticities in our catalogues .",
    "we found highly correlated results , with all four mss having pearson correlation coefficients close to one .",
    "all mss showed no evidence for an additive bias to the ellipticity measurements , and showed a modest ( @xmath81% ) multiplicative bias .",
    "we added measurement noise to our simulations , fixing the visibility noise so that the resulting galaxies had a snr distribution peaking at snr @xmath94 . in this case",
    ", we found similar results for the shapelet ellipticity measurements as with the simulations only containing side - lobe noise ; the multiplicative bias for ellipticity measurement remains at the 10% level .",
    "these results are encouraging since they suggest that we can already recover well the true shape of sources from radio data , with well - motivated choices for the number of cleans , and the shapelet scale size .",
    "given further studies of systematics effects , we hope to further reduce the calibration bias .    in this work",
    "we have demonstrated the feasibility of making weak lensing measurements in the presence of realistic features of radio observations .",
    "clearly , there are important extensions to what has been explored here :    * in this study we have confined ourselves to small scale images , in order to clean in a reasonably short time .",
    "ithe image size needs to be upscaled in order to probe position dependent psf effects .",
    "* we have restricted ourselves to one clean algorithm ; the performance of a range of deconvolution techniques should be tested .",
    "* we have used a uniform weighting scheme ; weighting this way should maximise the contribution from the longer baselines , resulting in better resolution images . natural weighting also exists , which give more sensitive images .",
    "weak lensing is unique in that it requires both sensitivity and high angular resolution images ; there are weighting schemes that try to find a compromise between these two criteria ( e.g. briggs weighting , @xcite ) .",
    "assessing the shape measurement improvement / degradation between uniform , natural and intermediate weighting , and comparing this to any increase / decrease in source counts will be valuable . * in our construction of the mss",
    "we have used particular frequency and time averaging configurations ; these can dramatically increase / decrease the size of the ms . examining how different frequency and time averaging configurations affect shear estimates",
    "is a further important line of enquiry . *",
    "in this work we have used the shapelet method for shape measurement .",
    "the use of the shapelets method for radio data is well motivated , particularly by the fourier invariance of the shapelet basis functions and the possibility of shape measurement directly in the @xmath45 plane .",
    "however , in weak lensing , there are a considerable number of methods for shape measurement , see for example @xcite .",
    "exploration of radio weak lensing should include a study of how these existing methods fare with radio image simulations .",
    "in this analysis we have demonstrated an approach to weak lensing measurements at radio wavelengths ; encouragingly we have seen that our shape measurement methods and deconvolution techniques provide us with shape measurements that are only modestly biased .",
    "we have pointed out several open questions that still remain to be answered in this field , some of which this pipeline should be able to answer . these simulations can be extended to simulate actual weak lensing fields , where the input images contain realistic lensing shear , and we can assess how well we recover a cosmic signal .",
    "there are a range of new radio facilities that are / will be capable of producing data with which weak lensing measurements will be made .",
    "understanding the relevant systematics , and knowing how well shape - measurement methods perform , is an important step towards using arrays such as a full europe - wide lofar , and ultimately the ska , for weak lensing .",
