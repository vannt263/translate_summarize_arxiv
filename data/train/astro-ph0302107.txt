    "the survey covers 92% of the sky in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band ; the rass sources are complete down to a pspc countrate of 0.05 c / s , which corresponds to a flux of 5.4  assuming an unabsorbed power - law spectrum of photon index @xmath6 ( or a flux of 2 assuming @xmath7 ) .",
    "these efforts searched for error boxes which are `` empty '' of off - band counterparts .",

    "the x - ray to optical ratio of a thermal spectrum ins is roughly @xcite : @xmath8    which is orders of magnitude larger than for other known x - ray source classes ; for example , stars typically have @xmath9/@xmath10 , agn are @xmath00.1 - 10 , and white dwarfs and x - ray binaries are typically 10100 , but can be as high as 1000 . to date , three bright inss have been optically detected near their expected flux level @xcite .",
    "no identified ins has exhibited intensity variability on any timescale .    the predictions for the number of inss to be detected contrast with only seven such objects reported so far @xcite .",

    ".      the observational problem of discovering inss ( for a recent review , see ) from the rass / bsc is severely hampered by source confusion @xcite . for example , the average number of optical sources in the usno - a2 catalog in a 3@xmath1 uncertainty region of a rass / bsc source is @xmath03 , and is often much greater in the galactic plane . however , at such source densities , an arcsec localization which places the x - ray source coincident with an off - band counterpart results in a probability of random alignment of @xmath110.3% . thus , an arcsec localization coincident with an optical source in the usno - a2 argues for association , with a probability of spurious association at the level of 0.3% . for the faintest x - ray sources in the rass / bsc ,",
    "the implied @xmath12 for the faintest optical sources in usno - a2 is @xmath0few  comparable to what is expected for agn ( 0.1 - 10 ) . at higher optical fluxes , the values of @xmath12 approach that of stellar coronae (  ) .",
    "previous ins searches took the following approach in identifying new inss : ( 1 ) examine off - band source catalogs , images , or spectroscopic surveys for objects which are spatially close to the x - ray source position ; ( 2 ) all such off - band sources are individually evaluated to be either a plausible counterpart or not ; ( 3 ) if a plausible counterpart is found , the x - ray source is considered identified as a class which is not an ins .",
    "this approach is a reasonable means for searching for inss .",
    "however , none of the previous works quantitatively assess their confusion rate  specifically : if an ins were placed in one of their fields , what is the probability that they would mis - identify it with a plausible , but incorrect , counterpart ?    while the discovered inss place a lower - limit on the number of inss in the sky , the upper - limit on inss in the sky can not be quantified without knowing the probability of mis - identification .",
    "we therefore question the reliability of upper - limits derived from these works .",
    "this statistical question is the basis upon which all conclusions regarding the ins population rests @xcite .",
    "n99 hereafter ) examined the observed log n - log s curve of inss , to compare the relative contribution to this curve of inss powered by bondi - hoyle accretion from the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) vs. those powered by cooling from their recent ( @xmath3 yr ) sne . citing previous work @xcite , n99 estimated a 2% mis - identification rate ; however , we find no quantitative support for this estimation in any of the cited works .",

    "point source catalog ( v. 2.0 ) contains @xmath0250,000 objects .",
    "we use the ir source position , positional uncertainty , and the 12 @xmath13 m flux density for source flux .",
    "the position was taken as the source centroid ( precessed from b1950.0 to j2000.0 using the idl routine jprecess from the astro package ) , and the positional uncertainty was taken as the major axis of the elliptical positional uncertainties . * the united states naval observatory a2.0 ( usno - a2 ) catalog contains @xmath145 optical sources , found by scanning optical plates from the palomar all sky survey ( poss - i ) at @xmath15 , and from the science research council @xmath16 ( src - j ) and european southern observatory ( eso - r ) survey at declinations below that .",
    "we make use of the optical source position , positional uncertainty , and quoted @xmath17 magnitude .",
    "the positional uncertainty of the usno - a2  catalog is generally @xmath00.25 , although for objects brighter than 11 magnitude , which saturate the plates , the astrometry is accurate to @xmath142 .",
    "we adopted 1  as the positional uncertainty for each optical source .",
    "based upon an initial investigation , we considered only usno - a2  sources which were @xmath375  from the x - ray source position .",
    "the photometric accuracy is estimated as internally 0.15 mag , with systematic errors of 0.25 - 0.50 magnitudes ) ; however , for our purposes , this is of sufficient accuracy to be useful .",
    "we excluded objects with @xmath18 from consideration .",
    "the approach is described in detail for a cross - association with a single catalog ( usno - a2 ) elsewhere @xcite . here , we summarize the relevant descriptive elements for the present multi - catalog analysis which produced the initial candidate ins source list .    as we are limited to declinations @xmath19 ( the lower - limit of nvss ) we have a total of 15,205 rass / bsc sources .",
    "first , we collect all sources in the three off - band catalogs which are within 150  ( except for usno - a2 , where we use 75 ) from the rass / bsc positions . for each x - ray source @xmath20 and off - band source @xmath21 pair",
    "we calculate a figure of merit @xmath22 using a function which is particular to the off - band source catalog @xmath23 :      where @xmath25 is the separation between the x - ray source and the catalog object ; @xmath26 is the uncertainty in @xmath25 , found by summing the quadrature of the uncertainty in the x - ray position and the off - band catalog object position ( taking the largest uncertainty in the case of nvss , where the uncertainties are typically elliptical ) ; and @xmath27 is the fraction of sources in catalog @xmath23 ( actually , in the `` background fields '' , see below ) with greater fluxes than observed from source @xmath21 .",
    "in addition to using the single - object catalogs alone , we combined objects in groups of up to three ( singles , doubles and triples ) , so that new `` complex '' catalogs of multi - source objects were used .",
    "for example : we formed complex catalogs of usno - a2/usno - a2 , usno - a2/iras , usno - a2/nvss , nvss / nvss and so - on , producing a total of six `` doubles '' catalogs . for each double - object , the value of @xmath28 is the product of the individual objects which make up the double - object ; if one usno - a2 source had lr=5 , and a second had lr=2 , then the lr for the `` complex '' object comprised of both sources had lr=20 ; and similarly for triple - objects .",
    "we then use 24 off - source positions ( the `` background fields '' ) , offset in a 5@xmath295 grid with separations of 300  and radii of 150(except usno - a2 , where we use 75 ) .",
    "we exclude background fields which contain rass / bsc sources .",
    "we calculate @xmath30 for those `` pairs '' using now the center of the blank fields as the x - ray `` source '' position .",
    "then , we calculate a `` reliability '' r for each pair @xmath31 :      where @xmath33 is the number of objects in the source fields which had a value @xmath28 within a @xmath34 of that obtained for the pair @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the same , but in background fields . the value @xmath37 is a pure probability  the probability that the candidate counterpart @xmath21 is not a background object , but is associated with the x - ray source in some way ( and not necessarily as the x - ray emitter ) .",
    "@xmath37 is independent of the source catalog @xmath23 or the nature of the object @xmath21 , and so we now can mix the values of @xmath37 for the same x - ray source @xmath20 to produce the probability that off - band source @xmath21 is associated with the x - ray source exclusive of other off - band sources in the field :              when @xmath42 is close to 1 , none of the off - band objects in the field have properties which demonstrate a statistical excess in x - ray fields over background fields  that is , the off - band objects in the field are beyond the confusion limit . as found previously @xcite , typical uncertainties in the values of  and",
    "are @xmath02% .",
    "in performing this analysis , we also inserted 150 `` control '' sources among the source fields , set randomly about the sky in proportion to the local x - ray source density within our survey area .",
    "these act as a control experiment  since they are not real sources , they will have no detectable off - band counterparts in the all - sky catalogs , just as for inss .",
    "this permits us to evaluate the efficiency with which our statistical selection will identify real inss .",
    "of the 150 `` control '' sources , 29 were found with @xmath430.90 by this procedure ; the remaining 80% of the control sources had @xmath30.90 , due to confusion with nearby optical sources .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : control]a , we show the spatial distribution of the control fields in galactic coordinates . in fig .  [",
    "fig : control]b , we show the 29 fields found with @xmath430.90 .",
    "while the control fields are evenly distributed about the sky in our survey region , the `` found '' fields clearly avoid the galactic plane .",
    "this is due to the fact that so many optical point sources populate the plane , that the fields are confused with spurious ( low significance ) sources ( fig .",
    "[ fig : control]c ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : control]d , we show the cumulative distribution @xmath44 of the control sources with @xmath430.90 , in comparison with one expected from an equal area distribution in @xmath45 ( taking into account the declination constraint for our survey area , which makes a difference only at the @xmath0few percent level in the cumulative distribution ) .",
    "note that no control fields are found with @xmath46 . using a k - s test @xcite",
    ", the detected control sources are inconsistent with an equal area distribution ( ks probability of prob@xmath47=3 ) , which we attribute to source confusion in the galactic plane .",
    "modeling the absent sources as a correction of @xmath48 , we find 90% confidence limits on @xmath49 of 1.25 - 3.8 , with a best value of @xmath50 .",
    "we began with objects for which @xmath51 ( 60 objects ) . from these , we excluded all objects in which the rass / bsc hardness ratio hr1 indicated an effective temperature @xmath43200 ev ( 28 sources ) , which are too spectrally hard to be cooling or bondi - accreting inss . in the rass / bsc ,",
    "hr1 is defined in the usual fashion ( = ( b - a)/(b+a ) ) , where b is the number of counts detected in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band , and a is the number of counts detected in the 0.1 - 0.4 kev band ) , and we require hr@xmath430 .",
    "because bondi - accreting or cooling inss are expected to have lower effective temperatures than 200 ev , we expect to lose no inss from this cut ( previously known inss also have effective temperatures @xmath3200 ev ) .",

    "two more , as we stated above , have a @xmath01 , such that they would have been included in our sample for _ chandra _  observations .",
    "this lends confidence that our approach is capable of selecting inss , although  as expected  source confusion hampers discovery .",

    "the fact that all x - ray sources detected with _",

    "the present approach demonstrates the capability of statistical cross - identification techniques applied using all - sky - surveys @xcite .",
    "its advantage over previous approaches of examining individual x - ray sources and their nearby off - band counterparts is that we can `` monte - carlo '' the sky , and quantitatively state selection efficiency for inss . as such , we are also able to examine the weakness of this approach , and design a superior experiment , which will improve on the present limit .",
    "improvement on the present limit on the number of inss requires primarily a more efficient means of statistical identification of inss , and not substantial numbers of new arcsec localizations of reasonable ins candidates in the rass / bsc .",
    "for example , if we had observed all 32 ( spectrally soft ) ins candidates with _",
    "chandra _ , and there were no new inss , this would lower the 90% limit from 56 to 34 inss , an improvement of a factor of @xmath01.6 . however , if our identification efficiency had been 80% instead of 20% but everything else being the same ( including having 13 `` undetermined '' sources ) , our 90% confidence upper - limit would now be @xmath39  comparable to the number known  instead of @xmath356 , an improvement of a factor of @xmath05.6 , which would not have required any more observations than we undertook for the present analysis .",

    "<S> the challenge in searching for non - radio - pulsing isolated neutron stars ( inss ) is in excluding association with objects in the very large error boxes ( @xmath013 , 1@xmath1 radius ) typical of sources from the largest x - ray all - sky survey , the _ rosat_all - sky - survey / bright source catalog ( rass / bsc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we search for candidate inss using statistical analysis of optical ( usno - a2 ) , infrared ( iras ) , and radio ( nvss ) sources near the _ rosat _  x - ray localization , and show that this selection would find 20% of the inss in the rass / bsc . </S>",
    "<S> this selection finds 32 candidates at declinations @xmath2 , among which are two previously known inss , seventeen sources which we show are not inss , and thirteen the classification of which are as yet undetermined . </S>",
