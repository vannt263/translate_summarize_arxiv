    "numerical simulations of the growth of large scale structure ( lss ) in the universe predict that galaxies at the present day ought to lie on sheets or filaments of thickness a few mpc , separated by distances of tens to hundreds of mpc , and that these structures have been forming from early times right up to the present day ( eg , buryak et al 1994 ; bond et al 1996 ; colberg et al 1999 ) . as in the numerical models",
    "( although perhaps less clearly ) , galaxies in the local universe are indeed observed to populate such structures ( eg , jeveer et al 1978 ; geller & huchra 1989 ; da  costa et al 1994 ; shectman et al 1996 ; vettolani et al 1997 ) .",
    "however , the evolution of these structures with cosmic time has not been established empirically in more than a limited way .    in principle , almost any observable aspect of lss evolution is a strong function of cosmological parameters , including the density and age of the universe , the nature of the dark matter , and the spectrum of initial perturbations . in accordance with the general principle that all cosmological tests are much more difficult than they at first appear ,",
    "the observational situation has turned out to be disappointing , since almost any apparent evolutionary behavior , especially on small scales , is explained not just as an evolution of the lss itself but is combined with an evolving relationship between mass and light ( eg , baugh et al 1999 ; pearce et al 1999 ) , which is to a large extent unconstrained , both theoretically and observationally .",
    "even measurements of clustering with a time baseline out to redshifts @xmath8 , which have a huge cosmological `` lever arm '' are thought to place stronger constraints on the bias than the growth of structure ( steidel et al 1998 ; giavalisco et al 1998 ; adelberger et al 1998 ) !    since theoretical predictions are turning out to be soft , the caltech faint galaxy redshift survey ( cfgrs ) has the goal of contributing to an empirically based history of galaxies in the universe , which will constrain detailed theories . in what follows ,",
    "we use a pair of redshift samples , containing over 1000 galaxies to redshift unity , and spanning a range of angular separations from arcseconds to degrees , to constrain the sizes , abundances , morphologies , masses , and evolution of galaxy structures as a function of cosmic time from when the universe was roughly half its present age to the current epoch .    after the catalogs of galaxy spectra and photometry are described in section  [ sec : catalogs ] , a traditional galaxy  galaxy correlation function is measured in section  [ sec : transverse ] .",
    "the pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies is investigated in section  [ sec : pairwise ] .",
    "highly significant groups of galaxies are identified in one of our survey regions in section  [ sec : groups ] .",
    "the sizes and morphologies of these structures are investigated in section  [ sec : groupgal ] .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .    unless mentioned otherwise , the adopted world model is @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "all magnitudes are vega - relative .",
    "this study makes use of large faint galaxy redshift samples from the cfgrs , in two regions of the sky , one centered on 005323  123358 ( j2000 ) , known as the `` j0053 + 1234 region '' the other centered on 123649  621258 ( j2000 ) , known as the `` hdf region '' .",
    "the hdf region is centered on the hubble deep field image taken with the hubble space telescope ( williams et al 1996 ) .      in a previous paper ( cohen et al 1999a )",
    "redshifts were presented from a survey in a @xmath13 field , j0053 + 1234 .",
    "redshifts were obtained for 139 galaxies and identifications were made of 24 galactic stars in a flux - limited sample of 195 sources to @xmath14 flux limit @xmath15 .",
    "the sample is 84  percent complete at @xmath16  mag .",
    "the redshifts go to @xmath17 , with the median extragalactic redshift @xmath18 .",
    "this sample is , by itself , inadequate for study of galaxy clustering .",
    "the size of the field is determined primarily by the properties of the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; oke et al 1995 ) at the keck observatory , used for all of our spectroscopic observations ; the field corresponds to only @xmath19 ( proper ) in our cosmology at typical redshifts of roughly one half .",
    "to study spatial baselines of 10 to 30  mpc , it is necessary to span angular extents of 1  deg . given limits on available observing time , it is impossible at present to obtain a complete redshift sample to this depth over a contiguous solid angle of this diameter . in the 0053 + 1234 region , as will be described in more detail elsewhere ( cohen et al in preparation ) , six additional patches of sky ( `` subfields '' ) were observed , distributed over a @xmath20 area on the sky , surrounding the main j0053 + 1234 subfield .",
    "the configuration of the subfields is shown in figure  [ fig : layout ] .",
    "the displayed area of each subfield corresponds to the area covered by spectroscopically observed sources .",
    "table  [ tab : fields ] gives various properties of the subfields , including the offsets of their centers from the center of the main subfield .    for efficiency",
    ", the selection of sources ( performed with lris images taken in the @xmath21 band ) was not designed to produce complete samples in all of the subfields .",
    "the @xmath21-band photometry consists of 3-arcsec diameter focal - plane aperture magnitudes .",
    "bright sources with @xmath22  mag were eliminated to reduce the fraction of low redshift sources and thereby reduce telescope time involved in obtaining a significant sample with @xmath23 .",
    "faint sources with @xmath24  mag were also removed , as the probability of successful spectroscopic identification in only 2 hours of integration is not high .",
    "in addition , obviously stellar sources with @xmath25  mag were avoided , although a few were observed nonetheless given the vagaries of slitmak design and the need for bright setup sources with which to align the masks .",
    "furthermore , even within the restricted magnitude range @xmath26  mag , not all sources were observed .",
    "however , a large enough number of slitmasks were used in each field to wash out any spatial structure in the selection function .",
    "figure  [ fig : maghist ] shows the histogram of @xmath21-band magnitudes for all galaxies in each subfield . although the selection function is complicated , it is entirely based on 3-arcsec diameter @xmath21-band magnitudes ; in principle all important information about the selection function is therefore contained in figure  [ fig : maghist ] .",
    "the spectroscopic observations have a resolution corresponding to @xmath27 .",
    "the redshifts and galaxy spectral classes in the new subfields were determined as in the main subfield ( described in cohen et al 1999a ) .",
    "the numbers of galaxies with measured redshifts and other field information are given in table  [ tab : fields ] .",
    "the redshift completeness within the sample of sources observed exceeds 90  percent in all the subfields .",
    "the total sample of galaxies in the 0053 + 1234 region with known redshifts is 729 , with median redshift @xmath28 .",
    "figure  [ fig : zhist ] shows redshift histograms for the subfields . the j0053 +",
    "1234 sample is comparable in size to the entire cfrs survey ( crampton et al 1995 ) .",
    "the cfgrs also has obtained and compiled 610 galaxy redshifts in a sky region centered on the hdf . the sources in this region",
    "are selected in the @xmath21 band .",
    "the sample is 92  percent complete to @xmath29  mag in the deep hst - imaged portion of the hdf region and 92  percent complete to @xmath30  mag in a circular field of @xmath31  arcmin diameter centered on the deep portion .",
    "the imaging data , source selection procedures , and redshift catalog are described elsewhere ( hogg et al 2000 ; cohen et al 2000 ) . figures  [ fig : maghist ] and [ fig : zhist ] show the histograms of @xmath21-band magnitudes and redshifts for all galaxies in the hdf region .",
    "the studies of galaxy clustering presented below require comparison with a random or monte - carlo sample with little or no clustering but identical selection criteria , in terms of sky position , magnitude and redshift .",
    "a representative redshift distribution was constructed for the galaxies in each one - magnitude - wide bin in @xmath21 magnitude by smoothing the observed redshift distribution of galaxies in the redshift bin with a gaussian of @xmath32 in rest - frame velocity .",
    "random catalogs were created for each region by assigning to each real galaxy position 100 new redshifts chosen from the smoothed redshift distribution constructed for galaxies in that real galaxy s magnitude bin .",
    "this procedure results in samples with good approximations to the angular and radial selection functions of the true samples , including the complication that the source selection criteria are different in the different fields .",
    "note that the random catalog is 100 times the size of the real catalog .    because there is a small but significant angular clustering of faint galaxies",
    ", the random sample does not have strictly vanishing spatial correlations .",
    "however , the angular correlation length of faint galaxies to @xmath33 is @xmath34  arcsec ( brainerd et al 1995 ) .",
    "typical galaxy  galaxy separations in the sample are on the order of a few mpc , corresponding to hundreds of arcsec at the typical redshifts , so the bias introduced by this non - vanishing angular correlation is very small .",
    "the standard statistic for galaxy clustering is the galaxy  galaxy correlation function .",
    "the three - space correlation function @xmath35 is not directly computed here , because there are significant redshift - space distortions .",
    "rather , a projected correlation function @xmath36 is found through the angular correlation of galaxies close in redshift . for each galaxy in the real catalog ( signified by `` d '' for `` data '' ) , the number of other galaxies in the d catalog , within @xmath37 in rest - frame radial velocity ,",
    "is found in a set of perpendicular proper distance @xmath38 bins to make the number of data - data ( dd ) pairs .",
    "for each galaxy in the d catalog , the number of galaxies in the random ( `` r '' ) catalog within @xmath39 is found in the same set of @xmath38 bins ( and divided by 100 ) to make the dr pairs . for each galaxy in the r catalog , the number of galaxies in the r catalog within @xmath40 is found ( and divided by @xmath41 ) to make the rr pairs .",
    "the correlation function estimator is @xmath42 ( landy & szalay 1993 ) .    only galaxies in the redshift range @xmath43 , where the cfgrs is expected to be substantially complete ( hogg et al 1998 ) , were used in the correlation function estimation .",
    "this correlation function estimate is to be compared with a projection of the three - space correlation function @xmath35 of the form @xmath44 where @xmath39 is the @xmath45 velocity width used in the estimation , and @xmath46 is the hubble constant as a function of redshift @xmath47      the results of the correlation function estimation in the 0053 + 1234 region are shown in figures  [ fig : wthetaz ] and [ fig : wthetat ] .",
    "results of the estimation in the hdf region are shown in figure  [ fig : wtzhdf ] .",
    "error bars on the points are @xmath48 , computed by bootstrap resampling the d catalog .",
    "it is important to note that these bootstrap - resampling error bars do not include uncertainties due to the specific r sample used ( though this makes only a tiny contribution to the overall error budget ) nor uncertainties due to sample variance , which , with a sample this small , could be quite large",
    ". only intercomparison of similarly surveyed fields will provide an empirical estimate of the uncertainties due to sample variance . on the other hand",
    ", the bootstrap errors may be expected to overestimate the poisson variance in measures of the correlation function like those shown in figures  [ fig : wthetaz ] and [ fig : wthetat ] ( mo et al 1992 ) .",
    "the error bars ( and their covariances ) are discussed at more length below .",
    "figures  [ fig : wthetaz ] and [ fig : wtzhdf ] show the projected correlation function @xmath36 for the two samples split into three redshift intervals .",
    "these figures show that there is no evidence for strong evolution in the proper correlation length with redshift , although the proper correlation length is smaller in the highest redshift subsample of the 0053 + 1234 sample , and smaller in the lowest redshift subsample of the hdf sample .",
    "the figures also show a theoretical correlation function which is the appropriate line - of - sight projection of @xmath49 where the correlation length @xmath50 is set to @xmath51  proper mpc with @xmath10 and the exponent @xmath52 is set to @xmath53 .",
    "the hdf sample shows smaller correlation lengths ( weaker clustering ) than the 0053 + 1234 sample .",
    "this could be due in part to the fact that the hdf region was selected to be `` empty '' ; i.e. , devoid of large , bright galaxies , quasars , or radio sources ( williams et al 1996 ) .",
    "since this clustering analysis probes the non - linear regime , such selection criteria can strongly bias the results .",
    "this explanation is supported by the much lower clustering amplitude in the lowest redshift bin ( figures  [ fig : wtzhdf ] and [ fig : others ] ) , which is the bin most affected by avoidance of bright galaxies .",
    "it has been shown in models of structure formation that underdense regions of the universe show a lower overall clustering amplitude , although the shape ( ie , exponent ) of the correlation function may be more universal ( eg , scoccimarro et al 1999 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : wthetat ] indicates that when the galaxies are separated by spectral type ( cohen et al 1999a ) , the absorption - line - dominated galaxies show stronger correlations at small separations , as is seen in the local universe ( eg , davis & geller 1976 ; hermit et al 1996 ; willmer et al 1998 ) .",
    "of course the sample of absorption galaxies is small ( only 121 ) , so sample variance may make this result somewhat uncertain .",
    "one indication that this may be important is that the points are not well - fit by a power - law correlation function .",
    "figure  [ fig : wthetat ] also shows that there is not a very strong dependence of the clustering on absolute galaxy luminosity . for the purposes of this test",
    ", galaxy luminosities were estimated in the rest - frame @xmath21 band , using the redshift and k - corrections from the literature ( poggianti 1997 ) .",
    "a galaxy was classified as having `` high luminosity '' if its rest - frame @xmath21-band luminosity was estimated to brighter than @xmath54 where @xmath55 is taken from the evolving models of poggianti ( 1997 ) .",
    "the fact that the luminosity trend found in the local universe ( eg , willmer et al 1998 ) was not confirmed may be a consequence of the small sample size .",
    "correlation function models of the form ( [ eq : form ] ) with @xmath56 fixed were fit to the points in figures  [ fig : wthetaz ] and [ fig : wtzhdf ] by least - squares , using the bootstrap uncertainties . the best fits and uncertainties , computed by the one - parameter condition @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the best - fit value of @xmath59 ( press et al 1992 ) , are plotted in figure  [ fig : others ] .",
    "the figure also shows that the results presented here are consistent with other studies .",
    "figure  [ fig : others ] contains a line which illustrates the prediction of `` stable clustering , '' the best no - evolution model for small - scale clustering of galaxies in which virialized groupings of different scales separate without growing in the expanding universe .",
    "if the small - scale clustering of galaxies is basically accounted for by the presence of groups whose proper number densities and radii do not evolve with time , then the clustering length will decrease with increasing radius as the mean cosmic density rises ( because the clustering radius is defined to be the radius at which the overdensity is unity ) . for a correlation function of the form ( [ eq : form ] ) , clustered density falls with radius as @xmath60 and cosmic mean rises with redshift as @xmath61 ,",
    "so the stable clustering prediction is that the proper correlation length decreases with radius as @xmath62 .",
    "more detailed theoretical models , based on extensions of the cold dark matter hypothesis to include the relationship between observable galaxy clustering and mass clustering , make predictions which are remarkably similar to those of stable clustering ( baugh et al 1999 ; pearce et al 1999 ) .",
    "these models are also shown in figure  [ fig : others ] .",
    "all the studies of galaxies at redshifts @xmath63 show smaller correlation lengths than expected based on the surveys of the local universe and the assumption of stable clustering .",
    "this evolution result should be treated with caution , because galaxies observed in the @xmath63 samples have been selected and photometered with data of different qualities and spatial resolutions , observed in different photometric bandpasses , and collected in samples with very different field areas and numbers of sources .",
    "any individual study , taken by itself , including the present study , is at least marginally consistent with stable clustering .",
    "it is very important to note that the results from the two sky regions studied in this work differ by significantly more than their shot - noise ( as estimated by bootstrap resampling ) error bars .",
    "of course the field - to - field variations give a much more secure estimate of the true uncertainties than bootstrap resampling in individual sky regions .",
    "one difficult point of comparison with other studies is in the size of the error bars ; there is no agreement about how such error bars should be measured .",
    "in particular , some ( e.g. , carlberg et al 1997 ) divide bootstrap error bars by @xmath64 based on an analysis of the statistical properties of bootstrap resampling ( mo et al 1992 ) .",
    "this correction is not made here .",
    "some base error bars on internal field - to - field variations .",
    "one such study , the cfrs ( le  fvre et al 1996 ) , shows error bars significantly smaller than the field - to - field variations observed in the present work , despite having smaller numbers and similar field sizes . the field - to - field variations observed here agree with those found in the cnoc survey ( carlberg et al 2000a ) .",
    "very few surveys , if any , consider the covariances between the error bars on separate points of the angular correlation function , even though it is clear from the analysis techniques that such covariances must be strong . fortunately , with the bootstrap technique , it is possible to measure these covariances . the covariance matrix ( in the form of correlation coefficients @xmath65 defined by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the covariance between data points @xmath68 and @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the square root of the variance of data point @xmath68 ) for the first ten `` whole sample '' points in figure  [ fig : wthetat ] is @xmath71\\ ] ]",
    "it is clear that many of the covariances are large and ought to be taken into account in estimating error regions .",
    "furthermore , this matrix only represents covariances from shot noise , and not the even more significant covariances expected from the fact that the correlation function grows by gravitational clustering ( eg , scoccimarro et al 1999 ) .",
    "when @xmath59 is computed using the entire covariance matrix rather than just the individual data - point variances , the preferred ranges on the correlation length @xmath50 actually go down ( i.e. , improve ) by tens of percent .",
    "this statement is true for this study , but will not be true in general , because the values and signs of the covariances depend on the survey size and geometry , along with the analysis technique . in many cases ,",
    "inclusion of the covariances will loosen constraints on @xmath50 .",
    "the fact that the covariances affect the confidence intervals , however , demonstrates that such covariances should be taken into account in future studies .",
    "the pairwise velocity dispersion ( roughly the average radial velocity difference between pairs of nearby galaxies ) is a combined measure of the mean mass density of the universe and the amplitude of the power spectrum on relatively small scales ( eg , davis et al 1985 ) .",
    "local measurements vary somewhat by survey and technique but are generally in the range @xmath72 to @xmath7 ( davis & peebles , 1983 ; marzke et al 1995 ; somerville et al 1997b ; landy et al 1998 ) .    in the previous section ,",
    "the correlation function of galaxies was estimated from line - of - sight projections which are insensitive to line - of - sight velocities .",
    "however , just as the transverse correlation function can be measured , so can a line - of - sight velocity correlation function , which is a convolution of the real - space two - point correlation function and the pairwise velocity distribution of galaxies .",
    "the procedure is to compute a two - dimensional correlation function , as a function of both transverse separation and line - of - sight velocity difference , and then fit to models of the correlation function consisting of a radial power - law convolved with a line - of - sight velocity dispersion .",
    "the estimator is the same as that used to measure the transverse one - dimensional correlation function , but applied to two - dimensional maps of the numbers of pairs in the d and r catalogs .",
    "the fits to the two - dimensional correlation function provide similar correlation lengths to those derived from the fits to the one - dimensional function , although with larger uncertainties .",
    "the best - fit velocity dispersions are found to vary strongly from field to field and from redshift interval to redshift interval , over the range @xmath73 .",
    "the reason for this variation is that although the prominent redshift features or groups found in the pencil - beam samples contain only about half of the galaxies , they contain the vast majority of the velocity - space galaxy pairs .",
    "this means that any measurement of pairwise velocity dispersion will be dominated by the particular galaxy groups found in that region , in that redshift range .",
    "the pairwise velocity dispersion is a statistic strongly dominated by the highest density regions of a survey .",
    "this is not a new result ; indeed , local measurements of this velocity dispersion in surveys of @xmath74 to @xmath41 galaxies are strongly affected by the inclusion or exclusion of the richest groups or clusters ( eg , marzke et al 1995 , somerville et al 1997b ) .",
    "this is also true of the simulations ( somerville et al 1997a ) .",
    "surveys including several or many @xmath41 galaxies may be large enough to give stable results ( landy et al 1998 ) .",
    "the redshift histograms for the fields are shown in figure  [ fig : zhist ] , along with the radial velocity selection functions implied by the random catalogs .",
    "as has been noted previously ( eg , broadhurst et al 1990 ; crampton et al 1995 ; cohen et al 1996a ; cohen et al 1996b ; koo et al 1996 ) , these `` pencil - beam '' redshift samples exhibit extremely strong clustering along the line of sight in redshift space . in the main subfield in the j0053 + 1234 region , with its complete sample , we estimated ( cohen etal 1996a ) that more than half of the galaxies lie in the five strongest redshift features , which , except for one with a very high velocity dispersion , probably correspond to poor groups of galaxies .",
    "the spatial distributions of the galaxies in these redshift features support this ( cohen et al 1996a ) ; they are non - uniform with little central concentration ( except in the strongest feature at @xmath18 ) .",
    "similar conclusions were reached in the hdf region ( cohen et al 1996b ) .",
    "these redshift features are well - sampled to @xmath75 and appear to persist to higher redshifts .",
    "at all redshifts , galaxies are often found in pairs , presumably merging ( eg , carlberg et al 2000b ) .",
    "it is apparent from figure  [ fig : zhist ] that all the subfields show these redshift features .",
    "five of the redshift features may correspond to abell richness class @xmath76 or greater galaxy clusters , ie , clusters containing more than 20 galaxy members with absolute magnitudes brighter than two mag fainter than the absolute magnitude of the third brightest member .",
    "these include the @xmath18 feature in the j0053 + 1234 main subfield , the @xmath77 feature in the j0053 + 1234 19 west subfield , and three features at @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 in the hdf region .",
    "these structures have velocity dispersions above @xmath81 and tens of galaxies within the brightest few magnitudes .",
    "the presence of these five rich structures in our combined samples seems reasonable ; an extrapolation to @xmath82 of the areal density of the sparsest clusters in the palomar distant cluster survey ( postman et al 1996 ) predicts that we should find some of these true clusters .",
    "the statistics of these redshift - space features are discussed elsewhere ( cohen et al 1996a , 1996b , 2000 ) .",
    "briefly , they tend to have velocity dispersions of @xmath83 , with large uncertainties since they approach the redshift measurement uncertainties of @xmath84 ( in line - of - sight rest - frame velocity ) .",
    "the galaxies in the features are spread across the pencil - beam subfields , each of which spans a few proper mpc at the redshifts of interest .",
    "typical comoving line - of - sight distances between adjacent features in a single subfield is @xmath85 .",
    "the distribution of comoving radial separations between the redshift - space features shows little evidence of a feature near @xmath86  mpc and no evidence for periodic structures seen in previous studies ( broadhurst et al 1990 ) .",
    "the transverse size of the individual subfields is @xmath87 proper mpc over most of the redshift interval of interest .",
    "we introduce a proper longitudinal coordinate @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the age of the universe and just deal with structures whose longitudinal extent in @xmath90 exceeds @xmath91 proper mpc ( @xmath92  km s@xmath93 over redshifts of interest ) .",
    "we are also interested in features whose longitudinal extent is less than the transverse separation between subfields which is roughly @xmath94 proper mpc .",
    "our procedure ( _ cf _ cohen _ et al _ 1998 ) is to examine the overdensities after rebinning the data with all widths @xmath95 in the range 3 - 10  proper mpc and all phases and to minimize the probability of a feature arising by chance relative to a poissonian distribution .",
    "this gives us a procedure , albeit somewhat arbitrary , for identifying and rank ordering features on the basis of their relative significance .",
    "this also allows us to include features and sub - features together .",
    "the rank - ordered ( by statistical significance ) features , obtained by this procedure , with the number @xmath96 of galaxy members and velocity dispersions @xmath97 , are given in table  [ tab : features ] .",
    "we have chosen only the eight most significant features for the investigations of size and morphology which follow .",
    "as the seven pencils in the j0053 + 1234 region span nearly a degree on the sky , we can investigate the degree of clustering on larger linear scales , @xmath98 proper mpc , than probed by the two - point correlation function .",
    "previously ( cohen et al 1998 ) we have hypothesized that structures on even larger scales ( @xmath99  mpc ) are present in the distribution of galaxies when the universe was less than half its present age that resemble the giant voids and walls reported in the local universe ( eg , jeveer et al 1978 ; geller & huchra 1989 ; da  costa et al 1994 ; shectman et al 1996 ; vettolani et al 1997 ) .",
    "we now have enough data to examine this hypothesis .",
    "much of the controversy that surrounds the description of clustering on these scales stems from inadequate , quantitative descriptions of large scale structure . when presented with data in which at most a few large features are present , statistical measures like the two point correlation function that assume random phases , or at least a huge , fair sample of the universe , are likely to be misleading .",
    "furthermore , genuinely random density fields typically exhibit structures which appear , subjectively , to be non - random .",
    "faced with these difficulties , we shall limit ourselves to a description of the structure that we have observed and a comparison with the structure that we find in control locations .",
    "( we have attempted to perform more quantitative analyses based upon the karhunen - loeve transformation and the `` counts in cells '' method but find that these do not give stable answers with these samples . )",
    "three of the most significant redshift features are in the vicinity of @xmath100 .",
    "these three features lie along the north - south axis passing through the main subfield and they span the full degree of the j0053 + 1234 region .",
    "this suggests large galaxy structures that span several subfields . in order to test the hypothesis that such large structure is generic , each of the eight identified features ( in table  [ tab : features ] )",
    "was taken in turn and the cross - correlation with individual galaxies out to large proper radii was computed .",
    "specifically , all galaxies located within proper distances @xmath101 mpc of the group center were binned .",
    "these numbers were ratioed with the same for the random catalog and unity was subtracted to make a standard cross - correlation function .",
    "for comparison with a control sample , the exercise was repeated with the same group centers displaced in redshift by 0.1 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : groupgal ] , with error bars on the control points found by taking the scatter among the results for each of the eight control redshift features .",
    "no individual group shows a regular , power - law cross - correlation , so it is not possible to objectively fit the individual functions .",
    "roughly speaking , cross - correlation lengths of 5 to 20  proper mpc are found , with large group - to - group scatter .",
    "these sizes , combined with the measured velocity dispersions of a few @xmath102 imply virial masses from a few @xmath103 to a few @xmath104 .",
    "crossing times are several @xmath105 years .",
    "the groups near @xmath100 show the largest correlation lengths because there are three of them , spanning @xmath106  deg on the sky .",
    "galaxy structures of this size have been found previously ( small et al 1999 ) .    there is a second hypothesis that can be tested with this data set .",
    "this is that galaxies are concentrated on planes , similar to those that have been reported locally and are sometimes found in numerical simulations . in order to define a plane",
    ", we must consider three non - colinear points .",
    "for each feature ( group center ) , any two additional galaxies outside the feature define , along with the feature center a plane .",
    "the unit normal vector ( 3-vector ) to this plane can be constructed .",
    "the direction cosines of this normal vector are defined to be the two components of the vector transverse to the line of sight ; the projection of the normal vector onto the plane of the sky .",
    "( those galaxies which lie in the same subfield as the feature and those pairs for which the subfields are colinear with the feature , for which the planes are poorly defined , are excluded . )",
    "the direction cosines for each triplet ( two galaxies and the feature center ) are plotted on a plane , for each feature and a set of controls , in figure  [ fig : dircos ] .",
    "if the features lie in prominent planes of galaxies , these will show up as clustering of points on the direction cosine plane .",
    "as usual , the controls were made by translating the features in redshift by 0.1 .",
    "there is no clear evidence that galaxies are concentrated on planes from these data .",
    "it is notable , however , that three of the highly significant redshift features ( near @xmath107 ) ar roughly colinear .",
    "figure  [ fig : spine ] shows the galaxy configuration in the region of these galaxy structures .",
    "they may represent part of a filament , a structure generic to the numerical simulations .",
    "clearly studies such as these of the morphologies of large - scale structures will benefit from large , densely sampled , contiguous areas of sky .",
    "the sparse coverage of the j0053 + 1234 field , though necessary for probing large angular scales , is not sufficient for making definitive statements about structure morphology .",
    "a clustering analysis is performed on two samples of @xmath0 faint galaxies each , in two widely separated regions of the sky .",
    "one of the survey regions is configured so that there are galaxy pairs spanning angular separations of up to @xmath1  deg .",
    "the median redshifts of the galaxy samples are both @xmath2 .",
    "no strong evolution of the proper galaxy ",
    "galaxy correlation length with redshift is found ( relative to stable clustering ) , although samples of @xmath108 sources are simply not large enough for detecting subtle changes .",
    "there is some evidence for weaker - than - stable clustering at intermediate redshift , when the results presented here are compared with surveys of the local ( @xmath109 ) universe , but it is to be cautioned that this result depends on comparing samples selected and observed with very different techniques .",
    "strong field - to - field variations are found , possibly emphasized by the stringent `` blank - field '' criteria used to select the hdf .",
    "galaxies with absorption - line - dominated spectra show much stronger clustering at proper distances of @xmath5  mpc than typical field galaxies , in qualitative similarity to the morphological segregation observed in the local universe .",
    "although pairwise velocity dispersions are measured to be in the range @xmath6 to @xmath7 , measured value for any particular sky region and redshift interval is dominated by the prevalent individual redshift features . for this reason ,",
    "no statement about the evolution in pairwise velocity dispersion is possible from these data .",
    "each individual pencil - beam redshift sample contains of order five significant features ( `` peaks '' ) in its redshift distribution to redshift unity . associating the redshift features with physical galaxy structures ,",
    "we have performed a three - dimensional structure  galaxy correlation analysis and find that galaxies show measurable clustering around these structures out to @xmath3  mpc .",
    "these lengthscales are longer than the galaxy  galaxy correlation length and similar to scales of superclusters found locally and , indeed , at even higher redshifts ( lubin et al 2000 ) .",
    "there is some evidence for filaments , although pencil - beam surveys are not ideally suited for finding them in general .",
    "the most prominent galaxy structures have velocity dispersions of a few @xmath102 and coherence lengths of 5 to 15 proper mpc in the adopted cosmology .",
    "these physical parameters imply masses of @xmath110 to @xmath111 .",
    "the galaxies in the structures are not obviously concentrated in walls or sheets , and no evidence is found for periodicity on very large length scales . on the other hand ,",
    "this survey of spatially separated , sparsely sampled pencil beams is not extremely sensitive to all kinds of structure morphology and will be outmoded by future surveys with larger contiguous solid angle coverage .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank ray carlberg , daniel eisenstein , simon lilly , jim peebles , roman scoccimarro , todd small and an anonymous referee for useful comments , discussions and assistance with the literature .",
    "this research is based on observations made at the w. m. keck observatory , which is operated jointly by the california institute of technology and the university of california ; and at the palomar observatory , which is owned and operated by the california institute of technology .",
