    "extragalactic radio sources are well suited to probe the large scale structure of the universe since they are detected over large cosmological distances ( up to @xmath10 ) , are unaffected by dust extinction , and can thus provide an unbiased sampling of volumes larger than those usually probed by optical surveys . on the other hand , their 3d - space distribution can be recovered only in the very local universe ( @xmath11 ; see peacock @xmath12 nicholson 1991 ; magliocchetti et al .",
    "2004 ) because the majority of radio galaxies detected in the available large area surveys , carried out at low frequencies , have very faint optical counterparts , so that measurements of their redshifts are a difficult task . as a result",
    ", only the angular clustering can be measured for the radio source population .",
    "interestingly , high - frequency surveys have much higher identification rates ( ricci et al .",
    "2004 ) , suggesting that this difficulty may be overcome when such surveys will cover sufficiently large areas .",
    "even the detection of clustering in the 2d distribution of radio sources proved to be extremely difficult ( see webster 1976 , seldner @xmath12 peebles 1981 , shaver @xmath12 pierre 1989 ) since , when projected onto the sky , the space correlation is significantly diluted because of the broad redshift distribution of radio sources .",
    "it was only with the advent of deep radio surveys covering large areas of the sky , such as the first ( becker , white @xmath12 helfand 1995 ) , wenss ( rengelink et al .",
    "1997 ) , nvss ( condon et al . 1998 ) , and sumss ( bock , large @xmath12 sadler 1999 ) , that the angular clustering of this class of objects has been detected with a high statistical significance down to flux density limits of few mjy ( see cress et al .",

    "amongst all the above surveys , nvss is characterized by the most extensive sky coverage and can thus take advantage of high statistics despite its relatively high flux limit ( @xmath13mjy vs @xmath14mjy of first ) .",
    "the two - point angular correlation function , @xmath0 , measured for nvss sources brighter than 10 mjy is well described by a power - law , extending from @xmath15 degrees up to scales of almost 10 degrees . a signal of comparable amplitude and shape was detected in the first survey at the same flux density limit , on scales of up to 2 - 3 degrees ( see e.g. magliocchetti et al . 1999 ) , while at larger angular separations any positive clustering signal - if present - was hidden by the noise .    most analyses of radio source clustering performed so far ( see e.g. blake @xmath12 wall 2002a , b ; overzier et al .",
    "2003 ) assume a two - point spatial correlation function of the form @xmath16 .",

    "the studies summarized by overzier et al .",
    "( 2003 ) typically found correlation lengths @xmath17 in the range 515@xmath18mpc .",
    "this large range may reflect on one hand real differences in the correlation properties of radio sources of different classes / luminosities , and , on the other hand , the large uncertainties on both the redshift distribution of the sources and the time - evolution of clustering , which are necessary ingredients to estimate @xmath19 from the observed @xmath0 .",
    "overzier et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found that the observed clustering of powerful radio sources is consistent either with an essentially redshift independent _ comoving _ correlation length @xmath20mpc , close to that measured for extremely red objects ( eros ) at @xmath21 ( daddi et al .",

    "the present - day value of @xmath22 for the most powerful radio sources is comparable to that of local rich clusters .    a deeper examination of the power - law behaviour of the angular two - point correlation function up to scales of the order of @xmath23 highlights some interesting issues . in fact , within the cold dark matter paradigm of structure formation",

    "( see e.g. matsubara 2004 , fig .  1 )",
    ", which , at the average redshift for radio sources @xmath29 , corresponds to angular separations of only a few ( @xmath30 ) degrees , in clear contrast with the observations .",
    "this opens the question of how to reconcile the clustering properties of these sources with the standard scenario of structure formation .",
    "magliocchetti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) claim that the large - scale positive tail of the angular correlation function @xmath0 can be reproduced by allowing for a suitable choice of the time - evolution of the bias parameter , characterizing the way radio galaxies trace the underlying mass distribution .",
    "although promising , this approach suffers from a number of limitations due to both theoretical modelling and the quality of data then available .",
    "the aim of the present work is therefore to investigate in better detail and to provide a self - consistent explanation of the puzzling behaviour of the angular correlation function of radio sources , especially on large angular scales .",
    "we will concentrate on the results from the nvss survey ( blake & wall 2002b ; overzier et al . 2003 ) as , thanks to the extremely good statistics , a clear detection of a positive clustering signal was obtained up to @xmath1 .",
    "we will exploit the available spectroscopic information on local radio sources to limit the uncertainties on their redshift distribution , and will mainly focus on the time evolution of their clustering properties via the bias parameter . in this way we will derive interesting constraints on the typical mass of dark matter halos hosting the population of radio sources .",
    "we will also investigate the dependence of the predicted angular correlation function on cosmological parameters .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "a short description of the nvss survey is presented in section  [ sec : nvss ] .",
    "section  [ sec : nz ] illustrates the adopted model for the redshift distribution of mjy radio sources , while in section  [ sec : model ] we provide the formalism for the two - point angular correlation function .",
    "results and discussions are presented in section  [ sec : results ] . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "the nvss ( nrao vla sky survey , condon et al . 1998 ) is the largest radio survey that currently exists at @xmath31ghz .",
    "it was constructed between 1993 and 1998 and covers @xmath32sr of the sky north of @xmath33 .",
    "the survey was performed with the vla in the d configuration and the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the synthesized beam is 45 arcsec .",
    "the source catalogue contains 1.8@xmath3410@xmath35 sources and it is claimed to be 99 per cent complete above the integrated flux density s@xmath36mjy .    the two - point angular correlation function , @xmath0 , of nvss sources has been measured by blake @xmath12 wall ( 2002a , 2002b ) and overzier et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for different flux - density thresholds between 3 mjy and 500 mjy .",
    "the overall shape of @xmath0 is well reproduced by a double power - law . on scales below @xmath37 ,",
    "the steeper power - law reflects the distribution of the resolved components of single giant radio sources . on larger scales the shallower power - law describes the correlation between distinct radio sources . since the behaviour on small scales",
    "is mainly determined by the joint effect of the astrophysical properties of the sources and of the resolution of vla in the various configurations , while that on larger scales is of cosmological origin , we will concentrate on the latter only .",
    "in fact , the clustering behaviour on scales @xmath38 provides insights on both the nature of the radio sources , through the way in which they trace the underlying dark matter distribution , and on the cosmological framework which determines the distribution of dark matter at each epoch .",
    "we will consider the two - point angular correlation function as measured by blake @xmath12 wall ( 2002b ) for sources with @xmath39 mjy .",
    "such a flux limit ensures the survey to be complete and , at the same time , provides good enough statistics to measure angular clustering up to very large scales with small uncertainties .",
    "moreover , this limit also represents the deepest flux - density for which systematic surface density gradients are approximately negligible ( blake & wall 2002a ) .",
    "the nvss source surface density at this threshold is 16.9 deg@xmath40 .",
    "the data corresponding to separations in the range @xmath41 most likely suffer from a deficit of pairs probably due to an imperfect cleaning of bright side lobes ( see blake , mauch @xmath12 sadler , 2004 ) .",
    "therefore in the following we will only consider scales @xmath42 . in this range of scales ,",
    "the measured angular correlation function is found to be described as a power law , @xmath43 , with @xmath44 in degrees ( see blake , mauch @xmath12 sadler 2004 ) .",
    "in order to provide theoretical predictions for the angular two - point correlation function of a given class of objects it is necessary to know their redshift distribution , @xmath45 , i.e. the number of objects per unit comoving volume as a function of redshift . unfortunately , the redshift distribution of mjy radio sources is not yet accurately known as the majority of radio sources powered by active galactic nuclei ( agn )  which dominate the mjy population  are located at cosmological distances ( @xmath46 ) and are in general hosted by galaxies which are optically extremely faint .",
    "a large set of models for the epoch - dependent radio luminosity function ( hereafter rlf ) are available in literature ( see e.g. dunlop @xmath12 peacock 1990 , rowan - robinson et al . 1993 , toffolatti et al .",
    "1998 , jackson @xmath12 wall 1999 , willot et al . 2001 ) , but they all suffer from the fact that they are mainly based on , and constrained by data sets which include only bright sources ( @xmath47mjy ) so that any extrapolation of their predictions to lower fluxes is quite uncertain .",
    "amongst all the available rlfs , those provided by dunlop @xmath12 peacock ( 1990 , hereafter dp90 ) are the most commonly used to infer the redshift distribution of radio sources at the mjy level .",
    "dp90 derived their set of rlfs on the basis of spectroscopically complete samples from several radio surveys at different frequencies . by using a ` maximum entropy ' analysis they determined polynomial approximations to the luminosity function and its evolution with redshift which were all consistent with the data available at that time .",
    "in addition , they also proposed two models of a more physical nature , assuming either pure luminosity evolution ( hereafter ple ) or luminosity / density evolution .",
    "recently , with the aim of determining the photometric and spectroscopic properties for at least the population of local ( i.e. @xmath48 ) radio sources at the mjy level , a number of studies have concentrated on samples obtained combining radio catalogues like first and nvss with optical ones like sdss and 2dfgrs ( sadler et al .",
    "2002 , ivezi@xmath49 et al .",
    "2002 , magliocchetti et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ) .",
    "the radio / optical samples obtained in this way provide a crucial constraint at @xmath50 for any theoretical model aiming at describing the epoch - dependent rlf .",
    "for instance , magliocchetti et al .",
    "( 2002 , hereafter m02 ) have shown that the rlf at 1.4 ghz derived from all the objects in their spectroscopic sample having @xmath51 mjy and @xmath52 , is well reproduced at relatively high radio luminosities ( @xmath53 ) by the dp90 s ple model for steep - spectrum fri - frii sources ( fanaroff @xmath12 riley 1974 ) . at lower radio luminosities , where the radio population is dominated by star - forming galaxies ,",
    "the measured rlf is better described by the one proposed by saunders et al .",
    "( 1990 ) for iras galaxies ( see also rowan - robinson et al .",
    "1993 ) , although with a small adjustment of the parameters .",
    "following to m02 , we adopt the dp90 ple model to derive the redshift distribution of agn - fuelled radio sources with @xmath54mjy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dndz_1.4ghz_10mjy ] , dashed line ) . we will not take into account the other dp90 models , since we have found them to be inconsistent with the local rlf .",
    "in fact , while the model assuming density / luminosity evolution over - predicts the number of steep - spectrum radio galaxies below @xmath55 , models using polynomial approximations for the rlf give an unrealistic overestimate of the number of local sources at every luminosity .    we will also use the fit provided by m02 to the local rlf in order to estimate the redshift distribution of star - forming radio galaxies with @xmath56mjy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dndz_1.4ghz_10mjy ] , dotted line ) .",
    "note that star - forming galaxies comprise less than 30% of the @xmath11 population of radio sources with @xmath54mjy , and only @xmath57 of the total counts at this flux limit . as we will show in the next section",

    "the fit obtained for a zero offset @xmath141 is really good , but is obtained for a local matter density parameter @xmath131 substantially smaller than what indicated by other data sets ( see e.g. spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , although the difference is significant to less than @xmath142 . taken at face value ,",
    "our results indicate that , within the standard cosmological framework , in the local universe radio sources are as strongly clustered as rich clusters of galaxies , in excellent agreement with the findings of peacock & nicholson ( 1991 ) and magliocchetti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .    as a last comment",
    ", we note that the degeneracy between the host halo mass and the matter density parameter indicates that large area radio surveys without redshift information can hardly provide significant constraints on cosmological parameters , unless independent information on @xmath75 is available . on the other hand , for a given set of cosmological parameters , such surveys yield important information on the masses of the hosting halos .",
    "the observed angular two - point correlation function of mjy radio sources exhibits the puzzling feature of a power - law behaviour up to very large ( @xmath1 ) angular scales .",
    "standard models for clustering , which successfully account for the clustering properties of optically selected quasars , turn out to be unable to explain the long positive tail of the @xmath0 , even when ` extreme ' values for the parameters are invoked .",
    "this is because  according to the standard scenario for biased galaxy formation in which extragalactic sources are more strongly clustered at higher redshifts  the clustering signal of radio sources at @xmath143 , which is negative on large scales , overwhelms that of more local sources , yielding a sharp cut - off in the angular two - point correlation function on scales of @xmath1442 degrees .",
    "the only way out we could find is to invoke the clustering strength of radio sources to be weaker in the past .",
    "the data can then be accounted for if we assume that the characteristic mass of the halos in which these objects reside , @xmath145 , is proportional to @xmath120 , the typical mass - scale at which the matter density fluctuations collapse to form bound structures ( see mo @xmath12 white 1996 ) .",
    "a good fit of the observed @xmath0 up to scales of at least @xmath146 degrees is obtained for @xmath147/h .",
    "the data on larger scales can be accurately reproduced if the measured values of @xmath0 are slightly enhanced by small systematic variations in the source surface density due to calibration problems at low flux densities ( blake & wall 2002a ) . in the absence of such a systematic offset",
    ", the data might indicate a lower value of the mean cosmic matter density than indicated by other data sets .",
    "the best fit is indeed obtained for @xmath118 and @xmath148/h , with rather large uncertainties on both parameters , as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig : grid_om0m.vs.meffz ] . in particular , the best fit value of @xmath131 is less than @xmath142 away from the ` concordance ' value .",
    "this shows that current large scale radio surveys without redshift measurements can not provide strong constraints on cosmological parameters , but are informative on the evolution history of the dark matter halos hosting radio sources",
    ".    taken at face value , the above results point to different evolutionary properties for different types of agns as the decreasing trend for the effective mass ruling the clustering of radio sources found in this work strongly differs from the behaviour of that associated to optically selected quasars .",
    "for the latter sources , the data are in fact consistent with a constant @xmath149/h , at least up to the highest probed redshift , @xmath150 ( see e.g. grazian et al .",
    "2004 ; porciani et al . 2004 ; croom et al . 2005 ) this different behaviour is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bz ] , where the values of the bias inferred for optically selected quasars have been scaled to the values of @xmath134 and @xmath131 used here .",
    "it must be noted , however , that the present data provide very weak constraints on the clustering properties of radio sources at @xmath151 . for example",
    ", we have directly checked that the predicted @xmath0 does not change significantly over the range of angular scales considered here if we assume @xmath152 for @xmath153 and @xmath154/h at higher redshifts .",
    "it is thus possible that the difference in the clustering evolution between agn - powered radio sources and optically selected quasars is limited to @xmath155 , consistent with observational indications that , at higher redshifts , the environment of radio - quiet and radio - loud qsos is almost the same ( russel , ellison @xmath12 benn 2005 ) .",
    "interestingly , our analysis indicates that , at @xmath21 , the effective halo mass associated to radio sources is consistent with being essentially equal to that of optical quasars ( croom et al .",
    "this suggests that , at least in this redshift range , the bias parameter for radio - loud and radio - quiet agns is similar .",
    "on the other hand , our findings suggest that , at least for @xmath155 and at variance with what found for optical quasars , the clustering of radio sources reflects that of the largest halos which collapse at any given cosmic epoch .",
    "this conclusion is in keeping with results of previous studies showing that , locally , radio sources are preferentially associated with groups and clusters of galaxies ( e.g. peacock & nicholson 1991 ; magliocchetti et al .",
    "2004 ) , and , at higher redshift , are often associated with very massive galaxies and very massive galaxy environments ( e.g. carilli et al .",
    "1997 ; best , longair @xmath12 r@xmath156ttgering 1998 ; venemans et al .",
    "2002 ; best et al .",
    "2003 ; croft et al .",
    "2005 ; overzier et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the major intriguing point that remains unsolved is the link with the population of optical qsos .",
    "the clustering properties of these latter objects seem to reflect that of `` normal '' elliptical galaxies .",
    "so why this difference ?",
    "clearly , more observations are crucial to shed light on this issue .",
    "so far the main limitation to our understanding of the environmental properties of radio sources has been due to selection effects that allow identifications of mostly radio galaxies in the local universe and exclusively quasars ( regardless of their radio activity ) at higher redshifts .",
    "therefore , it would be of uttermost importance to consider a redshift range in which the clustering properties of both radio galaxies and radio - active quasars can be measured with good precision .",
    "we plan to tackle this issue in a forthcoming paper .",
