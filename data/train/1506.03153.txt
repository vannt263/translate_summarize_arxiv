    "the term ` runaway ' has traditionally been used to describe b type stars which are found in the galactic halo . since b",
    "type stars require gas rich , high density environments to form , their presence far from the galactic disk is puzzling .",
    "adding to the confusion is the observation that these stars may have intrinsically large peculiar velocities , which is difficult to explain if one assumes that these stars did in fact form in the galactic disk .",
    "several theories have been posited to explain how these stars may have been ejected from the populations they were born into .",
    "the first theory is the so - called _ binary ejection mechanism_. proposed by @xcite , this theory postulates that these runaway stars originated in binary systems and were ` kicked ' out of their systems by the death of their companions .",
    "if the companion goes supernova , its gravitational attraction will be greatly lessened by the shedding of mass , which can unbind the runaway and send it into the field .",
    "additional effects may come from asymmetric explosions which are known to impart large kicks ( sometimes in excess of of 1000 km s@xmath1 ) to the neutron star remnant @xcite .",
    "this mechanism usually yields a runaway with a velocity similar to that of its pre - dissociated orbital velocity .    the second theory , the _ dynamical ejection mechanism _ ,",
    "was suggested by @xcite . in the case of binary systems interacting with another very massive star",
    ", one member of the binary may be captured by the interloping star , while the other could be ejected with high velocity ( several hundred km s@xmath1 @xcite ) .",
    "similar effects could occur in interacting binaries @xcite , or dynamically unstable tertiary systems . in these interactions ,",
    "the kick imparted is usually close to the orbital speed of the binary components , but may be as large as the escape velocity from the surface of the most massive interacting object @xcite .",
    "this process is expected to dominate in crowded regions such as star clusters . in the low velocity regime , this mechanism is responsible for ` stellar evaporation ' and leads to the observed mass segregation in clusters .",
    "a third ejection process , involving interaction of a binary system with a black hole , operates in much the same way as the dynamical ejection mechanism ( in the case of a binary colliding with a massive star ) but is capable of imparting much larger kicks due to the extreme mass of the black hole .",
    "this method of ejection is known as the _ hills mechanism _ @xcite .",
    "stars ejected in such a manner were observationally confirmed first by @xcite and later shown to have non - isotropic distributions @xcite .",
    "this anisotropy is thought to be an effect of the accretion patterns of the supermassive black hole in the center - most regions of the galaxy .",
    "up until very recently , studies of these ejected objects have been limited to high mass early type stars .",
    "this is because it is much easier to find high probability candidates for follow up . looking at faint magnitudes and high latitudes , one composes a sample of short lifetime objects based on their colors ; the faintness ensures a great distance for these intrinsically bright objects , and the high latitude ensures a galactic halo location .",
    "follow up spectroscopy is then needed to confirm the spectral type and to find the velocity and distance with high precision .",
    "now however , with large spectroscopic surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) , the radial velocity experiment ( rave ; @xcite ) and the large sky area multi - object fiber spectroscopic telescope ( lamost ; @xcite ) , tremendous amounts of spectra are being collected over vast areas of the sky . when combined with long baseline astrometric measurements from the united states naval observatory ( usno ; @xcite ) catalog , proper motions may be calculated .",
    "all that is left is to estimate distances to objects using photometric distance estimations ( such as isochrone fitting ) and six dimensional phase space information for hundreds of thousands of objects can be estimated .",
    "this allows for sophisticated data - mining efforts to find chancely observed outlier stars ; such endeavors have already been undertaken by @xcite who report some of the first g and k hypervelocity star candidates .",
    "we perform a search for escape - velocity stars using different methods and rediscover some of their candidates as well as report new ones .",
    "this study constitutes one of the largest statistical studies of kinematically outlying late - type main sequence objects , enabled by exploiting modern million - item spectroscopic surveys and using kinematics to identify runaway populations .",
    "prior studies of runaway stars have , by and large , been positionally based , and not kinematically based ( candidates are selected via photometry only and then analyzed kinematically with follow up ) .",
    "it is only recently that studies have begun to investigate low mass stars which may have been ejected from their neighborhoods of birth ( see for example @xcite , @xcite and @xcite )",
    ". using a previously unexploited sample of red stars ( typically f - to - m type ) , we assign them likelihoods based on their phase space coordinates and use these likelihoods to characterize them as a function of their probability of being runaways .    owing to contradictory usage of terms in the literature",
    ", we would now like to declare the nomenclature used for the rest of this paper .",
    "when we use the term _ hypervelocity _ , we mean that the star is traveling fast enough to escape the potential of the milky way .",
    "the term _ hills star _ will be used to denote a star which may have interacted with the central supermassive black hole .",
    "we will refer to stars which have kinematics similar with their neighbors as _",
    "natural _ and stars with unlikely kinematics will be referred to as _ outliers_.    in section 2.1 we outline the data used in this study and characterize the reliability of the proper motion measurements . in section 2.2",
    "we explain the methods used to calculate object phase space information and orbital parameters .",
    "section 3.1 explains the methodology we use to fit phase - space profiles to the data ; and section 3.2 details the usage of these fits to generate a likelihood value for every star based on its six dimensional position .",
    "section 4.1 analyzes the relationship between this assigned likelihood and the characteristics of the stars : in sections 4.2 and 4.3 we present possible hypervelocity stars and possible hills stars .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "having investigated the accuracy of the proper motions , we now investigate the accuracy of the proper motion errors .",
    "this is a critical aspect as it heavily affects the outcomes of our monte carlo expansions . to do this we again compare the catalogs of @xcite and @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : pm_errs ] we plot the observed difference in stellar proper motions along with the expected differences from the reported errors of both catalogs . as a secondary test , also in figure [ fig : pm_errs ]",
    ", we plot the motions of spectroscopically identified quasars in the catalog of @xcite along with their expected motions as a result of the errors on their proper motion estimates .",
    "for the quasars , we see that the proper motions predicted by the formal proper motion uncertainties are marginally larger than the observed ones , implying that munn s errors may be slightly overestimated . in the comparison of proper motions between the two catalogs we see , in general , a reasonably good agreement between the observed and predicted distributions .",
    "the observed difference is slightly larger than the formal uncertainties would suggest , but this is not a strong effect . the small tail in this plot is likely an effect of mismatching the objects between the catalogs and , in conclusion",
    ", we believe that the errors reported in the @xcite catalog are reliable ."
