    "many algorithms have recently been developed for mining frequent patterns .",
    "traditionally , these patterns consist of subsets of attributes in a relational database @xcite . recently ,",
    "other patterns have been mined , such as trees  @xcite and graphs  @xcite .",
    "however , most objects appearing in nature lack the discrete character of graph and trees . in this paper",
    "we explore the possibility of applying the framework of frequent pattern mining to a class of continuous objects appearing in nature , namely knots .",
    "a knot can be thought of as a piece of rope ( where the rope has zero thicknes ) which forms a loop in three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : trefoil ] shows an example of a knot known as the trefoil knot .",
    "the history of knots dates back to the late 1800 s when lord kelvin suggested that atoms where knots in an invisible and frictionless fluid .",
    "since then , theoretical properties of knots are extensively studied in mathematics  @xcite . in physics , knot invariants ( e.g. , the jones polynomial )",
    "are used in statistical physics  @xcite and knots also appear in the context of quantum gravity  @xcite .",
    "recently , knots showed up as building blocks for future quantum computers  @xcite .    in biology ,",
    "knots are used to characterize topoisomerase enzymes  @xcite and in polymer science , physical properties of long ring polymers , such as dna , gels and rubbers are related to properties of knots  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that knots are present in such polymers with probability one when the polymers are long enough  @xcite .",
    "there is also much interest in developing artificial knotted biopolymers as building blocks for dna - based computing  @xcite .",
    "the study of knotted polymers is done both by using experimentally obtained knots and by using knots obtained by numerical approaches based on self - avoiding random - walk simulations .",
    "examples of questions one would like to answer in these studies are what is the probability of having a certain knot in polymers of a certain length  @xcite , and whether the knots appear tight or loose in the knotted polymers  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we consider the _ frequent knot mining problem _ which can be stated as follows : given a collection of knots , find all subknots which appear frequently in this collection .",
    "we believe that finding frequent subknots in a large collection of real or simulated knotted polymers , will contribute to a deeper understanding of the statistical properties of knotted polymers in @xmath0 .",
    "this article reports a first attempt for solving the frequent knot mining problem .",
    "the solution presented in this article consists of three steps :    1 .",
    "encoding of knots in transactions ; 2 .",
    "mining these transactions ; and finally , 3 .",
    "decoding of the frequent itemsets into knots .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section 2 , definitions are given and the frequent knot mining problem is stated formally .",
    "the encoding ( decoding ) of knots ( transactions ) into transactions ( knots ) is described in section 3 . in section 4 , we present the knotminer algorithm for mining frequent knots .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "a _ knot _ @xmath1 can be thought of as a piece of rope ( where the rope has zero thickness ) which forms a loop in three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath0 .",
    "two knots @xmath1 and @xmath2 are equivalent , or in symbols @xmath3 , if they can be transformed into each other without cutting and pasting the ropes .",
    "we will only consider so - called tame knots .",
    "these are knots which are equivalent to piecewise linear knots , i.e. , knots consisting of a finite number of straight lines .",
    "a knot is trivial if it is equivalent to a rope which forms a circle in a plane in @xmath0 .",
    "a knot can be finitely represented by a _",
    "knot diagram_. the knot diagram of a knot @xmath1 is a connected undirected planar graph , which correspond to a ( generic ) projection of @xmath1 onto a plane .",
    "vertices in a knot diagram correspond to places where the projection of the knot intersects , and each edge adjacent to a vertex is labelled as an undercrossing or overcrossing , whichever is the case .",
    "given a knot diagram consisting of @xmath4 vertices one can find in time polynomial in @xmath4 a piecewise linear knot such that its @xmath5-projection gives the original diagram  @xcite .",
    "two knot diagrams can be transformed into each other using the so - called reidemeister moves if and only if they represent equivalent knots  @xcite .",
    "the _ connected sum _ of two knots @xmath6 and @xmath7 is formed by removing a small piece of rope from both knots and then connecting the four endpoints by two new pieces of rope in such a way that no new crossings are introduced , the result being a a single knot , which is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "this operation is illustrated in figure  [ fig : sum ] .",
    "the connected sum @xmath9 is equivalent to @xmath10 and @xmath11 is equivalent to @xmath12",
    ". the connected sum of a knot @xmath1 and the trivial knot is equivalent to @xmath1  @xcite",
    ".        a knot is called _ prime _ if for any decomposition as a connected sum , one of the factors is the trivial knot .",
    "there are infinitely many prime knots .",
    "every knot @xmath1 can be decomposed as a connected sum of nontrivial prime knots . if @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are nontrivial prime knots , then @xmath17 , and after reordering each @xmath15 is equivalent to @xmath16 .",
    "this theorem motivates the following definition .",
    "let @xmath18 and let @xmath19 then , @xmath1 is a _ subknot _ of @xmath20 , or @xmath21 , if for any @xmath22 we have that @xmath23    a _ knot datatabase _",
    "@xmath24 is a finite collection of knots .",
    "the _ support _ of a knot @xmath1 in @xmath24 is defined as @xmath25    the _ frequent knot mining problem _ can be stated as follows : given a knot database @xmath24 and a threshold value @xmath26 , find all knots @xmath1 in @xmath24 such that @xmath27 .    for completeness",
    ", we also state the frequent itemset mining problem .",
    "a _ transaction database _ @xmath28 is a finite collection of @xmath29-tuples in @xmath30 .",
    "the _ support _ of an itemset @xmath31 in @xmath28 is defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 ( resp .",
    "@xmath34 ) denotes the @xmath35th component of @xmath31 ( resp .",
    "@xmath36 ) .",
    "the _ frequent itemset mining problem _ is then : given a transaction database @xmath28 and a threshold value @xmath26 , find all itemsets @xmath31 in @xmath28 such that @xmath37 .",
    "in this section we show how to transform a knot database @xmath24 into a transactional database .",
    "we assume that the knots in @xmath24 are represented by knot diagrams .",
    "we start by computing for each knot @xmath1 in @xmath24 its prime decomposition .",
    "schubert  @xcite gives an algorithm computing this decomposition .",
    "the running time is at worst exponential in the number of vertices in the knot diagram . in this way",
    ", we obtain a set @xmath38 consisting of knot diagrams for all prime knots occurring in @xmath24 .",
    "two different knot diagrams in @xmath38 can represent the same prime knot , so we have to eliminate duplicates .",
    "there exists an algorithm for testing whether two knot diagrams represent equivalent knots  @xcite .",
    "however , at present , the complexity of this algorithm is not known . from here on , we assume that @xmath38 does not contain duplicates and order it arbitrarily .",
    "we now define a mapping , denoted by @xmath39 , from knots in a knot database to elements in a transaction database .",
    "let @xmath24 be a knot database , and @xmath1 a knot in @xmath40 .",
    "then , @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the number of times the prime knot corresponding to the @xmath44th knot diagram in @xmath45 appears in the prime decomposition of @xmath1 . clearly , @xmath46 is a transaction database consisting of @xmath47 attributes .    given a set of knots @xmath48 , we now define the mapping , denoted by @xmath49 , from itemsets of a transaction database @xmath50 to knots in @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath51 and let @xmath52 be a @xmath29-itemset .",
    "then , @xmath53 for any knot @xmath1 , we have that @xmath54 .",
    "we now present the knotminer algorithm for computing the frequent knots in a knot database .",
    "knot database @xmath55 all knots @xmath1 such that @xmath27 .",
    "compute @xmath56 compute the set @xmath57 of frequent itemsets in @xmath28 output @xmath58 .    the first and last step in knotminer",
    "are already fully explained in section iii . for the second step one can either transform @xmath28 into a binary transaction database and",
    "use a standard mining algorithm like apriori  @xcite , eclat  @xcite or fp - growth  @xcite .",
    "alternatively one can mine @xmath28 directly using algorithms presented in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the following result is immediate .",
    "the knotminer algorithm works correctly .",
    "in this article we introduced the frequent knot mining problem and proposed the knotminer algorithm to solve it .",
    "currently , there exists no implementation of knotminer .",
    "this is mainly due to the complex algorithms needed for the encoding of a knot database into a transactional databases .",
    "however , recent research indicates that the knot decomposition of knotted polymers can be obtained by `` coulomb decomposition '' , which is a technique where polymers are brought into an equilibrium state using coulomb interactions  @xcite .",
    "we hope to apply this technique on simulated knotted polymers and hence obtain an implementation of knotminer , specifically aimed for mining knotted polymer databases ."
