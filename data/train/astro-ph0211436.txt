    "the detection of linear polarization in the radio emission from the galaxy confirmed the synchrotron origin of the emission @xcite . while theory suggested that the polarized fraction at the point of emission could reach @xmath870% , the detected fraction was far lower , and both discovery papers discussed the role of faraday rotation in the interstellar magneto - ionic medium ( mim ) in altering the polarization angle as well as its possible role in reducing the fractional polarization of the received emission . at the point of origin",
    "the electric vector is perpendicular to the local magnetic field , but the polarization angle changes as the radiation crosses regions where free electrons and magnetic fields are both present .",
    "the extent of this faraday rotation is @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the electron density , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 g ) is the component of the magnetic field parallel to the line of sight , @xmath22 ( pc ) is the path length , @xmath23 ( m ) is the wavelength , and the quantity rm ( radm@xmath10 ) is denoted the rotation measure .",
    "faraday rotation can lead to depolarization , a reduction in the apparent fractional polarization arising from vector averaging within the telescope beam of emission from different regions , or from superposition of emission which has suffered different faraday rotation in separate regions , or a combination of both .",
    "there has been a revival of interest in the polarized signals from the galactic `` background '' , based on new observations of high angular resolution made with large single antennas @xcite and with aperture - synthesis telescopes @xcite .",
    "a striking property of the polarization images from these observations is the almost complete absence of correlation between regions of polarized emission and features in total intensity .",
    "the accepted interpretation of this result states that the appearance of the sky is dominated by faraday rotation in the intervening medium , outweighing the effects of structure in the synchrotron emission regions .",
    "the structure in total intensity ( stokes parameter @xmath24 ) is generally smooth , while faraday rotation in the intervening medium imposes structure with fine scale on the linearly polarized emission ( stokes parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "aperture - synthesis telescopes preferentially detect small - scale structure , and are quite insensitive to the smooth @xmath24 component , leading to apparent fractional polarization in excess of 100% . the structure imposed by faraday rotation",
    "is the product of tangled magnetic fields and irregular electron - density distributions that arise from turbulence in the ism .",
    "furthermore , most modern radio telescopes are more sensitive to rotation measure than they are to emission measure : an ionized region well below the threshold of detectability in the total - power channel can cause a significant and measurable faraday rotation .",
    "polarimetry is consequently a useful new tool for probing the magneto - ionic component of the ism .    in this paper",
    "we present polarization images at a frequency of 1420mhz of a region of area 117 deg@xmath1 in the galactic plane ( @xmath2 , @xmath27 ) made as part of the canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps ) .",
    "angular resolution is about @xmath28 , an order of magnitude improvement over any existing polarization data for this region .",
    "the cygnus region covered by our observations is a very complex one , since the line of sight is nearly along the local arm . in section 2",
    "we describe the processing of the data and the construction of wide - field images .",
    "section 3 presents the results and describes some general properties of the polarized emission . in section",
    "4 we develop a general framework for the interpretation of these results .",
    "section  5 discusses our rotation measure results , and we proceed in section  6 to a discussion of individual polarization features .",
    "the cgps @xcite is a systematic mapping of the principal constituents of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the galaxy with an angular resolution close to @xmath28 , covering a large region in the first and second galactic quadrant ( @xmath29 , @xmath27 ) . among the data products from the drao synthesis telescope",
    "is a set of images in all four stokes parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath30 near 1420mhz .",
    "the telescope is described by @xcite .",
    "it receives continuum signals in both hands of circular polarization in four separate bands , each of width 7.5mhz , two on either side of a central band , which is placed on the emission , from which only images are derived . for the cgps observations ,",
    "the telescope is tuned to a velocity of about @xmath31kms@xmath32 ( frequency @xmath81420.64mhz ) , giving center frequencies for the continuum bands of 1406.89mhz , 1414.39mhz , 1426.89mhz , and 1434.39mhz .    to make @xmath24 images , visibilities from all four bands",
    "are separately gridded onto the @xmath33 plane and a combined image is computed , but @xmath25 and @xmath26 images are made separately in each band .",
    "the @xmath30 maps are dominated by flux which depends on errors in the telescope and its calibration , mostly arising from ellipticity of the feeds @xcite , and are usually of little value .",
    "since we expect the fraction of circular polarization generated in synchrotron emission regions to be very low , this is of no consequence .",
    "calibration of phase , intensity , and instrumental polarization is based on observations of the sources 3c147 and 3c295 , which are assumed to be unpolarized ; polarization angle is calculated using assumed values for 3c286 @xcite .",
    "image processing follows the practice conventional for aperture - synthesis data , to the point of image formation and deconvolution with clean .",
    "further processing , based on routines developed especially for the drao synthesis telescope @xcite , is described by @xcite .",
    "the essential processes are a visibility - based removal ( using the routine modcal ) of the effects of strong sources , both within and outside the main beam , and self - calibration , followed by a special clean procedure around extended sources .",
    "complex antenna gains , derived from self - calibration of the @xmath24 image , are applied to the @xmath25 and @xmath26 data .",
    "the effects of strong sources like cas  a and cyg  a are seen in @xmath25 and @xmath26 images even when these sources are well outside the main beam ; their effects can be removed using modcal . in a final step , modcal",
    "is used again to remove residual rings ( arising from polarization calibration errors ) around polarized point sources within the field .",
    "instrumental polarization varies across the field of view @xcite because of feed cross - polarization and aperture blockage by feed - support struts .",
    "this results in conversion of @xmath24 into @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the effects were measured by observing the unpolarized sources 3c147 and 3c295 at 88 positions in a grid of spacing @xmath34 across the field of view out to a radius of @xmath35 , and the correction derived from these observations is routinely applied to survey images . corrected sky images are assembled into mosaics with data from individual fields weighted to provide minimum noise level in the final image . for polarization mosaics , data from individual fields beyond a radius of @xmath36 in the main beam are not used .",
    "some instrumental polarization remains , but at a level less than 1% of @xmath24 .",
    "full details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the telescope samples baselines from 12.9 to 617 m with an increment of 4.286 m , and all structure from the resolution limit of @xmath4 up to @xmath37 is represented in the images .",
    "information from single - antenna data has been incorporated into the @xmath24 data ( as is standard practice for the cgps ) , but no attempt has been made to recover information corresponding to larger polarization structure , and single - antenna data have not been added to the @xmath25 and @xmath26 images discussed in this paper .",
    "we discuss existing single - antenna polarization data for the region in section  4 .",
    "polarized intensity , _ pi _ , is calculated as @xmath38 , where @xmath39k is the rms noise in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 images .",
    "the third term provides a first - order correction for noise bias @xcite . polarization angle in each of the four bands",
    "is calculated as @xmath40 .    when the signal - to - noise ratio is adequate , rm can be calculated from the four values of @xmath41 .",
    "the rm algorithm is based on a linear fit of polarization angles @xmath41 in the four bands against @xmath42 , followed by a routine which chooses among alternative values of rm which result from different resolutions of the @xmath43 ambiguity in the values of @xmath41 . if no fit produces @xmath44 that pixel is blanked in the rm image .",
    "the selection is then made on the basis of minimizing @xmath45 in the fit .",
    "values of @xmath46radm@xmath10 would lead to very large bandwidth depolarization ( see section 4 ) and are rejected . with only four bands , ambiguity resolution is sometimes difficult , leading to some uncertain rm values .",
    "we present here a large mosaic , covering @xmath47 , in the cygnus region .",
    "figures [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , and [ fig3 ] show @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 mosaics , made from more than 40 synthesis telescope images .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath26 mosaics are averages of the images made in the individual bands .",
    "polarized signals are low relative to the noise in the images , and in order to show the large - scale distribution of polarized intensity we have smoothed the @xmath25 and @xmath26 data to a resolution of @xmath48 and have computed an image of _ pi _ ; this is shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the polarization angle ( _ pa _ ) computed from @xmath25 and @xmath26 , at full resolution , as a grayscale .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows an image of rm . where the level of _ pi _ is low , a meaningful rm calculation is not possible , and pixels in the rm image",
    "are not shown where @xmath49k in the image of figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "this level corresponds to @xmath85 times the rms noise at @xmath48 resolution .",
    "readily apparent features of the @xmath24 image of figure  [ fig1 ] are many compact sources and a smaller number of bright , extended sources with sizes up to a few degrees .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] lists some of the extended sources ( some are marked in figure  [ fig1 ] ) , and gives distances and identifications of objects which are discussed or referred to in the following sections of this paper .",
    "there is also a very extended band of diffuse emission from the galactic plane , more than @xmath50 wide , crossing the image centered at @xmath51 .",
    "this is emission from the outer galaxy and its distribution in latitude reflects the northward warp of the disk .",
    "total intensity in the entire region shown in figure  [ fig1 ] never drops below @xmath52k . of this",
    ", 2.7k arises in the cosmic microwave background , and we expect the remaining 1.9k to be almost all non - thermal emission from the galaxy .",
    "examination of figures  [ fig1 ] to [ fig5 ] yields the following general conclusions .    *",
    "many compact sources show significant polarized emission . a study of the rms of these sources can be found in @xcite and @xcite ; we do not discuss these sources here , but we use some results from that paper .",
    "* for extended sources , the differences between total - intensity structures and polarization structures are more striking than the similarities .",
    "* there are large regions in which very little significant polarized emission has been detected ( apart from point sources ) .",
    "an example is the triangular region extending from the bottom of the images , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , up to @xmath55 .",
    "there appears to be a diagonal band of very low _ pi _ extending from @xmath56 to @xmath57 . at the upper end of the band _ pi _",
    "is particularly low , at @xmath58 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are below the noise .",
    "given that there is at least 2k of synchrotron emission from all directions in this region ( see above ) , depolarization must be very thorough . superimposed on this band",
    "is the snr ctb104a whose emission is strongly polarized .",
    "* there are many `` depolarization filaments '' visible in figure  [ fig4 ] as narrow threads of very low _ pi _ ; they are not detectable at full resolution because of noise .",
    "these `` filaments '' mark regions where polarization angle is changing rapidly .",
    "similar structures are seen in other data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of the polarization structure is apparently random , giving a mottled appearance to the @xmath25 and @xmath26 images .",
    "scale sizes extend from degrees down to the resolution limit of the data .",
    "* examination of the _ pa _ image ( figure  [ fig5 ] ) shows that angle changes in a rapid and chaotic manner over much of the field , but there are regions where the angle change is relatively slow over many beamwidths to @xmath59 can be distracting . ] .",
    "although the polarization structures seen in figure  [ fig5 ] are large , in some cases degrees in extent , the full angular resolution of the telescope , @xmath4 , is needed to detect most of them .",
    "almost none of these features can be seen in a _",
    "pa _ map computed from @xmath25 and @xmath26 data smoothed to @xmath48 resolution .",
    "the notable exception is the smooth feature at @xmath60 .",
    "* there appear to be small patches of polarized emission at the positions of the regions s112 and s115 .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath26 signals at these positions arise from a low level of residual instrumental polarization ( conversion of @xmath24 into @xmath25 and @xmath26 at a level below 1% ) .",
    "* there is a polarized `` filament '' about @xmath15 wide crossing the region w80 from north to south at @xmath61 .",
    "* there is a very complex polarized region centered at @xmath62 extending across the western edge of the field .",
    "* there is a large polarized patch at @xmath63 extending across the eastern edge of the field .",
    "* the large snrs hb21 and ctb104a have identifiable counterparts in @xmath25 and @xmath26 ; we have detected polarized emission from these snrs .",
    "it is noteworthy that polarized emission is _ not _ detected from other snrs in the region ; this fact is discussed below .",
    "* at @xmath64 we see a strongly polarized region of extent roughly @xmath65 .",
    "this polarized region has no @xmath24 counterpart .",
    "it lies quite near the snr hb21 , and in fact extends all the way to the eastern rim of the snr and is contiguous with polarized emission from the snr .",
    "g91.5 + 4.5 coincides in position with a molecular cloud with which the snr is interacting @xcite .",
    "polarized intensity here is @xmath80.3k , suggesting a fractional polarization of about 10% .",
    "* at @xmath60 we see a smooth elliptical structure about @xmath66 across that fades into the surrounding , more chaotic polarization .",
    "it stands out from the other polarized emission seen in figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] precisely because of its smooth structure . *",
    "centered at @xmath67 is a polarization feature which has a remarkably sharp and almost circular edge about @xmath68 in diameter , seen particularly well in the @xmath25 image ( see also figure  [ fig8 ]  this feature is discussed in section  6 ) .",
    "before discussing individual polarized regions or `` objects '' , we need to consider the general characteristics of the polarized emission in this part of the sky and establish a conceptual framework within which our results can be understood . we know that synchrotron emission is strongly polarized at its point of origin , but only about half of the area portrayed in figures  [ fig1 ] to [ fig4 ] shows detectable polarization .",
    "any interpretation of the polarization phenomena in this direction must explain both regions of high _ and _ low polarized intensity .",
    "interpretation of our data thus requires a full consideration of the mechanisms that create small - scale polarization structure and the mechanisms that remove it ( i.e.  depolarization ) .",
    "a central issue in interpretation is establishing the distance to the polarization features as this is the key to using the data to examine the physical properties of the mim .",
    "the ultimate source of the polarized emission is galactic synchrotron radiation .",
    "observations of the synchrotron emission from external galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show a high level of order in magnetic fields in galactic halos and thick disks .",
    "based on 408 mhz observations , @xcite have established that the synchrotron emission in the milky way is generated within a thin disk of scale height 180pc , accounting for 10% of the emission , and within a thick disk of scale height 1kpc which provides 90% of the emission ( these heights apply near the solar circle ) .",
    "the thin synchrotron disk more or less coincides with the gas disk .",
    "observations of external galaxies show magnetic structure usually aligned with the spiral arms , and the fractional polarization is sometimes stronger in inter - arm regions than in the arms themselves @xcite , implying that the irregular component of the field is stronger in the spiral arms , where it is generated by the turbulent motions associated with star formation .    we know from our @xmath24 images that the intensity structure of the synchrotron emission that we are detecting is smooth , but we have no information on the variability of polarization angle at the point of origin because we do not know how smooth the magnetic field is there .",
    "however , we can say that the magnetic field can not be completely irregular , or we would not detect any polarized emission at all .",
    "we note that we have detected fractional polarization up to about 10% ( calculated as the measured _ pi _ as a fraction of the @xmath24 data with single - antenna data incorporated ) . in the absence of small - scale structure in @xmath24",
    ", we proceed on the assumption that the intrinsic polarization ( i.e.  @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) is smooth or slowly varying .",
    "simple considerations give information on the physical location of the polarized emitting regions relevant to our data .",
    "we can easily find the galactic plane by inspecting the @xmath24 image , but there is no concentration of polarized structure towards the plane .",
    "this suggests that the polarized emission detected in this field must be nearby .",
    "( this is related to longitude : in the cgps data there are regions near @xmath69 where polarized emission appears strongly concentrated near the galactic plane , and so must be more distant ) .",
    "if the polarized emission is intrinsically smooth , the small - scale structure observed in @xmath25 and @xmath26 must then be produced by faraday rotation along the propagation path ( the exception is snr emission , where there definitely is fine structure in @xmath24 ) .",
    "the faraday rotation occurs in regions of the warm ionized medium ( wim ) , loosely referred to as `` faraday screens '' . the word `` screen '' suggests a thin foreground , distinct from the emitting region , but we consider the term to include deep regions . since synchrotron emission is generated everywhere in the galaxy , the screen will always be an emission region as well .",
    "the wim is confined to the galactic thick disk , of height @xmath701kpc @xcite .",
    "the filling factor is unknown , but is significantly lower than unity .",
    "the uneven distribution of ionized gas is related to star formation in the thin disk , and the effects of stars also create a high degree of disorder in magnetic field structure .",
    "we can anticipate that any line of sight will pass through one or more `` cells '' of wim .",
    "this is certainly the case for lines - of - sight that traverse the entire galactic disk ",
    "nearly all polarized extragalactic sources show significant rm @xcite .",
    "faraday rotation alone can not alter the amplitude of the polarized signal , but a number of physical and instrumental effects can reduce the fractional polarization of the recorded signal ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    * bandwidth depolarization occurs when the rm is so high that the polarization angle changes significantly across the received bandwidth , and the resulting non - parallel vectors are averaged .",
    "* depth depolarization ( also known as differential faraday rotation ) occurs when synchrotron emission and faraday rotation co - exist within the same volume of space .",
    "emission generated at different depths along the line of sight suffers different rotation , and vector averaging then reduces the observable polarized intensity .",
    "* beam depolarization occurs when many turbulent cells of the ism ( due to internal or external faraday dispersion ) and/or large rm gradients exist within the beam of the telescope , again leading to vector averaging .",
    "we need to evaluate each of these mechanisms for the drao synthesis telescope at 1420mhz , and for the region studied here .",
    "bandwidth depolarization is not a significant factor in the interpretation of the present data . in band - averaged data",
    "a rotation measure of @xmath71radm@xmath10 is required to produce 50% depolarization , with total depolarization occuring when @xmath72radm@xmath10 .",
    "the equivalent values in single - band data are @xmath73radm@xmath10 and 6600radm@xmath10 , respectively . for the general ism ,",
    "@xmath74radm@xmath10 usually holds ( see figure  7 , in which 93% of points lie in that range ) , producing a depolarization of @xmath75% in band - averaged data , and @xmath76% in a single band .",
    "an indication of which areas in our data are most affected by bandwidth depolarization can be obtained by comparing the rm image of figure  6 with the band - averaged images in figures  25 .",
    "depth depolarization is without doubt a major factor in these data . in a volume of ism with uniform synchrotron emissivity , electron density and magnetic field",
    ", the integrated emission is totally depolarized for a path length @xmath77 in this direction the line of sight is very close to the direction of the uniform component of the field ( determined to be @xmath78@xcite ) .",
    "we therefore take @xmath79 g , the full value of the uniform component @xcite . we take the mean value of the electron density to be @xmath80@xmath19 , the electron density near the sun from the model of @xcite .",
    "then total depth depolarization at 1420mhz occurs over a path length @xmath81kpc .",
    "however , we should be careful not to apply this result too literally , since the uniformity assumed in the calculation is very far from the truth .",
    "significant though it may be , depth depolarization requires integration along a path of at least 100pc to produce a 10% change in polarized intensity , and therefore can not create arcminute structure on the sky .",
    "the presence of widespread small - scale polarization structure requires small - scale structure in faraday rotation _",
    "transverse _ to the line of sight , and under these circumstances beam depolarization becomes significant , and is likely responsible for the smallest - scale structure that we see .",
    "the combined effects of depth depolarization and beam depolarization do not allow us to detect polarized emission features that originate beyond a certain distance .",
    "this applies equally to supernova remnant emission and to general galactic emission .",
    "in particular , beam depolarization will act in the same way on snr emission and on small - scale features generated in a localized faraday screen .",
    "we capture these ideas in the concept of the _ polarization horizon _ , and will attempt to establish its distance , @xmath6 . we emphasize that @xmath6 is wavelength dependent , beamwidth dependent , and direction dependent .",
    "in particular , a telescope of higher angular resolution will experience less beam depolarization and will `` see through '' to a larger distance and in general , at a fixed angular resolution , an observation at higher frequency will `` see '' to a larger distance .",
    "snrs provide a means of estimating the distance to the polarization horizon in our data .",
    "all snrs generate polarized emission at source , and are typically bright objects that subtend many beamwidths , but not all snrs in our data have detectable polarized emission .",
    "those that are not detected must either be intrinsically faint , or lie beyond the polarization horizon .",
    "table  [ tbl-2 ] lists snrs in the range @xmath82 , including some at latitudes beyond the boundaries of the present dataset .",
    "data are taken from the catalog of @xcite or from the references given in the table .",
    "the most straightforward conclusion from the data of table  [ tbl-2 ] is that the emission from snrs more distant than about 2  kpc is not detected .",
    "the weakness of this argument is that a very dense region , w80 , lies in front of three of the snrs in table  [ tbl-2 ] ( g84.2@xmath140.8 , g84.9 + 0.5 , and g85.9@xmath140.6 ) , and it is hardly surprising that beam depolarization occurs on passage of the emission through such a region ( see more detailed discussion in section  6 ) .",
    "furthermore , g85.4 + 0.7 and g85.9@xmath140.6 are snrs of very low surface brightness , among the faintest known , and our observations simply do not have the sensitivity to detect polarization from these snrs .",
    "this leaves only g94.0 + 1.0 as a reasonably bright snr that lacks detected polarization and is not seen through an region ; its distance is 5.6kpc @xcite , placing it in the perseus arm .",
    "( some polarized emission is seen coincident with both g84.2@xmath140.8 and g94.0 + 1.0 , but is not believed to be associated with the snrs ; see section  6 ) .",
    "a safe conclusion is that beam depolarization will eliminate polarization from snrs beyond the local arm in the region we are examining ; i.e.  the polarization horizon is at a few kpc distance , and is likely within the local arm .",
    "regions can also be of use in determining @xmath6 .",
    "electron densities in regions are much higher than in the surrounding ism , and motions are turbulent , resulting in very tangled magnetic fields . since magnetic fields are frozen into the ionized gas , and move with it , quite high field strengths can result from compression .",
    "the resulting high faraday rotation with variations on small spatial scales causes strong beam depolarization , making polarized emission from behind the region undetectable , and creating an area of very low _ pi _ whose outline matches that of the region .",
    "this signature effect has been used by @xcite , @xcite , and by @xcite to establish distances to faraday screens , and places a lower limit on @xmath6 .",
    "examination of the present data shows that , while there are many bright regions in the field ( see table  [ tbl-1 ] ) , they are _ not _ seen as depolarization features .",
    "this implies that the faraday screens which define the polarization structure in this region are significantly _ closer _ to us than the regions , which are mostly at distances of 2 to 3 kpc ( see section  6 for a detailed discussion of w80 , which shows strong coincident polarization ) . thus the regions do not allow us to place a strong limit on @xmath6 .",
    "weighing the evidence , we conclude that , for lines - of - sight in the galactic plane in this region , the polarization horizon is probably about 2kpc distant , and all the polarization features seen in figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] are generated within the local arm .",
    "we note that our coverage in galactic latitude of @xmath27 implies that our lines - of - sight are within the thin disk out to distances of about 2kpc .",
    "we are therefore seeing synchrotron radiation that arises predominantly in the thin disk .",
    "the drao synthesis telescope at 1420mhz has a much greater sensitivity to rm than to emission measure : it can detect ionized material in its polarization channels which it can not detect in total power .",
    "for example , at 1420mhz an ionized region of extent 10pc with @xmath83@xmath19 and @xmath20 = 2@xmath21 g will produce a faraday rotation of @xmath84 , which is easily detectable .",
    "this same region produces an emission measure of 2.5@xmath85pc , which is only one tenth of the rms thermal noise in the @xmath24 image . this great sensitivity to faraday rotation , along with the fact that faraday screens do not affect total intensity , leads to the effect remarked on earlier , that the polarized sky has a completely different appearance from the total - intensity sky . while this great sensitivity facilitates study of the mim , it is often impossible to isolate a single region or object causing the faraday rotation along the line of sight .",
    "the following conditions are required to generate a polarization feature that is detectable with the synthesis telescope : ( a ) the presence of a faraday screen within the polarization horizon , ( b ) structure within that faraday screen on size scales between @xmath28 and about @xmath5 , and ( c ) the absence of confusing faraday screens along the line of sight .",
    "the third point merits some elaboration .",
    "faraday screens are transparent structures , and one faraday screen can strongly modify the appearance of another on the same line of sight .",
    "for example , the smooth appearance of g91.8@xmath142.5 must be produced by a faraday screen whose structure is extremely smooth .",
    "that smooth structure could easily be altered , if not completely obscured , by the presence of another screen anywhere along the line of sight within the polarization horizon , either closer or more distant than g91.8@xmath142.5 , with fine structure .",
    "we take the absence of confusing faraday rotation along the line of sight as evidence that the filling factor of ionized gas is quite low . in the same vein ,",
    "the short path to w80 favours the detection of polarized emission from the foreground mim : along a longer path , the superposition of the effects of several faraday screens could cause partial or total depolarization .",
    "this leads us to a conjecture about the regions where we detect only very low levels of polarized emission , the `` empty '' regions .",
    "faraday rotation is not absent from these regions , as witnessed by the rms of extragalactic sources seen through them @xcite .",
    "small - scale angular structure in faraday rotation exists in many directions , detected through an analysis of the variation of rms between the individual components of extragalactic sources @xcite .",
    "small - scale variations are also reported by @xcite . since",
    "faraday rotation is present in the `` empty '' regions , and probably has small - scale structure , we interpret the absence of detectable polarization as an indication that a number of patches of wim exist along the line of sight , to the point where the emission is almost totally depolarized .",
    "this is still consistent with a low filling - factor for the wim , as there may in fact be no faraday screens within the polarization horizon .",
    "that is , we are `` seeing '' the depolarization at the polarization horizon , and any polarized emission arising closer to us is too smooth to be detected by the interferometer .        there have been six discussions of the distance to polarized galactic emission ( including the present work ) on the basis of data obtained with antenna beams smaller than @xmath86 .",
    "these results are summarized in table  [ tbl-3 ] . among these results , the present work stands out as showing very nearby emission regions .",
    "can this be understood in terms of the conceptual framework that we have outlined above ?",
    "the only work that has examined part of the galaxy beyond the solar circle is that of @xcite , also based on cgps data .",
    "these authors describe polarized features related to the region w4 ( near @xmath87 ) which is definitely a perseus arm object .",
    "w4 is seen as a depolarizing feature , so the polarized emission must arise behind it . in this direction",
    "the telescope evidently `` sees through '' the local - arm faraday rotation .",
    "there are several reasons to expect the polarization horizon to be closer at @xmath88 to @xmath89 than at @xmath87 .",
    "first , the local magnetic field is directed towards @xmath90 @xcite , so that , in the region we are considering , the line of sight is nearly parallel to the uniform component of the field , and faraday rotation will be higher .",
    "second , in these directions , the line of sight passes for a considerable distance through the local spiral arm ( or spur ) , which is directed towards @xmath91 . on the other hand , along sight lines toward @xmath92 the path through the local arm is fairly short .",
    "furthermore , the line of sight is at an angle of about @xmath93 to the direction of the uniform component of the magnetic field and we expect that rms will be lower ; this is confirmed by @xcite on the basis of analysis of rms of extragalactic sources .",
    "inter - arm fields are probably quite smooth , and little depolarization will occur there . in these directions ,",
    "the polarization horizon at 1420mhz must lie in the perseus arm , or even beyond it .",
    "the other work at a wavelength very similar to ours is that of @xcite who looked towards the inner galaxy ( at @xmath94 , almost directly opposite the region consdered by * ? ? ?",
    "they estimate that most of the polarized emission is in the crux arm ; surprisingly , they `` see through '' the closer carina arm , although again the large angle to the field direction helps .",
    "@xcite used absorption to establish a minimum distance to the polarized emission in one direction in the same field ; absorption by gas in the carina arm was detected , placing the emission regions in or beyond that arm .",
    "the extensive surveys of @xcite used shorter wavelengths .",
    "because of dependence of faraday rotation on @xmath95 we expect the polarimeter to `` see '' more distant emission . because of the use of single - antenna telescopes",
    ", we might expect greater sensitivity to large - scale emission , and @xcite detected an apparently isotropic , and so nearby , component .",
    "the emission in the first quadrant mapped by @xcite is associated with the sagittarius arm by the correlation of depolarization with emission .",
    "this locates it at distances between 2.5 and 8 kpc .",
    "comparing our results with the others listed in table  [ tbl-3 ] , we reach the conclusion that the local arm has a substantial magneto - ionic component , and is a strong faraday rotator .",
    "this is contrary to some other ideas of galactic structure around the sun : for example , the electron density model of @xcite shows no enhancement of electron density corresponding to the local arm .",
    "there is some low - resolution polarization data for the region discussed here , and we now consider its relevance to the above discussion .",
    "@xcite present single - antenna polarization data for most of the northern sky at several frequencies from 408 to 1411mhz ( hereafter the dwingeloo data ) . at the highest frequency",
    "the angular resolution is @xmath96 .",
    "sampling is irregular , with a minimum interval between points of @xmath66 . in the @xmath97 region",
    "considered here there are only 14 data points ; sampling at half - power beamwidth would have given data at about 1300 points .",
    "the extreme under - sampling makes a meaningful comparison with our data quite difficult . in a slightly larger area ( @xmath98 ) there are 24 data points at 1411mhz in the dwingeloo data . in that area the average _ pi",
    "_ is 0.143k , and the average polarization angle is @xmath99 ( angle increases east of galactic north ) with a scatter of @xmath100 rms .",
    "the average angle weighted by _ pi _ is @xmath101 . within the uncertainties , these results are consistent with an electric vector perpendicular to the galactic plane ,",
    "that is with a magnetic field aligned parallel to the plane .",
    "there is reason to believe that the low - resolution data sample very nearby regions ( see section 5 ) .",
    "the multi - frequency nature of the data allows us to calculate rm in regions with sufficiently high polarized signal .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "where @xmath102 is strongest , rm values tend to be negative ; positive values tend to be found in areas of low polarized intensity , and must be regarded with some caution .",
    "we use the rm data to reach some general conclusions about the region , but in this paper we will not attempt to interpret the rm data for individual objects .    in this region @xcite have determined the rm of 107 compact sources , using an algorithm that is entirely independent of ours , but of course is basically similar .",
    "it is probable that all of these compact sources are extragalactic .",
    "rm values range from @xmath103 to + 371radm@xmath10 , and the mean and median values are @xmath104 and @xmath105radm@xmath10 respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] compares the distribution of rm of the extended emission ( the data of figure  [ fig6 ] ) with the distribution of rm of the compact sources .",
    "the rm of the extended polarized emission has a distribution which peaks at @xmath9radm@xmath10 and has a width to half - maximum of @xmath11radm@xmath10 .",
    "in contrast , the peak and half - width of the distribution of rms of compact sources are @xmath12radm@xmath10 and @xmath13radm@xmath10 respectively .",
    "the greater spread in compact - source rm is possibly the result of faraday rotation within the sources themselves , but this should not greatly affect the location of the histogram peak since the source sample is large ( 107 sources ) .",
    "we interpret the substantial difference in the rm distributions as follows : ( i ) the extragalactic source emission has suffered greater faraday rotation as a result of propagation along a longer path , extending from the outer edge of the galaxy to the sun , a path of perhaps 10  kpc , while ( ii ) the extended emission has traversed a shorter path , no more than 2 kpc , the distance to the polarization horizon .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the conclusion that there is no reversal of the uniform component of the galactic field beyond the local arm @xcite . under these circumstances",
    "the rm will tend to increase monotonically with distance of propagation through the galactic disk , and rm becomes a ( weak ) indicator of distance . in the region covered by the cgps , the second galactic quadrant",
    ", we expect that the mim in the local arm and the perseus arm will dominate polarization effects .",
    "the magnetic field falls to low values at large galactocentric radius , and we expect relatively little faraday rotation in the extreme outer galaxy .",
    "in contrast to our results , rms determined by @xcite from the dwingeloo data are between @xmath106 and + 10radm@xmath10 .",
    "this suggests that the dwingeloo observations detect polarized emission generated very close to the sun , while the drao observations detect polarized emission generated at larger distances . in the language we have developed above",
    ", we would say that the polarization horizon for the dwingeloo telescope is very close ; this is understandable when the effects of beam depolarization in a @xmath96 beam are considered .    from the absence of depolarizing effects of regions",
    ", @xcite deduced that the polarized emission detected by single - antenna radio telescopes ( with beams of @xmath107 to @xmath66 at frequencies of 240 to 1400 mhz ) lie closer than 500 pc .",
    "these authors derive rm data compatible with that of @xcite over a smaller area .",
    "these results were obtained for an area near @xmath108 , but are probably applicable over a considerable part of the galactic plane .",
    "in this section we discuss individual `` objects '' or regions within the survey area .",
    "regions are considered in order of their galactic longitude and are named in the manner conventional for galactic objects .",
    "centered at @xmath109 is a polarization feature which has a remarkably sharp and almost circular edge , seen particularly well in the @xmath25 image ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "a @xmath25 map covering a smaller area is shown in figure  [ fig8 ] .",
    "the nearly circular boundary is very obvious ; the boundary can be fitted very closely with a circle of diameter @xmath110 over about 70% of the circumference .",
    "once again , there is no counterpart in @xmath24 .",
    "this sharp circular boundary strongly suggests a stellar - wind phenomenon , and there is a b8 star , hd196833 , at @xmath111 , about @xmath112 from the center of the circular feature .",
    "the distance of this star , from hipparcos measurements , is @xmath113pc @xcite . at this distance",
    "the diameter of the structure would be 8pc .",
    "the change in polarization angle at the circle is @xmath114 .",
    "the corresponding change in rm at 1420mhz is 24rad m@xmath10 . for an assumed constant magnetic field of 2@xmath21 g",
    ", this implies an enhanced electron density of 1.8@xmath19 .",
    "the excitation parameter required to keep this volume ionized is 6cm@xmath10pc if the volume is a uniform sphere , or about 4cm@xmath10pc if it is a spherical shell . at a distance of 330pc",
    ", this demands a star of type approximately b1 @xcite .",
    "a b8 star produces a flux of ionizing photons inadequate by more than 5 orders of magnitude , so hd196833 can not have created the spherical feature . in principle g83.2",
    "+ 1.8 could be the result of a _ deficit _ of electrons , produced when a stellar wind swept out a spherical region .",
    "however , this would require an external electron density of 1.8@xmath19 , an improbably high value .",
    "even though the source of ionization that maintains g83.2 + 1.8 can not be identified , it nevertheless seems very likely that the polarization feature has a stellar origin .      before discussing detailed results for the polarization superimposed on w80",
    ", we will examine the assertion , made in section  4 , that beam depolarization in w80 eliminates the polarization of any synchrotron emission generated behind it .",
    "@xcite have developed a model for w80 , interpreting the region as a giant molecular cloud being disrupted by 8 early - type stars . using the electron densities and path lengths from their model , and assuming a magnetic field of @xmath116 g , the faraday rotation through the center of the nebula is 17radians , corresponding to an rm of 400radm@xmath10 .",
    "the high densities in this model ( varying from 6 to 40@xmath19 ) mean that the field is likely to be higher than the value we have assumed , and we consider 400radm@xmath10 to be a lower bound for the rm of the region .",
    "given the turbulence that is likely to be associated with the disruptive activity of the stars , we can assert with confidence that the ionized gas in w80 will completely `` hide '' polarized emission arising behind it through beam depolarization .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] shows @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and",
    "_ pa _ images of an area including the region w80 and stretching to the western boundary of the field .",
    "there is no strong correlation of polarized features with total - intensity objects , except for a handful of compact sources .",
    "the most intense polarized feature is a complex `` filament '' which crosses w80 .",
    "@xcite measured the synchrotron emissivity at 22mhz by measuring the brightness temperature towards optically thick regions which absorb all emission arising behind them .",
    "one of the regions used was w80 , where a value of 21,800k / kpc was obtained .",
    "however , this value was based on a distance of 800pc for w80 , and adjusting to the value of 500pc which we are using , the emissivity becomes 34,900 k / kpc .",
    "translating this figure to 1420mhz using @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) gives an emissivity of 0.30k / kpc .",
    "the filament in front of w80 causes an angle change of about 100@xmath119 along most of its length , increasing to about 200@xmath119 at its northern end .",
    "image leaves the impression that we are looking through a faraday rotating sheet , with the magnetic field in the sheet possibly aligned with the line of sight .",
    "the measured peak _ pi _ on the filament is @xmath120k . assuming a fractional polarization at origin of 70%",
    ", the emitted synchrotron radiation must contribute a brightness temperature , @xmath121 , of 0.07k .",
    "given the value for the synchrotron emissivity , it is immediately clear that the synchrotron emission we are detecting must be generated along about half of the line of sight to w80 .",
    "we note the presence of an extremely small polarized filament , @xmath122 long and unresolved in width , at @xmath123 , well portrayed in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 images of figure  [ fig9 ] . assuming a distance of 250pc , the length of this filament is @xmath81.8pc and its width is less than 0.07pc .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] shows a @xmath102 image of the snr g84.2@xmath140.8 with superimposed contours of @xmath24 .",
    "it is apparent that a peak of _ pi _ lies near the northern shell of the snr , where its total intensity peaks .",
    "this gives the impression that we have detected polarized emission from the snr , contrary to the assertion made in section  4 .",
    "but is this really snr emission , or is it foreground emission superimposed by chance on the snr ?",
    "it is instructive to look at the images of figure  [ fig9 ] , which cover a wider area .",
    "inspection of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 images show that , while polarized structure roughly coincides with g84.2@xmath140.8 , the polarized emission around the snr extends well beyond the perimeter of the snr .",
    "second , the scale - size of the polarized structures is not much smaller than the snr .",
    "this is in marked contrast to hb21 and ctb104a where polarization structures as small as the telescope beam ( @xmath28 ) are clearly seen .",
    "further , the angle image shows that there is a filament of altered angle of extent about @xmath124 at almost constant @xmath125 , crossing right through g84.2@xmath140.8 .",
    "we are satisfied that the polarized emission is probably unrelated to the snr , but there is no way of reaching a conclusive answer to this question .",
    "this case illustrates the difficulty of making polarization observations of snrs at frequencies as low as 1420mhz .",
    "unless there is a very substantial contrast between snr emission and the surroundings , either in polarized intensity or in polarization structure ( as is the case for hb21 and ctb104a ) it is almost impossible to decide whether polarized signals arise from the snr or from the surrounding ism",
    ". detected polarization features might be in front of or behind the snr . in any event , it is advisable to image a wide area around any snr being investigated .",
    "hb21 is at the northern edge of the region described here .",
    "we will present detailed polarization results for hb21 in a forthcoming paper ( uyaniker et  al . in preparation ) , but here we describe some features which are relevant to the more general discussion of the region .",
    "strong polarized emission from hb21 is clearly seen in figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig11 ] shows @xmath24 and _ pi _ images over a smaller region whose boundaries have been chosen to include hb21 and part of the adjacent molecular cloud .    polarized emission from hb21 is strongest at the bright eastern rim , and polarized intensity drops toward the western edge .",
    "strong polarized emission extends across the eastern edge of the snr , but the polarized emission on the snr shows more fine structure than the emission from the adjacent `` background '' .",
    "surprisingly , the snr _ depolarizes _ emission arising behind it . a sharp drop in polarized intensity",
    "can be seen coinciding with the outer edge of the snr shell ( the faint bubble at @xmath126  see figures  [ fig11 ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "this is probably the result of turbulent magnetic fields of relatively high intensity behind the snr shock , leading to beam depolarization . at the distance of hb21 (",
    "800pc * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the @xmath28 beam corresponds to @xmath80.2pc .",
    "the cell size behind the snr shock must be considerably smaller than this to produce the observed depolarization , perhaps as small as 0.02pc .",
    "figure  [ fig12 ] shows @xmath24 , @xmath26 , and _ pi _ images around g91.5 + 4.5 , a strongly polarized region of extent @xmath16 .",
    "this polarized region has no @xmath24 counterpart .",
    "it lies quite near the snr hb21 , and in fact extends all the way to the eastern rim of the snr and is contiguous with polarized emission from the snr .",
    "the two regions offer an interesting contrast : both show equally strong polarization structure , but one has a strong @xmath24 counterpart and the other has none within the sensitivity limits of the drao telescope .",
    "g91.5 + 4.5 coincides in position with part of a molecular cloud , @xmath127 in size ( from @xmath128 to @xmath129 and @xmath130 to @xmath131 ) . @xcite",
    "have shown that hb21 is interacting with this molecular cloud , and that both objects lie at a distance of about 0.8kpc .",
    "we suggest that the polarization feature is produced by a faraday screen in some way associated with the molecular cloud .",
    "we regard the positional coincidence as reasonably strong evidence of this .",
    "the molecular cloud , at a distance of 0.8kpc , is the dominant object along the line of sight that is closer than the polarization horizon ( 2kpc ) .",
    "can a molecular cloud be a faraday screen ?",
    "for the sake of discussion , we assume the following parameters : gas density 100@xmath19 , fractional ionization @xmath132 , and magnetic field 100@xmath21 g @xcite . for a path length through this molecular cloud of 100pc ( probably an overestimate ) , the rotation measure is @xmath133radm@xmath10 , producing an angle change at 1420mhz of only @xmath134 , compared to the measured value of @xmath135 .    new molecular observations ( presented in part in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show molecular material overlapping the polarized feature g91.5 + 4.5 and extending to the east .",
    "inspection of the @xmath25 image of figure  [ fig12 ] shows curved features centered near @xmath136 , extending at least @xmath15 in latitude .",
    "these features envelop molecular material , and we interpret the @xmath25 features as the product of faraday rotation in a thin ionized layer on the outside of the molecular cloud .",
    "we have been able to find a reasonable physical model to match the observed parameters of this faraday screen .",
    "the observed facts are a faraday rotation @xmath137 and an absence of detectable @xmath24 emission .",
    "the upper limit for @xmath24 emission from the faraday screen material is 0.1k , the 2-@xmath138 noise level in the @xmath24 image .",
    "the corresponding maximum emission measure ( @xmath139 ) is 56@xmath85pc .",
    "the extent of the molecular cloud on the sky is @xmath140 , giving a physical size of 40pc .",
    "thicknesses of the ionized layer of 1 to 4pc are reasonable , implying maximum electron densities between 8 and 4@xmath19 , and an expected rotation of @xmath141 for a magnetic field of 7@xmath21 g ( field slightly enhanced in the relatively dense region ) .",
    "although we do not have sufficient information to tie down its properties precisely , it seems clear that this faraday screen is capable of imparting the observed properties to the polarized emission .",
    "we discuss this model in more detail in a forthcoming paper ( uyaniker et  al .  in preparation ) .",
    "a strongly polarized elliptical structure at @xmath142 stands out from the other polarized emission seen in figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] because of its smooth structure .",
    "it has a size of nearly @xmath66 but lacks a sharp boundary .",
    "this structure is studied in detail by @xcite ; we present a summary of their discussion .",
    "g91.8@xmath142.5 has a central peak of polarized intensity , and an outer shell - like structure .",
    "peak polarized intensity is 0.08k , and polarization angle changes across the object by @xmath143 , corresponding to @xmath144rm @xmath145 40radm@xmath10 .",
    "there is no counterpart in total intensity , and the polarized object appears to have no relation to visible objects in the field , including the region lbn416 and the star cluster m39 ( ngc7092 ) .",
    "g91.8@xmath142.5 could be the product of a fluctuation of either electron density or magnetic field , with either parameter increasing or decreasing .",
    "the required magnetic field change is 10@xmath21 g or greater , and this considerably exceeds the random component of about 4@xmath21 g .",
    "a region which has a deficit of electrons must be filled with neutral gas , and none is apparent in either atomic or molecular form , so the most likely possibility is an enhancement of electron density .",
    "the distance to g91.8@xmath142.5 is unknown , but limits can be placed on it .",
    "an upper limit is , of course , 2kpc , the distance to the polarization horizon . a path of at least 400pc is needed to generate the synchrotron emission detected in g91.8@xmath142.5 , moving the maximum distance to 1.6kpc .",
    "however , this is a weak constraint : the object must be much closer to show such a smooth structure .",
    "a lower limit can also be placed on the distance , with some assumptions .",
    "the first assumption is that the depth of the region along the line of sight is equal to its transverse dimension ( it is approximately spherical ) .",
    "if it is an enhancement of electron density in a magnetic field of 3@xmath21 g , then its distance must be at least 200pc or the bremsstrahlung from the ionized gas would be detectable , either at radio wavelengths or optically .",
    "the smooth structure of the magnetic field would be difficult to maintain in a large object , so this fact favours a close distance .",
    "a distance of @xmath146pc is deduced .",
    "the enhancement of electron density is 1.7@xmath19 and the mass of ionized gas is 23m@xmath147 .",
    "g91.8@xmath142.5 bears a strong resemblance to the object described by @xcite , which we denote here as g137.6 + 1.1 .",
    "the characteristics of the two objects are quite similar , except that g91.8@xmath142.5 produces only one third of the faraday rotation of g137.6 + 1.1 .",
    "the discovery of a second object of this type suggests that these smooth , elliptical faraday - rotation regions may be common .",
    "both objects are probably of similar nature , a smoothly distributed concentration of ionized gas in a very uniform field .",
    "the approximately spherical form of these faraday - rotation regions suggests that they have a stellar origin .",
    "the polarized emission from ctb104a has been described by @xcite .",
    "an outline is given here for completeness , and the results reported in that paper are put in the more general context .    as is evident from figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , the polarized emission from the snr shows very strong small - scale structure .",
    "the rm is also chaotic on small scales , but shows a remarkably well - ordered gradient across the remnant , changing smoothly from about @xmath148radm@xmath10 in the south - east to @xmath8 + 170radm@xmath10 in the north - west .",
    "the orientation of the rm gradient is aligned with the magnetic axis of the remnant at @xmath149 north of west , defined by the bright total - intensity shells .",
    "this gradient in rotation measure is attributable to changing magnetic field orientation in a compressed shell , presumably the snr shell .",
    "this fits the @xcite model very well , where a uniform ambient magnetic field is compressed by the expanding blast wave .",
    "figure  [ fig13 ] shows an @xmath24 image of a region around the snr 3c434.1 and the region nrao655 with superimposed polarization vectors .",
    "polarized emission coincides positionally with 3c434.1 , but there is stronger polarization immediately to the east of the snr . taking these data at face value",
    ", one would have to say that the region nrao655 appears to be as strongly polarized as the snr .",
    "the data clearly demand a more sophisticated interpretation , and it is obvious that here the polarization image is dominated by effects closer than the snr and the region .",
    "both are at a distance of 5.6kpc @xcite .",
    "we have described the polarization properties at 1420mhz of emission from the galactic plane in a complex region in cygnus , a direction where the line of sight is directed along the local spiral arm .",
    "the drao synthesis telescope is extremely sensitive to faraday rotation , allowing the detection of ionized regions which can not be detected by their total - power emission .",
    "consequently , the appearance of the polarized sky is dominated by faraday rotation in the warm ionized medium , rather than by structure in the synchrotron emitting regions which are the ultimate source of the radiation . by considering the effects of faraday rotation",
    ", we have developed a general framework for understanding our results .",
    "a key concept is the _ polarization horizon _",
    " polarization features generated beyond that point can not be detected .",
    "the distance to the polarization horizon depends on the wavelength and the telescope beamwidth , and on direction .",
    "we have shown that snrs and regions whose distances are known can be used to constrain the distance to the polarization horizon . in this direction , this distance is about 2kpc , and the observed polarization features lie within the local arm .",
    "the detectability of polarization features requires the presence of a faraday rotation `` screen '' along the line of sight with structure on a scale that the telescope can detect .",
    "if many such screens lie along the line of sight , the detected polarization will be very low .",
    "the detection of regions of substantial polarized intensity ( as high as 10% of the smooth galactic synchrotron background ) then implies that the filling factor of faraday screens , and so of the warm ionized medium , is low .",
    "the distribution of rm of the extended emission peaks at negative values , but the rms of compact sources in the field tend to be more negative .",
    "this implies that , in this direction , rm increases as the propagation path through the ism increases , and is consistent with the absence of a field reversal between the local and perseus arms .",
    "rms from single - antenna data are much lower , implying that these observations , with beamwidths of @xmath107 to @xmath66 have detected emission arising at very near distances .    localized features in this region exhibit a surprising variety of attributes , some not seen before .",
    "polarized emission is associated with a molecular cloud .",
    "a feature larger than @xmath15 displays a sharp circular transition of polarization angle .",
    "a feature whose size is nearly @xmath66 has exceptionally smooth polarization structure .",
    "we have offered interpretations for some , but not all , of these within the conceptual framework that we have established .",
    "while many of the observed phenomena have extents of several degrees , arcminute angular resolution is essential in detecting and understanding them .",
    "the two nearby snrs in this direction whose polarized emission can be detected reveal small - scale structure which differs from the polarized emission from their surroundings",
    ". nevertheless , it can be difficult to separate polarized emission from snrs from their polarized surroundings , and polarization observations of snrs at frequencies as low as 1420mhz must employ high angular resolution and cover substantial areas of sky to identify clearly any polarization arising in the snr .",
    "polarization phenomena which are contained in a more or less circular region on the sky , or have a radial structure , strongly suggest that a star has influenced the surrounding environment .",
    "g83.2 + 1.8 and g91.8@xmath142.5 are examples , although in neither case can a central star be found .",
    "many more such objects should be investigated closely , with the aim of elucidating the role that stars play in shaping polarization features .",
    "the novelty of the polarized sky still presents challenges , and we regard our interpretations of the observed features as provisional . much more work must be done , through the observation of a wider area of the galactic plane , complemented by modelling of the emission and faraday rotation regions .",
    "while this one field can not provide a sufficient number of examples to lead to representative astrophysical data , we believe that our approach has laid the foundation for future work .",

    "<S> we present 1420mhz ( @xmath0 cm ) observations of polarized emission from an area of 117  deg@xmath1 in the galactic plane in cygnus , covering @xmath2 , @xmath3 , a complex region where the line of sight is directed nearly along the local spiral arm . </S>",
    "<S> the angular resolution is @xmath4 , and structures as large as @xmath5 are fully represented in the images . </S>",
    "<S> polarization features bear little resemblance to features detected in total power : while the polarized signal arises in diffuse galactic synchrotron emission regions , the appearance of the polarized sky is dominated by faraday rotation occurring in small - scale structure in the intervening warm ionized medium . </S>",
    "<S> there is no concentration of polarization structure towards the galactic plane , indicating that both the emission and faraday rotation occur nearby . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a conceptual framework for interpretation of the observations . </S>",
    "<S> we can detect only that polarized emission which has its origin closer than the _ polarization horizon _ , at a distance @xmath6 ; more distant polarized emission is undetectable because of depth depolarization ( differential faraday rotation ) and/or beam depolarization ( due to internal and external faraday dispersion ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 depends on the instrument used ( frequency and beamwidth ) as well as the direction being studied . in our data </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath7kpc , consistent with the polarization features originating in the local arm . </S>",
    "<S> the filling factor of the warm ionized medium is constrained by our data to be considerably less than unity : polarized signals that pass through multiple regions of faraday rotation experience severe depolarization , but polarized fractions up to @xmath810% are seen , implying that there are lines of sight that intersect only one faraday rotation region within the polarization horizon . the rotation measure ( rm ) of the extended polarized emission has a distribution which peaks at @xmath9radm@xmath10 and has a width to half - maximum of @xmath11radm@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the peak and half - width of the distribution of rms of extragalactic sources in the region are @xmath12radm@xmath10 and @xmath13radm@xmath10 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that rm increases monotonically with length of propagation path through the interstellar medium in this direction .    among </S>",
    "<S> localized polarization features that we discuss , g83.2 + 1.8 and g91.8@xmath142.5 , stand out for their circular or quasi - circular form and extent of more than @xmath15 ; both are probably related to the impact of stellar activity on the surrounding medium , although the stars responsible can not be identified . </S>",
    "<S> another polarization feature , g91.5 + 4.5 , extends @xmath16 , and coincides with a molecular cloud ; it plausibly arises in an ionized skin on the outside of the cloud . </S>",
    "<S> polarized emission seen across the face of the large , dense region , w80 , must be generated in the 500pc between the sun and w80 , since w80 must depolarize all extended non - thermal emission generated behind it . </S>",
    "<S> of the supernova remnants g84.2@xmath140.8 , g89.0 + 4.7 ( hb21 ) , g93.7@xmath140.2 ( ctb104a ) , and g94.0 + 1.0 ( 3c434.1 ) , only hb21 and ctb104a show polarized emission ; the other two lie beyond the polarization horizon and their emission suffers beam depolarization . </S>",
    "<S> emission from the surrounding medium is depolarized on passage through hb21 . </S>"
