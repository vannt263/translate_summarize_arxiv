    "[ sect1 ] energy harvesting ( eh ) is an appealing solution for enabling self - sustainable wireless devices in communication networks .",
    "thereby , the inconvenience of recharging and replacing batteries can be avoided by harvesting energy from different energy sources , such as solar and wind . recently , wireless power transfer ( wpt ) via radio frequency ( rf ) signals has received considerable attention as it provides an ubiquitous , relatively stable , and controllable source of energy @xcite . moreover , additional benefits can be reaped by employing information - carrying signals for wpt , which enables simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) @xcite .    swipt introduces a paradigm shift for system , receiver , and resource allocation algorithm design for communication systems due to the newly imposed challenges in delivering information and energy concurrently . in particular , there is a fundamental trade - off between eh and information decoding ( i d ) , as was shown in @xcite .",
    "thereby , resource allocation plays a particularly important role for improving the system performance of swipt networks . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed a power allocation algorithm for near - field communication systems .",
    "however , the authors of @xcite and @xcite assumed that the receivers are able to harvest energy from the received signal , while simultaneously decoding the embedded information , which is not feasible in practice , yet , due to practical limitations of eh circuits .",
    "consequently , hybrid power splitting receivers and separate receivers were proposed for swipt in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "additionally , a simple time - switching receiver was proposed for alternating between i d and eh across different time slots @xcite . for multiuser downlink swipt systems , suboptimal",
    "order - based scheduling schemes to balance the trade - off between the ergodic achievable rates and the average amounts of harvested energy of the users were proposed in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , adopting the same system model as in @xcite , optimal multiuser scheduling schemes guaranteeing a long - term minimum harvested energy for swipt were reported in @xcite .",
    "the fundamental element of swipt systems that enables rf - eh is the eh circuit .",
    "the eh circuit includes a rectifier as the component that converts the power of the received rf signal to direct current ( dc ) power with a certain conversion efficiency @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the design of resource allocation algorithms in swipt systems relies on an accurate mathematical model for the characteristics of the eh circuit implemented at the eh receiver .",
    "for instance , practically all existing works , e.g. @xcite , @xcite@xcite , assume a specific linear eh model for the rf - to - dc power conversion .",
    "however , practical eh circuits usually result in non - linear end - to - end wpt @xcite@xcite .",
    "therefore , the traditional linear eh model adopted in the literature for resource allocation algorithm design may not be able to capture the non - linear characteristics of the rf - to - dc power conversion in practical rf - eh systems .",
    "recently , a practical non - linear eh model was proposed in @xcite , along with a beamforming algorithm for a downlink multi - antenna swipt system serving multiple information receivers ( irs ) and multiple energy harvesting receivers ( ers ) .",
    "specifically , the beamforming algorithm in @xcite was designed for short - term maximization of the total harvested power at the ers , while guaranteeing minimum required signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratios ( sinrs ) at multiple irs .",
    "the results in @xcite revealed that resource allocation algorithms designed for the simple linear eh model , which is widely used in the literature , may lead to resource allocation mismatches for practical non - linear eh circuits .",
    "however , the problem of joint user scheduling and long - term power allocation for swipt systems with practical non - linear eh circuits has not been considered in the literature , yet .",
    "although scheduling schemes that exploit multiuser diversity for improving the performance of multiuser swipt systems were studied in @xcite , the authors adopted the existing linear eh model for the end - to - end wpt , which may lead to suboptimal performance in practice .",
    "in this paper , we adopt the practical non - linear eh model from @xcite and study the optimal algorithm design for joint user scheduling and long - term power allocation in order to facilitate eh and to exploit multiuser diversity in multiuser downlink swipt systems .",
    "thereby , the resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as a non - convex optimization problem with a sum - of - ratios objective function .",
    "exploiting a recent result from the mathematical literature @xcite , this difficult non - convex problem is solved optimally by a computationally efficient iterative algorithm after transforming the sum - of - ratios objective function into an equivalent objective function in subtractive form .",
    "simulation results reveal significant improvements in performance , when the non - linear eh model is adopted for resource allocation algorithm design instead of the simple linear eh model .",
    "in this section , we present the adopted channel model and introduce the considered non - linear eh model .",
    "we consider a downlink multiuser system , where a single - antenna base station broadcasts the rf signal to @xmath0 single - antenna receivers capable of i d and eh , cf . figure  [ fig : system_model ] .",
    "we note that the receivers may also exploit other energy sources such that their power supply does not solely rely on the power harvested through rf - eh .",
    "transmission in the system is divided into @xmath1 orthogonal time slots . in every time slot @xmath2 , we perform joint user scheduling and power allocation to optimize the system performance .",
    "we assume a frequency flat slow fading channel .",
    "the downlink received symbol at user @xmath3 in time slot @xmath4 is given by    [ fig : system_model ]    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the transmitted symbol , @xmath7 is the transmit power , and @xmath8 is the channel gain coefficient including the joint effects of multipath fading and path loss for user @xmath9 in time slot @xmath4 . for the transmitted symbol , we assume a zero mean symbol with unit variance , i.e. , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 stands for statistical expectation . furthermore , @xmath12 represents the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) in time slot @xmath4 at user @xmath9 with zero mean and variance @xmath13 . assuming perfect channel state information ( csi ) at the user , the maximum achievable data rate ( bit / s / hz ) , i.e. , the instantaneous capacity , for user @xmath9 in time slot @xmath4 is given by @xmath14 in each time slot , a single receiver is selected as the ir . exploiting the broadcast nature of the wireless channel ,",
    "the remaining @xmath15 receivers are scheduled as ers to opportunistically harvest rf energy .",
    "figure  [ fig : wpt_system ] depicts the eh receiver part of a general swipt system . in general",
    ", the rf - eh circuit consists of a bandpass filter , a rectifying circuit , and a low - pass filter followed by a battery @xcite .",
    "the bandpass and low - pass filters perform passive filtering of the signal in order to achieve impedance matching and removal of high frequency harmonic components , respectively .",
    "after bandpass filtering , the rf signal is rectified yielding dc power as output .",
    "the harvested energy at the er is typically modelled based on a linear energy harvesting model @xcite , @xcite@xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the received rf power at the er and @xmath18 $ ] is a fixed constant that reflects the quality of the rf - to - dc conversion circuit , i.e. , the power conversion efficiency .",
    "[ fig : wpt_system ]    eq .",
    "implies that the energy conversion efficiency is independent of the input power level at the er . however , it is expected that practical eh circuits introduce non - linearity into the end - to - end wpt , cf .",
    "in particular , due to limitations in practical eh circuits , the rf power conversion efficiency improves with increasing power with diminishing returns until it reaches a saturation value @xcite , which corresponds to the maximum possible harvested energy .",
    "in contrast , according to the linear eh model in assumed in the current literature , the harvested power can arbitrarily linearly increase with the input rf power .",
    "hence , adopting the linear eh receiver model may lead to a resource allocation mismatch . in order to be able to capture the effects of practical eh circuits on the end - to - end power conversion , we adopt the practical non - linear eh model",

    "the practical non - linear eh model can capture the joint effects of different non - linear phenomena caused by hardware constraints including circuit sensitivity limitations and current leakage @xcite by adjusting the parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath25 denotes the maximum harvested power at an er when the eh circuit is saturated , while @xmath23 and @xmath24 are related to the detailed eh circuit specifications .",
    "parameters @xmath25 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 can be easily obtained by standard curve fitting based on measurement data for a given eh circuit implementation . as an example",
    ", figure  [ fig : curve_fit ] shows that the curve fitting for the non - linear eh model in with parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 closely matches experimental results provided in @xcite for the wireless power harvested by a practical eh circuit .",
    "figure  [ fig : curve_fit ] also illustrates the inability of the linear model in to accurately model the characteristics of practical eh circuits over the entire range of input powers .    [",
    "fig : curve_fit ]",
    "in the following , we adopt the non - linear eh model in and study the resource allocation algorithm design for the downlink multiuser swipt system in figure  [ fig : system_model ] . joint user scheduling and power allocation is performed assuming availability of full csi at the base station . furthermore , since @xmath29 does not affect the design of the optimal user scheduling and power allocation , cf .",
    ", for notational simplicity and without loss of generality , we directly use @xmath20 , @xmath30 from to represent the harvested power at the ers .",
    "the system design objective is to maximize the average total harvested power in the system for the practical non - linear eh model .",
    "hence , we formulate the resource allocation algorithm design as the following optimization problem , with respect to the user selection and the power allocation variables , @xmath31 and @xmath7 , @xmath22 , respectively : @xmath32 variable @xmath33 in the objective function is the total rf power received at er @xmath9 in time slot @xmath4 . in the considered problem , we focus on the long - term system performance for @xmath34 . constraints c1 and c2 are imposed to guarantee that in each time slot @xmath4 , at most one user is served by the transmitter for i d .",
    "c3 is a constraint on the average radiated power @xmath35 , and c4 constrains the maximum transmit power @xmath36 in each time slot , which may be limited because of hardware constraints .",

    "c5 ensures that the average data rate of user @xmath9 needs to satisfy the minimum required data rate @xmath38 .",
    "the objective function in is a sum - of - ratios function which is a non - convex function .",
    "furthermore , the binary integer constraint @xmath39 makes the optimization problem combinatorial in nature . in order to efficiently solve problem ,",
    "we transform it into a more tractable equivalent optimization problem .",
    "the first step in obtaining a solution for the considered non - convex problem in is to transform the sum - of - ratios objective function .",
    "_ objective function transformation : _ in general , computationally efficient algorithms , such as the dinkelbach method @xcite or the charnes - cooper transformation , can be adopted to solve non - linear optimization problems having a single - ratio objective function and a convex feasible set .",
    "however , these popular approaches can not be applied to sum - of - ratios objective functions .",
    "the method recently introduced in @xcite , on the other hand , offers a solution to the sum - of - ratios problem and was shown to achieve the global optimum .",
    "following the same procedure as in @xcite , in the following theorem , we introduce a transformation for the objective function in .",
    "[ thm : non_linear_sum_of_ratios ] let @xmath40 and @xmath41 be the optimal solution to the optimization problem in .",

    "in addition , the optimization variables @xmath40 and @xmath41 must satisfy the system of equations : @xmath46    _ proof : _ please refer to @xcite for a proof of theorem [ thm : non_linear_sum_of_ratios ] .",
    "theorem [ thm : non_linear_sum_of_ratios ] states that for the maximization problem with a sum - of - ratios objective function in , there exists an equivalent optimization problem with an objective function in parametric subtractive form , such that both problem formulations lead to the same optimal user selection and power allocation policy . as a result",
    ", we can focus on the equivalent objective function in in the rest of this paper .",
    "moreover , the optimization problem can be solved efficiently by an iterative resource allocation algorithm , as will be shown in the next section .      in the following , we focus on the design of a computationally efficient algorithm for achieving the globally optimal solution of the resource allocation optimization problem in .",
    "the algorithm consists of two nested loops . in the inner loop ,",
