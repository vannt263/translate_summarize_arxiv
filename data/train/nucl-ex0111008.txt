    "the determination of the thermodynamical properties such as temperature , density , and excitation energy of the hot nuclear systems produced in nucleus - nucleus reactions is one of the main goals of heavy - ion ( hi ) physics . at moderate excitation energies , @xmath2 3_a _ - 15_a _ mev ,",
    "the experimental derivation of these observables as well as their correlation is a prerequisite for a quantitative investigation of the nuclear equation of state @xmath4 = @xmath4(@xmath5,@xmath3 ) in connection with a possible liquid - gas phase transition @xcite . to date the most unambiguous evidence for such a phase transition in hi collisions is given by the `` caloric curve '' @xcite which relates the thermal energy of an excited nucleus to its temperature , @xmath6 = @xmath6(@xmath3 ) .",
    "for very low @xmath6 , the caloric curve of nuclei is found to follow very closely @xcite the @xmath7 fermi law given by the well - known bethe formula for the nuclear density of states @xcite .",
    "such a trend is maintained at moderately low nuclear excitation energies ( @xmath83_a _ mev ) @xcite . in the region",
    "@xmath2 3_a _ - 8_a _ mev , however , the curve flattens @xcite suggesting a phase transition ( the width of the `` plateau '' indicating the latent heat related to the phase change ) .",
    "although such thermodynamical behaviour has also been observed in other microscopic systems such as metallic @xcite and hydrogen @xcite clusters , the empirical determination ( and the theoretical interpretation ) of the nuclear caloric curve has been a much debated issue the last years @xcite . as a matter of fact , the three experimental methods employed so far to measure the temperatures attained in a reaction do not yield fully equivalent caloric curves .",
    "the existing nuclear `` thermometers '' are based on : ( i ) the slopes of the kinetic energy spectra of light particles ( n , p , @xmath9 ) @xcite , ( ii ) the double ratios of neighbour isotopes @xcite , and ( iii ) the relative populations of excited states @xcite .",
    "having in hand an alternative thermometer based on a clean and weakly interacting probe would be extremely useful when searching for signals of the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "electromagnetic probes , viz . photons and dileptons , due to their weak final state interaction with the surrounding medium , have long been recognized as the most direct probes of the space - time evolution of the colliding nucleons @xcite . in hi reactions at intermediate bombarding energies , two concurrent processes are known to be responsible for hard - photon emission @xcite : ( i ) first - chance ( off - equilibrium ) collisions between projectile and target nucleons in the first stages of the reaction , and ( ii ) subsequent @xmath10 collisions in the produced ",
    "nuclear fireball \" zone .",
    "the experimental existence of a second thermal component emitted from the produced hot nuclear sources and accounting for up to 30% of the total photon yield above @xmath11=30 mev , has been unambiguously observed recently @xcite . in this letter",
    "we propose to exploit such radiation as a novel thermometer of hot nuclear matter using a realistic thermal model which reproduces satisfactorily the observed photon spectral shapes and yields .",
    "using such a thermometer we then construct the caloric curve in the region of the expected liquid - gas phase change .",
    "photons produced in hi reactions escape freely the interaction region immediately after their production . thus , even when emitted from an equilibrated source they do not have a blackbody spectrum at the source temperature . however , the inverse slope parameter of their spectrum @xmath12 and the temperature @xmath3 of the nuclear medium are strongly correlated . in this work",
    "we employ the thermal model of neuhauser and koonin @xcite ( henceforth nk ) to quantitatively relate @xmath12 and @xmath3 . according to this model",

    "the temperatures obtained for all the systems studied by the taps collaboration where a thermal hard - photon component has been measured @xcite lie in the range @xmath1 4 - 7 mev ( table [ tab : enterria:1 ] ) in agreement with the typical values found in intermediate - energy nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite . the highest @xmath3 ( @xmath12 ) values for a given incident",
    "energy @xmath45 correspond to the most symmetric systems , which have the highest energy deposition in the center - of - mass , @xmath46 , i.e. , the largest attainable excitation energies . in comparison with the nuclear thermometers used so far @xcite",
    ", the thermal - photon thermometer presents several advantages : ( i ) minimal preequilibrium contamination due to the large difference , by a factor two to three , between the direct ( first - chance ) and thermal hard - photon slopes @xcite ; ( ii ) absence of final - state distortions like side feeding , rescattering , and reaccelaration by the coulomb field and/or collective motion ; ( iii ) measurement of the @xmath3 of the system right after equilibration , just before its break - up @xcite , when the maximum thermal energy of the equilibrated residue is achieved ; and ( iv ) intrinsic selection of ( semi)central dissipative reactions with large number of @xmath10 collisions @xcite .",
    "the use of thermal photon slopes as a nuclear thermometer is however restricted to intermediate - energy reactions with @xmath47 30_a_-90_a _ mev . the lower limit in @xmath45 results from the experimental difficulty to resolve accurately the thermal component in a double - exponential fit of the hard - photon spectrum due to : ( i ) the very small cross - section in the direct high - energy region 30 mev per @xmath37 collision is a steeply increasing function of the incident energy @xmath48 @xcite : @xmath49 $ ] . ] , and ( ii ) the increasing role at e@xmath50 20 mev of statistical @xmath51 from decays of giant dipole resonances and bound states . above @xmath47 90_a _",
    "mev , hard - photon spectra are well described by a single `` direct '' exponential @xcite and also the background of photons from the decay of the produced @xmath52 s becomes important @xcite .",
    "the absolute thermal photon yield per nuclear reaction , @xmath53 , predicted by the nk model can be obtained integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : koonin1 ] ) over the relevant space - time history of the equilibrated system produced in a nucleus - nucleus reaction :    @xmath54    in the most general case @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and the integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma multiplicity ] ) requires a consistent modeling of the space - time evolution of the reaction as done , e.g. , in hydrodynamical approaches .",
    "since we are just interested in verifying that the thermal model provides also a correct estimation of the measured thermal photon yields , we will significantly simplify the calculation of @xmath57 making a few plausible assumptions .",
    "first , one may neglect any @xmath3 and @xmath5 gradients within the nuclear source and approximate the integral over space by the volume of the participant nucleons in the reaction , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the sum of target and projectile nucleons as a reliable measure of the ( relative ) size of the system in the different reactions . ] .",
    "secondly , one can simply replace the integral over time by a constant interval equal to the lifetime of the radiating source , @xmath60 100 fm / c , consistent with the usual estimates of the lifetime of equilibrated excited nuclei @xcite . with these rough approximations , partial integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : koonin1 ] ) above @xmath11= 30 mev permits to compute @xmath57 straightforwardly . since the emission rates given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) scale as @xmath61 and since @xmath62 , the thermal @xmath51 multiplicities are rather insensitive to the density of the source in this very simple estimation . most experimental multiplicities ( table [ tab : enterria:1 ] ) are very well reproduced by the integrated nk photon rates and our simplified ansatz of the space - time history of the radiating source in table [ tab : enterria:1 ] include the uncertainties in @xmath3 propagated from @xmath12 and are quite large due to the strong power dependence of the photon emission rates on @xmath3 . ] .",
    "the photon yields of the two systems with largest excitation energies ( @xmath63kr+@xmath64ni and @xmath65ar+@xmath64ni at 60_a _ mev ) , however , are overpredicted by the model ( though still within the combined @xmath66 and @xmath67 systematic uncertainties ) .",
    "a much better agreement would be reached in these two cases if the lifetime of the equilibrated sources was reduced by a factor @xmath332 compared to lower energies ( i.e. if @xmath68 50 fm / c ) .",
    "this result is in quantitative agreement with the observed fast break - up of nuclear systems for increasingly larger values of @xmath6 interpreted in terms of a low - density ( spinodal ) fragmentation @xcite .",
    "having determined the values of @xmath3 from @xmath12 through eq .",
    "( [ eq : t vs e0 t ] ) for our different reactions , a caloric curve @xmath69 , can be constructed correlating @xmath3 with the _ thermal _ excitation energies @xmath6 attained in each reaction .",
    "to construct such a curve , we use the published values of @xmath6 measured in semi - central and central reactions with equivalent systems ( table [ tab : enterria:1 ] , most right column ) . in the case of @xmath63kr+@xmath64ni at 60_a _ , in the absence of an experimental measurement of @xmath6 , an upper value can be obtained from the total ( coulomb - corrected ) center - of - mass energy , @xmath70 , subtracted of other energy contributions , where : ( i ) the reaction q - value and @xmath71 are of the order @xmath331_a _ mev and have opposite signs , and ( ii ) the radial flow energy , @xmath72 , and the pre - equilibrium component , @xmath73 , represent @xmath333_a _ mev for a symmetric system at these energies @xcite . ] .",
    "although it is fair to acknowledge that our globally indirect determination of @xmath6 is potentially subject to significant systematic uncertainties , such uncertainties are reasonably contained in the already intrinsically large experimental errors of the excitation energy measurements @xcite and , furthermore , the qualitative conclusions that we obtain from the analysis of the photon caloric curve would only be modified by much larger shifts along the @xmath6 axis .",
    "the @xmath6 - @xmath3 correlation for the 7 reactions considered here is shown as solid dots in fig .",
    "[ fig : new caloric curve ] .",
    "our caloric curve falls somewhat above the aladin @xcite and eos @xcite results ) to account for several corrections in @xmath3 ( sequential feedings ) and @xmath6 ( collective radial flow energy ) , see e.g. @xcite for a compilation of the most recent results . ] obtained with two different isotopic ratios , but still clearly below the region expected for a pure degenerate fermi fluid ( fig .",
    "[ fig : new caloric curve ] , dark band ) .",
    "the fact that the thermal photon temperatures seem to be slightly larger than the isotopic ones is not surprising since `` chemical '' temperatures probe a later lower density ( cooler ) stage when isotopes are produced , whereas the most significant part of thermal photon emission takes place somewhat earlier .",
    "indeed in this scenario , the radiation of thermal bremsstrahlung photons occurs during the path followed by the excited nuclear system between the hot `` liquid '' phase ( one single big nuclear fragment at the end of the pure pre - equilibrium stage ) and the mixed phase of gaseous particles and small droplets produced later in the fragmentation process @xcite .",
    "our caloric curve disagrees , on the other hand , with the one obtained by the indra collaboration using kinetic temperatures @xcite , which follows closely the @xmath74 trend .",
    "the kinetic @xmath3 s are systematically higher by about 1 - 2 mev most likely due to the fact that the slope parameters of @xmath75 and @xmath9 kinetic energy spectra are influenced by preequilibrium and mid - rapidity emissions @xcite , and/or nucleon fermi motion effects .",
    "the departure of the photon caloric curve from the @xmath76 law ( with level density parameters @xmath77 mev@xmath78 ) characteristic of the nuclear ground state ( liquid phase ) , and the slow increase of @xmath3 with @xmath6 in the region of intermediate excitation energies are in qualitative agreement with the expected behaviour of a liquid - gas phase transition occurring in excited atomic nuclei .",
    "a thermal bremsstrahlung model has been employed to extract the thermodynamical properties of the nuclear systems produced in heavy - ion collisions at intermediate - energies .",
    "such a model predicts exponential hard - photon spectra above @xmath11 = 30 mev in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the thermal slopes are linearly correlated with the temperature of the emitting system .",
    "this defines a new thermometer of hot nuclear matter which , at variance with the usual hadronic - based methods , is free of significant final - state distortions .",
    "the hot nuclear residues prepared in different reactions with excitation energies @xmath79 3_a _ - 8_a _ mev , have temperatures in the range @xmath1 4 - 7 mev yielding a slowly increasing caloric curve which lies below the expected behaviour for a pure fermi liquid .",
