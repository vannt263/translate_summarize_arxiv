    "the classification of small bodies in the inner solar system as either asteroids or comets has historically been attempted by different scientists using different techniques and employing different criteria .",
    "observational astronomers classify small bodies having transient , unbound atmospheres ( usually made visible by the scattering of sunlight from entrained micron - sized dust particles ) as `` comets '' .",
    "bodies having instead a constant geometric cross - section are called `` asteroids '' . to planetary scientists ,",
    "comets and asteroids are distinguished by their ice content or perhaps by their formation location .",
    "comets are icy ( because they formed beyond the `` snow - line '' ) while asteroids are not ( supposedly because they formed at higher mean temperatures inside it ) .",
    "lastly , to dynamicists , comets and asteroids are broadly distinguished by a dynamical parameter , most usually the tisserand parameter measured with respect to jupiter ( kresak 1982 , kosai 1992 ) .",
    "it is defined by    @xmath1^{1/2}\\cos(i ) \\label{tisserand}\\ ] ]    where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the semimajor axis , eccentricity and inclination of the orbit while @xmath5 = 5.2 au is the semimajor axis of the orbit of jupiter .",
    "this parameter , which is conserved in the circular , restricted 3-body problem , provides a measure of the close - approach speed to jupiter .",
    "jupiter itself has @xmath6 = 3 .",
    "main belt asteroids have @xmath7 and @xmath8 3 while dynamical comets have @xmath9 .    the three systems of classification ( observational , compositional and dynamical ) are independent but imperfect .",
    "for example , whether a coma or tail is detected on a given object depends strongly on the parameters of the observing system used .",
    "a puny telescope may not reveal a coma that is easily rendered visible by a more powerful one .",
    "there is neither an agreed quantitative ice fraction with which to divide comets from asteroids nor , more importantly , any reliable way to measure the ice fraction in a small body .",
    "the formation locations and dynamical histories of small bodies are rendered uncertain by hard - to - model non - gravitational forces from both electromagnetic radiation ( the yarkovsky effect ) and mass loss itself ( the rocket effect of whipple 1950 ) and also by the chaotic nature of solar system dynamics .",
    "the tisserand criterion is an imperfect classifier because it is based on an idealized representation of the solar system ( e.g.  jupiter s orbit is not a circle , the gravity of other planets is not entirely negligible , and so on ) .",
    "therefore , the utility of equation ( [ tisserand ] ) as a dynamical discriminant is limited for objects with @xmath6 very close to 3 . as an example , the quasi - hilda comets at @xmath10 4.0 au have @xmath11 2.9 - 3.04 but are clearly interacting with jupiter through the 3:2 mean - motion resonance ( toth 2006 ) .",
    "some recognized jupiter family comets ( e.g. 2p / encke with @xmath6 = 3.03 ) also fall in this category ( fernandez et al .",
    "2002 , levison et al .",
    "2006 ) .    given these and other imperfections",
    "it is remarkable that , for a majority of objects , the observational , compositional and dynamical definitions of asteroids and comets lie in close agreement . for the most part , objects classified as asteroids ( comets ) based on their orbits , have the physical properties expected of asteroids ( comets ) as far as can be observed .",
    "exceptions have given rise to a somewhat confusing and evolving system of nomenclature , used to describe small solar system bodies by a combination of their orbital properties and physical appearances .",
    "to clarify this we show , in figure ( [ classification ] ) , a two - parameter classification based on morphology , on the one hand , and the tisserand parameter on the other .",
    "traditional comets lose mass and have @xmath12 3 .",
    "those with 2 @xmath13 3 are called jupiter family comets and are thought to originate in the kuiper belt .",
    "comets with @xmath12 2 are long - period or halley family comets , with a source in the oort cloud .",
    "inactive counterparts to the jupiter family comets are called , variously , extinct , dead or dormant comets ( hartmann et al .",
    "they are presumably former comets in which past heating by the sun has removed all near surface ice , although buried ice might remain and these objects could , in principle , reactivate .",
    "inactive counterparts to the long - period and halley family comets are called damocloids ( jewitt 2005 ) .",
    "again , these are likely objects in which near - surface ice has been lost .    in this paper , we focus attention on the sub - set of the small - bodies which are dynamically asteroid - like ( @xmath14 3 ) but which lose mass , like comets .",
    "these were called `` main - belt comets '' by hsieh and jewitt ( 2006 ) but here we use the term `` active asteroids '' , since some of the examples to be considered , while dynamically asteroid - like and showing comet - like properties , are not in the main - belt .",
    "numerical integrations show that these are not recently captured comets from the kuiper belt ( fernandez et al .",
    "2002 , levison et al .",
    "scientific interest in these objects lies in the possibility that primordial water ice could have survived in asteroids despite early heating from embedded radioactive nuclei ( grimm and mcsween 1989 ) and heating by the sun .",
    "even greater interest is added by the possibility that the outer asteroid belt may have supplied part of the volatile inventory of the earth ( morbidelli et al .",
    "2000 ) . additionally , active asteroids are a source of dust for the zodiacal cloud , while unseen counterpart bodies may supply dust to the debris disks of other stars ( e.g. shannon and wu 2011 ) .",
    "after briefly summarizing the current observational evidence concerning these active asteroids , we discuss the surprisingly varied mechanisms through which a body is capable of losing mass .",
    "a recent and complementary discussion focused on observational properties has been offered by bertini ( 2011 ) .",
    "to - date , eleven active ( or mass - shedding ) asteroids have been reported .",
    "the nine spatially resolved examples are shown for comparison in figure ( [ image_compo ] ) , while their positions in the semimajor axis vs.  eccentricity plane are plotted in figure ( [ mbc_ae_plot ] ) .",
    "the comet - like morphologies and their orbital separation from the domain of the comets are obvious in these two figures .",
    "all eleven objects are located inside the 2:1 mean - motion resonance with jupiter at 3.3 au and all but three lie below the mars - crossing line ( marked @xmath15 in the figure ) .",
    "the orbital properties of these objects are summarized in table ( [ orbital ] ) , the physical properties in table ( [ physical ] ) and we review them briefly here , in order of decreasing @xmath6 .    * ( 3200 ) phaethon : @xmath6 = 4.508 * is dynamically associated with the geminid meteor stream ( e.g. williams and wu 1993 ) and with several other small asteroids including 2005 ud ( ohtsuka et al .",

    "all these objects may be related to a precursor body that disintegrated @xmath010@xmath16 yrs ago ( ohtsuka et al .",
    "evidence for modern - day mass loss comes from the observed brightening of phaethon by a factor of two within a few hours of perihelion ( @xmath17 = 0.14 au ) in 2009 ( jewitt and li 2010 ) .",
    "this rapid brightening can not be due to scattering from the @xmath05 km diameter nucleus alone and , instead , indicates transient mass loss with the ejection of @xmath010@xmath18 kg of particles each @xmath19 mm in radius .",
    "with @xmath19 = 1 mm , this is only 10@xmath20 of the geminid stream mass , but raises the possibility that the decay of phaethon is a continuing process .",
    "the phenomenon has not been observed to repeat , but comparable observations when near perihelion are difficult to secure because of the small angular separation from the sun .",

    "one simplification possible for the present objects is the assumption that asteroids contain no amorphous ice , since temperatures in the asteroid belt are too high for it to escape crystallization .",

    "second , the size of the largest ejectable particle is estimated by balancing the gas drag force with the gravity , assuming spherical particles and nucleus and neglecting all other forces .",
    "we take the densities of the ejected grains and of the bulk nucleus , in the absence of contrary evidence , to be equal .",

    "the equation offers , at best , a crude estimate of the critical radius ; the highly anisotropic outflow of gas from a real nucleus can strongly affect dust acceleration and dynamics relative to the simple isotropic case used here ( e.g. crifo et al .",
    "still , it is obvious from figure ( [ critical ] ) that sublimation gas drag can easily remove small solid particles across the full range of distances swept by the main - belt asteroids .",
    "grains larger than @xmath73 remain bound to the asteroid and contribute to the development of a refractory mantle , eventually leading to a stifling of the sublimation .    while exposed ice sublimates quickly , ice protected from direct illumination by a covering or mantle of refractory debris can survive nearly indefinitely .",
    "a meter - thick layer of regolith can suppress sublimation sufficiently to retain ice for gyr timescales ( schorghofer 2008 ) .",
    "then , to initiate sublimation , this protective mantle must be removed , which could occur naturally through impact .",

    "thermal dehydration is accompanied by a net volume change which can crack the dehydrating material and provide a source of small particles . however , the above activation energies correspond to temperatures ( @xmath01000 k ) , much higher than normally found in the asteroid belt . for this reason ,",
    "thermal dehydration is unlikely to play a role in a majority of the active asteroids since they have perihelia @xmath1382 au and temperatures too low to trigger dehydration .",

    "pressures this high are confined to a region comparable in size to the projectile diameter , so that the volume of shock - dehydrated target material is small compared to the volume of the resulting impact crater .",
    "nevertheless , water released by impact could sustain mass loss from an asteroid for a timescale longer than that on which the impact ejecta dissipates .",

    "larger particles can be lost if the nucleus is rotating and has an aspherical shape .",
    "the above considerations are simplistic in that they take no account of the direction of the radiation pressure acceleration relative to the nucleus .",
    "grains released on the day - side , for instance , will be pushed back into the nucleus by radiation pressure from above . on the other hand , grains released near",
    "the terminator will feel a net force in a direction determined by the vector sum of the local gravitational acceleration and radiation pressure acceleration .",

    "the same must be said for observations of p/2008 r1 , where sublimation can fit the data ( jewitt et al .",
    "2009 ) but where an impact origin may also apply .",
    "we also regard the nature of activity in p/2008 r1 as unknown .",

    "isophote models involve the assumption of numerous , unknown parameters and provide solutions which are non - unique .",
    "this is especially true for objects viewed at small angles to their orbital planes , as are most of the active asteroids .",
    "clear evidence of the weakness of models is the fact that moreno et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , using limited data , were able to fit the isophotes of p/2010 a2 with a model in which particles were released over an eight month period , inconsistent with the finding of an impulsive origin based on more and better imaging data ( jewitt et al .",
    "2010 , snodgrass et al .",
    "2010 ) . with this as a cautionary reminder",
    ", we regard the evidence concerning activity in 176p , p/2008 r1 , p / la sagra and 300163 as insufficient to diagnose the cause .",
    "evidence concerning 107p and ( 2201 ) oljato is even more fragmentary , and the cause of their activity also unknown .",
    "the results of this and the previous section are summarized for convenience in table ( [ summary ] ) and shown schematically in figure ( [ summary_figure ] ) .",
    "the figure shows the plane of object radius , @xmath84 , vs.  heliocentric distance , @xmath17 , with the regions of action of the different physical processes considered in section ( [ mechanisms ] ) marked as color fields . the eleven reported",
    "active asteroids are plotted at the heliocentric distances at which activity was observed .",
    "the figure shows that , for example , ( 596 ) scheila lies in a region of the @xmath84 vs.  @xmath17 plane in which only impact and sublimation are capable of ejecting particles .",
    "( as described above , detailed studies of the morphology and time - dependence of the coma of scheila show that impact is the true explanation ) .",
    "conversely , a majority of the active asteroids lie in regions of the @xmath84 vs.  @xmath17 plane where many processes are potentially important . for example , in 238p , sublimation , electrostatic ejection , rotational instability , radiation pressure and impact process are all potentially active . only through detailed physical investigation",
    "is it possible to discriminate between these possibilities ( in favor of sublimation , in the case of 238p , based principally on the repetition of the observed mass - loss ) . for many active asteroids ,",
    "the physical observations needed to discriminate amongst mechanisms do not exist .",
    "collisions are implicated in active asteroids both directly , as in the case of ( 596 ) scheila and , perhaps , p/2010 a2 , and indirectly as a trigger for activity ( for example , to expose buried ice ) , as in 133p and 238p . here ,",
    "we briefly examine the expected rate of collision between asteroids .    the typical collision probability per unit area in the asteroid belt",
    "is @xmath162 3@xmath2310@xmath163 km@xmath45 yr@xmath22 , with variations by a factor of several reflecting a collisional environment that varies with location in the belt ( bottke et al .",
    "the interval between impacts onto an asteroid of radius @xmath84 is    @xmath164    where @xmath165 is the number of impactors larger than @xmath96 .",
    "estimates of the size distribution of the asteroids are many and varied , with significant uncertainties resulting from the unmeasured albedos of most asteroids , as well as from severe observational bias effects ( jedicke et al .",
    "the uncertainties are particularly acute for sub - kilometer asteroids because such objects are faint and remain largely unobserved . for radii",
    "@xmath166 1 km , the best - fitting differential power law index is about -2 , albeit with significant , size - dependent deviations from this value . for radii",
    "@xmath167 1 km , perhaps the best constraints on the distribution come from the impact crater size distribution on asteroid gaspra .",
    "there , craters from 0.4 km to 1.5 km in diameter ( caused by projectiles perhaps 10 to 20 times smaller ) are distributed as a power - law with a differential size index -3.7@xmath390.5 ( belton et al .",
    "1992 ; note that chapman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) report that _ fresh _ craters on gaspra follow an even steeper distribution , with differential power law index -4.3@xmath390.3 ) .",

    "we take the number of projectiles with radius @xmath169 as    @xmath170    where @xmath96 is expressed in meters .",

    "lines of constant collision time from equation ( [ tauc2 ] ) are plotted in figure ( [ tauc_plot ] ) .",

    ".    disrupted asteroid p/2010 a2 ( interpreted as a @xmath060 m radius object impacted by a projectile of characteristic size 2 to 4 meters ; jewitt et al .",
    "2010 ) is also marked in figure ( [ tauc_plot ] ) , indicating a collision time @xmath175 7 to 50@xmath2310@xmath103 yr . with @xmath176 4@xmath2310@xmath34 ( equation [ n ] ) , the expected rate of similar events is @xmath08 to 60 yr@xmath22 .",
    "jewitt et al .",
    "( 2011 ) estimated the detection probability of p/2010 a2 clones as @xmath1506% , so that of 8 to 60 similar events per year we would currently detect only @xmath00.5 to 4 .",
    "this is still higher than the actual rate of detection , counted as one object in perhaps a decade of efficient , nearly real - time sky monitoring by linear and other survey telescopes .",
    "the high rate could simply indicate the extreme uncertainty in using equation ( [ n ] ) to estimate the number of meter - sized projectiles .",
    "for example , the equation gives @xmath177 = 3@xmath2310@xmath178 , while published estimates of this number range from @xmath010@xmath179 to @xmath010@xmath180 ( davis et al .",
    "2002 ) , indicating a large uncertainty in @xmath181 at small projectile sizes . or it could indicate that activity in p/2010 a2 is caused by another process , possibly yorp spin - up , as remarked in section ( [ p2010a2 ] ) .",
    "further progress in understanding the impact rate in the asteroid belt hinges strongly upon better measurements of the sub - kilometer size distribution .",
    "future wide - area sky surveys may help elucidate the mechanisms operating to cause asteroidal mass loss .",
    "for example , we expect the spatial distribution of collisionally produced or triggered objects to be correlated with the regions of the asteroid belt in which the collision probability per unit time is highest . unfortunately , the published surveys for active asteroids so far are either biased ( hsieh 2009 ) or , if unbiased , detected no objects and so provide insufficient information ( gilbert and wiegert 2009 , 2010 , sonnett et al .",
    "all but one of the known active asteroids were discovered serendipitously by a variety of surveys and methods , most too poorly quantified in terms of reported areal coverage and limiting magnitude to be used to interpret the spatial distribution .",
    "this dismal situation deserves to be soon corrected by well - characterized , all - sky surveys having sensitivity sufficient to discover substantial numbers of active asteroids .",
    "the number of mechanisms capable of producing mass loss from asteroids rivals the number of asteroids showing evidence for mass loss .",
    "no single mechanism can account for the varied examples of activity observed , but preferred explanations can be suggested for particular objects .    1 .   sublimation of crystalline ice is effective to the outer edge of the asteroid belt and in asteroids up to a few 100 km in size .",
    "observational evidence for the sublimation of water ice is strongest in the two repeatedly active objects 133p / elst - pizarro and 238p / read . 2 .",
    "activity in ( 596 ) scheila is unambiguously caused by the impact of a decameter - sized projectile , as indicated by the photometric and morphological evolution of this body .",
    "rotational instability is likewise broadly operable , but it is the sub - kilometer asteroids that are most likely to be driven towards instability by yorp effects .",
    "the 120 m diameter p/2010 a2 , if it is not also an impact relic , could be a rotationally disrupted body .",
    "4 .   thermal fracture and dehydration cracking are expected to supply dust particles only on asteroids that are very close to the sun ( @xmath1821 au ) and smaller than about 20 km .",
    "radiation pressure sweeping can remove grains from 10 km asteroids up to 3 au , but is more effective at smaller distances .",
    "all these processes may operate in small perihelion object ( 3200 ) phaethon .",
    "ejection of optically active grains ( i.e.  @xmath160 0.1 @xmath38 m ) by the electrostatic mechanism is possible for asteroids up to about 10 - 20 km in radius with an efficiency that is independent heliocentric distance .",
    "no clear examples of this process have been identified .",
