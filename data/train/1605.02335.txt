    "the interaction of the quantum vacuum electromagnetic fields and electrically neutral and polarizable macroscopic bodies with rapidly changing geometry , often referred to as the dynamical casimir effect @xcite , has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite . in particular , for bodies in relative translational motion this interaction is at the origin of the `` quantum friction '' effect which was predicted to occur when two closely spaced perfectly smooth parallel surfaces are sheared past one another @xcite .",
    "the rigorous physical description of this effect , and in particular its existence at zero temperature has been the subject of a continued debate @xcite .",
    "recently , an important advancement in the physical understanding of this effect was reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it was proven that the quantum friction force emerges even at zero temperature and for lossless dielectric materials in shear motion with a relative velocity exceeding twice the cherenkov threshold .",
    "related ideas have been developed in parallel using different approaches @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was highlighted that in some scenarios the quantum friction effect has a classical analog and may be determined by optomechanical interactions that create electromagnetic wave instabilities @xcite .",
    "the instabilities ",
    "i.e. , the natural modes of the system with amplitude growing with time  are developed because of the coupling between the guided modes supported by each surface , and result from the conversion of kinetic energy into electromagnetic energy , which is the physical origin of the friction force .",
    "the conditions required for the emergence of the instabilities in planar geometries were studied in detail in refs . @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the unstable time evolution of the electromagnetic field is anchored in a spontaneous parity - time symmetry breaking of the system and in a phase transition wherein the eigenmodes spectrum becomes complex valued @xcite .",
    "interestingly , related instabilities  known as kelvin - helmholtz instabilities  may arise when the relative velocity of two fluids in contact ( e.g. , the wind blowing over water ) exceeds a certain threshold @xcite .",
    "moreover , kelvin - helmholtz - type instabilities are well known in plasma physics and develop in relativistic shear flows of collisionless plasmas in contact due to the coupling between electron plasma waves mediated by the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "such instabilities are believed to play an important role in astrophysical scenarios , for example at the interfaces between astrophysical jets and the interstellar medium .",
    "recently , it was shown that kelvin - helmholtz - type instabilities can develop as well when there is a vacuum gap in between the sheared plasmas , and this finding was numerically verified with multidimensional particle - in - cell simulations @xcite .    here , we extend the study of electromagnetic instabilities to material bodies under rotation . the possibility of wave amplification by a rotating body was first suggested in the pioneering work of zeldovich @xcite .",
    "more recently , the spontaneous emission of light by a single rotating object was studied with the help of the fluctuation dissipation theorem in the framework of quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "similar to the results of zeldovich , it was shown that light is emitted only for certain specific modes of oscillation and is associated with a friction - type torque .",
    "the interactions between a rotating object with a flat metallic surface were investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it was found that the quantum friction force can be strongly enhanced due to excitation of surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) .",
    "contrary to these previous works , the analysis of the present article relies on simple classical electrodynamics .",
    "in particular , it is highlighted that similar to the case of two bodies in shear translational motion @xcite , the emergence of a friction - type force for a rotational motion is deeply rooted in the development of classical kelvin - helmholtz - type instabilities that lead to the spontaneous conversion of kinetic energy into electromagnetic energy .",
    "to illustrate the ideas , we consider a simple canonical geometry that corresponds to a vacuum cavity delimited by two cylindrical metallic walls under rotational motion . using non - relativistic classical electrodynamics , we determine the natural oscillation frequencies of the cavity and find in which circumstances the moving walls start to spontaneously emit light .",
    "it is shown that an unstable behavior is always accompanied by the emergence of friction - type mechanical torque that acts to oppose the relative motion and to stop the instability .",
    "finally , we study how the relative motion of the walls affects the light propagation in the cavity , and show that under some conditions it is possible to have a strongly unidirectional and nonreciprocal light flow .",
    "the system under study is a two - dimensional vacuum cavity with thickness @xmath0 surrounded by two metallic cylindrical walls rotating with angular velocities @xmath1 , @xmath2 with respect to the @xmath3 axis , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : system_under_study ] ( a ) .",
    "the system is invariant to translations along the @xmath3-direction .",
    "the metals response is assumed to be determined by the drude dispersion model .     and @xmath2 .",
    "( b ) schematic representing the invariance of the system under @xmath4-symmetry . a generic `` element '' of the rotating body ( delimited by the framed box in the bottom region )",
    "is transformed under the time reversal operation as @xmath5 , under parity operation as @xmath6 and under the parity - time operation as @xmath7 . here",
    ", the parity operator is taken equal to @xmath8 . from an electromagnetic point of view",
    ", the parity - time transformation leads to a structure that has the same response as the original one . ]",
    "the angular velocities of the cylinders are supposed to be time independent .",
    "as discussed in the following , strictly speaking this condition may require the application of an external force to counterbalance a friction - type torque due to possible optical instabilities .",
    "in practice , if the metallic walls are sufficiently massive the effect of the friction torque is expected to be negligible in the time scale determined by the growth rate of the electromagnetic fields .",
    "next , we characterize the cavity s natural modes with complex oscillation frequencies @xmath9 . to do so , we use a purely classical approach to expand the electromagnetic fields in the different cavity regions in cylindrical harmonics and derive the characteristic equation by matching the tangential fields at the interfaces",
    ".    it is important to note that different from the case of a body in uniform translational motion @xcite , a body in uniform circular motion is subject to a centripetal acceleration .",
    "unfortunately there is no simple description of the electromagnetic response of a macroscopic medium in accelerated motion .",
    "it is well known that an isotropic uniform ( i.e. , invariant to translations along the direction of motion ) dielectric medium moving with constant velocity @xmath10 with respect to some inertial frame ( the lab frame ) is seen as a bianisotropic medium in this reference frame . indeed , using a relativistic transformation of the fields it is possible to prove that in the lab frame the electromagnetic fields are linked as @xmath11 with the constitutive parameters given by @xcite    @xmath12    being @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 the material parameters in the rest ( comoving ) frame .",
    "equations - are a direct consequence of formula ( 76.9 ) of ref.@xcite and their detailed derivation can be found in ref.@xcite . when the medium is dispersive the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 , etc ,",
    "must be evaluated at the doppler shifted frequency @xcite .",
    "it is relevant to highlight that the material parameters - ensure that the plane wave natural modes seen in the lab frame have a dispersion that differs from that seen in the co - moving frame simply by a relativistic doppler shift transformation .",
    "unfortunately , formulas - are difficult to generalize to the case of rotating bodies , mainly because there is no inertial frame wherein a rotating body is instantaneously at rest .",
    "these features greatly complicate the exact physical characterization of the wave phenomena in the cylindrical cavity .",
    "thus , for the sake of simplicity , we will suppose that to a first approximation the transformed constitutive parameters - are locally valid at each point of the moving medium .",
    "moreover , we restrict our attention to the quasi - electrostatic limit and to velocities @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the radial distance to the center of the cavity ) small with respect to the light velocity @xmath21 , so that the bianisotropic nature of the transformed constitutive parameters can be neglected",
    ". note that in the quasi - static limit the electric field dominates over the magnetic field and this justifies the neglect of the crossed material parameters ( @xmath22 ) . within these assumptions , equations - reduce to @xmath23",
    ", @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and the influence of the rotational motion dwells only in the doppler shifted frequency @xmath26 : @xmath27 here , @xmath26 represents the frequency in the frame instantaneously comoving with the relevant point of the @xmath28-th material with velocity @xmath29 . in case of a translational motion along the @xmath30-direction",
    ", it can be related to the frequency @xmath31 in the laboratory frame as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the wave number along the @xmath30 direction . for a rotational motion @xmath34 ,",
    "and thus it follows that @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the derivative with respect to the azimuthal angle .",
    "the dependence of the constitutive parameters on a spatial derivative ( @xmath37 ) is consistent with the fact that a frequency dispersive medium in motion becomes spatially dispersive . for waves with an azimuthal variation of the form",
    "@xmath38 the doppler shifted frequency is given simply by : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the azimuthal quantum number . in summary , in the quasi - static limit and under a non - relativistic approximation a dielectric under a rotational motion is characterized in the lab frame by the same material parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 as in the rest frame , but @xmath41 and @xmath42 need to be evaluated at the doppler shifted frequency @xmath43 .",
    "in all the examples of the article the materials do not have a magnetic response ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "we numerically verified ( not shown ) that this theory applied to the case of metal slabs in relative translational motion gives results consistent with the exact relativistic solution .    using the proposed formalism it is now a simple task to find the cavity modes .",
    "it is clear that because of the cylindrical symmetry the modes can be classified according to the azimuthal variation @xmath45 . here , we are interested in @xmath46-polarized modes with electric field parallel to the @xmath47 plane and magnetic field directed along the @xmath3-symmetry axis .",
    "an ansatz for the magnetic field in the lab frame is @xmath48 with @xmath49 a cylindrical bessel function of the first kind ( @xmath50 ) or of the second kind ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "hence , taking into account the specific asymptotic conditions to be satisfied in each part of the cavity , the magnetic field in each region of space of fig .",
    "[ fig : system_under_study ] is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the hankel function of the first kind , and @xmath54 are constant coefficients .",
    "the permittivity of each region @xmath41 is evaluated at the corresponding doppler shifted frequency @xmath43 .",
    "the azimuthal component of the electric field in the @xmath28-th region is given by @xmath55 by imposing the continuity of @xmath56 and @xmath57 at the two material - vacuum interfaces , one obtains the following 4 @xmath58 4 homogeneous matricial system ( here @xmath59 represents the derivative with respect to the argument ) @xmath60 whose nontrivial solutions determine the cavity modes .",
    "the natural frequencies of oscillation @xmath61 can be found by setting the determinant of the matrix equal to zero . because the bessel functions lead to a transcendental characteristic equation , the calculation of the natural frequencies",
    "can only be done with numerical methods .",
    "consistent with the assumptions that led to eq . , we are interested in subwavelength metallic cavities for which @xmath62 .",
    "as shown next , in this case it is possible to greatly simplify the problem and obtain an approximate algebraic characteristic equation .",
    "indeed when @xmath62 the asymptotic form of the cylindrical bessel functions can be used    @xmath63    where @xmath64 are constant coefficients and it is assumed that @xmath65 .",
    "the case @xmath66 is not interesting to us because waves with a zero azimuthal quantum number do not experience a doppler shift ( @xmath67 see eq . ) , and hence it is evident that for @xmath66 there are no instabilities . in this context , the homogeneous matricial system can be rewritten as @xmath68 where @xmath69 are some constant coefficients .",

    "the natural oscillation frequencies @xmath61 only depend on the ratio between the radii but not on the specific values of the individual radii .",
    "the impact of a finite cavity radius can be investigated by directly solving equation .",
    "it is important to highlight that eq .",
    "is nothing more than  apart from the doppler - shifted frequencies in the material parameters  the dispersion of the cavity modes in the quasi - static limit .",
    "this observation makes clear that our analysis can be extended in a straightforward manner to other geometries . in the rest of the article",

    "we use the algebraic characteristic equation to characterize the cavity natural frequencies .",

    "as seen , for angular velocities greater than a threshold velocity approximately coincident with the plasma frequency of the metal @xmath73 , two of the eigenwaves have complex oscillation frequencies .",
    "in particular , one of the modes has @xmath80 with a positive imaginary part corresponding to waves growing with time as @xmath81 , i.e. to an unstable system .     for @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",

    "[ fig : system_under_study ] ( b ) , the time - reversal operator flips the velocity of the medium @xcite , while the parity operator flips the @xmath90-component of the velocity , and hence the combined @xmath87 operation only flips the @xmath30-component of the velocity , as it should be so that the medium stays invariant under a coordinate transformation of the form @xmath91 .",
    "thus , for a lossless system the emergence of system instabilities is a manifestation of a broken @xmath86-symmetry similar to the planar case studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and implies that the time evolution of electromagnetic waves is described by a non - hermitian @xmath86-symmetric operator .",

    "the peak value of @xmath80 occurs roughly for @xmath97 , being @xmath98 the surface plasmon resonance .",

    "the field has a dipolar symmetry ( @xmath77 ) and the regions of strongest field intensity are concentrated close to the surface of each cylinder , facing each other .",
    "this observation together with the fact that the instabilities are developed for @xmath103 demonstrates that the field exponential growth with time is due to the interaction of surface plasmon polaritons in each cylinder , similar to what happens in the planar case @xcite .",
    "the field exponential growth can be pictured as being due to the interaction of positive frequency harmonic oscillators and negative frequency harmonic oscillators , such that @xmath104 and @xmath105 have opposite signs @xcite .",
    "this interaction is made possible by the relative rotation of the two cylinders .",
    "oscillators associated with negative frequencies behave as energy reservoirs that may serve to pump the oscillations of the system and generate the unstable behavior @xcite . for example , when @xmath99 it can be checked that @xmath106 and @xmath107 in the entire instability region , and thus the moving region may be regarded as the energy reservoir . in addition , the plasmonic nature of the interaction can be seen by noting that the peak instability occurs for @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "it is instructive to note that for a translational motion an unstable behavior requires the coupling of two oscillators ( interaction of two different bodies in relative motion ) because with a single moving body it is always possible to switch to a frame where the body is at rest , and where evidently instabilities are impossible to occur @xcite . in principle , for a rotational motion the instabilities may occur even with a single body because a rotating body is in motion in _ any _ inertial frame .",
    "however , if the velocity of rotation is sufficiently small , as implicit in our theory , the interaction between different parts of the same body is ineffective , and similar to the case of a translational motion two interacting bodies ( two different oscillators ) are required to trigger the instability . indeed , for a single rotating cylinder surrounded by a vacuum ( the limit @xmath110 and @xmath71 ) eq .",

    "stronger instabilities are obtained for a smaller gap .",
    "remarkably , the threshold angular velocity for the unstable behavior scales roughly as @xmath119 and hence decreases with the azimuthal quantum number .",

    "is at rest ( e.g. , @xmath99 ) the peak instability is always associated with the frequency @xmath101 , independent of the value of @xmath117 .    due to the reality of the electromagnetic field , the spectrum associated with negative values of @xmath117 is linked to the spectrum associated with positive values of @xmath117 as @xmath121 , such that the real part of the frequency is flipped , while the imaginary part is unchanged . in the case",
    "wherein @xmath99 , the unstable modes with @xmath122 occur for azimuthal quantum numbers @xmath117 with the same sign as @xmath1 .",
    "an intuitive explanation is that the spontaneous light emission by a rotating body favors physical channels associated with angular variations in the direction determined by the moving body .",
    "it is important to have some idea of the impact of time retardation effects .",

    "the effect of time retardation is to reduce the strength of the instabilities .",
    "the threshold for the emergence of instabilities is unaffected by the time retardation .          from the poynting theorem in the time domain , it is simple to show that for a closed cavity and in the absence of external current sources the quantity @xmath124 must be time independent . it is implicitly assumed that the angular velocity of the rotating bodies is time - invariant . for lossless materials @xmath125 can be identified with the total wave energy of the system , which includes the electromagnetic energy and part of the energy associated with the kinetic degrees of freedom of the system ( see ref.@xcite for a detailed discussion ) . for time - harmonic fields @xmath126 , @xmath127 , etc , it is straightforward to check that @xmath128 where @xmath129 is a periodic function of time with period @xmath130 .",

    "these findings are completely consistent with the results of refs.@xcite , where it was shown that the wave energy density has no lower bound in a material that moves with a velocity that exceeds the cherenkov limit .",
    "this theory provides an intuitive explanation of the reason why the instabilities are associated with two oscillators with oppositely signed frequencies . indeed , in case of an unstable behavior ( growing exponential ) the total wave energy of the system can be time - independent only if @xmath143",

    "note that even though the total wave energy is time independent , the wave energy density varies with time and in space due to the energy transfer between the two bodies under rotation .",
    "an obvious question is : what is the mechanism that pumps the unstable modes ? is it rooted , similarly to the planar case @xcite , in the conversion of kinetic energy into electromagnetic energy ?",
    "next , it is confirmed that this is indeed the case , and to demonstrate such a property we determine the mechanical torque induced by the instabilities .",
    "the instantaneous force per unit of volume induced by the electromagnetic field is @xcite @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the electromagnetic momentum density and @xmath146 the maxwell stress tensor .",

    "[ fig : natural_modes_vs_velocity ] and [ fig : torque ] , it is seen that the torque is intimately linked to these instabilities since it is non zero only for the angular velocities for which the system is unstable .",

    "this property raises interesting possibilities in the context of asymmetric light flows , which are otherwise generally forbidden in conventional reciprocal media ( e.g. , isotropic dielectrics and metals at rest ) @xcite .",
    "an intuitive picture of the effect of motion is that the phase velocity depends if the wave propagates downstream or upstream with respect to the flow of matter @xcite .",
    "as discussed next , this feature can be explored to design a light `` circulator '' .",
    "a circulator is a nonreciprocal three - port network , that is ubiquitous in microwave technology @xcite .",
    "circulators are also useful at optical frequencies for optical switching and for the optical isolation of the light source from the optical channel .",
    "a circulator ideally only allows transmission from port 1 to 3 or from port 3 to 2 or from port 2 to 1 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : modes_optical_circulator ] ; in the figure it is implicit that optical waveguides are connected to the cylindrical cavity at the relevant ports ) .",
    "the propagation in the opposite azimuthal direction ( e.g. , from port 1 to port 2 ) is forbidden .    , @xmath164 , @xmath99 and @xmath174 .",
    "]    in conventional circulators , the unidirectional light flow relies on the existence of constructive or destructive interference patterns at each output , arising from the different oscillation frequency of the modes circulating in the clockwise or anti - clockwise directions in the cavity .",
    "usually the mode splitting is achieved due to a zeeman - type effect when magnetic materials ( e.g. , ferrites and some garnets @xcite ) are biased by a static magnetic field .",
    "because of the drawbacks in terms of size and weight of permanent magnets , different approaches free of magnetic elements have been recently proposed @xcite .    in what follows , we theoretically demonstrate a new paradigm for an optical circulator based on a cavity with rotating walls .",
    "a related result was recently reported for the acoustic case @xcite . remarkably , this effect is neither based on wave instabilities in the cavity nor on the excitation of spps in each slab , but rather on the modal asymmetry between the waves propagating in the direction of rotation ( @xmath175 ) and in the counter propagating direction ( @xmath176 ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , it can be shown using equation that at small velocities ( @xmath177 ) one of the resonant frequencies of the cavity is approximately given by @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the resonant frequency of the cavity when the walls are at rest .",
    "then it follows that the natural frequency of oscillation for the modes associated with @xmath180 linearly split as @xmath181 this behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : modes_optical_circulator ] where the evolution of the natural frequencies with the normalized angular velocity is represented for a resonator with @xmath78 , @xmath164 , @xmath99 and @xmath174 .",
    "as seen , the motion of the inner cylinder induces a splitting of the modes , linear in @xmath75 at small angular velocities , and somewhat analogous to the zeeman splitting obtained with magnetic materials .",
    "the splitting can be understood noting that the resonance condition is roughly of the form @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is the mean perimeter of the cavity and @xmath184 is the spp phase velocity in the cavity , which depends on the azimuthal quantum number . because of the fresnel drag one may expect that when @xmath185 the velocity @xmath184 is larger for modes associated with positive @xmath117 as compared to a mode with index @xmath186 .",
    "thus , this indicates that @xmath187 , consistent with the analytical model .    when the circulator is excited in port 1 , the transmissivities for ports 2 and 3 depend on the frequencies of the cavity modes as follows ( the formula below corrects a typo in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xcite    @xmath188    where @xmath189 and @xmath190 are the real and imaginary parts of the natural mode frequencies @xmath191 associated with @xmath192 . using the approximate expression for @xmath191",
    ", we find that for @xmath193 and @xmath194 one has @xmath195 and @xmath196 and thus the system behaves as an ideal circulator .",
    "remarkably , the energy flow in the circulator is towards the direction opposite to that of the motion the inner cylinder .    to confirm this result ,",
    "a density plot of the transmissivities is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmission_density_optical_circulator ] as a function of the normalized frequency and of the normalized angular velocity , for the same structural parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig : modes_optical_circulator ] .     and @xmath197 as a function of the normalized frequency @xmath31 and of the normalized angular velocity @xmath75 . here , @xmath198 is the resonance frequency when the walls are at rest .",
    "the cavity has the same structural parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig : modes_optical_circulator ] . brighter ( darker ) colours represent a stronger ( weaker ) transmission . ]",
    "as seen in the figure , there is a region near to @xmath199 and @xmath200 where simultaneously @xmath201 goes to zero and @xmath197 goes to 1 . in this regime ,",
    "the moving cavity is strongly non - reciprocal and behaves as an ideal circulator .",
    "the corresponding transmission curves for an angular velocity close to the optimal angular velocity @xmath202 are represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmission_optical_circulator ] as a function of frequency .     and @xmath197 as a function of the normalized frequency for the optimal angular velocity @xmath203 and a plasma collision frequency @xmath174 .",
    "the structural parameters of the cavity are the same as in figs .",
    "[ fig : modes_optical_circulator ] and [ fig : transmission_density_optical_circulator ] . ]",
    "interestingly , the optimal angular velocity depends only on the level of loss in the plasmonic material , and is smaller for resonances with high quality factor . in an optical design relying on plasmonic materials , in the best scenario it can be about three orders of magnitude smaller than the plasma frequency .",
    "thus , typically the angular velocity required for the cavity to operate as an optical circulator lies well below the threshold associated with electromagnetic instabilities .",
    "this puts into evidence that the regime wherein the wave has strongly asymmetric azimuthal flows is independent of the regime wherein the instabilities are developed .",
    "it is important to discuss the practical feasibility of the light generator / amplifier or optical circulator studied in the previous sections .",
    "remarkably , the angular velocities required to obtain optical instabilities are comparable to the metal plasma frequency , and in the best case scenario are about three orders of magnitude smaller for an optical circulator . to our best knowledge , the highest angular velocities ever reached experimentally are reported in @xcite , where a circularly polarized laser impinging on a birefringent particle produces an angular velocity of the order of the @xmath204 .",
    "this value is far from reaching the plasma frequencies of metals that typically are in the uv range @xcite , or the plasma frequency of semiconductors such as insb that are in the   range @xcite .",
    "consequently , a direct laboratory verification of the concepts proposed in this paper appears unfeasible with the available technology .",
    "yet , there may be a way to overcome these difficulties .",
    "indeed , we envision that the physical motion of neutral bodies can be mimicked by an electron drift ( electrons flowing on a positive ion background ) induced by a dc generator .",
    "a preliminary assessment of this idea was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was demonstrated that the physics of the two systems is rather similar in the planar case .",
    "the emergence of electromagnetic instabilities due to an electron drift was also discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where instabilities were found at   frequencies due to the interaction of drifting electrons with lattice waves within the same high mobility semiconductor . the analogies between the two platforms may offer a viable alternative to the actual motion of neutral matter and may allow for the experimental verification of the effects discussed in this article .",
    "these ideas will be investigated in future work .    in summary",
    ", we studied the conditions under which a pair of plasmonic cylinders rotating past one another develop wave instabilities due to the hybridization of the surface plasmon polaritons supported by the individual cylinders .",
    "the characteristic equation for the system natural modes was found , and it was shown that for certain cylindrical harmonics , when the angular velocity surpasses a threshold value comparable to the plasma frequency , some natural modes may have a positive imaginary part corresponding to a wave amplitude growing with time .",
    "the instabilities were shown to be robust with respect to realistic material losses . by computing the mechanical torque acting on the cylinders , it was demonstrated that analogous to the planar case , the wave amplification corresponds to a conversion of kinetic energy into electromagnetic radiation and is observed as long as the velocity of rotation is kept above the threshold .",
    "we also investigated the possibility of having a strongly asymmetric light transmission relying on the rotation of the cavity walls .",
    "it was shown that the motion of the walls induces a frequency split of the cavity modes that results in a strong nonreciprocal behavior that can serve to design an optical circulator .",
    "the optimal angular frequency of rotation is determined by the quality factor of the cavity .",
    "cavities with larger quality factors require lower angular velocities , and hence are the most interesting platform to demonstrate our designs .",
    "finally , we suggested that the behavior of the moving walls may be mimicked by an electron drift induced by a dc voltage generator .",
    "this concept can provide a practical roadmap to verify and explore the proposed ideas at terahertz frequencies .",
