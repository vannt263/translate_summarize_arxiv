    "optical experiments on quantum dot molecules ( qdms ) @xcite have shown that qdms differ in many ways from single quantum dots ( qds ) . in a recent work @xcite",
    "we have discussed the effects of collective interaction between closely spaced dots and the modes of electromagnetic field ( sub- and superradiance @xcite ) , as manifested in the luminescence decay from a single qdm . here",
    "we will consider the nonlinear four - wave mixing ( fwm ) response from an ensemble of qdms @xcite .",
    "the fwm spectroscopy is a powerful tool for extracting information on lifetimes and homogeneous dephasing from inhomogeneous ensembles @xcite . in the case of markovian decoherence ,",
    "the interpretation of the measured fwm signal is straightforward @xcite .",
    "more care must be taken for non - markovian pure dephasing , where the fwm response does not reproduce the optical response of a single system @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , the time evolution of the fwm signal from qdms is much more complicated than that from qds and carries information on the interaction between the dots and on the correlations of their size .",
    "therefore , before one can proceed to the discussion of decoherence effects , it is necessary to analyze all the factors that affect the shape of the fwm response .",
    "this is the goal of the present paper .",
    "we will study the shape of the fwm signal for a pair of qds and its dependence on the size distribution and size correlations between the dots , as well as on the interaction between them , in absence of any decoherence .",
    "each qdm will be modelled as a four - level system with the basis states @xmath0 , corresponding to the ground state ( empty dots ) , an exciton in the second and first qd , and excitons in both qds , respectively .",
    "a fwm experiment consists in exciting an ensemble of qdms with two ultrashort laser pulses , arriving at @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the pulses are spectrally very broad to assure resonance with all the qds in the ensemble .",
    "first , consider a single qdm composed of two qds with energies @xmath3 .",
    "we will describe its evolution in a frame rotating with the frequency @xmath4 .",
    "then , in the rotating wave approximation , the hamiltonian for this single qdm is @xmath5,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the amplitude envelopes and phases of the pulses , respectively , @xmath8 is the coupling between the dots ( tunnel or frster ) , @xmath9 is the unit operator and the tensor product decomposition refers to the two qds making up the molecule .",
    "the pulses do not overlap in time .",
    "if the durations of the pulses are much shorter than both @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the action of each of them corresponds to the independent rotation of the state of each qd , that is , to the unitary transformation @xmath12 , where @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath14 is the pulse area . between the pulses and after the second pulse the system evolution is generated by the time - independent hamiltonian given by the first two terms in eq .",

    "the optical polarization of a single qdm under consideration is proportional to @xmath20 . in order to extract the fwm polarization",
    "we pick out the terms containing the phase factor @xmath21 .",
    "the total optical response from the sample is obtained by summing up the contributions from individual qdms with a weight factor @xmath22 reflecting the distribution of transition energies in the sample ( we neglect a possible variation of dipole moments ) . as a result",

    "for the calculations we will use the values for the energy variance @xmath32  mev and for the average energy mismatch @xmath33  mev @xcite . in order to fix the relative amplitudes of the contributions @xmath34 we assume @xmath35 and expand the trigonometric coefficients in eqs .",

    "the obtained result is remarkable for two reasons .",
    "first , the shape of the echo peak for noninteracting dots does not depend on the correlations between the transition energies @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "second , the beats related to the energy mismatch are always in phase with the fwm echo , so that they do not lead to oscillations in the time - integrated signal .",
    "the only trace of these beats are the oscillations in the tails of the echo peak .",
    "third , the amplitude of the echo contains the factor @xmath49 $ ] and becomes small if the qdm is formed by very different dots .",
    "if the qds are coupled , the other three terms contribute to the signal .",
    "this results in a modification of the shape of the echo peak , which now depends on the degree of correlation between the energy parameters of the two dots . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tr ] we show the results obtained by numerical integration . for @xmath50  mev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tr]b , e ) , which is a realistic value of the frster coupling for @xmath51  nm distance between the dots , the shape is only slightly modified .",
    "a much larger effect is observed for stronger coupling ( as might result from tunneling ) . for the parameters chosen here ,",
    "the characteristic sharp feature appearing at the top of the response peak for strong couplings is considerably smeared out by the 100 fs reference pulse ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tr]c , f ) .",
    "nevertheless , the evolution of the echo shape with growing coupling remains clear .",
    "( 70,30)(0,5 ) ( 0,0 )    as mentioned above , in the limit of vanishing interaction there are no beats in the time - integrated fwm signal as a function of the delay @xmath52 .",
    "this changes for @xmath53 due to the contribution from the term @xmath54 and second part of @xmath55 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ti ] ) . at the center of the echo peak , @xmath56 ,",
    "these terms have the variable phase factors @xmath57 and @xmath58 . as a result",
    ", they lead to oscillations of the integrated fwm signal as a function of @xmath52 but only as long as @xmath59 . for longer times these terms do not contribute because of the phase averaging due to inhomogeneous distribution of energy differences @xmath29 .",
    "such oscillations of the time - integrated signal might be a useful signature of interaction between the qds .",
    "unfortunately , for the system parameters used here they are present only for @xmath60  ps and will be covered by phonon - related features @xcite .",
    "our results show that the shape of the time - resolved fwm signal may provide some clue on the properties of the qdms in the ensemble , including coupling and , for coupled dots , size correlations between the qds .",
    "we have studied only the amplitude of the fwm response . it should be noted , however , that the terms @xmath61 and @xmath62 are real , while the other two are purely imaginary .",
    "therefore , much more information is contained in the phase properties of the signal .",
    "moreover , nonlinear experiments can be performed beyond the perturbative regime @xcite .",
    "this might allow one to selectively investigate selected contributions to the fwm signal by exploiting their different dependence on the pulse areas @xmath63 ."
