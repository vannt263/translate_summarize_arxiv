    "even if the advance of periastron is not resolved in the timing observation , the constraints on the ( observed ) eccentricity vector can be converted into a limit on @xmath0 . from the 10 years of timing and the optical observations of psr  j1738 + 0333 ( antoniadis  2012 , freire  2012 ) one obtains the most constraining limit , @xmath12 which is significantly better than the current best limits from both weak field ( mller  2008 ) and strong field ( wex 2000 ) .",
