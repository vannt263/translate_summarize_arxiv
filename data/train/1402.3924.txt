    "the casimir effect , as one of the most direct manifestations of the existence of vacuum oscillations , after the development for more than 60 years , is still an active research area attracting increasing interest in both fundamental and applied science .",
    "there are many articles and books that can give a comprehensive review towards this effect@xcite .",
    "the influence of temperature on the casimir effect is a topic which should be paid attention to since the typical quantum state is a state containing particles in thermal equilibrium and actually all experimental measurements of the casimir effect have been done at room temperature .",
    "in fact , the topic has indeed attracted a lot of interest . in the work of lifshitz and collaborators ,",
    "@xcite who generalized casimir s result to the case of parallel dielectrics , they considered temperature corrections . and the further study were done by sauer , @xcite mehra@xcite and brown and maclay@xcite .",
    "some years later , the more complete theory was given by schwinger et .",
    "al . @xcite . in recent years , the interest in the study on temperature dependence of the casimir effect is increasing .",
    "the finite temperature casimir effect in the presence of extra dimensions@xcite is one of the topics .",
    "some controversies were discussed ( see ref . @xcite and references therein . ) .",
    "the progress is exciting in that there is a possibility to measure the thermal effect in the casimir force @xcite .    in the study of the casimir effect ,",
    "the key step is to regularize the sum of infinite series to extract the physical finite quantity .",
    "the frequently used regularization methods , such as the green s function method , the abel - plana formula and the zeta function technique , developed for calculation of the relevant casimir energy at zero temperature , can be generalized straightforwardly to the finite temperature case@xcite . with these regularization methods , the casimir energy at finite temperature has been calculated for various fields and different geometries in more than four dimensional spacetime@xcite .",
    "the earliest work about the casimir effect at finite temperature for a @xmath0-dimensional rectangular cavity inside a @xmath2-dimensional space was done by ambjrn and wolfram@xcite . recently",
    "lim and teo @xcite reconsidered this topic in detail , giving the results of different boundary conditions and the low temperature and high temperature expansions .",
    "later , geyer et .",
    "al gave a critical discussion on the thermal casimir effect in ideal metal rectangular boxes in three - dimensional space @xcite where they obtained the finite expression for the casimir free energy by making use of the zeta function technique .",
    "they pointed out a problem existed in some previous papers that the subtraction of the contribution of the black body radiation and other geometrical contributions of quantum origin were neglected , which led to the contradiction with the classical limit in high temperature regime .",
    "for the finite temperature casimir effect between the simplest configuration  two parallel perfectly conducting plates in three - dimensional space , from which the rectangular boxes extend easily , there is a standard result in literature @xcite which was obtained usually by green s function regularization .",
    "@xcite reproduced the standard result by making use of the zeta function regularization technique . more recently ,",
    "bezerra et .",
    "al.@xcite reconsidered the thermal casimir effect in einstein and closed friedmann universes and emphasized the same procedure as what geyer et .",
    "in the two new works @xcite , teo considered the casimir effect on the boundaries of @xmath2-dimensional cavities and spherical shells and discussed the high temperature asymptotics . in these papers",
    "@xcite , a common recognition was reached that the terms of order equal to or more than the square of the temperature should be subtracted but the reason was not stated clearly .",
    "furthermore , it is not easy to get the explicit expression of these terms from the calculation of the heat kernel coefficients .    in this paper",
    ", we reconsider systematically the thermal casimir effect for massless scalar fields in @xmath0-dimensional rectangular cavity of @xmath1-dimensional minkowski space - time . for simplicity , we take the cavity as a hypercube .",
    "as is known to all , the free energy can be divided into zero temperature part and temperature - dependent part . for a restricted spatial volume ,",
    "the zero temperature part is divergent while the temperature - dependent one is finite .",
    "so , there is no doubt on the regularization of the zero temperature part , but due to the finiteness , there exists some misunderstanding in the literature about the regularization of the temperature - dependent part .",
    "in fact , the casimir free energy should exhibit classical limit at high temperature where the result does not depend on the planck constant @xcite and the casimir force should tend to zero with the separation increasing to infinity .",
    "however , this can only be achieved after the regularization of both parts of the free energy . in this paper",
    ", we give a rigorous prove and derivation of the regularization of the free energy of the @xmath0-dimensional hypercube inside @xmath1-dimensional space - time for all three boundary conditions ( bcs ) of the scalar field .",
    "the regularization of the zero temperature energy can be undoubtedly done using for instance the zeta - function technique .",
    "for the temperature - dependent part , we do the regularization using the abel - plana formula repeatedly and obtain the explicit expression of the terms that should be subtracted from the free energy . in the case of periodic bcs , there is only one term to be subtracted which is corresponding to the black body radiation . in the cases of dirichlet and neumann bcs , the terms to be subtracted are expressed in series form that are proportional to the power of the side length of the hypercube and the temperature .",
    "this result is general that the the results of the cases of parallel plates and three - dimensional box in the literature could be included in .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath3 and @xmath4 cases with periodic , dirichlet and neumann bcs , we give the explicit expressions of the casimir free energy in both low temperature ( small separations ) and high temperature ( large separations ) regimes , through which asymptotic behavior of the casimir free energy changing with temperature and the side length is easily to see .",
    "we also discuss the thermal casimir force changing with temperature and the side length in different cases .",

    "<S> we reconsider the thermal scalar casimir effect for @xmath0-dimensional rectangular cavity inside @xmath1-dimensional minkowski space - time . in dealing with the thermal casimir effect , one can get the free energy consisting of the divergent zero - temperature part and the finite temperature - dependent part after some standard treatment of the finite temperature quantum field theory . due to the finiteness </S>",
    "<S> , there exists some misunderstanding about the regularization of the temperature - dependent part . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the casimir free energy should exhibit classical limit at high temperature where the result does not depend on the planck constant and the casimir force should tend to zero with the separation increasing to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> these can only be achieved after the regularization for both parts of the free energy . </S>",
    "<S> we derive rigorously the regularization of the temperature - dependent part of the free energy by making use of the abel - plana formula repeatedly and get the explicit expression of the terms to be subtracted . in the cases of @xmath2=3 , @xmath0=1 and @xmath2=3 , @xmath0=3 , we precisely recover the results of parallel plates and three - dimensional box in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for @xmath3 and @xmath4 cases with periodic , dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions , we give the explicit expressions of the casimir free energy in both low temperature ( small separations ) and high temperature ( large separations ) regimes , through which the asymptotic behavior of the free energy changing with temperature and the side length is easy to see . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for @xmath3 , with the side length going to infinity , the casimir free energy tends to positive or negative constants or zero , depending on the boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> but for @xmath4 , the leading term of the casimir free energy for all three boundary conditions is a logarithmic function of the side length . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the thermal casimir force changing with temperature and the side length in different cases and find with the side length going to infinity the force always tends to zero for different boundary conditions regardless of @xmath3 or @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the casimir free energy and force at high temperature limit behave asymptotically alike in that they are proportional to the temperature , be they positive ( repulsive ) or negative ( attractive ) in different cases </S>",
    "<S> . our study may be helpful in providing a comprehensive and complete understanding of this old problem . </S>"
