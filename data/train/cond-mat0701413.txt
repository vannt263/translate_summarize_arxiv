    "quantum many - body systems often exhibit complex behavior , arising from the strong interactions between the individual degrees of freedom . in some cases , the exotic physical properties can be simply explained in terms of suitable renormalized collective excitations .",
    "well - known examples are the charge - spin separation in the luttinger liquid with gapless bosonic excitations , @xcite solitons on a cdw condensate , @xcite and fractional charges in quantum hall systems.@xcite    another system that exhibits emerging complex behavior is the generalized wigner lattice ( gwl ) , defined as the classical charge pattern that minimizes the coulomb repulsion on a discrete lattice .",
    "the gwl was introduced by hubbard@xcite to explain the charge ordering observed in the ttf - tcnq organic salts , and has since been invoked in several classes of narrow - band quasi - one - dimensional compounds.@xcite increasing the electron bandwidth smears the classical charge distribution , and eventually drives the system towards a small amplitude charge density wave.@xcite    however , in the strongly interacting limit , where the bandwidth is much smaller than the electrostatic repulsive energy , the quantum charge distribution remains very close to the classical configuration . in this limit ,",
    "the low - lying excitations are pairs of domain - walls ( kinks and anti - kinks ) , that carry fractional charge.@xcite it follows that the low energy properties of the system can be determined by solving the problem of two interacting domain - walls , which is equivalent to the coulomb problem on a one - dimensional chain . since kinks and anti - kinks have opposite charges , the lowest lying excitations of the gwl will be bound pairs , followed by a continuum of unbound domain - walls . restricting to the subspace with only one kink / anti - kink pair",
    ", the quantum melting of the gwl was estimated in ref.@xcite as the point where the gap in the excitation spectrum vanishes .",
    "the result is in agreement with previous variational estimates @xcite as well as with more recent exact diagonalization data , @xcite indicating that the single pair approximation captures the essential physics of the gwl phase . on the other hand",
    ", it clearly breaks down close to the quantum melting transition , where a proliferation of domain - walls is expected .    in this paper , we take advantage of the exact solution of the discrete coulomb problem given in refs.@xcite to evaluate the optical conductivity of the generalized wigner lattice at simple commensurate fillings @xmath2 .",
    "the formation of excitons manifests through the emergence of a series of sharp peaks , followed by a strongly asymmetric absorption band due to continuum of scattering states .",
    "remarkably , both the discrete peaks and the asymmetry of the absorption continuum are direct consequences of the long - range interactions among the electrons in the original model , that disappear when the coulomb interactions are replaced by short - range potentials .    an analogous formalism is used to calculate the spectral function @xmath1 . however , since the addition or removal of an electron to a gwl at filling @xmath2 is equivalent to the creation of @xmath3 domain - walls,@xcite the single pair approximation only applies to the special case @xmath4 .",
    "the interactions being repulsive , because the domain - walls have equal charge , the low - lying excitations in the spectral function are unbound scattering states , while anti - bound states appear as a set of dispersive quasi - particle peaks above the continuum.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
