    "galaxy - hosting dark matter systems and the galactic stellar systems themselves act collisionlessly over hubble timescales . understanding the evolution of self - gravitating , collisionless systems is a foundational element to the larger picture of galaxy evolution .",
    "much of the advancement in understanding collisionless evolution has come from @xmath0-body simulations that focus on the motions of large numbers of individual mass elements .",

    "* ) .    while @xmath0-body simulations have given the astrophysics community a powerful method for making predictions that can be tested against observations , the modeled evolutions are sufficiently complex that a full physical picture of the evolution remains lacking",
    "effects such as dynamical friction , collisionless relaxation processes , and even numerical artifacts can all play roles of varying importance in these simulations .",
    "astrophysicists now have substantial empirical evidence that collisionless systems in cosmological contexts have `` universal '' equilibrium distributions of mass and velocities , _",
    "e.g. , _  the radial power - law behavior of density divided by velocity dispersion cubed @xcite .",
    "we are interested in gaining a better understanding of the physical origin of these seemingly special distributions .    before beginning to build a physical picture of collisionless evolution ,",
    "let us quickly review some of the ideas that are involved .",
    "thermal equilibrium is the state that systems relax towards when energy can be exchanged between the components of the system .",
    "a system in thermal equilibrium is characterized by a minimum internal energy or , equivalently , a maximum entropy . in a thermodynamic sense",
    ", entropy is linked to the amount of energy transferred as heat , bringing with it a connotation of randomness . in a statistical sense , entropy is simply a redefinition of the accounting of energy states in a system .",
    "relaxation is a generic term for any process that erases the memory of initial conditions in a system .",
    "for example , gases reach the completely relaxed state of thermal equilibrium through collisions .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that non - degenerate collisionless self - gravitating systems with finite mass and energy do not have a state of maximum entropy when one works with the standard distribution function and assumes that the occupation numbers of phase - space volumes is large enough that stirling s approximation applies ( for an alternative view see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this lack of entropy extremum implies that there is no thermal equilibrium state for such systems . and yet",
    ", mechanical equilibrium , a state with no net force at any location , is possible . in stellar interiors , for example",
    ", the lack of thermal equilibrium  evidenced by gradients in temperature and pressure  is required for mechanical equilibrium .",
    "note that the thermal non - equilibrium description refers to the entire star .",
    "it is common to treat the gas in a star as being in local thermodynamic equilibrium , where small regions of the star are modeled as having uniform temperatures . in this work ,",
    "we consciously make a distinction between full thermal equilibrium and stationary ( time - independent ) situations .",
    "an example that clarifies this difference is familiar to those of us nearer the poles . on a cold winter day ,",
    "a house is heated to a temperature that is well above the outside air temperature .",
    "heat flows out of the house , and entropy is generated in a wall during the energy transfer .",
    "as long as the home s heating system runs and the outdoor temperature remains constant , this process will be steady - state , yet it does not represent a thermal equilibrium as the entropy of the home - outside air system continually increases .",
    "dark matter halos and galactic stellar systems are similar to the above , in the sense that they have temperature gradients and are thus thermally non - equilibrium systems , even though they are steady - state and are in mechanical equilibrium .",
    "thermal non - equilibrium systems are common in nature and have been the subject of numerous studies . for certain non - astrophysical , non",
    "- gravitating systems it was found that stationary states , like mechanical equilibrium , coincide with states of extreme entropy production ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in some instances",
    ", it appears that steady - states are reached by minimizing entropy production , while in other cases maximizing entropy production is the requirement .",
    "the most common modern formulation of the principle of maximum entropy production is due to @xcite .",
    "the principle of miminum entropy production @xcite appears to have a smaller range of applicability , but does find uses in physics , chemistry and biology .",
    "the theoretical interpretation , and the relation between the two seemingly contradictory principles is still being worked out ( _ e.g. , _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a further , and more general reason to explore entropy production in self - gravitating systems is because irreversability and entropy production are closely related concepts .",
    "the `` microscopic '' equation of motion of gravity ( and of other microscopic physics ) is time - reversible , while the global evolution of the system is not , in the sense that it has a definite arrow of time . a natural agent that can make the transition from reversability to irreversability in macroscopic systems is the thermodynamic entropy production .",
    "this ability of thermodynamics to pick the arrow of time through non - zero ( positive ) entropy production has been utilized in a cosmological context by @xcite .",
    "these authors propose a scenario where in the early universe some of the energy of the space - time ( gravity ) was transferred to matter .",
    "because matter production is an irreversible , entropy creating process , the evolution of the universe proceeds with an arrow of time .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the consequences of applying the entropy production extremization principle to self - gravitating systems .",
    "we do not prove that such a principle should be applicable here ; we merely explore what this principle implies .",
    "in particular , we want to find what conditions are necessary to extremize entropy production and how those conditions differ from maximizing the total entropy .",
    "we begin with a review of relevant ideas regarding entropy from both a thermodynamic and statistical point of view in section  [ back ] . in ",
    "[ kinetic ] , entropy production equations for the two statistical families we are interested in are then derived . for these cases",
    ", we also develop the specific forms for collisionless relaxation processes required to extremize the entropy production .",
    "we present a discussion of our results and conclude in section  [ discuss ] .",
    "much of what follows is a distilled derivation of the outcome of extemizing entropy production in collisionless systems . as the mathematical details might muddy the overall flow of the paper , we present an executive summary to draw the reader s attention to the main equations and the connections between them .",
    "* we start by developing a continuity equation for entropy density ( @xmath1 ) , which has an entropy production source term @xmath2 ( see equation  [ s6 ] ) . * statistical descriptions of entropy and entropy density",
    "are derived from enumerating states accessible to the system .",
    "entropy density expressions for both maxwell - boltzmann and lynden - bell statistical families may be found in equations  [ mbsdens ] and [ lbsdens ] , respectively .",
    "these expressions depend on the coarse - grained distribution function , @xmath3 . * taking the partial time derivative of @xmath1 in equations  [ mbsdens ] and [ lbsdens ] produces equations  [ mbk1 ] and [ lbk1 ] , respectively .",
    "these diffentiations result in @xmath4 terms , which we replace using the boltzmann equation ( [ boltz ] ) .",
    "this introduces the relaxation function @xmath5 , as shown in equations  [ mbk2 ] and [ lbk2 ] , respectively .",
    "* expressions of the entropy production @xmath2 for both statistical families are identified by comparing terms resulting from equations  [ mbk2 ] and [ lbk2 ] to those in equation  [ s6 ] . *",
    "finally , we set the variation of the @xmath2 expressions equal to zero .",
    "this procedure then yields the @xmath5 functions found in equations  [ mbexts ] and [ lbexts ] , respectively .      following ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) , we argue that there are two ways to change the total entropy of a system ; 1 ) entropy can enter or leave through a flux , or 2 ) entropy may be created within the system .",
    "note that to be in accord with the second law of thermodynamics during the system s evolution , the system s entropy should not decrease .",
    "a straightforward approach to dealing with entropy changes in time is , @xmath6 where the total entropy is , @xmath7 @xmath8 is the flux entropy , and @xmath9 is the created entropy . unless noted otherwise , all integrations are assumed to be over all configuration and/or velocity space .",
    "the value of the flux entropy depends on how much entropy is entering or leaving the system through a bounding surface , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an entropy flux normal to the surface s , @xmath12 is the entropy convected through the surface by mean motions , the minus sign is convention , and the last equality results from the divergence theorem .",
    "the flux @xmath11 is the result of random motions within a system . in as much as random motions can be linked to thermal energy",
    ", one can think of the random flux as being associated with heat .",
    "the subscripts on the integrals simply draw attention to the change in integration range . the entropy creation term is likewise related to a quantity associated with the system , @xmath13 where @xmath2 is the entropy production per unit volume per unit time . substituting equations  [ s2 ] , [ s3 ] , and [ s4 ] into equation  [ s1 ] , @xmath14 as this expression must be true for an arbitrary volume ,",
    "@xmath15 this is a continuity equation for the entropy density .",
    "the source term , @xmath2 , represents the entropy production within any infinitesimal volume of the system .      from a statistical point of view , entropy is simply a measurement of the number of states accessible to a particular system . from the statistical definition of temperature , entropy can be calculated using , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of accessible states and @xmath18  is the boltzmann constant which serves to give entropy the correct thermodynamic units . as a result , counting procedures are key to determining specific realizations of entropy .",
    "@xcite discusses how there are four counting styles that lead to physically relevant situations .",
    "bose - einstein statistics follow from counting states for indistinguishable particles that can co - habitate . when indistinguishable particles are not allowed to share states ,",
    "fermi - dirac statistics emerge .",
    "classical maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) statistics result from counting states available to distinguishable particles that can share states . completing the symmetry , systems where distinguishable particles can not co - occupy states obey what has become known as lynden - bell ( lb ) statistics ( statistics ` iv ' in lynden - bell s original notation ) .",
    "each type of statistics will produce different representations of entropy , but we will focus on mb and lb here , both of which deal with classical distinguishable particles .",
    "we briefly recap the notation used in @xcite before proceeding with our discussion . the usual six - dimensional position - velocity phase - space ( @xmath19,@xmath20 )",
    "is the setting for determining the statistics .",
    "imagine phase - space to be divided into a very large number of nearly infinitesimal volumes @xmath21 called micro - cells .",
    "each micro - cell can either be occupied or unoccupied by one of the @xmath0 phase elements of the system .",
    "these phase elements can be thought of as being represented by the fine - grained distribution function .",
    "this fine - grained distribution function is assumed to have a constant value @xmath22 . at this level , the phase elements can not co - habitate .",
    "if phase - space is also partitioned on a coarser level so that some number of micro - cells @xmath23 occupy a macro - cell , then we can discuss a coarse - grained distribution function .",
    "the volume of a macro - cell is then @xmath24 and the @xmath25th macro - cell contains @xmath26 phase elements .",
    "we assume that while the volume of a macro - cell is much larger than that of a micro - cell , it is still very small compared to the full extent of phase - space occupied by the system .",
    "the number of ways of organizing the @xmath26 elements into the @xmath23 micro - cells without co - habitation is , @xmath27 if the elements were allowed to multiply occupy micro - cells ( as in mb statistics ) this number would be @xmath28 .    to get the total number of accessible states , the possible ways to distribute the @xmath0 phase elements into @xmath26 chunks must also be included .",
    "@xcite derives , @xmath29 in the mb case , the only change is that the factorial ratio in the final product term is replaced by @xmath28 . with equation  [ lbw ] ,",
    "the entropy can now be expressed as , @xmath30 \\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have assumed @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and used stirling s approximation . in a maxwell - boltzmann situation , the familiar entropy expression is , @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "note that @xmath36 reduces to an expression similar to @xmath37 ( except for the constant ) when @xmath38 . in this",
    "dilute , non - degenerate limit , the difference between allowing and denying co - habitation of states becomes irrelevant .",
    "the number of elements occupying a macro - cell @xmath26 is now replaced by a coarse - grained distribution function of position and velocity . the coarse - grained function @xmath3 is a continuous function of @xmath19  and @xmath20  and represents the number of occupied micro - cells within macro - cells , @xmath39 where the integration is taken over all of phase - space .",
    "@xcite goes on to investigate the results of minimizing equation  [ lbs0 ] with the constraints of constant system mass and energy .",
    "the well - know result of this work is that non - degenerate self - gravitating systems do not have a finite mass and energy thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "we will now describe our investigation into the entropy production that occurs in these systems , keeping the assumption that stirling s approximation is accurate .",
    "note that entropy production takes place because we are considering coarse - grained distributions ; in other words , particles are now allowed to occupy states not accessible within the fine - grained world view . at the fine - grained level",
    "the distribution function does not change and there is no change in entropy .",
    "we now proceed to combine the fluid picture of entropy presented in section  [ entropy ] with the statistical picture from section  [ stat ]",
    ". the general procedure will be to find the time rate of change of the statistical versions of entropy and equate terms to those in equation  [ s6 ] . to do this",
    ", we will rely on the boltzmann equation .",
    "note that the coarse - grained distribution function @xmath3 does not obey the collisionless boltzmann equation , rather its evolution is defined by , @xmath40 where @xmath41  is the acceleration and @xmath42 is the velocity space gradient operator ( @xmath43 ) . in standard ,",

    "the descriptions of @xmath2 for the mb and lb statistical families are given in equations  [ mbsprod ] and [ lbsprod ] , respectively .",
    "since we are dealing with collisionless systems exclusively , one might expect these to be zero .",

    "however , we are considering the coarse - grained function .",
    "as a system evolves , the fine - grained distribution function becomes stretched and twisted in phase - space . because the coarse - grained function averages the fine - grained function with nearby empty regions of phase - space , the coarse - grained function changes as the system evolves .",
    "now , recall that entropy represents the number of accessible states . on the level of the fine - grained function",
    ", the number of accessible states stays the same .",
    "however , going from a fine - grained to coarse - grained description implies that there are now regions of phase - space not occupied by the fine - grained function that are accessible to the coarse - grained function .",
    "this implies that there are more microscopic ways of realizing a given macroscopic state , leading to more possible states and larger entropy .",
    "thus , coarse - graining an evolving system results in entropy production even in a collisionless system . in terms of physical processes , the evolution is due to the larger - scale phase - space evolution of the system driven by collisionless relaxation processes , like violent relaxation and phase mixing .",
    "the above argues that entropy production takes places during evolution of collisionless systems .",
    "but our analysis shows that entropy production takes place even during the steady state .",
    "let us start by writing down the expression for the entropy production during the steady - state by combining equations  [ mbsprod ] and [ mbexts ] for the mb case , @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the volume of occupied velocity space .",
    "this is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics since @xmath109 and all other terms are positive .",
    "a similar expression can be found for the lb case , using equations  [ lbsprod ] and [ lbexts ] . since a steady state",
    "is described by an unchanging value of @xmath2 , any non - zero value of @xmath2 persists even when a system has reached mechanical equilibrium .",
    "it is interesting to think of the source of this continued entropy production .",
    "after a system stops evolving on the macroscopic scale , it still continues to evolve on ever decreasing microscopic scales as the fine - grained function continues to stretch and twist almost indefinitely .",
    "the corresponding continual coarse - graining of the ever evolving fine - grained function on smaller and smaller scales , results in constant , non - zero entropy production .",
    "our expression for the boltzmann equation states that the relaxation function , @xmath5 , determines the rate of change of the coarse - grained distribution function , @xmath110 despite the right hand side being non - zero ( given by equations  [ mbexts ] and [ lbexts ] for the mb and lb statistics , respectively ) , the above equation does not contradict the assumption of a stationary state . a stationary , or steady , state is the eulerian viewpoint , _ i.e. , _  @xmath111 , while the boltzmann equation above is a lagrangian viewpoint . @xmath111",
    "does not imply @xmath112 .",
    "in other words , the relaxation function @xmath5 does not determine the explicit time - dependence of @xmath3 , which must be zero for stationary states , but rather describes a flux of occupied cells through phase - space , as do the velocity - driven ( @xmath113 ) and acceleration - driven ( @xmath114 ) flux terms ( c.f .",
    "equation  [ boltz ] ) . in the context of the lagrangian derivative , we can think of @xmath115 simply as a parameter that indicates the location along a particle s or cell s path through phase - space .    in collisional systems , the relaxation function",
    "is called the collision term and is usually dealt with in a fokker - planck approximation scheme . in these systems the particles , through two - body encounters , gradually disperse over the whole available phase - space , and so @xmath116 following any given particle in an evolving system does not stay constant , but generally decreases with time . in a general collisionless system",
    ", this term represents the processes like violent relaxation and phase mixing , on the coarse - grained scale . in a steady - state collisionless system ,",
    "the large scale processes like violent relaxation no longer operate and the only changes happen on microscopic scales . in this context , the left hand side of equation  [ boltzfull ] describes how a particle , or a cell moves through the system ( and @xmath115 is the parameter ) .",
    "therefore it is not unexpected that over some portions of its motion the coarse - grained density around it will be increasing and over others , it will be decreasing .",
    "for the mb case , @xmath117 for @xmath118 , implying that @xmath3 should continually grow .",
    "however , this is impossible as the coarse - grained distribution function is limited to a maximum value @xmath67 .",
    "this contradiction arises as mb statistics are valid only when @xmath68 so that macro - cells are not multiply occupied . on the other hand",
    ", the lb case does not present any contradictions with the boltzmann equation .",
    "@xmath100 is zero when @xmath119 and @xmath120 , and is positive over the vast majority of the intervening range .",
    "this behavior guarantees that when the coarse - grained density reaches its maximum value , the relaxation term disappears and the system behaves collisionlessly even at the coarse - grained level .    to sum up ,",
    "if extremizing entropy production in self - gravitating systems does lead to steady - state configurations , then equation  [ boltzfull ] with the appropriate expressions for @xmath5 ( as given by equations  [ mbexts ] and [ lbexts ] ) describes the steady state of self - gravitating collisionless systems .",
    "the relaxation term @xmath5 describes the continual evolution of the coarse - grained distribution function , which is due to the combimation of the dynamical evolution of the fine - grained df on microscopic scales , and coarse - graining ."
