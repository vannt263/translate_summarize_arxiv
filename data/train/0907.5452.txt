    "constitutive equations in polymer melts or concentrated solutions are mathematical relationships between the stresses and the external flow conditions .",
    "they represent the inherent properties of the polymer system , and should be derived from the knowledge of polymer chain structures , configurations , interactions and polymer dynamics . in practice , a constitutive model is needed to idealize these microscopic characteristics of polymer chains , due to the complex interactions of this many - chain system ( larson , 1988 ) . as polymer melts own some characteristics of universality ,",
    "that is to say , some physical properties of polymer melts are independent on the microscopic chemical structures , we can coarse grain a real polymer chain as a smooth thread connected by segments ( watanabe , 1999 ) . this coarse - grained chain , just like the real chain , has an enormous number of configurations and can be usefully described statistically as gaussian chain or non - gaussian chain .",
    "in fact , the dynamics in our study is the segmental dynamics , which is based on a spatial scale of a chain segment and those chains are only distinguished by their lengths and abilities of extension .",
    "the interactions between chains are intricate .",
    "however , the attractive interactions between segments are tended to screen out by the excluded volume effect in polymer melts or concentrated solutions ( de gennes , 1979 ) , leaving the topological constraints to play a dominant role in such a system at equilibrium .",
    "a basic understanding of chain dynamics is the key - point to develop constitutive equations for melts or concentrated solutions of flexible polymers .",
    "the proposition of the idea of ` reptative ' motion by de gennes ( 1971 ) is a milestone in the development of polymer dynamics of the concentrated system .",
    "in fact , in a flow the long linear polymer chains become oriented and stretched , which generates internal stress as the response to external disturbance .",
    "however , the orientation and stretch of chains will relax in the course of time due to the motion of non - crosslinked polymer chains .",
    "the major mechanisms of relaxation concerned are : reptation ( doi and edwards , 1978a , b , c , 1979 ) , convection of segments along primitive chains ( doi , 1980 ; marrucci , 1986 ) , fluctuations of the contour length ( doi and edwards , 1986 ; pearson and helfand , 1984 ; mead et al . , 1998 ) , reptative constraint release ( marrucci , 1985 ; des cloizeaux , 1988 , 1990 ; leygue et al . , 2005 , 2006a , b ) , and convective constraint release ( ccr ) ( marrucci , 1996 ; ianniruberto and marrucci , 1996 ; milner et al . , 2001 ; graham et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "the first three kinds of relaxation are caused by the motion of the primitive chains , which can happen only at the ends ; while the other two are induced by the motion of surrounding chains , which can occur not only at their ends but also in some other place along the primitive chains .",
    "the optical - stress law guarantees a linear relationship between the stress and the orientational anisotropy of segments for a highly crosslinked rubber system ( treloar , 1975 ) .",
    "the subsequent studies also show its validity for non - crosslinked polymer system ( janeschitz - kriegl , 1975 ) .",
    "the segments in the crosslinked rubber refer to chain portions between two permanently tethered crosslink points .",
    "the orientations of these segments are uniform .",
    "the segments in the non - crosslinked polymer system refer to entanglement segments .",
    "the orientations of these segments are non - uniform , as the segments can move freely . under fast flow",
    "the polymer chains not only become oriented but also significantly stretched .",
    "the contribution from segmental stretch to stress is proportional to the square of stretch ratio for gaussian chains ( doi and edwards , 1986 ) , while this relationship is much more complex for non - gaussian chains . in the original doi and edwards ( de ) model , due to the faster relaxation of segmental stretch",
    ", the chain is assumed to remain its equilibrium length all the time .",
    "the stress contribution comes only from segmental orientation .",
    "de theory predicts a maximum in shear stress @xmath0 with respect to the shear rate , and followed by a sharp decrease asymptotically as @xmath1 , which has not been observed by experiments .",
    "the neglect of segmental stretch results in a monotonic increase in the first normal stress difference in the start - up of a simple shear flow , however , an overshoot appears in experiment . in order to improve this deficiency of the original de model , several `",
    "chain stretch ' models are proposed . in the uniform stretch model , it is assumed a uniform segmental stretch along the chain , such as larson s ` partially convected strand ' model ( 1984 ) and also the one proposed by pearson et al . , ( 1989 ) .",
    "the non - uniform segmental stretch model is proposed by marrucci and grizzuti ( 1988 ) .",
    "the segmental stretch models are called as demg model ( mead and leal , 1995a , b ) .",
    "the extension of chain segments creates some segment ( or saying pseudo _ defect _",
    "( de gennes , 1971 ) ) sources along the chain , which is equivalent to reduce the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the inclusion of chain stretch also changes the feature in the start - up of shearing .",
    "a serious deficiency in all these models is that in the terminal region excessive shear thinning is inevitable due to the lacking of an extra relaxation mechanism to increase the rate of creating new segments , which is equal to the rate of annihilating old segments , or equivalently saying to avoid high orientation of the chain to the direction of flow .",
    "the mead - larson - doi ( mld ) model incorporating ccr to the demg model qualitatively improves the description of the phenomenon of excessive shear thinning and other rheological properties in steady state and transient shearing flow ( mead et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "recently pattamaprom and larson ( 2001 ) proposed a toy mld model by making an extension of the mld model in a simple way and adding reptative constraint release to mld equations .",
    "in all these models , the rate of ccr is evaluated at the tube end , which is a uniform rate of ccr .",
    "ccr represents the ability of the flow to convect or release entanglements , and is determined by segmental orientation and stretch . as the segmental orientation and stretch in the non - crosslinked polymer melts are non - uniform , the ccr is non - uniform .",
    "the rate of ccr is a function of both the contour variable and time .",
    "we assume that when the entanglement is convected away from the primitive chain segment to some other place , the previously formed environment has changed and this entanglement then becomes released .",
    "based on this idea , we develop a new contour - variable model including non - uniform segmental stretch , non - uniform rate of ccr and non - gaussian chain to describe the rheological behavior of linear chain entangled system in simple shearing and transient flows . however , we dropped the reptative constraint release term in the present work as we focus on the high - shear - rate region , where the segmental orientation and stretch are obvious . in the low - shear - rate region ,",
    "the reptative constraint release occurs on a time scale of the reptation time of the whole chain and one event only relaxes a small part of the chain ( graham et al . ,",
    "2003 ) ; while in the high - shear - rate region , the ccr dominates .",
    "thus in both of these two cases it is valid to drop the reptative constraint release term . while in some middle region",
    ", some quantitative deviations occur if we drop the reptative constraint release term .",
    "we also neglected the contribution from the fluctuations of the contour variable , as the problem is considered in the mean - field level .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec .",
    "2 ] we develop a contour - variable dependent rate of ccr to describe the flow induced constraint release and construct the new equations which the segmental stretch and the tube survival probability satisfy , respectively .",
    "we promote our contour - variable model of constitutive equations in the end of this section . in section [ sec .",
    "3 ] we give the results and discussion , in which we focus on the simple steady shear flow and the start - up of steady shear flow . in section [ sec .",
    "4 ] , we give the conclusions . the process and methods used for the calculation of constitutive equations are shown in the appendix .",
    "ccr represents the entanglements relaxation mechanics caused by the convective motion of surrounding chains .",
    "it is not important when the concentrated system is at rest or undergoes a slow flow .",
    "however , when the velocity of the flow is comparable to the inverse of reptation time of the primitive chain , ccr will play a key role in determining the dynamics of the system .",
    "taking into account the ccr mechanics , ianniruberto and marrucci ( 1996 ) proposed a contour location independent rate of ccr . in this model , the rate of ccr is only caused by the retraction of the primitive chain ends . so",
    "the rate of ccr is proportional to the velocity gradient of the movement of the primitive chain ends .",
    "however , not all convections or deformations will release constraint . in order to exclude the case of affine deformations , in which no constraint release occurs , mead et al .",
    "gives the rate of ccr as the difference between the rate of convection of the entanglements and the rate of primitive chain retraction ( mead et al . , 1998 ; viovy et al . , 1983 ) .",
    "they only evaluate the rate of ccr at the chain ends , since they think the topological constraint can be released only by the motion of chain ends ( ianniruberto and marrucci , 1996 ; marrucci et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "( we call it the end - relaxation mechanism in the follows . )    in the present work , we focus on the non - uniform behavior of ccr .",
    "let us consider a primitive chain segment confined by a tube segment which was created at past time @xmath2 , as called the @xmath2-segment .",
    "the deformation of this chain segment will be released when the entanglements forming the tube segments are convected away by the flow .",
    "it is an irreversible process .",
    "this @xmath2-segment will never be created again .",
    "when this happens , some hidden entanglements become active ( ianniruberto and marrucci , 2000 ) , which instantaneously makes the released part ( e.g. the @xmath2-segment ) become a part of a new tube .",
    "thus we can say that the rate of creating a new segment is the same as that of annihilating an old segment .",
    "the contribution to the stress for a specified tube only comes from the part that remain unreleased .",
    "the released part of the original tube , which becomes a part of a new tube , will still have contributions to the stress .",
    "however , the stress should be calculated from the new tube .",
    "define @xmath3 as the equilibrium contour variable , which runs from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the equilibrium length of the primitive chain .",
    "when the chain is stretched , its primitive length @xmath7 can be larger than @xmath6 .",
    "we then define a local stretch function @xmath8 which takes the value from @xmath9 to @xmath10 , to describe the segmental stretch .",
    "we can define @xmath11 as a local strain .",
    "it describes the local extension .",
    "the rate of ccr @xmath12 can be written as the following form @xmath13 where is the velocity gradient tensor of the flow , which , we suppose , is homogeneous , although in general it is not ; @xmath14 is the orientational tensor , @xmath15 . apparently , it is a local approximation form . the first term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) describes the rate of entanglements convection at contour variable @xmath3 and @xmath16 .",
    "the second term is used to exclude the case of affine deformation , in which there are no environment changes with respect to the primitive chain and no ccr happens . as @xmath17 , @xmath18 , from eq .",
    "( 1 ) we then find no ccr happens at the chain ends of the primitive chain .",
    "in fact the ends of the tube change instantaneously with the ends of the primitive chain during movement , there is no relative motion between the ends of the tube and the ends of the primitive chain . the primitive chain and the tube",
    "are intrinsically synonymous , we treat them as different things only for convenience in describing the motion of the chain considered and the motion of its surrounding chains .",
    "the difficulty of the flow - reversal problem has be pointed out ( wapperom and keunings , 2000 ; ianniruberto and marrucci , 2001 ) .",
    "if the present model reduces to the uniform and single - relaxation - time version , this problem can be amended using the absolute value of @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) . in the present non - uniform case",
    ", we suppose that the above expression can amend this difficulty . in the following",
    "we will not write the absolute value sign in the rate of ccr by considering the flow only in one direction .",
    "the dynamics of segmental stretch is described by the equation of motion , in which we neglect the acceleration term .",
    "it is derived from the force balance between the segmental extension force caused by the flow and the entropic elastic force .",
    "if the chain is considered to be non - gaussian , this equation can be written as ( mead and leal , 1995a , b ) @xmath20 \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 s}{\\partial s_{0}^{2}}\\right).\\ ] ] here @xmath21 is the relative pre - averaged tangential velocity with respect to the center of chain @xmath22 the parameter @xmath23 is the number of entanglements in a primitive chain , where @xmath24 is the molecular weight between two entanglements .",

    "@xmath30 ensures that the magnitude of a fictitious force acting along the primitive chain is equal to @xmath34 when there is no segmental extension ( doi and edwards , 1986 ; marrucci and grizzuti , 1988 ) . here",
    ", @xmath35 is the step length of the primitive chain and is a constant in the present model . a good discussion for its magnitude is given by milner ( 2005 ) .",
    "the inverse langevin function @xmath36 with the fractional extension @xmath37 is used to describe the tension of a non - gaussian finitely extensible polymer segment ( treloar , 1975 ) , which satisfies the following equation @xmath38 expanding @xmath36 in a taylor series and using pad approximation ( cohen , 1991 ) , we can obtain @xmath39 we differentiate both sides of eq .",

    "( 6 ) into the above equation , we obtain @xmath42 taking into account the effect of ccr and following the argument by mead , larson and doi ( 1998 ) , finally we obtain @xmath43 the parameter @xmath44 comes from the fact that the magnitude of the rate of entanglements reduction due to ccr is two times as large as the rate of segmental retraction . the boundary condition and the initial condition are @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively .",
    "the boundary condition is specified by the untethered condition of the chain ends which can never be stretched .",
    "the process of the segmental orientation can be described by the tube survival probability @xmath47 , which means that a tube segment created at past time _",

    "when the segmental stretch is taken into account , such as the demg model , a convective term has to be added to the de model .",
    "this term accounts for the flow induced convection of the _ defects _ to the ends of the primitive chain and the elongation of the tube segments .",
    "however , the orientation relaxation induced by constraint release has not been considered . without",
    "that it makes the prediction of the rheological properties by these models qualitatively different from the experimental results .    based on our understanding for the effect of constraint release , we modify the ccr term in the equation of the probability of tube survival in mld model and drop the term which comes from the reptative constraint release . including the contribution from chain stretch , the equation for the probability of the tube survival is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the tube strain function . the boundary condition and the initial condition are @xmath52 and @xmath53respectively",

    "when @xmath60 is large , the contribution from the last term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 12 ) is much smaller .",
    "however , when @xmath60 approaches to unity , this term plays an important role .",
    "this is arisen from the large difference in the time scale between the reptation time and the rouse retraction time .",
    "it means that the relaxation of the tube orientation caused by constraint release of surrounding chains should start to happen just when the primitive chain nearly finish its retraction .",
    "the boundary condition is @xmath61 and the initial condition is @xmath62 note that @xmath63 is the probability function , which has a range from 0 to 1 .",
    "the stress is the sum of tensile force of the primitive chain projecting to some direction @xmath64 by averaging over the conformations of primitive chains .",

    "we can obtain the solutions of these equations .",
    "the details are shown in the appendix .",
    "the constitutive parameters in these equations include @xmath91 and @xmath92 . here ,",
    "@xmath91 is the number of entanglements per chain and can be specified by fitting the steady state predictions of the model and the experimental data .",
    "a larger @xmath91 corresponds to a shorter rouse relaxation time .",
    "@xmath92 is the ratio between the equilibrium and the maximum length of the primitive chain , reflecting the extensibility of the chain .      in this section ,",
    "we show the dynamic properties of the chain segments and rheological behavior under steady shear flow .",
    "1 gives the non - uniform segmental stretch of the primitive chain with different shear rates .",
    "the parameters are chosen as @xmath93 and @xmath94 which denote the gaussian chain . due to",
    "the untethered fact of the chain ends , the segments at chain ends remain unstretched .",
    "there exists a maximum value of stretch at the center .",
    "the extension of the segments equivalently reduces the diffusion coefficient by @xmath95 in eq .  ( 19 ) .",
    "so the equivalent reduction of diffusion is much more at the center .",
    "in addition to a small value of the rate of segmental convection around the center , we find that the rate of tube relaxation , or the rate of tube creation , is relatively small at the center .",
    "the cancellation of gradually increasing rate of convection and decreasing rate of effective diffusion from the center to ends induces a flat region of the rate of the tube relaxation around the center . according to the calculation from eq .",
    "( 16 ) under steady state shear , we find that around the center of the tube the value of @xmath96 is relatively small . at the ends , where the segments of tube disappear at their creating time , @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , there must be a maximum value of @xmath96 in some location between the center and the ends .",
    "this can be seen from fig .  2 when the shear rate is high enough .",
    "it is very interesting that when the shear rate is high enough , the maximum contribution to stress from segmental orientation comes neither from the ends of the chain nor from the center , but from some other location in between .",
    "moreover , this location will move towards the ends when the shear rate grows higher . from the calculation we also find that the segmental orientation is insensitive to the entanglement number of a primitive chain , denoted as @xmath91 which determines the segmental extension in steady state .",
    "3 shows the differences of @xmath96 between the present model and demg model for @xmath93 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "the result shows that including of the ccr term will obviously enhance the value of @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , the magnitude of the stress in fast flow is seriously underestimated in the demg model .",
    "the comparisons of the shear stress and the steady state shear viscosity with different values of @xmath91 are given in fig .",
    "4 . in the linear region , where the steady shear rate is smaller than the inverse of reptation time ,",
    "both the shear stresses and steady state shear viscosity are independent of @xmath91 , because in these cases the shear rates are not high enough to stretch the chain segments . when the shear rate is high enough , the segments will be stretched to many times of their equilibrium length .",
    "the larger extension of the segment is , the more it contributes to the shear stress . on the other hand , the rouse relaxation time @xmath27 determines the magnitude of segmental extension .",
    "if @xmath27 is larger , which corresponds to a smaller @xmath91 , the shear stress will be larger .",
    "4 also shows the shear viscosity of the steady state which is defined as @xmath99 .",
    "when the shear rate is smaller than the inverse of reptation time , it behaves as newtonian fluid . while in the high - shear - rate region it markedly depends on the shear rate .",
    "different segmental stretch results in the differences of the first normal stress difference in the high - shear - rate region , which can be seen in fig .",
    "the same characteristics for the primary normal stress coefficients are also shown in fig .",
    "up to now the chains are approximated as gaussian chains ( @xmath94 ) , which is valid if the stains are not too large . however , under fast flow the chains are largely stretched and approach to their limiting extensible values , the gaussian treatment is no longer valid . in the following",
    ", we will use the non - gaussian treatment of the single chain taking into account the finite extensibility of the chain ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "6 shows the comparisons of the shear stress and the first normal stress difference with respect to the shear rate with different extensibilities for @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath91 is chosen as @xmath93 .",
    "the calculation also indicates that for a specified value of the shear rate segmental orientation is not sensitive to segmental extensibility . from fig .",
    "6 it can be found that the curves of shear stress and first normal stress difference are independent of segmental extensibility in the small shear rate region where the stress contribution from segmental stretch can be ignored . in the high - shear - rate region ,",
    "the differences of shear stress and the differences of the first normal stress caused by the differences of segmental extensibility are mainly contributed from segmental extension .",
    "the segmental orientation is only determined by the value of the shear rate , and is independent of the segmental stretch , because they are considered as independent processes .",
    "6 also shows the comparisons between the predictions of the present model and the experimental data ( pattamaprom and larson , 2001 ) of the stresses and the first normal stress differences under steady shear for different parameters of @xmath92 ; fig .",
    "7 shows the comparisons with experimental data of the stresses and the first normal stress differences under steady shear for different parameters of @xmath91 . by fitting the experimental data , we find that incorporating the non - uniform features to the constitutive models does not affect rheological properties .",
    "moreover , the non - uniform model gives us the detailed descriptions of the chain dynamics . in the present model",
    "there are two modifiable parameters of @xmath91 and @xmath92 . by fitting the experimental data to the predictions of the present model ,",
    "we can obtain the values of @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "the comparison between them will show you the relative abilities of the retraction and the extension of the chains .",
    "this means that , under the same magnitude of shear rate , different abilities of retraction or extension will result in different magnitudes of stresses , although the molecules composing the materials may have the same volume fractions and molecular weights . from these two figures , quantitative deviation from the experimental data exists , especially the first normal stress difference in the high - shear - rate region .",
    "these deviations may attribute to the  nonlocal \" interactions between chains . by comparing with the uniform models by pattamaprom and larson ( 2001 )",
    ", we also find that the effect of non - uniform ccr on the stress and the normal stress is minor .",
    "the details of segmental orientation and stretch are not important in determining the rheological properties in steady simple shear .      the transient behavior of chain stretch and orientation , as well as the rheological properties , are discussed in this section .",
    "the steady shear is imposed to the system at @xmath103 .    in fig .",
    "8 the segmental stretch varying with time at different shear rates are shown , and the constitutive parameters are chosen as @xmath104 .",
    "the contour variable is focused at @xmath105 .",
    "before this segment reaches its steady value of extension , it passes a maximum value which is dependent on the shear rate , since other parameters are fixed .",
    "this maximum value will appear earlier when the shear rate increases .",
    "9 gives the behavior of segmental orientation @xmath106 with the constitutive parameters chosen as the same in fig .",
    "we focus on the location @xmath105 .",
    "if the shear rate is of the order of @xmath107 or larger , the value of @xmath106 will also pass a maximum value before reaching its steady value .",
    "the appearance of the maximum value is not due to the fact of segmental stretch , but the existence of a maximum value in the strain @xmath108 with respect to the time .",
    "10 and fig .",
    "11 show the transient behavior of the shear stress and the first normal stress difference , respectively , where overshoots are predicted in the present model . for the shear stress ,",
    "when the shear rate is higher than the inverse of reptation time , the overshoot appears .",
    "the overshoot of the first normal stress difference appears at a much higher shear rate in the present model than that in other models .",
    "the reason is that the appearance of maximum in the first normal stress difference is determined by the evolvement of segmental stretch which should also have a maximum in the course of time .",
    "however , the rate of ccr we obtained contains a local strain @xmath109 , which largely decreases the maximum value of segmental stretch and subsequently the stress .",
    "thus the magnitude of the start - up shear rate , which can produce a overshoot , increases .",
    "12 and fig .",
    "13 show the comparisons of the shear viscosities and the first normal stress differences with the experimental results , respectively .",
    "we choose the shear viscosities instead of the shear stresses for convenience to compare with the experimental data ( pattamaprom and larson , 2001 ) , in which the material is sample one . the parameters in these two figures are both chosen as @xmath93 and @xmath94 , @xmath110 , @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "the results indicate that only when the shear rate is high , i.e. @xmath111 , the differences caused by the different values of @xmath92 are predicted by the present model",
    ". if the chains are less extensible , which corresponds to a large value of @xmath92 , the segmental extension will be smaller under the same shear rate at the same time .",
    "this leads to smaller shear viscosities as well as the first normal stress differences .",
    "in fact , the segmental orientation is mainly determined by the magnitude of the start - up shear rate . when the shear rate is fixed the contribution from orientation to shear stress",
    "is specified .",
    "thus , the magnitude of segmental stretch plays a critical role in determining the final value of the shear stress , and subsequently the shear viscosity .",
    "this is kept when the first normal stress difference is considered . by fitting the experimental data we find that the predictions of the present model have the same tendency with the experimental curves . on the other hand ,",
    "there are large inconsistencies when the quantitative values are concerned , especially the magnitude of overshoots . both the shear stress and the normal stress overshoots in the present model are very weak comparing to the experimental data",
    "it is obvious that the chain stretch is not enough , which may arise from the inclusion of local approximation in ccr in the present model .",
    "in this paper , we develop a contour - variable model to describe the non - uniform behavior of segments under steady shear and start - up of steady shear , and the subsequent contributions to the shear stress and the first normal stress difference .",
    "the present model is a modification of the mld model with a modified ccr term and non - gaussian chain treatment of the single chain .",
    "we drop the contour length fluctuation contribution and neglect the reptative constraint release term , since both of them contribute less than the shear rate dependent ccr term in the high - shear - rate region .",
    "the numerical results predict strong dependencies of the segmental stretch and orientation on the contour variable .",
    "the maximum extension happens in the center of the chain due to the demand of symmetry .",
    "the fact that segmental extension passes a maximum during the start - up of steady shear flow is the key reason why the first normal stress difference has a maximum .",
    "the segmental orientation also shows a maximum in the center when shear rate is small , and this is mainly attributed to the reptation .",
    "however , when the shear rate is high enough the segmental convection begins to work .",
    "a maximum of segmental orientation appears in some locations between the center and the end , where the stress contribution from orientation is the largest .",
    "the inclusion of ccr entirely promotes the magnitude of orientation of each segment rather than changes the distribution of the value of segmental orientation . the non - uniform segmental orientation and stretch subsequently contribute to rheological properties , which qualitatively agree with experimental data , although quantitative deviation still exists . when the shear rate is high , i.e. @xmath112 , the segmental strain is larger than 1 .",
    "the difference of the segmental extensibilities is the main reason for the difference of rheological behavior .",
    "the same properties hold in the start - up of steady shear .",
    "this validates our pre - approximation of the independence of segmental stretch and orientation .",
    "a few approximations have been used in the present model .",
    "one is the local approximation of ccr .",
    "ccr happens once a tube segment is convected away from its original location , since the relative position to the primitive - chain segment confined by this tube segment changes .",
    "the convection of a segment may not be only determined by its local conditions , but all other segments elsewhere .",
    "in fact , the present model only predicts the overshoots in shear viscosity and first normal stress difference under the start - up of steady shear , but does not predict undershoots which have been observed in experiments ( huppler et al .",
    ", 1967 ; mhetar and archer , 2000 ) .",
    "it is well known that the appearance of overshoots is due to segmental stretch .",
    "how about the undershoots ?",
    "pattamaprom and larson ( 2001 ) predicted that the undershoots would appear if the dependence of the orientation and stretch on the contour variable was taken into account .",
    "the present model indicates that the inclusion of `` local '' non - uniform rate of ccr to the constitutive equations does not predict undershoots .",
    "undershoots may appear if we include the nonlocal interaction into the model .",
    "that is the coupling between chains , e.g. the hydrodynamic interactions , which are neglected in the present model .",
    "another is that we suppose the shear flow is homogeneous , which in general is not .",
    "at last we can say that in polymer melts under shear non - uniform segmental orientation and stretch are hard to be observed directly in experiments , but their effect on rheological behavior can be detected , though the influences of the microscopic non - uniform behavior on them is not remarkable .",
    "however , the processes of crystallization and the dynamics of phase separation ( maurits and fraaije , 1997 ) should be significantly affected by these contour dependent quantities , as the segmental dynamics plays a crucial rule in these processes .",
    "in fact the kinetic coefficients are related to the non - uniform features ( kawasaki and sekimoto , 1988 ; kawakatsu , 1997 ) .",
    "it is of great significance to investigate the segmental dynamics and their affiliated properties theoretically by microscopic or mesoscopic models .",
