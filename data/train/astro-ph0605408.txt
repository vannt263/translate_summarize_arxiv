    "since the discovery of the gb as a system of bright stars forming an angle of about @xmath0 with the galactic disk @xcite , many efforts have been devoted to unravel its complex structure of stars and the associated interstellar medium . when studies of its kinematics began to appear on the second half of the past century , the peculiarities of its behavior made the global picture of the gb even more puzzling .",
    "the most striking discovery was the expansion motion of the stellar component @xcite , which can not be satisfactorily explained by a single explosive event @xcite , making it difficult to trace back the origin of the gb by reversing this movement .",
    "models considering galactic density waves generated by perturbations from the spiral arms can not account for this expansion either @xcite .",
    "also , the shell of gas associated with the gb present evidences of an expansion movement , according to the works of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    because the age of the gb ( between 20 and 90 myr , see @xcite for a detailed discussion )",
    "is a considerable fraction of the period of vertical oscillation of the stars over the galactic plane under the influence of the gravitational potential of the galaxy , the spatial coherence of the gb must be corresponded by a kinematical coherence that prevents the dissolution of the structure among the galactic plane . @xcite and @xcite find a global oscillation movement of the gb around an axis different from the spatial line of nodes where the gb and the galactic plane cross each other .",
    "all this leads @xcite to include the gb as part of the hierarchy of stellar complexes within the milky way , as a second level structure subordinated to the local arm ( the orion - cygnus spur ) .",
    "thus , the gb would be the star formation complex closest to us , so the study of its global properties will contribute to shed light on the possible origin and evolution of these complexes .    in a previous article ( elias et al .",
    "2006 , from now on referred to as paper i ) we had developed a three - dimensional spatial classification method to separate the gb stars from the lgd stars . having obtained the structural parameters of both systems exclusively by spatial considerations , we now shall classify a sample of _ hipparcos _ @xcite ob stars with space velocities , in order to compare the kinematics of both structures .    thus , in section 2 we first build a sample of o - b6 _ hipparcos _ stars with proper motions and radial velocity data , that we then analyze in order to study the kinematic properties of the young galactic disk .",
    "we begin ( section 3 ) by the identification of the moving groups in the velocity field , and then ( section 3.1 ) we separate the gb from the lgd stars , which allows us to decide about the membership to either system of the detected moving groups .",
    "the next step to enhance our analysis of the young disk velocity field is the elimination of the systematic effects on the velocities by the solar motion and the galactic differential rotation .",
    "we obtain the residual velocities , the analysis of which also yields a different kinematic behavior of the gb and the lgd ( section 4 ) .",
    "the study of the velocity ellipsoids confirms such difference ( section 4.1 ) .",
    "the effect of the gb on the determination of the oort constants is addressed in section 5 .",
    "finally , some conclusions are exposed in section 6 .",
    "we select a sample of 1156 stars of spectral types o - b6 and luminosity classes iii , iv and v from the _ hipparcos _ catalogue @xcite .",
    "photometric data from the @xcite catalogue , as well as radial velocity data from the @xcite and @xcite catalogues have been added when available .",
    "thus , the compilation includes :    * hip , _ hipparcos _ identifier number * spectral type * @xmath1 , johnson visual magnitude * trigonometric parallax ( mas ) * standard error in trigonometric parallax ( mas ) * right ascension for the epoch j1991.5 in icrs ( degrees ) * declination for the epoch j1991.5 in icrs ( degrees ) * proper motion in right ascension , @xmath2 ( mas yr@xmath3 ) * standard error in proper motion in right ascension ( mas yr@xmath3 ) * proper motion in declination , @xmath4 ( mas yr@xmath3 ) * standard error in proper motion in declination ( mas yr@xmath3 ) * radial velocity ( km s@xmath3 ) from @xcite * quality of radial velocity from @xcite * radial velocity ( km s@xmath3 ) from @xcite * error in radial velocity ( km s@xmath3 ) from @xcite * @xmath5 photometry data from @xcite    for the distance estimation we have used _ hipparcos _ trigonometric parallaxes only if the relative error is lower or equal to a @xmath6 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath5 strmgren photometry has been used to estimate the distance through the @xcite @xmath7 calibration .",
    "if no data were available , spectro - photometric distances from the apparent visual magnitude @xmath1 and the @xcite calibration for the spectral types have been chosen .",
    "we have compared the three different distance estimations , looking for any possible systematic biases among them . with this purpose ,",
    "we have selected 950 stars from the initial catalog with strmgren photometry data .",
    "several authors @xcite , studying the distance calibration comparisons with the distances obtained from trigonometric parallaxes , have dealt with the problem of analyzing the biases that the sample selection effects introduce .",
    "the estimation of these biases is very complex because it depends , among other variables , on the spatial distribution of the sample .",
    "@xcite demonstrates that the real distance probability distribution for individual stars will always be ill - behaved when that distance tends to infinite and a constant underlying spatial distribution has been assumed for the sample .",
    "this idea had already been suggested by @xcite , who propose that -in order to avoid any truncation biases- for comparison purposes it should be used a sample not selected by any limit in the relative error of the trigonometric parallax , including also the negative parallaxes .",
    "we use this methodology for the comparison between trigonometric , photometric and spectroscopic parallaxes , using the complete sample with spectral types up to b6 .",
    "the result of the analysis demonstrates that the strmgren photometric parallaxes ( @xmath8 ) are very similar to the _ hipparcos _ trigonometric parallaxes -as @xcite had already demonstrated- , but the former present , in comparison with the spectroscopic parallaxes ( @xmath9 , derived from the schmidt - kaler calibration ) , a functional relationship in the form of @xmath10 .",
    "nevertheless , a recent study for the o stars @xcite demonstrates that the _ hipparcos _ trigonometric parallaxes and the spectroscopic parallaxes are very similar for this spectral type .",
    "where does this difference that we find in their values come from ?",
    "we have to consider that our spectroscopic calibration is based on three steps : 1.- spectral classification ; 2.- calibration of the absolute magnitude for each spectral type ; 3.- evaluation of the reddening from the intrinsic color values .",
    "the spectral classification of the _ hipparcos _ catalog comes from different sources and thus is far from being uniform . on the other hand ,",
    "the catalog of o stars @xcite used by @xcite for the comparison of the parallaxes was derived from a group of homogeneous and precise stellar spectra .",
    "thus , it must not be inferred from our result that the schmidt - kaler calibration has systematic biases , but that the spectroscopic parallaxes of the o - b6 stars from the _ hipparcos _ catalog -according to the spectral classification within the catalog- show a systematic error when we compare them with the strmgren photometric parallaxes ( which , as we said , bear no significative difference with the _ hipparcos _ trigonometric parallaxes ) .    in this work",
    ", we do not intend to perform an exhaustive study of the problems that the diverse methodologies of obtaining distance calibrations arise .",
    "we have just unified for working reason the different distance calibrations used for our sample . for that",
    ", we have tied the spectroscopic parallaxes to those derived from strmgren photometry , applying a correction of 21% to the former .",
    "we want to stress that the comparison between the different distance calibrations has been made strictly through their respective parallaxes .",
    "we have also chosen the @xcite radial velocity and quality data when available ; otherwise , radial velocities and errors from @xcite have been used .",
    "finally , a distance limit of 1 kpc has been imposed , thus reducing the sample to 881 stars .    while the _ hipparcos _ catalogue is complete down to @xmath11 , and to @xmath12 for o - b6 stars , in figure 1 we can see through a histogram that our sample is complete only down to a magnitude of @xmath13 .",
    "this is caused by the necessity of having radial velocity data available for the stars in our sample , as it is also observed in @xcite ; in that work , the completeness of the sample of o and b stars from the _ hipparcos _ catalogue falls down from @xmath11 to @xmath14 when the stars without radial velocity data are removed .",
    "we have calculated the space velocities from the proper motions and the radial velocities @xcite for the stars in our sample .",
    "their density field is represented in the three contour plots of figure 2 .",
    "we appreciate in this image that the velocity field is dominated by several maxima which may correspond to associations of stars ( not necessarily bound ) with a small velocity dispersion , known as moving groups ( e.g. proctor 1869 ; eggen 1963 ) .    the first and most prominent maximum , located around @xmath15 km s@xmath3 , is certainly associated with the pleiades moving group .",
    "the exact situation of the peak may differ slightly from the estimation given by other authors , but we must consider that the moving group always appears as a maximum in the velocity space with a certain width .",
    "for instance , @xcite , working with a sample of b , a and f stars from the hipparcos input catalogue @xcite and @xmath5 photometry , find that the maximum is located at @xmath16 km s@xmath3 , the standard deviation for the three components being , respectively , @xmath17 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the second most prominent peak in figure 2 is located around @xmath18 km s@xmath3 .",
    "we have identified it as the moving group related to the supercluster ic 2391 .",
    "its position in velocity space is estimated by @xcite at @xmath19 km s@xmath3 , the standard deviation being @xmath20 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the third maximum , centered around @xmath21 km s@xmath3 , is more diffuse and difficult to identify .",
    "we have decided to follow the criteria of @xcite , who -based on the studies by @xcite- rule out the possibility of linking this region in the velocity space with the coma berenices cluster , in favor of a probable bond with the cassiopeia - taurus association , of @xmath22 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this association has an age between 50 myr -as the probable expansion age estimated by @xcite from a sample of stars of spectral type b5 or earlier- and @xmath23 myr , as determined from the lithium depletion boundary by @xcite . in the detailed study of the nearby ob associations by @xcite",
    "the authors find a physical relation between the cas - tau group and the @xmath24 persei cluster .",
    "the main sequence turn - off age for this cluster is about 50 myr @xcite , so the age of both cas - tau and @xmath24 persei could be the same ( e.g. brown 2002 ) .",
    "note that in paper i we found that @xmath24 persei is located well within the spatial boundaries of the gb .      in order to observe how these moving groups contribute to the two systems in study",
    ", we classify the sample and determine the membership of the stars to either the gb or the lgd . in paper",
    "i we obtained several estimations of the parameters that characterize both systems in our model .",
    "we shall work with the solution for the full o - b6 sample of paper i with an exponential model for the stellar distribution in the direction perpendicular to the mean planes .",
    "thus , using that estimation as the true value of the gb and the lgd mean planes , we simply apply our separation algorithm to our current star sample with kinematic data .",
    "no iteration in order to re - evaluate the mean planes is performed , we just assign membership probabilities to the stars according to the planes estimated in paper i. also , spatial outliers are eliminated according to the procedure explained in that paper ; the remaining sample has 776 stars .",
    "we obtain a separation between the gb and the lgd based exclusively in the spatial position of these stars .",
    "yet we can see in figure 3 how a difference in their velocity fields is obtained as a result .",
    "the most striking difference is that in the @xmath25 projection ( top panels of figure 3 ) the three moving groups that we had found in the full sample ( top panel of figure 2 ) now distinctly belong either to the gb or the lgd .",
    "the two maxima associated with the pleiades and ic 2391 appear only in the gb velocity field ( figure 3 , top left panel ) , while the cassiopeia - taurus peak remains only visible in the lgd field ( figure 3 , top right panel ) .",
    "this is not surprising , if we consider that the pleiades moving group is spatially related to the sco - cen association , which is one of the main components of the gb @xcite .",
    "also , we know that ic 2391 is a young cluster , its age being about 30 myr @xcite . in a recent study of the tangential velocities , @xcite conclude that its kinematic probability of belonging to the gb is a @xmath26 .",
    "note that we have arrived to a similar conclusion by a process based solely on the spatial position of the stars , and thus independent of the result in the cited paper .",
    "we must also note that a late - type population of young stars has been associated to both the pleiades and ic 2391 by @xcite . in that paper , these moving groups are described as centered around @xmath27 and @xmath28 km s@xmath3 , respectively , with a dispersion of about 8 km s@xmath3 around the central positions .",
    "not surprisingly , a late - type component of stars of about 30 - 80 myr of age had already been associated to the gb disk structure by @xcite studying the x - ray sources in the rosat all - sky survey .",
    "finally , we also observe that in the @xmath29 projection ( figure 3 , middle right panel ) it clearly rises a new maximum that has a correspondence with a small protuberance around @xmath30 km s@xmath3 in the @xmath25 projection ( figure 3 , top right panel ) .",
    "it was also present , although weak , in the velocity density field of the full sample ( figure 2 , top and middle panels ) .",
    "we havent found an exact correspondence to this possible moving group among the structures in the solar neighborhood , but the positive value of the @xmath31 component makes us think that it may be related to the sirius supercluster ( eg . eggen 1996 , dehnen 1998 , asiain et al .",
    "if we want to improve our study of the kinematic differences between the gb and the lgd , we must work with residual velocities .",
    "this way , the systematic effects of the galactic kinematics will not interfere with our comparison .",
    "thus , we now correct the space velocities of the stars in our sample from solar motion ( using the classical estimation of @xcite , ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) = ( 9 , 12 , 7 ) km s@xmath3 ) and from galactic differential rotation -using the values given by @xcite .    in order to refine the analysis of the velocity distributions , we must also eliminate outliers of kinematic nature that may be present in the sample .",
    "that is , we eliminate the stars located in the regions of a very low density in the velocity space for our sample under study .",
    "we achieve this by running the outker algorithm @xcite , which reduces the sample to a final number of 752 stars .",
    "we then separate again the sample into gb and lgd members.now we want to compare both distributions in a n - dimensional space , where n=6 ( phase space ) or n=3 ( velocity space ) . in order to achieve this",
    ", we employ a multidimensional , non - parametric two - samples test : the cramer test @xcite .",
    "the test statistic is the difference of the sum of all the euclidean interpoint distances between the random variables from the two different samples :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the point vectors of each sample member , and m , n are the respective size of the samples .",
    "@xmath38 is a kernel function ; for this particular case we have used the cramer kernel implemented by @xcite in the r statistical environment @xcite .",
    "thus , an analysis of the three - dimensional velocity space , @xmath39 , yields that the gb and the lgd distributions are different with a 99% of confidence .",
    "similarly , the cramer test for the six dimensions of the phase space , @xmath40 , rejects the possibility that the gb and the lgd distributions are the same with a confidence of a 99% .",
    "thus we confirm that the gb and the lgd are two different stellar systems in the sense that they show a clear statistical separation between their distributions in the phase space .",
    "it is unavoidable to take into consideration the contribution of the gb when the young disk is under study , because , as we have demonstrated , the velocities of the ob stars in the solar neighborhood are not statistically independent of their spatial positions .",
    "a more intuitive visualization of the differences between the gb and the lgd residual velocity distributions are the contour density plots of the three different velocity planes ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "their disparate shapes and orientations already show that the velocity ellipsoids clearly reflect the distinct kinematic behavior of both stellar systems .",
    "we have estimated the main geometrical parameters of the velocity ellipsoids for the whole sample and for the gb and the lgd members separately .",
    "the results are displayed on table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "two main results arise from this analysis :    1 .",
    "the vertex deviation for the gb is highly negative , while that for the lgd is positive .",
    "2 .   there is the suggestion that the third axis of the velocity ellipsoid for the gb is tilted in respect to the galactic plane .",
    "the estimation of the vertex deviation in the solar neighborhood from different star samples has produced different values depending on the nature of the sample and on the kinematic variables used in the calculation ( see @xcite for a compilation of previous results ) . in brief",
    ", the general conclusion has been that the vertex deviation becomes more negative as the star sample is younger .",
    "in fact , one of the classic estimates based on space velocities for ob stars @xcite yielded a value close to @xmath41 for the galactic disk . for years , this result has remained a puzzling issue that has been given several and varied explanations .",
    "most of them can be classified into two classical types : nature or nurture , we could say .",
    "some authors claim that these young stars that formed from a molecular cloud show the same kinematics as the parent cloud at the time of the star formation .",
    "this way , the initial velocity and later expansion define the velocity ellipsoid of the present stellar system .",
    "other authors , though , defend that the effect of different singular and punctual events ( such as the passing through a spiral arm ) could also be the cause of the peculiar velocity ellipsoid observed in the young stellar component .",
    "what we conclude from our analysis is that the classic problem of the negative vertex deviation for young stars in the solar neighborhood is a consequence of the presence of the gb . if we eliminate the stars that belong to the gb , the remaining sample of only lgd stars present a positive vertex deviation ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "@xcite , working with a sample of dwarf o - b5.5 stars members of the gb , found that the negative vertex deviation ( @xmath43 ) was caused by the pleiades moving group .",
    "once removed this group , they obtained a positive vertex deviation ( @xmath44 ) for the remaining stars in the gb .",
    "we now demonstrate the the ob stars of the lgd also have a positive vertex deviation , similar to that found by @xcite for the gb stars after eliminating the ones belonging to the pleiades moving group .",
    "so when we work with samples ( either of gb or lgd stars ) in which a single moving group clearly dominates over the others the vertex deviation is positive and close to @xmath45 , which is the value expected from the dynamic equations of the system for this age group .",
    "the negative vertex deviation of the gb seems to be originated by the relative position of the centroids of two moving groups rather than by the distribution of the residual velocities as a whole .",
    "we must note that the analysis of the young stars -specially those belonging to the gb- based on the schwarzschild distribution from which the velocity ellipsoid is tailored , is not the best suited to describe the reality of the system .",
    "the velocity field is dominated , as we have seen , by the presence of moving groups , and thus it is far from the hypothesis of a homogeneous and stationary system .",
    "the problem thus lies in that the classic analysis of the velocity ellipsoid is applied to a set of moving groups .",
    "already @xcite pointed out that the cause of the vertex deviation was the existence of moving groups in the galactic velocity field . but",
    "even though the velocity ellipsoid does not strictly correspond to a physic reality in our case , that does nt invalidate our result , that is , the fundamental contribution of the gb to the negative vertex deviation for the o and b stars .",
    "thus , the different values of the vertex deviation found in the literature can be explained according to the different proportions of gb stars present in the respective samples .",
    "this translates the question about the origin of the negative vertex deviation to the investigation of the origin of the moving groups .",
    "although the latter is out of the scope of this paper , we want to stress that the more we study in detail the nature of the gb , the more we find indications that we must probe both its nature and origin as a set of moving groups .",
    "crrr @xmath46 & @xmath47 & @xmath48 & @xmath49 + @xmath50 & @xmath51 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 + @xmath54 & @xmath55 & @xmath56 & @xmath57 + @xmath46 & @xmath58 & @xmath59 & @xmath60 + @xmath50 & @xmath61 & @xmath62 & @xmath63 + @xmath54 & @xmath64 & @xmath65 & @xmath66 + @xmath46 & @xmath67 & @xmath68 & @xmath53 + @xmath50 & @xmath69 & @xmath70 & @xmath71 + @xmath54 & @xmath72 & @xmath73 & @xmath74 +    another striking result is the inclination of the gb s velocity ellipsoid of about @xmath75 with respect to the @xmath25 plane , although this value does not have a great statistical significance .",
    "while the third axis ( @xmath54 ) of the lgd ellipsoid merely shows an inclination of @xmath76 , the gb s ellipsoid inclination ( 10 ) reminds that of the spatial system with respect to the galactic plane ( @xmath77 as we found in paper i ) .",
    "some authors have pointed out that the gb could be oscillating as a whole around the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "but our result does not discard a different interpretation in terms of a juxtaposition of moving groups : this links back to the idea that a descriptive parameter of the gb -such as this inclination of the minor axis of the ellipsoid- can be interpreted in terms of the relative position ( in the velocity space ) of two moving groups .",
    "although our sample hasnt been ideally compiled with the intention of calculating the oort constants , it is worth performing a basic estimation to obtain information about the gb s contribution to their value .",
    "thus , within the axisymmetric approximation of oort s model in first order , and including a @xmath78 expansion term , we solve the condition equations @xcite for the radial and the tangential velocities :    @xmath79    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the radial velocity ; @xmath82 @xmath83 and @xmath84 @xmath85 are the tangential velocities in galactic longitude ( @xmath86 ) and latitude ( @xmath87 ) , being @xmath88 and @xmath89 the respective proper motions and @xmath90 the heliocentric distance ; and @xmath91 , the reflex of the solar motion .    in principle",
    ", it would only make sense to estimate oort s constants for the lgd , eliminating the gb members from the sample .",
    "as we have seen , from the study of the moving groups and the velocity ellipsoid , the velocity distribution of the gb clearly deviates from the axisymmetric hypothesis ; hence , the oort constants would nt correspond to a physical reality in this case .",
    "yet we have solved the equations in order to establish a comparison and thus observe the effects that the presence of the gb introduces in the kinematics of the lgd .",
    "the solutions for the proper motions and for the radial velocity alone are listed on table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "the solar motion for the lgd proper motions solution is in good agreement with the iau standard , @xmath92 = ( 9 , 12 , 7 ) km s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "but the oort constants differ noticeably from the iau recommended values of @xmath93 = 14.4 @xmath94 1.2 km s@xmath3 kpc@xmath3 and @xmath95 = -12.0 @xmath94 2.8 km s@xmath3 kpc@xmath3 , and instead we have a flat rotation curve with @xmath93 = @xmath96 = 16 km s@xmath3 kpc@xmath3 . yet the value provided by @xcite is a mean over the results obtained by several authors , so it is more revealing to compare our estimation with that of a study similar to ours .",

    "but regardless of the numerical results , we can conclude too that the global kinematics of the gb differs greatly from the kinematics of the lgd , and that the presence of this stellar system affects the estimation of the parameters describing the kinematics of the solar neighborhood .",

    "now we have classified only by spatial criteria a sample of o - b6 stars from the _ hipparcos _ catalogue , and found that the gb s global kinematics is essentially different from the kinematics of the lgd . not only that , multidimensional two - samples tests prove that the gb and the lgd are separated systems in the phase space .",
    "this does not necessarily imply that the gb is a coherent structure born from a single source such as a great molecular cloud .",
    "we just note that in its present state , the gb is a local system ( whose size is well represented by our sample ) showing very different kinematic properties than the larger system in which it is embedded , the galactic disk .",
    "the fact that the gb is mainly composed of certain moving groups challenges the idea of this system coming from a single origin , and rises the question of whether we are witnessing a coherent structure with physical entity or we are just observing a transitory picture of several smaller systems with no common origin at all .",
    "the answer to this question can only be sought in the dynamical study of the moving groups that form the gb ( which would require a deep knowledge of the galactic potential and its asymmetries ) , in order to trace back their trajectories in the past and discover whether they come from a single protostellar cloud or they are the transitory result of some dynamical traps .",
    "we have also proved that the classic problem of the negative vertex deviation of young stars in the solar neighborhood is caused by the contribution of the gb .",
    "this effect disappears once this stellar system is removed from the sample , leaving the lgd -defined by its spatial distribution- as the only remaining structure .",
    "finally , we have observed how the presence of what is called the gb introduces disturbances in the estimation of the oort constants that describe the kinematics of the young galactic disk , making it necessary to discard its contribution by identifying and removing the gb members .",
    "once the young disk is pruned by eliminating the gb members , we estimate a flat rotation curve with a local velocity very close to the values calculated by several authors in the last decade for a wide range of ages .",
    "thus , although we find that the kinematic analysis is not enough to decipher the origin of the gb , it is indeed fundamental to characterize the complexity of the young galactic disk and to better understand the different moving groups that form the bulk of the gb stellar component .",
    "a comprehensive explanation of the origin of the gb will require a dynamical analysis of these moving groups .    f.e . wants to thank the departamento de fsica atmica , molecular y nuclear of the universidad de sevilla for its support during this work .",

    "<S> using the spatial classification method and the structural parameters estimated for the gould belt ( gb ) and the local galactic disk ( lgd ) from a previous paper , we have evaluated spatial membership probabilities for a sample of o and b stars from the _ hipparcos _ catalogue @xcite with available proper motions and radial velocity data . thus being able to study the space velocity fields of both systems , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the gb and the lgd present different statistical distributions , both in the velocity space as well as in the phase space . in the light of the existence of both systems </S>",
    "<S> we analyze different kinematic aspects in the vicinity of the sun , and we find the gb to be responsible for the highly negative vertex deviation found for the ob stars in the solar neighborhood . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the gb sensibly alters the estimation of oort s constants in the galactic disk ; thus , in order to establish comparisons with other kinematic studies based in older stellar populations , a careful pruning of the gb members must be performed . </S>",
    "<S> further analysis of the gb velocity field and the moving groups that contribute to it suggest the possibility that the gb can be the result of a chance superposition of moving groups . </S>",
    "<S> we propose for future investigations the dynamical analysis of these moving groups in order to probe the origin of the gb . </S>"
