    "<S> we present an approach for self - consistent calculations of the many - body green function in transition metals . </S>",
    "<S> the distinguishing feature of our approach is the use of the one - site approximation and the self - consistent quasiparticle wave function basis set , obtained from the solution of the schrodinger equation with a nonlocal potential . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze several sets of skeleton diagrams as generating functionals for the green function self - energy , including gw and fluctuating exchange sets . </S>",
    "<S> their relative contribution to the electronic structure in 3d - metals was identified . </S>",
    "<S> calculations for fe and ni revealed stronger energy dependence of the effective interaction and self - energy of the d - electrons near the fermi level  compared to s and p electron states . </S>",
    "<S> reasonable agreement with experimental results is obtained .    density - functional theory ( dft ) , </S>",
    "<S> in particular the local - density approximation ( lda ) , has proven to be a rather successful _ </S>",
    "<S> ab - initio _ approach to describe physical properties of many materials . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless numerous applications of this method have revealed a number of shortcomings related to the inadequate treatment of both excited ( energy gap ) and strongly correlated states . for a long time the many - body green function ( gf ) approach was considered as a possible _ ab - initio _ alternative to dft , but its current applicability is usually restricted to the homogeneous electron gas ( heg ) model@xcite or semiconductors in the gw approximation . </S>",
    "<S> however , realization of the full self - consistent gw scheme is complicated due to enormous computational difficulties . as a result , for the transition metals ( tm ) the gw approach was applied only to niarya1,arya2 and these calculations used the wave functions obtained within the lda as the basis set , i.e. they were not self - consistent . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is quite unlikely that a universal gf method can be formulated and tailoring the approximations to specific properties of a given class of materials is desirable . </S>",
    "<S> the localized character of the d - wave function in tm often implies the well - known one - site approximation@xcite which in real systems acquires certain material specific features .    </S>",
    "<S> already the calculations of refs.@xcite revealed a strong energy - dependence of the effective interaction in tm , even in the vicinity of the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> for example in ni the effective coulomb interaction @xmath0 is nearly zero at 6 ev and increases to an unscreened value of 20 - 25 ev at 20 ev . </S>",
    "<S> another important observation is related to a proper intra - atomic scale treatment . </S>",
    "<S> elementary analysis shows that the @xmath1- function in bcc fe is significantly altered at a distance as small as 0.8 a.u . , while @xmath2 and @xmath3 wave functions are altered at distances of about the wigner - seitz radius ( @xmath4 2.6 a.u . ) . </S>",
    "<S> the local  screening length , @xmath5 @xmath6 with @xmath7 which varies from 0.5 a.u . in the region of the maximum of the @xmath8wave function to a value of 1.0 a.u . at the atomic sphere ( as ) boundary , provides an initial justification for the one - site approximation and suggests that the correct material - specific implementation must include a spatially resolved representation of the polarization operator ( po ) and other two - channel operators , at least inside the as . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the energy dependence and intra - atomic resolution are both crucial for the quantitative description of tm and must be included explicitly in any reliable technique . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , we will show below that this approximation can describe the essential physics of tm , greatly reducing the computational efforts .    in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we incorporate the effects described above into the self - consistent gf technique using the quasiparticle wave function basis set and the luttinger - ward functional@xcite ( lwf ) approach for the self - energy calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we tested several sets of diagrams , mainly from the fluctuating - exchange subset ( flex)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all diagrams beyond these sets were taken in the local approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the use of the lwf guarantees the equivalence of one - particle properties calculated with the gf and with the corresponding total energy variation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lwf formalism naturally leads to the integration over the imaginary axis , greatly improving the numerical accuracy of the integration . on the imaginary axis both the gf and po </S>",
    "<S> quickly reach their quasiclassical limits , are sufficiently smooth , and are determined by the local potential onlyks . </S>",
    "<S> the rotation of the integration contour leads to a very convenient separation of the structural and local density dependent degrees of freedom for both self - energy and total energy@xcite . also , in contrast with the numerical method@xcite we analytically select the contributions from both the gf cut on the real axis and the integration along the imaginary axis . </S>",
    "<S> an energy linearization of the quasiparticle wave function similar to the one in linear density functional methods was used .    in terms of an exact gf the thermodynamic potential </S>",
    "<S> is written as@xcite @xmath9 \\right\\ } -tr\\sigma g-\\phi    \\label{lwf}\\]]where @xmath10 is the self - energy , g and g@xmath11 are exact and bare gf and @xmath12 is the luttinger generating functional , which is represented by the set of skeleton graphs . minimizing @xmath13 over @xmath14 one can obtainlw @xmath15the expressions for @xmath12 for the most important two - particle ( hole ) channels are summarized in ref .. the set from fig.1b with bare loops corresponds to the gw - approximation . </S>",
    "<S> after variation of @xmath12 over the gf , which we consider as a variational variable , one can obtain the usual gw expression for the self - energy : @xmath16where @xmath17 is the coulomb interaction and @xmath0 is the effective interaction @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to rotate the contour of integration in eq.([sgm ] ) in the complex plane , using the fact that @xmath19 has no singularities in the first and third quadrantsgalitsky , mahan , whereas @xmath14 has a singularity ( cut ) in the third quadrant for @xmath20 @xmath21 and in the first one for @xmath22 @xmath21 . in the case of the quasiparticle </S>",
    "<S> the singularities of the gf are simple poles . </S>",
    "<S> after rotation the only additional contribution comes from the cut of the gf ( fig 1e ) , and for @xmath20 @xmath21 this contribution is @xmath23where @xmath24 . for the term corresponding to the integration along the imaginary axis </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath25at @xmath26 @xmath27 and the pole term disappears . </S>",
    "<S> the term @xmath28 is usually negative in the heg model . on the real axis </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29 has an imaginary part , which is important for accurate calculations of @xmath30 in tm . </S>",
    "<S> the summation over * k * ( one - site approximation ) transforms all the above formulas into matrix equations on the local wave function basis , greatly reducing the computational efforts . </S>",
    "<S> the full on - site gf @xmath31 was obtained self - consistently from eq.([sgm ] ) . due to the large value of @xmath32 in tm </S>",
    "<S> , the final @xmath14 differs significantly from the initial @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath34 was also obtained self - consistently with the full @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss the choice of skeleton graphs for the lwf . according to perturbation theory with coulomb parameter @xmath35 the exchange diagram ( fig 1a ) gives the largest contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the set of empty bubble diagrams ( fig.1b ) gives the next term @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the summation of these terms is necessary to take into account the long - distance character of the coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the proper treatment of the  dressed   </S>",
    "<S> gf in  the bubble approximation must include vertex corrections@xcite ( fig.1b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the next term ( fig.1c ) is just the exchange diagram in the second - order approximation , which has an order of @xmath37 </S>",
    "<S> . it can be important in magnets , as the corresponding self - energy depends only on the gf with the same spin , while in bubble diagrams both spins are averaged . in principle , the fig.1c diagram is already included in the set , if the bubble diagrams with vertex corrections are considered . </S>",
    "<S> but it seems desirable to include also the ladder sequence of fig.1d , as it is also highly spin dependent . </S>",
    "<S> this set does not contain the first ( @xmath38 ) term@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a sum is reduced by the effective screening of the coulomb potential , which in turn strongly depends on the energy . </S>",
    "<S> the static value of the effective interaction is rather small , but it quickly increases as a function of energy ( fig.2b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluated this sum of lattice - type t - matrix diagrams ( fig.1d ) with the effective interaction replacing the energy dependent potential by the averaged static interaction @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath40 was chosen in such a way that the value of the diagrams on fig.1c obtained with both energy dependent and @xmath39 type of interactions were the same . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath40 turned out to be @xmath41 0.35 .    </S>",
    "<S> the diagrams discussed above are also the leading diagrams from the point of view of the one - site approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the number of d - electrons with various angular moment projections @xmath42 is approximately the same in both ni and fe . </S>",
    "<S> if we take into account that the main contribution in the coulomb interaction , expanded in spherical harmonics @xmath43 is from the term with @xmath44 , then , with this accuracy , @xmath42 is conserved and one can classify various diagrams with the parameter @xmath45 . for d electrons this is a small parameter and the main terms with @xmath46 are again flex diagrams@xcite . in summary , we believe , that the set of diagrams in fig.1 is the minimal set which must be included in the calculations . on the other hand , our calculations revealed that it can be sufficient for description of magnetic properties and electronic structure of 3d metals .    </S>",
    "<S> the rotation of the integration contour allows us to deal only with the states lying in the vicinity of @xmath21@xcite , as the po is smooth and decreases when i m @xmath47 is increased , contrary to its behavior on the real axis . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in fig.2a , b for ferromagnetic fe . </S>",
    "<S> for the states near @xmath21 we can use the gf constructed with low lying lmto states @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the corresponding solutions of equations@xmath51@xmath52with @xmath53 @xmath54 is the center of gravity of the band with orbital moment @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the eigenvectors of the generalized eigenvalue problem with the hamiltonian @xmath57which is a matrix in the space of lmto states @xmath58 , where @xmath59 are the usual lmto coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure takes into account the energy - independent exchange potential @xmath60 exactly .    </S>",
    "<S> the important problem in the nonlocal calculations is the inclusion of the valence - core interaction . in our method </S>",
    "<S> we included the core - valence exchange term exactly , whereas the core - valence correlation term was added using the approximation developed in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter term in tm such as fe , ni or cu is small . </S>",
    "<S> the set of eqs.([sch]),([dsch ] ) was solved iteratively@xcite . the integral equation for the screened interaction @xmath61 </S>",
    "<S> was solved using the product basis introduced in ref.@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the procedure above was applied to the 3d transition metals fe and ni . </S>",
    "<S> the main contribution to the self - energy comes from the exchange diagram ( fig 1a ) , but the pure exchange approximation produces too large a self - consistent magnetic moment @xmath62 ( @xmath63 3.05@xmath64 in fe ( see also ref.@xcite ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bubble diagrams screen the coulomb interaction , either too strongly ( @xmath63 1.95@xmath64 in fe ) or too weakly ( @xmath63 0.73@xmath64 in ni ) . </S>",
    "<S> vertex corrections only slightly modify this result , uniformly reducing the interaction for both spins . </S>",
    "<S> the conclusions in general agree with gw results for the heg@xcite , though the importance of the exchange t - matrix diagram ( fig 1d ) is rather intrinsic to tm@xcite . with all considered diagrams the calculated equilibrium magnetic moments ( 2.04@xmath64 in fe and 0.65@xmath64 in ni ) </S>",
    "<S> are close to lda values ( 2.15@xmath64 , 0.62@xmath64 ) and experimental values ( 2.08@xmath64 , 0.59@xmath64 ) .    the gf calculations naturally provide valuable information about the renormalization and damping of the electron spectra which are absent in lda . </S>",
    "<S> in fig.3 we present the energy dependence of the real ( @xmath65 ) and imaginary ( @xmath66 ) parts of the self - energy @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath68 is linear in a wide range of energies , supporting the concept of well - defined quasiparticles . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the renormalization factor @xmath69 strongly depends on the orbital number @xmath55 . for @xmath2 and @xmath70 electrons </S>",
    "<S> @xmath71 is about 0.96 and is in good agreement with the heg estimations ( @xmath72 @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> but for @xmath1 electrons this factor is about 0.6 in ni and 0.7 in fe , pointing out severe many - body effects . </S>",
    "<S> the value @xmath73 was calculated self - consistently and in ni it approximately coincides with the value calculated with a non - self - consistent ( using lda wave functions ) method@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> previous studies revealed that the most significant differences between the lda and experimental results are the satellite peak below the quasiparticle band ( approximately 6 - 8 ev below @xmath21 ) and  a larger value of the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level @xmath74 . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the overall experimental bandwidth ( 7 - 8 ev in fe and 6 - 7 ev in ni ) is larger than what is found in the lda along with the larger values of @xmath74 . extracted from the linear term in the heat capacity , the experimental dos values are 57 st / a.u . in fe and 81 st / a.u . in ni . </S>",
    "<S> though a considerable amount of this value can be ascribed to the electron - phonon interaction , they are still much larger than the ` bare ' lda values in fe ( 30 st / a.u . ) and in ni ( 48 st / a.u . ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the small value of @xmath73 obtained above leads to a narrowing of the quasiparticle band . </S>",
    "<S> the rest of the one - electron states take part in the formation of the satellite structure , which usually appears when the hole - hole interaction is taken into account@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently our dos ( fig.4 ) is also wider compared to the lda dos and has a bump below the quasiparticle dos . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the dos at the fermi level is even lower than in the lda , though the value of coefficient @xmath75 , which is @xmath76 times larger than the dos , is approximately the same as in lda . </S>",
    "<S> both values are still lower than the experimental values </S>",
    "<S> . it can be due to the high sensitivity of the stoner splitting in ferromagnets ( and in turn the value of @xmath74 ) to all the approximations used or possible narrowing of the hopping between neighboring sites in the spirit of the gutzwiller approximation or the dynamical mean field theory , which is omitted in our approximation .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have proposed a new self - consistent version of the gf approach , which uses the quasiparticle wave functions as a basis set . </S>",
    "<S> we found that self - consistent gw approach produces the leading contribution to the electronic structure and magnetic properties of tm , whereas the addition of fluctuating exchange diagrams overall slightly corrects this result improving comparison with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> while the self - consistent renormalization factors @xmath71 for @xmath2 and @xmath70 electrons in ni and fe are close to the estimations obtained from the heg , @xmath73 is much smaller ( 0.6 - 0.7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the values of bandwidth and density of states at the fermi level are in reasonable agreement with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed technique can be naturally used for total energy calculations . in summary </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the proposed technique can be considered as a practical _ ab - initio _ alternative to modern dft methods with much wider range of applicability .    </S>",
