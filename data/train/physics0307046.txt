    "during 1978 - 1986 a series of measurements were performed ( , 1987 and 1989 ) in order to verify the gravitational law in fluids as deduced by  ( 1984 ) . in 1978",
    "a disturbing phenomenon was observed in the measurements which compelled the author to use another method .    in a private communication between the authors , the new",
    "- then disturbing - phenomenon was discussed and a series of experiments focusing on this phenomenon were proposed . in the department of physics of pedagogical university at , the original experimental device was reconstructed with the purpose of creating the best conditions for the observation of the phenomenon ( see fig .  [ stroj ] ) .",
    "after objects immersed in the water have been at rest for one or several days , seven qualitatively different phenomena can be observed :    ( 1 ) : :    when the hanger is rotated by a certain angle , the plate immersed in    the water remains in almost the same position , in spite of the    twisting tension arising in the thin filament .",
    "( nevertheless , a    `` creep '' toward a new neutral position can be observed after some    time ( days or weeks ) . ) when a certain critical angle is reached , the    plate will rotate - relatively quickly - into a new neutral position    given by the angle of rotation of the hanger .",
    "( when a smooth - surfaced    cylinder , which can rotate around its own axis , was used instead of    the plate , this phenomenon was not observed . ) ( 2 ) : :    another phenomenon , though - in the clarity of appearance - weaker    than the phenomenon mentioned above , can simultaneously be observed : a    quick rotation of the plate in the direction of the rotation of the    hanger ; nevertheless , the angle of the quick rotation is one or two    orders of magnitude less than the angle in phenomenon ( 1 ) .    +    ( using a one generation older device , the strongly dampened    oscillations could be observed around the new equilibrium position    ( i.e. rest - position with twisting tension in the filament ) after the    mechanical pulse had been given to the plate .",
    "such oscillations were    directly observed by  in a very rough experiment performed in march    1991 ( not published ) and ( after a personal report ) discovered by  when    reanalyzing observational material from 1978 ) .",
    "( 3 ) : :    the critical angle of rotation in phenomenon ( 1 ) is dependent on the    period of time the water has been at rest .",
    "this angle increases with    time , starting from virtually zero .",
    "( the critical angle can reach    values of several tens of degrees ! ) ( 4 ) : :    if the plate is only partially immersed , the critical angle is    significantly greater than when it is immersed completely .",
    "( 5 ) : :    in case of partial immersion , the phenomenon analogous to ( 2 ) is much    more prominent .    +    ( both phenomena ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) are time - dependent as described in ( 3 )    despite the time - invariance of the surface tension which we also    tested . ) ( 6 ) : :    if the water is stirred after having been at rest for some time    ( several days ) , the critical angle increases from zero quicker ( when    being again at rest ) than when new `` fresh '' water is used . ( 7 ) : :    the critical angle is significantly augmented and the phenomenon    appears earlier if the ( distilled ) water is boiled ( thus deaerated )    before the experiment is started .    regarding the convincing prominence of observed phenomena , we consider them being significant enough in order to claim they are real , despite the performed experiments were only qualitative .",
    "( our attempts in carrying out quantitative experiments with an acceptable precision did not succeed , owing to too great dispersion of measured values ; much more professional laboratory equipment than the one we could acquire , as well as more strict measurement conditions than those we could guarantee , would be necessary . )    in accordance with the generally accepted terminology , the above described complex of phenomena could appropriately be called the _ autothixotropy _ of water .",
    "looking for a preliminary interpretation of our observations , a hypothesis based on `` ephemeric polymerisation '' of the water seems to be plausible .",
    "the existence of such a weak polymerisation was suspected decades ago , both defended and denied by experts .",
    "if the ephemeric polymerisation of water is the cause of the observed phenomena , it indicates that dipole water molecules are establishing chains or a network ; first as minute complexes , thereafter combining successively with one another .",
    "the structure then becomes more and more dense while oscillating at a certain amplitude on a scale of molecules .",
    "such a structure will be relatively fragile , susceptible perhaps even to differences in the concentration of materials dissolvable in water , at different points inside the vessel .",
    "the brownian motion can be observed in the case of a conglomerate of molecules having a non - polar character , owing to collisions with molecules of water oscillating in the established network .",
    "a stirring - not too thorough - of the `` old '' water seems to preserve parts of the network , making the subsequent `` dipole polymerisation '' quicker than it would be in the `` fresh '' ( i.e. well stirred ) water .",
    "further , the established structure has a certain degree of elasticity .",
    "if the water is deaerated by boiling , no dissolved air ( gases ) has a disturbing influence either on the developing process or integrity of the structures ; consequently , the phenomenon appears earlier and is more pronounced ."
