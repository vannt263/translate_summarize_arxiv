    "data from the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) on the collective flow of matter in nucleus - nucleus collisions have delivered a surprising result : the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath3 is sufficiently large @xcite to be compatible with calculations performed in the framework of _ ideal _ fluid dynamics @xcite .",
    "this has given rise to the notion that `` rhic physicists serve up the perfect liquid '' @xcite .",
    "of course , no real liquid can have zero viscosity : for all weakly coupled theories , i.e. , theories with well - defined quasi - particles , in the dilute limit there is a lower bound which one can derive from the uncertainty principle @xcite : the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density @xmath4 . for certain strongly coupled theories without quasiparticles ,",
    "there is also a lower bound which can be obtained from the ads / cft conjecture @xcite , @xmath5 , i.e. , surprisingly close to the bound for dilute , weakly coupled systems .    in order to see whether the shear viscosity of the hot and dense matter created in nuclear collisions at rhic is close to the lower bound",
    ", one has to perform calculations in the framework of relativistic _ dissipative _ fluid dynamics .",
    "this program has only been recently initiated , but has already led to an enormous activity in the literature @xcite .",
    "fluid dynamics is an effective theory for the long - wavelength , small - frequency modes of a given theory . in order to see this ,",
    "let us introduce three length scales : ( a ) a microscopic length scale , @xmath6 . in all theories , at sufficiently large temperatures",
    "this length scale can be defined as the thermal wavelength @xmath7 . in weakly coupled theories with well - defined quasi - particles ,",
    "this can be interpreted as the interparticle distance .",
    "( b ) a mesoscopic length scale , @xmath8 . in weakly coupled theories and in the dilute limit",
    ", this can be identified with the mean - free path of particles between collisions . in strongly coupled theories ,",
    "such a scale is not known and should be identified with @xmath6 .",
    "( c ) a macroscopic length scale , @xmath9 .",
    "this is the scale over which the conserved densities ( e.g.  the charge density , @xmath10 , or the energy density , @xmath11 ) of the theory vary .",
    "thus , @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath13 is proportional to the gradients of the conserved quantities .",
    "we now define the quantity @xmath14 . for dilute systems , this quantity is identical to the so - called knudsen number",
    ". if @xmath15 is sufficiently small , fluid dynamics as an effective theory can be derived in a controlled way as a power series in terms @xmath15 . since @xmath16 ,",
    "this series expansion is equivalent to a gradient expansion .",
    "to zeroth order in @xmath15 , one obtains the equations of ideal fluid dynamics . to first order in @xmath15 ,",
    "one obtains the navier - stokes ( ns ) equations .",
    "so - called second - order theories contain terms of second order in @xmath15 .",
    "examples for the latter are the burnett equations @xcite , the israel - stewart equations for relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics @xcite , the memory function theory @xcite , extended thermodynamics @xcite , and others @xcite .",
    "the main difference between first and second - order theories is the velocity of signal propagation .",
    "the relativistic ns equations allow for infinite signal propagation speeds and are therefore acausal . on the other hand ,",
    "all second - order theories are considered to be causal in the sense that all signal velocities are smaller than the speed of light , provided that the parameters of the theory are suitably chosen .",
    "the stability and causality of fluid - dynamical theories are usually studied around a hydrostatic state ( i.e. , for vanishing macroscopic flow velocity ) which is in thermodynamical equilibrium . however ,",
    "if a theory is stable around a hydrostatic state , it does not necessarily imply that it is stable in a state of nonzero flow velocity .",
    "following this idea , the stability and causality of first and second - order fluid dynamics for a state with nonzero background flow velocity ( mathematically realized by a lorentz boost ) were studied for the case of nonzero bulk viscosity , but for vanishing shear stress and heat flow in ref .",
    "there it was found that causality and stability are intimately related : for all parameters considered , the theory becomes unstable if and only if there is a mode which propagates faster than the speed of light .    in this paper",
    ", we extend this analysis to the case of nonvanishing shear viscosity in second - order theories of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics .",
    "a similar analysis for a hydrostatic background has already been done by hiscock , lindblom , and olson @xcite , but they discussed exclusively the low- and high - wavenumber limits @xcite .",
    "as we shall show in this paper , their analysis missed a divergence of the group velocity of a shear mode at intermediate wavenumbers .",
    "this anomalous behavior is generic , i.e. , it can not be removed by tuning the parameters of the theory , e.g. , the relaxation time for the shear stress tensor , @xmath0 , and the shear viscosity , @xmath17 . however ,",
    "if the ratio @xmath2 , where @xmath18 $ ] is the sound attenuation length in @xmath19 space - time dimensions , is chosen such that the large - momentum limit of the group velocity associated with the perturbation remains below the velocity of light ( the so - called asymptotic causality condition ) , one can ensure that the divergence is restricted to a finite range of momenta .",
    "it will be demonstrated that in this case , the causality of the theory is not compromised . on the other hand , second - order fluid dynamics",
    "is always stable in the rest frame of the fluid , even if we use a parameter set which violates the asymptotic causality condition .",
    "we also study the causality and stability for a state with nonzero background flow velocity , i.e. , in a lorentz - boosted frame .",
    "we find that the divergence of the group velocity is removed .",
    "however , depending on the boost velocity the group velocity of either the shear or the sound mode may still exceed the speed of light in a certain range of wavenumbers .",
    "nevertheless , provided that the ratio @xmath2 fulfills the asymptotic causality condition , we can show that the equations are stable .",
    "in contrast to the analysis in the rest frame , however , they become unstable if the asymptotic causality condition is violated .",
    "we shall demonstrate that if the asymptotic causality condition is fulfilled , the causality of the theory as a whole is not compromised . in this sense , causality and stability",
    "are intimately related .",
    "so far , the discussion was limited to the fluid - dynamical equations in the linear approximation .",
    "therefore , we expect the results to be valid for all versions of second - order theories presently discussed in the literature , since they differ only by nonlinear terms .",
    "we also compute the characteristic velocities for the so - called simplified is equations @xcite without linearizing these equations .",
    "our analysis strongly indicates that the characteristic velocities remain below the velocity of light if the ratio @xmath2 is chosen such that the asymptotic causality condition is fulfilled .",
    "the asymptotic causality condition implies that , for a given @xmath20 , @xmath0 must not be arbitrarily small .",
    "this explains why relativistic ns theory is acausal , because there @xmath21 , while @xmath17 is non - zero .",
    "it also implies that second - order theories are not _ per se _ causal ; they can violate causality ( and become unstable ) if a too small value for @xmath0 is chosen .",
    "the statement that second - order theories automatically cure the shortcomings of ns theory is therefore not true .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ii ] , we discuss the causality and stability of the linearized second - order fluid - dynamical equations in the local rest frame .",

    "[ iii ] , this discussion is generalized to a lorentz - boosted frame .",
    "we discuss lorentz boosts both in and orthogonal to the direction of propagation of the perturbation .",
    "it will be demonstrated that superluminal group velocities will not compromise the causality of the theory as long as the asymptotic causality condition is fulfilled . in sec .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , there are several approaches to formulate a second - order theory of relativistic dissipative fluids @xcite .",
    "these approaches differ only by nonlinear ( second - order ) terms .",
    "however , since we shall apply a linear stability analysis in the following , these differences vanish and all approaches lead to the same set of linearized fluid - dynamical equations . in this work , we do not consider any conserved charges and thus are left with energy - momentum conservation , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the energy - momentum tensor . here , @xmath11 and @xmath26 are the energy density and the pressure , while @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the fluid velocity , the bulk viscous pressure , and the shear stress tensor , respectively .",

    "we compute in the landau frame @xcite , where there is no energy flow in the local rest frame .    in second - order theories of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics ,",
    "the bulk viscous pressure and the shear stress tensor are determined from evolution equations . in @xmath19 space - time dimensions ( @xmath32 ) , these equations are given by    [ eqofmotion ] @xmath33    possible other second - order terms @xcite can be neglected for the purpose of a linear stability analysis . in eqs .",

    "the stability and causality of a relativistic dissipative fluid with bulk viscous pressure only have been investigated in ref .",
    "thus , for the sake of simplicity , we shall first ignore the effects from bulk viscous pressure and discuss the properties of the fluid - dynamical equations of motion including only shear viscosity .",

    "so far , we have analyzed the causality and stability of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics with shear viscosity using a linear stability analysis .",
    "however , there is another possibility to analyze causality , namely by studying the characteristic velocities . for the sake of simplicity",

    "the fluid - dynamical equations can be written in the following form : @xmath194 where @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",

    "[ fig10 ] , we show the @xmath91 dependence of one of the five characteristic velocities .",

    "this divergence occurs also for at least one other characteristic velocity .",
    "as far as we have checked numerically , in order to satisfy causality , one should use a value of @xmath91 which is larger than about 2 .",

    "in this work , we have discussed the stability and causality of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics , based on a linear stability analysis around a hydrostatic state . following the usual argument , we calculated the group velocity from the dispersion relation of the perturbation .",
    "we found that the group velocity diverges at a critical wavenumber @xmath107 .",
    "the appearance of the divergence is independent of the dimensionality of space - time and can be removed neither by tuning the parameters of the theory nor by adding bulk viscosity to the discussion .",
    "nevertheless , in the rest frame of the background this acausal group velocity does not cause the fluid to become unstable .",
    "moreover , investigating causality and stability in a lorentz - boosted frame , we found that the fluid - dynamical equations of motion are stable , if we choose parameters which satisfy a so - called asymptotic causality condition .",
    "they become unstable if this condition is violated . in this sense , the problems of acausality and instability are still correlated even in the case of shear viscosity , as was already found for the case of bulk viscosity @xcite .",
    "we have then demonstrated that the causality of the theory as a whole is guaranteed if the asymptotic causality condition is fulfilled .",
    "therefore , a superluminal group velocity in a finite range of momenta can cause the theory neither to become acausal nor unstable .",
    "finally , we studied the characteristic velocities and found a violation of causality for small values of @xmath205 , but not for values which satisfy the asymptotic causality condition .",
    "the asymptotic causality condition requires that the ratio @xmath2 is sufficiently large , i.e. , that the time scale @xmath0 over which the shear viscous pressure relaxes towards its ns value is not too small compared to the sound attenuation length @xmath206 .",
    "this is an important finding for practitioners of fluid dynamics , who frequently consider @xmath0 and the shear viscosity - to - entropy density ratio @xmath207 to be independent from each other .",
    "we have demonstrated that this is not the case if one wants the theory to remain causal .",
    "therefore , second - order theories of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics are not automatically causal by construction .",

    "<S> we investigate the causality and stability of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics in the absence of conserved charges . we perform a linear stability analysis in the rest frame of the fluid and find that the equations of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics are always stable . </S>",
    "<S> we then perform a linear stability analysis in a lorentz - boosted frame . </S>",
    "<S> provided that the ratio of the relaxation time for the shear stress tensor , @xmath0 , to the sound attenuation length , @xmath1 , fulfills a certain asymptotic causality condition , the equations of motion give rise to stable solutions . </S>",
    "<S> although the group velocity associated with perturbations may exceed the velocity of light in a certain finite range of wavenumbers , we demonstrate that this does not violate causality , as long as the asymptotic causality condition is fulfilled . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compute the characteristic velocities and show that they remain below the velocity of light if the ratio @xmath2 fulfills the asymptotic causality condition . </S>"
