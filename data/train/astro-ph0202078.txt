    "the unprecedented sensitivity and excellent imaging capabilities of xmm - newton and chandra observatories provide an accurate and fascinating view of the whole population of cosmic x - ray sources , allowing to investigate a very large , and previously unexplored , parameters space .    recent deep observations with chandra ( tozzi et al . 2001 ; brandt et al . 2001 ; mushotzky et al . 2000 ) and xmm - newton ( hasinger et al . 2001 ) in the range between 0.1 to 10 kev have in fact definitively probed that the bulk of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) is due to the emission of discrete sources along the cosmic time .",
    "such deep surveys allowed to reach extremely low flux levels ( @xmath66 @xmath0 10@xmath7 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 and @xmath65 @xmath0 10@xmath8 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 between 0.5 - 2 kev and 2 - 10 kev , respectively ) and to resolve @xmath680 - 90% of the cxb below 10 kev .",
    "multiwavelength follow - up observations of these x - ray surveys indicate that the majority of the x - ray sources are associated with active galactic nuclei ( agns ) while the remaining ones are bright early - type galaxies or optically faint ( @xmath9 24 ) objects ( likely obscured agns ) .",
    "current cxb synthesis models ( madau , ghisellini & fabian 1994 ; comastri et al .",
    "1995 ) are based on a mixture of type 1 ( unabsorbed ) and type 2 ( absorbed ) objects .",
    "they predict the presence of a substantial number of high luminosities ( log@xmath10 44 erg s@xmath3 ) heavily obscured ( log@xmath11 23 @xmath2 ) sources , but only a handful of convincing cases of pure reflection type 2 qsos have been discovered so far ( see i.e. norman et al .",
    "2001 ; franceschini et al .",
    "moreover recent works reveal the existence of previously undetected intriguing sources , most of which are x - ray faint , i.e. broad line agns which suffer from intrinsic x - ray absorption ( maloney & reynolds 2001 ; fiore et al . 2001 ; wilkes et al . 2001 ) and x - ray loud optically quiet galaxies ( fiore et al . 2000 ; allen , di matteo & fabian 2000 ) .",
    "these objects show intrinsic flat x - ray slopes which match well with the cxb one ( @xmath12 = 1.4 , vecchi et al .",
    "1999 ) so that they could be significant in explaining the flat spectral shape of the cxb .",
    "so far , howewer , very few broadband spectra of x - ray sources with @xmath13 10@xmath14 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 have been published in the literature and their properties ( i.e. spectral index , absorption column density and strenght of features due to reprocessing ) have been poorly investigated .",
    "+ such detailed spectral information are now accessible for the first time with few tens kilosecond observations of the epic detector on - board the xmm - newton satellite .",
    "we have thus started an extensive program aimed at performing an accurate spectroscopic analysis of hard x - ray ( 2 - 10 kev ) selected serendipitous sources in a large number of epic fields .",
    "we have chosen epic because of its unprecedented high sensitivity in the hard x - ray band and of its arcseconds positional accuracy both of which are crucial to carry out such kind of study .",
    "here we report spectral results of a sample of 39 sources observed in a total of seven public epic fields during the performance verification phase of xmm - newton .",
    "these sources have been detected with a 5@xmath15 significance in the 2 - 10 kev band using _ eboxdetect _ , the standard sliding cells algorithm of the _ sas _ software package .",
    "the measured @xmath16 range from 3 to 80 @xmath0 10@xmath1 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 with @xmath17 60% of the objects showing a @xmath18 10@xmath14 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 .",
    "23 out of 39 sources in the sample have optical identification : 13 are from the literature and the remaining 10 are from the hellas2xmm survey ( fiore et al .",
    "2002 , in preparation ) .",
    "identification of the remaining sources is being planned too .",
    "all these sources have @xmath19 0.1 , except for the nearby normal galaxy ngc 4291 at @xmath5 = 0.0058 .",
    "the redshift distribution over the entire sample is shown in figure  [ epiconcelli - f11_fig : fig1 ] .",
    "16 x - ray sources are optically classified as broad line quasars , three are normal galaxies , two are narrow emission line galaxies , one is a seyfert 2 galaxy and , finally , one is a red quasar .",
    "we also cross - correlate our sample with the most popular radio catalogues ( nvss and first ) available on - line : we find that three x - ray sources have radio counterpart , however these radio surveys do not cover the whole sky , so this result is not complete . as an example",
    ", the mos1 image of the x - ray source xmmu j000100.0 - 250459 with the superimposed radio contours of nvss j000100 - 250503 is shown in figure  [ epiconcelli - f11_fig : fig2 ] combining optical and radio information we infer that these three sources are all radio loud ( rl ) agns .",
    "to date the analysis of epic spectra of all our sources is still not complete hence here we report preliminar results of this work . the final and more detailed description of our study will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( piconcelli et al .",
    "2002 , in preparation ) .",
    "we start to fit the spectra with a single power law modified by the galactic column density ( model a ) in order to describe the general form of the continuum and to find the deviations from the model , indicative of the presence of extra features and absorption . in figure",
    "[ epiconcelli - f11_fig : fig3 ] we show the results of this spectral fitting . the photon spectral indeces span from 0.1 to 2.8 , but most of them cluster around 1.8 - 2.0 e.g. the typical values found for broad line unabsorbed agns ( as are the majority of the optically identified sources in the sample ) .",
    "applying this model we find an average spectral index @xmath20 = 1.71@xmath210.04 . if we consider only the 19 sources with @xmath22 7 @xmath0 10@xmath1 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 ( i.e. our completeness flux limit ) we obtain a @xmath20 = 1.68@xmath210.04 .",
    "this value is steeper than that found by @xcite and della ceca et al .",
    "( 1999 ) on the basis of stacked spectral analysis of asca sources at a similar flux limit . on the other hand it matches well with the results obtained from a 130 ks chandra observation of the chandra deep field south reported by giacconi et al .",
    "these authors found , in fact , @xmath20 = 1.71@xmath210.07 again from a stacked spectrum analysis of sources brighter than @xmath62 @xmath0 10@xmath1 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 .",
    "it is worth noting that flat slopes ( @xmath12 = 1.0 - 1.2 ) are present in any case ; this is probably indicative of a high column density which obscures the x - ray emission ( absorption cross - section @xmath23 @xmath24 ) .",
    "viceversa a very steep spectral index could mask a soft excess component .",
    "we therefore also apply more detailed fitting models to those sources showing a complex spectrum and for which model a does not give a satisfactory @xmath25 .",
    "we find that 9 out of 39 sources require an additional extra absorption component .",
    "in all these cases we find @xmath26 in the range of 10@xmath27 @xmath2 except for the seyfert 2 galaxy xmmu j030911.9@xmath28765824 , for which we obtain @xmath29 10@xmath30 @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly enough , two out of three radio loud objects have an absorption column density in excess to the galactic value .",
    "this fact was already found in other x - ray observations of rl agns ( @xcite ; sambruna , eracleous & mushotzky 1999 ) and could have relevant implications about the cosmic evolution of this class of objects .",
    "furthermore the two optically dull x - ray loud galaxies ( i.e. objects with no sign of nuclear activity but with unusual log@xmath31 42 erg s@xmath3 ) present in our sample are x - ray obscured .    a soft excess component is required at @xmath32 95% confidence in 4 sources .",
    "the origin of these upturns in the soft portion of the spectrum appears not to be of the same kind in all sources : in one case ( the seyfert 2 galaxy ) we parameterize this excess with a power law model as expected for a scattered component , while in the remaining ones a thermal model ( i.e. blackbody or raymond - smith model ) provides a better fit .",
    "finally we have also checked in each source for the possible presence of an emission lines ( i.e. those from iron , expected at 6.4 - 6.9 kev rest - frame ) .",
    "we found no significant detection , with typical upper limits on the equivalent width of @xmath4 350 ev",
    "the present program will continue as new epic fields become public .",
    "we will also use the observations discussed in cappi et al . and foschini et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) to increase our sample .",
    "we thank the hellas2xmm team for the optical identifications .",
    "thanks matteo guainazzi , andrea de luca and alessandro baldi for helpful discussions on data reduction procedures . e.p . gratefully acknowledges the support from murst for the program of promotion for young scientists p.g.r.99 .",
    "this research has also made use of the simbad database , operated by the centre de donnees astronomiques de strasbourg ( cds ) ."
