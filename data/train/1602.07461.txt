    "going beyond the harmonic approximation in theoretical vibrational spectroscopy is an important step , as it gives access to chemically accurate spectroscopic and thermochemical data . with some effort , for small - to - medium size molecules a quantitative agreement with experimental results",
    "can be achieved @xcite .",
    "there are two major well - established approaches for calculations of anharmonic vibrational spectra , vibrational perturbation theory ( vpt ) and variational methods . in the first one ,",
    "the anharmonicity is treated as a perturbation of the zeroth - order solution obtained in the harmonic approximation @xcite . in the latter approach ,",
    "on which we will focus here , the nuclear schrdinger equation is solved in a variational manner , analogously to electronic structure methods .",
    "most prominent starting - point is the vibrational self - consistent field ( vscf ) method , on top of which the lacking vibrational correlation energy is approximated by methods such as vibrational configuration interaction ( vci ) or ( non - variational ) vibrational coupled cluster ( vcc ) theory @xcite .    however , all available approaches are feasible only for relatively small molecules .",
    "the first bottleneck lies in constructing the anharmonic potential energy surface ( pes ) .",
    "mapping the full pes directly for all vibrational coordinates is achievable only for molecules consisting of few atoms , as the number of required grid points grows exponentially with the number of nuclei . in vpt , the pes",
    "is thus approximated by a taylor expansion of the energy at the equilibrium geometry , which is usually truncated at third or fourth order .",
    "on the other hand , variational methods usually employ a truncated @xmath0-mode expansion @xcite of the pes , in which the potential energy is expanded discretely on a grid .",
    "an accurate approximation of the pes requires the inclusion of higher - order terms in the @xmath0-mode expansion .",
    "the main hindrance in the @xmath0-mode expansion is the need for the calculation of coupling terms , i.e. , of two - mode , three - mode , or even higher - order potentials .",
    "several methods have been developed to speed up the construction of the pes and in order to make anharmonic vibrational calculations feasible also for larger systems .",
    "for some combinations of modes , the couplings will be relatively small , which could be prescreened without a significant loss of accuracy @xcite .",
    "another possibility to tackle the computational cost of obtaining the higher - order terms in the pes expansion are multi - level or hybrid approaches @xcite , in which electronic - structure methods of different levels are applied to the different terms of the pes expansion . in the spirit of an hierarchical expansion ,",
    "the most dominant one - mode terms are treated with high - level electronic - structure methods , such as coupled - cluster theory , whereas for the two - mode or higher - order terms less accurate but more efficient methods , such as density - functional theory , are employed .",
    "since vscf describes the interaction of modes only in a mean - field manner , post - vscf methods such as vci @xcite have to be applied to recover the vibrational correlation energy .",
    "here , the main computational bottleneck arises from the construction of the vci - hamiltonian matrix .",
    "its size depends on the expansion of the vci space",
    ". converged vci energies require rather large excitation spaces , which again limits the applicability of the method to small molecules .",
    "this problem is addressed with several configuration selection methods , where only the mostly contributing states are included in the vci expansion , vastly reducing the size of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "thus , in general there are three main aspects that need to be addressed to make anharmonic vibrational calculations feasible for larger molecules : ( i ) the convergence of the @xmath0-mode expansion and therein ( ii ) the possibility to neglect or approximate some of the couplings between modes , and ( iii ) the convergence of the expansion of the excitation space in the post - vscf treatment , namely the vci space .",
    "the choice of coordinates , in which the calculations are performed , will affect all three of these aspects . here",
    ", we will explore to what extent a suitable choice of the coordinates can be beneficial for anharmonic vibrational calculations . in the present study , we will focus on rectilinear coordinates .",
    "curvilinear coordinates , though more natural , imply a more complicated form of the kinetic energy operator , which in turn makes the solution of the vibrational schrdinger equation more demanding @xcite .",
    "normal - modes coordinates , obtained in the harmonic approximation , are the most common choice for anharmonic vibrational calculations .",
    "unfortunately , in the anharmonic regime they provide a complicated picture of strong couplings between the normal modes .",
    "this results in a slow convergence , both with respect to the @xmath0-mode expansion of the pes , and with respect to the vci - expansion of the excitation space .",
    "one way of defining more appropriate coordinates are so - called local modes @xcite .",
    "they arise from the assumption that x  h stretching vibrations , instead of being collective motions of many x  h groups should rather be a set of coupled single - bond stretching motions , and such strictly local vibrational coordinates are thus constructed .",
    "such local modes were successfully applied to o ",
    "h stretching vibrations of water clusters and alcohols , giving access to overtone spectroscopy @xcite . a special case of local modes is the local monomer model ( lmon ) presented by bowman and coworkers @xcite . the falcon scheme by knig _",
    "et al . _ constructs strictly local vibrational coordinates in a similar spirit @xcite .",
    "another approach are optimized coordinates , which are obtained from a transformation of the normal modes coordinates during the vscf procedure to minimize the vscf energy @xcite .",
    "yagi and coworkers introduced optimized - coordinate variants of vscf , vci , and vcc and showed that in the new basis a faster convergence with respect to the excitation space is observed.@xcite these coordinates were also employed in a post - vscf perturbative treatment @xcite .",
    "it was noticed that the optimization procedure can provide coordinates that are well localized , and thus mutually decoupled .",
    "however , in this framework a full quartic force field is used and transformed during the optimization , which precludes computational savings in the construction of the pes .",
    "the locality of the coordinates can also be enforced during a transformation of normal modes coordinates .",
    "such rigorously defined localized modes have been introduced for the analysis and interpretation of selected bands of vibrational spectra of large molcules @xcite .",
    "we have previously developed localized - modes variants of vscf and vci , termed and , respectively @xcite . for selected vibrations of water clusters and polypeptides",
    ", we could show that localized - mode coordinates lead to an organized picture of the couplings between the localized modes , allowing for neglecting some of the coupling potentials _ a priori _ , without a loss in accuracy .",
    "moreover , a faster convergence within the vci excitation space was observed .",
    "cheng and steele applied such localized - modes coordinates only in the vscf framework , and explored using distance - based criteria for neglecting two - mode couplings @xcite .",
    "hanson - heine investigated the harmonic couplings arising from the localization procedure , and proposed their utilization as a post - vscf correlation correction in the ( hc ) method @xcite .",
    "recently , christiansen and co - workers proposed hybrid optimized / localized vibrational coordinates , where both the energy and spatial localization conditions are applied in the vscf procedure @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the use of localized modes in the / framework for calculations of the full anharmonic vibrational spectra ( i.e. , of all fundamental vibrations ) for small molecules . with these coordinates ,",
    "we assess their benefits with respect to the main bottlenecks of such computations , the convergence of the @xmath0-mode expansion and the possibility to neglect its small contributions _ a priori _ , as well as the convergence of the vci expansion with respect to the excitation space .",
    "this work is organized as follows : first , we recall and introduce the main aspects of the theory , concerning the @xmath0-mode expansion ( section  [ sec : n - mode ] ) , the localization of normal modes ( section  [ sec : localization ] ) , and the l - vcsf and methods ( section  [ sec : lvscf_lvci ] ) .",
    "subsequently , the computational details are described in section  [ sec : comp ] .",
    "next , we apply these methods to perform anharmonic vibrational calculations for ethene in section  [ sec : ethene ] and for furan in section  [ sec : furan ] . with high - level anharmonic potential energy surfaces for these two test cases ,",
    "we investigate the mutual couplings of normal and localized modes , respectively ( sections  [ sec : ethene_harmonic ] and  [ sec : furan_harmonic ] ) , the convergence with respect to the vci excitation space ( section  [ sec : ethene_vci ] ) and the convergence of the @xmath0-mode expansion ( sections  [ sec : ethene_nmode_ch - str ] , [ sec : ethene_nmode_all ] , and  [ sec : furan_potentials ] ) .",
    "our best - estimate ( l-)vci fundamental energies are compared to experimental reference data ( sections  [ sec : ethene_nmode_all ] and  [ sec : furan_potentials ] ) . at this point",
    ", we also explore simplified models to reduce the computational cost without a significant loss of accuracy .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the potential energy surface in our calculations is approximated by the hierarchical expansion @xcite , i.e. , @xmath1 with @xmath2 being @xmath3 rectilinear coordinates , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass - weighted cartesian @xmath6-coordinate ( @xmath7 ) of nucleus @xmath8 and where @xmath9 the coefficients @xmath10 can be chosen as the normal - mode vectors obtained in the harmonic approximation , or as localized modes @xmath11 obtained via a transformation of the normal modes . here and in the following the tilde denotes quantities referring to localized modes .",
    "details will be discussed in section  [ sec : localization ] .    to make the calculation of the pes feasible , the @xmath0-mode expansion is truncated at a certain order .",
    "it should be stressed that the pes in a truncated @xmath0-mode expansion is not invariant upon transformation of the modes , and thus the pes in localized - mode coordinates is not equivalent to the pes in normal - mode coordinates .",
    "therefore , the pes in different coordinates have to be constructed separately . consequently",
    ", the vibrational frequencies obtained with a truncated @xmath0-mode expansion in normal - mode coordinates and in localized - mode coordinates , respectively , will not be identical . this difference will , however , vanish when the @xmath0-mode expansion is fully converged .",
    "in contrast , a truncated taylor expansion of the pes can be easily transformed to a representation in other rectilinear modes ( for details , see appendix  a of ref  @xcite ) .",
    "here we recall only the crucial aspects of the method of normal modes localization , for further details see ref .",
    "we begin with the normal modes @xmath12 obtained as eigenvectors of the mass - weighted molecular hessian @xmath13 , @xmath14 with corresponding eigenvalues ( i.e. , squared vibrational frequencies ) @xmath15 .",
    "the corresponding normal - mode coordinates are then defined by eq .",
    "[ eq : norm_coord ] .",
    "to arrive at localized modes , the normal modes are transformed with a unitary transformation @xmath16 , @xmath17 such that @xmath16 maximizes the localization measure @xmath18 . here",
    ", we apply the atomic - contribution criterion defined as @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 corresponds to the contribution of nucleus @xmath21 to the normal mode @xmath22 defined as @xmath23 when localizing the normal modes , the hessian in the basis of the localized modes , @xmath24 is no longer diagonal and the localized modes are not the eigenvectors of the molecular hessian .",
    "commonly , the localization of the normal modes is performed for subsets of normal modes . to this end",
    ", the matrix @xmath12 is divided into column vectors which are assigned to @xmath25 subsets such that @xmath26 this leads to @xmath25 distinct subsets of localized modes @xmath27 .",
    "the resulting hessian in the basis of these subset - localized modes is a block - diagonal matrix , containing a non - zero block @xmath28 for each subset of localized modes along its diagonal .",
    "different strategies can be used for assigning normal modes to subset in the localization procedure .",
    "the character of normal modes ( i.e. , bending , stretching etc . ) can be used to decide which modes should be localized together .",
    "furthermore , the frequencies of normal modes can be taken into account , and thus modes lying in a given region of the spectrum are grouped and localized together .",
    "previously @xcite , such criteria have been used to guide a normal mode assignment .",
    "we employ such criteria here for localizing the normal modes in subsets containing similar vibrations .",
    "we are aiming to solve the vibrational schrdinger equation with the watson hamiltonian for a non - rotating molecule @xcite , @xmath29 where the first term corresponds to the vibrational angular momentum ( vam ) , and the second is so - called watson correction term , both together are often referred as vam terms . here",
    ", @xmath30 is the inverse moment of the inertia tensor , and @xmath31 is the momentum operator .",
    "since the exact evaluation of the vam terms is cumbersome several approximations are commonly introduced , such as a hierarchical expansion of the @xmath30 tensor , or a selective inclusion of the terms in the vci calculations in combination with prescreening techniques @xcite . as the vam terms depend on the inverse of the inertia tensor , their contribution will decrease with increasing size of the molecule .",
    "thus , for simplicity and efficiency , they are often omitted entirely , as we proceed here , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is expressed as a truncated @xmath0-mode expansion in either the normal - mode coordinates @xmath2 or localized - mode coordinates @xmath34 .    for the approximate solution of the vibrational schrdinger equation , the vscf and vci methods in normal - mode coordinates",
    "are well established @xcite .",
    "recently , we have introduced the analogous localized - mode variants and @xcite . here",
    ", we briefly recall the essential steps .    the vibrational wavefunction in is given by the product ansatz , @xmath35 here",
    ", @xmath36 is a so - called modal for the @xmath21-th localized mode @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the vibrational quantum number for this modal . applying the variational principle to the nuclear schrdinger equation ,",
    "a set of one - mode equations is obtained , @xmath39 with the effective hamiltonian , @xmath40 containing an effective mean - field potential , @xmath41 the resulting eigenvalue equations are then solved in a self - consistent manner to obtain the modal energies @xmath42 as well as the optimized modals @xmath36 themselves .",
    "the correlation energy is then treated using ( l-)vci.@xcite in this method , a total wavefunction for a considered vibrational state is built as a linear combination of @xmath43 basis states , @xmath44 the functions @xmath45 are products of the ground - state optimized modals @xmath46 . applying the variational principle with the ansatz of eq",
    ".   leads to a ci eigenvalue equation with the ci - matrix , @xmath47 its eigenvalues and eigenvectors are the requested energies and wavefunction coefficients , respectively .",
    "the ci expansion in eq .   is limited to a given order of excitation .",
    "the inclusion of higher excitations leads towards the limit of the full vci ( fvci ) , where all possible excitations are considered , but simultaneously increases the computational effort to construct and diagonalize the ci - matrix .",
    "there are several ways of constructing the excitation space in vci calculations .",
    "christiansen proposed the most straightforward definition , denoted as vci[@xmath0 ] , where for each of the @xmath3 modals , excitations up to the @xmath0-th excited state are allowed @xcite .",
    "such a definition yields a rather large excitation space , and thus further limitations are introduced .",
    "rauhut defines the number of simultaneously excited modals by analogy to electronic structure calculations giving vci - s , vci - sd , vci - sdt , ",
    ", where up to one , two , and three modals are excited , respectively @xcite",
    ". additionally , two parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be defined , limiting the maximal excitation per modal and the total sum of excitation quanta , respectively . here",
    ", we equate the three parameters introduced by rauhut .",
    "thus , in our nomenclature vci - sdtq corresponds to a vci space where up to four mode are excited simultaneously with up to four excitation quanta , @xmath51 .",
    "_ reported that such a definition , denoted by them as vci-(@xmath52 ) , is rational for vci in the basis of optimized modals @xcite .    in our calculations ,",
    "the excitation space is constructed from a single vscf reference , which was optimized for the vibrational ground state .",
    "this approach is referred to as ground - state vci ( gs - vci ) .",
    "another possibility is to use a different vscf reference for each state of interest , which was optimized in this particular state , denoted state - specific vci ( ss - vci ) .",
    "such calculations should usually provide a faster convergence with respect to the excitation space @xcite .",
    "however , it requires more computational effort , and yields non - orthogonal vci wave functions .",
    "for ethene and furan we have used the normal modes , harmonic frequencies and anharmonic potential energy surfaces in terms of normal - mode coordinates available in the on - line database of potential energy surfaces maintained by rauhut and co - workers @xcite .",
    "these harmonic and anharmonic potential energy surfaces were constructed by means of highly accurate explicitly correlated ccsd(t)-f12x methods @xcite .",
    "namely , the ccsd(t)-f12b method with a cc - pvtz - f12 basis set was used to obtain the hessian and the anharmonic one - mode potentials , whereas ccsd(t)-f12a with a cc - pvdz - f12 basis set was used for the anharmonic two - mode and higher - order potentials @xcite . for constructing anharmonic potential energy surfaces in terms of localized modes",
    ", we have localized the ccsd(t)-f12b / cc - pvtz - f12 normal modes using our locvib package @xcite .",
    "subsequently , we used the same methods as rauhut and co - workers to calculate the one - mode as well as ( for ethene ) the two - mode and three - mode potentials in terms of localized - mode coordinates with the molpro 2012.1 program package @xcite .    to investigate the vci convergence with respect to the @xmath0-mode expansion of the pes for the four highest modes of ethene ( see section  [ sec : ethene_nmode_ch - str ] ) , both for normal and localized modes , up to four - mode anharmonic potentials",

    "we use a hybrid pes in terms of both normal - mode and localized - mode coordinates . here",

    "to explore the advantages of / over a conventional vscf / vci treatment , we consider the ethene molecule as a first test case .",

    "note that in terms of localized - mode coordinates , such a hybrid pes can provide results that are as accurate as the full cc pes including three - mode potentials expanded in normal - mode coordinates .    as a further approximation ,",
    "the off - diagonal elements of hessian in the basis of localized modes are used to calculate harmonic two - mode potentials .",
    "these can be used to replace the full anharmonic two - mode potential for the modes belonging to the same subset in the localization .",
    "this simplified hybrid pes is denoted as @xmath60 .",
    "this way , 32 two - mode potentials ( corresponding to 8192 single - point calculations ) can be omitted .",
    "such an approximation results in an mad of the fundamental frequencies of 6 @xmath53  and a maximum deviation of 14 @xmath53 which is identical to the accuracy obtained when included all dft two - mode potentials .    finally , as a low - cost approximation",
    "we use only the harmonic two - mode potentials along with anharmonic one - mode potentials , both expanded in localized - mode coordinates , which requires only 336 single - point ccsd(t)-f12b / cc - pvtz - f12 calculations .",
    "this pes is denoted as @xmath61 .",
    "this computationally very cheap approach results in an mad of 40  @xmath53 , and a maximal deviation of 114  @xmath53 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the c ",
    "h stretching vibrations are very well reproduced and are only about 14  @xmath53  off from the experimental values .",
    "this is a closer agreement than for the full @xmath58 pes expanded in normal - mode coordinates .",
    "if normal - mode coordinates are used , we can obtain the anharmonic one - mode potentials ( @xmath62 ) with the same computational effort . as in the ethene example , this results in rather large discrepancies for the c  h stretching modes , whereas for the other vibrations , the deviations are at the similar as for localized modes .",
    "all in all , the mad raises to 53  @xmath53 , and the maximal deviation to 162  @xmath53  when applying this low - cost approximation with normal - mode coordinates instead of localized - mode coordinates .    in summary , for furan similar trends as in the ethene example are observed .",
    "in particular , for the modes that can be well localized , such as the c ",
    "h stretching and ( to a smaller extent ) bending vibrations , the convergence of the @xmath0-mode expansion is significantly faster in localized - mode coordinates .",
    "this makes it possible to employ computationally cheaper hybrid potential energy surfaces",
    ". if localized - mode coordinates are used , a hybrid @xmath59 yields fundamental vibrational frequencies of the same accuracy as a @xmath58 expanded in normal - mode coordinates .",
    "moreover , in localized - mode coordinates it becomes possible to neglect some of the two - mode potentials by replacing them with the harmonic counterparts arising from the localization without loss of accuracy .",
    "finally , localized - mode coordinates are better suited for devising low - cost approximations that require only the calculation of anharmonic one - mode potentials and that can provide a first approximation of anharmonic corrections .",
    "in this paper , we have presented l - vscf / l - vci calculations performed for all fundamental vibrations in two prototypical small molecules , ethene and furan .",
    "we have investigated to what extent employing localized - mode coordinates instead of the conventionally used normal - mode coordinates can be beneficial with respect to the main bottlenecks of such anharmonic vibrational calculations .",
    "concerning the convergence of the @xmath0-mode expansion , we observe a significantly faster convergence in localized - mode coordinates . while for ethene",
    ", the inclusion of up to four mode potentials is required to reduce the mean average deviation from the experimental fundamental frequencies below 10  @xmath53  when using normal - mode coordinates , with localized - mode coordinates the same level of accuracy can already be reached with only up to three - mode potentials . similarly , for furan",
    "it is possible to approximate the two - mode potentials with lower - level dft calculations when using localized - mode coordinates , while still achieving the same level of accuracy as with a high - level ccsd(t)-f12x pes including up to three - mode potentials in terms of normal - mode coordinates .",
    "moreover , we observe that the two - mode couplings are significantly reduced in localized - mode coordinates , in particular within the subsets of modes that are used in the localization procedure . this can be exploited to neglect selected two - mode potentials or to replace them by their harmonic counterparts , without losing accuracy for the fundamental frequencies . in combination",
    ", these advantageous features of localized - mode coordinates can vastly reduce the number of single - point calculations needed to construct the pes and thus help to alleviate this computational bottleneck .",
    "in addition , we find that the convergence with respect to the vci excitation space proceeds more smoothly when using localized - mode coordinates .",
    "this could be exploited to reduce the computational effort required for this step , for instance by making schemes for the selection of the relevant excitations@xcite more efficient . moreover , as the error with small vci excitation spaces is significantly reduced when using localized - mode coordinates , it becomes possible to devise low - cost models that can give a first estimate of anharmonic frequency corrections . for our two test cases",
    ", we find that l - vci - s with only anharmonic one - mode potentials and harmonic two - mode potentials can provide such a qualitatively correct estimate for all fundamental vibrations , whereas with normal - mode coordinates , at least anharmonic two - mode potentials in combination with a significantly larger excitation space would be required .",
    "while similar benefits can also be achieved with optimized coordinates @xcite , localized - mode coordinates offer the advantage that they can be constructed _ a priori _ ,",
    "i.e. , no anharmonic pes is required for their construction . moreover , compared to other local coordinates@xcite or local ( curvilinear ) internal coordinates @xcite that could be employed to achieve such benefits in anharmonic vibrational calculations , the rigorously - defined localized modes used here do not require the manual _ ad hoc _ construction of vibrational coordinates . instead",
    ", only a chemically meaningful assignment of the normal modes to subsets is required as prerequisite for the localization procedure .",
    "the effect that the choice of these subsets has on the accuracy of the anharmonic vibrational frequencies will be subject of our future work .    thus , our results demonstrate that normal modes may not always be optimal for anharmonic vibrational calculations . in particular for well - localizable vibrations , such as c ",
    "h stretching and bending modes , localized modes are in general a better choice .",
    "the benefits of localized modes will become more pronounced with increasing size of the molecule , for which a better localization will be possible and for which further criteria , such as distance cut - offs,@xcite can be applied .",
    "finally , the strategies presented here are not limited to the calculation of fundamental frequencies , but will also be applicable when targeting overtones and combination bands .",
    "this will be addressed in our future work .",
