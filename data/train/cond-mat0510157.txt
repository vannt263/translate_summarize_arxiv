    "the importance of electronic structure calculations in solution is self - evident : chemistry in nature and in the laboratory often takes place in water or other solvents , or at a solid - solvent interface .",
    "this is true for all of biochemistry , for most of organic , inorganic , and analytical chemistry , and for a vast part of materials and surface sciences .",
    "the natural solution to this problem is to explicitly include the solvent molecules in the system , either as one or several solvation shells or as a bulk medium that fills the simulation box in periodic boundary conditions . such approach rapidly increases the expense of the calculation and is not always affordable .",
    "the reasons are twofold : the cost of an electronic - structure calculation scales as the cube of the number of atoms considered , at fixed density .",
    "also , one needs to ensure that the solvent is treated appropriately as a liquid medium , using e.g. extensive monte carlo or molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "given the large ratio between the number of degrees of freedom in the solvent vs. the solute , the statistical accuracy needed makes most of these approaches prohibitively expensive .",
    "the use of hybrid quantum - mechanical / molecular - mechanics ( qm / mm ) techniques,@xcite@xmath0@xcite in which the solvent atoms are represented with point ( or gaussian ) charges and classical potentials , can sensibly alleviate the cost of the computations , but does not remove the requirement of long dynamical trajectories of the combined quantum and classical fragments to simulate the liquid state of the solvent and to extract thermodynamical averages .",
    "alternative to these explicit approaches , a description of the solvent as a continuum dielectric medium surrounding a quantum - mechanical solute has long been established , and has proved efficient and accurate in a diversity of cases.@xcite@xmath0@xcite in continuum schemes the dielectric fills the space outside a cavity where the solute is confined ; the shape of this cavity , considered as a single sphere@xcite or ellipsoid in early implementations , has evolved to more realistic molecular shapes such as those defined by interlocking spheres centered on the atoms or by isosurfaces of the electron density.@xcite in the context of continuum models the interaction between the dielectric medium and the charge distribution of the solute provides the electrostatic part of the solvation free energy , @xmath1 , which is the dominant contribution for polar and charged solutes .",
    "solvation effects beyond electrostatic screening , conventionally partitioned in cavitation , dispersion , and repulsion,@xcite are also important and will be discussed in the context of our model in section ii . in principle , the application of continuum models demands that no strong specific interactions are present between the solvent and the solute molecules , although the solvent can always be reintroduced explicitly as an `` environmental '' skin for the first solvation shells .",
    "inexpensiveness is not the single asset of continuum models against explicit solvent methods .",
    "unless monte carlo or molecular dynamics techniques are used , it is unclear what orientation to choose for the molecules in an explicit solvent model , and even for a medium - sized solute there may be a large number of possible configurations with multiple local minima.@xcite more importantly , geometry relaxations will describe a solid or glassy phases for the solvent , with a mostly electronic dielectric screening that may differ substantially from its static limit .",
    "this is particularly true for water , where the static permittivity @xmath2 of the liquid is larger by a factor of twenty than its electronic @xmath3 contribution",
    ". when geometry optimizations including many solvent molecules are performed , changes in the solute  e.g . the hydration energy  remain `` buried '' or hidden by the large contributions coming from the energy of the solvent . to extract meaningful information , monte carlo or molecular dynamics simulations with accurate thermalizations and averaging times are necessary .",
    "still , it is far from clear that even first - principles molecular dynamics treatments of a solvent would provide the accuracy needed to reproduce static screening as a function of temperature ( as an example , the dielectric constant of water varies between 87.8 at 0 @xmath4 and 55.8 at 100 @xmath4 ) .",
    "room temperature is well below the debye temperature of many solvents , and thus the effect of quantum , bose - einstein statistics can be very important .",
    "in fact , recent first - principles molecular dynamics studies of water point to the fact that a combination of inaccuracies in the quantum - mechanical models ( such as density - functional theory in generalized - gradient approximations ) and the use of boltzmann statistics produce an overstructured description of water @xcite@xmath0@xcite , with apparent freezing roughly a hundred degrees above the experimental point .",
    "last , the relaxation times needed to extract thermodynamical data from a solvated system can be exceedingly long,@xcite compounding many of the issues highlighted here ( dynamical , as opposed to static screening , would require to take into account the solvent relaxation times , either explicitly or via a frequency - dependent dielectric model , but such a framework goes beyond the scope of this paper ) .",
    "continuum solvent methods are free from these issues , and for this reason alone they may be the first choice even when computational resources are not the main constraint .    the presence of a polarizable dielectric will induce a charge redistribution in the solute , which in turn will affect the polarization of the medium . in the self - consistent reaction field approach ( scrf )",
    "the dielectric medium and the electronic density respond to the electrostatic field of each other in a self - consistent fashion.@xcite over the past twenty five years a number of developments stemming from the scrf approach have been proposed and further elaborated .",
    "@xcite@xmath0@xcite among these , the polarizable - continuum model ( pcm ) of tomasi et al .",
    "@xcite and the conductorlike solvation model ( cosmo ) of klamt and schrmann@xcite are probably the most - widely used choices in quantum chemistry applications . in both cases the dielectric constant @xmath5 is taken to be 1 inside the cavity , and a fixed value outside ( equal to the dielectric constant of the solvent for pcm , or infinite for the case of cosmo ) .",
    "the electrostatic problem is then formulated in terms of apparent surface charges ( asc ) distributed on the solute - solvent interface . for first - principles",
    "molecular dynamics applications , the discontinuity of @xmath5 at the interface needs to be removed to calculate accurately the analytic derivatives of the potential with respect to the ionic positions .",
    "this may be accomplished with the use of a smoothly varying dielectric potential that restores well - behaved analytic gradients.@xcite still , born - oppenheimer ab - initio molecular dynamics in localized basis sets are demanding enough that they have yet to be combined , to the best of our knowledge , with the asc approach for realistic simulations of medium or large system .    on the other hand , first - principles implementations of the continuum solvent model within the car - parrinello framework@xcite have been devised,@xcite@xmath0@xcite",
    "even though dynamical studies have been reported , to the best of our knowledge , in only few cases.@xcite in this paper , we introduce a first - principles and conceptually simple approach to the calculation of cavitation energies based on the definition of a quantum surface for the solvent.@xcite we combine this scheme with the electrostatic solvation model of fattebert and gygi,@xcite , and find a level of accuracy at least as good as that of established quantum - chemistry treatments .",
    "the model requires no adjustable parameters other than a universal definition of the cavity ( practically depending on one parameter ) , and the dielectric constant and the surface tension of the solvent .",
    "this combined model is well suited for first - principles molecular dynamics calculations of large finite and extended systems , using e.g. efficient plane - wave car - parrinello implementations . in the following sections we describe the method and",
    "examine its performance in comparison with experiments and with the well - established pcm approach .",
    "finally , given that cavitation contributions can be particularly important in dimerization processes ( where the fusion of two cavities into one provides an additional stabilizing energy ) , we employ our method to study the association of the tetracyanoethylene ( tcne ) anion in solution@xcite by means of static and dynamical simulations , highlighting the role of the cavitation term in the dimerization .",
    "our continuum solvation model has been implemented in the public domain car - parrinello parallel code included in the quantum - espresso package,@xcite based on density - functional theory ( dft ) , periodic - boundary conditions , plane - wave basis sets , and pseudopotentials to represent the ion - electron interactions .",
    "all calculations reported in this work , unless otherwise noted , have been performed using vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials,@xcite with the kohn - sham orbitals and charge density expanded in plane waves up to a kinetic energy cutoff of 25 and 200 ry respectively . in the appendix we review the formalism used to calculate energies and forces in periodic boundary conditions in the context of our implementation .",
    "further details can be found in reference  @xcite .",
    "we adopt the definition introduced by ben - naim for the solvation free energy , @xcite in which @xmath6 corresponds to the process of transferring the solute molecule from a fixed position in the gas phase to a fixed position in the solution at constant temperature , pressure , and chemical composition . for calculation purposes and especially in the case of the continuum dielectric model , @xmath6 can be regarded as the sum of several components , of which the electrostatic , the cavitation , and the dispersion - repulsion contributions are the most relevant ( @xmath7).@xcite none of these , however , can be directly obtained through experiment , the sum of all of them , @xmath6 , being the only measurable quantity . in our model , @xmath1 and @xmath8",
    "are considered explicitly , while @xmath9 , less relevant for the systems considered here , is largely seized by virtue of the parametrization , as part of the electrostatic term .",
    "the dispersion - repulsion energy may be important in the case of hydrophobic and aromatic species , but its explicit calculation is beyond the aim of the present work  in particular , the implementation of the technique proposed by floris , tomasi and pascual ahuir@xcite would be straightforward in our model .",
    "the electrostatic interaction between the dielectric and the solute is calculated as proposed by fattebert and gygi.@xcite in the following we provide an outline of the model .",
    "the kohn - sham energy functional@xcite of a system of ions and electrons can be written as @xmath10 = t[\\rho]+ \\int v({\\bf r } ) \\rho({\\bf r } ) d{\\bf r } + e_{xc } + \\frac{1}{2 } \\int \\rho({\\bf r } ) \\phi[\\rho ] d{\\bf r}\\ ] ] where the terms on the right hand side correspond to the kinetic energy of the electrons , the interaction energy with the ionic potential , the exchange - correlation energy , and the electrostatic energy @xmath11 respectively . in the standard energy functional ,",

    "( 2 ) can be efficiently solved in reciprocal space with the use of fast fourier transforms , for arbitrary @xmath14 $ ] the poisson equation ( 3 ) must be solved with an alternative numerical scheme . in the present case ,",
    "it is discretized on a real space grid , and solved iteratively using a multigrid technique.@xcite the functional derivative of @xmath11 with respect to @xmath17 yields @xmath18 and an additional term @xmath19 , originating in the dependence of the dielectric function on the charge density : @xmath20 @xmath21 the self - consistent kohn - sham potential is constructed summing @xmath19 and the electrostatic potential @xmath18 , to which contributions from the exchange - correlation , and the local and non - local terms in the pseudopotentials are also added ( see appendix ) .",
    "the dielectric medium and the electronic density then respond self - consistently to each other through the dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath17 and viceversa .    as already mentioned in the introduction , in gaussian - basis sets implementations of the continuum model @xmath5",
    "is a binary function with a discontinuity at the cavity surface .",
    "the accurate representation of such a function would require unrealistic high kinetic energy cutoffs for the plane wave basis and expensive real space grids .",
    "the use of smoothly varying dielectric functions instead eases the numerical load and avoids discontinuities in the forces , essential to proper energy conservation during molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "also , a smooth decay of the permittivity in the proximity of the solute - solvent boundary may even be considered a more physical representation than a sharp discontinuity . in our implementation",
    "the dielectric medium is defined using two parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 : @xmath24 this function asymptotically approaches @xmath3 ( the permittivity of the bulk solvent ) in regions of space where the electron density is low , and 1 in those regions where it is high .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 is the density threshold determining the cavity size , whereas @xmath23 modulates the smoothness of the transition from @xmath3 to 1 .",
    "the cavitation energy @xmath8 is defined as the work involved in creating the appropriate cavity inside the solution in the absence of solute - solvent interactions.@xcite different approaches have been introduced to compute @xmath8 ; nevertheless it is unclear which one is the most accurate given the unavailability of experimental values to compare .",
    "formulations based on the scaled particle theory@xcite have been originally proposed by pierotti@xcite and further developed in several studies.@xcite@xmath0@xcite although these approaches are derived from a rigorous statistical mechanics standpoint , eventually the use of a set of fitted parameters is needed to represent an effective radius for the solvent and for the spheres centered on the solute atoms . for nonspherical cavities ,",

    "we rely on the parametrization of the density threshold @xmath22 to obtain an appropriate surface .",

    "we have adopted a value of @xmath42=0.0002 e in our simulations .",

    "the resulting value , @xmath610.00078 , was employed thereafter in all the simulations .",
    "this can be regarded as a rather universal choice for @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; reparametrizations for different solvents could be considered ( if enough experimental data were available ) probably gaining some marginal accuracy at the expense of generality .",

    "[ lattice ] also shows that total energies in solution quickly converge with respect to the size of the supercell , thanks to the dielectric screening of the coulombic interactions between periodic images .    with the exception of ch@xmath71 , the solutes in tables i and ii are either polar or ionic compounds of relatively small size .",
    "since the dispersion - repulsion energy is not explicitly accounted for in our model , its accuracy for systems in which this contribution becomes dominant , such as highly hydrophobic or aromatic compounds , will be necessarily affected ( this is already the case for methane ) . for the species listed in tables i and ii the dispersion - repulsion effect",
    "is captured to a large extent by our electrostatic term . as the size of the solute increases and its polarity decreases , though , the non - electrostatic terms tend to monopolize the solvation energy , and a model lacking the dispersion - repulsion contribution will perform poorly .",
    "this limitation could be possibly overcome by a different parametrization specific to large nonpolar solutes , or of course by directly computing the dispersion and repulsion contributions.@xcite      as a computational test , we performed canonical molecular dynamics simulations of a tetramer of d@xmath72o molecules ( heavy water ) , using our solvation - cavitation model to represent an aqueous solution . a time step of 0.192 fs and an electronic mass of 400 a.u .",
