    "note that gluon jets will contribute only at higher order .    at sps energies , we recover ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dilsps ] ) the well known result that the large mass dileptons have their origin predominantly in the drell - yan process . increasing the formation time from 0.20 fm/@xmath50 to 0.50 fm/@xmath50",
    " and thus lowering the initial temperature by 100 mev  drastically alters the thermal production ( from the dash - dotted curve to the long - dashed one ) while the yield from the proposed jet - plasma interaction , even though essentially negligible , is reduced by a factor of @xmath60 2 ( from the solid line to the long - dashed one ) .",
    "the jet - plasma interaction starts playing an interesting role at rhic energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dilrhic ] ) , as now the corresponding yield is about only one third of the drell - yan contribution , and is much larger than the thermal contribution . again lowering the initial temperature ( now by about 150 mev ) by increasing the formation time to 0.50 fm/@xmath50 further enhances the importance of the yield due to jet - plasma interaction .",
    "we add that this production is of the same order as that attributed to secondary - secondary quark - antiquark annihilation in a dilepton production calculation done using an earlier version of the parton cascade model @xcite .    the much larger initial temperatures likely to be attained at the lhc and the much larger ( mini)jet production lead to an excess of large mass dileptons from jet - plasma interactions which can be an order of magnitude larger ( at @xmath121 gev ) than that due to the drell - yan process .",
    "again , reducing the initial temperature by raising the formation time to 0.50 fm/@xmath50 reduces the jet - plasma yield by about a factor of 2 while the thermal yield is reduced far more .",
    "we recall that at lhc energies several calculations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) have reported a thermal yield larger than the drell - yan production .",
    "we find that the jet - plasma interaction enhances the large mass dilepton production considerably .",
    "the equilibrating plasma scenario discussed suggests that , while the quark and gluon fugacities may initially be less than unity , the initial temperature could be larger ( see table  [ tab : sspc ] ) .",
    "this results ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : chemrhic ] ) in a situation where the jet - plasma yield remains large .",
    "it is larger than the thermal yield , but still smaller than the drell - yan contribution at rhic energies .",
    "the results at lhc energies ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : chemlhc ] ) are particularly interesting because the large mass yield is completely dominated by the jet - plasma interactions , and this remains true even when only jets having @xmath122 gev are considered .",
    "we see that the quark jets passing through the qgp give rise to a large production of large mass dileptons , akin to the production of high energy photons through the same mechanism suggested earlier  @xcite .",
    "they should be absent in @xmath123 collisions and if no qgp is formed .",
    "we have noted that the results are sensitive to the initial conditions and the time the jet spends in the medium .    before summarizing",
    ", we would like to discuss some interesting extensions of this work .",
    "we have concentrated on quark jets .",
    "gluon jets would give rise to dileptons through the process @xmath124 .",
    "however , phase space considerations would tend to disfavour this process with respect to the channel considered in this work .",
    "but this contribution may still be large , especially as the gluonic jets are more numerous .",
    "this could also compensate for the additional @xmath125 needed .",
    "however , a previous dynamical calculation did find this contribution to be sub - leading @xcite .",
    "the discussions in this work can be easily extended to diphotons  @xcite .",
    "connected to that is the interesting question of the transverse momentum spectrum of the dileptons , both from the drell - yan process and the jet - plasma interaction .",
    "no k - factors were used for the electromagnetic processes in this first baseline investigation .",
    "a detailed quantitative calculation will of course require those , and we shall report on the results of those investigations in a future publication @xcite .",
    "we also add that one may in principle have a energy and @xmath112 dependent @xmath108-factor  @xcite while estimating the jet - distributions .",
    "however , it is known that at higher energies , where the discussed process becomes important , the @xmath112-dependence of the @xmath108-factor is weak  @xcite , when comparing nlo contributions to the lo contributions .",
    "the precise value for the k - factor is thus only a constant multiplicative factor and results for a different value can be easily obtained .",
    "a more serious modification of our results is expected from the fact that jets passing through the qgp will loose energy .",
    "we note though that quark jets , the focus of the present work , lose less energy than the gluon jets .",
    "furthermore , the number of quarks in the medium having a given transverse momentum @xmath112 drops rapidly as time passes , mainly due to the cooling ( in the plasma ) and also due to the free streaming of the jets .",
    "this limits the production of the dileptons mostly to the early times .",
    "several authors ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) have discussed the effect of energy loss on the drell - yan production of dileptons .",
    "this can be easily incorporated in the treatment given here .",
    "we have not compared our results to the correlated decay of charm quarks , which provide a large contribution to dileptons at rhic and lhc energies  @xcite , if the energy loss likely to be suffered by the charm quarks due to collisions and radiations is ignored .",
    "if we assume that the charm quarks may lose energy due to these processes  @xcite , then these contributions will be suppressed  @xcite .",
    "this debate @xcite has however not yet reached closure .",
    "a direct measurement could go a long way in settling this issue @xcite .",
    "we also recall that the source of dileptons discussed in the present work corresponds to the so - called secondary - secondary interactions in the parton cascade model , discussed in ref .",
    "however , it was pointed out  @xcite that the procedure adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite did not account for the fact that the final state partons emerging from a parton - parton collision continue to participate in the development of the cascade by fragmenting and scattering while a virtual photon leaves the system",
    ". it will be worthwhile to calculate the dilepton production within a ( correctly implemented ) parton cascade model  @xcite with these considerations .    in brief",
    ", we have discussed a unique source of large mass dileptons in relativistic collisions of heavy nuclei .",
    "it arises from the passage of quark jets through the quark gluon plasma .",
    "the contribution is found to be largest at lhc energies , moderate at rhic energies and negligible at sps energies .",
