    "<S> the back - action of the unsharp detection related to the spin observables , proposed in terms of the continuous quantum measurement theory , is observed via the von neumann measurement ( sharp detection ) of charges . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the continuous observation may accelerate the transitions between the spin states ( quantum anti - zeno effect ) , in contradiction with rapidly repeated observations , when it slows down the transitions . </S>",
    "<S> application of the two detector system , detecting the charge and spin observables , shows a partial quantum zeno effect in the charge current . due to the formalism </S>",
    "<S> , we can calculate the fluctuation spectrum @xmath0 of the charge detector , containing the rabi frequency damping , driven by the growing unsharp detection strength @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the fano factor , @xmath2 was also calculated as the function of @xmath1 , and shows a decreasing character , when the quantum anti - zeno effect occurs in the charge current . </S>"
