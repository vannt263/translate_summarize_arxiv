    "liquid crystal  colloid composites are an exciting class of soft materials which possess tunable elastic and optical properties . in bulk samples of colloidal particles dispersed in liquid crystals , the colloids can assemble into a wide range of structures . in nematics",
    ", colloids can form chains  @xcite and even a defect glass  @xcite . adding a degree of twist by using a chiral ( cholesteric ) liquid crystal ( clc ) increases the range of possibilities .",
    "the pitch length  the distance in which the nematic director rotates by @xmath0  of the cholesteric adds an additional length scale to the system similar to the colloidal length scale .",
    "competition between these mesoscopic scales leads to exciting new physics .",
    "colloids form plates @xcite , regular arrays tied together with knotted defects  @xcite and three dimensional colloidal crystals  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the system also become highly non linear and non stokesian @xcite .",
    "these composite materials have potential applications for example as biosensors  @xcite .",
    "these applications involve contact with another fluid phase and hence the colloids interact with a fluid  fluid interface .",
    "the interface between two immiscible fluids is energetically expensive .",
    "the two fluids will seek to minimise the surface area in contact .",
    "colloidal particles which are initially mixed into one of the two fluids can sequester to the interface and become trapped .",
    "a colloid removes a portion of the the interface and hence lowers the interfacial energy cost . in simple fluids ,",
    "where the young equation holds , the energy saving is expressed as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the interfacial tension , @xmath3 is the contact angle of the colloid with the interface and @xmath4 is the particle radius  @xcite . for the system discussed below with interfacial tension @xmath5  , a colloid radius of @xmath6 and assuming that the colloid is equally wetted by both fluids , @xmath7 , the energy saving is @xmath8 , thus thermal fluctuations will be unable to remove colloids from the interface .",
    "it is also important to note that in contrast to molecular surfactants , the colloids do not alter the interfacial tension between the liquids .",
    "colloidal particles are commonly used to stabilise fluid ",
    "fluid interfaces .",
    "careful control of the colloidal surface allows a variety of structures to be produced from simple particle stabilised emulsions  @xcite to more complex bicontinuous structures known as bijels @xcite .",
    "conversely , fluid ",
    "fluid interfaces can be employed to create ordered arrangements of particles trapped on the interface  @xcite .",
    "particles at fluid  fluid interfaces can self assemble at into a wide range of structures  @xcite deformations in the interface caused by gravity , shape anisotropy or surface roughness create interactions between particles",
    ". these capillary interactions , responsible for the clusters of cornflakes on the surface of the milk at breakfast @xcite are also an important tool in micro and nano - particle assembly . on flat interfaces between simple fluids , clusters of particles form at random locations @xcite .",
    "the location of clusters can be templated by manipulating the curvature of the interface  @xcite . by replacing one of the fluids with a liquid crystal , colloid self  assembly",
    "can be templated even on a flat interface by making use of topological defects in the bulk @xcite or at the interface between a simple fluid and the liquid crystal  @xcite .    at simple fluid  fluid interfaces ,",
    "the colloidal interactions which exist in the bulk phase are maintained .",
    "ordered arrays of repulsive colloids are seen  @xcite , some of which can be extraordinarily sparse  @xcite . at higher surface coverage",
    "the arrangements become disordered  @xcite .",
    "additional interactions can be created by interfacial deformations .",
    "such deformations can be created either via the weight of the colloid , the pinning of the contact line on the colloid or by distorting the whole interface .",
    "the interfacial deformations lead to capillary interactions which can be both attractive or repulsive  @xcite .",
    "the relative importance of gravity can be found by calculating the bond number ( ) the ratio between the gravitational forces and the surface tension .",
    "@xmath9 where @xmath10 is the difference in density between the solid and the fluid , @xmath4 is the particle size and @xmath2 is the surface tension between the two fluids . in cases where the bond number is small ( @xmath11 ) gravitational effects may be discounted .",
    "however , even in the case of small bond number the deformations caused by surface roughness  @xcite or particle shape  @xcite may still be present and lead to anisotropic interactions .",
    "when one of the fluids is replace by a liquid crystal additional effects come into play due to the anisotropic nature of the lc .",
    "colloids alter the ordientation of the director at their surface .",
    "the strength of this influence is characterised by an anchoring strength @xmath12 . for finite",
    "anchoring ( @xmath13 ) this imposed alignment breaks the orientational order of the liquid crystal and and leads to the formation of defects .",
    "the type of defect created depends on the anchoring type and strength at the colloid surface and the colloid size @xcite . at the fluid ",
    "lc interface the defects remain in the lc phase but are altered as the colloid is only partially submerged in the lc @xcite . altering the anchoring at the fluid  lc interface by adding a surfactant to the fluid phase has been shown to alter the defect structure at the colloid and hence the interactions between colloids @xcite .    recent work by cavallaro _",
    "@xcite has shown that colloids at a nematic  air interface interact with defects in the bulk of the liquid crystal . in equilibrium nematics",
    "are defect free so defects were created by using a micro - pillar array .",
    "the pillars were surrounded by ring defects at their mid - point were in the bulk of the lc .",
    "the defects set up a distorted director field which templated the assembly of the colloids into a ring on the interface above the defect .    the use of defects to template colloidal assembly can be extended to using pre - existing defects as templates .",
    "defects inherent in nematic droplets can have been shown to localise colloidal particles  @xcite . in bulk samples of blue phases and twist grain boundary phases",
    "the defects are also preferential sites for colloids @xcite .",
    "nano - particles have been shown to assemble at the interface of a clc in distinct stripes related to the cholesteric helix  @xcite . in this article",
    "the use of defected regions inherent in the cholesteric fingerprint texture as a templates for assembly of micron ",
    "sized particles is discussed .",
    "the interaction between colloids and liquid crystal defects is rarely straight forward .",
    "colloidal particles themselves produce defects in lc phases .",
    "how the defects associated with a colloidal particle interact with other defects present in the system can have a profound influence on the success or otherwise of templating .",
    "cholesteric liquid crystals possess orientational order but additionally break translational symmetry due to their chiral nature .",
    "the average orientation of the molecules , denoted by the director , @xmath14 , maps out a helix along an axis , @xmath15 .",
    "the distance taken for the director to rotate through @xmath0 gives the material an intrinsic length scale , the pitch length , @xmath16 .",
    "this periodic structure can be distorted in order to satisfy boundary conditions at a surface or in response to external fields or inclusions such as colloids .",
    "the layers can either be distorted elastically where the layers bend smoothly or via the formation of defects  @xcite .",
    "edge defect can be seen in the centre of the image .",
    "scale bar ]    in cholesterics the competition between the helical twist and surface anchoring of the liquid crystals leads to the appearance of striking textures . where the anchoring is homeotropic ( normal to the interface ) at both top and bottom surfaces the helical axis is forced to lie parallel to these surfaces and the fingerprint texture is observed .",
    "this texture appears as a periodic array of bright and dark stripes as in when imaged using polarising optical microscopy . using a confocal microscope the periodic nature of the helix",
    "can also be seen in a vertical slice through the interface ( c ) .",
    "the fingerprint texture is an example of frustrated orientational order as the constraints of both surface anchoring and helical twist can not be satisfied simultaneously  @xcite",
    ". for a reasonably high interfacial tension the frustration is resolved by the creation of a 2d array of defect lines at the interface , these are sketched in pink in ( a ) .",
    "the defect array costs the system additional elastic energy .",
    "colloids trapped at the interface can reduce the energy of the system by removing a portion of the defected region .",
    "the results of simulations  @xcite of the colloid - lc system for colloids with zero anchoring strength @xmath17 ( colloids do not influence the alignment of the lc at their surfaces ) in figures [ fig : zero_anchoring_graph ] and [ fig : min_loc ] show that the energy of the system depends on the position of the colloid with respect to the defect lines .",
    "the most favourable position varies with the particle size to pitch ratio @xmath18 .",
    "the equilibrium position of the colloid s centre changes according to where the colloid covers the greatest total length of defect .",
    "simulations in  @xcite for @xmath19 predict a favourable position for the colloid centre either exactly on top of an interfacial defect or exactly half way between them as seen in .",
    "+   +     in experiments performed with melamine colloids trapped at a cholesteric silicone oil interface  @xcite the position of the particles with respect to the stripe texture was measured .",
    "histograms of particle position with respect to the defect are plotted in and [ fig : p_hist13 ] .",
    "this distance is in units of @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the defect . for the particles in the longer pitch cholesteric @xmath22 shown in",
    "there is evidence of templating .",
    "colloids are found preferentially in localised in the defected regions .",
    "for the particles in the shorter pitch mixture @xmath23 no clear templating effect is seen .",
    "the templating of the smaller particles at the interface suggests that the interfacial defects have control the colloid position .",
    "however , the lack of a preferred position for the @xmath24 samples indicates that the physics is more complicated than the model discussed above . in the simple model , the anchoring strength @xmath12 at the colloid was set to zero ; the colloid acts as a free surface for the liquid crystal .",
    "hence , the colloids had no effect on the alignment of the liquid crystal .    in the experiments the anchoring strength is unknown",
    "but it is unlikely to be zero .",
    "further simulations at finite anchoring strength reveal that the colloids themselves create defects . these defects can interact with the interfacial defects as seen in to [ fig : rewire4 ] . for @xmath25 this rewiring of the defects",
    "has very little effect on the shape of the free energy landscape ( open symbols ) .",
    "however , for the @xmath24 case the energy landscape has been significantly altered .",
    "the position of the minimum has moved from its position of @xmath26 in the zero anchoring case to @xmath27 .",
    "this implies that the physics of the system is governed by anchoring strength @xmath12 as well as the particle size to pitch ratio @xmath18 .    in order to make comparisons a dimensionless ration",
    "@xmath28 is defined .",
    "it is the strength of the anchoring at the colloidal surface relative to bulk elasticity in the liquid crystal . for small @xmath29",
    "the colloid position depends solely on the ratio @xmath18 and seeks to cover the largest possible length of defect . as @xmath29",
    "is increased the energy landscape becomes more complex . for intermediate values of @xmath29 and @xmath23",
    "the landscape is fairly flat and rough as seen in .",
    "this landscape is unlikely to be able to act as a good template for colloids .",
    "assuming an intermediate anchoring strength @xmath12 , the lack of templating in our experimental system could be accounted for by this complex landscape .",
    "+        +     the sensitivity to the magnitude of @xmath30 is seen in other systems where colloids interact with defects .",
    "for example , the size of nano particles  @xcite and their surface anchoring  @xcite has been shown to have a profound effect on their ability to stabilise blue phases .",
    "elasticity mediated interactions have shown great promise for colloidal self assembly at both flat fluid  lc interfaces  @xcite and on the surface of nematic droplets  @xcite . here",
    ", we have shown that the by conflict between alignment at a clc  isotropic oil interface and the helical nature of the clc creates an array of interfacial defects .",
    "these defected regions can act as templates for the self assembly of colloidal particles .",
    "the success of the templating mechanism is sensitive to the balance between the anchoring strength at the colloid surface and the elasticity of the liquid crystal , @xmath28 . understanding this interplay between colloids and defects suggests mechanisms by which lc",
