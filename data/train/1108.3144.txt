    "atom - optical lens is one of the fundamental atom - optical elements , which can focus , collimate , image and transmit the atom beam .",
    "therefore it has been implemented in many ways , such as , atom lithography , atom interferometry and atom interference . up to now",
    "two kinds of atomic lens , based on magnetic or far - detuned optical fields , have been developed .",
    "focusing has been achieved through magnetic lenses prl67 - 2439 , prl87 - 030401 , pra65 - 031601,apb2007 .",
    "atom - optical lens based on magnetic fields are advantageous for coherent atom - optic research owing to their extremely high optical quality .",
    "the focusing dynamics have also been investigated with magnetic atomic lens ; specifically , the isotropic three - dimensional ( 3d ) focusing of atoms with a single - impulse magnetic lens @xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to build flexible optical systems because magnetic atom - optical elements have a large scale .",
    "laser beams are often used to build atom - optical lens because of their interaction with atoms @xcite .",
    "they have a small scale and is flexible to realize the combination of atomic lenses .",
    "for example , atom - optical lenses can be achieved through red - detuned gaussian beams or blue - detuned doughnut beams @xcite .",
    "there are other ways to achieve an atom - optical lens , such as by the use of radiation - pressure force @xcite , near - field light joa8 - 153 , pra77 - 013601 , and far - detuned and resonant standing wave fields @xcite .",
    "a focused gaussian laser beam with red detuning also can be used as an atom - optical lens .",
    "early experiments demonstrated this kind of atomic beams focusing using the dipole force @xcite .",
    "the focusing dynamics of a trapped bec interacting with laser pulses have also been investigated @xcite .",
    "aberration - free atom - optical lenses based on the optical dipole force have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "heating and cooling effects caused by an adiabatic compression and expansion when the cold atomic cloud is close to or far from the focus of the gaussian beam , respectively , have likewise been found @xcite .    in previous work",
    "we have numerically and experimentally studied the ultracold atomic cloud and bec wave packet passing through focused red - detuned gaussian laser beam@xcite .",
    "the focusing , advancement and one - dimensional collimation effects have been observed , which agreed with the numerical simulation results .",
    "specially , the one - dimensional collimation effect of wave cloud is interesting because it is very useful in many important aspects required low divergence sources , such as atom lithography , atom interferometry , atomic fountain cloud , atomic physics collision experiments , ultra high resolution optical spectrum , quantum frequency standard and atom interference .",
    "one method of producing such highly collimated beams is using one - dimensional cooling technologyap1984 .",
    "another one - dimensional collimation method is also realized when atomic beam through atomic lens based on magnetic field@xcite .",
    "our method , however , has the advantage of small scale and flexible adjustment of the parameters of the atomic lens .    in this work the object - image relation and the collimation of the atom - optical lens created by the far red - detuned gaussian beams are studied theoretically and experimental .",
    "this work is helpful to further understand the properties of atom - optical lens and one - dimensional collimation effect of atomic cloud without cooling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we first investigate the optical properties , such as object - image relation , focal length of atomic lens induced by far red - detuned gaussian laser beam using particle tracing method when the atom is with uniform velocity and under gravity field , respectively . in sec .",
    "iii the collimation effect is analytically studied , and then the numerical simulation is used to verify the valid of the analytical results . in sec .",
    "iv the experimentally studying of the focusing , imaging and collimation effect is also presented and discussed .",
    "finally we conclude the work .",
    "in figure 1 , we consider a cold atomic cloud with initial temperature @xmath1 located at the position @xmath2 .",
    "when the atomic cloud with initial translational velocity @xmath3 propagates along @xmath4 axes to a far red - detuned focused gaussian laser beam , the atomic cloud undergoes enough free expansion that the position of every atoms in the cloud is correlated with its velocity distribution .",
    "the potential induced by the laser beam has the following form : @xmath5where @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 is determined by the intensity in the center of the gaussian beam , and @xmath8 is the waist width of the gaussian beam .",
    "@xmath9 presents the detuning between the laser frequency and the transition frequency of the atom , and @xmath10 represents the decay rate of the atomic excited state owing to spontaneous radiation . when the detuning is red , the potential is negative and presents an attractive force when the atoms passing through it .",
    "the red - detuned gaussian laser beam can therefore serve as a focal cylindrical atomic lens .",
    "now we will investigate the optical properties of the atomic lens , such as object - image relation , focal length and aberration , by solving the motion equation of atoms :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the atom mass .      because nonlinear coupling eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) is difficult to solve , without loss of physics , we assume that the incident kinetic energy @xmath13 , so the velocity along @xmath4 direction is almost not changed in the process , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "now , the potential can be expressed as    @xmath15    substituting eq .",
    "( [ v1 ] ) into equation ( [ r ] ) one obtains    [ c - e ] @xmath16where    @xmath17    eq.([c - e ] ) shows that the motion of atoms in different directions is decoupled .",
    "the motion of atoms in central attractive force now reduces to the motion of the atom under the time dependent force along @xmath18 direction . owing to",
    "no interaction happened along @xmath19 direction in our model , hereafter transverse direction only means @xmath18 direction .    from fig .",
    "[ focusscheme1 ] one observes that the deflection angle of atom passing through laser beam relates with the change of velocity of the atom along @xmath18 direction .",
    "the momentum change along @xmath18 direction can be found with the law of impulse - momentum    @xmath20    we assume the shift of the atom in the effective interaction range @xmath21 ( see fig .",

    "one can see that the parameter @xmath68 can denotes the degree of paraxial approximation .",
    "4 shows the transverse rms velocity ( thin solid lines ) as function of the object distance .",
    "we find that the transverse rms velocity first decreases , then increases and finally decreases and asymptotically tends to initial one with increasing the object distance .",
    "obviously , there exists a region in which the transverse rms velocity is smaller than the initial one .",
    "this phenomenon can be interpreted that , when the object distance is very short , the size of the atomic cloud @xmath69 is far smaller than the waist of laser beam @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath70 , therefore the paraxial approximation is well satisfied . under this condition",
    "the laser beam can be viewed as an ideal lens , and eq .",

    "the deflection angle of hot atom is less than that of those cool atoms .",
    "the total effect is that , involving the aberration , the transverse rms velocity is smaller than the ideal one . if the object distance continuously increases , the size of the atomic cloud @xmath73 will be much greater than that of the laser beam and less atoms deflected by the atomic lens , and the final transverse rms velocity tends asymptotically to the initial rms velocity .",

    "4 one can also observe that the minimum transverse rms velocity is about @xmath76 for @xmath77 while the one is about @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "this tells us that the lower initial rms velocity is helpful to raise the collimation efficiency , which implies that atomic lens is suitable for collimating ultracold atomic cloud rather than hot atomic cloud .    to verify the analytic result",

    "one notes that the analytical results agree well with the simulation ones ( represented by the square symbol ) .    in the following text",
    ", we will discuss the vertical velocity spread of the atomic cloud . according to the law of conservation of energy , in the dipole conservative potential , the change in the kinetic energy of the atom along @xmath83 direction should be equal to that along @xmath18 direction    @xmath84    here",

    "we can explain this phenomenon by the fact that , compared with vertical kinetic energy , the energy transferred from transverse direction to vertical direction is so small that the corresponding vertical velocity and its width is almost not changed .",

    "( [ vy ] ) one gets    @xmath96 ,   \\label{vyg}\\ ] ]    where @xmath97 .",
    "so the transverse rms velocity of the atomic cloud in the gravity is    @xmath98    where @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "( [ tyg ] ) is similar with that in the uniform velocity case .    in the gravity case , @xmath101 ,",
    "which is not dependent on the initial height of the atomic cloud but proportional to the strength of the laser beam .",
    "fig . 5 plots @xmath102 against @xmath7 with different waists of the laser beam .",
    "we see that the transverse rms velocity first decreases and then increases with increasing rabi frequency , which is similar with that in the uniform velocity case . additionally , from fig . 4 one can notice that large waist of the laser beam is helpful to obtain better collimation effect .",
    "it is readily understandable that the waist of the laser beam is larger , the ratio of the size of atomic cloud to the width of the laser beam is smaller , and laser beam is more like an ideal lens , the collimating efficiency is therefore improved .",

    "after the atomic number in the uhv - mot is stable , we did optical molasses and then loaded atoms into a quadrupole - ioffe - configuration ( quic ) trap .",
    "evaporative cooling of the atoms was performed by rf - induced spin flips .",
    "we swept the rf frequency from 25mhz to a value of around 1.6mhz over a period of 28s .",
    "atomic clouds with various temperatures from about 1@xmath0k to below the phase transition point were obtained by setting different rf frequencies .",
    "the cold atomic cloud then ballistically expanded after the magnetic trap was switched off .",
    "the direction of propagation of the focused gaussian beam and the probing beam was parallel to the long axis of the quic trap .",
    "therefore , the cold atomic clouds symmetrically distributed in the probing plane before traversing the gaussian beam . we acquired the distribution of atomic clouds from absorption images , as shown in fig .",
    "the rayleigh length was about 8.5 mm .",
    "since the rayleigh length was far greater than the scale of the atomic cloud while it was passing the light beam , we could approximate that the laser beam provided a two - dimensional gaussian potential .",
    "when evaporative cooling was finished , we released the atomic cloud from the quic trap and turned on the gaussian beam .",
    "after the atomic cloud had passed through it , we turned off the gaussian beam and waited for several milliseconds .",
    "all information regarding the atomic cloud were derived from the absorption images .",
    "5 is a typical experimental result about the focusing of the atomic cloud passing through the laser beam . from absorption images and",
    "cross section of optical depth we can see that the atomic clouds are focused by the laser beam compared to the reference one . obviously , the focusing just happened on the transverse direction , while the vertical direction remains unchanged . owing to the finite action length of the laser beam , just part of the atomic cloud is focused",
    ". with increasing the initial temperature , the focused part is increasing .",
    "we fit the cross curves by an asymmetric bi - gaussian to derive the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the width of the focused part in the atomic clouds along transverse direction . under the experimental parameters , the imaging time @xmath108ms , the flying time @xmath109ms ,",
    "according to the previous analysis , the fwhm widths of the focused part should be about 8@xmath0 m .",
    "however , the experimental results are both of them are about 13@xmath0 m and greater than the theoretical prediction , which is mainly caused by the aberration of the atom - optical lens @xcite .",
    "imaging is one of important properties of atom - optical lens .",
    "if an atomic cloud with very lower initial temperature passes through the laser beam , according to eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) , the fwhm width of the focused atomic cloud will be    @xmath110    obviously , when @xmath111 , the fwhm is inversely proportional to the flying time , which is plotted by solid line in fig .",
    "the experimental result is well consistent with the analytical prediction .",

    "@xcite , when the initial temperature of the atomic cloud is high , only the part with lower transverse velocity is focused , other part not interacts with the laser beam .",
    "there are focused and unfocused parts in the atomic cloud after it passing through the laser beam . by measuring the rms widths of the focused and unfocused parts in the atomic cloud",
    ", one can determined the total velocity spread and then measure the total collimation effect .",
    "the transverse rms velocities of focused part and unfocused part are    @xmath112    and    @xmath113    where @xmath114and @xmath114 are fwhm width of focused and unfocused parts in the atomic cloud .",

    "7 shows the experimental result of the total transverse rms velocity with dependence of the initial rms velocity of the atomic cloud . obviously , the total transverse rms velocity is smaller than the initial one , that is to say , the atom - optical lens efficiently collimate cold atomic clouds . with the parameters experimentally available ,",
    "the collimation effect is not very well when the the initial velocity spread ( temperature ) is lower .",
    "we study the optical properties of the atomic lens induced by the far red - detuned laser beam and collimation effect of atomic cloud passing through the atomic lens , with uniform translational velocity and with vanishing initial translational velocity in gravity , respectively . based on the atom deflection in dipole conservative potential , the object - image relation and the focal length of the atomic lens",
