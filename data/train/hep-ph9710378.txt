    "in recent years , considerable attention has been paid to polarized deep inelastic scattering experiments , to the interpretation of the corresponding data in the framework of perturbative qcd , and to the phenomenological extraction of non - perturbative spin - dependent parton distributions .",
    "the intense activity around these issues have come not only from the interesting developments and discussions that have arisen in each of them , but also from the fact that , combined , they are the most appropriate tools to unveil the spin structure of nucleons , a subject that is still being debated .    in fact , an increasing amount of high - precission totally inclusive data , collected by different collaborations over the last few years combined with the recent computation of the complete perturbative qcd corrections up to next - to - leading order of the inclusive cross sections , have lead to several qcd analyses and also extractions of polarized parton distributions @xcite .",
    "they demostrate that these data are not sufficient to accurately extract the spin - dependent quark and gluon densities of the nucleon . in order to improve our knowledge on polarized parton distributions new less - inclusive processes than dis have to be considered .",
    "one of the sources foreseen for additional data that can be included in those analyses is the so - called semi - inclusive spin - dependent asymmetries .",
    "these asymmetries are particularly sensitive to specific combinations of partons of different flavours and have been proposed and used to study the valence - quark distributions in the proton @xcite .",
    "more recently , a large amount of more accurate semi - inclusive data have been produced , and also the appropriate perturbative tools for their analysis have been developed @xcite . in the first part of this work , we show the results of a nlo extraction of polarized parton distributions from both inclusive and semi - inclusive data and analyze the impact of the semi - inclusive one in the global fit , including the obtention of _ valence _ distributions from the semi - inclusive data alone @xcite .    on the other hand , in order to obtain information on the polarized gluon distribution",
    "it is necessary to pick up an observable which has a gluonic contribution already at lowest order .",
    "one of them is the production of a ( charged ) hadron with large transverse momentum @xmath0 , specially in the case of photoproduction where a larger number of hadrons is obtained . compared to the case of jet - production",
    ", the production of charged hadrons allows to go to lower values of @xmath0 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that a polarized version of hera collider would give a very promising and useful facility to study photoproduction reactions . in order to make reliable quantitative predictions for such a high - energy proces , it is crucial to extend lo studies to nlo .",
    "the key issues here are to check the perturbative stability and to partially cancell the scale dependence of the observable . as the second part of this contribution we show the results obtained from a nlo computation of the _ direct _ part of the ( semi - inclusive ) photoproduction of hadrons @xcite .",
    "the semi - inclusive asymmetry can be written as : @xmath1 where the superscript @xmath2 denotes the hadron detected in the final state , and the variable @xmath3 is given by the ratio between the hadron energy and that of the spectators in the target .",
    "the semi - inclusive spin - dependent structure function @xmath4 can be decomposed into convolutions between parton densities @xmath5 , @xmath6 , unpolarized fragmentation functions @xmath7 , coefficient functions @xmath8 , and polarized fracture functions @xmath9 , the latter being given by the contribution to the target fragmentation region as @xmath10 \\right .   \\\\",

    "c_{i}+\\delta m_{g}^h \\otimes \\delta c_{g } ] \\right \\ } \\nonumber .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a complete computation of this kind of observable and the full expressions for the corresponding coefficient functions in different factorization schemes can be found in ref .",
    "an analogous expression can be written for the unpolarized semi - inclusive structure function @xcite .    in our computations",
    "we use the charged pion and kaon fragmentation functions of ref . @xcite",
    "combined with a parametrization of semi - inclusive emc data @xcite .",
    "the unpolarized observables are constructed using the parton distributions of ref .",
    "@xcite in their lo and nlo ( @xmath11 ) versions , according to the order of the fit , and with the appropiate qcd coefficients . polarized and unpolarized fracture functions @xcite describe the details of hadronization processes coming mainly from target fragmentation region .",
    "although their inclusion is crucial in order to consistently factorize collinear divergences , once this process is through , their actual contribution to the cross sections can be be suppressed by imposing the appropriate kinematical cuts .",
    "consequently , we restrict our analysis to single asymmetries for @xmath12 , leaving for the moment the discussion of difference asymmetries , and neglecting fracture function contributions .    in the present analysis , rather than adopting some or other stringent constraint on the normalization of the valence , sea quarks , or gluon densities , then singling out the set that presents the lowest @xmath13 ( given those and other less apparent assumptions ) , we adopt a more flexible scheme for the valence and sea sectors , we put greater emphasis on the measured region , and we explore different gluon possibilities .    as we are primarily interested in the measured region , we adopt a rather simple parametric form for the input spin - dependent valence quark densities : @xmath14 where the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 are obtained from the fitting procedure , and @xmath17 is externally fixed by the positivity constraint with respect to grv unpolarized parton distributions at large @xmath18 .",
    "the initial scale @xmath19 is chosen to be @xmath20gev@xmath21 . in order to trace and parametrize the departure from the su(2 ) and",
    "su(3 ) flavour symmetries , we define the normalization coefficients @xmath22 in terms of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 constants and two additional parameters . @xmath25 and @xmath26 the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 account quantitatively for eventual departures from flavour symmetry considerations ( including also some uncertainties on the low-@xmath18 behaviour ) .",
    "they also measure the degree of fulfilment of the bjorken and ellis - jaffe sum rules .",
    "for the light quarks the proposed input density is given by : @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are only constrained by positivity .",
    "the same functional dependence and considerations are used for gluons , since using more parameters seems to be useless , taking into account the uncertainties on them . for strange quarks",
    "we adopt : @xmath33 finding pointless the addition of more parameters . in order to avoid possible higher - twist contributions ,",
    "we have taken into account only measurements with @xmath34gev@xmath21 given a total of 133 inclusive data points .",
    "as semi - inclusive data we take those recently presented by smc @xcite , 48 data points , which then lead to combined global fits with 181 data points .",
    "correlations between totally - inclusive and semi - inclusive smc data sets have been taken into account , and increase the total @xmath13 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     .",
    "the impact of the semi - inclusive data in the total fit has been estimated performing also fits using only inclusive data . in these fits",
    "we have found that the quark parameters change less than @xmath35 , whereas the changes are a somewhat larger for the gluon distribution . however , the uncertainties already pointed out about the gluon density dominate over any potential influence of the semi - inclusive data set .",
    "the reasons for this very small impact are , basically , the fact that semi - inclusive data has not reached yet the precision and statistical significance of the inclusive one , and also that the data sets are not completely independent .",
    "this can be seen either in the correlations between inclusive and semi - inclusive asymmetries @xcite , and also in the fact that parametrizations obtained using only inclusive data give a very good description of the semi - inclusive asymmetries .",
    "additionaly , it is possible to use the semi - inclusive data in qcd global fits but without employing the inclusive data sets directly , for the comparison of the corresponding results . as in this case , not all the parameters can be unambiguously fixed by the semi - inclusive data alone , we have fixed the ones corresponding to the gluon and sea densities to the values obtained in set 2 , and then adjusted only the valence - quark distributions .    in these fits , the @xmath13 values with respect to the semi - inclusive data , @xmath36 ,",
    "are reduced in some units ; however , the total @xmath13 increases dramatically to unacceptable values ( @xmath37 ) , the main difference being in the @xmath38 distribution , as can be seen in fig .",
    "3 , where the parton densities are shown at the common value of @xmath39 gev@xmath21 .",
    "as can be observed the @xmath40 distribution is in very good agreement with the one obtained in the global analysis .    in the semi - inclusive case , the @xmath38 distribution is mainly constrained by the deuteron asymmetry , different from the inclusive case , where is determined by the more accurate e-154 neutron data . as can be seen in fig .",
    "2 , the difference between the result for the deuteron asymmetry coming either from the combined fit or the semi - inclusive one is apparent , even though the @xmath38 distributions are quite different , showing the low sensitivity of deuteron observables to this density .",
    "of course all the distributions are compatible if the errors not shown in the plot are taken into account .",
    "ongoing semi - inclusive measurements using @xmath41he targets at hermes can be quite useful in the determination of valence - quark distributions from semi - inclusive data alone , and also as further constraints in global fits .",
    "these asymmetries are particularly sensitive to @xmath38 , specially the one for the production of positively charged hadrons , as can be expected from very simple arguments based on the values of the corresponding fragmentation functions .",
    "as it was already stated , the photoproduction of charged hadrons is a very well suited process to pin down the polarized gluon distribution of the proton but also the polarized parton distributions of the _ photon _ in the case of colliders .",
    "the knowledge of the nlo corrections for this process allows to analyze the perturbative stability by means of the @xmath42-factor , which is essential in order to establish the kinematical range of applicability of the qcd method and to confirm the lo expectations @xcite .",
    "it can tell us , for instance , which is the minimun value of @xmath0 that can be considered for this observable in order to increase the statistics but , at the same time , allowing for a perturbative interpretation of the result .",
    "moreover , at lo three different scales appear , @xmath43 as the argument of @xmath44 and @xmath45 as the scales where the parton distributions and the fragmentation functions are evaluated respectively .",
    "the lo treatment leads then to a strong dependence of the cross section on the choice of these arbitrary scales , via either the value of the coupling constant or the altarelli - parisi evolution of the distributions .",
    "this dependence is partially cancelled by the addition of the nlo corrections .",
    "as it has been well established in the unpolarized case , the real photon will not only interact in a direct way , but can also be resolved into its hadronic structure . as was shown in @xcite ,",
    "the resolved component is subdominant with respect to the direct one in certain regions of rapidity and transverse momentum of the produced hadron or jet , thus maintaining the clear - cut sensitivity to @xmath46 resulting from the direct piece .",
    "the first basic ingredient for the extension to nlo has been provided in the past two years by the fact mentioned in the last section that nlo fits to polarized dis data have been performed , yielding spin - dependent nucleon parton distributions evolved to nlo accuracy .",
    "focussing on the direct part of inclusive - hadron photoproduction , the calculation of the polarized cross section to nlo is then completed by using also ( unpolarized ) nlo fragmentation functions for the produced hadron ( as provided in @xcite ) , and by including the @xmath47 corrections to the spin - dependent direct subprocesses for the inclusive production of a certain parton that fragments into the hadron .",
    "the calculation of the latter is the purpose of this paper .",
    "an immediate problem arises here as the direct part on its own is no longer a really well - defined quantity beyond the lo .",
    "this is due to the fact that beyond lo collinear singularities appear in the calculation of the subprocess cross sections for photon - parton scattering which are to be attributed to a collinear spliting of the photon into a @xmath48 pair and need to be absorbed into the photon structure functions . as the latter only appear in the resolved part of the cross section , and since factorizing singularities is never a unique procedure , it follows that only the sum of the direct and the resolved pieces is independent of the factorization scheme chosen and thus physical .",
    "this has been known for a long time from the unpolarized case where the corrections to the direct @xcite _ and _ to the resolved @xcite contributions have all been calculated .",
    "nevertheless , we will concentrate in this work only on the corrections to the direct part of the polarized cross section , mainly because this calculation  albeit already being quite involved  is much simpler than the one for the resolved piece .",
    "our results will therefore only be the first step in a full calculation of nlo effects to polarized inclusive - hadron photoproduction . despite the fact that they are not complete in the sense discussed above",
    ", we believe our results to be very important both phenomenologically and theoretically : the direct component dominates at fixed target energies and also still for the hera collider situation in certain regions of phase space .",
    "this means that our nlo results should be rather close to the true nlo answer in these cases even if the resolved component is only taken into account on a lo basis , which in turn implies that our nlo corrections should already be sufficient to shed light on the question of general perturbative stability raised above .",
    "we also mention in this context that our results for the nlo corrections to the direct hard subprocess cross sections will help to obtain or check those for the resolved ones as the abelian ( qed - like ) parts of the two are the same .",
    "the task amounts then to compute the matrix elements corresponding to the following @xmath49 processes @xmath50 and the virtual corrections for the first three ones .",
    "they have been obtained from the original computation of the matrix elements contributing to polarized prompt photon production in @xcite crossed to give the required ones .",
    "they are computed in dimensional regularization within the hvbm scheme @xcite which provides a consistent implementation of @xmath51 .",
    "it should be noticed that the same matrix elements are the ones appearing at nlo in the case of photoproduction of either two jets or two charged hadrons , which has also been proposed to extract the polarized gluon distribution from fixed target experiments @xcite . this computation is also a first step towards those interesting results .",
    "the phase space integration over the unobserved partons , the most complicated task , is done in the canonical way and a precise description of the method can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the infrared poles coming from the integrated @xmath49 processes are cancelled when the virtual corrections are added , and the remaining collinear poles are factorized in the corresponding distributions , including the photonic ones .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the results for the @xmath42-factor computed in the kinematical region of hera more propitious to give information about @xmath46 , i.e , @xmath52 , as a function of the transverse momentum of the hadron .",
    "there are mainly two uncertanties which are shown in the plots : the one stated above about the fact that only the direct contribution has been computed at nlo , and then there is a dependence on the factorization scheme chosen for polarized parton distribution in the _",
    "photon_. in this case we show results in the most used schemes : @xmath11 and @xmath53 . as can be seen",
    "there is only a mild dependence on them due to the fact that the direct contribution is much larger than the resolved one in this kinematical region , and then a large dependence of the _ resolved _ one on the scheme , to cancel a possible large one from the direct part , can not be expected .",
    "the second uncertainty comes from the fact stated in the last section : the dominant polarized gluon distribution is not well constrained by the fits and the lo and nlo parametrizations can largely differ beyond the expectations from perturbative stability . as a result",
    ", it turns out that the @xmath42-factor could be dominated by the ratio @xmath54 instead of the hard cross section . in order to analyze it",
    "we compute the @xmath42-factor using two different polarized parametrizations @xcite : the usual grsv valence ( fig .",
    "4b ) and a similar set where the polarized gluon distribution is assumed to be equal to the unpolarized one at a very small scale ( @xmath55gev@xmath21 ) ) , and then , perturbatively stable by construction ( fig .",
    "as can be observed the results are very similar in the region of @xmath56 gev and differ only for larger values of @xmath0 which correspond to the kinematical region where the cross section becomes negligible ( the end of the phase space for this process ) .",
    "the @xmath42-factor is found to be moderate for the polarized cross section in the region of @xmath57 gev , and the situation is even better for the asymmetry where a cancellation between unpolarized and polarized @xmath42-factors occurs , as shown in fig .",
    "4.c , where the unpolarized cross section at nlo has been computed adding both direct and resolved contributions .    in fig .",
    "4.d we show the dependence of the direct part of the polarized cross section on the arbitrary scales at a value of @xmath58 gev and the same rapidity as before , at both lo and nlo . in this case",
    "all the scales are assumed to be equal to @xmath59 , and the @xmath60 dependence is analyzed . as can be observed the nlo result is much more stable and its dependence on @xmath60 is smaller than 10% for @xmath61 , showing the relevance of the corrections .",
    "performing a lo and nlo global analysis to both inclusive and semi - inclusive polarized deep inelastic data , we have found that the present semi - inclusive data can be consistently included in global analyses .",
    "these global fits show features similar to those coming from totally inclusive data , i.e. , a poorly constrained gluon distribution and better determined valence densities , with the semi - inclusive data introducing very small modifications in the valence densities .",
    "present semi - inclusive data alone fail to define a @xmath38 distribution consistent with those extracted from inclusive data ; consequently , the corresponding sets can not reproduce the inclusive asymmetries for neutron targets . however",
    ", ongoing semi - inclusive experiments using @xmath41he targets , or more accurate measurements on proton and deuteron targets , can reverse this situation and provide an enhanced perspective of the spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "we have also presented for the first time the nlo corrections to the direct component of the photoproduction of charged hadrons , which is a process specially suited to give information on th polarized gluon distributions .",
    "it was found that the observable is perturbatively stable in the region of @xmath57 gev for the hera kinematics , validating the existing lo analysis . both semi - inclusive observables , usually not taken into account in the analysis for the unpolarized case due to the large variety of available data , will play a fundamental role in order to increase our knowledge about the polarized structure of the hadrons .",
