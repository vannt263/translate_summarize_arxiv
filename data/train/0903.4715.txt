    "precision measurements of the two - photon decay widths of these pseudoscalar mesons will provide a rich experimental data set to understand qcd at low energies .    with the recent availabilities of high energy and high precision intense photon tagging facilities  @xcite together with the novel developments in electromagnetic calorimetry it is feasible to perform percent level differential cross section measurements of light pseudoscalar mesons @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 on nuclei  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the two - photon decay widths of these mesons can be extracted from these experiments , performed at forward angles using the primakoff method  @xcite , which assumes production of mesons in the coulomb field of nuclei .",
    "however , the production process may also be manifested by exchange of vector mesons having the same quantum numbers as the photon .",
    "the angular distributions of these two production mechanisms are realized differently in the cross sections .",
    "the primakoff production is very sharply peaked at forward angles ( 0.02 degree at @xmath55 gev ) with practically vanishing strength at few degrees .",
    "the strong production is small under the primakoff peak , but it begins to dominate at few degrees .",
    "the interference of these two coherent amplitudes with its significant magnitude under the primakoff peak , makes the extraction of the decay widths quite difficult .",
    "the full theoretical description of this process , in addition to the above two mechanisms , requires a correct treatment of the final state interactions ( fsi ) of the produced mesons in nuclear matter , as well as accounting for incoherent processes .",
    "this is necessary to provide a percent level extraction of the decay widths from the experimental data set . in this paper",
    "we present more general , and perhaps more complete , theoretical descriptions of these photoproduction mechanisms in nuclei .",
    "we focus on the example of @xmath0 production keeping in mind that the presented results can be extended to @xmath1 and @xmath2 production with appropriate replacements of the parameters and cross sections .    in 1951",

    "that we are considering coherent photoproduction of pseudoscalar mesons on a nucleus at high energies : + a ps + a ;   ps=^0,,^ [ eq1 ]            as mentioned above , the main challenge in the determination of pion lifetime in this way is related to the presence of the strong amplitude in the photoproduction process ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . the full amplitude of this coherent process can be described as a sum of the coulomb , @xmath6 , and the strong , @xmath7 , parts : t = t_c+e^it_s [ eq2 ] where @xmath8 is the relative phase between the coulomb and the strong amplitudes .",
    "taking into the account the incoherent processes , the differential cross section can be expressed as : = =  ^2 +   [ eq-2 ] where @xmath9 is the incoherent cross section , _",
    "i.e. _ , processes involving excitation or breakup of the target nucleus .",
    "each of these amplitudes factorizes into a photoproduction amplitude on a nucleon multiplied by a corresponding form factor .",
    "in addition , these form factors must be modified for the final state interactions of the outgoing mesons with nucleons .",
    "interaction of incident high energy photons with nuclear matter gives rise to a shadowing effect , which has to be considered as well .",
    "the effect of the pion final state interactions ( fsi ) in nuclei was first discussed in detail by g. morpurgo  @xcite , who considered absorption of the produced pions in the strong nuclear field using the distorted wave approximation ( dwa ) .",
    "calculations of the electromagnetic and strong form factors in this work have been done with the uniform nuclear density distribution @xmath10 .",
    "based on these assumptions , part of the correction to the strong and electromagnetic form factors , which takes into account pion absorption in nuclei , is correctly obtained .",
    "however , the effect of the pion re - scattering to forward angles was not taken into account in this work .",
    "this effect is important for the precision extraction of the decay widths since pions initially produced at modest angles can re - scatter to small angles .",
    "this effect was first considered by g.fldt  @xcite in non - diffractive production processes on nuclei in the framework of the glauber theory of multiple scattering  @xcite . a general expression ( eq .",
    "3.2 in  @xcite ) for the electromagnetic amplitude was obtained in this paper , but an analytically integrable formula was derived for the case of equal absorption in a nucleus of the incident and produced particles only ( eq .",

    "the coulomb amplitude of the photoproduction of mesons on nuclei can be expressed as : t_c & = & z()^3/2 f_em(q , ) [ eq4 ] where the electromagnetic form factor is given by  @xcite : f_em(q,)&= & j_1(q b ) e^iz + & & _ 0^ x^2(x)dx [ eq5 ] with the following notation :  & = & ( 1-i)=f(0 ) here @xmath11 is the @xmath12 total cross section , f(0 ) is the @xmath13 forward amplitude .",

    "the coulomb form factor , @xmath22 , acquire an imaginary part due to the longitudinal momentum transfer @xmath15 and the presence of the real part of the pion - nucleon elastic forward amplitude in the absorption process .",
    "the main properties of the coulomb production are : it rises from zero at zero degree angle ; reaching its maximum at @xmath23 with the specific energy dependence at the peak of @xmath24 .",
    "these properties allow one to separate the coulomb production ( primakoff process ) from the competing nuclear production in strong field of nuclei , which peaks at relatively large production angles .        for illustration , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the angular dependence of the form factors calculated by eq .",

    "the nuclear density @xmath10 was parametrized by fourier - bessel analysis from the recent electron scattering data  @xcite . as evident ,",
    "the final state interaction effects are more emphasized for the heavier nucleus , though these effects are still very small in the forward primakoff region .",
    "the photoproduction of mesons in the electromagnetic field of light nuclei requires a special consideration .",
    "equation  [ eq5 ] was obtained in the optical limit , which is valid for extended nuclear matter ( medium and heavy nuclei ) . using multiple scattering theory  @xcite",

    "p(|-| ) & = & e^- ( ) [ eq8 ] figure  [ fig4 ] shows the difference between these two approaches on the electromagnetic form factor calculations for carbon nucleus .",
    "the following parameters are used in these calculations : the proton radius @xmath31 fm ; oscillator parameter in eq .",
    "[ eq7 ] @xmath32 fm .",
    "it is seen that the form factor calculated by the `` light nuclei '' approach is falling faster at relatively large angles than that based on the `` optical limit '' .",
    "again , the difference between these two methods in the primakoff region is practically negligible .",
    "in addition to the coherent photoproduction in the coulomb field , production of pions with a nuclear collective excitation ( for instance , the giant dipole resonance ) is also possible .",
    "such processes were first discussed in  @xcite where for the inelastic form factor the following approximation was obtained : |f_n(q)|^2|t| [ eq9 ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the proton mass and the average excitation energy of the nucleus having @xmath30 protons and @xmath35 neutrons .",
    "the longitudinal momentum transfer in the case of @xmath0 photoproduction with nuclear collective excitation is much larger than in the coherent photoproduction : @xmath36 .",
    "using the fact that the ratio of the `` elastic '' to the `` inelastic '' cross sections of the @xmath0 photoproduction in the coulomb field can be estimated as : r= [ eq10 ]    for the carbon nucleus the average collective excitation energy is on the level of @xmath37 mev which , using eq .  [ eq10 ] , leads to @xmath38 in the coulomb peak region ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "thus , the contribution from the nuclear collective excitations can be safely neglected for the gev and higher incident photon energies .",
    "the main impact on the lifetime extraction from the measured differential cross sections comes from our knowledge of the strong amplitude @xmath7 in the coherent process of the reaction : + a ^0 + a [ eq11 ] in the glauber theory of multiple scattering this coherent photoproduction amplitude is given by  @xcite : t_s(q,)&= & e^i ( + z ) _",

    "the contribution from the second term is positive ( since @xmath51 ) and can be interpreted as a result of the final state interaction of the pions produced in the coherent process at nonzero angles which after multiple scattering come to forward direction . note that this correction was obtained  @xcite as in the case of electromagnetic part under the assumption that the cross sections for the incident and produced particles are equal .",
    "we have considered a more general case for the photoproduction reactions and the results are discussed in the next sections .",

    "in addition , the reaction @xmath54 is mainly caused by isospin one exchange ( @xmath52-exchange ) and the production amplitudes on protons and neutrons have different signs . since the nuclear coherent amplitude is a sum over the elementary photoproduction amplitudes the omega contribution gets an additional suppression .    using multiple scattering techniques",

    "it is interesting to mention here that at high energies where @xmath57 , assuming a validity of the naive vector dominance model ( @xmath58 ) , the above mentioned two terms cancel each other .",
