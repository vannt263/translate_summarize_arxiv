    "it was shown that in addition to commonly observed rabi splittings , plexitonic systems exhibit collective resonances at high exciton densities .",
    "such resonances correspond to collective electromagnetic modes induced by strong exciton - exciton interactions greatly enhanced by plasmons @xcite .",
    "the existence of plasmon - enhanced collective exciton modes have also been confirmed in core - shell materials @xcite . moreover using the pump - probe technique one can modify optical properties of plexitonic structures via modifications of exciton populations @xcite and efficiently control electromagnetic localization both in space and time @xcite .    using a self - consistent rigorous approach ,",

    "we note that we tested a more precise description of the dielectric function of gold using the drude - lorentz model @xcite .",
    "the results were qualitatively similar to those obtained with the drude model , i.e. all resonances discussed below were present but their energy positions were slightly different .",
    "moreover the physical nature of all resonances were the same as we checked via calculating corresponding charge distributions .",

    "we note that in such an approach the static molecule - molecule interactions are neglected thus allowing us to treat each molecule independently .",

    "the upper wire acts as a dipole antenna coupling to incident radiation .",
    "the bottom two wires support a dark mode which can not be directly excited by the external field . the dipole antenna however depending on the asymmetry parameter @xmath50 ( see the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) allows one to harvest the dark mode .",
    "the main panel shows the reflection calculated at a point near the system .",
    "it is seen from this figure that the more asymmetric the structure is the stronger the coupling between the dipole mode of the upper wire and the dark mode of the two parallel wires is .",
    "this observation is in a good agreement with main results of ref [ ] .",
    "we note that the dipole mode for the upper wire is at @xmath51 ev while in ref [ ] it is near @xmath52 ev .",
    "the discrepancy comes from the fact that in our simulations the length of each wire was set to @xmath53 nm ( as opposed to @xmath54 nm in ref [ ] ) leading to a higher energy of dipole oscillations .",
    "although a slight offset of the dipole and dark modes results in lower overall coupling since both resonances are sufficiently broad the strong coupling regime between these modes is clearly observed .",
    "the main goal of this work is to explore how the presence of resonant molecular aggregates influences coupling between bright and dark modes in the system shown in fig .",
    "we investigate two scenarios of a deposition of molecular aggregates .",
    "first ( _ geometry a _ ) is to cover the upper wire with a thin layer of resonant molecules to alter the dipole mode which in turn changes the indirect coupling between the incident field and the dark mode of the system .",
    "the second scenario ( _ geometry b _ ) is to place molecules on a surface of two parallel lower wires in order to see if a resonant molecular system can more efficiently change the coupling by interacting with the dark mode directly .",

    "the linear regime in our calculations corresponds to molecular excited state populations always much smaller than @xmath56 .",
    "results for both molecular coverages are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for the case of a molecular resonance centered at @xmath55 ev .",
    "we note several interesting observations .",
    "the arrangement corresponding to geometry a shows a clear signature of the strong coupling between molecules and the dipole mode due to strong local field enhancement as it was initially anticipated . for the symmetric orientation of the upper wire , @xmath57",
    ", one can see that the rabi splitting of the dipole resonance is about @xmath58 mev . for asymmetric cases",
    "the splitting increases reaching the value of @xmath59 mev at @xmath60 nm .",
    "it is also clear from fig .",
    "[ fig2]a that asymmetric arrangements of wires have three distinct resonant modes corresponding to two obvious hybrid exciton - plasmon modes due to the coupling between molecules and the dipole mode of the upper wire and the dark mode as expected .    in comparing our results ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) with the electromagnetic transparency window and energy storage results for the asymmetric structure in ref .",
    "[ ] , we note a reduction in intensity for both the a and b coating suppositions in our system for @xmath57 , as expected , although larger than the reduction in intensity of more than 50@xmath61 that was calculated for the strong coupling regime for the system in ref . [ ] . this has been rationalized in terms of the radiative and nonradiative decay contributions .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the case of @xmath57 , where the strong coupling with the molecular layer induces a rabi splitting , subsystem b demonstrates a blue - shift for the first peak as compared to subsystem a and the splitting is less pronounced , as is expected .",
    "this introduces another parameter that could enable modulation of the reflectance in these geometries .",
    "one may anticipate that for geometry b two lower wires covered with resonant molecules would exhibit additional interaction : molecular layer on wire @xmath56 with molecular layer on wire @xmath62 .",
    "if the coupling between these layers and either the dipole mode or the dark mode is strong the spectral response may show four resonances .",

    ", we again observe the rabi splitting but this time it is noticeably smaller , @xmath63 mev , compared to the previous case .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the molecular layers now cover two lower wires and its em coupling to the dipole mode supported by the upper wire is lower . for asymmetric arrangements",
    "there are four clearly distinctive resonances observed .",
    "this indicates the strong coupling between all four subsystems : the dipole mode of the upper wire , the quadrupole mode of the two parallel lower wires , the molecular aggregate on wire @xmath56 , and the molecular aggregate on wire @xmath62 .",

    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . both geometries a and b with the symmetric arrangement @xmath57 ( figs .",
    "[ fig3]a and [ fig3]c ) exhibit a single avoided crossing indicating the coupling between molecular aggregates and the dipole mode supported by the upper wire . once the symmetry is broken ( @xmath60 nm , figs .",
    "[ fig3]b and [ fig3]d ) a set of multiple avoided crossings appears . in the case of geometry",

    "[ fig3]d ) . at low and high molecular transition energies",
    "both molecular layers show a single resonance due to weak interaction between them .",
    "however when the molecular energy of both layers approaches the region of the strong coupling with hybrid plasmon states the degeneracy is removed and spectra show four distinct resonances .",
    "it is interesting to note that when the molecular energy is about @xmath65 ev ( close to the dark plasmon mode ) one of the molecular states is very narrow .",

    "the results of the simulations are presented in fig .",
    "the panel ( a ) shows the time dynamics of the average populations of the molecular ground state compared to a single molecule case in vacuum .",
    "one can see that the dynamics of the hybrid system is significantly different from a single emitter case - it is noticeably faster exhibiting several rabi cycles with diminishing amplitude .",
    "we note that observed faster dynamics can be explained by local field enhancement due to the excitation of a corresponding plasmon mode .",
    "higher local field increases the pump pulse area leading to more rabi cycles .",
    "another important aspect to point out is a quick decay of the amplitude of rabi oscillations . upon careful examination of spatial distributions of excited molecules",
    "one can conclude that the excitation travels fast spreading over the entire molecular layer .",
    "since the layer is not uniformly exposed to the pump this excitation is highly inhomogeneous leading to a quick dephasing of macroscopic polarization currents @xcite .",
    "another evidence to support this explanation is that the rabi splitting at the end of the pump is considerably lower compared to its unperturbed value ( for @xmath57 the splitting is @xmath76 mev for the unperturbed spectrum and is only @xmath77 mev at the end of the pump ) .",
    "the excitation spreads quickly over the entire molecular layer thus leading to a high dephasing which in turn lowers the coupling with the hybrid plasmon mode and hence affects the rabi splitting .",

    "probing the system at these times reveals that the molecular aggregate transitions into excited state .",
    "the reflection spectra calculated around @xmath80 fs exhibit a narrow resonance at the molecular transition energy @xmath65 ev as the system releases the energy it stored due to the pump .",
    "probed at later times the system shows less and less transitions occurring at @xmath65 ev as the excitation quickly dephases as seen from blue lines in figs .",

    "the latter shows that all arrangements with different asymmetry parameters result in similar time dynamics . on the contrary ,",
    "the symmetric case with @xmath57 for geometry b is considerably slower than others . probing the system with @xmath57 at different time delays @xmath74 shows basically the same trend we noted above , i.e. at the time when the average ground state population has a minimum the reflection spectrum has a sharp resonance indicating the fact that a portion of molecules is in the excited state .",

    "[ fig5]d ) we observe the strong induced fano - type resonance with the reflection becoming negligibly small at @xmath82 ev . as we anticipated in section [ linear ] while discussing avoided crossings the proximity of sharp and broad overlapping resonances may lead to strong interference resulting in fano lineshapes . here",
    "the interference is caused by the excitation of one of the hybrid molecular - plasmon states and its strong coupling with another hybrid state .",
    "we note that such a highly pronounced fano lineshape with a deep minimum in the reflection leads to high local field enhancement if being excited at the frequency corresponding to this minimum @xcite .    to illustrate how the system behaves at frequencies corresponding to very small reflection as seen in fig .",

    "it should be noted that simulations of transmission yield spectra similar to reflection with the same positions of minima and maxima .",
