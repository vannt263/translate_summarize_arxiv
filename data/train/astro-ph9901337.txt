    "interstellar dust is fairly cold , emitting in the infrared and submillimeter , and so as major observational facilities have become available at these wavelengths unique data have been gathered and great progress has been made through their analysis .",
    "i describe the basic processes involved in emission by dust and large molecules .",
    "observations of both the emission spectrum and the spatial distribution of the emission are of interest .",
    "i enumerate what data bases are available now and then turn to the `` candy shop , '' wherein one finds an enticing array of powerful new facilities that will become available within the next decade .",
    "the variety of instrumentation offers broad - band photometric information , higher resolution spectroscopy for smaller areas of the sky , and wide - field imaging with increased resolution . thus dust in a range of environments from point - like protostellar environments ,",
    "to nebulae and more diffuse emission can be studied .",
    "the emissivity of a single grain of size @xmath0 and temperature @xmath1 is @xmath2,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the efficiency factor for absorption or emission and @xmath4 is the planck function .",
    "the combination @xmath5 measures the opacity while @xmath6 determines the spectrum .",
    "appropriate integrations over the size distribution of interstellar dust are needed .    for @xmath7 , @xmath8 and so rewriting equation [ eqsingle ] @xmath9.\\ ] ]",
    "this is the origin of the statement that infrared or submillimeter emission is a measure of the total mass of dust . of course",
    ", to calibrate this one needs @xmath1 ( usually determined empirically from the broad - band spectrum ) and @xmath10 ( usually from theory , though the spectral dependence is constrained by observations ) .",
    "with multiwavelength imaging one can obtain temperature - compensated maps ( even without a perfect calibration ) of the ( relative ) spatial distribution of column density or opacity .",
    "schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) constructed high resolution all - sky maps of optical extinction @xmath11 using iras data ( at 4  resolution ) with lower resolution dirbe and h  i 21-cm emission data and colours of cluster ellipticals as steps in the calibration ( see also martin 1994 for simple limited - field application ) .",
    "grain temperature is determined by radiative energy balance between absorption and emission ( see also   [ short ] ) . in the milky way",
    "the energy density of starlight and that of the cosmic 3  k microwave background are about the same and so the radiation temperature is about 3.6  k. however , this is directly relevant only for a grain with @xmath12 , a grey or black body .",
    "grains are hotter than this because they absorb starlight ( characteristically optical and ultraviolet ) fairly efficiently ( @xmath13 ) whereas they emit inefficiently ( characteristically infrared ; @xmath14 ) ; the grains warm up , increasing @xmath4 to make up for the low @xmath3 .",
    "the equilibrium @xmath1 is the temperature for which the emission balances the absorption .",
    "a simple illustration is to assume that for all frequencies @xmath15 and that the interstellar radiation field is a blackbody of temperature @xmath16  k diluted by @xmath17 , whence @xmath18 .",
    "inserting @xmath19 gives 3.2  k , as mentioned above .",
    "inserting @xmath20 gives 16  k , very close to that observed in the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "but it should be pointed out that the latter is a coincidence ; for the sizes of grains that are actually found in the interstellar medium the spectral dependences of emission and absorption give @xmath21 closer to 2 and 0 , respectively , with offsetting effects ( the relative normalization is then important too ) .",
    "obviously , in detail @xmath1 is a function of grain size @xmath0 and composition even for the same radiation field .",
    "some useful examples are given by draine & lee ( 1984 ) .",
    "dust grains close to luminous stars are bathed in a higher than average radiation field , and so are hotter . for example , at a distance of a few pc from an o8  v star , the dust temperature is closer to 30  k. on the other hand , in the quiescent core of a molecular cloud , dust is shielded from starlight .",
    "a factor of four less radiation to be absorbed would drop the temperature by @xmath22 , from say 17 to 14  k.      where there is a bright infrared background from warm dust ( or scattered light ) , foreground cooler dust can be imaged in extinction , given sufficient opacity .",
    "because of the spectral dependence of @xmath3 , the opacity is larger at higher frequencies .",
    "a good way to assess where grains emit most of their energy is to look at a plot of @xmath23 ( or equivalently @xmath24 ) . if @xmath25 in the frequency range of emission , then from equation [ eqsingle ] , @xmath26 .",
    "this function peaks at @xmath27 for high latitude cirrus clouds with @xmath28  k , @xmath29 m ( in other units , @xmath30  @xmath31 or @xmath32  hz ) . thus iras , with the longest wavelength band at 100  @xmath33 m ( 83  120  @xmath33 m ) , still missed a substantial fraction of the energy .      iras detected widespread diffuse cirrus emission in the shorter wavelength bands , at 60 , 25 , and 12  @xmath33 m and this has been followed up with other experiments ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) .",
    "why should there be emission at @xmath34 ?",
    "the first answer is couched in terms of non - equilibrium emission by very small grains ( vsgs ) .",
    "these have such a small heat capacity that a single ultraviolet photon raises the temperature well above the equilibrium @xmath1 that would be calculated from the straightforward radiative balance described above . to be in this regime",
    ", grains must have @xmath35   , considerably smaller than classical grains ( @xmath36   ) causing optical extinction and polarization , but conceivably part of a continuous size distribution such as deduced from extinction ( kim , martin , & hendry 1994 ) .    the grains still emit according to equation [ eqsingle ] , but now @xmath1 is a function of time , initially high but decreasing in a matter of minutes through emission of infrared photons , eventually to below the equilibrium temperature . the temperature distribution has been modeled ( e.g. , guhathakurta & draine 1989 ) .",
    "vsgs are thought to be responsible for the enhanced 60 and 25  @xmath33 m emission ( see model in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) .",
    "the second answer is more often couched in terms of internal conversion of the absorbed ultraviolet radiation within large molecules , with emission in infrared spectral features ( if considered as tiny grains , then the spectral features come from the spectral dependence of @xmath3 ) .",
    "prominent in the astronomical setting are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , though the exact species are still poorly characterized .",
    "spectral measurements of widespread diffuse cirrus emission by irts and iso have shown that the 11  @xmath33 m pah feature ( see fig .  [ fig-1 ] ) accounts for a large fraction of the energy detected in the iras 12  @xmath33 m band .",
    "note that pahs emit a substantial fraction of @xmath23 , and so they must account for a corresponding fraction of the diffuse starlight absorbed .",
    "pahs are also strong emitters in photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) near hot stars where there is an abundance of ultraviolet radiation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] ) .",
    "emission at @xmath37 has been observed with the firas and dirbe experiments on cobe .",
    "early analysis suggested that there was an excess of longer wavelength emission ( @xmath38  @xmath33 m ) , attributed to a relatively cold 7  k dust component ( e.g. , dwek et al .",
    "1997 ) . despite imaginative suggestions ,",
    "there is no convincing explanation why some dust should be this cold .",
    "recent analysis by lagache et al .",
    "( 1998 ) has concluded that the 7  k dust component is spurious , resulting from analyses which neglected an isotropic far infrared background .",
    "this background has a different spectrum and causes significant contamination at long wavelengths ( they also find that the long wavelength galactic dust spectrum is consistent with @xmath39 ) .    at even lower frequencies , in the microwave range ( 15  50  ghz )",
    ", there is another excess over the thermal emission expected from dust , but which correlates with 100  @xmath33 m emission .",
    "lazarian ( this conference ; also draine & lazarian 1998 ) attributes this to emission from small spinning dust grains .",
    "this component of emission is another `` foreground , '' possibly polarized , that has to be subtracted in studying the cosmic microwave background (   [ planck ] ) .",
    "there are many sources of infrared and submillimeter data on dust .",
    "much more information that what can be given here is available via the respective web sites , a compilation of which is given below .",
