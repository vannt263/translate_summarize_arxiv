    "by charged current quasielastic scattering ( ccqe ) one usually understands the reaction in which the elementary process _",
    "l ( p ) + n(k ) l^-(k ) + p(p ) [ qe ] takes place inside the nucleus .",
    "ccqe , the largest reaction channel for @xmath2  gev , is of cardinal importance for oscillation experiments that rely on the detection of muons ( electrons ) in @xmath3 disappearance ( @xmath4 appearance ) searches .",
    "it is also the channel that can be more reliably used for a kinematical neutrino energy reconstruction , an indispensable exercise for a precise determination of oscillation parameters in long - baseline accelerator experiments .",
    "moreover , quasielastic scattering is interesting by itself and has , indeed , been carefully investigated with electron beams both experimentally and theoretically with a large variety of models  @xcite .",
    "with neutrinos it is possible to study different properties of the nuclear response in the axial sector that are not ( easily ) accessible in electron scattering experiments .",
    "provided that nuclear effects are under control , ccqe could be a source of information about the nucleon axial form factor , often parametrized as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the so called axial mass .",
    "the definition of ccqe given above already implies the assumption that the neutrino - nucleus interaction takes place predominantly on a single nucleon ( impulse approximation ) although at small momentum transfer @xmath8 ( in the laboratory frame ) , collective effects involving several nucleons should play a role . on the other side , as the excitation energy ( @xmath9 ) increases , inelastic channels _",
    "l ( p ) + n(k ) l^-(k ) + x(p ) [ inel ] with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 start to open .",
    "as these processes are not always identified experimentally ( pions can be absorbed and the nuclear products may not be all detected ) , they can not be separated from ccqe in a model independent way .",
    "the miniboone experiment , running with @xmath13  mev on a ch@xmath14 target , has collected the largest sample available so far for low energy @xmath3 ccqe  @xcite . after subtracting the non ccqe background , mainly from @xmath15 excitation , using the nuance event generator  @xcite ,",
    "the ccqe data set was analyzed with the relativistic global fermi gas model of smith and moniz ( sm )  @xcite .",
    "the shape of the muon angular and energy distributions averaged over the @xmath3 flux @xmath16 could be described with rather standard values of the fermi momentum @xmath17  mev and binding energy @xmath18  mev , but restricting the available phase space for the final proton by means of an ad hoc parameter @xmath19 such that @xmath20 , and taking @xmath21  gev  @xcite ; this value of @xmath7 is in agreement with the k2k result @xmath22  gev  @xcite on @xmath23o , but considerably higher than the one obtained from @xmath3-deuterium data @xmath24  gev  @xcite or by nomad at high energies ( 3 - 100  gev ) also on @xmath25c [ @xmath26  gev ]  @xcite .",
    "a recent reanalysis using charged current single pion production ( cc1@xmath27 ) data to adjust the monte carlo simulation employed to subtract the background obtains @xmath28 and @xmath29  gev  @xcite .",
    "while the first shape - only fit falls short compared to the measured integrated cross section  @xcite , the second one underestimates it only by 10  %  @xcite .",
    "while such a modified sm model might be convenient to parametrize the ccqe cross section using a small number of parameters , it is important to understand the miniboone ccqe data with more realistic nuclear models that implement the knowledge gathered through many years of research in electron - nucleus scattering . besides , the fact that the description changes with the background subtraction procedure indicates the need of making theoretical predictions that could be compared to ( more ) inclusive and less model dependent data .",
    "the scattering amplitude for the elementary process [ eq .  ( [ qe ] ) ] is proportional to the product of the leptonic and hadronic currents = l^j_. [ ampl ] while the charged - current leptonic current is given by the standard model , the hadronic one can be written in terms of form factors that contain the information about nucleon properties j_= |u(p ) u(p ) .",

    "( [ fa ] ) with @xmath33 ; for @xmath7 we adopt a value of 1  gev , consistent with the world data .",
    "our description of the ccqe reaction on nuclei is based on a local fermi gas model , i.e. at each space point the initial - nucleon momentum distribution is given by a fermi sphere @xmath34 with radius @xmath35^{1/3}$ ] , where @xmath36 is the empirical nuclear density",
    ". a pauli blocking factor for the final nucleon @xmath37 also applies .",
    "such a simple model already incorporates a space - momentum correlation which is absent for the global fermi gas  @xcite , and provides a framework where more elaborated many body dynamics can be naturally incorporated .",
    "in contrast to the constant binding of the sm model , here all the nucleons , initial and final , are embedded in a density and momentum dependent potential @xmath38 whose parameters have been fixed by proton - nucleus scattering data  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the nucleons acquire effective masses @xmath39 given by @xmath40 .",
    "the presence of nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions inside nuclei implies that nucleon propagators are dressed with complex selfenergies @xmath41 .",
    "this leads to spectral functions s(p ) = - .",
    "[ sf ] as most of the nucleons in the nucleus can be described as occupying single - particle states in a mean field potential  @xcite we can neglect nn interactions for the initial nucleons ( holes ) and take @xmath42 .",
    "then , @xmath43 and we recover the description of the initial state outlined in the previous paragraph . on the contrary , for the final nucleons ( particle states ) nn interactions should be considered . for this purpose in eq .",
    "( [ sf ] ) we take @xmath44 , with the collisional broadening @xmath45 fixed according to the parametrizations of the giessen boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( gibuu ) framework  @xcite . as for @xmath46 , it is obtained from @xmath47 with a once - subtracted dispersion relation demanding that at the pole @xmath48 .",
    "more details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to complete our model",
    "we take into account that inside nuclei , the strength of the electroweak couplings may change from their free nucleon values due to the presence of strongly interacting nucleons  @xcite .",
    "in the nuclear medium , the axial coupling @xmath49 is renormalized in the same way as the electric field of a dipole is screened in a dielectric medium  @xcite = , where @xmath50 is the elementary dipole susceptibility and @xmath51 the lorentz - lorenz factor whose classical value is @xmath52 .",
    "this quenching of @xmath49 in nuclear gamow - teller @xmath53 decay is well established experimentally : @xmath54  @xcite and was first applied to ccqe scattering by singh and oset  @xcite .",
    "such medium polarization effects involve several nucleons in the nucleus and are therefore important at low @xmath55 where the space resolution of the probe is large compared with the average nn separation .",
    "this corresponds to the region where miniboone data exhibit a reduction with respect to the sm model handled in the analysis by introducing the @xmath56 parameter .",
