    "granular materials settle under gravity and come to mechanical equilibrium unless an external excitation is provided .",
    "the properties of such static packings are difficult to predict , since the history of preparation of the sample is important .",
    "however , there exist different protocols to prepare a granular bed in a well defined macroscopic state . in such state ,",
    "the packing fraction ( and other macroscopic observables such as the pressure on the container ) are reproducible if the given protocol is followed .",
    "a canonical example of this is the steady states obtained by tapping the sample with a given intensity @xcite . after a suitable annealing , tapping at a constant intensity produces mechanically stable configurations ( inherent states , or microstates ) whose ensemble has well defined mean values of all macroscopic observables .    in recent years , the dependency of the steady state packing fraction , @xmath0 , on the tapping intensity , @xmath1 , has been shown to be nonmonotonic ; presenting a minimum at relatively high values of @xmath1 for disks and spheres @xcite , and a maximum at very low @xmath1 for spheres @xcite .",
    "in general , the symbol @xmath1 is used for the reduced peak acceleration given to the system during a tap .",
    "however , we will use @xmath1 in what follows to refer to any suitable parameter that characterizes the tapping intensity .    on the one hand , there exist some studies on the response to tapping of non - spherical particles @xcite , however these do not consider polygonal particles . on the other hand ,",
    "the are some investigations on polygon packings @xcite .",
    "these latter studies , however , do not focus on the steady state obtained after a repeated pulse excitation .",
    "inspired by previous works on pentagon packings @xcite , we investigate the @xmath0@xmath1 tapping curve in the steady state for monosized regular polygons with different number @xmath2 of vertices ; from triangles ( @xmath3 ) to icosagons ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "as the number of vertices grows , we expect polygon packings to approach the properties of disk packings .",
    "since depending on the number of vertices these particles may or may not tessellate the plane , we also expect strong deviations from the general trends for some grain shapes .    in this paper , we compare the general features found in the @xmath0@xmath1 curve of disk packings with those of regular polygons .",
    "although some general trends are conserved , new phenomenology emerges .",
    "in section [ simulation ] we present the simulation technique and the model particles . in section [ tesselation ]",
    "we analyze the behavior of polygons with fewer than ten vertices . in section [ transition ]",
    "we present results for polygons of up to twenty vertices .",
    "section [ fluctuations ] is devoted to the study of the density fluctuations .",
    "finally , we draw the conclusions in section [ conclusions ] and point out some interesting areas of research suggested by the new results .",
    "we perform molecular dynamic type simulations by solving the newton  euler equations of motion for rigid bodies confined on a vertical plane .",
    "gravity acts on the negative vertical direction .",
    "the bodies ( particles ) are placed in a rectangular box which is confined to move in the vertical direction .",
    "this box is high enough to avoid particles to contact the ceiling during the simulations .",
    "we prepare nineteen samples that consist of 500 monosized regular polygons of a single type ( from triangles to icosagons ) or monosized disks .",
    "particles , initially placed at random without overlaps in the box , are let to settle until they come to rest in order to prepare the initial packing .",
    "then , the same tapping protocol is applied to each sample .",
    "we set the particle  particle interactions to yield a normal restitution coefficient @xmath5 and a static and dynamic friction coefficient @xmath6 .",
    "the confining box is @xmath7 wide and @xmath8 tall ( with @xmath9 the radius of the particles ) .",
    "the particle  box friction coefficient is @xmath10 and the restitution coefficient is as in the particle ",
    "particle interaction .",
    "all polygons have the same radius and material density .",
    "therefore , the actual weight of a particle depends on the number of vertices .",
    "we use as unit mass , @xmath11 , the mass of a disk ; as unit length @xmath9 ; and the unit time is @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the acceleration of gravity .",
    "tapping is simulated by giving the box an impulse . in practice ,",
    "we set the initial velocity @xmath14 of the box ( originally at rest after deposition ) to a given positive value and restart the dynamics . in doing so , the box and its filling move upward and fall back on top of a zero restitution base . while the box dissipate all its kinetic energy on contacting the base , particles inside the box bounce against the box walls and floor until they fully settle . after all particles come to rest a new tap is applied .",
    "the intensity of the taps is measured by the initial velocity imposed to the confining box at each tap ( i.e. @xmath15 ) .",
    "a similar parameter ( the lift - off velocity ) has been recently proposed as a suitable measure of the tap intensity @xcite .",
    "the tapping protocol consist in a series of @xmath16 taps .",
    "every @xmath17 taps we change the value of @xmath1 by a small amount @xmath18",
    ". we initially decrease @xmath1 from @xmath19 down to a very low value and then increase it back to its initial high value . at each value of @xmath1",
    "the last @xmath20 taps are used to average the packing fraction in order to plot the @xmath0@xmath1 curve .",
    "the simulations were implemented by means of the box2d library @xcite .",
    "box2d uses a constraint solver to handle hard bodies . at each time step of the dynamics a series of iterations ( typically 20 )",
    "are used to resolve penetrations between bodies through a lagrange multiplier scheme @xcite . after resolving penetrations , the inelastic collision at each contact ( a contact is defined by a manifold in the case of polygons )",
    "is solved and new linear and angular velocities are assigned .",
    "the equations of motion are integrated through a symplectic euler algorithm .",
    "the time step @xmath21 used to integrate the equations of motion is @xmath22 .",
    "solid friction is also handled by means of a lagrange multiplier scheme that implements the coulomb criterion .",
    "this library achieves a high performance when handling complex bodies such as polygons .",
    "as a function of tapping intensity @xmath1 for triangles ( violet ) , squares ( red ) , pentagons ( green ) , hexagons ( blue ) , heptagons ( yellow ) , octagons ( cyan ) , nonagons ( magenta ) , and disks ( black ) . except for disks ,",
    "all curves correspond to a progressive decrease of @xmath1 followed by an increase back to high values . for disks",
    "only the decreasing part has been carried out .",
    "error bars correspond to the estimated error of the mean . ]",
    "the steady state packing fraction as a function of the tapping intensity for triangles , squares , pentagons , hexagons , heptagons , octagons and nonagons is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] alongside with the results for disks .",
    "packing fraction is estimated from the number density measured in a rectangular slab of half the packing hight at the middle of the sample .",
    "the fact that the same @xmath0-@xmath1 curve is obtained for decreasing and increasing @xmath1 indicates that these states are reversible and that @xmath0 is uniquely defined for each @xmath1 . from this results",
    "we can see that polygon packings present similar features to those observed in disk packings . at low tapping intensities , a decrease of @xmath0",
    "is observed for increasing @xmath1 down to a minimum packing fraction @xmath23 .",
    "a further increase of @xmath1 induces an increase of @xmath0 until a plateau is reached at a packing fraction somewhat lower than the maximum obtained for the lowest values of @xmath1 .",
    "disks also show a not very pronounced maximum at low @xmath1 which is not observed in polygon packings .",
    "this maximum has been recently observed in sphere packings @xcite .",
    "another overall trend is that the range of packing fractions attained by disk packings is narrower than for polygons .    beyond these general features",
    ", there are some peculiarities associated to the ability of a given polygonal shape to tessellate the plane .",
    "as is to be expected , triangles , squares and hexagons can reach packing fractions of nearly @xmath24 at the lower tapping intensities .",
    "all other shapes reach packing fractions similar to disk packings at low @xmath1 .",
    "it is important to notice at this point that our results differ from those obtained by vidales _",
    "@xcite in the case of pentagons in the framework of a pseudo - dynamic algorithm . in refs .",
    "@xcite the @xmath0@xmath1 curve does not present any minimum of the packing fraction .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we plot the minimum steady state density , @xmath23 , as a function of the number of vertices of the polygon . as the number of vertices is increased , a consistent increase of @xmath23 is found for all polygons with the exception of triangles , squares and hexagons .",
    "as we mentioned , these three polygons can tessellate the plane .",
    "correspondingly , triangles , squares and hexagons present higher densities than expected by the trend showed by all other polygons .",
    "we have seen that the position , @xmath25 , of the minimum is independent of the number of vertices .",
    "the existence of @xmath23 has been associated to a competition between arch formation and arch breaking @xcite .",
    "the position @xmath25 of such minimum signals the crossover between a regime where arches can not form due to the particles settling one by one ( in a sequential manner ) at very high @xmath1 , and a regime where arches do form but are `` melted down '' in successive taps creating a dynamic equilibrium . the fact that @xmath25 is the same for all shapes is a clear indication that arching is not favored ( nor prevented ) by any particular shape at these intermediate values of @xmath1 .     as a function of the number of vertices .",
    "the blue line is drawn only to guide the eye . ]       as a function of tapping intensity @xmath1 for nonagons , decagons , ... and icosagons .",
    "the brown data in the lower right panel correspond to disks .",

    "we now focus on the behavior of polygons with larger number of vertices ( from nonagons up to icosagons ) .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the @xmath0@xmath1 curves for each shape .",
    "one might have expected that a smooth change would appear in these curves as the number of vertices is increased up to a point where the behavior of the n - vertex polygon will converge to the one shown by disk packings . however , a sudden change is found as we move from dodecagons to triskaidecagons . while a continuous @xmath0@xmath1 curve is observed for polygons with up to @xmath26 vertices ,",
    "a sharp discontinuity in @xmath0 is present in all packings with polygons of @xmath27 vertices or more .",
    "a gap of `` forbidden '' values of @xmath0 appears between roughly @xmath28 and @xmath29 in all these polygon packings with more than @xmath26 vertices .",
    "it is important to mention that fluctuations are rather large , and configurations ( microstates ) with @xmath30 are rather common .",
    "it is the mean values that present a gap .",
    "a similar discontinuity has been seen in tapped disk packings simulated under a pseudo - dynamic algorithm @xcite .",
    "however , this is not observed in our simulations of disks ( see brown data in the lower right panel in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) nor in previous molecular dynamic simulations where the same region of @xmath1 was explored @xcite .",
    "the pseudo - dynamic algorithm @xcite conducts a deposition of disks that roll on top of each other without sliding .",
    "this might mimic , rather realistically , the behavior of regular polygons with a large number of vertices .",
    "these polygons behave like gears in the sense that they interlock very easily just as if they were infinitely rough disks .",
    "we presume this basic characteristic shared by polygons with many vertices and disk that roll without sliding is the underlying phenomenon that leads to the emergence of a discontinuous @xmath0@xmath1 curve .",
    "we mention in pass that , although it is difficult to relate with the static packings studied here , a similar discontinuity has been reported in an oscillation experiment of a 2d granular sample @xcite .    in order to have a rough indication of the nature of the transition",
    ", we have made a more detailed simulation for tetrakaidecagons ( @xmath31 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the steady state value of @xmath0 is plotted for @xmath1 in the interval @xmath32 $ ] with a smaller @xmath18 step . in panel ( a ) , we plot two independent experiments obtained by increasing @xmath1 alongside with the corresponding results from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( where a larger @xmath18 was used ) .",
    "the results for the reversed protocol in which @xmath1 is decreased is presented in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , the system seems to present a first order type transition where metastable branches are explored .",
    "since fluctuations are rather large for this small system sizes , the system may explore microstates compatible with both `` coexisting '' phases . nevertheless , in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , where the protocol corresponds to decreasing @xmath1 , the transition looks much smoother if the rate @xmath18 is reduced .",
    "although the data is noisy , we can see that the width of transition region is rate dependent .",
    "density fluctuations have recently received renewed interest as a way to measure configurational temperature ( as defined by edwards @xcite ) and entropy @xcite .",
    "it was in a fluidization experiment that a nonmonotonic dependence of the fluctuations @xmath33 as a function of @xmath0 in the steady state was first reported @xcite . in that work ,",
    "et al . _ found a minimum in the density fluctuations for spheres .",
    "however , a recent study on disks reported a maximum in fluctuations from both , experiments and simulations @xcite .     of the packing fraction in the steady state as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the red line is a simple running average to guide the eye .",
    "the arrows indicate the direction of increasing @xmath1 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the steady state density fluctuations @xmath33 as measured by the standard deviation as a function of @xmath0 for several polygons and disks .",
    "the results for disks are entirely in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite . a clear maximum in @xmath33 appears for disks .",
    "one can also see that states of equal @xmath0 at each side of @xmath23 present slightly different fluctuations .",
    "this indicates that these states are not equivalent and that @xmath0 is not sufficient to characterize the macroscopic state .",
    "a more detailed analysis of this can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite where the force moment tensor is found to be a suitable extra macroscopic variable in accordance with theoretical suggestions @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the density fluctuations in the polygon packings show the signal of the transition for shapes with @xmath34 .",
    "however the same general trends as those seen for disks are observed .",
    "interestingly , a peculiar behavior appears for triangles , squares and pentagons .",
    "pentagons present the same fluctuations at both sides of the @xmath0 minimum whereas triangles and squares present a reversed situation where fluctuations are larger for large @xmath1 , instead of smaller as seen in all other shapes .",
    "this change in trend should have an important impact in the calculation of configurational temperature and entropy .",
    "we will pursue this point further elsewhere .",
    "we have carried out simulations of the tapping of assemblies of regular polygonal grains and studied the steady state of such systems .",
    "the comparison with more widely studied disk packings has shown some general similarities but also remarkable new phenomenology .",
    "on the one hand , beyond the expectable result for triangles , squares and hexagons that cover the space if gently tapped , polygons with @xmath34 show a sharp transition with a clear density gap . on the other hand , triangles and squares present density fluctuations that are larger at large tapping intensities in contrast with all other shapes ( including disks ) .",
    "a number of questions arise from this study that can lead future research .",
    "some of these questions are :    1 .",
    "what is the true nature of the transition for polygons with a large number of vertices ? can this transition be effectively found in infinite rough disks ? can the low density coexisting phase be related with the so called _ random close packing",
    "_ state @xcite .",
    "2 .   given that fluctuations have a different trend , is the granular ( configurational ) temperature in the case of triangles and squares radically different from that of other shape packings ?",
    "3 .   given that for pentagons the fluctuations are equivalent for states at each side of @xmath23 obtained with different @xmath1 , which suggest that the states are equivalent , is the force moment tensor equivalent ?",
