    "this does not influence the explicit factor @xmath163 within @xmath164 , which is defined in the on - shell scheme .",
    "] we choose the fundamental susy mass parameters for the higgsino , wino , left- and right - handed smuon equal , @xmath165 only the bino mass parameter is determined by the gut relation @xmath166 , and @xmath160 .",
    "the exact result for the ratio of the photonic corrections to the one - loop result is denoted by the continuous line . for comparison",
    "we also show the leading - log result , which , without further knowledge , can only be computed with @xmath167 in a reasonable range .",
    "we choose @xmath168 in the range between the minimum and maximum of the mass eigenvalues @xmath169 , @xmath170 and represent the result by the grey band .",
    "[ fig : equalmasses]b shows a similar plot where @xmath171  gev fixed and @xmath172 are varied .    not surprisingly , owing to the additional negative non - logarithmic contributions the exact result lies outside the band for the leading - log estimate .",
    "the leading - log result approximates the exact result best if we choose @xmath167 as the maximum of all susy masses ( because of the negative sign , this corresponds to the lower border of the band ) .    in order to understand the behaviour of the mssm result in more detail",
    "it is important to note that the mssm contributions are enhanced by @xmath24 , but this enhancement only affects the terms involving @xmath77 ; hence the @xmath76-terms are comparatively unimportant .",
    "the @xmath24-enhanced terms can be well approximated by mass - insertion diagrams @xcite , with propagating gauginos and higgsinos and insertions of the off - diagonal entries of the chargino / neutralino mass matrices .",
    "this implies that in the sums over mass eigenstates in ( [ amususy1l ] ) , ( [ amususyphot ] ) , intricate cancellations take place .",

    "our results have been presented in such a way that they can be easily utilized as building blocks in a full calculation of all two - loop corrections to @xmath161 in the mssm .",
    "this is useful because two technical problems are concentrated in the photonic corrections : the appearance of ir divergences and of terms which are not suppressed by powers of @xmath87 divided by a heavy mass of the order of the weak scale or susy scale .    as discussed in secs .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] , [ sec : oneloop ] , the susy two - loop corrections to sm one - loop diagrams are already known .",

    "these contributions are defined as the two - loop diagrams where the @xmath36-lepton number is carried by a @xmath35 and/or @xmath33 line , plus corresponding counterterm diagrams .",

    "hence we can write @xmath188 where the appropriate summation over the chargino , neutralino and smuon indices of each term is implied .    setting up the full calculation in this way has several technical advantages .",

    "only the non - photonic two - loop diagrams need to be evaluated . as an advantage",

    "* the difference of the qed counterterm diagrams ( 3rd line of eq .",
    "( [ fullsetup ] ) ) vanishes .",
    "the reason is that the appearing qed counterterm insertions and renormalization constants , see eq .",
    "( [ qedrentransf ] ) , have to be defined in the same way , in the on - shell scheme , in the full theory and for the photonic corrections .",
    "therefore , the qed counterterm diagrams , which are again partially infrared divergent , need not be re - evaluated in the full calculation .",
    "all counterterm diagrams that remain to be calculated are individually infrared finite and suppressed by @xmath83 divided by a heavy mass squared .",
    "the only subtlety arises in the 4th line of eq .",
    "( [ fullsetup ] ) , in connection with the susy counterterm diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : ctsusy ] .",
    "the renormalization constants ( [ susyrentransf ] ) appearing within these diagrams are different in the full mssm and in our calculation . in the full theory , @xmath189",
    "must also be defined in the on - shell scheme , but further diagrams contribute to it .",
    "mass and field renormalization constants for the neutral particles do not vanish any more .",
    "finally , for the susy masses and couplings not even the same renormalization scheme can be used in the full theory.u(1 ) gauge invariance implies correlations between the susy masses and the different couplings @xmath124 , which must be reflected in the renormalization scheme , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "but they can not be reflected in the purely photonic corrections since these are not invariant under the full symmetry of the mssm . ]    nevertheless , it is possible to choose any desired mssm renormalization scheme and to compute the full mssm counterterm diagrams @xmath190 in that scheme .",
    "then simply our counterterm result @xmath110 , which has been given in eq .",
    "( [ amuctsusy ] ) , has to be explicitly subtracted .",
    "the choice of the regularization scheme dreg or dred for the counterterms has to match the choice for the two - loop diagrams . in this way",
    ", the full result corresponding to the desired mssm renormalization scheme is obtained . as discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : cts ] , @xmath190 will contain the same large qed logarithm arising from @xmath191 within the susy coupling renormalization that is already contained in @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , the difference in the 4th line of eq .",
    "( [ fullsetup ] ) is free of large qed logarithms .",
    "in the present paper the photonic two - loop corrections to the muon magnetic moment @xmath9 in the mssm and a wider class of models have been evaluated exactly .",
    "the photonic corrections are defined as the two - loop diagrams which contain a photon loop attached to a susy one - loop diagram , plus the corresponding counterterm diagrams .",
    "the counterterms are defined in the `` on - shell muon mass scheme '' , which is natural for the models considered here and in ref .",

    "our result reproduces the large logarithms of ref .",
    "@xcite and provides the exact result for the additional subleading logarithms , dilogarithms and non - logarithmic terms .",
    "the leading logarithm has an intrinsic uncertainty because it could be evaluated with a small , large , or intermediate susy mass .",
    "for the typical susy scenarios considered here , the leading logarithm amounts to around @xmath192 of @xmath193 if the smallest susy mass is used ; the additional terms are in the range @xmath194 and thus typically lead to a further reduction of @xmath161 . however ,",
    "for large @xmath36 , the additional terms can have a positive sign and can partially compensate the leading logarithm .",
    "it is interesting to compare the photonic two - loop corrections to other known susy two - loop contributions to the muon magnetic moment .",
    "another universal two - loop correction is the @xmath28-correction arising from a shift of the muon yukawa coupling @xcite . in a large part of the mssm parameter space , particularly for approximately degenerate susy masses , the photonic and the @xmath28-corrections are the largest two - loop effects . while the photonic corrections are negative , the @xmath28-corrections are positive ( for positive @xmath193 ) and can overcompensate the photonic corrections for large @xmath24 .",
    "the susy two - loop corrections to standard model one - loop diagrams @xcite amount to around @xmath195 of @xmath193 for degenerate masses , but in special cases with large mass splittings or in cases where the one - loop contributions are suppressed , they can become dominant .",
    "importantly , with the exact two - loop computation the theory error arising from unknown photonic corrections has been reduced . the remaining theory error due to unknown photonic three - loop corrections",
    "can be estimated by comparing with the electroweak contributions in the standard model . there , the photonic three - loop corrections amount to only @xmath196 of the photonic two - loop corrections . based on that , we can estimate the unknown photonic three - loop corrections to @xmath161 to be less than @xmath197 and thus negligible .    nevertheless , in order to make full use of the expected and intended improvements of @xmath14 and @xmath198 for susy phenomenology , the susy theory error should be further reduced .",
    "our calculation can also help in computing the remaining susy two - loop contributions to @xmath9 . if the full calculation is organized as in eq .",
    "( [ fullsetup ] ) , only non - photonic diagrams and non - qed counterterm diagrams remain to be computed .",
    "these are all infrared finite and suppressed by the required @xmath83 factor and contain no further large qed - logarithm .",
