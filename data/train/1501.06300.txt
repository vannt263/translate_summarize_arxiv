    "transmission of information in broadband optical waveguide links can be significantly enhanced by launching many pulse sequences through the same waveguide @xcite . each pulse sequence propagating through the waveguide",
    "is characterized by the central frequency of its pulses , and is therefore called a frequency channel .",
    "applications of these multichannel systems , which are also known as wavelength - division - multiplexed ( wdm ) systems , include fiber optics transmission lines @xcite , data transfer between computer processors through silicon waveguides @xcite , and multiwavelength lasers @xcite . since pulses from different frequency channels propagate with different group velocities , interchannel pulse collisions are very frequent , and can therefore lead to error generation and cause severe transmission degradation @xcite .    in the current paper , we study pulse propagation in broadband multichannel optical fiber systems with @xmath0 frequency channels , considering optical solitons as an example for the pulses .",
    "the two main processes affecting interchannel soliton collisions in these systems are due to the fiber s instantaneous nonlinear response ( kerr nonlinearity ) and delayed raman response",
    ". the only effects of kerr nonlinearity on a single interchannel collision between two isolated solitons in a long optical fiber are a phase shift and a position shift , which scale as @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , where @xmath4 is the difference between the frequencies of the colliding solitons @xcite .",
    "thus , in this long fiber setup , the amplitude , frequency , and shape of the solitons do not change due to the collision .",
    "however , the situation changes , once the finite length of the fiber and the finite separation between the solitons are taken into account @xcite . in this case",
    ", the collision leads to emission of small amplitude waves ( continuous radiation ) with peak power that is also inversely proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "the emission of continuous radiation in many collisions in an @xmath0-channel transmission system can eventually lead to pulse - shape distortion and as a result , to transmission destabilization @xcite .",
    "the main effect of delayed raman response on single - soliton propagation in an optical fiber is an @xmath5 frequency downshift , where @xmath6 is the raman coefficient @xcite .",
    "this raman - induced self frequency shift is a result of energy transfer from high frequency components of the pulse to lower frequency components .",
    "the main effect of delayed raman response on an interchannel two - soliton collision is an @xmath5 amplitude shift , which is called raman - induced crosstalk @xcite .",
    "it is a result of energy transfer from the high frequency pulse to the low frequency one .",
    "the amplitude shift is accompanied by an @xmath7 collision - induced frequency downshift ( raman cross frequency shift ) and by emission of continuous radiation @xcite .",
    "note that the raman - induced amplitude shift in a single collision is independent of the magnitude of the frequency difference between the colliding solitons .",
    "consequently , the cumulative amplitude shift experienced by a given pulse in an @xmath0-channel transmission line is proportional to @xmath8 , a result that is valid for linear transmission @xcite , conventional soliton transmission @xcite , and dispersion - managed soliton transmission @xcite . thus , in a 100-channel system , for example , raman crosstalk effects are larger by a factor of @xmath9 compared with a two - channel system operating at the same bit rate per channel .",
    "for this reason , raman - induced crosstalk is considered to be one of the most important processes affecting the dynamics of optical pulse amplitudes in broadband fiber optics transmission lines @xcite .",
    "the first studies of raman crosstalk in multichannel fiber optics transmission focused on the dependence of the energy shifts on the total number of channels @xcite , as well as on the impact of energy depletion and group velocity dispersion on amplitude dynamics @xcite .",
    "later studies turned their attention to the interplay between bit - pattern randomness and raman crosstalk in on - off - keyed ( ook ) transmission , and showed that this interplay leads to lognormal statistics of pulse amplitudes @xcite .",
    "this finding means that the @xmath10th normalized moments of the probability density function ( pdf ) of pulse amplitudes grow exponentially with both propagation distance and @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , in studies of soliton - based multichannel transmission , it was found that the @xmath10th normalized moments of the pdfs of the raman self and cross frequency shifts also grow exponentially with propagation distance and @xmath11 @xcite . the exponential growth of the normalized moments of pulse parameter pdfs can be interpreted as intermittent dynamics , in the sense that the statistics of the amplitude and frequency is very sensitive to bit - pattern randomness @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that this intermittent dynamics has important practical consequences in massive multichannel transmission , by leading to relatively high bit - error - rate values at intermediate and large propagation distances .",
    "additionally , the different scalings and statistics of raman - induced and kerr - induced effects lead to loss of scalability in these systems @xcite .",
    "one of the ways to overcome the detrimental effects of raman crosstalk on massive ook multichannel transmission is by employing encoding schemes , which are less susceptible to these effects .",
    "the phase shift keying ( psk ) scheme , in which the information is encoded in the phase difference between adjacent pulses , is among the most promising encoding methods , and has thus become the focus of intensive research @xcite . since in psk transmission",
    "the information is encoded in the phase , the amplitude patterns are deterministic , and as a result , the raman - induced amplitude dynamics is also approximately deterministic .",
    "a key question about this deterministic dynamics concerns the possibility to achieve stable steady - state transmission with nonzero predetermined amplitude values in all channels . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was demonstrated that this is not possible in unamplified optical fiber lines . however , the experiments in refs .",
    "@xcite showed that the situation is very different in amplified multichannel transmission .",
    "more specifically , it was found that the introduction of amplification enables transmission stabilization and significant reduction of the cumulative raman crosstalk effects . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we provided a dynamical explanation for the stabilization of psk soliton - based multichannel transmission , by demonstrating that the raman - induced amplitude shifts can be balanced by an appropriate choice of amplifier gain in different channels .",
    "our approach was based on showing that the collision - induced dynamics of soliton amplitudes in an @xmath0-channel system can be described by a relatively simple @xmath0-dimensional predator - prey model .",
    "furthermore , we obtained the lyapunov function for the predator - prey model and used it to show that stable transmission with nonzero amplitudes in all channels can be realized by overamplification of high frequency channels and underamplification of low frequency channels .",
    "all the results in ref .",
    "@xcite were obtained with the @xmath0-dimensional predator - prey model , which is based on several simplifying assumptions , whose validity might break down with increasing number of channels or at large propagation distances . in particular",
    ", the predator - prey model neglects high - order effects due to radiation emission , intrasequence interaction , and temporal inhomogeneities .",
    "these effects can lead to pulse shape distortion and eventually to transmission destabilization ( see , for example , ref .",
    "the distortion of the solitons shapes can also lead to the breakdown of the predator - prey model description at large distances .",
    "for example , the relation between the onset of pulse pattern distortion and the breakdown of the simplified model for dynamics of pulse amplitude was noted ( but not quantified ) in studies of crosstalk induced by nonlinear gain or loss @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the complete propagation model , which consists of a system of @xmath0 perturbed coupled nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations , fully incorporates the effects of radiation emission , intrachannel interaction , and temporal inhomogeneities .",
    "thus , in order to check whether stable long - distance multichannel transmission can indeed be realized by a proper choice of linear amplifier gain , it is important to carry out numerical simulations with the full coupled - nls model .    in the current paper , we take on this important task . for this purpose ,",
    "we employ perturbed coupled - nls models , which take into account the effects of second - order dispersion , kerr nonlinearity , delayed raman response , and frequency dependent linear gain - loss .",
    "we perform numerical simulations with the coupled - nls models with @xmath1 frequency channels for two main transmission setups . in the first setup ,",
    "the soliton sequences propagate through a single optical fiber , while in the second setup , the sequences propagate through a waveguide coupler .",
    "we then analyze the simulations results in comparison with the predictions of the predator - prey model of ref .",
    "@xcite , looking for processes leading to transmission stabilization and destabilization .",
    "the coupled - nls simulations for single - fiber transmission show that at short - to - intermediate distances soliton amplitudes exhibit stable oscillatory dynamics , in excellent agreement with the predator - prey model s predictions .",
    "these results mean that radiation emission and intrachannel interaction effects can indeed be neglected at short - to - intermediate distances .",
    "however , at larger distances , we observe transmission destabilization due to formation of radiative sidebands , which is caused by the effects of kerr nonlinearity on interchannel soliton collisions .",
    "we also find that the radiative sidebands for the @xmath12th soliton sequence form near the frequencies @xmath13 of the solitons in the neighboring frequency channels .",
    "additionally , we find that the presence of frequency dependent linear gain - loss in a single fiber leads to a moderate increase in the distance along which stable transmission is observed .",
    "the limited enhancement of transmission stability in a single fiber is explained by noting that in this case one can not employ strong linear loss at the frequencies of the propagating solitons , and therefore , one can not efficiently suppress the formation of the radiative sidebands .",
    "a stronger enhancement of transmission stability might be achieved in a nonlinear waveguide coupler , consisting of @xmath0 nearby waveguides .",
    "indeed , in this case one might expect to achieve a more efficient suppression of radiative sideband generation by employing relatively strong linear loss outside of the central amplification frequency interval for each of the @xmath0 waveguides in the waveguides coupler . to test this prediction ,",
    "we carry out numerical simulations with the coupled - nls model for propagation in the waveguide coupler .",
    "the coupled - nls simulations show that transmission stability and the validity of the predator - prey model s predictions in the waveguide coupler system are extended to significantly larger distances compared with the distances in the single - fiber system .",
    "furthermore , the simulations for the waveguide coupler show that no radiative sidebands form throughout the propagation . based on these observations",
    "we conclude that the enhanced transmission stability in the waveguide coupler is a result of the efficient suppression of radiative sideband generation by the frequency dependent linear gain - loss in this setup .",
    "we consider optical solitons as an example for the pulses carrying the information for the following reasons .",
    "first , due to the integrability of the unperturbed nls equation and the shape - preserving property of nls solitons , derivation of the predator - prey model for raman - induced amplitude dynamics is done in a rigorous manner @xcite .",
    "second , the soliton stability and shape - preserving property make soliton - based transmission in broadband fiber optics links advantageous compared with other transmission methods @xcite .",
    "third , as mentioned above , the raman - induced energy exchange in pulse collisions is similar in linear transmission , conventional soliton transmission , and dispersion - managed soliton transmission .",
    "thus , even though pulse dynamics in these different transmission systems is different , analysis of soliton - based transmission stabilization and destabilization might give a rough idea about the processes leading to stabilization and destabilization of the optical pulse sequences in other transmission setups .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ models ] , we present the coupled - nls model for @xmath0-channel transmission in a single fiber together with the @xmath0-dimensional predator - prey model for raman - induced dynamics of pulse amplitudes .",
