    "in this paper we give an application of a discrete notion of homotopy theory ( @xmath3-theory hereafter ) to subspace arrangements , which yields an unexpected connection between word problems on the symmetric group and the computation of the first betti number of the @xmath4-equal arrangement in @xmath5 .",
    "more importantly , in order to compute those betti numbers we were led to introduce new combinatorial techniques for evaluating the rank of the discrete fundamental group of the 1-skeleton of the permutahedron .",
    "it is those techniques that we believe will be useful for computing the discrete fundamental group of the 1-skeleton of other polytopes .    since the early 1980 s",
    ", subspace arrangements have been extensively studied both by topologists and combinatorialists .",
    "one of the reasons for such activities is the fact that certain complexity theory problems arising in computer science have a reformulation in terms of subspace arrangements , thus yielding a beautiful interaction between combinatorics , topology , geometry , and complexity theory .",
    "bjrner gives a nice account of this interaction in @xcite and @xcite .    on the other hand , @xmath3-theory is a recently introduced notion of discrete homotopy theory for graphs and simplicial complexes that was originally developed , in the mid 90 s , in the context of social and technological networks .",
    "see @xcite for a survey of this topic , and @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , for applications .",
    "more recently , dochtermann introduced a different notion of homotopy of graph maps .",
    "his notion is based on the categorical product of graphs rather than on the cartesian product .",
    "for a nice account of the relation between these two notions of homotopy see @xcite and @xcite .    in 2001 , babson @xcite ( and independently bjrner @xcite ) proved that the discrete fundamental @xmath3-group , @xmath6 of the order complex of the boolean lattice is isomorphic to the fundamental group , @xmath7 of the complement , @xmath8 of the real @xmath1-equal arrangement .",
    "namely , @xmath9 where @xmath10 with    @xmath11    in @xcite , bjrner and welker showed that in fact the cohomology groups , @xmath12 of the complement of the @xmath4-equal arrangements are free .",
    "furthermore , they give formulae for some of the non - vanishing rank of the cohomology groups . from these formulae",
    "one can deduce that the first betti number for the ( real ) complement of the @xmath1-equal arrangement is equal to @xmath13 their proof is quite intricate and relies on the goresky - macpherson and the ziegler - ivaljevi formulae and on some combinatorial methods for computing the homotopy type of partially ordered sets .",
    "a different approach , based on non - pure shellability of the lattice @xmath14 ( the lattice of intersections of the subspaces associated with the @xmath4-equal arrangement ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "because of the above isomorphism ( [ iso ] ) , one realizes that computing the rank of the abelianization of @xmath15 will also yield the first betti number of @xmath16 we show here how to compute this rank using only combinatorial arguments on @xmath17 the @xmath0-skeleton of the permutahedron , a graph that @xmath3-theory associates with @xmath18 as it turns out , every discrete homotopy argument can be reformulated in terms of word problems for the symmetric group @xmath19 making the arguments simple and , we hope , shedding new light on the theory of subspace arrangements .    in section @xmath20 we review the fundamental notions of @xmath3-theory that are needed throughout this article . in a nutshell ,",

    "a graph @xmath24 is constructed .",
    "next , viewing @xmath24 as a @xmath0-dimensional simplicial complex , one attaches @xmath25-cells to all of its @xmath1 and @xmath26-cycles , after which it suffices to compute the fundamental group of this @xmath25-cell complex . in practice",
    ", one is left to count the number of equivalence classes ( under an appropriate equivalence relation ) of cycles of @xmath24 of length at least 5 , which is equal to @xmath27 when the group is free .    in the case of the order complex of the boolean lattice ,",
    "@xmath28 the associated graph is @xmath29 the @xmath30 vertices of @xmath31 can be identified with the permutations of the symmetric group @xmath19 and there is an edge between two permutations @xmath32 and @xmath33 if there exists a simple transposition , @xmath34 such that @xmath35 note , we multiply permutations from right to left . moreover , in order to compute the rank of @xmath36 it will suffice to find the number of equivalence classes of @xmath37-cycles in @xmath31 .",
    "note that in @xmath31 every _ primitive _ @xmath37-cycle ( one that is not the concatenation of two @xmath26-cycles ) can be associated with a pair of consecutive simple transpositions @xmath38 and @xmath39 while the permutahedron is a well studied polytope ( see for e.g. @xcite ) , some of the properties needed to compute the above mentioned rank come to light when we realize that @xmath31 can be obtained by taking the cartesian product of smaller graphs and then removing some of the edges .",
    "the crux of the argument relies on the fact that the maximal chains of the direct product of two graded posets @xmath40 can be expressed as a shuffle of maximal chains from @xmath41 and @xmath42 the various constructions involved are described in sections [ s : general graph ] and [ s : graph ] . for greater details",

    "if @xmath32 is a permutation of a @xmath37-cycle , and @xmath401 is the corresponding maximal chain of @xmath164 , then the maximal chain @xmath402 corresponding to the permutation @xmath403 differs from @xmath401 in exactly two levels . hence , the permutations @xmath32 and @xmath403 are adjacent in @xmath400 as their corresponding simplices share an @xmath404-face .",
