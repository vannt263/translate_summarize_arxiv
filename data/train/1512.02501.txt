    ". moreover , the results in the feynman and contour gauges coincide if the gluon poles in the correlators @xmath0 are absent .",
    "this is in agreement with the relation between gluon poles and the sivers function which corresponds to the `` leading twist '' dirac matrix @xmath3 .",
    "this also suggests that the gluonic poles appear only in `` physical '' components of gluon field , coinciding with total ones in the axial gauge .",
    "we study the semi - inclusive process where the hadron with the transverse polarization collides with the other unpolarized hadron to produce the direct photon in the final state in : @xmath4 for ( [ process ] ) ( also for the drell - yan process ) , the gluonic poles manifest .",
    "we perform our calculations within a _ collinear _ factorization and , therefore , it is convenient to fix the dominant light - cone directions as @xmath5 accordingly , the quark and gluon momenta @xmath6 and @xmath7 lie along the plus dominant direction while the gluon momentum @xmath8  along the minus direction .",
    "the final on - shell photon and quark(anti - quark ) momenta can be presented as @xmath9 and , the mandelstam variables for the process and subprocess are defined as @xmath10 the amplitude ( or the hadron tensor ) of ( [ process ] ) constructed by the contributions from ( i ) the leading ( lo ) in particle number diagrams : two diagrams with a radiation of the photon before ( @xmath11 ) and after ( @xmath12 ) the quark - gluon vertex with the gluon going to the lower blob , see the right side of fig .",

    ", we have to conclude that the only remaining third term in ( [ dy - st ] ) should not contribute to ssa .",
    "moreover , we can conclude that , in the case with the substantial transverse component of the momentum , there are no any sources for the gluon pole at @xmath59 . as a result , the function @xmath60 has no gluon poles and , due to t - invariance , @xmath61 , obeys @xmath62 . on the other hand ,",

    "the different prescriptions in the gluonic poles .",
    "moreover , the different prescriptions are needed to ensure the qcd gauge invariance .",

    "we find that the  non - standard \" new terms , which exist in the case of the complex twist-@xmath2 @xmath68-function with the corresponding prescriptions , do contribute to the hadron tensor exactly as the  standard \" term known previously .",
    "this is another important result of our work .",
    "we also observe that this is exactly similar to the case of drell - yan process studied in @xcite .",
    "we argue the absence of gluon poles in the correlators @xmath0 based on the light - cone dynamics . at the same time",
    ", we also show that the lorentz and qed gauge invariance of the hadron tensor calculated within the feynman gauge requires the function @xmath60 to be without any gluon poles .",
    "this property seems to be natural from the point of view of gluon poles relation @xcite to sivers functions as the latter is related to the projection @xmath3 .",
    "note also that this may be understood as appearance of gluonic poles due to the physical components @xcite of gluonic fields .",
