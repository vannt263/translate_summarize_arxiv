    "the influence of galactic structures , namely spiral arms and galactic bars , on star formation and natal molecular clouds has long been a topic under active debate .",
    "discussions in this context often assume that galactic structures are quasi - stationary density waves ( dws ) @xcite , which are stationary over galactic rotations .",
    "the response of gas clouds to stationary dw perturbations has been investigated in detail , both for spiral arms ( e.g. , @xcite ) and bars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and these models are collectively referred to as the `` galactic shock '' model .    within the picture of the stationary dw and the galactic shock models ,",
    "gas clouds are continuously swept by the arm / bar , and these clouds subsequently form stars at an enhanced rate due to cloud - to - cloud collisions ( e.g. , @xcite ) and/or large - scale instabilities ( e.g. , @xcite ) . these effects should produce two observable signs , which can be tested by molecular - line observations . the first is the systematic offsets between molecular gas and star forming ( sf ) regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the second is the enhancement of star formation efficiency ( sfe ) , which is defined as the star formation rate ( sfr ) per unit molecular gas mass , in the arm / bar compared to the interarm regions .",
    "an alternative possibility has been also proposed for the case of bars ( which is discussed later ) .",
    "meanwhile , it has been recognized that at least some fraction of the spiral arms is not steady .",
    "for example , a spiral arm which relies on swing amplification @xcite or self - propagating star formation @xcite should be non - steady in nature .",
    "a non - steady arm behaves as material arm that winds up with time @xcite , and as a consequence of the co - moving of gas clouds and stars , produces neither ordered co - sf offsets nor strong enhancement of sfe .",
    "thus , testing the two observable signs of the dw and the galactic shock models is of importance to interpret the nature of galactic structures .    thus far , observational verifications of the two abovementioned signs have been carried out mainly for spiral arms . for the co - sf offsets , certain studies have indeed reported systematic offsets in grand design spiral galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , later , with an increase in the number of observed samples , it is recognized that not all the galaxies show such offsets @xcite .",
    "compelling results as regards sfe enhancement also exist .",
    "although early works have reported elevated sfe in spiral arms @xcite , more recently , by comparing co ( 21 ) and sfr traced using 24-@xmath9 m and far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) images , @xcite showed that the arm - to - interarm variation in sfe is difficult to identify even in grand design spiral galaxies .",
    "compared to the number of tests performed for spiral arms , that for bars still remains small . in a bar ,",
    "the situation is complicated by the presence of highly non - circular motion .",
    "analyses of the co - sf offsets in bars reported that to properly interpret the patterns of the offsets , detailed modeling of the gas kinematics is required @xcite , compared to the cases in spiral arms .",
    "moreover , it has been also argued that shear motion induced by the non - circular motion may stabilize clouds and lower the sfe , contrary to the case in spiral arms ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent observational results concerning spiral arms that are not in agreement with the expectations of the classic dw and the galactic shock models @xcite might be attributed to the non - steady nature of spiral arms ( e.g. , @xcite ) . within this context",
    ", bars are important targets for comparison with spiral arms , because they are in general considered to be long - lived compared to the arms , and thus , researchers can expect to observe the signs of the stationary dw , i.e. the co - sf offsets and the sfe enhancement .",

    "recent studies on the schmidt ",
    "kennicutt ( sk ) law also indicate a similar conjecture ; removing the diffuse background from the sfr tracer images leads to a significant increase in the index of the sk - law @xcite .",
    "therefore , the discrepancies between the early studies that report sfe enhancement via h@xmath6 images @xcite and recent studies that report the absence of sfe enhancement using 24@xmath9 m imaging @xcite may be attributed to the issue of the background removal .",
    "the @xmath0co ( 10 ) map of the nearby galaxy m83 generated by observation with the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) is presented . to correct for the lack of the nma s sensitivity to diffuse emission ,",
    "the interferometric data are combined with the data obtained using the nobeyama 45-m telescope .",
    "the target field of the nma observations consists of 46 pointings , and it covers the entire extent of the molecular bar and also sections of the spiral arms . by exploiting the resultant higher angular resolution and sensitivity to extended co emission , the influence of the galactic structures on the molecular gas content is investigated in terms of the gas kinematics and the relation between molecular gas and star formation .    * the total - flux - recovered map has a spatial resolution of @xmath1110 pc @xmath2 260 pc , and it clearly resolves galactic structures including the bar and the spiral arms .",
    "several interarm clouds with counterparts in the optical images as dust lanes are also detected .",
    "* the position - velocity diagram along the major axis is strongly influenced by non - circular motion induced by the bar . by exploiting the fact that gas streams along the offset ridges and the bar are seen side - on , the pattern speed of the bar ( @xmath56 ) is determined to be 57.4 @xmath3 2.8 km s@xmath4 kpc@xmath4 . * to check the validity of @xmath56 , a simple hydrodynamical simulation is performed to examine the hydrodynamical response of the gas disk . in the simulation ,",
    "the stellar mass distribution is fixed , and it is calculated from the @xmath37-band image . by comparing the hydrodynamical model predictions with the observed co data in terms of the kinematics , the adopted @xmath56 value is found to be in agreement with the observed data . *",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) is derived from the linear combination of the h@xmath6 and the 24-@xmath9 m images .",
    "diffuse background emission not related to recent massive star formation is estimated and removed from each image . for the h@xmath6 image , hii regions are identified and removed and subsequently then , background emission is estimated from the residual using the hiiphot code . for the 24@xmath9-m image , hii region identification is performed using the smoothed h@xmath6 image that has a resolution identical to that of the 24-@xmath9 m image , and subsequently , by using the detected hii region boundaries as a reference mask , the background 24-@xmath9 m emission is estimated .",
    "*   the luminosity function ( lf ) of the hii regions identified from the h@xmath6 image follows a power - law distribution , exhibiting a break at l(h@xmath6 ) = 10@xmath5 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "a similar break in the hii lf has been observed for other galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the hii regions brighter than the threshold are likely powered by associations of o and b stars , and these bright hii regions are found to be located downstream of the molecular bar / arms . *   azimuthal angular offsets between co and h@xmath6 emission and between co and 24-@xmath9 m images",
    "are detected using the angular cross - correlation method .",
    "the sfr tracers are preferentially located downstream of the co within the observed region ( @xmath90 ) that not only encompasses the bar but also the inner spiral arms .",
    "since the pattern speed derived in the text places cr as being located 141@xmath314@xmath15 away from the center , it is not inconsistent . by comparing the amount of the offsets with gas cloud orbits calculated from the stellar potential of m83",
    ", it is found that the angular offsets inside the bar roughly correspond to time delay of 10 myr , which value is in agreement with that determined for other spiral galaxies . * finally ,",
    "using the sfr derived from the background - subtracted h@xmath6 and 24-@xmath9 m images , the arm - to - interarm contrast of the sfe as a function of galactocentric radius is calculated .",
    "the sfe contrast is greater than unity ( 25 ) within the observed region , and suggests that the bar / arms most probably enhance the efficiency of star formation .",
    "it is also noteworthy that when the sfe is derived without background subtraction , the sfe contrast is nearly constant around unity .    in summary ,",
    "we note that despite recent studies emphasizing the importance of the non - steady nature of the spiral arms , the co - sf offsets and the sfe enhancement observed within and around the bar in m83 are in agreement with the predictions of the classical galactic shock model .",
    "the @xmath37-band image retrieved from the data archive of the 2mass large galaxy atlas @xcite is used to trace the stellar mass distribution in m83 .",
    "foreground stars , background galaxies , and certain discrete features that are most probably contaminated star forming regions , are removed from the image by fitting each source with a gaussian function .",
    "the `` cleaned image '' is deprojected using the position ( 225@xmath17 ) and inclination ( 24@xmath17 ) angles of the galaxy .    to save the computational costs required for the subsequent hydrodynamical calculation and to smooth out the small scale fluctuations ,",
    "the deprojected image is fourier - transformed in polar coordinates and any fourier components other than low - order even components ( @xmath88 = 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 and 8) are filtered out .",
    "figure [ fig : radial_fourier_comps](b ) shows the radial profile of the amplitude of the fourier components . as is clear from the figure , the non - axisymmetric perturbations are dominated by even components .",
    "thus , the omission of the odd components does not severely distort the morphology of the galaxy .",
    "the stretched and filtered @xmath37-band image is converted into the equivalent stellar surface mass density by applying a constant mass - to - light ratio determined using the maximum disk assumption , which will be referred in the next paragraph . to construct a three - dimensional mass distribution , a sech - squared law ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    "is assumed for the vertical distribution . to determine the scale height",
    ", the radial exponential scale length is determined from the radial profile of @xmath88 = 0 component ( figure [ fig : radial_fourier_comps]a ) and subsequently , a radial - to - vertical scale length ratio of 7 @xcite is assumed .",
    "radial exponential scale length is determined to be @xmath12.1 kpc and thus , scale height of the sech squared law is determined to be 600 pc , which asymptotically approaches the exponential length of 300 pc over a large distance .    by solving the poisson s equation ,",
    "the distribution of the gravitational potential is calculated .",
    "figure [ fig : rotcurve_compare ] shows the circular rotational velocity calculated from the @xmath88 = 0 part of the potential distribution .",
    "the observed rcs derived from the combined nma+45 m data with the envelop tracing method @xcite are also plotted for comparison .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio is determined by fitting the observed points of the flat section of the rc ( @xmath91 ) with the model ( @xmath92 @xmath93 ) .    using the gravitational potential ,",
    "a hydrodynamical simulation is performed to reproduce the observed gas kinematics .",
    "the pattern speed of the bar is fixed to @xmath56 = 57 km s@xmath4 kpc@xmath4 .",
    "a code based on the advection upstream splitting method ( ausm ) scheme is utilized for the calculation , provided by @xcite .",
    "the size of the pixel is about 40pc , and no recipe for star formation is included in the calculation .",
    "the calculation begins with the axisymmetric potential ( @xmath88 = 0 ) only , and bar / arm perturbations are gradually introduced to avoid introducing artificial numerical noise .",
    "after this simulation reach the stationary state , the calculation is terminated .",
