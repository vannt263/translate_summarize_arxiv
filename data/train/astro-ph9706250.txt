    "the idea that the breakdown of some fundamental symmetry and the consequent field ordering might be responsible for structure formation in the universe is an attractive one .",
    "recently we have performed the first complete calculations of the power spectra of perturbations in symmetry breaking theories , including global cosmic strings , monopoles and texture @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these calculations revealed that vector and tensor modes give a larger contribution to the large scale anisotropies than previously suspected , and that their fractional contributions to the total microwave anisotropy power spectrum are comparable for each theory considered ( see figure 1 ) . simultaneous work on local strings @xcite has produced compatible conclusions .",
    "the main implication of the large vector and tensor contribution on large angular scales is in reducing the normalisation of the scalar perturbations , which are responsible for the doppler peaks .",
    "once the vector and tensor contributions are properly included , the height of the doppler peaks are low relative to the large angular scale sachs - wolfe plateau@xcite .",
    "the present paper represents an analytical attempt to explain why vector and tensor contributions are substantial on large angular scales , using only the most fundamental properties of the simplest defect theories , namely scaling , causality and statistical isotropy .",
    "we illustrate the arguments through comparison with the results of numerical computations @xcite .",
    "[ fig : comp1 ]",
    "as discussed in @xcite , all perturbation power spectra are determined by the unequal time correlator ( uetc ) of the defect source stress energy tensor @xmath2 :    _ ( * k * , ) _ ( -*k*, ) _ , ( k,, ) [ eq : uetc ] where @xmath3 , @xmath4 denote conformal time , and @xmath5 comoving wavenumber .",
    "note that ( [ eq : uetc ] ) is real because complex conjugation is equivalent to the replacement @xmath6 .",
    "the correlators are invariant under this replacement because the statistical ensemble is rotation invariant .",
    "causality means that the real space correlators of the fluctuating part of @xmath7 must be zero for @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "scaling dictates that in the pure matter or radiation eras @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the symmetry breaking scale and @xmath11 is a dimensionless scaling function . finally , @xmath7 must obey the equations for stress energy conservation with respect to the background metric ( see next section ) .",
    "these provide two linear constraints on the four scalar components of the source .",
    "any pair determines the other two up to possible integration constants . in the matter era",
    "the pair @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite provides a convenient choice , allowing an analytical integral solution to the linearised einstein equations .",
    "but for work including the matter - radiation transition @xcite the pair @xmath14 and @xmath13 is better , because it results in the correct redshifting away of all components of the source stress energy inside the horizon . in this paper we shall use both pairs - @xmath12 and @xmath13 in our analytical discussion of an ` incoherent ' model , and @xmath14 and @xmath13 for a numericaly solved ` coherent ' model . in the former case , we shall constrain @xmath12 and @xmath13 so that on subhorizon scales the source is negligible ( see section iv ) .    the unequal time",
    "correlator in @xmath5 space is the fourier transform of the real space correlator : @xmath15 .",
    "the integral is finite because the real space correlator has compact support , and it follows that the unequal time correlators are analytic in @xmath16 for all finite @xmath5 .",
    "they may thus be expanded as taylor series in the cartesian components @xmath17 about @xmath18 .",
    "as @xmath17 tends to zero , isotropy and symmetry impose * k*0 _ ij(*k * , ) _",

    "( see e.g. @xcite ) one finds that the only nonzero correlators consistent with statistical isotropy and homogeneity are @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . from ( [ eq : smallk ] ) one can compute the small @xmath5 power spectra of the anisotropic scalar , vector and tensor stresses .",
    "one finds they are in the ratios    summed .",
    "thus in a causal theory anisotropic scalar , vector and tensor stresses have white noise components at small @xmath5 with related amplitudes .",
    "a similar argument shows that the correlator @xmath32 at small @xmath5 , implying that @xmath33 vanishes like @xmath34 at small @xmath5 . likewise @xmath35 vanishes like @xmath34 at small @xmath5 .",
    "so for either of the two choices discussed above , the two scalar source components are uncorrelated outside the horizon .",
    "[ fig : comp4 ]",
    "in the cosmic defect theories , perturbations are predominantly produced on the horizon scale .",
    "studies show that the unequal time correlators take the predicted white noise form for @xmath36 or so , and decline strongly at larger @xmath37 . to the extent",
    "that the horizon scale modes reflect the causality constraints discussed above , the latter translate into definite relations between the scalar , vector and tensor perturbation power spectra . in figures 2 and 3",
    "we show the cmb anisotropy power spectra calculated in the cosmic global string and texture theories respectively , with and without a cutoff where we switch off the source stress tensor for @xmath38 .",
    "the figures show that in the texture theory the effect of suppressing the source for @xmath38 is relatively minor . for strings ,",
    "there is a larger effect , but even here the _ ratios _ of scalar to vector to tensor anisotropies are not much affected .",
    "we conclude that the contributions from @xmath36 , which we shall term superhorizon modes , are certainly important in both theories and give at the least a rough measure of the importance of the scalar , vector and tensor contributions to the large angle anisotropies .",
    "[ fig : comp5 ]",
    "the fact that a cutoff on subhorizon scales does not greatly affect the large angle @xmath39 spectrum has important implications .",
    "it means that the short distance structure of the individual defects is not important in determining the qualitative character of the large angle anisotropies , such as the relative scalar / vector / tensor contributions .",
    "consider the effect of modelling the sources using a ` smoothed ' @xmath14 tensor , one where we impose a cutoff at @xmath40 .",
    "we feed in the smoothed @xmath14 and @xmath13 into the stress energy conervation equations : _ 00 + ( _ 00 + ) = ; + 2 = - ( + 2^s ) .",
    "[ eq : momc ] where @xmath41 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are defined in the previous section .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the solutions for @xmath42 and @xmath12 are well defined .    in this scheme ,",
    "we deduce important relations between @xmath12 and @xmath13 . equations ( [ eq : momc ] ) are easily integrated to obtain @xmath14 in terms of @xmath12 and @xmath13 : exchanging the order of the double integral we get _ 00 = ^-2 , [ eq : sole ] where we used @xmath43 in the matter era .",
    "but as argued , the smoothed @xmath14 is identically zero inside the horizon .",
    "it follows that both the @xmath44 and @xmath45 coefficients integrate to zero .",
    "the former gives _ 0^d  = 0 , [ eq : conb ] and the latter gives _",
    "0^d  ^4 ( + 2^s)(k, ) = 0 .",
    "[ eq : cona ] this imposes a negative correlation between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and guarantees that @xmath42 vanishes faster than @xmath46 inside the horizon .",
    "the constraints ( [ eq : conb ] ) and ( [ eq : cona ] ) will turn out to be remarkably powerful when building models for the superhorizon components of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we wish to compute the large angular scale anisotropies produced in the matter era . for this purpose",

    "so the violations of causality are small .",
    "rotational invariance forbids any cross - correlation between scalar , vector or tensor modes .",
    "there is however one more allowed cross correlator , namely that between the isotropic and anisotropic stresses .",
    "the argument given in section iii implies that @xmath58 vanishes as @xmath34 for small @xmath5 , but it can not be zero because of the constraint ( [ eq : cona ] ) .",
    "we choose to model it as ( 16 g)^2 ( * k * , ) ^s(-*k*, ) = ( -k ) ( - ) ( k ) ^2 a^s [ eq : ccorr ] if we now compute the equal time correlator of the the constraint ( [ eq : cona ] ) , we determine ^s = -1136 ( a+4a^s ) .",

    "the procedure is simple in principle : the correlators ( [ eq : strcorr ] ) translate into correlators of the metric perturbations and thus into correlators of the temperature perturbations , equivalent to the anisotropy power spectrum @xmath39 .",
    "but in order to compute the relevant integrals analytically , we shall make two approximations .",
    "the first is that we shall replace metric perturbation unequal time correlators under @xmath3 integrals using the following formula : ( ) (  ) & & ( - ) d d a ( ) b ( ) [ eq : approx ] the weighting function is chosen so that the integrals @xmath65 of both sides are guaranteed to be equal for all @xmath66 .",
    "the formula is also invariant under changing variables from @xmath3 to any other function @xmath67 .",
    "the second approximation is to use the fact that the greens functions in ( [ eq : exact ] ) fall off strongly with @xmath3 .",
    "this means that the metric perturbations fall off rapidly beyond @xmath68 , which justifies us simply setting them zero beyond that point .",

    "the calculation demonstrates the relative importance of the vector and tensor modes , consistent with the numerical results shown in figure 1 .",
    "given the crude nature of the model used , the agreement is actually surprisingly good .",
    "the weakest point in the model is that it involves a free parameter @xmath94 , and the @xmath39 s obtained are proportional to @xmath95 .",
    "it seems plausible that @xmath94 should be the same for the scalar , vector and tensor stresses , but we have not found any argument as to why this should necessarily be true .",
    "let us summarise the approximations and assumptions implicit in ( [ eq : res ] ) :    @xmath96 we assumed that superhorizon modes with @xmath36 dominate .",
    "@xmath96 we modelled the unequal time correlators as delta functions with a horizon scale cutoff .",
    "@xmath96 we made the approximation of pure matter domination for the background spacetime . in this approximation the @xmath39 spectra obtained are scale invariant at large @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath96 we replaced certain functions with amplitudes times delta functions in order to perform the relevant integrals .    with all of these caveats",
    ", we feel that the model provides useful insight into the relative importance of scalar , vector and tensor contributions to the large angle anisotropies .",
    "the model explains why vector perturbations dominate over tensors , and why the combined vector and tensor contribution is comparable to that from scalars .",
    "as a further model we have considered the case of a completely coherent source in which the unequal time correlators of @xmath14 , @xmath13 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 are all proportional to the product of heaviside functions , for example setting _ 00 ( * k * , ) _ 00(-*k*, ) = ( )^-12 ( - k ) ( - k ) .",
    "[ eq : nummodel ] note that we need to model the white noise @xmath13 contribution , but as mentioned above , the cross correlator must vanish at small @xmath5 .",
    "so in this model we will assume that @xmath99 is identically zero , and therefore solve for the @xmath14 and @xmath13 contributions separately .",
    "note that with this choice of variables , the constraints ( [ eq : conb ] ) and ( [ eq : cona ] ) are automatically satisfied .",
    "[ fig : model ]    we have used this model in the full boltzmann code developed in @xcite as usual with @xmath100 .",
    "the results are shown in figure 5 .",
    "the anisotropic scalar , vector and tensor @xmath39 s have been scaled so that the stress tensor white noise superhorizon amplitudes are in the correct ratios ( [ eq : ratios ] ) .",
    "@xmath101 has been scaled with @xmath102 .",
    "it is a remarkably small contribution .",
    "this may be understood by solving the equations for stress energy conservation for @xmath12 , whence one finds that @xmath103 is actually very small in the coherent model at horizon crossing @xmath40 , so that from ( [ eq : exact ] ) its contribution to the anisotropy is small .",
    "the coherent model provides a useful comparison to the previous incoherent model .",
    "the broad agreement between the two models suggests that our main result ( [ eq : res ] ) is actually insensitive to the detailed nature of the source .",
    "an advantage of the coherent model is that we can more easily incorporate the matter - radiation transition , giving rise to departures from scale invariance in the @xmath39 spectrum qualitatively similar in character to those observed in the realistic source calculations . and",
    "as seen in figure 5 the model gives a reasonable impression of the main features of the realistic calculations in figure 1 , at least on large angular scales .",
    "in this paper we have developed a set of physically reasonable models for the perturbations generated on superhorizon scales by causal sources .",
    "we gave some rigorous and some approximate arguments that the large angular scale anisotropies due to the scalar and vector plus tensor modes are in general similar in magnitude .",
    "if the vector and tensor contributions to the large angle anisotropies are large , the scalar normalisation is lower and the doppler peaks due to scalar perturbations are small compared to the large angle sachs - wolfe plateau .",
    "let us close by mentioning some loopholes in the above arguments , which make it possible to circumvent the conclusion that causal sources are unlikely to have large doppler peaks .",
    "@xmath96 if subhorizon modes with @xmath38 dominate the anisotropies then our arguments do not apply . sources in this category",
    "have been explored by durrer and sakellariadou @xcite .",
    "@xmath96 if the shape of the unequal time correlators , parametrised in our models by @xmath94 is different for the scalar , vector and tensor components , then the @xmath39 contributions could be strongly affected , since @xmath104 .",
    "one could imagine a model where @xmath94 for scalars was larger than for vectors and tensors , but even here one would probably not find sharp doppler peaks , since increasing @xmath94 is likely to increase the incoherence of the source and thus smoothe out the doppler peaks ( this is apparent in figures 2 and 3 ) .",
    "@xmath96 one could consider sources like those in @xcite in which the anisotropic stresses are by construction zero outside the horizon .",
    "in such a model the superhorizon constraint ( [ eq : ratios ] ) is satisfied with all terms being zero . in the model of @xcite",
    "this is true because the real space stress energy master functions were taken to be _ spherically symmetric _ , clearly a special case .",
    "@xmath96 we have assumed perfect scaling of the sources , and matter domination .",
    "there is some violation of scaling due to the matter - radiation transition , but this is a small effect on large angular scales .",
