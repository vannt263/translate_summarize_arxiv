    "in such a setting , because of the expanding property , one can expect to obtain conditionally invariant probability measures that are _ absolutely continuous _ with respect to lebesgue measure @xcite .",

    "these conditions also guarantee the existence of a _",
    "unique _ absolutely continuous conditionally invariant probability measure ( accim ) .",

    "robustness of these objects with respect to ulam discretizations is essentially due to a _",

    "our main result , theorem  [ mainthm ] , concerns convergence properties of an extension of the well - known construction of ulam @xcite , which allows for efficient numerical estimation of invariant densities of closed dynamical systems .",
    "the ulam approach partitions the domain @xmath1 into a collection of connected sets @xmath26 and computes single - step transitions between partition sets , producing the matrix @xmath27 li @xcite demonstrated that the invariant density of lasota - yorke maps can be @xmath28-approximated by step functions obtained directly from the leading left eigenvector of @xmath29 . since the publication of @xcite there have been many extensions of ulam s method to more general classes of maps , including expanding maps in higher dimensions @xcite , uniformly hyperbolic maps @xcite , nonuniformly expanding interval maps @xcite , and random maps @xcite .",

    "<S> ulam s method is a rigorous numerical scheme for approximating invariant densities of dynamical systems . </S>",
    "<S> the phase space is partitioned into connected sets and an inter - set transition matrix is computed from the dynamics ; an approximate invariant density is read off as the leading left eigenvector of this matrix . </S>",
    "<S> when a hole in phase space is introduced , one instead searches for _ conditional _ invariant densities and their associated escape rates . for lasota - yorke maps with holes </S>",
    "<S> we prove that a simple adaptation of the standard ulam scheme provides convergent sequences of escape rates ( from the leading eigenvalue ) , conditional invariant densities ( from the corresponding left eigenvector ) , and quasi - conformal measures ( from the corresponding right eigenvector ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also immediately obtain a convergent sequence for the invariant measure supported on the survivor set . </S>",
    "<S> our approach allows us to consider relatively large holes . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the approach with several families of examples , including a class of lorenz maps . </S>"
