    "indeed , this is the famous instability , discovered in the seminal papers by papaloizou and pringle @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is easy to understand shapes of equipotential surfaces in a fat torus ( shown in figure [ slender - fat ] ) . very far from the axis of rotation one has @xmath131 .",
    "inserting this into ( [ equipotential-2 ] ) one gets @xmath132 which means that far from the rotation axis the equipotential surfaces are spheres with radius @xmath133 , and that the outer radius of the torus is at @xmath134 .",
    "spherical equipotentials are in accord with the fact that very far from the axis , @xmath135 , the centrifugal force @xmath136 is negligible with respect to the gravitational force @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , the effective gravity is determined by newton s attraction alone , as for spherical stars . for the same reason ,",
    "the radiation power from this part of the surface of a fat , radiation pressure supported torus ( i.e. polish doughnut ) is _ one eddington luminosity _ , the same as from a spherical non - rotating , radiation pressure supported star .",
    "note , however , that the asymptotically spherical shape of a fat torus is a direct consequence of the assumption @xmath138 , which was made ad hoc . if one adopts a more physically realistic assumption that asymptotically @xmath139 , one may use the standard shakura - sunyaev model in its radiation pressure version , to get the asymptotic shape of the fat torus ,    @xmath140    closer to the axis , @xmath141 , which means that @xmath142 and this together with ( [ equipotential-2 ] ) gives @xmath143 , i.e. that closer to the axis , equipotential surfaces corresponding to @xmath144 have conical shapes with the half opening @xmath145 .",
    "the surfaces are highly non spherical because centrifugal force dominates .",
    "integrating effective gravity along the conical funnel is elementary , and one gets @xcite that @xmath146 .",
    "this estimate may be used to find the total luminosity for the radiation pressure supported fat torus .",
    "i.e. a polish doughnut ,    @xmath147    it should be clear from our derivation , that the logarithmic scaling of the luminosity with the torus size is a genuine property of the polish doughnuts , including those that have a non - constant angular momentum distribution .",
    "the logarithm in ( [ logarithm ] ) is of a crucial importance , as it prevents astrophysically realistic doughnuts ( i.e. with @xmath148 , say ) to have highly super - eddington luminosities .",
    "thus , the theory predicts that for such `` realistic '' fat tori , only a slightly super - eddington total ( isotropic ) luminosities , @xmath149 , may be expected .",
    "however , because the funnels have solid angles @xmath150 , radiation in the funnels may be , in principle , collimated to highly super - eddington values @xmath151 .",
    "this simple estimate agrees with a more detailed modelling of the polish doughnuts radiation field by sikora @xcite and madau @xcite who obtained @xmath152 for disks with @xmath153 . a typical value that follows from observational estimates for non - blazar active galactic nuclei , e.g. by czerny and elvis @xcite and malkan @xcite , is @xmath154 , but of course for blazars and other similar sources ( e.g. for ulxs , if they are powered by stellar mass black holes , as argued by king @xcite ) , it must be @xmath155 .",
    "such high values of @xmath156 are also consistent with the idea , suggested by paczyski @xcite and independently by lynden - bell @xcite , that relativistic electron - positron @xmath157 jets may be very effectively accelerated by the radiation pressure in the fat tori funnels .",
    "note , that if the flux in the funnel is @xmath156 times the eddington flux , the @xmath157 plasma feels the `` effective '' radiative force corresponding to the eddington ratio @xmath158 times greater jets the situation is very much different ( opposite ) : the luminosity is _ physically _ very super - eddington , although it may be just slightly above the standard limit . ] .",
    "detailed calculations ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) demonstrated that indeed the @xmath157 jets may be accelerated in funnels up to the lorentz factor @xmath159 .",
    "however , if jets are initially pre - accelerated by some black - hole electrodynamical processes ( such as the blandford - znajek mechanism @xcite ) to highly relativistic velocities @xmath160 , they will be decelerated in the funnels by the compton drag , reaching the asymptotic lorentz factor @xcite ,    @xmath161    observations tell that @xmath162 , and thus equation ( [ lanza ] ) suggests that @xmath163 .      in the time of their dbut",
    ", polish doughnuts could theoretically confirm the observed super - eddington luminosities , highly collimated beams of radiation , and perhaps even the relativistic speeds of jets , fulfilling another principle attributed to eddington @xcite : _ one should never believe any experiment until it has been confirmed by theory .",
    "_ these virtues attracted initially some interest of the astrophysical community , but the interest has quickly drained with the discovery of the papaloizou - pringle instability . it was thought that polish doughnuts must necessarily suffer from the instability and thus , in reality , they can not exist . the important discovery by blaes @xcite that the roche lobe overflow stabilizes polish doughnuts against the papaloizou - pringle instability , came too late  in the advent of numerical simulations of black hole accretion flows .",
    "too late , because numerical simulations rediscovered and absorbed many of the polish doughnuts results . today ,",
    "these results exist in the consciousness of many astrophysicists as a set of several numerically established , important but unrelated facts .",
    "they do not form a consistent scheme that the polish doughnuts once offered : clear , simple , following directly from the black hole physics .",
    "in the rest of my review , i recall the most fundamental of these results , almost totally forgotten today : the relativistic roche lobe overflow mechanism .",
    "the mechanism not only stabilizes polish doughnuts against the papaloizou - pringle and other instabilities .",
    "it also assures that highly super - eddington accretion rates always imply a very low efficiency of accretion yrs ( for agn ) has some observational back - up @xcite , it was never studied sufficiently deeply . ] .",
    "i like to illustrate the physical meaning of accretion disk efficiency in terms of the bekenstein engine .",
    "bekenstein @xcite discussed a black hole engine that converts mass to energy with a perfect efficiency , following an earlier unpublished remark by geroch @xcite .",
    "the engine works by slowly lowering on a strong wire a mass @xmath164 into a black hole with the schwarzschild radius @xmath165 and mass @xmath14 .",
    "as the mass is lowered to a radius @xmath19 , the energy @xmath166 measured at infinity is gravitationally redshifted and thus goes down relative to the initial energy @xmath167 .",
    "the change in energy equals to the mechanical work done by the wire back at the engine .",
    "the efficiency @xmath168/e_0}$ ] may be calculated from the gravitational redshift formula , @xmath169 .",
    "if the mass could be lowered to the horizon @xmath170 , the efficiency would go to @xmath171 .",
    "of course , the mass can not touch the horizon , because the tension in the wire would be then infinite , and even the strongest wire would break .",
    "real wires , that may sustain only a finite tension ( see e.g. gibbons @xcite ) , would break a finite distance @xmath172 from the horizon . in a region below the breaking radius , @xmath173 ,",
    "the mass falls down freely , keeping its energy measured at infinity unchanged .",
    "therefore , the efficiency is determined by the radius @xmath174 at which the wire breaks , @xmath175/e_0}$ ] .         with centrifugal support playing a role of the rope , accretion s efficiency",
    "is also determined by the radius @xmath174 at which the centrifugal support breaks .",
    "consider a collection of free particles on keplerian circular orbits around a black hole .",
    "small viscosity will slowly remove angular momentum , so particles will slowly drift inward .",
    "however , in the region @xmath176 , there are no stable circular orbits , and therefore the centrifugal support breaks : the particles free - fall into the black hole .",
    "thus , similarly as in the case of the bekenstein engine , the keplerian binding energy of particles at the location of the marginally stable orbit , @xmath177 ( also called isco ) , determines the efficiency of accretion .",
    "the location of @xmath177 is determined by the minimum of the keplerian angular momentum @xmath178 , shown in figure [ roche ] , left . for a constant angular momentum fluid torus , @xmath179 , the combined pressure and centrifugal support breaks at the radius @xmath180 , defined by @xmath181 and shown in the same figure , by the dot left of @xmath177 on the angular momentum distribution .    at this location , as discovered by abramowicz , jaroszyski and sikora @xcite , one of the equipotential surfaces , called the roche lobe , self - crosses as shown in figure [ roche ] ( right ) .",
    "it should be obvious that if the fluid distribution overflows the roche lobe , a dynamical mass loss must occur : at the the circle @xmath182 the centrifugal and pressure support breaks down , and fluid if free falling in the region @xmath183 .",
    "again , the efficiency is determined by the keplerian binding energy at breaking point , @xmath184 , called the _ inner edge _ of the accretion disk .",
    "this name is the source of a confusion , as some wrongly imagine that the name implies that at the inner `` edge '' velocity , density , and pressure must experience a jump , or a sudden change .",
    "of course they do not .",
    "what _ does _ change in the region close to @xmath184 is the nature of the flow : from sub - sonic to super - sonic .",
    "note also that for low angular momentum flows , with @xmath185 everywhere , there is no roche lobe , and therefore the inner edge can not be sensibly defined .",
    "such flows differ considerably from the polish doughnuts , see e.g. @xcite .",

    "this has two important consequences : the efficiency of a torus with @xmath191 is zero , _ and _ such a torus must have its outer radius at a very large distance , formally at infinity , @xmath192 .",
    "we have previously shown that the total luminosity of a fat torus increases logarithmically with the outer radius .",
    "this , combined with the accretion rate being proportional to the size ( [ asymptotic - thickness ] ) , yields the logarithmic behavior @xmath193 . indeed",
    ", paczyski @xcite found that all fat disks calculated by him obey    @xmath194    this shows that the super - critical accretion is qualitatively different from the standard , sub - eddington , thin disk accretion .",
    "for the standard thin disks , the total luminosity is directly proportional to the accretion rate @xmath195 .",
    "the roche lobe overflow mechanism self - regulates the accretion rate , which for a polytropic equation of state , @xmath196 equals ,    @xmath197    with an analytic expression for @xmath198 explicitly known in terms of the euler gamma function , @xmath199 . because @xmath200 for a radiation pressure supported gas , the self - regulation imposed by ( [ euler - gamma ] ) is a very strong one , @xmath201 .",
    "suppose , that in the region close to the inner edge , there is a fluctuation in the thermal balance , causing overheating .",
    "this will induce an expansion , and an increase in the roche - lobe overflow , which in turn will increase the accretion rate , i.e. the mass loss from the region .",
    "the heat contained in the mass that is lost will cool down the region , thus assuring thermal stability .",
    "i found @xcite that this mechanism of advective cooling caused by the roche lobe overflow , always stabilizes the innermost region of _ any _ accretion disk ( thin , slim , thick , adaf ) against thermal and viscous instability . roughly speaking ,",
    "the _ local _ instabilities have no chance to grow in the innermost region of accretion disks , because they are quickly washed away by advection caused by the roche lobe overflow .",
    "stabilization of the _ global _ papaloizou - pringle instability by the roche lobe overflow , found by blaes @xcite , has a different physical reason : almost a perfect reflection of the papaloizou - pringle mode at the inner disk edge is a necessary ingredient of the instability .",
    "the reflection is not possible in the fast ( transonic ) flow induced by the roche lobe overflow .",
    "thus , the non - realistic , non - accreting polish doughnuts indeed always suffer from the paploizou - pingle instability . in a more realistic model of a polish doughnut , that includes the roche lobe overflow",
    ", the paploizou - pringle instability does not operate .",
    "an accurate and elegant model for a non - rotating black hole s gravity was introduced by paczyski @xcite it terms of a newtonian gravitational `` pseudo - potential '' ,    @xmath202    the paczyski model is remarkably successful : numerous authors used it in their calculations of black hole accretion flows .",
    "this clever idea can not be , however , applied for : ( a ) rotating black holes , because of the lense - thirring effect , and ( b ) self - gravitating fluids , as @xmath203 .",
    "properties of accretion flows with @xmath205 are sometime discussed in terms of the standard thin shakura - sunyaev model .",
    "however , the standard thin disk is inconsistent with the super - eddington accretion .",
    "indeed , the radiative force can not be greater than the effective gravity force , and at the surface of the standard disk this condition yields ,    @xmath206^{1 \\over 2}\\ , .\\ ] ]    from ( [ pacz1 ] ) paczyski @xcite derived @xmath207 .",
    "this means that for a super - eddington accretion with @xmath208 it also must be @xmath209 .",
    "however , the standard model is a 1d approximation to the 3d accretion physics and assumes @xmath210 .",
    "its structure equations contain only zero and first order terms in @xmath211 .",
    "therefore , the super - eddington accretion is outside of the standard model applicability range .",
    "contrary to this , slim disks and polish doughnuts are suitable to describe super - eddington accretion : slim disks are accurate up to the second order terms in @xmath211 , and polish doughnuts are described by the full 3d equations ( i.e. contain @xmath211 terms of _ all _ orders ) .      the blandford & begelman `` adios '' paper @xcite claims that accretion with small efficiency ( polish doughnuts , adafs ) must _ necessarily _ experience strong outflows , _ because _ matter in these flows has everywhere a positive bernoulli constant .    while the very existence of strong outflows from small efficiency accretion black hole flows seems to be supported by observations , and",
    "therefore is most probably true , the reasons given by blandford & begelman to explain the outflows , are certainly not correct , because , as discussed in @xcite by abramowicz , lasota & igumenshchev , ( 1)@xmath5a positive bernoulli constant is only a necessary , but certainly not a sufficient , condition for outflows .",
    "( 2)@xmath5the very argument that low efficiency accretion has a positive bernoulli constant everywhere is not correct itself .",
    "it follows from an _ ad hoc _ mathematical assumption ( made in order to make the problem easier to solve ) that inefficient accretion flows are self - similar .",
    "real flows obey inner and outer boundary conditions and for this reason are not self - similar .",
    "the boundary conditions imply _ negative _ bernoulli constant at least close to both boundaries .",
    "observations provide a clear evidence for super - eddington luminosities powered by accretion onto black holes .",
    "theory , solidly based on standard physics , predicts that such super - eddington luminosities imply highly super - eddington accretion rates and a very low efficiency of the black hole accretion .",
    "the powerful and simple sotan argument shows , however , that the efficiency can not be low all the time , because in the case of agn this would be in a direct conflict with observations .",
    "thus , observations and theory together seem to point that highly super - eddington accretion , that really occur in several black hole sources , is a _ transient _ `` flip - flop '' phenomenon . a physical mechanism ( or mechanisms ? ) for the flip - flop behavior , in which periods of highly supper - eddington but low efficiency accretion alternate with periods of highly efficient , sub - eddington or nearly - eddington accretion is not yet known .",
    "its understanding presents a great challenge for all of us .    neither `` adios '' , nor any other theoretical model , could at present explain strong outflows and jets that are observed in several super - eddington black hole sources .",
    "understanding of such outflows is another great challenge .      _",
