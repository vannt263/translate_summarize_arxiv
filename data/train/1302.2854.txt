    "the parity - violating deep inelastic scattering ( pvdis ) experiment e08 - 011 was completed in december 2009 at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) .",
    "the goal of this experiment  @xcite was to measure with high precision the parity - violating asymmetry in deep inelastic scattering of a polarized 6  gev electron beam on an unpolarized liquid deuterium target .",
    "this asymmetry is sensitive to the quark weak axial charge @xmath2 which corresponds to a helicity dependence in the quark coupling with the @xmath3 boson .    for electron inclusive scattering from an unpolarized target ,",
    "the electromagnetic interaction is parity conserving and is insensitive to the spin flip of the incoming electron beam .",
    "only the weak interaction violates parity and causes a difference between the right- and the left - handed electron scattering cross - sections @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the dominant contribution to the parity violation asymmetry , @xmath6 , arises from the interference between electromagnetic and weak interactions and is proportional to the four momentum transfer squared @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "the magnitude of the asymmetry is on the order of @xmath0 or @xmath9  parts per million ( ppm ) at @xmath10  ( gev/@xmath11)@xmath12 .",
    "the goal of jlab e08 - 011 was to measure the pvdis asymmetries to statistical precisions of 3% and 4% at @xmath33 and @xmath34  ( gev/@xmath11)@xmath12 , respectively , and under the assumption that hadronic physics corrections are small , to extract the quark axial weak charge combination @xmath35 .",
    "in addition , the systematic uncertainty goal was less than @xmath36 . for this experiment , the expected asymmetries were 91 and 160  ppm respectively at the two @xmath7 values  @xcite . to achieve the required precision , an event rate capability of up to 600  khz was needed .",
    "the main challenge of deep inelastic scattering experiments is the separation of scattered electrons from the pion background in the spectrometer and detector system .",
    "the neutral pions would decay into @xmath37 pairs from which the electrons produced can not be rejected by detectors .",
    "this pair production background was studied by reversing the spectrometer magnet settings and measure the @xmath38 yield , and the effect on the measured asymmetries was found to be negligible .",
    "charged pions are produced primarily from nucleon resonance decays and could carry a parity violation asymmetry corresponding to the @xmath7 at which the resonances are produced , typically a fraction of the asymmetry of electrons with the same scattered momentum .",
    "assuming that a fraction @xmath39 of the detected events are @xmath40 and @xmath41 are electrons , the measured asymmetry is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the desired electron scattering asymmetry and @xmath44 is the asymmetry of the pion background . to extract @xmath43 to a high precision , one needs either to minimize the pion contamination @xmath39 to a negligible level , or to correct the measured asymmetry for the asymmetry of pions , which itself needs to be measured precisely . for the pvdis experiment ,",
    "the goal was to control @xmath39 to the @xmath0 level provided that the pion asymmetries did not exceed those of electrons .",
    "the experiment used a 100  @xmath45a electron beam with a polarization of approximately 90% and a 20-cm long liquid deuterium target .",
    "the two high resolution spectrometers ( hrs )  @xcite were used to detect scattered events .",
    "while the standard hrs detector package and data acquisition ( daq ) system routinely provide a @xmath46 pion rejection with approximately @xmath47 electron efficiency , they are based on full recording of the detector signals and are limited to event rates up to 4  khz  @xcite .",
    "this is not sufficient for the high rates expected for the experiment .",
    "( the hrs daq will be referred to as `` standard daq '' hereafter . )",
    "recent parity violation electron scattering experiments , such as happex  @xcite , and prex  @xcite at jlab , focused on elastic scattering from nuclear or nucleon targets that are typically not contaminated by inelastic backgrounds .",
    "signals from the detectors can be integrated and a helicity dependence in the integrated signal can be used to extract the physics asymmetry .",
    "an integrating daq was also used in the preceding pvdis measurement at slac  @xcite in which approximately 2% of the integrated signal was attributed to pions .",
    "the sample experiment  @xcite at mit - bates focused also on elastic scattering but the inelastic contamination was more challenging to reject , and an air cherenkov counter was used to select only elastic scattering events . in the mainz pva4 experiment  @xcite , particles were detected in a total absorption calorimeter and the integrated energy spectrum was recorded . charged pions and other background were separated from electrons in the offline analysis of the energy spectrum , and the pion rejection was on the order of 100:1 based on the characteristics of the calorimeter .",
    "high performance particle identification can usually be realized in a counting - based daq where each event is evaluated individually . in the g0 experiment  @xcite at jlab ,",
    "a superconducting spectrometer with a @xmath48 azimuthal angle coverage was used to detect elastically scattered protons at the forward angle and elastic electrons at the backward angle . at the forward angle",
    ", protons were identified using time - of - flight . at the backward angle",
    ", pions were rejected from electrons using an aerogel cherenkov counter , and a pion rejection factor of @xmath49 or better was reported  @xcite .",
    "the deadtime correction of the counting system was on the order of a few percent  @xcite .",
    "while the pvdis experiment could fully utilize existing spectrometers and detectors at jlab , examination of all existing techniques for pv measurements made it clear that a custom electronics and daq were needed to keep the systematic uncertainties due to data collection to below 1% . in this paper",
    "we describe a scaler - based , cost effective counting daq which limited the pion contamination of the data sample to a negligible level of @xmath50 .",
    "basic information on the detector package and the daq setup will be presented first and followed by the analysis of electron detection efficiency , pion rejection and contamination , corrections due to counting deadtime , and the statistical quality of the asymmetry measurement .",
    "the design goal of the daq is to record data up to 600  khz with hardware - based pid and well measured and understood deadtime effects .",
    "the following detectors in the hrs  @xcite were used to characterize scattered particles : two scintillator planes provided the main trigger , while a co@xmath51 gas cherenkov detector and a double - layer segmented lead - glass detector provided particle identification information .",
    "the vertical drift chambers ( as the tracking detector ) were used during calibration runs but were turned off during production data taking because they were not expected to endure the high event rates .    for the gas cherenkov and the lead - glass detector ,",
    "a full recording of their output adc data was not feasible at the expected high rate .",
    "instead their signals were passed through discriminators and logic units to form preliminary electron and pion triggers .",
    "these preliminary triggers were then combined with the scintillator triggers to form the final electron and pion triggers , which were sent to scalers to record the event counts and used offline to form asymmetries @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the integrated rate of the triggers normalized to the integrated beam charge for the right@xmath54 and left@xmath55 handed spin ( helicity ) states of the incident electron beam .",
    "the scalers that counted triggers and the beam charge were integrated over the helicity period , which was flipped pseudo - randomly at 30 hz per the experimental technique used by the happex experiments  @xcite .    for the hrs",
    "the two layers of the lead - glass detector are called `` preshower '' and `` shower '' detectors , respectively .",
    "the preshower in the right hrs ( the spectrometer located to the right side of the beamline when viewed along the beam direction ) has @xmath56 blocks arranged in a @xmath57 array , with the longest dimension of the blocks aligned perpendicular to the particle trajectory .",
    "for the two blocks in each row , only the ends facing outward are read out by photo - multiplier tubes ( pmts ) , while the other ends of the two blocks are facing each other and not read out .",
    "therefore , the preshower detector has @xmath56 output channels .",
    "all preshower blocks were individually wrapped to prevent light leak .",
    "the shower detector in the right hrs had @xmath58 blocks arranged in a @xmath59 array with the longest dimension of the blocks aligned along the trajectory of scattered particles .",
    "pmts were attached to each block of the right shower detector on one end only , giving normally @xmath58 output channels . however to minimize the electronics needed for this experiment ( see next paragraph ) , only 60 of the 75 shower blocks were used while signals from the 15 blocks on the edge were not utilized by the daq .",
    "the reduction of the hrs acceptance due to not using these side blocks was negligible .",
    "the preshower and the shower detectors in the left hrs are similar to the preshower detector on the right hrs except that for each detector there are @xmath60 blocks arranged in a @xmath61 array .    because the lead - glass detectors in the left and right hrs are different , design of the lead - glass - based triggers of the daq is also different , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : grouping ] . as a compromise between the amount of electronics needed and the rate in the front end logic modules ,",
    "the lead - glass blocks in both the preshower and the shower detectors were divided into 6 ( 8) groups for the left ( right ) hrs , with each group consisting typically 8 blocks .",
    "signals from the 8 blocks in each group were added using a custom - made analog summing unit called the `` sum8 module '' , then passed to discriminators .",
    "the geometry and the position of each preshower group were carefully chosen to match those of the corresponding shower group to maximize electron detection efficiency . on the left hrs , adjacent groups in both preshower and shower had overlapping blocks , while for the right hrs only preshower groups were overlapping . to allow overlap between adjacent groups , signals from preshower blocks on the right hrs and from both preshower and shower blocks on the left hrs were split into two identical copies using passive splitters .             a schematic diagram of the daq electronics for the right hrs is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : daqflowchart ] .",
    "preliminary electron and pion triggers were formed by passing shower ( ss ) and preshower ( ps ) signals and their sums , called total shower ( ts ) signals , through discriminators with different thresholds . for electron triggers ,",
    "logical ands of the ps discriminator and the ts discriminator outputs were used . for pions , low threshold discriminators on the ts signal alone",
    "were sent to logical or modules to produce preliminary triggers .",
    "additional background rejection was provided by the `` gate '' circuit , which combined signals from the gas cherenkov ( gc ) and the `` t1 '' signal  @xcite from the scintillators ( sc ) . each valid coincidence between gc and t1",
    "would produce a 150-ns wide electron gate signal that allowed an output to be formed by the logical and modules from the preliminary electron triggers .",
    "each valid t1 signal without the gc signal would produce a 150-ns wide pion gate signal that allowed an output to be formed by the logical or modules from the preliminary pion triggers .",
    "the outputs of the logical and and or modules are called group electron and pion triggers , respectively .",
    "all six ( eight ) group electron or pion triggers were then ored together to form the global electron or pion trigger for the left ( right ) hrs .",
    "all group and the final electron and pion triggers were counted using scalers . because pions do not produce large enough lead - glass signals to trigger the high threshold ts discriminators for the electron triggers",
    ", pions do not introduce extra counting deadtime for the electron triggers .",
    "however , the 150-ns width of the electron gate signal would cause pion contamination in the electron trigger .",
    "this effect will be presented in section  [ sec : pid ] .    in order to monitor the counting deadtime of the daq",
    ", two identical paths of electronics were constructed .",
    "the only difference between the two paths is in the ps and the ts discriminator output widths , set at 30  ns and 100  ns for the `` narrow '' and the `` wide '' paths , respectively .",
    "the scalers are rated for 250 mhz ( 4  ns deadtime ) and therefore do not add to the deadtime .",
    "in addition , the output width of all logic modules was set to 15  ns , so the deadtime of the daq for each group is dominated by the deadtime of the discriminators .",
    "detailed analysis of the daq deadtime will be presented in section  [ sec : deadtime ] .",
    "the sum8 modules used for summing all lead - glass signals also served as fan - out modules , providing exact copies of the input pmt signals .",
    "these copies were sent to the standard hrs daq for calibration . during the experiment ,",
    "data were collected at low rates using reduced beam currents with both daqs functioning , such that a direct comparison of the two daqs could be made .",
    "vertical drift chambers were used during these low rate daq studies .",
    "outputs from all discriminators , signals from the scintillator and the gas cherenkov , and all electron and pion group and global triggers were sent to fastbus tdcs ( fbtdc ) and were recorded in the standard daq .",
    "data from these fbtdcs were used to align the amplitude spectrum and timing of all signals .",
    "they also allowed the study of the cherenkov and the lead - glass detector performance for the new daq .",
    "full sampling of partial analog signals was done using flash - adcs ( fadcs ) at low rates intermittently during the experiment . for one group on the left and one group on the right hrs ,",
    "the preshower and the shower sum8 outputs , the intermediate logical signals of the daq , and the output electron and pion triggers were recorded .",
    "these fadc data provided a study of pileup effects to confirm the deadtime simulation and to provide the input parameters for the simulation , specifically the rise and fall times of the signals and their widths .",
    "during the experiment data were taken at two deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) kinematics at @xmath62 and @xmath34  ( gev/@xmath11)@xmath12 . these were the main production kinematics and will be referred to as dis#1 and dis#2 , respectively . due to limitation of the spectrometer magnets ,",
    "dis#1 was taken only on the left hrs , while dis#2 was taken on both left and right hrss .",
    "in addition , data were taken at five kinematics within or near the nucleon resonance region with their invariant mass @xmath63 between the @xmath64 resonance and just above @xmath65  gev .",
    "these data were used for the purpose of radiative corrections and will be referred to as res i through v ( although kinematics v was located slightly above @xmath65  gev ) .",
    "data for each of the resonance settings were taken only with one hrs because of the spectrometer magnet limitations as well as to optimize the beam time allocation .",
    "the kinematic settings are shown in table  [ tab : kine ] along with the observed electron rate @xmath66 and the pion to electron ratio @xmath67 in the hrs .",
