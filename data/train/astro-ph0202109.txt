    "in her x-1 , x - rays are being generated by the infall of plasma from a @xmath10 star ( hz her ) onto a @xmath11 neutron star ( @xcite ) .",
    "the neutron star pulsates in the x - ray band with period @xmath12 ( @xcite ) . the thermal emission observed in the soft x - ray band ,",
    "the large luminosity of the system ( @xmath13 erg s@xmath1 ) , and the observed broad uv emission lines ( @xcite ) , all indicate the mass transfer is being mediated by an accretion disk .",
    "her x-1 is unusually well placed for soft x - ray and uv observations , since it is @xmath14  kpc above the galactic plane while at a distance of @xmath15  kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "an orbital period of @xmath16 can be measured from x - ray eclipses ( @xcite ) .",
    "one of our main goals is to find the spectral signatures of a precessing accretion disk .",
    "the her x-1 system goes through high and low x - ray flux states in an almost periodic fashion , with a @xmath17  d pseudo - period ( @xcite ) .",
    "variability as a function of @xmath18 has also been observed in the optical light curves ( @xcite ) , x - ray pulse shapes ( @xcite ) , x - ray dips ( @xcite ) , and x - ray spectra ( @xcite and this paper ) .",
    "the @xmath18-phase has been associated with disk precession ( @xcite ) .",
    "only a handful of other x - ray sources are known to exhibit such pseudo - periodicities , and her x-1 is the brightest of the group . the binary system is being observed nearly edge - on , at an inclination angle of @xmath19 .",
    "models of the disk atmosphere and corona ( @xcite ) show that its line emission is detectable , especially at large @xmath20 and in binaries with large ( @xmath21  cm ) disks .",
    "her x-1 is also a prime object to study the interaction of an accretion disk with a strong magnetic field ( @xmath22 g from @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "three observations with the _ xmm - newton reflection grating spectrometer ( @xmath23 ) , during the low , short - on and main - on states , reveal recombination line and continuum emission in her x-1 . we find dramatic spectral changes through the 35  d cycle , including changes in the continuum , line fluxes , and line widths .",
    "the high resolution x - ray spectra unveil two new components inside the her x-1 system : _    1 .   a photoionized narrow - line region , with velocity broadening @xmath24  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the density of this material is @xmath25  cm , with the lowest temperatures in the @xmath26  k range .",
    "we set an upper bound for the radius of this region of @xmath27  cm , just outside the @xmath28  cm roche lobe radius .",
    "2 .   a photoionized broad - line region evidenced by he@xmath2 lines with velocity broadening @xmath29  km  s@xmath1 . if the broadening is due to orbital velocity , this region is between @xmath30  cm .",
    "we estimate the density of this region to be @xmath31  @xmath8 .      the low and short - on state spectra consist of a power - law continuum plus radiative recombination ( @xmath32 ) emission .",
    "the brightest line features have a velocity broadening @xmath0  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the count rate in the short - on is twice as that in the low state , for both continuum and most lines .",
    "the , , and triplet ratios indicate the gas is photoionized ( section [ mjimenez - c1:secdiag ] ) .",
    "the power - law continuum is probably due to compton scattering of the neutron star x - rays in the accretion disk corona and/or on the face of the companion .",
    "the variation of the x - ray line flux with 35  d phase , vis - a - vis the expected accretion disk inclination from @xcite , suggests that at least half of the line emission originates on the face of the companion .",
    "if the accretion disk atmosphere and corona are the only source of x - ray lines , then we expect the outer - disk inclination @xmath33 to be in disagreement with the @xcite values . as the disk precesses from @xmath34 to @xmath35",
    ", the observed lines should increase their flux and broadening , because the inner - disk becomes unobstructed by the outer - disk ( @xcite ) . according to the @xmath36 from @xcite , the disk was more edge - on during the short - on than during the low state observation .",
    "if the line emission originates on the hz her , this can be explained by shadowing from the disk .",
    "the main - on state in the 538    band is dominated by a smooth continuum and a broad continuum `` bump '' previously identified with fe l line emission ( see figure [ mjimenez - c1_fig : main ] ) .",
    "most of the soft x - ray continuum originates from reprocessing on the disk , judging by its sinusoidal pulse profile .",
    "the sharply peaked pulse profile observed below @xmath37    ( @xcite ) , indicates the emission region is compact ( @xmath38  cm ) , and near the neutron star .",
    "the 1015    `` bump '' does not contain any obvious fe l lines .",
    "the continuum shape is complex and has not been successfully fitted yet with a model .",
    "weaker , discrete spectral features are present as well . a surprisingly broad he@xmath2 line complex , with @xmath39  kms@xmath1 , is centered on the @xmath20 line , and is consistent with the line ratios observed in the low and short - on states .",
    "a weaker , similarly broad ly@xmath2 line may also be present .",
    "high density plasma funneled out of the disk by the magnetic field forms a magnetospheric shell which may produce recombination emission as it is blasted by pulsar x - rays . if the magnetospheric ions are fully stripped of electrons , photons which are compton scattered by those electrons may illuminate the neighboring disk and produce recombination ( see figure [ mjimenez - c1_fig : mag ] ) .",
    "a 1s-2p resonant absorption feature from atomic o is detected .",
    "a neutral o edge is mostly instrumental in nature . the second order effective area also seems overestimated by the calibration below @xmath37   , if we take the first order as reference .",
    "there is marginal evidence for a complex line shape , possibly a p cygni with @xmath40  km  s@xmath1 , in ly@xmath2 ( figure [ mjimenez - c1_fig : main ] ) .",
    "p cygni profiles for winds with velocities of @xmath41  km  s@xmath1 have been found by @xcite in the uv .",
    "the upper bounds for the fluxes of unresolved lines are below those observed in the low and short - on states , for many of the lines ( see figure [ mjimenez - c1_fig : lowsh ] )",
    ". this may be due to an orbital phase ( @xmath42 ) dependence of the line fluxes , since the main - on observation was performed at @xmath43 , while the other two observations were obtained at @xmath44 , suggesting the narrow lines originate on hz her .",
    "we use five kinds of spectral diagnostics :    1 .   the @xmath45 ratio in he - like ion line triplets .",
    "the triplet consists of a resonance ( @xmath46 ) , intercombination ( @xmath20 ) and a forbidden ( @xmath47 ) line .",
    "the plasma is found to be dominated by photoionization since the @xmath48 .",
    "in contrast , collisional plasmas have @xmath49 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath50 line ratio as density diagnostic in he - like ions . when the density is higher than some threshold , @xmath51 , while in the low density limit , @xmath52 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we observe @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath54 ratio as uv radiation probe in he - like ions .",
    "excitation by uv photons can also explain @xmath51 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we find photoexcitation competes with electron impact excitation .",
    "using uv photometry from @xcite , we set @xmath27  cm for the radius of the line emission region .",
    "temperature diagnostics with the radiative recombination continuum ( @xmath55 ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the width of the @xmath55 is proportional to the electron temperature . for and",
    ", we find @xmath56  ev and @xmath57  ev , respectively .",
    "model calculations with @xmath58 v.2.1d ( @xcite ) show @xmath59  ev for and .",
    "5 .   using the ionization parameter , and assuming thermal and ionization balance in the optically thin case , we constrain the density to @xmath60  @xmath8 for the narrow line region , and @xmath61  @xmath8 for the broad line region of the main - on state .",
    "we use the limits on the distance to the pulsar that we set from photoexcitation and from velocity broadening .",
    "this analysis allows us to measure or set limits on the density , geometry , and element abundances of the emission regions .",
    "we use plasma and spectral models together with a phenomenological emission measure distribution to fit the observed line fluxes .",
    "the emission measure , @xmath62 , equals the volume times the density squared .",
    "the @xmath63 is proportional to the recombination line flux .",
    "the @xmath63 may vary as a function of the ionization parameter @xmath64 . to fit the line",
    "fluxes , we need the differential emission measure @xmath65 ( as defined in @xcite ) .",
    "we use recombination rates calculated by liedahl ( private communication ) with the @xmath66 atomic code ( @xcite ) .    in one model ,",
    "the emission measure is constant with respect to @xmath67 , while in a second model , we let the @xmath68 vary as a power law of @xmath67 .",
    "the results of model 1 , shown in figure [ mjimenez - c1_fig : em ] , show that element abundance ratios differ from the solar values .",
    "the @xmath68 of n and o is seen to depend on the charge state , invalidating model 1 .",
    "the line flux variability , however , is well - represented by figure [ mjimenez - c1_fig : em ] . unlike the flat-@xmath68 model 1 , the power - law @xmath68 model 2 achieves self - consistency , and from it , element abundance ratios are extracted .",
    "we find @xmath5 = 0.68 \\pm 0.16 $ ] , @xmath4 = 9.9 \\pm 1.3 $ ] and @xmath6 = 2.4 \\pm 1.0 $ ] times solar for the low state data , using the solar abundances from @xcite .",
    "nitrogen is significantly enriched , indicating cno processing in hz her . a lower limit of @xmath69 @xmath8 is estimated from model 1 for the broad line region , by using the maximum volume deduced from velocity broadening .",
    "the x - ray emission lines from her x-1 are weak , but they provide a wealth of information on gas which is too hot to observe at other wavelengths and which may be very close to the neutron star . by use of models ,",
    "the x - ray spectrum yields more accurate element abundance ratios between c , n , o , and ne , constraining the historical nuclear burning in hz her",
    ". the temperature can be measured , and limits on the density and geometry of the gas are set . two dynamically distinct photoionized regions are identified .",
    "a low dispersion velocity region may be the accretion disk atmosphere and corona , or the illuminated face of hz her .",
    "the high dispersion velocity region , albeit weakly detected , may be dense material in the magnetosphere or its neighboring inner - disk .",
    "the high resolution x - ray spectrum of her x-1 varies dramatically with 35  d phase , presumably due to the precession of the accretion disk .",
    "this spectral variability may help us determine the inclination - dependence of spectra from other x - ray binaries with disks .",
    "many features known to be present in the spectrum of photoionized gases have not been detected due to the low signal - to - noise of these data .",
    "in particular , the lyman series lines provide constraints on the column density and line optical depth , and accurate measurements of the @xmath55 verify the validity of the plasma equilibrium calculations used here .",
    "this will allow us to identify the source of the line emission and further investigate the environment around accreting neutron stars ."
