    "dense packings of nonoverlapping solid objects or particles are ubiquitous in synthetic and natural situations .",
    "packing problems arise in technological contexts , such as the packaging industries , agriculture ( e.g. , grains in silos ) , and solid - rocket propellants , and underlie the structure of a multitude of biological systems ( e.g. , tissue structure , cell membranes , and phyllotaxis ) .",
    "dense particle packings are intimately related to the structure of low - temperature states of condensed matter , such as liquids , glasses and crystals @xcite . in the last decade , scientific attention has broadened from the study of dense packings of spheres ( the simplest shape that does not tile euclidean space ) @xcite to dense packings of disordered @xcite and ordered @xcite nonspherical particles . in addition , the equilibrium phase behavior and transport properties of hard nonspherical particles have been of topics of great interest @xcite .",
    "nonsphericity introduces rotational degrees of freedom not present in sphere packings , and can dramatically alter the characteristics from those of sphere packings .    a basic characteristic of a packing in @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space @xmath2 is its density @xmath3 , defined to be the fraction of @xmath2 that is covered by the particles .",
    "a problem that has been of great scientific interest for centuries is the determination of the densest arrangement(s ) of particles that do not tile space and the associated maximal density @xmath4 . for generally shaped particles ,",
    "finding the densest packings is notoriously difficult .",
    "this salient point is summarized well by henry cohn @xcite who recently remarked , `` for most grain shapes we can not guess or even closely approximate the answer , let alone prove it , and it is difficult to develop even a qualitative understanding of the effects of grain shape on packing density . '' until recently , very little was known about the densest packings of polyhedral particles .",
    "the difficulty in obtaining dense packings of polyhedra is related to their complex rotational degrees of freedom and to the non - smooth nature of their shapes @xcite .",
    "recently , we set out to attempt to determine the densest known packings of the platonic and archimedean solids @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the central symmetry of the majority of the platonic and archimedean solids distinguish their dense packing arrangements from those of the non - centrally symmetric ones in a fundamental way .",
    "( a particle is centrally symmetric if it has a center @xmath5 that bisects every chord through @xmath5 connecting any two boundary points of the particle ; i.e. , the center is a point of inversion symmetry . )",
    "the tetrahedron is the only platonic solid that lacks central symmetry , an attribute that geometrically frustrates it to a greater degree than the majority of the remaining solids in this set that do not tile space @xcite .",
    "a number of organizing principles emerged in the form of conjectures for polyhedra as well as other nonspherical shapes . in the case of polyhedra ,",
    "the following three are particularly relevant and will be applied later in the paper to remark on the optimality of tetrahedron packings :    * * conjecture 1 * : _ the densest packings of the centrally symmetric platonic and archimedean solids are given by their corresponding optimal bravais lattice packings .",
    "_ * * conjecture 2 * : _ the densest packing of any convex , congruent polyhedron without central symmetry generally is not a bravais lattice packing , i.e. , the set of such polyhedra whose optimal packing is not a bravais lattice is overwhelmingly larger than the set whose optimal packing is a bravais lattice . _ * * conjecture 3 * : _ the densest packings of congruent , centrally symmetric particles that do not possesses three equivalent principle axes ( e.g. , ellipsoids ) generally can not be bravais lattices . _",
    "conjecture 1 is the analog of kepler s sphere conjecture for the centrally symmetric platonic and archimedean solids . in this sense , such solids",
    "behave similarly to spheres in that their densest packings are lattice arrangements and ( except for the cube and the truncated octahedron ) are geometrically frustrated like spheres .",
    "conjecture 2 has been shown by conway and torquato @xcite to be true for both the tetrahedron and archimedean non - centrally symmetric truncated tetrahedron , the latter of which can be arranged in a  uniform \" non - bravais lattice packing with density at least as high as @xmath6 .",
    "( a _ uniform _ packing has a symmetry operation , in this case the point inversion symmetry , that takes any particle into another . )",
    "although conjecture 3 is explicitly stated in its current form here for the first time , it was strongly implied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it was conway and torquato s investigation @xcite that has spurred the flurry of activity in the last several years to find the densest packings of tetrahedra .",
    "there have been many twists and unexpected turns since 2006 that have led to the dense packings of tetrahedra that we report here .",
    "therefore , to place our present results in their proper context , it is instructive to review briefly the developments since 2006 .",

    "conway and torquato @xcite showed that the densest packings of tetrahedra can not be bravais lattices by analytically constructing several such packings with densities that are substantially larger than @xmath9 .",

    "torquato and jiao @xcite devised and applied an optimization scheme , called the adaptive - shrinking - cell ( asc ) method , that used an initial configuration based on the wagon - wheels packing to yield a non - bravais lattice packing consisting of 72 tetrahedra per fundamental cell with a density @xmath16 @xcite . using 314 particles per fundamental cell and starting from an  equilibrated \" low - density liquid configuration ,",

    "a uniform dimer packing of tetrahedra takes any dimer via a point - inversion symmetry operation into another . )",

    "inspired by the work of kallus et al .",
    "@xcite , we have applied the adaptive - shrinking - cell ( asc ) optimization scheme to examine comprehensively packings with a considerably small number of particles per fundamental cell ( from 2 to 32 ) than we have used in the past @xcite .",
    "the asc scheme employs both a sequential search of the configurational space of the particles and the space of lattices via an adaptive fundamental cell that deforms and shrinks on average to obtain dense packings .",
    "a dense packing with 8-particle basis that emerged from this numerical investigation suggested that it was composed of two very similar fundamental cells , each containing 4 particles .",
    "using one of the 4-particle basis configurations , we were able to find packings with density @xmath22 that exceeded the highest density packings with @xmath23 constructed by kallus _",
    "_ even though our packings possess a type of point inversion symmetry , they are not as symmetric as the densest packings reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , as we now explain .",
    "the four tetrahedra in the fundamental cell in our dense numerically generated packings formed two contacting `` dimers '' .",
    "a dimer is composed of a pair of regular tetrahedra with unit edge length that exactly share a common face .",
    "the compound object consisting of the two contacting dimers possesses point inversion symmetry , with the inversion center at the centroid of the contacting region on the faces .",
    "a bravais lattice possesses point inversion symmetry about the lattice points and the centroids of the fundamental cells . by placing the symmetry center of the two - dimer compound on the centroids ( or the lattice points ) ,",
    "we construct packings that generally possess point inversion symmetry only about the symmetry centers of the two - dimer compound . besides the centroids of the fundamental cell , all of the half - integer lattice points are also inversion symmetry centers of the packing .",
    "we call such structures _ dimer - uniform _ packings , since the inversion symmetry acts to take any _ dimer _ into another .",
    "such packings should be distinguished from the more symmetric _ uniform _ ( or transitive ) packings of tetrahedra in which the symmetry operation acts to take any _ tetrahedron _ into another , such as the ones found in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the latter have almost as much symmetry as a bravais lattice , except that the centroids of the particles are not just characterized by simple translational symmetry .",
    "we now describe our general analytical formulation to construct dense tetrahedron packings by relaxing the symmetry conditions on the contacting dimers in detail .",
    "in particular , we orient the 3-fold rotational symmetry axis of one of the dimers in an arbitrary direction ( say the @xmath24-direction of a cartesian coordinate system ) , and then fix the origin of the lattice vectors at the centroid of this dimer .",
    "( the centroid is located at the center of the contacting faces of the two tetrahedra that comprise the dimer . )",
    "then we place the second dimer in contact with the first one such that there is a center of inversion symmetry that takes one dimer to the other , which implies a face - to - face contact between the two dimers .",
    "the problem of determining the analytical constructions then amounts to determining 12 equations for the 12 unknowns .",
    "nine of the 12 unknowns arise from the three unknown lattice vectors , each of which contains three unknown components .",
    "the other 3 unknowns derive from the components of the centroid of the second dimer .",

    "the fact that the regular tetrahedron has the best density for any tetrahedron , then yields an upper bound for the density of any sphere packing . in the case of the non - tiling platonic and archimedean solids ,",
    "a natural choice for the enclosing region associated with the cluster is its convex hull .",
    "@xmath166{fig5a.eps } & \\includegraphics[height=5.5 cm , keepaspectratio]{fig5b.eps } \\\\",
    "\\mbox{(a ) } & \\mbox{(b ) } \\end{array}$ ]    for tetrahedra , we must identify the densest local cluster with density that exceeds or equals @xmath4 while taking into account their shape symmetry .",
    "a trivial choice is a dimer because the fraction of space covered by the dimer within its convex hull is unity .",
    "two nontrivial choices are the 5-particle  wagon - wheel \" cluster as shown in fig .",
    "[ wagon](a ) and a more  isotropic \" icosahedron - like cluster ( a cluster consisting of 20 tetrahedra that share a common vertex ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ wagon](b ) .",
    "the `` wagon - wheel '' and icosahedron - like cluster can be considered to be the most anisotropic and isotropic densest local clusters , respectively .",
    "the former is essentially a  flat \" ( quasi - two - dimensional ) structure . since neither of the two local clusters can tile space , their local packing densities , which are computed below , provide limiting estimates on upper bounds for @xmath4 .",
    "the convex hull of the `` wagon - wheel '' cluster composed of five tetrahedra sharing a common edge ( a `` wagon wheel '' cluster ) can be decomposed into five regular tetrahedra and five thin irregular tetrahedra .",
    "we assume the gaps between the regular tetrahedra are equal , i.e , the thin irregular tetrahedra are congruent .",
    "note the regular tetrahedron shares two faces with its neighboring irregular tetrahedra .",
    "thus , the volume ratio is equal to the ratio of the corresponding heights of the regular and irregular tetrahedron , i.e. , @xmath167 where @xmath168 and @xmath169 is the volume of the regular and irregular tetrahedron , respectively .",
    "thus , the density of this local packing , defined as the fraction space covered by the regular tetrahedra within the convex hull is given by @xmath170 because this cluster is highly anisotropic and is an effectively  flat \" object , it is reasonable to assume that it is not the least densest local cluster and therefore its local density is likely to be gross overestimate of the best upper bound on @xmath4 .",
    "it seems reasonable to suppose that the least densest local cluster with the highest shape symmetry is one consisting of 20 tetrahedra sharing a common vertex , i.e. , an icosahedron - like cluster .",
    "the convex hull of such a cluster can be decomposed into 20 regular tetrahedra , 12 pyramids with pentagonal bases and 30 pyramid with rectangular bases [ see fig .",
    "[ wagon](b ) ] .",
    "we assume the gaps between tetrahedra are equal and thus the two types of pyramids are congruent .",
    "the volume of the regular tetrahedron is @xmath171 and the volume @xmath172 of the pyramid with pentagonal base is given by    @xmath173    and the volume @xmath174 of the pyramid with rectangular base is given by    @xmath175    where    @xmath176    and @xmath177 is the golden ratio .",
    "thus , the local packing density is given by    @xmath178    note in the above calculations , we have assumed that the gaps between the tetrahedra are equal , which is sufficient to provide an estimate of the fraction of space covered by the cluster within its convex hull .",
    "it is noteworthy that the icosahedron - like cluster of 20 tetrahedra is at least a local extremum , i.e. , adding or removing a tetrahedron from the cluster will decrease the local packing density .",
    "moreover , adding another `` shell '' of tetrahedra around the icosahedron - like cluster will also reduce the local packing density .",
    "we note that the idea of rogers to prove an upper bound for sphere packings can not be used here because there is no analogous decomposition of space into irregular convex hulls shown in fig .",
    "[ wagon](a ) or ( b ) .",
    "a completely new idea is needed to prove that the aforementioned estimates are bounds . if one could prove that these clusters are indeed locally denser than the globally densest packings , then the aforementioned estimates provide upper bounds on @xmath4 , but they can not be sharp , i.e. , they are not achievable by any packings . without loss of generality ,",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the globally densest packings of tetrahedra contain a particular proportion of both the isotropic and anisotropic local clusters .",
    "therefore , these limiting estimates provide a plausible range of upper bounds , i.e. , @xmath179 $ ] .",
    "it is noteworthy that the density @xmath180 of the densest known packings of tetrahedra is relatively close to this putative lower - limit upper bound density estimate of @xmath181 .",
    "for all of the small periodic packings that we investigated ( including 2 to 32 particles per fundamental cell ) using our numerical asc scheme , the densest packings that emerged had a 4-particle basis .",
    "the numerical optimization that we performed of our six - parameter family of tetrahedron packings verified the optimality of the densest 4-particle packing with density @xmath182 .",
    "are these dimer packings optimal among all packings ? this is a difficult question to answer in any definitive way .",
    "we first note that the two contacting dimers in the fundamental cell possess center inversion symmetry and thus they can be viewed as a centrally symmetric compound object .",
    "hence , our two - parameter family of packings for the two - dimers ( and the densest known packings ) are bravais lattice packings of such compound objects .",
    "thus , it is not very surprising that dense bravais lattice packings of this centrally symmetric compound object have a fairly high density based on the arguments leading to conjectures 1 and 2 @xcite , i.e. , there are a large number of face - to - face contacts which are made possible due to the central symmetry of the compound object and bring the centroids of the objects closer to each other .",
    "however , conjecture 3 states that central symmetry alone does not guarantee optimality of the densest bravais lattice packings among all packings .",
    "that is , there are additional constraints on the geometry and shape of the objects , e.g. , they might also need to possess three equivalent principal axes , as do the centrally symmetric platonic and archimedean solids .",
    "when the latter condition does not hold , there could exist non - bravais lattice packings that are denser than the optimal lattice packings ( e.g. , ellipsoids @xcite ) .",
    "the 4-tetrahedron compound object is very anisotropic and does not possess equivalent principal axes .",
    "moreover , it is a _ concave _ object rather than convex , which makes it even more difficult to make a definitive conclusion about the optimality of the densest dimer packings .",
    "in addition , haji - akbari _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have found periodic packings of tetrahedra consisting of 82 particles per fundamental cell with a slightly lower density ( i.e. , @xmath183 ) than that of the densest dimer packings .",
    "their packings possess much larger fundamental cells with distinctly different and more complicated particle arrangements than the dimer packings .",
    "this suggests that there is a large degeneracy of different non - bravais lattice packing structures with high densities with various levels of complexity and perhaps even higher densities than the optimal 4-particle packings .",
    "such denser packings could be discovered by carrying out exhaustive searches to determine the globally maximal densities of packings with successively larger numbers of particles per fundamental cell .",
    "previous numerical studies have indicated that dense packings may have a large number of particles per fundamental cell arranged in a complex fashion , e.g. , the  disordered wagon - wheels \" packing with @xmath184 @xcite and the  ring stacks \" packing with @xmath185 @xcite",
    ". however , it is now clear that such packings are in fact only locally optimal solutions and hence the numerical techniques used to obtain them are incapable of extricating themselves from these  trapped \" regions of configuration space to find denser and more ordered structures due to the intrinsic geometrical frustration of the tetrahedron mentioned earlier .",
    "this may also call into question claims made by haji - akbari _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite that their packings , which are characterized by an effective  quasicrystal - like \" plane , are true thermodynamic equilibrium phases of tetrahedra at high densities . instead , our high - density constructions suggest that uniform periodic packings with a 4-particle basis ( or even some yet unknown denser periodic packing ) and their unjammmed , lower - density counterparts could be the stable phases at high densities .",
    "if the latter is correct and the putative  quasicrystal - like \" phase truly exists at intermediate densities , then it is hard to imagine how such complex quasicrystal - like structures of tetrahedra under quasi - static compression ( densification ) could rearrange themselves at higher densities to spontaneously form a more ordered periodic arrangement with higher symmetry .",
    "however , it is difficult to draw any such definitive conclusions without further study .",
    "although there could still be tetrahedron packings denser than our constructions , it appears that all of the evidence thus far points to the fact that the densest tetrahedron packings can not possess very high symmetry @xcite due to the lack of central symmetry of a tetrahedron and because tetrahedra can not tile space @xcite .",
    "indeed , the dense 4-particle - basis packings found in the present paper improved upon the best dimer packings of kallus _ et al . _",
    "@xcite by relaxing the two - fold rotational symmetry constraints they imposed .",
    "we are grateful to henry cohn , yoav kallus and john conway for helpful discussions .",
