    "the dissipative two - level system ( tls ) has quite a rich and long history of both experimental and theoretical investigations @xcite . despite its simplicity , it is a very prominent candidate for modeling various different situations in physics as well as in chemistry and provides a testing ground for exploring dissipation and decoherence effects in genuine quantum - mechanical systems .",
    "the development of maser and laser technology triggered the examination of those systems under the influence of strong time - dependent driving fields , which yields dressed tls states @xcite in turn leading to a variety of phenomena like coherent destruction of tunneling ( cdt ) @xcite or driving - induced tunneling oscillations ( dito ) @xcite .",
    "for taking into account the influence of the environment , the driven spin - boson model @xcite has proven to be a suitable candidate.in recent years , the driven tls has experienced a strong revival in the field of quantum computation , as lithographic fabrication techniques allow the construction of artificial atoms that are coupled to the modes of an oscillating field by a strength never reached in real atoms . here",
    "the tls implements the two logical states of a qubit .",
    "we mention just two prominent solid - state realizations of the qubit , namely , the cooper - pair box @xcite and the josephson flux qubit @xcite",
    ". strong coupling between the tls and a single oscillator photon was first successfully reported in @xcite for a charge qubit . in this weak driving limit",
    ", the oscillator is usually described in its quantized version and occupied by a small number of photons @xcite .",
    "recently , a lot of theoretical effort has been put into solving the dynamics of such a system @xcite . also for strong",
    "driving , the applied field can still be described by a quantized oscillator . however , for high photon numbers , the tls - oscillator system is conveniently treated in the dressed state picture @xcite . in this strong driving regime ,",
    "a series of experiments and theoretical investigations have been performed recently on superconducting qubits examining rabi oscillations in the multiphoton regime and the validity of the dressed state picture @xcite . to account for environmental effects ,",
    "the latter is usually combined with the phenomenological bloch equations @xcite . with the applied field being in a coherent state and for high photon numbers , an equivalent description consists in replacing the quantized oscillator by an external , classical driving @xcite . together with the coupling to a bath of harmonic oscillators , it leads to the driven spin - boson model @xcite , which has been examined by applying various techniques .",
    "for example , the ( real - time ) path - integral formalism provides a formal , exact generalized master equation for the dynamics of the reduced density matrix of the tls , which can be solved approximately for certain parameter regimes @xcite . among those treatments , the noninteracting blip approximation ( niba ) @xcite is the most prominent one and is based on an expansion to lowest order in the tunneling matrix element of the undisturbed tls .",
    "it provides good approximate results for intermediate to high bath temperatures and/or strong damping of the system with arbitrary driving frequencies .",
    "however , at low temperature it fails to reproduce the dynamics of a biased tls correctly . in @xcite",
    ", the polaron transformation leads to an integro - differential kinetic equation for the populations of the density matrix , which is equivalent to the generalized master equation under the niba .",
    "an alternative way to gain the dynamics of the driven spin - boson model for weak system - bath coupling and within the markovian limit is to solve the underlying bloch - redfield equations .",
    "this is done numerically for weak damping in @xcite , while @xcite additionally provide an analytical examination of the dynamics in the high - frequency regime.in this work we introduce a new approach to solving the dynamics of the monochromatically driven spin - boson model taking into account analytically the fast oscillations induced by the driving as well as the transient dynamics . in a first step ,",
    "we combine floquet theory @xcite with van vleck perturbation theory @xcite to derive the dynamics of the nondissipative system .",
    "this approach has recently been used also in @xcite to evaluate the time - averaged transition probability of a nondissipative tls .",
    "going to second - order in the tunneling matrix element , we derive expressions which include the fast oscillatory behavior of the floquet states and are beyond the common rotating - wave results @xcite or perturbation theory in the driving strength @xcite .",
    "further , to analyze dissipative effects , we consider the regime of weak damping and solve the corresponding floquet - bloch - redfield master equation applying a moderate rotating - wave approximation . while in @xcite a similar approach",
    "is used to study the asymptotic dynamics of the driven spin - boson model perturbatively in the driving strength , our approach treats the full time evolution of the system , to all orders in the driving amplitude , in the regime of moderate as well as high external frequencies and for arbitrary static bias .",
    "specifically , we are able to give closed analytic expressions for both the relaxation and dephasing rates .",
    "our analysis enables us to shed light on the famous effects of cdt @xcite and dito @xcite .",
    "many investigations of those phenomena have been performed in the high - driving regime .",
    "this work treats them analytically also for moderate driving frequency and amplitude .",
    "we examine both the nondissipative and dissipative cases and compare them to a numerical solution of the problem.the structure of the work is a follows . in sec .",

    "we discuss two approximation schemes .",
    "a rotating - wave approximation scheme is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec::rwa ] , while in sec .",
    "[ sec::vanvleck ] van vleck perturbation theory is presented .",
    "we also show that the rwa results can be obtained with van vleck perturbation theory to lowest order in @xmath5 .",
    "let us look at the spectrum of the unperturbed problem ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "we notice that whenever the static bias fulfills the condition @xmath25 , the states @xmath26 and @xmath27 are degenerate , as then @xmath28 in this case , we speak of an @xmath29-photon resonance . as long as @xmath5 is only a small perturbation , @xmath30",
    ", then @xmath21 will exhibit a similar energy spectrum .",
    "the main corrections to the unperturbed hamiltonian come from matrix elements connecting the ( almost ) degenerate levels .",
    "thus , as a first approximation , we diagonalize an effective hamiltonian , which consists of 2 @xmath31 2 blocks of the kind @xmath32 and describes the energy states being connected by an @xmath29-photon resonance .",
    "this result is also obtained within the rwa scheme as introduced in @xcite . in those works , the _ time - dependent _ system hamiltonian ( [ freehamil ] )",
    "is transformed to a rotating frame , and only terms fulfilling the resonance condition ( [ rescond ] ) are kept , while the fast - rotating components are neglected .",
    "this rwa is different from the conventional _ rabi rotating - wave approximation , _ which is perturbative in the driving amplitude @xmath7 , see , e.g. , @xcite , and becomes exact for circularly polarized radiation .",
    "in contrast , the rwa we are using treats the driving amplitude nonperturbatively .",
    "concerning the eigenenergies of the floquet hamiltonian for finite @xmath5 , we notice that the exact crossing of the unperturbed energies ( @xmath33 ) at @xmath25 becomes an avoided crossing ( see fig . [ fig::avoided_crossing ] ) and",
    "the perturbed eigenstates are a mixture of the unperturbed ones . those with higher eigenenergies are labeled @xmath34 ; those with lower energies @xmath35 .",
    "and @xmath36 of the perturbed eigenstates in this way is that they agree with the ones of the unperturbed states for @xmath37 .",

    "furthermore , we will show that the couplings between the nondegenerate states in ( [ floquetmatrix ] ) are needed to get physically correct expressions for the relaxation and dephasing rates . in the following",
    ", we will use van vleck perturbation theory to go beyond those shortcomings . originally",
    "this method was used to treat modifications on diatomic molecules caused by vibrations and rotations of the nuclei @xcite . since",
    "then the formalism has found many applications in both chemistry and physics and experienced various modifications ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the main formalism behind these different variants is , however , always the same : a unitary transformation @xmath46 is applied in order to construct an effective hamiltonian which exhibits , to a certain order in the perturbation , the same eigenenergies as the original hamiltonian but only connects almost degenerate levels . in this work",
    "we choose for the transformation the form @xmath47 , which was originally proposed by kemble in @xcite and is described in more detail in @xcite . in the case of the floquet hamiltonian ,",

( [ vanvleckcondsmallarg ] ) is fulfilled for any @xmath82 if it is satisfied for @xmath83 ; i.e. , if @xmath84 in the case of a 1-photon resonance , this leaves us with the rwa condition , @xmath30 , as then nearest neighbor doublets are connected by a @xmath85 element in the floquet matrix which approaches @xmath5 for small @xmath74 .",
    "all other perturbative off - diagonal entries in ( [ floquetmatrix ] ) are vanishingly small . in the case of an @xmath29-photon resonance with @xmath86 , the dressed element @xmath85 connects more distant doublets , so that the van vleck condition ( [ vanvleckcond ] ) can be realized according to ( [ vanvleckcondsmallarg2 ] ) for frequencies smaller than the ones demanded by the rwa.in the opposite limit of @xmath87 , an upper bound for the dressed bessel function is @xcite @xmath88 using this , we find that ( [ vanvleckcond ] ) is verified if @xmath89 since @xmath90 , it follows that @xmath91 and thus @xmath92 . hence , eq . ( [ vanvleckasymp ] ) represents an improvement to the rwa condition.further , being close to an @xmath29-photon resonance , one single frequency will dominate the system s behavior , and thus neglecting the remaining fast - oscillating terms will already give a good picture of the coarse - grained dynamics . this dominating frequency",
    "is represented by @xmath93 and by @xmath94 in the case of the rwa and the second - order van vleck perturbation theory , respectively . to obtain those frequencies ,",
    "it is enough to diagonalize the corresponding effective hamiltonian , without yet considering any modification of the eigenstates of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "as shown in the previous subsection , @xmath93 corresponds to the main frequency of the system obtained by applying van vleck perturbation theory to first order in @xmath5 .",
    "naturally the question arises as to how good these approximations are , or which orders in @xmath5 are necessary depending on the parameter regime.in a first step , we examine the improvement obtained by using second - order van vleck perturbation theory compared to the rwa ; that is , we consider     obtained by the rwa and second - order van vleck frequency @xmath94 for a fixed static bias , @xmath95 .",
    "the relative mistake performing the rwa is shown against the driving frequency @xmath96 and driving amplitude @xmath97 .",

    "the lightest areas stand for a relative mistake of 15 % or more .",
    "we can tell from fig .",
    "[ fig::secondordcorr ] that the rwa fails for low driving frequencies and/or weak driving amplitudes .",
    "the darkest areas determine regions in the parameter space where almost no difference between the rwa and second - order van vleck approach can be found .",
    "of course this is no indication that the results are reliable in those areas , but rather that second - order perturbation theory yields no improvement to the rwa .",

    "[ fig::thirdordcorr ] .",
    "again we only consider mistakes up to 15 % .",

    "the agreement between second- and third - order van vleck perturbation theory is quite good apart from small islands .",
    "those islands are located at values of @xmath8 and @xmath7 where the second - order condition for coherent destruction of tunneling ( cdt ) is fulfilled , see discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec::cdt ] .",

    "this case is presented in figs .",
    "[ fig::pbetweenresonances ] and [ fig::fbetweenresonances ] , where we are in the region between the 1- and 2-photon resonances .",
    "in contrast to figs . [ fig::patresonance ] and",
