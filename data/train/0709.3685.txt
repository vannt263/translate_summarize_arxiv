    "in essence , the spin dynamics is embedded in space and our bath is too small .",
    "the coordinate hilbert space in the two - orbital ground state approximation adopted in the present paper is represented by 4 two - electron coordinate basis wavefunctions . in principle , the coordinate bath can be large in a system where couplings between excited and ground state orbitals are not negligible .",
    "this is an interesting question for future investigation : how will couplings to excited orbitals affect the non - unitary spin dynamics ?",
    "the other interesting generalization of the present model is inclusion of real environment effects , i.e. , the real stochastic bath representing the interaction of electron spins with the semiconductor medium .",
    "we will consider these and other generalizations in a future publications .    in the _ pseudo_-spin model , where @xmath70-field inhomogeneity results in first - order effects , we have estimated the contribution of the spin - orbit interaction to the effective _",
    "pseudo_-spin hamiltonian , namely the dzyaloshinskii - moriya spin - orbit interaction term , and have suggested a two - step mechanism : coupling between the singly - occupied singlet state and triplet states occurs via intermediate , double - occupancy states ( direct coupling between these states turns out to be zero due to orthogonality of the orbitals involved in the transition ) .",
    "our calculations predict a smaller magnitude of the spin - orbit interaction as compared to the estimates of ref .  , but are consistent with the results of ref .  .",
    "in our second application we demonstrated , in figs .",
    "[ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] , non - unitary effects due to @xmath307 in a system of electrons trapped above a liquid helium surface , namely the spin - based quantum computing proposal by lyon @xcite .",
    "a more thorough investigation of spin dynamics in this system is left for a future publication .    in conclusion",
    ", we note that the two - electron spin - density matrix description advocated in this paper is expected to be useful when electrons trapped in qds are not spatially resolved or resolvable .",
    "the spin - dynamics is then completely described by the spin - density matrix @xmath433 .",
    "although the @xmath433-dynamics becomes non - unitary in general ( at @xmath307 ) , it is controllable by modulating the interaction parameters , @xmath204 , @xmath168 , @xmath1 . since the non - unitarity comes from the magnetic field inhomogeneities , @xmath1 and/or @xmath215 , and since the @xmath433-dynamics is quadratically protected from these fields , this might prove to be important in practical quantum computing as minimizing coupling between spin and orbital degrees of freedom _ quadratically _ improves the fidelity of unitary gates in the @xmath433-state space ."
