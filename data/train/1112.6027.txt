    "several works have been done on time - dependent boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "diffraction in time was initially introduced by moshinsky @xcite . a beam of particles impinging from the left on a totally absorbing shutter located at the origin which is suddenly turned off at time zero .",
    "the transient current has a close mathematical resemblance with the intensity of light in the fresnel diffraction by a straight edge .",
    "an interesting feature of the solutions for cutoff initial waves , occurring both in the free case @xcite and in the presence of a potential interaction @xcite , is that , if initially there is a zero probability for the particle to be at @xmath1 , as soon as @xmath2 , there is instantaneously , a finite , though very small , probability to find the particle at any point @xmath1 .",
    "this non - local behavior of the schrdinger solution is due to its nonrelativistic nature and not a result of the quantum shutter setup @xcite .",
    "application of the klein - gordon equation to the shutter problem @xcite shows that the probability density is restricted to the accessible region @xmath3",
    "( @xmath4 is the speed of light ) .",
    "see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "gerasimov and kazarnovskii @xcite confined the initial wave in a finite region by introducing a second shutter at the point @xmath5 .",
    "godoy @xcite pointed out the analogy with fraunhoffer diffraction in the case of small box ( compared to the de broglie length ) , and fresnel diffraction , for larger confinements . in this context , by considering the problem of a particle in a one - dimensional box potential which its walls are suddenly removed at some time , the aim of the present paper is to probe some aspects of the time - dependent boundary condition for a particle confined in an square well focusing on bohmian interpretation of quantum mechanics that have remained hitherto unnoticed .",
    "the computed bohmian trajectories are instructive in revealing the conceptual ramifications of such an example .",
    "although the formalism of bohmian mechanics does not give predictions going beyond those of qm whenever the predictions of the later are unambiguous , it should be favored because of its interpretational advantages stemming from the ontological continuity between the classical and the quantum domains @xcite .",
    "noticing the bohmian arrival time formulation by means of cut - off current , it has been argued predictions of bohmain mechanics are in contradiction to the standard quantum mechanical formalism @xcite . in nonrelativistic bohmian mechanics the world",
    "is described by point - like particles which follow trajectories determined by a law of motion .",
    "the evolution of the positions of these particles are guided by a wavefunction which itself evolves according to the schrdinger equation @xcite . in this theory , in the absence of any measuring device , one finds @xcite that for those particles that actually reach @xmath6 , the arrival - time distribution is given by the modulus of the probability current density , i.e. , @xmath7 .",
    "we will proceed as follows . in sec .",

    "we take initial wavefunction to be , ( a ) a stationary state of a particle inside a well with hard ( perfect reflective ) walls at @xmath15 and @xmath5 and ( b ) a motionless localized gaussian wave - packet in that region with negligible overlap with the walls of the well . to avoid any problem concerning the boundary conditions",
    ", one can suppose in this case that the walls act as absorbers or the tails of the wave packet has been cut by the walls of the well .",

    "simultaneous removal of both walls leads at time @xmath19 to the wavefunction @xcite @xmath20 which is a superposition of a right and a left moving diffracted in time plane waves . after doing some simple algebra ,",

    "note that one can find this , without doing any algebra .",
    "wavefunction is an even ( odd ) function for odd ( even ) @xmath31 with respect to the point @xmath32 , so its derivative is an odd ( even ) function for odd ( even ) @xmath31 with respect to that point .    in the second case @xmath33}(x)$ ] ,",
    "in which @xmath34 is the center of the packet and @xmath35 is its rms width ; @xmath36 .",

    "in nonrelativistic bohmian mechanics the world is described by point - like particles which follow trajectories determined by a law of motion .",
    "the evolution of the positions of these particles are guided by a wavefunction which itself evolves according to the schrdinger equation . given the initial position @xmath38 of a particle with the initial wavefunction @xmath9 , its subsequent trajectory @xmath39",
    "is uniquely determined by simultaneous integration of the time dependent schrdinger equation , and the guidance equation @xmath40 , in which @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the probability current density and @xmath43 is the probability density . in the context of bohmian",
    "mechanics arrival time distribution at a given location , say @xmath6 is given by @xcite , @xmath44 so , mean arrival time at observation point @xmath6 is determined by , @xmath45 a general formulation for bohmian arrival times was given in @xcite and a formula for the numerical calculation of such bohmian arrival times in the case of 1d rigid inertial detectors ( exactly the cases we have here ) was presented in @xcite .",
    "the derived formula there does nt require the explicit calculation of the bohmian trajectories and the resulting ` cut - off current ' can be considered to be a generalization of the arrival time probability density introduced by leavens @xcite . according to eq .",
    "( 12 ) of @xcite , the probability density @xmath46 of the arrival time distribution for a point detector at @xmath6 takes the form , @xmath47~ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath48 is the detection probability , @xmath49 with @xmath50 for the case of positive or negative @xmath51 eq .",
    "( [ eq : ar_dis ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ eq : arr_dis ] ) .",
    "for numerical calculation width of the well is chosen as @xmath52 m . all of the calculations are presented for rubidium atoms with mass @xmath53 kg . fig . [",
    "fig : den6di ] shows probability density versus distance @xmath54 m ) for state @xmath55 at different times . at longer times",
    "there are two spatial packets placed about the box and moving apart .",
    "as pointed out by del campo and muga @xcite this takes place after the semiclassical time @xmath56 as a result of the mapping of the underlying momentum distribution to the density profile expected asymptotically . for our parameters @xmath57 , hence , @xmath58 ms and @xmath59 ms . fig .",
    "[ fig : curst ] shows probability current density as a function of time at observation point @xmath60 m outside the box after removal of the walls for various stationary states . from eq.([eq : wf_n ] ) it is obvious that @xmath32 remains a node of the wavefunction for even @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath61 for even @xmath31 .",
    "so because of a well - known property of bohmian paths , bohmian particle can not be initially located at @xmath32 or even pass through this point for even values of @xmath31 . as mentioned above ,",
    "right after eq .",
    "( [ eq : wf_der ] ) , for odd @xmath31 distance - derivative of the wavefunction is zero at point @xmath32 .",
    "thus , current probability density and consequently bohmian velocity is zero in this point all the time .",
    "therefore , a bohmian particle which is initially at @xmath62 , will remain at rest .",
    "because of noncrossing property of bohmian path , particles with @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) will go backwards ( forwards ) .",
    "[ fig : bopa7_500 ] .",
    "we have used runge - kutta method for the simultaneous integration of the time - dependent schdinger equation and the guidance law to compute bohmian trajectories .",
    "for @xmath65 , after @xmath66 ms trajectories exhibit a bifurcation into two main branches while for @xmath67 this takes place after @xmath68 ms .",
    "these values coincide very well with @xmath69 and @xmath70 in the above .",
    "[ fig : mearst ] shows the mean arrival time , in the context of bohmian mechanics , as a function of quantum number @xmath31 at the observation point @xmath60 m .",
    "it is clear that @xmath71 decreases with @xmath31 as one expects , because by growing @xmath31 , semiclassical velocity increases .    in the case of a gaussian packet ,",
    "parameters of the packet are chosen as @xmath72 m and @xmath73 m .",
    "it should be noted that with these parameters , initial gaussian packet is not normalized to unity but to @xmath74 ( truncated gaussian packet ) . if some one choses initial packet narrower than us , in such a way that it locates totally inside the well , then after removing the walls its evolution will be the same as a free gaussian packet which is not desired here . to show the differences we consider a free gaussian packet with the same parameters as well .",
    "[ fig : dencurgadivati ] shows the probability density versus distance , @xmath75 ms after removal of the walls and the probability current density at observation point @xmath60 m as a function of time for a free and a confined truncated gaussian packet . in the confined case",
    "one sees some oscillations in the plot of current density which are absent in the free case .",
    "finally , fig [ fig : bopaga ] shows a selection of bohmian paths for both cases . in the free case trajectories",
    "are determined by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the initial position of the particle@xcite . from the figure it follows that the trajectory which starts at @xmath78 is the bifurcation trajectory in both cases and bohmian velocity of a path in confined case is larger than the bohmian velocity of the corresponding path in the free case .",
    "the dynamics of particles , with various initial wavefunction , released from a box has been studied .",
    "different boundary conditions , the absorbing wall and the reflecting one , is considered .",
    "such studies suggest that the time - varying boundary conditions can give rise to interesting action - at - a - distance effects in quantum mechanics .",
    "quantum temporal oscillations of matter waves released from a confinement region constitute the hallmark of the diffraction in time effect .",
    "mean arrival time at a observation point outside the box has been considered for various initial states . moreover ,",
    "bohmian paths of the particle are computed .",
    "our calculated mean arrival time may have no relevance to the experiment . within bohm s causal theory of quantum mechanics",
    "if we try to measure properties other than _ position _ ( the only intrinsic property ) , we find that the result is affected by the process of interaction in a way that depends , not only on the total wave function , but also on the details of the initial conditions of both the particle and the apparatus .",
    "our calculations can be verified if mean arrival times can be experimentally measured in such a way that the experiment does not perturb the unmeasured quantity .",
