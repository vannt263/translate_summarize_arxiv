    "the frequency and properties of multiple star systems are important diagnostics for placing constraints on star formation processes and calibrating stellar evolutionary models .",
    "this has prompted numerous attempts to characterize the properties of nearby binary systems in the field .",
    "multiplicity surveys of solar - type stars ( e.g. abt & levy 1976 ; duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) found relatively high binary frequencies ( @xmath560% ) and a wide range of binary separations ( @xmath6@xmath7 au ) and mass ratios ( 1 to @xmath60.1 ) .",
    "this has led to the common assumption that binary systems are the primary channel for star formation .",
    "however , multiplicity surveys of lower - mass m dwarfs ( fischer & marcy 1992 ; reid & gizis 1997 ) observed marginally lower binary frequencies ( 35 - 43% ) and surveys near and below the substellar boundary ( close et al .",
    "2003 ; bouy et al .",
    "2003 ; burgasser et al . 2003 ; siegler et al .",
    "2005 ) found substantially lower binary frequencies ( 10 - 20% ) and separations ( typically @xmath620 au ) and a strong tendency toward mass ratios near unity .",
    "these results demonstrate that field binary properties depend on mass .",
    "unfortunately , binary properties for field stars are reported only for broad mass ranges , so they do not place strong constraints on the functional form of this dependence .",
    "various groups interpret the transition in binary properties as either a sharp break near the stellar / substellar boundary ( kroupa et al .",
    "2003 ; close et al . 2003 ) or a smooth mass dependence ( luhman et al .",
    "also , field multiplicity surveys can not constrain the mass dependence of substellar binary properties due to the degeneracy between brown dwarf masses and ages .",
    "substellar companions in the field also tend to be old and intrinsically faint , so a limited range of binary mass ratios are accessible to observations .",
    "finally , the field represents a composite population drawn from all star - formation regions , so field surveys can not probe the dependence of binary properties on initial conditions ( the stellar density , total mass , or mean jeans mass of the formation region ) .",
    "one solution to these problems is to extend multiplicity surveys to the nearest young uniform stellar populations : ob associations , t associations , and open clusters .",
    "multiplicity surveys have been conducted for many of the bright members of nearby open clusters and associations over the past decade using hst ( martin et al .",
    "2000 ; luhman et al .",
    "2005 ) , adaptive optics ( patience et al .",
    "2002 ; bouy et al .",
    "2006b ) , and speckle interferometry ( kohler et al .",
    "2000 ; white et al . 2006 ) .",
    "these surveys have confirmed many trends observed in the field , such as the high binary frequency and separations of solar - type stars ( e.g. ghez et al . 1993 ; kohler et al .",
    "2000 ) and the low frequency and separation of the lowest - mass systems ( martin et al . 2003 ; luhman et al . 2005 ; kraus et al . 2005 , 2006 ; bouy et al . 2006a ) .",
    "however , they have also found some potentially interesting discrepancies .",
    "surveys of different regions have revealed a mass dependence in binary frequency that is either smooth ( taurus - auriga ; white et al .",
    "2006 ) or potentially discontinuous near the substellar boundary ( upper scorpius ; kohler et al .",
    "2000 ; kraus et al .",
    "several systems with unusually wide separations or low mass ratios have also been found ( e.g. luhman et al .",
    "2004b ; bouy et al .",
    "2006b ) .",
    "high - resolution imaging techniques are typically resource - intensive , so it is expensive to undertake large programs which can sample a wide range of mass with sufficient statistical significance to characterize these effects .",
    "however , wide binary systems in the nearest associations have angular separations large enough to resolve without these techniques . a program which exploits a uniform",
    ", high - quality seeing - limited survey could substantially enhance our understanding of the role of mass and environment in binary properties .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results from a search for new young binary systems in the two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) , an all - sky imaging survey conducted in the near - infrared . in section 2 , we describe the selection of our survey sample , and we describe our data processing techniques in section 3 . we summarize the results of our search in section 4 .",
    "finally , in section 5 we compare these results to the standard paradigm of stellar multiplicity and discuss the implications for the processes of multiple star formation .",
    "in table 1 , we describe the young associations from which we have drawn our sample : taurus - auriga , chamaeleon i , and the two proposed subgroups of upper scorpius .",
    "the sample regions have been selected to include all large stellar populations ( @xmath5100 known members ) which are not heavily embedded , are located at distances of @xmath6200 pc , and have ages @xmath630 myr .",
    "these criteria neglect small associations and moving groups which can not contribute significant statistics ( tw hya , mbm 12 , chamaeleon ii , @xmath8 and @xmath9 cham , and the lupus clouds ) , distant populations for which seeing - limited observations on a small telescope can not probe sufficiently small separations ( ic 348 and the subgroups of orion ) , embedded populations like the @xmath4 oph complex , and old populations in which the wide binary population may have been shaped by dynamical evolution ( praesepe , pleiades , @xmath10 persei ) .    in table 2",
    ", we list the association members which we have adopted as our primary sample in the multiplicity search .",
    "the regional membership of our sample has been confirmed via low - resolution spectroscopy to verify signatures of youth , so contamination of the primary sample should be negligible .",
    "as we discuss in section 4.2 , the surveys from which we draw our sample are likely to be incomplete due to selection biases ; many of the new candidate companions found here would have been identified in previous surveys if they were complete and unbiased .",
    "this could potentially cause us to overestimate the wide binary frequency .",
    "wide binaries would only be excluded from our sample if both components were absent from previous membership surveys , so they are less likely to have been omitted from our sample than single members . however , this effect would have been more prevalent among faint low - mass systems ( where incompleteness is higher ) .",
    "we are testing for a decline in the binary frequency with mass , and any detection of this trend would be robust against this bias .",
    "saturation occurs for 2mass sources brighter than @xmath118 , but the images can still be used for sources as bright as @xmath116 ; we have neglected only the high - mass association members which are brighter than this limit , corresponding to spectral types earlier than g0 .",
    "these bright stars typically have been studied with adaptive optics ( e.g. kouwenhoven et al .",
    "2005 for the sco - cen complex ) , so analysis of 2mass data would not contribute significant new results .",
    "we also omit all sources which do not have confirmed spectral types since we can not estimate their mass .",
    "this criterion should eliminate most of the sources which are embedded in massive envelopes and surrounded by resolved nebulosity . finally , four of our primary sample members are fainter than our detection limit for binary companions ( @xmath12 ) , but we retain them in our sample in case they are binary companions to higher - mass association members which have not yet been identified .    in the following subsections ,",

    "this suggests that wide neighbors to our sample members should be identified in the psc , but most close neighbors are probably absent .",
    "we address this incompleteness by working directly with the processed survey images to identify close ( @xmath65 ) companions via psf - fitting photometry . from the 2mass website , we extracted postage - stamp ( 60x60@xmath26 ) and wide - field ( 510x1024@xmath26 ) images for each of the association members described in section 2 .",
    "the wide - field images were used to create reference psfs for each science target , while the postage - stamp images have been used to identify close visual companions .",
    "the width of the wide - field images ( 510@xmath26 ) corresponds to the width of each 2mass survey tile ; any image with larger width would include data taken at different epochs , and therefore with different seeing conditions .",
    "the height was chosen to allow for @xmath510 psf reference stars brighter than @xmath1111 in all fields .",
    "the size of the overlap region between adjacent tiles was 60 in right ascension and 8.5 in declination , so each science target appeared to be @xmath2830 away from the edge in at least one tile .",
    "the 2mass survey images were produced by coadding multiple exposures taken in sequence , each offset by @xmath185 in declination , so drawing psf reference stars from several arcminutes away could lead to nonuniform images .",
    "only sources @xmath640@xmath26 north or south of a science target were observed in all six exposures that the science target was observed , and sources @xmath5500@xmath26 north or south do not share any simultaneous scans .",
    "however , all of the scans which contribute to a wide - field image were observed within @xmath130 seconds .",
    "we do not expect the seeing - based psf to change on this short timescale , and we have found that the psf is usually constant over each entire wide - field image ( @xmath19@xmath29@xmath10.1@xmath26 ) .",
    "we identified candidate companions and measured their fluxes from the postage - stamp image of each sample member using the iraf package daophot ( stetson 1987 ) , specifically with the psf - fitting photometry routine allstar .",
    "the template psfs for each postage - stamp image were created using the pstselect and psf tasks .",
    "we selected template stars for each source from the corresponding wide - field image ; each psf was based on the eight brightest , unsaturated stars which appeared to be isolated under visual inspection .",
    "the appropriate photometric zero - point was extracted from the image headers .",
    "we compared psf - fitting magnitudes for single stars to the corresponding psc values in order to test our results ; there is no systematic offset , and the standard deviation of the random scatter in @xmath30 is @xmath10.03 magnitudes .    as we have discussed in previous publications ( kraus et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) , one limitation of allstar - based psf photometry is that binaries with very close ( @xmath6@xmath31@xmath29 ) separations are often not identified , even when their combined psf deviates significantly from that of a true point source .",
    "this limitation can be overcome for known or suspected binaries by manually adding a second point source in approximately the correct location and letting allstar recenter it to optimize the fit .",
    "however , this method requires objective criteria for identifying suspected binaries ; subjective selection methods like visual inspection would not allow us to rigorously choose and characterize a statistically complete sample .",
    "we have found that allstar s @xmath32@xmath33 statistic , which reports the goodness - of - fit between a source and the template psf , is an excellent diagnostic for this purpose .",

    "we list the value of @xmath32@xmath34 for each association member in table 2 .    in figure 1 , we plot the values of @xmath32@xmath34 as a function of k - band magnitude for a subset of sample members with no known companions between 0.5@xmath26 and 15@xmath26 ( according to the surveys of leinert et al .",

    "the goodness of fit degrades rapidly for saturated stars ( @xmath35 ) , so our technique does not discriminate betweeen single stars and candidate binaries in this regime .",
    "however , since there are few stars brighter than the saturation limit , we decided not to reject them until we were certain we could not identify any binary systems via other methods .",
    "the distribution of @xmath32@xmath34 values for unambiguously unsaturated stars ( @xmath36 ) is not normally distributed , but 95% of these stars produce fits with @xmath32@xmath34@xmath152.5 , so we have selected all sources with @xmath32@xmath34@xmath372.5 as candidate binary systems .",
    "the mean value of @xmath32@xmath34 for single stars should be @xmath13 since it represents the sum of 3 variables which follow a @xmath32@xmath33 distribution .",
    "however , we find that the mean value reported by allstar for unsaturated single sources is @xmath11.75 .",
    "this disagreement is caused by an overestimate of the photometric errors in each observation by allstar .",
    "the coadding and subsampling process used in the 2mass image processing pipeline results in correlated noise between adjacent pixels of the final survey images , so the true uncertainties are lower than those estimated solely by poisson statistics ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we identified the candidate binaries in our sample based on this empirically motivated @xmath32@xmath34 selection criterion , and then we attempted to fit each with a pair of point sources separated initially by the psf fwhm ( 3@xmath26 ) and with position angle corresponding to the angle of maximum elongation of the system psf .",
    "the allstar routine optimized the components separation , position angle , and magnitudes to produce the optimal fit ; as we further summarize in section 3.3 , known binaries were typically fit with consistent positions and flux ratios in all three bandpasses while contaminants ( such as sources with an erroneous template psf in one filter ) did not produce consistent fits in multiple images .",
    "we adopt the criterion that any candidate binary with component positions within 1@xmath26 ( 3@xmath19 for astrometry of very close , faint companions ; section 3.4 ) in all three filters is a bona - fide visual binary .",
    "we found that saturated stars produced fits for erroneous companions at separations of 1.0 - 1.5 , so we have rejected all candidate companions to saturated targets ( @xmath38 ) with separations of @xmath152 . known binaries with wider separations produced consistent fits even in the saturated regime for systems fainter than @xmath39 , so we adopted this as a maximum brightness limit for our sample .    finally , we compared the location of each candidate companion with the online catalog of 2mass image artifacts .",
    "we found that a candidate companion to mho - tau-4 was coincident with a persistence artifact flag .",
    "furthermore , a previous high - resolution imaging survey with hst ( kraus et al . 2006 ) found no optical counterpart to a limit of @xmath40@xmath124 , so we removed this candidate companion from further consideration and treat mho - tau-4 as a single star .",
    "we determined companion detection limits as a function of distance from the primary stars via a monte carlo simulation similar to that of metchev et al .",
    "we used the iraf task daophot / addstar to add artificial stars at a range of radial separations and magnitudes to the images of fo tau , mho - tau-5 , kpno - tau-8 , and kpno - tau-9 .",
    "these four sources have been shown to be single to the limits of high - resolution imaging ( ghez et al .",
    "1993 ; kraus et al . 2006 ) and span the full range of brightness in this sample .",
    "we then attempted to identify the artificial companions via psf - fitting photometry .",
    "our photometric routines attempt simultaneous source identification in all three filters in order to separate erroneous detections from genuine companions , so we created the same synthetic source in all three filters using colors from the 2 myr baraffe isochrones ( baraffe et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in figure 2",
    ", we show our survey s 50% detection limits as a function of separation for identifying candidate companions using the same psf - fitting algorithm as our actual search program .",
    "the minimum separation at which we can detect equal - flux companions is @xmath11 for bright , unsaturated sources and @xmath11.6 for sources just above our adopted @xmath41 band magnitude limit ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the 10% and 90% detection limits are typically @xmath10.5 magnitudes below and above the 50% limit .",
    "the sensitivity of psf - fitting photometry falls at separations @xmath55 since objects become cleanly resolved and most companion flux falls outside the fitting radius for the primary .",
    "however , the psc is complete to at least @xmath12 at larger separations , so wider companions will be recovered by our search of the catalog .",
    "we also show the separation and flux ratio for known binary systems which have been detected in k - band surveys ( kohler et al . 2000 ; white et al .",
    "2006 ) and whether these systems were unambiguously recovered ( via either psf - fitting photometry or the psc ) , identified as candidate systems based on the @xmath32@xmath34 criterion , or not recovered .",
    "the limits between detected and nondetected systems are roughly consistent with our empirically determined magnitude limits , but there are few known systems which fall near these limits .",
    "there are only two known wide systems among the faintest members of our sample ( @xmath42 ) , so we can not significantly test the detection limits of our search method in this brightness range .",
    "however , we identified four additional candidate companions to sources in this brightness range , plus numerous likely background stars , so our survey appears to be sensitive to companions in this regime .",
    "many of our candidate binaries have separations of @xmath6@xmath31@xmath29 , so our measurements could be subject to significant uncertainties .",
    "we tested these uncertainties by using a monte carlo routine to produce synthetic images for binaries spanning a range of primary brightnesses , flux ratios , and separations .",
    "specifically , we used addstar to construct simulated @xmath0 images , and then we measured the binary fluxes and separations for each set of simulated images using allstar . for each combination of parameters",
    ", we produced 100 sets of synthetic images with randomly distributed position angles .",
    "the @xmath43 and @xmath44 colors for the secondaries were drawn from the 2 myr isochrone of baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in order to determine realistic values for @xmath45@xmath41 , @xmath45@xmath17 , and @xmath45@xmath16 .    in figure 3 , we show the standard deviation in the measured brightness for our simulated binary companions as a function of separation .",
    "these simulations predict that photometric uncertainties increase significantly at separations of @xmath63 , so measured colors may not be reliable at small separations . as we describe in section 3.5",
    ", these colors are necessary at large separations ( @xmath285 ) to distinguish candidate companions from background stars",
    ". however , contamination from background sources should be low at small separations ( @xmath63 ) due to their low surface density , so we can neglect these selection criteria with only a minor increase in the number of erroneous binary identifications .    in figure 4",
    ", we show a similar plot of the rms scatter in the measured position of the secondary .",
    "the typical standard deviations are @xmath60.3 for all but the faintest companions ,",
    "so the uncertainties in our measured separations should have similar precision .",
    "given these positional uncertainties , the corresponding uncertainties in position angles range from 1 to 10 degrees , depending on the binary separation .",
    "the standard deviations in secondary position for our simulated images are consistent with the scatter between the three filters for each observed binary , so we adopt the results from these simulations as our estimated uncertainties .",
    "we also conducted monte carlo tests to determine the probability of mistakenly identifying a true single star as a binary .",
    "we constructed a series of simulated images ( 100 each for four objects spanning our sample s range of brightness ) , and then tried to fit each object with two point sources .",
    "we found that this never produced consistent fits in 3 filters , though faint peaks due to noise were occasionally identified in one of the 3 images .",
    "this suggest that the probability of an erroneous binary identification due to statistical errors is low ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "this agrees with our results for known single stars ; as we note in section 3.2 , 5% of known single stars fall above our @xmath32@xmath34 criterion for identifying candidate binaries . however , none of these yielded fits for multiple point sources in all 3 filters .",
    "the identification of binary companions based solely on proximity is complicated by contamination from foreground dwarfs , background giants , and reddened early - type background dwarfs .",
    "we have not conducted followup spectroscopic or astrometric observations to confirm association membership , so we must limit the survey to a total area in which the contamination from background stars is small compared to the number of candidate binary companions .",
    "we estimate the surface density of contaminants for each association based on the total number of objects within an annulus of 30 - 90 from all of the association members in our sample .",
    "field surveys ( e.g. duquennoy & mayor 1991 ; reid & gizis 1997 ) have identified few binaries with projected separations of @xmath5500 au ( @xmath530at the distance of our sample members ) , so this method will also address the probability of chance alignment with other association members .",
    "our estimate of the contamination could be influenced by variations in background source counts due to the large angular extent of these associations or by variations in galactic latitude or extinction .",
    "the result would be a systematic overestimation of the association probability for candidate companions at points of high contamination and a corresponding underestimation at points of low contamination .",
    "however , any local deviation from the mean contamination rate should not affect the binary statistics for the association as a whole since the ensemble background at 30 - 90 will match the ensemble background at @xmath1530 .",
    "our subsequent cuts against color , mass ratio , and separation will also help to homogenize the sample by preferentially removing background stars .",
    "most previous multiplicity surveys were based on observations in a single optical or near - infrared bandpass ( e.g. kohler et al .",
    "2000 ) ; in the absence of color information , these surveys can only estimate physical association probabilities for candidate companions based on the surface density of background stars of similar brightness .",
    "since 2mass includes images in 3 filters , we can reject most background stars by requiring colors consistent with regional membership ( section 4.1 ) .",
    "specifically , we have plotted ( @xmath47 ) and ( @xmath48 ) color - magnitude diagrams for each region and we require prospective binary companions to fall above a smoothed field main sequence ( bessell & brett 1988 ; leggett et al .",
    "2001 ) for the regional distance in both cmds .",
    "we have chosen to use @xmath41 as a proxy for luminosity instead of @xmath16 in order to minimize the effect of extinction for background stars .",
    "this choice will cause disk - bearing association members to sit preferentially higher in our color - magnitude diagrams , but this moves them further from our selection cutoff , so our results should be robust .    as a test of these color criteria",
    ", we have plotted color - magnitude diagrams for the members of our primary sample .",
    "we find that @xmath197% of the primaries have colors consistent with our definition of association membership , so any incompleteness in the selection of binary companions should be negligible .",
    "most unselected primaries fall just below our color cuts ; the only sample members which fall well below the association sequences are gsc 06191 - 00552 and usco-160803.6 - 181237 .",
    "both of these objects are claimed to be spectroscopically - confirmed members of usco - a , but the spectra are not available in the literature .",
    "we have not detected any binary companions to these objects , so their erroneous inclusion in our sample would not significantly change our results .",

    "burgasser et al . demonstrated , using the formalism of weinberg et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , that this is not due to interactions with field stars or giant molecular clouds , but instead must be a feature of the formation process or a result of early dynamical evolution in the formation environment .",
    "these empirical relations predict maximum separations of 330 au and 1650 au for total system masses of @xmath10.4 and 0.6 @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "this prediction is consistent with the general minimum primary mass of @xmath10.25 @xmath3 that we have identified among the wide binaries in our sample .",
    "the implication is that this limit is indeed set by the t tauri stage , either as a result of the formation process or during dynamical evolution while these systems are still embedded in their natal gas cloud .",
    "however , we have identified one candidate system , usco-160611.9 - 193532 , with an apparent low - mass primary ( 0.13 @xmath3 ; spt m5 ) and a very wide projected separation ( 10.8 ; 1550 au ) .",
    "the usno - b proper motion for the secondary ( @xmath67,@xmath68=-8,-18 mas yr@xmath25 ) suggests that it is a genuine usco member and not a background star . as we will report in a future publication ,",
    "subsequent observations with laser guide star adaptive optics on the keck - ii telescope also find that the primary is itself a close ( @xmath10.1 ) equal - flux pair .",
    "if the wide visual companion is gravitationally bound , then this triple system ( @xmath690.4 @xmath3 ) does not follow the empirical mass - maximum separation relations .",
    "there are several other candidate wide binary systems which could potentially violate these relations , but the probability of background star contamination is high enough in these cases that association membership should be confirmed via spectroscopy before any conclusions are drawn .    finally , a census of several star - forming regions by simon ( 1997 ) found that pre - main sequence stars tend to cluster on two length scales , with two - point correlation functions described by separate power laws .",
    "he concluded that small - scale clustering is a result of binary formation , while clustering on larger scales is a result of the condensation of multiple cores from single molecular clouds .",
    "this could potentially explain the excess of wide companions in taurus , where the stars are younger and have not dispersed as far from their formation point .",
    "however , simon found that the transition occurred at separations of @xmath1@xmath7 au in taurus , and our survey truncates at @xmath11500 au .",
    "this suggests that unless his initial estimate was significantly higher than the true transition point , all of our candidate companions fall within the binary regime .",
    "field multiplicity surveys have found that the mass ratio distribution varies significantly with primary star mass .",
    "most solar - mass primaries possess binary companions with low mass ratios ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) , early m dwarf primaries possess companions with a uniform mass ratio distribution ( fischer & marcy 1992 ) , and late - m dwarf and brown dwarf primaries possess companions with mass ratios near unity ( e.g. close et al .",
    "2003 ; siegler et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "our results can not support any strong statistical claims , but they are largely consistent with this pattern .",
    "the only exception is that our results for the highest - mass stars ( 1.16 - 2.50 @xmath3 ) suggest the presence of a possible excess of wide similar - mass binaries .",
    "the excess is not consistent with background star contamination since the primaries are all very bright and most background stars should be significantly fainter ; many of these binary companions have been confirmed independently as association members .",
    "it is also unlikely that we missed a significant number of companions with @xmath70 ; the detection limits ( in @xmath45@xmath41 or @xmath52 ) are best for bright stars and significantly exceed the limits of our statistically complete sample .",
    "this mass ratio distribution is also discrepant with that found by kouwenhoven et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for b - a stars in sco - cen ; they found a distribution which is very similar to that of duquennoy & mayor , with a strong deficit of equal - mass binaries compared to unequal - mass binaries .",
    "this discrepancy could represent another environmental dependence in multiple star formation .",
    "most of our high - mass binaries are found in the dark - cloud complexes , while the kouwenhoven sample was drawn from the three ob associations of sco - cen .",
    "the field sample of duquennoy & mayor is probably also dominated by stars from dissolved ob associations or open clusters since those are thought to be the dominant star formation channel in our galaxy . since the binary frequency and binary separations appear to be affected by environmental conditions , it is plausible that the mass ratio distribution could also be affected .      recent efforts to model binary formation have typically assumed that a cluster of 5 - 10 protostellar embryos form from a single fragmenting cloud core ( e.g. kroupa 1995 ; sterzik & durisen 1998 ; kroupa & bouvier 2003 ; kroupa et al .",
    "2003 ; delgado - donate et al .",
    "2003 ; hubber & whitworth 2005 ) ; these embryos would then undergo accretion and dynamical evolution to form single stars and stable multiple systems .",
    "this scenario would provide a convenient explanation for variations in binary properties between unbound associations or bound clusters since the stellar encounter rate would vary with stellar density .",
    "however , the frequency of multiple stellar systems has been interpreted by goodwin & kroupa ( 2005 ) to mean that the collapse and fragmentation of a cloud core produces only 2 or 3 stars , not 5 - 10 .",
    "larger systems would eject more single stars and tight binaries than are observed .",
    "most models also predict that dynamical evolution would alter other stellar properties ( spatial and velocity dispersion , disk lifetime , and accretion frequency ) , particularly at low masses .",
    "the preponderance of observational evidence shows that these properties are not consistent with strong dynamical evolution and do not vary significantly with mass ( white & basri 2003 ; luhman 2004d ; white & hillenbrand 2004 ; mohanty et al .",
    "however , some updated models of dynamical evolution suggest that not all of these features would show strong signatures ( e.g. bate & bonnell 2005 ) .",
    "the apparently minor role of dynamical processes suggests that binary properties might be established during the fragmentation of a cloud core , rather than in subsequent dynamical evolution .",
    "sterzik et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggested that the initial cloud temperature could play a role in determining the frequency of wide binary systems .",
    "they noted that the radius of a cloud core at the end of isothermal collapse is inversely related to the initial cloud temperature .",
    "this suggests that regions of low temperature will have larger spatial scales during fragmentation , and therefore a wider distribution of binary separations",
    ". this could be due either to a higher primordial cloud temperature or due to heating from other young stars .",
    "we have found that the wide binary frequency in usco - a is comparable to that of open clusters like praesepe or the pleiades ( patience et al .",
    "2002 ) or young clusters like ic-348 and the onc ( luhman et al . 2005 ; kohler et al .",
    "the stellar density is much lower in ob associations like usco - a , so the similarity between their binary populations suggests that another initial condition might play a key role in determining the binary separation distribution ( and thus the frequency of wide binary systems ) .",
    "kohler et al . also found that binary properties do not differ significantly between the core and the periphery of the onc , which span a significant range of stellar densities .",
    "these trends imply that wide binaries only form in the absence of high - mass stars , or equivalently that the presence of high - mass stars suppress wide binary formation .",
    "the argument by sterzik et al .",
    "could provide a natural explanation for this trend ; high - mass stars irradiate surrounding cloud cores , and the subsequent increase in temperature would decrease the final length scale over which fragmentation would occur .",
    "we present the results of a search for wide binary systems among 783 members of three nearby young associations : taurus - auriga , chamaeleon i , and the two subgroups of upper scorpius .",
    "this program analyzed near - infrared @xmath0 imagery from the two - micron all - sky survey to search for wide ( 1 - 30 ; @xmath1150 - 4500 au ) companions to known association members , using color - magnitude cuts to reject likely background stars .",
    "we identified a total of 131 candidate binary companions in these associations , of which 39 have not been previously identified in the literature .",
    "we find that the wide binary frequency ( 330 - 1650 au ; @xmath57 ) is a function of both mass and environment , with significantly higher frequencies among high - mass stars than lower - mass stars and in the t associations than in the ob association .",
    "we discuss the implications for wide binary formation and conclude that the environmental dependence is not a direct result of stellar density or total association mass , but instead might depend on another parameter like the gas temperature of the formation environment .",
    "we also analyze the mass ratio distribution as a function of mass and find that it largely agrees with the distribution seen for field stars .",
    "there appears to be a moderate excess of similar - mass ( @xmath71 ) wide binaries among the highest - mass ( 1.16 - 2.50 @xmath3 ) stars in our sample , but the number statistics do not support any other strong conclusions .",
    "the binary populations in these associations generally follow the empirical mass - maximum separation relation observed for field binaries , but we have found one candidate low - mass system ( usco-160611.9 - 193532 ; @xmath2@xmath10.4 @xmath3 ) which has a projected separation ( 10.8 ; 1550 au ) much larger than the limit for its mass .    finally , we find that the binary frequency in the usco - b subgroup is significantly higher than the usco - a subgroup and is consistent with the measured values in taurus and cham i. this discrepancy , the absence of high - mass stars in usco - b , and its marginally distinct kinematics suggest that it might not be directly associated with either usco - a or upper centaurus - lupus , but instead represent an older analogue of the @xmath4 oph or lupus associations .",
    "the authors thank r. white and c. slesnick for helpful feedback on the manuscript and on various ideas presented within .",
    "this work makes use of data products from the two micron all - sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",
    "this research has also made extensive use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france , and of the usnofs image and catalogue archive operated by the united states naval observatory , flagstaff station ( http://www.nofs.navy.mil/data/fchpix/ ) .",
    "photometric criteria are usually insufficient for identifying members of stellar populations . as we show in section 3 , near -",
    "infrared color cuts allow us to reject only @xmath150 - 90% of background and foreground contaminants .",
    "any further increase in the rejection rate of our survey would require either spectroscopic observations ( to test for lithium or signatures of low surface gravity , both indicators of youth ) or astrometric observations ( to measure proper motions and test for kinematic association ) .",
    "performing spectroscopic observations can be a resource - intensive undertaking , but astrometric data are now commonly available from all - sky surveys .",
    "the largest astrometric database currently available is the usno - b catalogue ( monet et al .",
    "2003 ) , which computed proper motions from the palomar observatory sky surveys of the mid-1950s and early 1980s .",
    "these observations were originally performed using wide - field photographic plates , and the usno team digitally scanned these plates and computed photometry and astrometry for every source .",
    "the faint limit for photometry is @xmath1@xmath72 , and astrometry is available for most sources brighter than @xmath73 .",
    "typical proper motion uncertainties are @xmath12 - 3 mas yr@xmath25 in each axis for bright stars and @xmath610 - 15 mas yr@xmath25 for faint stars .    since the usno - b catalogue is the result of an automated photometric / astrometric pipeline , individual measurements are subject to some uncertainties like distortions in the plate scale and centroid errors due to diffraction spikes from nearby bright stars .",
    "there are also some design issues which limit its utility .",
    "for example , objects with no proper motion information ( such as from detection in only one epoch ) are reported to have proper motions of 0 mas yr@xmath25 , but all objects which have motions within 1@xmath19 of zero are also rounded to 0 mas yr@xmath25 .",
    "thus , it is impossible to determine whether a measurement of 0 mas yr@xmath25 corresponds to a bad measurement or a genuine detection of small proper motion",
    ". finally , most stars within @xmath1510 of a brighter object do not have proper motion measurements available , so usno - b astrometry is only potentially useful in studying wide companions .    in figure 8 , we present a plot of the fraction of confirmed upper sco members as a function of magnitude which possess any usno - b proper motion measurement ( dashed line ) and a measurement which lies within 15 mas yr@xmath25 of the mean association value ( @xmath13@xmath19 for bright sources ; solid line ) .",
    "the maximum fraction of confirmed members which are identified as kinematic members is only @xmath12/3 , and this fraction declines rapidly for faint targets ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "this suggests that using existing proper motions to select candidate binary companions would introduce significant incompleteness in the resulting statistics , so we have chosen to omit this data from our selection criteria .",
    "however , these proper motion measurements are useful as a test of our selection process , so we list the usno - b proper motions for each candidate companion in table 5",
    ". those objects with consistent proper motions could be high - priority candidates for spectroscopic followup or more detailed astrometric followup .",
    "we also list the proper motions of each primary star in our sample in table 2 .",
    "the young stars of the sco - cen complex are divided into three subgroups : upper scorpius , upper centaurus - lupus , and lower - centaurus crux .",
    "these three subgroups are spatially distinct on the sky , but there is some overlap along the border between populations .",
    "this can lead to ambiguities in assigning stars to their appropriate population .",
    "for example , the stars of usco - b lie on the border between upper scorpius and upper - centaurus lupus .",
    "it is not known which group they are associated with , or if they form another distinct population . the color - magnitude sequences for each subgroup are not distinct due to their similar age and distance , so photometry does not provide a reliable diagnostic of subgroup membership .",
    "however , studies of the high - mass stars of sco - cen ( e.g. de zeeuw et al . 1999 ) have found that the space velocities of each subgroup differ by a few km s@xmath25 . this difference is not measurable in the proper motions of individual stars , but it might be detected as a difference in the mean proper motion for a population .    in figure 9 , we present proper motion diagrams for usco members which have previously been assigned to usco - a or usco - b by brandner et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and kohler et al .",
    "the mean proper motions for each subgroup are not directly comparable due to projection effects , but given the small radial velocity of usco - a ( -4.6 km s@xmath25 ; de zeeuw et al .",
    "1999 ) and the locations of the association centers ( 16h , -22@xmath75 for usco - a ; 15.5h , -31@xmath75 for usco - b ) , the difference in proper motions should be no more than 2 - 3 mas yr@xmath25 and the vectors should be almost parallel .",
    "we find that the proper motion of usco - b ( 33.2 mas yr@xmath25 ) is significantly higher than that of usco - a ( 22.3 mas yr@xmath25 ) , and the vectors diverge by @xmath115 degrees .",
    "this result suggests not only that it is appropriate to consider usco - a and usco - b separately for statistical purposes , but that it might be prudent to question the relationship between usco - b and the rest of sco - cen . the difference in space velocities between usco - b and the other nearby sco - cen subgroups ( @xmath110 km s@xmath25 ) is far higher than that between the major subgroups .",
    "however , any further investigation is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we also conclude that the kinematic information lacks sufficient precision to distinguish the subgroup membership of individual stars and identify the boundary between the regions .",
    "indeed , it is likely that there is no precise dividing line .",
    "the spatial distribution of these objects on the celestial sphere is only a projection of their three - dimensional distribution , so it is quite likely that the projected two - dimensional distributions overlap .",
    "this suggests that any difference between these two populations could be averaged out by cross - contamination .",
    "however , the distinct proper motions apparent in figure 9 imply that most of the stars have been classified in the appropriate group .     which have been previously assigned to either usco - a or usco - b .",
    "the large filled circles denote the regional proper motions for upper sco ( -10,-25 ) and ucl ( -16,-27 ) as determined by hipparcos for early - type members ( de zeeuw et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the large open circles denote regional proper motions for usco - a ( -9.3,-20.2 ) and usco - b ( -21.3,-25.5 ) as determined from our data .",
    "the typical uncertainties for individual measurements are shown with error bars in the upper left corner ; the scatter for usco - a appears to be consistent with these uncertainties , but the scatter for usco - b is significantly larger . the uncertainties in the mean values are @xmath10.5 mas yr@xmath25 for usco - a and @xmath11.5 mas yr@xmath25 for usco - b . ]",
    "the distinct binary properties observed for usco - a and usco - b suggest that it might be prudent to reconsider the nature of usco - b .",
    "the sco - cen complex consists primarily of three kinematically associated ob associations : lower centaurus - crux , upper centaurus - lupus , and upper scorpius .",
    "the @xmath4 oph dark cloud complex is also associated with sco - cen ( specifically with usco ) , and the lupus dark clouds could be kinematically associated , but the evidence of is not yet conclusive .",
    "lcc and ucl appear to be @xmath15 - 10 myr older than usco , which in turn is @xmath15 myr older than @xmath4 oph .",
    "this has been cited as evidence ( e.g. mamajek et al .",
    "2002 ; sartori et al .",
    "2003 ) that triggered star formation is occurring in sco - cen .",
    "the implication is that supernovae originating from the highest - mass members of ucl triggered star formation in usco , and in turn one or more supernovae in usco triggered star formation in @xmath4 oph . since the ages of ucl and lcc are somewhat uncertain , it is unclear whether they are coeval or one triggered star formation in the other .",
    "usco - b is located on the border between ucl and usco , in a region largely bereft of high - mass stars .",
    "its age and distance are difficult to assess since there are no high - mass members which might possess hipparcos distances , but the association s color - magnitude sequences lie slightly lower than usco - a and are consistent with the slightly larger distance and older age of ucl .",
    "however , its kinematics ( appendix a ) appear to be marginally inconsistent with the ob subgroups of sco - cen , with a spatial velocity which differs by @xmath110 km s@xmath25 . finally , its binary properties are inconsistent with the one ob association which has been extensively studied ( usco - a )",
    "; no comparison is possible with ucl since there have been no large - scale surveys for new low - mass members .",
    "the absence of high - mass stars and high wide binary frequency in usco - b are much more consistent with low - density t associations .",
    "this suggests that perhaps usco - b is an older analogue to the @xmath4 oph or lupus clouds : an association consisting primarily of low - mass stars whose formation was triggered by supernovae in ucl , much as the current star formation in @xmath4 oph was triggered by supernovae in usco , but which is not directly associated .",
    "unfortunately , it will be difficult to test this assertion .",
    "any primordial gas in usco - b has been dispersed , either consumed in star formation or swept away by supernovae and stellar winds , so it only consists of an unbound association of pre - main - sequence stars .",
    "the low galactic latitude of usco - b also results in significant contamination from background stars , which will confuse any photometric surveys that attempt to identify these stellar members of the association .",

    "<S> we present the results of a search for wide binary systems among 783 members of three nearby young associations : taurus - auriga , chamaeleon i , and two subgroups of upper scorpius . </S>",
    "<S> near - infrared ( @xmath0 ) imagery from 2mass was analyzed to search for wide ( 1 - 30 ; @xmath1150 - 4500 au ) companions to known association members , using color - magnitude cuts to reject likely background stars . </S>",
    "<S> we identify a total of 131 candidate binary companions with colors consistent with physical association , of which 39 have not been identified previously in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the wide binary frequency is a function of both mass and environment , with significantly higher frequencies among high - mass stars than lower - mass stars and in the t associations than in the ob association . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications for wide binary formation and conclude that the environmental dependence is not a direct result of stellar density or total association mass , but instead might depend on another environmental parameter like the gas temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze the mass ratio distribution as a function of mass and find that it agrees with the distribution for field stars to within the statistical uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> the binary populations in these associations generally follow the empirical mass - maximum separation relation observed for field binaries , but we have found one candidate low - mass system ( usco-160611.9 - 193532 ; @xmath2@xmath10.4 @xmath3 ) which has a projected separation ( 10.8 ; 1550 au ) much larger than the suggested limit for its mass . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find that the binary frequency in the usco - b subgroup is significantly higher than in the usco - a subgroup and is consistent with the measured values in taurus and cham i. this discrepancy , the absence of high - mass stars in usco - b , and its marginally distinct kinematics suggest that it might not be directly associated with the ob associations of sco - cen , but instead represents an older analogue of the younger @xmath4 oph or lupus associations . </S>"
