    "nova outbursts are associated with close binary systems in which the secondary star fills its roche lobe and transfers gas onto the companion white dwarf via an accretion disk ( gehrz , 1988 ) .",
    "this hydrogen rich gas accumulates onto the surface of the white dwarf until temperatures and densities are high enough to ignite thermonuclear reactions .",
    "a thermonuclear runaway process takes place leading to the ejection of gas at hundreds or thousands of kilometers per second ( saizar et al .",
    "this expanding gas has a chemical composition which is more metal rich than solar , and later on is photoionized by the hot underlying white dwarf .",
    "the thermonuclear runaway model can account for some cno enhancement abundances observed in novae .",
    "some other heavy element abundances , however , as the ones measured in nova cygni  1992 ( austin et al .",
    "1996 ; hereafter a96 ) , can apparently only be explained by a mixing of the accreted envelope with white dwarf s core material ( starrfield et al .",
    "1986 and truran and livio 1986 ) .",
    "two types of nova are commonly recognized : co novae , in which the progenitor is a carbon - oxygen white dwarf , and onemg novae , involving an oxygen - neon- magnesium white dwarf .",
    "novae cygni 1992 belongs to this second type since the most prominent emission lines are [ ne  iii ] 3869/3967 , [ ne  v ] 3346/3426   and [ o  iii ] 4959/5007 ( matheson et al .",
    "1993 ) .    here",
    "we use spectroscopic observations taken over a 4 year period , coupled with photoionization models , in order to study the time evolution of the nebular line spectra of nova cygni 1992 from day 85 to day 1581 after the outburst .",
    "the models provide the white dwarf s temperature and the hydrogen density and chemical composition of the emitting shell under the simple approximations of uniform and spherically symmetric shell .",
    "the spectral line structure and hst images show a more complex morphology ( paresce et al .",
    "1995 ) , which suggests one must interpret these results with caution .",
    "the data were obtained primarily with the dominion astrophysical observatory 1.8-m plaskett telescope , but as the nova faded the kitt peak national observatory 2.1-m and the multi - mirror telescope were employed .",
    "the log of the observations is shown in table 1 .",
    "the nebular observations began on may 15 , 1992 ( 85 days after the outburst ) and continued until june 1996 ( 1581 days after maximum ) .",
    "the data are all long - slit spectra using a ccd as a detector .",
    "the spectral images were reduced using standard iraf packages to remove amplifer bias and flat field variations as well as to extract and calibrate the spectra .",
    "moderate resolution combined with good wavelength coverage was achieved by taking spectra of the nova and standard stars at a variety of grating tilts , taking care that consecutive spectra overlapped in wavelength .",
    "the spectra were then reduced individually and combined by scaling to match the overlap sections .    for the dao observations , the slit width was 1.5@xmath2 to 2@xmath2 and standard stars",
    "were observed near the same airmass as the nova , which reduces the effects of slit losses caused by differential refraction .",
    "the kpno and mmt spectra were taken at the parallactic angle .",
    "the major source of error in the observed line ratios comes from combining spectra taken with different grating tilts as this error can accumulate over a large span of wavelengths .",
    "we estimate that ratios of lines with small wavelength separations ( @xmath3100 nm ) are good to 10% while lines ratios spanning @xmath4300 nm are accurate to about 30% .",
    "the nebular emission lines of v1974  cyg were broad ( @xmath5 km / s fwhm ) with a symetric shape that persisted for the first two years after discovery .",
    "the evolution of the spectral line shape is best exemplified by [ o  iii ] 4959/5007 emission .",
    "figure  1 displays the [ o  iii ] line in 1992 .",
    "early on the lines were extremly broad , suggesting a fast wind dominated emission and smeared out the kinematic features .",
    "through out 1992 , the [ o  iii ] line narrows and the individual features become more clearly defined .",
    "figure  2 shows that between 1992 and 1995 the [ o  iii ] lines become even more narrow , and the symmetry dissolves into many knots as the emission becomes dominated by low density gas that is slow to recombine .",
    "the striking symmetry in the early spectral features suggests a simple geometrical structure of the ejecta and implies that the line profile can be modeled in a straightforward way by following the prescription developed by hutchings ( 1972 ) .",
    "the ejecta from novae in hutchings model consists of an expanding ring and polar caps , which inherently reflect the binary symmetry of the system .",
    "our basic kinematical model consists of a shell of emission expanding at a velocity of 1100@xmath6 .",
    "the emission is enhanced in the equatorial region and polar regions and the viewing angle is 35@xmath7 from the pole .",
    "figure  3 shows a comparison between a simple kinematical model and the observations of the [ o  iii ] 5007 line profile for three epochs in 1992 .",
    "this single - velocity equatorial ring / polar blob model reproduces the basic spectral features , except for the lowest velocity emission peak and the broad wings of the earliest data .",
    "figure  4 displays a projection onto the sky at the [ o  iii ] 5007 emission compared with an archival 1994 hst foc observation of cygni 1992 at the same wavelength range .",
    "the model image perhaps exaggerates the polar caps , but overall it resembles the observations .",
    "the parameters of the model , the same for the spectrum and image , are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the line profiles have also been modeled by austin ( 1995 ) and by hayward et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ( hereafter h96 ) , based on a more complete physical model .",
    "note that hydrodynamical simulations of nova shells by gill & obrien ( 1999 ) fail to reproduce the equatorial and polar features that appear to be common in nova shells .",
    "the emission line fluxes were modeled using the photoionization code cloudy , version 84.12a ( ferland 1993 ) .",
    "the code simultaneously solves the equations of thermal and statistical equilibrium for a spherical shell of a dilute gas which is being photoionized by an underlying thermal source .",
    "the input parameters for the code are the temperature and luminosity of the source ( assumed to be a blackbody ) and those describing the characteristics of the shell , i.e. the hydrogen density , radius , thickness and chemical composition .",
    "there is also the possibility to use other parameters to describe the covering and filling factors to account for the inhomogeneities of the ejecta , but since we were interested only in the fluxes relative to , these parameters were not changed in the models .",
    "the code then integrates the emission over this shell giving the emergent emission - line spectrum .",
    "the best fit parameters for cloudy are shown in table 3 ( temperature of the ionizing source and hydrogen density of the shell ) and table 4 ( chemical abundance of the shell ) .",
    "the intrinsic errors in the temperature and density determinations are estimated to be 15 and 20% respectively , but systematic errors are likely to dominate , due for example to the fact that we are assuming spherical symmetry , eventhough observations show this is not the case .",
    "figures 5 through 10 we present the comparison between the modeled synthetic spectra and the dereddened observations for days 85 , 140 , 172 , 202 , 250 , 401 , 506 , 565 , 639 , 1381 and 1581 after the outburst .",
    "the observations were dereddened with e(b - v)=0.32 ( chochol , d. et al .",
    "table 5 presents the dereddened observed fluxes of some selected lines compared to the model predictions .    in order to directly compare the model and the data ,",
    "the continuum was subtracted in all the observed spectra ( a technique particularly important for the 1381 and 1581 days ) , and an arbitrary constant was added to set a constant continuum levels .",
    "we created synthetic spectra from the model output using a gaussian function with a fixed fwhm of 30   to approximate the observed line widths .    in the figures comparing the models to the data ,",
    "the emission calculated from the photoionization models are identified in the upper row . only those lines with integrated flux @xmath8 relative to",
    "are shown . in those cases where the lines are too close together only the brightest line from the `` blend '' is labeled ( although all the lines are marked ) .",
    "the identification of the rest of the lines in a blend can be found in the figure captions . from the figures it is clear that the brightest lines change from one day to another as the physical conditions of the nebula evolve .",
    "the lower row labels mark the lines which are observed but not predicted by the models , this is either because they are not included in the code or because their integrated fluxes are lower than @xmath9 .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of the [ o  i ] 6300/63 lines , which are observed but for which the models predict even stronger lines of [ s  iii ] 6312  and fe x 6374 .",
    "the abundances of the elements were initially taken from a96 , and since no dust formation was reported in nova cygni 92 ( paresce et al . 1995 ; h96 ) , we do not expect a significant depletion of heavy elements ; we therefore assume that the mean chemical composition of the gas remains constant in time .",
    "we found that the initial values given by a96 overestimated the strength of the c ii 4267 , n ii 5680 , [ s  iii ] 6312 , ar iii 7135 , plus some of the fe and o lines .",
    "the gas abundances ( relative to hydrogen , with h = 1 for the solar value ) were then modified to improve the comparison with the observations as follows : s = 122.6 @xmath10 s = 1 , n = 282 @xmath10 n = 50 , o = 110 @xmath10 o = 80 , ar = 58.2 @xmath10 ar = 5.0 , and fe = 16 @xmath10 fe = 8 . the changes in the sulphur , nitrogen and argon abundances are relatively large , but this is part due to the fact that except for h , he , o , ne , n and fe , the initial abundances from a96 were not properly constrained ( starrfield 1997 ) .",
    "the sulfur abundance was reduced to 1 ( to be considered as an upper limit ) , in agreement with matheson et al .",
    "1993 , since the [ s  iii ] 6312   line should be negligible compared to [ o  i ] 6300 .",
    "the nitrogen abundance was reduced to 50 to fit the [ n  ii ] 5680/5755   lines , which provides a good match for the early days , but for day 250 and following days the lines are slightly underestimated . the abundance value of n is high when compared to that found by matheson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , but matches the value derived by h96 based on the mid - infrared spectra of nova cygni 92 .",
    "the oxygen abundance was reduced from 110 to 80 to get a better fit for [ o  iii ] 4959/5007 .",
    "we therefore increase the ne / o ratio from 2.3 ( a96 ) to 3.1 , in closer agreement with the value of ne / o=4 found by salama et al .",
    "the n / o ratio gives a value of 0.6 , which is consistent with a white dwarf s mass between 1.25  and 1.35  ( starrfield et al .",
    "1992 ) . from the ar  iii",
    "7135/7007 lines we set an upper limit to the ar abundance of 5 .",
    "finally , the fe abundance was set to fit the fe  iii 5270 and fe  vi 5177 lines .",
    "it is important to remember that the only abundances our models constrain are those for which we have emission line observations .",
    "the abundances we modeled and used are , he=4.5 , n=50.0 , o=80.0 , ne=250.0 , s=1.0 , ar=5.0 , fe=8.0 ( relative to their solar values in which hydrogen is unity ) .",
    "they are within the @xmath11 confidence limits of those listed by a96 , except for n which is difficult to constrain since we do not have the strong nitrogen uv lines to compare ( see shore et al . 1996 ) . the abundances in table 4 include the values for other elements ( following a96 ) , that may not correspond to the best values .",
    "we do not expect , however , that changes in them will modify the spectra .",
    "as politano et al . ( 1995 ) and a96 point out , the high abundances provide further support for the mixing scenario in which core material from the onemg white dwarf is dredged up during the accretion process .",
    "the time evolution of the temperature of the ionizing source undergoes three different phases ( see table 3 ) : a rapid rise during days 140 through 250 ( at least ) , reaching a plateau ( in our data ) at around day 400 , and beginning to decline after day 506 .",
    "these phases are necessary to explain the different observed ionization stages as a function of time and they are consistent with the behavior of the x - ray flux observed with rosat by krautter et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .    as it is explained by krautter et al .",
    "( 1996 ) thermonuclear runaway models of the nova outburst ( starrfield , 1989 ) , predict that not all of the accreted material is ejected during the outburst .",
    "the remaining material ( ranging from 10% to 90% ) would radiate at a constant luminosity .",
    "as mass is lost from this system and the white dwarf shrinks back to its equilibrium radius , the effective temperature of the remnant increases .",
    "krautter et al .",
    "( 1996 ) related the decline in the x - ray flux with a decrease of the white dwarf s temperature , due to the turnoff of thermonuclear burning at its surface .",
    "the temperature for the central source that we derived for the different models is consistent with the @xmath12 confidence temperature values obtained by a96 .",
    "our central source temperatures are lower in the rise phase than those obtained by h96 based on mid - infrared data , but they are similar during the plateau and decline phases .    in the models we used a simple approximation of a constant luminosity of l@xmath13 = @xmath14 erg s@xmath15 for the central source to minimize the number of initial parameters to study .",
    "the constant bolometric luminosity phase depends on the mass of the white dwarf , and according to krautter et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , lasts at least 511 days for nova cygni 1992 ( see also shore et al .",
    "a value of @xmath14 erg s@xmath15 was also used by h96 up to day 616 , but it was reduced to @xmath16 erg s@xmath15 for day 849 .",
    "a luminosity of @xmath14 erg s@xmath15 is then clearly too high for our models corresponding to the 1381 and 1581 days .",
    "( see note on days 1381 and 1581 on next section for further discussion ) .",
    "in all our models the physical radius of the shell ( see table 3 ) was derived from hst images ( paresce et al .",
    "1995 ) taking the mean value between the major and minor axes of the observed elliptical ring and adopting a distance of 2.8 kpc ( a96 ) . for days 1381 and 1581 we assumed a mean expansion velocity of 620 km s@xmath15 .",
    "this is smaller than the 1100 km s@xmath15 derived above from the line shape model , but it is not critical for the line ratios .",
    "as it is expected from a constant expansion velocity shell , the density decreases approximately as @xmath17 .",
    "our results agree well with those found by a96 , hayward et al .",
    "1996 and paresce et al . 1995 .",
    "the thickness ( @xmath18r ) of the shell became an important parameter for days 1381 and 1581 , when the shell changed from being radiation - bounded to matter - bounded .",
    "a similar behavior was found by morisset et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , where the shell became matter - bounded by day 800 .",
    "we chose a constant thickness of @xmath19 cm , which is the average between the lower and upper limit given by a96 . for days 1381 and 1581",
    "this value is also consistent with the criteria followed by h96 who adopted a thickness equal to a value of a @xmath20 the radius of the shell .",
    "saizar et al .",
    "( 1996 ) also suggest that since the [ o  i ] 6300/63 lines trace the presence of neutral gas , the lines can be used to determine when the shell changes from ionization - bounded to matter - bounded .",
    "the [ o  i ] lines are present in the spectra up to day 639 , but they disappear by day 1381 , indicating when the shell was matter - bounded .      the comparison between between observations and models for the first seven epochs ( i.  e. 85 through 565 ) is quite reasonable , and this can be seen for instance in the [ o  iii ] 5007 + 4959/4363 line ratio ( see figure  11 ) . the ratio can be used to determine the electron temperature ( @xmath21 ) in the ejecta , for a range in the electron density of @xmath22 , and for values of @xmath21 of @xmath23 k ( see e.  g. osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "departures from these ranges indicates in general a more complex ionization structure . by day 565 , one begins to notice some difference between our simple models and the observations .",
    "these differences are more noticeable for the last two epochs of our observations , 1381 and 1581 .    for days 1381 and 1581",
    ", we encountered several problems .",
    "first , the lack of consecutive observations during the 1994@xmath2495 period makes it very difficult to follow the time evolution of the white dwarf temperature and the hydrogen density ( the main parameters we try to determine ) .",
    "second , as it was mentioned before , the luminosity of white dwarf is expected to decrease considerably after day 600 .",
    "h96 suggest it goes down to @xmath16 erg s@xmath15 by day 849 .",
    "as we already mentioned our approximation of a constant luminosity of @xmath14 erg s@xmath15 is clearly too high for those days .",
    "we ran several models with a lower value of @xmath16 erg s@xmath15 and the general tendency was that the [ ne  v]3346 and [ ne  v]3426 lines did not appear in the models , while they are clearly present in the observations .",
    "third , the ionizing spectrum at late times may depart significantly from a blackbody .",
    "fourth , our models for days 1381 and 1581 were very sensitive to the thickness of the shell chosen , since the ionization structure of h , he , c , n and o depends strongly on the radius .",
    "our simple approach of a single uniform density shell for these latter days , however , is not appropriate .",
    "h96 in their modeling of the mid - infrared spectra , have used `` multiple components '' to reproduce the observations , i.e. three zones with different physical characteristics ( dense , intermediate and diffuse ) .",
    "the contrast among these three components becomes more drastic after approximately day 600 .",
    "we have used a `` single '' component model up to day 639 , with relatively good results .",
    "nevertheless for days 1381 and 1581 this approximation seems to break down .",
    "for example , our synthetic spectra can not reproduce the [ oiii](5007 + 4959)/4363 ratio , which is overestimated by a large factor .",
    "since high ratios are indicative of low density material , the fact that the ratio is greatly overestimated indicate that a single low - density component model is not valid at late times , when the emission is probably dominated by denser clumps .",
    "the spectra of nova cygni 1992 display some very high ionization lines of [ fe vi ] , [ fe vii ] and [ fe x ] .",
    "the highest ionization forbidden fine - structure emission lines or coronal lines are expected to arise in a high temperature low density gas ; whether this gas is heated by photoionization alone or by the interaction through shocks of the ejecta with the circumstellar material , is still not known .",
    "a96 and h96 found in their studies that photoionization alone fully accounts for the coronal lines seen in the optical and in the mid - infrared .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by wagner and depoy ( 1996 ) who concludes that the observed ir spectrum of nova cygni 1992 and the inferred electron temperature are inconsistent with an origin in a high - velocity shock - heated gas . from hst observations",
    "paresce et al .",
    "( 1995 ) also found that shocks are not responsible for a substantial part of the emission . on the other hand , greenhouse et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , determined from studies on quvul that photoionization is insufficient to account for the spatial extent of the coronal - emitting region .",
    "figure  12 shows the [ fe  vi ] 5146/77 , [ fe  vii ] 6087 + ca  v 6087 and [ fe  x ] 6374 coronal emission lines as a function of time and they are compared with the behavior of the `` super - soft''x - rays [ 0.1 @xmath24 2.4 kev ] observed by rosat ( krautter et al .",
    "1996 ) and the values predicted by the models . on the one hand the similar behavior of the three quantities strongly suggests that an important fraction of the iron coronal lines could be due to photoionization . on the other hand all the lines are found to be systematically underestimated which may indicate some contribution from shocks .",
    "it is also possible that the strength of the fe lines reflects our chosen fe abundance , which was reduced by a factor of two to match the spectra .",
    "furthermore , the fe x 6374 line is blended with the [ o  i ] 6363 line , so to obtain its flux we subtracted one third of the [ o  i ] 6300 line from the blend ( assuming too that the contribution from the [ s  iii ] 6312 line was negligible ) .",
    "it could be also the case that the coronal lines are produced as a `` skin effect '' on the lower - density or rarified surfaces of denser clumps , which could explain the difference between the observed and modeled fe lines .",
    "multiple component models would be required to explore this in more detail .",
    "the spectroscopic time evolution of nova cygni 1992 has been studied using 4 years of observations coupled with the synthetic spectral models , in order to learn more about the physical conditions of its emitting gaseous shell .",
    "the line fluxes for the models were obtained using a photoionization code ( cloudy ) , where the chemical gas abundances were kept _ fixed _ as a function of time .",
    "the models are consistent with the results from similar studies ( austin et al . 1996 ) , although they require less drastic enhancements in the gas abundances of the heavy metals , in particular for sulphur , argon ( which were not modeled by a96 ) and nitrogen .",
    "the time evolution of the surface temperature of the ionizing source ( which it is assumed to be a black body ) follows three phases ( a rise , a plateau and a decline ) and it ranges from log(t ) = 4.9 - 5.63 , similar to what it is observed in the soft x - rays ( krautter et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the line profiles can be reproduced using a simple kinematical model , consisting of an equatorial ring and polar caps with slightly different densities ( 6.7@xmath2510@xmath26 - 9.5@xmath2510@xmath26 @xmath27 respectively ) , expanding at an average velocity of 1100  km / s .",
    "the fe coronal emission lines follow also the time behavior observed in the soft x - rays , which suggests a common energy source for their photoionization . that the fe line fluxes are slightly underestimated ,",
    "may indicate nevertheless that the contributions from shocks may also be important .",
