    "due to hydrophobic repulsions , amphiphilic molecules such as lipids spontaneously aggregate in water to form bilayer membranes .",
    "these bilayers typically exhibit an in - plane fluidlike nature , and are highly flexible surfaces so they can display a large variety of conformations .",
    "the experimental study of equilibrium lipid bilayers has attracted a great deal of attention in the past decades  @xcite .",
    "issues such as membrane conformational behavior , shape fluctuations , fusion and fission , and phase segregation in multicomponent bilayers have been extensively investigated  @xcite . among many other manipulation techniques , the fabrication of synthetic giant vesicles and planar lipid membranes  @xcite as well as micropipet aspiration",
    "@xcite have been used to perform these studies , leading to a fairly detailed current understanding of equilibrium membranes .",
    "parallel to the experimental advances , theoretical modeling of equilibrium flexible membranes has also come a long way .",
    "typical theoretical approaches are based on the search for minimum energy conformations according to the canham - helfrich bending elasticity description  @xcite of a tensionless membrane , plus ( optionally ) the corresponding area - difference contributions for closed surfaces  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been recognized that internal degrees of freedom such as chemical composition can crucially influence the shape of the bilayer , especially when dealing with multicomponent membranes undergoing phase separation . in particular ,",
    "models containing a local coupling between composition and curvature have been developed  @xcite , resulting in an interesting outcome , namely , the appearance of phase separating domains that grow and adopt distinct membrane curvatures .",
    "this is understood as the initiation mechanism for budding phenomena in real membranes .",
    "kinetic mesoscopic schemes , monte carlo approaches , and a variety of discrete dynamic algorithms have been proposed on this basis , and have mainly been devoted to the study of the equilibrium behavior and the dynamics toward equilibrium of flexible bilayers .",
    "the ultimate motivation for the study of lipid bilayers lies in their likeness to cell membranes .",
    "a biological membrane is a complex mixture of lipids , sterols and proteins that represents the main structural component of the cell architecture . rather than an inert static boundary",
    ", a membrane has to be viewed as a dynamical surface directly and actively involved in many biological cell processes  @xcite .",
    "in addition to their compositional complexity , cell membranes are also continuously subjected to nonequilibrium driving forces , chemical gradients , and energy fluxes , so it should be recognized that nonequilibrium behavior may underlie many aspects of their dynamics  @xcite .",
    "therefore , although experimental and theoretical studies on thermally equilibrated membranes have had considerable success and are a good starting point , nonequilibrium approaches are fundamental for a more accurate understanding of the dynamical properties of both natural membranes and synthetic lipid bilayers",
    ".    excellent work on nonequilibrium lipid bilayers has recently been presented by the experimental groups of j. prost and h .-",
    "j. prost et al .",
    "have studied the effects of active proteins inserted in a vesicle membrane .",
    "acting as ion pumps externally activated by light , these proteins provide a nonthermal energy source that directly affects membrane shape behavior  @xcite . as an example of another nonequilibrium source , h .-",
    "dbereiner et al . investigated the morphological transformations of a vesicle membrane due to a photoinduced chemical reaction that modifies the local lipid composition of the bilayer  @xcite .",
    "some progress has also been made on the modeling front .",
    "for example , parallel to their experimental findings , a novel nonequilibrium scheme has been proposed by j. prost et al .",
    "that successfully explains the observed experimental phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "in addition to this proposal , other nonequilibrium situations have been modeled very recently , such as those of membranes confined between parallel plates  @xcite , membranes with active inclusions  @xcite , and bilayers near repulsive walls  @xcite .",
    "we are mainly interested in the nonequilibrium situation proposed by h .-",
    "dbereiner et al .",
    ", where the bilayer s own lipid constituents are chemically transformed , leading to changes in the membrane curvature .",
    "the influence of lipid composition on the curvature of cell membranes has recently been established in cell fusion processes where high - curvature lipids play an important role  @xcite .",
    "chemically induced lipid modifications are also known to be responsible for membrane shape transformations involved in nervous synaptic processes such as the formation of microvesicles that release the neurotransmitter to the gap between two nerve cells  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in addition to biological membranes , an understanding of the coupling between chemical reactions and the interfacial curvature is essential in elucidating dynamical processes in artificial bilayers that may be useful in nanotechnology applications . as an example",
    ", self - assembly techniques based on biomineralization can lead to hierarchically organized materials built from reactive amphiphilic interfaces  @xcite .",
    "based on the nonequilibrium ingredients described above , in a previous paper  @xcite we presented a model for a two - component reactive membrane that exhibits a particular compositional and morphological organization . in that model",
    "the two lipid constituents have a distinctly different shape , so that they are able to produce distinct curvatures in the membrane .",
    "moreover , they are assumed to be thermodynamically immiscible , so they spontaneously induce the development of phase separating domains .",
    "additionally , an externally induced reaction ( promoted by a nonequilibrium source such as a chemical flux , an applied light , etc . ) interconverts the two lipids .",
    "the combination of these ingredients leads to stationary patterns involving heterogeneous modulations of composition and curvature .",
    "the novelty of the resulting pattern organization is that although stationary , the patterns are generated in a nonequilibrium context , that is , they are actively maintained by the competition between thermodynamic ( equilibrium ) phase separation and the environmentally induced ( nonequilibrium ) reaction . at thermal equilibrium , the low affinity between the two immiscible components generates domains with a characteristic composition and curvature . in the absence of reaction",
    ", these domains grow indefinitely and coalesce until complete segregation into two large domains is achieved .",
    "however , the reactive process converts one lipid component into the other , resulting in a large - scale mixing mechanism that halts the growth of the segregated structures when the mixing action balances the short - scale ordering effect of phase separation .",
    "this balance leads to a stationary state with patterns of a finite size .    in our previous model  @xcite",
    ", we assumed that the nonthermal energy contribution that promoted the lipid interconversion reaction simply dissipates to the medium . in this paper",
    "we generalize our original model to the case where such an energetic process directly alters the membrane shape by exerting local forces on it , that is , the induced reactive process locally kicks the membrane .",
    "conformational changes of the membrane constituents due to the reaction can reasonably be expected to have mechanical effects on the membrane .",
    "we model this effect in a very generic way , and will demonstrate that the inclusion of this new ingredient is essential for the generation of dynamic spatial organization . as a typical feature of soft - matter systems , robust spatiotemporal phenomena such as those displayed in this paper are interesting in their applicability to real bilayer membranes .",
    "although our ideas are inspired by phenomena observed in real cellular systems , we hasten to disclaim a direct analogy between our model and in vivo systems which are far more complex than our stripped model .",
    "we only wish to suggest that the mechanisms proposed herein might play a role in real membranes in which the energy sources for the local membrane - shape - altering processes might include atp consumption , the asborption of light , or any of a number of other possible energy providing mechanisms .",
    "we point out here and again later in the paper that the spatiotemporal structures of interest require parameters that constrain the range of applicability of the model .",
    "in particular , we will see that elastic properties ( bending rigidity ) play a central role , and that the most likely candidates for the observation of our predictions due to their flexibility are in vitro lipid bilayers formed from single- and/or short - chain lipid surfactants , especially those composed of surfactants of rather distinct shapes that are interconverted by a reactive process that can be controlled experimentally .",
    "we discuss these and other possibilities for experimental realization later in the paper .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",

    "the last term is the elastic energy contribution due to the rigidity of the membrane , and @xmath10 is the bending rigidity modulus .",
