    "recent years , higher dimensional black holes have become one of the key objects of the modern high energy physics . in brane world scenarios with large extra dimensions@xcite",
    ", it was suggested that mini black holes may be created in particle colliders@xcite , which encouraged thereby detailed investigation of behavior of particles and fields around the black holes . among important processes ,",
    "the proper oscillations of higher dimensional black holes as a response to an external perturbations have been actively studied recently @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these oscillations are governed by the so - called quasinormal modes , which have been in the focus of gravitational research during recent years because of a few reasons .",
    "first , quasinormal modes are expected to be an observed fingerprint of a black hole s gravitational waves with the help of a new generation of gravitational antennas .",
    "second , for some asymptotically anti de sitter space - times the quasinormal modes have interpretation in the dual conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite , and help thereby to study some finite temperature field theory processes , such as hydrodynamics of quark - gluon plasma @xcite in cft .",
    "finally , complete numerical investigation of quasinormal modes makes it possible to prove ( in)stability for some black holes , when analytical proof is difficult @xcite .",
    "usually , the asymptotic flatness of black hole spacetimes , which is an idealization of the boundary condition for isolated systems , is required in four dimensions . in higher dimensions , however , since the extra dimensions are expected to be compactified into a small scale , so - called kaluza - klein geometry , then the higher dimensional black holes have the asymptotic structure of the kaluza - klein type .",
    "it is interesting to study how the compactness of the extra dimension affects the quasinormal modes of the kaluza - klein black holes .",
    "the simplest example of five - dimensional black objects with the kaluza - klein geometry is the black string , the direct product of four - dimensional black hole and a circle .",
    "these objects look different from four - dimensional black hole only at sufficiently high energies , when kaluza - klein modes are excited @xcite . therefore within these space - times",
    "we need high energy regime to see the extra dimension .",
    "if we allow the asymptotic structure of twisted s@xmath0 bundle over four - dimensional minkowski space - time , there exist exact solutions of kaluza - klein black holes with squashed horizons for neutral  @xcite , charged  @xcite , and extremely charged cases  @xcite .",
    "such black holes look like five - dimensional squashed black holes near the event horizon , and like a kaluza - klein space - time at spatial infinity , i.e. , locally a direct product of four - dimensional minkowski space - time and a circle .",
    "physical properties of the squashed kaluza - klein black holes are studied in @xcite , and generalizations of them appear in @xcite . owing to the non - trivial bundle structure , the size of the extra dimension might be observed even at low energies@xcite .",
    "then , it is interesting to study the the quasinormal modes of the squashed kaluza - klein black holes .",
    "this is even more motivated if we take into account that squashed kaluza - klein black holes are gravitationally stable @xcite .    in the present paper we study evolution of perturbations of squashed kaluza - klein black holes both in time and frequency domains and find the quasinormal spectrum for scalar field and gravitational perturbations of these black holes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec ii we study the quasinormal modes of scalar field perturbations around rotating kaluza - klein black holes with squashed horizon .",
    "sec iii is devoted to gravitational perturbations of non - rotating black holes . finally in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the obtained results .",
    "in this section , we investigate the quasinormal modes of the scalar field in the rotating uncharged squashed kaluza - klein black holes .",
    "the five - dimensional rotating squashed kk black hole with two equal angular momenta is described by@xcite @xmath1+\\frac{\\mu}{r^2+a^2}(dt-\\frac{a}{2}\\sigma_3)^2 , \\label{metric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the parameters are given by @xmath6 here @xmath7 and @xmath8 are parameters which correspond to mass and angular momenta , respectively . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are outer and inner horizons of the black hole and they relate to @xmath7 and @xmath8 by @xmath11 .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 corresponds to the spatial infinity . in the parameter space @xmath13 , @xmath14",
    "is restricted within the range @xmath15 .",
    "the shape of black hole horizon is deformed by @xmath16 .",
    "the wave equation for the massless scalar field @xmath17 in the background ( [ metric ] ) obeys @xmath18 taking the ansatz @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the so - called spheroidal harmonics , the radial and time variables can be decoupled from angular ones , so that the final wave - like equation reads    @xmath21 + \\bigg[\\frac{\\tilde{h}^2}{\\delta}+\\lambda - l(l+1)+\\lambda^2\\bigg]r(\\rho)=0,\\label{radial}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 is the non - negative integer multipole number , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are integers , and @xmath25 ^ 2 , \\\\ & & \\lambda=\\frac{4\\rho^2_0r^6_{\\infty}(\\rho+\\rho_0)^2}{h^2(r^2_{\\infty}+a^2)^4}\\omega^2- \\frac{4\\lambda^2(\\rho+\\rho_0)^2}{r^2_{\\infty}+a^2 } , \\\\ & & h^2=\\frac{\\rho+\\rho_0}{\\rho+\\frac{a^2}{r^2_{\\infty}+a^2}\\rho_0}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the radial coordinate @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 with @xmath28 note that the three parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 can define the metric ( [ metric ] ) if @xmath31 . in some papers they are used to parameterize the black hole instead of the parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 .    in frequency domain we used the following frobenius expansion @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are chosen in order to eliminate the singularities at @xmath9 and @xmath38 .",
    "the sign of @xmath35 and @xmath37 is chosen in order to remain them in the same complex quadrant as @xmath39 .",
    "we substitute ( [ frobenius ] ) into ( [ radial ] ) and obtain the recurrence relation for the coefficients @xmath40 . after the recurrence relation is known we can find the equation with the infinite continued fraction with respect to @xmath39 , which can be solved numerically @xcite .",
    "the fundamental quasinormal modes will be of our primary interest hereafter , when dealing with frequency domain , because fundamental modes dominate in a late time oscillations .",
    "contribution of all overtones can be seen in time domain considered in the next section .",
    "the fundamental modes for different values of @xmath41 are shown in fig.[real_part ] and fig.[imaginary_part ] , and tables 1 and 2 . there",
    "one can see that the real oscillation frequency exerts some irregular growth ( with local minimums ) when @xmath12 is increasing until some moderately large values of @xmath12 . at larger @xmath12 the growth of @xmath42 changes into monotonic decay .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath39 that determines the damping rate also has some initial irregular growth when @xmath12 increases , but at larger @xmath12 the two scenarios are possible : either monotonic decay ( for large values of ratio @xmath43 ) or monotonic growth ( for small and moderate @xmath43 ) ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . thus , for a given mass and angular momentum of the black hole , one can learn the size of extra dimension @xmath12 from values of quasinormal modes of the emitted radiation .",
    "the calculations performed with the help of the frobenius method are accurate and wkb values given here are rather an additional check . from tables 1 and 2 we can see that for small values of ratio @xmath44 the wkb method extended until the 6th wkb order beyond the eikonal approximation @xcite is in a very good agreement with the frobenius method , but the larger @xmath44 the worse convergence of the wkb series .     and @xmath32 ( @xmath45 ) . ]     and @xmath32 ( @xmath45 ) .",

    "in the present paper we considered the quasinormal spectrum of the scalar and gravitational perturbations for squashed kaluza - klein black holes .",
    "the quasinormal frequencies of the scalar field are different from those of the schwarzschild black holes and have smaller real oscillation frequencies and longer lived for not very larger @xmath50 .",
    "the obtained evolution of gravitational perturbations shows damped oscillations in time domain , so that no instability is observed in concordance with analytically proved stability in @xcite .",
    "let us note that we analyzed here only `` zero mode '' perturbations , so that , strictly speaking , the opportunity for instability is remained in higher multipole perturbations .",
    "yet we do not expect instability at higher multipoles because , unlike @xmath51 mode , @xmath52 mode does not have negative gap , so that higher @xmath53 seem simply to increase the height of the potential barrier and stabilize the system .",
    "it is interesting that if we know the quasinormal frequency we can find the size of the extra dimension in the considered black hole model , so that quasinormal modes give a kind of opportunity to `` look into '' an extra dimension at low energies . in detail , when a dominant quasinormal mode is measured",
    ", then one can look into tables and plot numerical data in this paper and find out which is the value of @xmath50 and the radius of the event horizon that corresponds to the observed quasinormal mode . in this way we can determine the parameters of the black hole and the size of the extra dimension , assuming that there exists no other kaluza - klein black holes with similar features .",
    "our next step in the line of this research is to consider gravitational perturbations of the rotating squashed kaluza - klein black holes .",
    "charged kaluza - klein black holes , especially maximally charged cases , are also interesting targets for investigating quasinormal modes , because the quasinormal frequencies of the maxwell field and the gravitational field coincide in four - dimensional super - symmetric black holes@xcite . to check the stability of these black holes is an important problem .",
    "as the potential is frequency dependent and cumbersome , one definitely needs quasinormal modes analysis to test stability .",
