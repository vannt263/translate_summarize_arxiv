    "relativistic poynting - flux dominated jets have been suggested to occur in various astrophysical outflows , including active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , pulsars , micro - quasars and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "the alternative situation , that the jet is accelerated through thermal pressure gradients , has been ruled out for agns , based on the available thermal power at the jet s base @xcite .",

    "this problem is referred to as the synchrotron `` line of death '' @xcite .",
    "other problems with a synchrotron origin for the prompt phase involve the narrow peak energy distribution and the apparent sharp decline of the peak energy distribution above 1 mev @xcite , although this could also be due to a selection effect @xcite , and the narrow spectral width of the observed  band function \" as compared with the synchrotron peak @xcite . the main alternative to synchrotron is photospheric emission",
    ". the photospheric emission component can be powerful .",
    "it is characterized by hard low - energy spectral slopes and , provided that there is energy dissipation close to the photosphere , a broader spectrum that resembles the observed one @xcite .",
    "photospheric emission models have their own share of problems , such as the need for a significant amount of dissipation and non - thermal acceleration deep below the photosphere @xcite and various grbs in which strong limits have been put on the thermal component @xcite .    in magnetic jets ,",
    "the outflow may be composed of wound - up magnetic field lines in a  striped wind \" configuration @xcite , in which their polarity is reversed over a typical distance @xmath10 .",
    "reconnection is then the most efficient process for dissipating the magnetic energy and transferring it to the emitting particles @xcite .",
    "many studies @xcite have therefore recently considered reconnection models as strong candidates for reproducing the prompt sub - mev emission . in mhd jets ,",
    "the energy dissipation through reconnection occurs gradually over a wide range of radii @xcite . at small radii ,",
    "the jet is optically thick and photons produced via synchrotron emission are thermalized , leading to , to a zeroth approximation , a black body - like signature from the photosphere @xcite . assuming that the dissipated energy heats smoothly the flow ( e.g. , a slow heating scenario following @xcite )",
    ", @xcite showed that comptonization close to the photosphere distorts the spectrum resulting in a high - energy power - law tail . at larger radii ,",

    "the emitted radiation sed from both the @xmath11 surface and the optically thin parts of the jet sensitively depends , however , on the assumptions on the injected particle spectrum at various scales in the jet .",
    "recent progress in understanding the non - thermal processes at the reconnection layer allow us to revisit this problem .",
    "in particular , recent pic simulations have demonstrated that magnetic reconnection in a high magnetization @xmath12 ( where @xmath12 is the ratio of the poynting flux to kinetic luminosities ) plasma results in extended , power - law particle distribution .",

    "previous works have focused on one or just a few of these various ingredients . in this work",
    "we combine the mhd dynamics , the details of the dissipation process as implied by new results from pic simulations and a simple calculation for the emerging emission within a self - consistent model .",
    "this model has a rather small number of free parameters : the jet luminosity , @xmath13 , the  wavelength \" of the structured magnetic field in the jet over the outflow velocity from the reconnection sites , @xmath14 , the initial total energy per baryon , @xmath15 , and the fraction of accelerated electrons , @xmath16 .",
    "the dynamical ranges of these parameters are expected to be quite small .",
    "it is naturally expected to result in spectra peaking around @xmath0kev ( as observed ) and with spectral indices that closely match the observed values .",
    "in addition , the small radius of dissipation causes the spectrum to become self absorbed at a few kev and can sufficiently suppress the optical and x - ray fluxes below the upper limits required by observations @xcite .",
    "we consider a poynting flux dominated outflow that is composed of a  striped wind \" magnetic field configuration @xcite , in which the typical  wavelength \" of the field is @xmath10 .",

    "the flow starts at @xmath34 with the alfven speed @xmath36 and accelerates as @xmath12 decreases ( so we can assume @xmath37 ) .",
    "the total luminosity ( per steradian ) at this radius is the magnetic plus kinetic components : @xmath38 assuming that a fraction of order unity of the dissipated energy goes towards accelerating the flow , we have that at any given radius @xmath39 .",

    "in particular @xmath62 as is required by the fact that all of the available energy is dissipated by @xmath42 .",
    "pic simulations suggest that @xmath16 is of order unity , i.e. , a large fraction of the electrons undergo acceleration at the current sheet @xcite .",

    "the general tendency is that thermalization is achieved at large optical depths while the @xmath103 region is dominated by synchrotron emission .",

    "this requires a more involved calculation and is beyond the scope of the current work , in which we aim to highlight the qualitative features of the model at hand .",
    "we return briefly to discuss the validity of this simplifying assumption after describing the synchrotron frequencies and in  [ sec : comptonization ] .    at small radii ( below the photosphere ) , photons and matter are in thermodynamic equilibrium , both sharing some temperature @xmath105 .",

    "however , electrons accelerated due to reconnection below the photosphere may produce sufficient synchrotron photons for complete thermalization to take place . a deviation from a black - body spectrum ,",

    "[ eq : nusynmax ] provides a rough upper limit on the observable synchrotron photons in this model .",
    "although a few higher energy photons have been observed in some bursts , it has been argued that they could originate from the external forward shock @xcite .",
    "finally , various correlations of the type @xmath208 or @xmath209 have been reported in grb literature @xcite .",
    "typically , studies of this type have found that @xmath210 . assuming that the location and luminosity of the peak is dominated by the thermal component",
    ", we have @xmath211 .",
    "therefore , a correlation similar to the observed one can be realized if , for instance , @xmath212 and @xmath14 is not strongly correlated with the other parameters ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "assuming this relation between @xmath15 and @xmath13 , would imply that the above correlations would also hold for different pulses within a given burst , as was indeed observed in several cases @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it would naturally result in an intensity tracking evolution within a given pulse @xcite and in pulse widening at lower frequencies @xcite and spectral lags @xcite .",
    "we considered a model for the prompt phase of grb emission arising from a magnetized outflow undergoing gradual energy dissipation due to magnetic reconnection .",
    "the dissipated magnetic energy is translated to bulk kinetic energy in the jet and to acceleration of particles .",
    "the energy stored in these particles is released in the form of synchrotron radiation as they gyrate around the strong magnetic fields in the jet . at small radii ,",
    "the optical depth is large , and the emission is reprocessed through comptonization into a narrow , quasi thermal , component . at larger distances",
    "the optical depth becomes small and the radiation escapes the system in non - thermal form .",
    "the overall efficiency of the radiation ( as compared with the jet power ) is of order @xmath184 , as required by afterglow observations .",
    "the peak of the spectrum in this model is dominated by the photospheric component , and is expected to reside at the sub - mev range , as observed in prompt grbs .",
    "furthermore , possible correlations with the luminosity ( both when comparing different pulses in a given grb , and between different grbs ) are possible depending on the inter - relations of the model s intrinsic parameters , the jet luminosity , @xmath13 , the  wavelength \" of the structured magnetic field in the jet over the outflow velocity from the reconnection sites , @xmath14 and the initial total energy per baryon , @xmath15 . this would then also lead to an intensity tracking evolution within a given grb pulse , to pulse widening at lower frequencies and to spectral lags , all of which have also been reported in observational prompt grb studies .",
    "for matter ejected from the central engine with @xmath201 , the emission is completely thermalized .",
    "this may account for the common phenomena of x - ray flares .",
    "the temperature can be reduced to @xmath213kev , by assuming , for instance , @xmath214 @xcite .",
    "this leads to a flare luminosity which is @xmath215 which is rather typical for a flare occurring a few hundred seconds after the trigger @xcite . due to the typically small signal to noise ratio , the spectra of these flares",
    "can not be measured except for very few cases .",
    "there is some suggestion that the brightest flares can be fitted ( in the x - ray band ) with a power - law spectrum : @xmath216 @xcite , which would be incompatible with the expectations for the low @xmath15 material .",
    "however the spectrum must become significantly harder at lower frequencies to be compatible with contemporaneous upper limits on the optical flux , which is suggestive of a photospheric origin @xcite .",
    "the non - thermal synchrotron component leads to a softening of the spectrum below the thermal peak and to hardening of the spectrum above it . for our canonical parameters ( see  [ sec : results ] ) , we find that the low energy spectral slope is @xmath175 and the high energy spectral slope is @xmath179 .",
    "more generally , given the expected ranges of the intrinsic parameters in the model , these indices are expected to reside in the range @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "another observational test for any grb model involving magnetically dominated jets , has to do with the emitted fluxes in the optical and x - ray bands , as compared with observational upper limits . @xcite",
    "have shown that one zone magnetic models over - produce synchrotron emission in these environments . as is shown in figs .",
    "4,5 of @xcite the typical radius and electrons lorentz factor at the photosphere in the model considered here ( @xmath219 ) are consistent with the upper limits on the optical and x - ray fluxes from observations ( this is mainly due to the spectrum being self absorbed below a few kev ) .",
    "furthermore , due to the gradual energy release in this model , a significant fraction of radiation is produced below the photosphere and re - processed to a thermal form , so the very short cooling times associated with the synchrotron process in these conditions ( as compared with the dynamical one ) do not imply that synchrotron dominates the peak of the emission , thus overcoming the constraints presented in @xcite for one zone models .",
    "the basic model presented here consists of relatively few parameters , with rather narrow ranges : @xmath220 where the latter two are informed by the latest pic simulations .",
    "the model seems to be able to account for the basic prompt grb observations .",
    "simulations treating the jet dynamics , particle acceleration and radiation self - consistently is required in order to refine the model predictions .",
    "this task can , however , be much more involved and is deferred to future works .",

    "inverse compton of the initially thermal ( black body ) photon spectrum produced below the photosphere by relativistic electrons accelerated in the reconnection sites , can lead to a modification of the black - body spectrum in a process known as comptonization .",
    "the importance of comptonization effects can be gauged by estimating the effective compton @xmath111 parameter that is felt by the incident photons .",
    "as we are interested in providing an upper limit on the effectiveness of comptonization , we can safely assume that ic takes place in the thomson regime and neglect kn effects , that could only reduce the optical depth and energy transfer by ic ( and hence the effective compton parameter ) .",
    "since electrons are fast cooling due to synchrotron ( @xmath221 ) , the evolved energy spectrum of the electrons at a given radius is @xmath222 the @xmath111 parameter is given by : @xmath223 where @xmath224 and @xmath225 is the optical depth for ic scatterings and is given by @xmath226 where @xmath227 is the number of accelerated electrons up to the radius @xmath49 ( in the co - moving frame ) .",
    "putting everything together , we find : @xmath228 we find that @xmath229 for @xmath230 .",
    "comptonization effects are therefore expected to be energetically sub - dominant and can not significantly change the typical temperature and flux .",
    "numerical simulations are required to gain an accurate estimate of the actual spectrum above the thermal peak , and are deferred to a future work .",
    "the physical situation is very different if one assumes that the dissipated energy smoothly and continuously heats _ all _ the electrons in the flow . in that case",
    "the compton parameter is @xmath231 for @xmath11 and the compton spectral distortion is pronounced @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , that depending on the model parameters , it is possible to formally have @xmath232 . in this case , the typical lorentz factor of the scattering electrons can not be obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq : gammasquared ] . however , we note that this does not change significantly the estimate of @xmath233 given by eq .",

    "therefore electrons with @xmath237 contribute roughly the same as those , for instance , with @xmath238 , and we do not rely on the latter to obtain the result in eq .",
    "[ eq : y ] . stating it differently ,",
    "the density of electrons with a lorentz factor of order @xmath237 is smaller than the total number of accelerated electrons by the ratio of their cooling time to the dynamical time - scale @xmath239 therefore the effective optical depth for ic scatterings with these electrons is reduced by a factor @xmath240 as compared with eq .",
    "[ eq : tauic ] . at the same time , their lorentz factor squared is simply @xmath241 which is a factor @xmath242 larger than the value in eq .",
