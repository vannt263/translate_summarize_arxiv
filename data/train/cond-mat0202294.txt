    "recently , zaanen brought up a problem of `` quantum string , '' which is a linelike object subjected to line tension , and it wanders owing to quantum zero - point fluctuations @xcite .",
    "central concern is to estimate the interaction among strings as it wanders quantum - mechanically and undergoes entropy - reducing collisions with adjacent neighbors .",
    "statistical mechanics of quantum - string gas would be responsible to the low - energy physics of the stripe phase observed experimentally in doped cuprates @xcite . in particular , one is motivated to gain insights how the stripe pattern acquires stability .",
    "actually , a good deal of theoretical analyses had predicted tendency toward stripe - pattern formation @xcite .",
    "however , _ ab initio _",
    "simulations on the @xmath4-@xmath5 model still remain controversial about that issue @xcite .    in the series of papers @xcite , the authors pointed out that the `` quantum entropic '' interaction lies out of conventional picture , and it would rather give rise to the solidification of the gas of strings ; namely , the stripe phase is stabilized by mutual collisions .",
    "( in a different context , the entropic interaction was explored in refs . . )",
    "their analysis @xcite is based on the helfrich approximation @xcite , which has been very successful in the course of studies of stacked membranes under _ thermal _ undulations .",
    "based on this approximation , they reveled a significance of _ long_-wavelength fluctuations . note that in the conventional picture , on the contrary , the string is `` disordered '' as in the einstein - like view of crystal , and only short - wavelength fluctuations contribute to collisions .",
    "to be specific , the key relation in their theory is the following , @xmath6 with collision - induced energy cost @xmath7 ( per unit volume ) and elasticity modulus ( with respect to the compression of string intervals ) @xmath8 ; see the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) as well .",
    "the logarithmic term signals the significance of long - wavelength fluctuations .",
    "the relation ( [ sc_condition ] ) yields remarkable consequences .",
    "for instance , the elastic modulus is given by the _",
    "stretched _ exponential form @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the elasticity modulus @xmath10 is much larger than that of meanfield @xmath11 .",
    "hence , the result indicates that contrary to our naive expectations , short - wavelength modes are suppressed owing to collisions , and the collisions rather contribute to the solidification of the string gas ; namely , the stripe phase is stabilized by the `` order out of disorder '' mechanism @xcite .    in our preceding paper @xcite ,",
    "we have verified the above relation ( [ sc_condition ] ) , and demonstrated that the elastic modulus is actually governed by the stretched exponential form @xmath12 .",
    "we have carried out the first - principle simulation by means of the density - matrix renormalization group @xcite : we put a quantum string between rigid walls with spacing @xmath1 , and measured its repelling interaction .",
    "( this technique has been utilized in the course of studies of fluctuation pressure of stacked membranes @xcite . )",
    "the hamiltonian is given by , @xmath13 here , @xmath14 denotes the operator of transverse displacement of a particle at @xmath15th site , and @xmath16 is its conjugate momentum .",
    "they satisfy the canonical commutation relations @xmath17={\\rm i}\\hbar \\delta_{ij}$ ] , @xmath18=0 $ ] and @xmath19=0 $ ] .",
    "@xmath20 is the rigid - wall potential with spacing @xmath1 ; @xmath21 @xmath22 denotes the line tension which puts particles into line .",
    "classical version of this hamiltonian has been used as a model for line dislocations and steps on ( vicinal ) surfaces @xcite . note that for sufficiently large @xmath22 , one can take continuum limit , with which one arrives at field - theoretical version of quantum string @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we are concerned in the excitation ( mass ) gap due to the collisions .",
    "we postulate the following exponential singularity , @xmath23 for sufficiently large @xmath1 . in ref .",
    ", the gap ( crossover temperature ) @xmath24 is calculated in the form @xmath25 ; namely , one should obtain @xmath26 .",
    "this result can not be understood in terms of the meanfield picture yielding much smaller mass gap @xmath3 .",
    "( we will outline this picture in the next section . )",
    "the purpose of this paper is to judge the validity of those scenarios by performing first - principle simulations .",
    "our result is @xmath27 for @xmath28-@xmath29 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we argue physical implications of the singularity exponent @xmath30 .",
    "we introduce the viewpoint of critical phenomena in order to interpret the gap formula ( [ exponential ] ) .",
    "the meanfield argument is also explicated . in section [ section_3 ] ,",
    "we perform numerical simulations , and show evidences of the breakdown of meanfield . in the last section ,",
    "we give summary and discussions .",
    "in introduction , we have overviewed the quantum string in the context of the stripe phase . in this section",
    ", we will survey different aspects of the quantum string in terms of statistical mechanics .",
    "this viewpoint is utilized in the simulation - data analyses in the succeeding section [ section_3 ] .    in the path - integral picture ,",
    "a quantum string spans a `` world sheet '' as time evolves @xcite .",
    "therefore , a quantum string is equivalent to the random surface under _ thermal _ undulations .",
    "the random surface is in the critical phase of kosterlitz and thouless .",
    "( in our model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , however , there appears no `` flat phase , '' because the `` height '' variables @xmath31 are continuous . )",
    "the presence of rigid walls is supposed to destroy the kt criticality . therefore , the collision - induced mass gap ( [ exponential ] ) reflects the universality class of the phase transition at @xmath32 . in that sense ,",
    "our aim is to determine the universality class .",
    "the phase transition has not been studied very extensively so far .",
    "the rigid - wall potential is , by nature , non - analytic , and hence , it is quite cumbersome to carry out perturbative analyses such as loop expansions .",
    "moreover , the confinement due to walls destroys the applicability of the duality transformation , with which one could establish an elucidating equivalence between the random surface and the two - dimensional @xmath33 model .    even in computer simulation ,",
    "the verification of the gap formula ( [ exponential ] ) is rather troublesome .",
    "note that the gap opens very slowly .",
    "that is , the correlation length is kept exceedingly large in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "the correlation length would exceed the system sizes . note that the conventional criticality exhibits the _ power law _",
    "singularity , @xmath34 which would be much easier to cope with .",
    "we will overcome the difficulty through resorting to the density - matrix renormalization group @xcite ; with this technique , we treat system sizes up to @xmath35 .",
    "now , we are in a position to discuss the meaning of the singularity exponent @xmath30 .",
    "the correlation length is proportional to the inverse of the excitation ( mass ) gap ; namely , @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 sets the characteristic length scale of the collision intervals .",
    "therefore , in the length scale @xmath38 , the random surface fluctuates freely . and",
    "so , the mean fluctuation deviation is calculated , @xmath39 from this relation , we see that @xmath30 reflects an amount of fluctuation amplitudes . in the meantime ,",
    "the meanfield picture insists @xmath40 .",
    "( more precisely , an artificial mass term is included so as to enforce the condition ; see refs . . )",
    "hence , one should obtain , @xmath41 in the meanfield picture .    on the contrary ,",
    "as is mentioned in introduction , recent theory @xcite predicts much smaller singularity exponent @xmath26 , from which one obtains a counterintuitive result @xmath42 .",
    "the result indicates that the string is straightened macroscopically by collisions : this is quite reminiscent of the aforementioned claim that the infrared modes are still active withstanding the collisions @xcite .",
    "similar , but slightly modest , exponent @xmath43 was reported ( in a different context ) with analytical calculations @xcite .",
    "in this section , we perform first - principle simulations so as to estimate the singularity exponent @xmath30 . first , we will explicate the simulation algorithm .",
    "the density - matrix renormalization group has been utilized for the purpose of treating very large system sizes @xcite .",
    "the technique is based on an elaborate reduction of the hilbert - space bases , and it has been applied to various spin and electron systems very successfully @xcite . meanwhile ,",
    "the technique had become applicable to bosonic systems such as phonons and oscillators @xcite .",
    "( note that the full exact diagonalization does not apply , because even a single oscillator spans infinite - dimensional fock space .",
    "the huge dimensionality overwhelms the computer memory space . ) here , we employ the density - matrix - renormalization technique in order to diagonalize the quantum string ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "full account of technical details is presented in our preceding paper @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will outline the simulation algorithm with an emphasis on the modification to calculate the excitation gap precisely .    to begin with , we need to set up local ( on site ) hilbert - space bases : provided that the line tension @xmath22 is turned off , oscillators are independent , and each of them reduces to the text - book problem of `` particle in a box . ''",
    "hence , the full set of eigensystems is calculated easily . in this way",
    ", we set up the intra - site hilbert space with use of the low - lying @xmath44 states , and discarded the others .",
    "secondly , provided that those intra - site bases are at hand , we are able to apply the density - matrix renormalization group .",
    "the total system consists of block , site , site and block .",
    "the left - half part ( block and site ) is renormalized into a new block with reduced dimensionality @xmath45 ; we set , at most , @xmath46 .",
    "more precisely , those @xmath45 bases are chosen from the eigenvectors of the density matrix for the left - half part , @xmath47 with the largest @xmath45 eigenvalues .",
    "@xmath48 denotes the partial trace with respect to the right - half part , and @xmath49 with the ground state @xmath50 and the first excitation state @xmath51 of the total system .",
    "note that in our previous simulation @xcite , we simply set @xmath52 , because we were just concerned in the ground state properties .    to summarize , we had carried out truncations of bases through two steps : one is the truncation of the intra - site bases @xmath53 , and the other is the truncation of the `` block '' states @xmath45 through the density - matrix renormalization .",
    "each of these procedures is monitored carefully , and the relative error of low - lying energy levels is kept within @xmath54 ; see ref . for details .",
    "we have repeated renormalizations 20-times .",
    "the system size reaches @xmath35 .",
    "we have plotted the energy gap against the inverse of wall spacing @xmath55 for several values of line tension @xmath22 ; see fig .",
    "[ figure_gap ] . from the plot",
    ", we see that the gap opens extremely slowly ; namely , in the range @xmath56 , the mass gap @xmath57 is maintained to be very small .",
    "this is a typical signature of the exponential singularity ( [ exponential ] ) rather than the power law ( [ power ] ) . for @xmath58 , the simulation does not continue ,",
    "because the numerical diagonalization fails in resolving the nearly degenerate low - lying levels .    in the inset ,",
    "we have presented the logarithmic plot .",
    "the data exhibit convex curves .",
    "hence , we see that the singularity exponent @xmath30 would not exceed @xmath43 .",
    "as is mentioned in section [ section_2 ] , the meanfield argument predicts @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , we found that the collision - induced gap can not be understood in terms of the meanfield picture .",
    "the criticality is best analyzed by the @xmath59-function .",
    "the @xmath59-function describes the flow of a certain controllable parameter ( in our case , @xmath60 ) with respect to the infinitesimal rescaling of the unit of length ; namely , @xmath61 with correlation length @xmath37 .",
    "because the mass gap is the inverse of the correlation length , we obtain , @xmath62 with excitation gap @xmath57 .    as is emphasized in section [ section_2 ] , the gap formula ( [ exponential ] ) is deeply concerned with the criticality at @xmath63 .",
    "the @xmath59-function reflects the universality class of the phase transition .",
    "for instance , as for the exponential singularity such as eq .",
    "( [ exponential ] ) , it behaves like , @xmath64 on the other hand , the conventional second - order transition ( [ power ] ) is characterized by the behavior , @xmath65 in this way , we can read off the critical exponents such as @xmath30 and @xmath66 .    as is presented in the previous subsection , the excitation - gap data @xmath57 are readily available .",
    "remaining task is to perform the numerical derivatives of @xmath67 .",
    "we adopted the `` richardson s deferred approach to the limit '' algorithm in the text book @xcite . in this algorithm",
    ", one takes an extrapolation after calculating various finite - difference differentiations .",
    "we monitored the relative error , and checked that the error is kept within @xmath68 . from these preparations",
    ", we can calculate the @xmath59-function from our simulation data .",
    "we plotted the @xmath59-function @xmath69 in fig .",
    "[ figure_beta_1 ] for @xmath70 .",
    "we see that there appear two regimes : as is indicated in the plot , in the region @xmath71 , the @xmath59-function is best fitted by a power law @xmath72 .",
    "hence , the universality would belong to the exponential singularity ( [ beta_exponential ] ) with exponent @xmath73 .",
    "note that such stretched - exponential behavior is suggested in the previous subsection . on the contrary",
    ", the @xmath59-function falls in the simple behavior @xmath74 with the index @xmath75 for large @xmath55 ; see eq .",
    "( [ beta_power ] ) .",
    "that result tells that for large @xmath55 , the gap formula enters the regime of power law ( [ power ] ) .",
    "that is quite convincing , because for large @xmath55 , @xmath22 becomes irrelevant and the system reduces @xcite to the text - book problem of `` particle in a box . ''",
    "hence , the excitation gap is simply given by the power law ( [ power ] ) with the index @xmath75 .",
    "to summarize , we found that for large @xmath55 , the physics changes so that we must look into the behavior in the vicinity of @xmath76 .    in order to estimate @xmath30 ,",
    "we have presented the log - log plot in fig .",
    "[ figure_beta_2 ] for various @xmath22 . from the slopes",
    ", we obtain an estimate @xmath77 .",
    "this estimate is far less than the mean - field value @xmath3 .",
    "it clearly supports zaanen s claim @xmath26 @xcite that the collision - induced mass gap is governed by the stretched - exponential singularity .",
    "that is , the collision - induced mass gap is far larger than that anticipated from meanfield , and hence , the string is subjected to robust pinning potential due to quantum collisions ; see section [ section_2 ] .",
    "meanwhile , we had also calculated the roomany - wyld approximant of the @xmath59-function @xcite , @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 denote a pair of system sizes .",
    "this approximant , in general , exhibits smaller finite - size collections .",
    "in fact , we found that it converges rapidly to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , the resultant data are identical to those with the aforementioned formula ( [ beta ] ) for sufficiently large @xmath81 . because we take advantage of very large system sizes owing to the density - matrix renormalization group , the approximant formula ( [ rw ] )",
    "is not particularly necessary .",
    "so far , we have extracted the singularity exponent directly from the excitation - gap data . however , as is mentioned in section [ section_2 ] , the mean deviation of the string undulations contains an information of the exponent ; @xmath82    in fig .",
    "[ figure_mean_deviation ] , we plotted the mean fluctuation width @xmath83 for various @xmath1 and @xmath28-@xmath29 . from the plot , we see that there appear two distinctive regimes as in fig .",
    "[ figure_beta_1 ] . for small @xmath1",
    ", @xmath83 is proportional to @xmath1 , as is anticipated from a naive argument ; see section [ section_2 ] .",
    "however , for large @xmath1 , @xmath83 starts to bend down , indicating that the string undulation becomes suppressed .",
    "hence , for large @xmath1 , the conventional picture does not apply .",
    "from the slopes , we read off the exponent @xmath84 .",
    "( this result supports our estimate @xmath85 rather than the meanfield value @xmath3 . ) hence , we see @xmath86 as for @xmath87 . as a consequence",
    ", we found fairly definitely that the string is straightened macroscopically due to the quantum collisions .",
    "this feature is reminiscent of the infrared divergences encountered in the theory by zaanen @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the quantum entropic ( collision induced ) interaction of an elastic string confined between walls ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",

    ", we utilized the @xmath59-function ( [ beta ] ) , which is readily accessible from our simulation data . from the asymptotic form of large @xmath1 , we obtained the estimate @xmath88 for @xmath28-@xmath29 ; see fig .",
    "[ figure_beta_2 ] .",
    "our estimate supports the recent proposal @xcite that @xmath57 is described by the stretched exponential form with @xmath26 , whereas it might conflict with the meanfield value @xmath3 .",
    "it would be noteworthy that the elastic modulus also obeys the stretched exponential , as is shown in our previous study @xcite .",
    "hence , it is established fairly definitely that the excitation gap is also described by the stretched exponential singularity .",
    "namely , the excitation gap is much larger than that anticipated from meanfield .",
    "moreover , we found that the mean fluctuation width @xmath83 is far less than the wall spacing @xmath1 ; namely @xmath89 .",
    "this again supports our conclusion rather than the meanfield ; see eq .",
    "( [ deviation_and_exponent ] ) .    from those observations ,",
    "we are led to the conclusion that the string is confined by extremely robust effective pinning potential due to the quantum collisions ; subsequently , large mass gap opens and @xmath83 gets bounded .",
    "those features are also quite consistent with the findings of the series of works @xcite , validating their `` order out of disorder '' mechanism responsible to the stabilization of the stripe phase .",
    "provided that plural strings are concerned , does the value @xmath30 get affected ? as a matter of fact , the exponent @xmath30 is not necessarily universal , but it does exhibit continuous variation @xcite for a certain class of extended models . more specifically , in refs . , the authors claim that for extended models with high central charges ( that is , many random surfaces ) exhibit various types of criticalities .",
