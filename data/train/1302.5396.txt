    "the dynamics of many real - world , in particular biological , systems exhibits switchlike behavior .",
    "examples include gene regulatory networks , where at any given time a gene may be expressed ( switched on ) or not expressed ( switched off ) and neuronal networks , where at any given time a neuron may or may not fire . mathematical models of such systems can often take the form of a differentiable flow  @xmath0 or a boolean dynamical system  @xmath1 .",
    "the former type of model usually incorporates more relevant details and appears biologically more realistic , while the latter type may be easier to analyze , at least by simulations .",
    "the literature describes a vast number of cases where boolean and other discrete models have been successfully used to make realistic predictions about real - world systems ; for example , several chapters of  @xcite review such success stories in biology .    if the same real - world system can be modeled both as a differentiable flow  @xmath0 and a boolean system  @xmath1 , the question naturally arises how the two models are related to each other .",
    "this question has several distinct aspects , two of which will be discussed in this note : translation between the two types of systems and consistency .",
    "differentiable flows  @xmath0 are induced by odes    @xmath2    while formally different mathematical objects , for convenience we will sometimes refer to the flow  @xmath0 and the ode  ( [ eqn : ode - general ] ) as if they were synonymous .",
    "the state space of a differentiable flow is a subset  @xmath3 of some  @xmath4 , typically a compact manifold .",
    "the state space of an @xmath5-dimensional boolean system is the set  @xmath6 of @xmath5-dimensional boolean vectors  @xmath7 .",
    "the dynamics is given by a boolean function @xmath8 so that    @xmath9    while a boolean system is formally a pair  @xmath10 , the state space is already implied by the updating function  @xmath11 as its domain , so we will sometimes use  @xmath11 itself as shorthand for specifying  @xmath1 .",
    "translating a flow  @xmath0 into a boolean system  @xmath1 requires at the minimum construction of a map @xmath12 that we will call the _ discretization _ of  @xmath3 .",
    "typically , this map is constructed by discretizing the values @xmath13 for  @xmath5 among the variables in  @xmath3 and assigning to them the boolean value  @xmath14 if @xmath13 is below a threshold  @xmath15 and @xmath16 if @xmath13 is above this threshold . in practical applications it may be far from obvious how to choose the thresholds  @xmath15 , see  @xcite , but this issue is beyond the scope of this note .",
    "we want to point out though that not all variables in  @xmath3 need to be discretized .",
    "for example , in models of gene regulation one may choose to incorporate only discretized values of mrna concentrations but not of their translated proteins into the boolean model .",
    "similarly , the boolean models constructed in  @xcite have only one boolean variable per neuron , while the state of each each neuron in the ode model is characterized both by the cross - membrane voltage and a second , so - called gating variable .    translating the odes  ( [ eqn : ode - general ] ) into a boolean updating function",
    "@xmath11 is less straightforward than discretizing some variables , except in special cases when we have _ strong consistency _ ( see section  [ sec : consistency ] ) , or when @xmath11 itself is inherent in the construction of  @xmath0 . in practice ,",
    "the updating functions of boolean models are usually based directly on the available empirical knowledge of the real - world system .",
    "fortunately , for the results reported here , it does not matter how  @xmath11 is constructed .",
    "therefore we will here somewhat informally assume that a given flow @xmath0 has been translated into a boolean system  @xmath1 by means of a discretization  @xmath17 and some unspecified `` natural '' choice of  @xmath11 and call the resulting @xmath1 a _ ( natural ) boolean approximation of  @xmath0 .",
    "_ we need to emphasize though that our usage of these phrases does not imply any consistency whatsoever between a given flow and its natural boolean approximation .",
    "wile at least some differentiable flows  @xmath0 have unique natural boolean approximations , translation from boolean into ode systems can not be a one - to - one procedure .",
    "however , for some types of real - world systems we may have a fairly good idea about a general class of ode models that give a reasonably good description of the underlying mechanisms .",
    "being able to identify a subset or a single representative of this class that will have a given boolean system as its approximation can be a powerful tool for model selection in cases where the available data allow for construction of boolean models .",
    "the caveats about non - uniqueness nonwithstanding , we like to think about this process as translating boolean into ode models",
    ".    for example , _ glass networks _ are an extensively studied class of simple ode models for gene regulatory networks  @xcite , @xcite@xcite . in these networks ,",
    "the concentration @xmath13 of the @xmath18-th mrna ( or gene product , if one prefers to think about them this way ) is modeled by a de    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is a piecewise constant ( usually discontinuous ) production term and @xmath21 is the decay term . under certain technical assumptions",
    "a glass network has a natural boolean approximation .    similarly ,",
    "@xcite constructed a class of excitatory - inhibitory neuronal networks whose ode models have natural boolean approximations and showed that every boolean system can be translated into a model in this class . together with the theorem about consistency that was proved in  @xcite , this makes both the continuous and discrete dynamical systems promising candidates for modeling actual neuronal networks that exhibit a phenomenon called _ dynamic clustering . _ as in glass networks , some odes of  @xcite have right - hand sides with discontinuities .",
    "here we introduce two other classes of differentiable flows with natural boolean approximations so that every boolean system can be translated into a set of flows in each class .",
    "these classes are very broad , relatively easy to study , and the odes in our classes have lipschitz - continuous right - hand sides . while these classes are not directly related to any applications that we are aware of , we believe they provide a convenient set of toy models for exploring the relation between differentiable flows and their boolean approximations , such as conditions for consistency . in particular , the study of these classes may allow us to identify which type results about glass networks or from  @xcite do require discontinuities in the right - hand sides of the odes , such as in  ( [ eqn : glassodes ] ) , and which ones do not .",
    "if a flow @xmath0 and a boolean system @xmath1 are to function as useful models of the same real - world system , they should be _ consistent _ in the sense that they make equivalent predictions .",
    "in particular , we would like to assure that for all trajectories of  @xmath0 that start in a sufficiently large subset  @xmath22 of  @xmath3 the next boolean state of the system will be what @xmath11 , or at least one of the coordinates of  @xmath11 , predicts for the current boolean state @xmath23 . while quite intuitive , this notion is not easy to formalize ; in fact , it admits a number of nonequivalent formal definitions that seem plausible .",
    "the choice of the most appropriate one may depend on the context ( see section  [ sec : discussion ] for a brief discussion of one example ) .",
    "the problem is that while each state @xmath24 of  @xmath1 has a well - defined successor state @xmath25 , time in the flow  @xmath0 increases continuously and one has to pick a time @xmath26 for which @xmath27 will be considered the `` next '' boolean state after time  @xmath28 . here",
    "we will study two such formal and quite natural notions ; we call them _ strong consistency _ and _ consistency .",
    "_      in section  [ sec : translation ] we will describe methods for translating , in the sense of subsection  [ subsec : translation ] , a boolean system @xmath10 into differentiable flows @xmath29 and @xmath30 with state spaces  @xmath31 and  @xmath32 respectively , where @xmath33 will be a certain compact interval .",
    "each real variable in systems  @xmath29 will correspond to a separate boolean variable ; while for systems  @xmath30 only the variables  @xmath13 for @xmath34 will have boolean discretizations .",
    "we call these variables the _ signature variables _ as they determine the boolean state of the flow . each signature variable  @xmath13 receives input only from @xmath35 whereas @xmath35 receives input only from the signature variables @xmath36",
    ".    one can think about the systems  @xmath30 as describing the dynamics of _ agents _ @xmath37 whose internal states are represented by the @xmath13s and who receive signals about the state of the system as a whole through @xmath35 .",
    "thus we will refer to the variables  @xmath35 as the _ signaling variables .",
    "the parameter  @xmath38 will allow us to control the degree of separation of time scales between variables of the flows ; in particular , between the dynamics of the signature variables and the signaling variables .",
    "let us mention that @xmath29 and @xmath30 also depend on another parameter  @xmath39 that can be thought of as the particular translation method or _ conversion scheme .",
    "_ most of our results allow a lot of flexibility in the choice of  @xmath39 but assume  @xmath39 fixed ; therefore we will often suppress this parameter in our notation .    in section  [ sec : consistency ]",
    "we formally define the notions of strong consistency and consistency . in section  [ sec : boolean ] we define the two important classes of one - stepping and monotone - stepping boolean systems and show that strong consistency is possible only if the boolean system is one - stepping . in section  [ sec : examples ] we give some examples of ( strong ) consistency or lack thereof for very simple boolean systems . in section  [ sec : consistency - stepping ]",
    "we prove the two main results of this paper , namely that sufficient separation of time scales guarantees strong consistency of  @xmath30 with  @xmath11 for one - stepping  @xmath11 and consistency of  @xmath30 with  @xmath11 for monotone - stepping  @xmath11 . in section",

    "let us make the observation more precise in the following way : consider type  ii episodes as above and let @xmath466 be such that @xmath467 for all  @xmath57 \\backslash i$ ] and @xmath468 for all  @xmath200 . then @xmath469 . if @xmath470 , then @xmath466 is monotone and @xmath471 , @xmath472 . in this case , after completion of these type  ii episodes , the system will have entered a state in  @xmath473 , and the next type  i episode starts .",
    "this alternation of type  i and type  ii episodes will continue until all variables @xmath13 with @xmath409 have crossed the interval @xmath413 $ ] , exactly once , assuming the value  @xmath161 at exactly one time along the way , which implies  ( c ) .",
    "moreover , all variables @xmath13 with  @xmath407 will stay in  @xmath474 $ ] , which implies  ( b ) .",
    "eventually , after completing the last type  ii episode , the system will reach a state @xmath475 where @xmath476 .",
    "such time @xmath477 will mark the onset of a _",
    "type  iii episode .",
    "_ we need only to show that under sufficient separation of time scales during a type  iii episode the trajectory will move from  @xmath478 into @xmath479 while staying inside @xmath480 .",
    "this will imply  ( a ) without violating  ( b ) or  ( c ) and complete the proof of the theorem .",
    "we will not need to assume that @xmath481 is monotone , but we still need to consider the set @xmath482 and show that at some time @xmath483 we have @xmath484 while @xmath485 for all @xmath486 $ ] . notice that at time @xmath487 for each @xmath57 $ ] the variables @xmath100 will be on the same side of  @xmath161 and head in the direction of the locally stable equilibria @xmath398 and @xmath426 . if @xmath488 $ ] then @xmath35 must have entered this interval during a type  ii episode ( after leaving it and releasing  @xmath13 if @xmath409 ) , and can have subsequently moved deeper into this interval only during some of the type  ii episodes when we did nt have control over  @xmath129 .",
    "thus by  ( [ eqn : derivest - upper ] ) the distance of @xmath35 from the nearest endpoint of this interval can be at most @xmath489 , where @xmath251 denotes the combined duration of all type  ii episodes since time @xmath490 . by  ( [ eqn : xi - reachtime ] )",
    ", we can estimate    @xmath491    on the other hand , while @xmath485 , by  ( [ eqn : q - reflects - boolean ] ) and the shape of  @xmath85 we have    @xmath492    let @xmath493 .",

    "but the trajectory can leave  @xmath480 only after some @xmath442 has crossed over to the other side of the interval @xmath496 $ ] , which in view of  ( [ eqn : derivest - upper ] ) takes at least  @xmath497 time units . since we assumed that @xmath369 , we have @xmath498 , and it follows from the choice of  @xmath341 in  ( [ eqn : mufirst ] ) that @xmath46 will stay inside @xmath480 during the time interval  @xmath495 $ ] as long as @xmath338 for all  @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "@xmath216    let us remark that we may see consistency even in systems that are not monotone - stepping ; subsection  [ subsec : quasipersec ] gives an example .",
    "in this example , the flow @xmath499 is a direct product of two flows with one - stepping boolean approximations whose variables do nt interact .",
    "theorem  [ thm : mainth ] clearly applies to to each factor and thus generalizes to direct products of monotone - stepping systems .",
    "it remains an open problem to find the most general assumptions under which the conclusion of theorem  [ thm : mainth ] holds .",
    "the literature contains a few results on consistency between differentiable flows and boolean systems ; here we discuss how these are related to our theorem  [ thm : mainth ] .",
    "the best - known examples are the results for glass networks .",
    "these models were developed by glass in  @xcite@xcite based on earlier work on similar models by glass and kauffman  @xcite .",
    "the paper  @xcite gives a review of the major results and a unifying approach to the extensive literature on these networks .",
    "for suitable choices of the functions  @xmath20 and decay constants @xmath500 in  ( [ eqn : glassodes ] ) , the resulting flows are consistent with their boolean approximations . consistency becomes problematic though in the presence of _ self - regulation , _ that is , if @xmath20 depends on  @xmath13 . as our work in subsection",
    "[ subsec : copy - negation ] shows , similar problems may occur in our systems  @xmath29 . while the results about consistency in glass networks do not require an assumption of monotone - stepping trajectories , corollary  [ corol : strong - implies - onestep ] applies and strong consistency does require one - stepping boolean trajectories .",
    "in contrast , terman _",
    "@xcite constructed a class of excitatory - inhibitory neuronal networks whose ode models have natural boolean approximations and showed that _ every _ boolean system can be translated into a model in this class so that we have a form of strong consistency .",
    "this does not contradict corollary  [ corol : strong - implies - onestep ] because the notion of consistency in  @xcite is different from definition  [ def : consistency ] and seems more appropriate for the dynamics of these networks .",
    "essentially , switches of the boolean states of several variables are treated as simultaneous if they occur within a small time - windows that mark the boundaries between so - called _ episodes .",
    "_ this opens a promising avenue of future research on generalizations of this notion of consistency as well as possible generalizations of theorem  [ thm : mainth ] in this direction .",
    "gehrmann and drossel  @xcite obtained results about consistency between ode models for two small gene regulatory networks and their boolean approximations .",
    "in contrast to glass networks and  @xcite , in these models the right - hand sides of the odes are lipschitz - continuous , as they are in the models studied here .",
    "the systems of  @xcite and our systems  @xmath30 can all be conceptualized as _",
    "networks of interacting agents , _ where the ode variables are grouped into pairwise disjoint sets  @xmath501 that constitute the _",
    "@xmath18-th agent _ and only one boolean variable is assigned to each agent .",
    "roughly speaking , in  @xcite an agent corresponds to a neuron whose state is characterized by a cross - membrane voltage and a so - called gating variable , in  @xcite an agent corresponds to a gene whose state is characterized by its mrna concentration and the concentration of the corresponding gene product , and in  @xmath30 we have @xmath502 .",
    "such a partition into agents appears natural in many models of real - world systems and may favor consistency between an ode system and its boolean approximation .",
    "for example , in our systems  @xmath30 self - regulation does not cause the kind of problems for consistency as it may cause in systems  @xmath29 or glass networks , where all variables are discretized . identifying and perhaps classifying general mechanisms in such networks of interacting agents that favor or guarantee some form of consistency is another promising avenue for further research .",
    "in particular , we are planning to generalize theorem  [ thm : mainth ] to much larger classes of networks of interacting agents .",
    "the mechanism that gives theorem  [ thm : mainth ] of course is sufficient separation of timescales in addition to suitable bifurcations in the internal dynamics of the signature variables , and the theorem should generalize in this form .",
    "the consistency result in  @xcite also relies on separation of time scales , with voltages changing much faster than gating variables , but an additional synchronization mechanism is built into the network architecture .",
    "in contrast to theorem  [ thm : mainth ] , very large separation of time scales destroys the consistency for the first system studied in  @xcite , despite the fact that its boolean approximation is one - stepping .",
    "thus the mechanism for consistency at other time scales that is reported in  @xcite must be different .",
    "there are some similarities between the proof of our theorem  [ thm : mainth ] and the results in  @xcite about certain models of gene regulatory networks with steep sigmoid functions .",
    "in particular , we want to note that in our systems @xmath30 each signaling variable regulates exactly one signature variable has a parallel in assumption  @xmath503 of  @xcite that every transcription factor regulates exactly one gene at each of its thresholds .",
    "it appears , however , that proving analytical results about gene regulation with steep continuous sigmoid function is in general more challenging than proving analogous results for the classes described here ( see  @xcite and references therein for description of some difficulties in the former classes ) .",
    "many boolean systems that have been studied in the literature are one - stepping .",
    "the _ one - input systems _ considered in  @xcite are a special case , we mentioned already  @xcite , and the boolean approximation of the models considered in  @xcite are another example . the latter paper compares various approximations , not only boolean ones , to a complete nonlinear model of gene regulation and reports that substantial discrepancies can arise between the predictions of various models for even such a simple system .",
    "this is another piece of evidence that our models are better behaved than would be expected of models of gene regulation .",
    "chaos in differentiable flows has been widely studied .",
    "a notion of chaos in classes of boolean systems has been proposed by s.  kauffman and has been fairly extensively studied ( see  @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "it is a natural question whether there is any connection between these two notions of chaos in the sense that differentiable flows that can be translated into a chaotic boolean system must be or will tend to be chaotic flows , or _ vice versa .",
    "_ in other words , it is natural to ask whether the two notions of chaos are saying something equivalent about the underlying natural system or whether they are just two different mathematical properties that happen to share a name .",
    "chaos in individual boolean systems can be defined in terms of the _ slope of the derrida curve at the origin , _ that is , the average hamming distance after one updating step for randomly chosen initial states with hamming distance  1 .",
    "if this slope exceeds  1 , the system can be considered chaotic .",
    "it is easy to see that there can not be a straightforward correspondence between chaos in flows and chaos in this sense in their boolean approximations .",
    "for example , the two - dimensional system with  @xmath11 given by    @xmath504 is chaotic in this sense , but the corresponding two - dimensional flow @xmath29 can not exhibit chaos .",
    "it seems quite likely though that there are some more subtle connections between the two notions of chaos or between chaos and consistency .",
    "exploring such connections leads to interesting and quite challenging questions .",
    "for example , it would be interesting to know under what conditions the sets @xmath340 of theorem  [ thm : mainth](ii ) must intersect a unique ( attracting ) periodic orbit , which would preclude chaos in this region of the state space .",
    "this remains an open question even for the one - stepping trajectories of example  [ ex : fixed - vs - onestep](ii ) and the conversion schemes that we presented in subsection  [ subsec : convert - schemes ] .",
    "our software has a module for estimating lyapunov exponents and allows for numerical explorations of such problems .",
    "we constructed , for every boolean system with updating function  @xmath11 , two classes of ode systems @xmath505 for which the boolean system @xmath506 is a natural approximation .",
    "theorem  [ thm : mainth ] shows that sufficiently large separation of time scales guarantees consistency between @xmath99 and @xmath506 on a large region of the state space of the former , as long as  @xmath11 is monotone - stepping .",
    "classes of ode systems that were previously investigated in the literature for consistency with their natural boolean approximations either have discontinuities in their right - hand sides or tend to not satisfy the counterpart of theorem  [ thm : mainth ] in its most general form . in our opinion , this makes the models presented here a promising class of toy models for elucidating general mechanisms that favor or entail consistency between an ode system and its boolean approximation .",
    "it seems likely that the insights from studying such mechanisms in the context of our models would , at least to some extent , carry over to classes of realistic but analytically less tractable models of natural , in particular biological , phenomena .",
