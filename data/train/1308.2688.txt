    "this work on pricing american options under proportional transaction costs goes back to the seminal discovery by @xcite that to hedge against a buyer who can exercise the option at any ( ordinary ) stopping time , the seller must in effect be protected against all mixed ( randomised ) stopping times .",
    "this was followed by @xcite , who established a non - constructive dual representation for the set of strategies superhedging the seller s ( though not the buyer s ) position in an american option under transaction costs .",
    "efficient iterative algorithms for computing the upper and lower hedging prices of the option , the hedging strategies , optimal stopping times as well as dual representations for both the seller and the buyer of an american option under transaction costs were developed by @xcite in a model with two assets , and @xcite in a multi - asset model .",
    "all these approaches take it for granted that the buyer can only exercise the option instantly , at an ordinary stopping time of his choosing .    by contrast , in the present paper we allow the buyer the flexibility to exercise an american option gradually , rather than all at a single time instance . though it would be difficult in practice to exercise a fraction of an option contract and to hold on to the reminder to exercise it later",
    ", the holder of a large portfolio of options may well choose to exercise the individual contracts on different dates if that proves beneficial .",
    "does this ability to exercise gradually affect the pricing bounds , hedging strategies and optimal stopping times for the buyer and/or seller ?",
    "perhaps surprisingly , the answer to this question is yes , it does in the presence of transaction costs .",
    "gradual exercise turns out to be linked to another feature , referred to as deferred solvency , which will also be studied here .",
    "if a temporary loss of liquidity occurs in the market , as reflected by unusually large bid - ask spreads , agents may become insolvent .",
    "being allowed to defer closing their positions until liquidity is restored might enable them to become solvent once again .",
    "this gives more leeway when constructing hedging strategies than the usual requirement that agents should remain solvent at all times .",
    "@xcite was the first to explore the consequences of gradual exercise and deferred solvency using a model with a single risky asset as a testing ground . in the present paper",
    "these ideas are developed in a systematic manner and extended to the much more general setting of the multi - asset market model with transaction costs due to @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "pricing and hedging for the seller of an american option under transaction costs is a convex optimisation problem irrespective of whether instant or gradual exercise is permitted .",
    "however , this is not so for the buyer . in this case one has to tackle a non - convex optimisation problem for options that can only be exercised instantly .",
    "a very interesting consequence of gradual exercise is that pricing and hedging becomes a convex optimisation problem also for the buyer of an american option , making it possible to deploy convex duality methods .",
    "the convexity of the problem also makes it much easier to implement the pricing and hedging algorithms numerically .",
    "we will make use of this new opportunity in this paper .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ sect - multi - curr - mod ] recalls the general setting of kabanov s multi - asset model with transaction costs . in section  [",
    "sect : inst - versus - grad - exe ] the hedging strategies for the buyer and seller and the corresponding option prices under gradual exercise are introduced and compared with the same notions under instant exercise",
    ". a toy example is set up to demonstrate that it is easier to hedge an option and that the bid - ask spread of the option prices can be narrower under gradual exercise as compared to instant exercise . in section  [",
    "sect : seller ] the seller s case is studied in detail .",
    "the notion of deferred solvency is first discussed and linked in proposition  [ prop : am : seller : immediate - ultimate ] with the hedging problem for the seller of an american option with gradual exercise .",
    "the sets of seller s hedging portfolios are then constructed and related to the ask price of the option under gradual exercise and to a construction of a seller s hedging strategy realising the ask price ; see theorem  [ prop : seller : zau0=initial - endowments ] .",
    "a dual representation of the seller s price is established in theorem  [ thm : ask - price - representation ] .",
    "the toy example is revisited to illustrate the various constructions and results for the seller .",
    "section  [ sect : buyer ] is devoted to the buyer s case .",
    "buyer s hedging portfolios and strategies are constructed and used to compute the bid price of the option ; see theorem  [ prop:2012 - 07 - 26:hedging - construct ] .",
    "finally , the dual representation for the buyer is explored in theorem  [ th : bu - buyer ] .",
    "once again , the toy example serves to illustrate the results .",
