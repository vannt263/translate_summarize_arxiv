    "strange stars are stars made of absolutely stable quark matter @xcite .",
    "their existence ( i.e. , the stability of strange quark matter ) depends on poorly constrained strong interaction properties , and remains to be decided by observation or experiment ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "if strange stars are stable , they contain roughly equal numbers of up , down , and strange quarks , but due to the higher mass of the s - quark , they will normally contain a slight deficit of strange quarks with negative charge , and thus have an overall positive quark charge to be compensated by electrons .",
    "even color - flavor locked quark matter , which is electrically neutral in bulk @xcite , has an overall positive quark charge due to surface effects @xcite .",
    "the quark surface of a strange star is very sharp ( the density drops from above nuclear matter density to zero within a few fm ) , and since the electrostatic force is weaker than the strong force , some of the electrons necessary to create an overall charge neutral object will form a thin atmosphere with a huge electric field ( up to @xmath0 v / cm ) outside the quark phase .",
    "this field is capable of sustaining a nuclear matter crust decoupled from the quark phase by an electron - filled gap .",
    "the maximum mass of such a crust is approximately @xmath1 , corresponding to the situation where the inner boundary of the crust reaches the neutron drip density , @xmath2 , where neutrons drip out of crust nuclei and get dissolved in the quark phase .",
    "smaller crust mass limits would occur if the gap is sufficiently narrow to allow direct contact with the crust or if the rate of quantum tunneling of nuclei into the quark core of the star is large .",
    "the crust mass and moment of inertia as well as the coupling between core and crust play important roles in the understanding of strange star properties , and therefore the properties of the gap are very important .",
    "the width of this gap is the main topic of the present investigation .",
    "the properties of the electron atmosphere and the impact on a nuclear matter crust have been studied by many authors , including @xcite .",
    "these studies have involved solutions to the poisson equation for the electrostatic potential with the boundary condition of electric neutrality deep within the strange star , as well as a condition for the potential at large distances . for bare strange stars ,",
    "i.e. , stars without a nuclear crust , the potential goes to zero at infinity . for strange stars accreting nuclear matter on the surface",
    ", the condition has been taken to be a matching of the electric potential from the electrons to the value of the potential required in the bulk of the nuclear matter crust ( typically several mev , depending on the crust density ) .",
    "this leads to a typical gap size ( distance from quark surface to the inner surface of the nuclear crust ) of @xmath3 fm , comparable to the distance over which the potential drops by a factor of a few .",
    "the approaches just described do not account however for the detailed balance between electrical and gravitational forces and pressure in the transition from gap to crust .",
    "the potential and its derivative are taken to be continuous across the crust boundary while gravitational forces and pressure in the crust are assumed insignificant ( though see @xcite for an approximate inclusion of gravity ) . in this work",
    "we expand earlier treatments , investigate the effects of including the newtonian gravitational field , and find the detailed structure of the gap and the transition to the crust .",
    "this leads to more narrow gaps than previously found and thus constrains the density at the base of the crust below the neutron drip density .",
    "as the temperature increases , the additional thermal reservoir of electrons initially widens the gap then narrows it , but even for temperatures as high as @xmath4 k in the gap region this effect is small and the width remains constant up to temperatures in the range @xmath5 k depending on the crust density .",
    "the effective chemical potential of species @xmath6 , @xmath7 , is defined as the change in energy for a unit change in number density of species @xmath6 , while the volume , entropy , and other number densities are kept constant . in a steady state assuming the crust to be isothermal the effective chemical potentials of electrons and nuclei should be constant to avoid migration .",
    "they must therefore be equal to their values at the top of the crust , at radius @xmath8 , where the electric potential is zero and the chemical potentials are equal to the particle masses .",
    "therefore we take the effective chemical potentials for electrons and nuclei to be @xmath9+e\\phi_e(r)\\\\ \\mu_n^{\\text{eff}}=&\\mu_n(r)+ze\\phi_e(r)+m_n\\phi_g(r)=m_n+m_n\\phi_g(r)\\\\              & \\mu_n(r)=m_n+m_n[\\phi_g(r)-\\phi_g(r)]-ze\\phi_e(r ) .",

    "@xmath12 is the electron mass , @xmath13 is the mass of the dominant nucleus at the base of the crust , @xmath14 is its charge , @xmath15 is the electric potential and @xmath16 is the gravitational potential for which we will use the newtonian value to get tractable expressions .",
    "@xmath17 is typically of the order of 20 mev at the strange core surface , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the mass of the strange core .",
    "we note at this point that keeping the effective chemical potentials constant corresponds to hydrostatic equilibrium which may be seen explicitly by taking the gradient of the above expressions and using the zero temperature identity @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the pressure and @xmath23 the number density of the @xmath6th component . @xmath24",
    "the total pressure is @xmath25 so the sum then gives the usual force balance @xmath26 with @xmath27 the charge density and @xmath28 the mass density .",
    "we show later that eq .",
    "is convenient when approximating thin crusts .    to solve for the chemical potentials we take the laplacian of eq .   and use poisson s equation in newtonian gravity to get a system of coupled differential equations in the chemical potentials and their derivatives . with the understanding that the core at @xmath29 is comprised of quarks and electrons",

    "@xcite ) . in these equations",
    "we have used rest mass times number density for the matter density in poissons equation .",
    "this is a very rough approximation for the electrons as they are relativistic except for very thin crusts , but in all the calculations below we will neglect the electron contribution to the density completely by taking @xmath36 .",
    "the densities of electrons and nuclei are found from @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the particle momentum , @xmath39 the statistical weight , @xmath40 the energy and @xmath41 the fermi - dirac distribution . for a cold fermi gas with @xmath42",
    "this gives @xmath43 while for finite temperatures there will be additional thermal electrons and working in the approximation @xmath36 the net electron density ( electrons minus positrons ) will be @xmath44 equations and can thus be transformed into four first order coupled differential equations in the four unknowns @xmath45 . given appropriate boundary conditions at some point  usually either in the charge neutral bulk of the strange star core or at the core surface  the system can be solved to find the structure of the gap and the transition to the crust . in principle",
    "we could extend the model to include the entire crust , but it should be noted that we have not included the interactions between nuclei ( apart from the mean electric potential and gravity ) and that the global properties of the crust should be described using relativistic gravity and a more advanced equation of state  such as the bps equation of state .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to modeling the gap and the lower crust until the point where charge neutrality is achieved .",
    "the density at this point can then be taken as the inner crust density used to parametrize the crust models in e.g. @xcite .",
    "before we get into the detailed numerical models it is worth noticing that a number of illustrative approximate models can be calculated analytically , and that as it turns out these models reproduce the behavior of the system accurately .",
    "first of all it should be noted that we can get a very useful relation from eq .   by taking the sum @xmath46\\label{sum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and its derivative @xmath47 from this and equations ( [ mue ] , [ mun ] ) we can get a qualitative idea of the form of the solutions .",
    "for example we know that just above the strange core surface the electric potential should be large and positive and its gradient should be large and negative while the gravitational potential and its gradient can be approximated by their newtonian values .",
    "only electrons are present at this point so the charge density is negative , and @xmath10 will be large and decreasing rapidly but with a positive curvature .",
    "since the right hand side of equation is almost constant across the gap @xmath11 must increase as @xmath10 decreases .",
    "thus we also see that @xmath10 must decrease monotonically since @xmath10 and @xmath11 would diverge in opposite directions if @xmath10 started increasing while the charge density was still negative and @xmath48 was curving upwards .",
    "once @xmath31 we enter the crust and at some point achieve charge neutrality .",
    "@xmath49 curves downwards only if the charge density is negative and since we expect the crust to be charge neutral in bulk @xmath11 must start decreasing along with @xmath10 at this point for the crust to remain charge neutral .",
    "the right hand side of equation is of the order of @xmath50 so for both @xmath51 and @xmath52 to be negative they must both be numerically smaller than @xmath53 .",
    "since @xmath51 will generally be of the order of @xmath54 close to the surface of the strange star core this places high demands on the numerical procedure as it must be accurate across these many orders of magnitude .",
    "this difficulty stems from the fact that we are trying to model the transition from the gap where the strong electrical force is dominant to a charge neutral crust held down by the much weaker gravitational force  a very stiff set of equations .    to get something more quantitative than these heuristic arguments we will use the approximation @xmath36",
    "this allows us to solve for @xmath10 in the case of a pure electron atmosphere with no crust .",
    "this can then be used to find approximate expressions for the gap width . for more realistic solutions",
    "it should be taken into account that some of the electrons from the crust will spill into the gap shielding the strange star core surface charge and affecting the gap width .",
    "we study the full solutions numerically in a later section , but these are much easier to understand ( and find ) with the insight from the qualitative models below .      for a pure electron atmosphere with @xmath36 we have @xmath55 and in general @xmath56 following @xcite",
    "we define @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the height above the strange core surface . assuming a flat strange core surface eq .   then takes the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",

    "it may be noted that in the limit @xmath64 equation reduces to the expression found by alcock et al .  in @xcite since @xmath65 for @xmath66 @xmath67 a plot of this behavior can be found in fig .",

    "we show the variation with temperature for @xmath68 so from the top @xmath69 for these.,width=321 ]    note that we have included the case @xmath70 . in the models below this",
    "just allows a crust at neutron drip density to remain out of direct contact with the strange core surface making it an illustrative case , though the choice is difficult to realize for non color - flavor locked quark matter equations of state @xcite .",
    "sufficiently thin crusts should not be expected to change the electric potential or the distribution of electrons in the gap from that of a pure electron atmosphere .",
    "we can then use the solution found in the previous subsection and demand that equation is obeyed at the crust boundary . since we are working in the approximation @xmath36 the electronic part of the force balance is simply @xmath71 which is trivially fulfilled since @xmath72 and @xmath73 . for a thin crust",
    "we should be able to ignore the pressure gradient from the nuclei and the remainder of the force balance equation involves only the equilibrium between electrostatic repulsion and gravitational attraction of positively charged nuclei : @xmath74 the number density of nuclei then cancels and the equation simply expresses that each individual nucleus feels a balance between the gravitational attraction from the strange star core and the electrostatic repulsion from the net positive charge below it as described by @xmath75 .",
    "this is the same equation as would be obtained by balancing a single positively charged test particle above the strange star surface . in the case of a cold atmosphere we use the derivative of equation for the electric field which leads to the relation @xmath76 or @xmath77 .",
    "the gap width of very thin crusts is therefore almost macroscopic in size as might be expected since the lower layer does not have to support the bulk of the crust .",
    "if we assume that equation is obeyed identically throughout the entire crust as it should be if the pressure gradient from the nuclei remains negligible we can solve for the potential @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a constant . this potential is a solution to poisson s equation without a source term , @xmath80 showing that the crust is locally charge neutral in this approximation .      in heavy dense crusts",
    "the pressure from the nuclei can not be ignored , and we would need the precise density profile to solve equation .",
    "the crust would still be expected to be charge neutral beyond some point not very far from the crust boundary however , so by assuming charge neutrality and using equation it is possible to estimate @xmath10 at the crust boundary .",

    "the crust boundary is defined by @xmath90 and from equation we then have @xmath91 which can be used with the potential to find the gap width @xmath92 the last equality assumes a crust composed of electrons and @xmath93 nuclei . in this approximation the gap width is very small near neutron drip density , and for a realistic value of @xmath94 it would be impossible for a crust to reach neutron drip density while remaining out of contact with the strange star core . if the more stringent limit of @xmath95 from @xcite for the crust to remain secure against strong interactions with the strange star core is used , the maximum crust density is @xmath96 .",

    "[ artikeltemp ] .",
    "qualitatively we note that changes from the cold case are negligible until temperatures around 1 mev or @xmath106 are reached  that is until the temperature is comparable to @xmath10 in the bulk of the crust . for lower densities",
    "the effect occurs at somewhat lower temperatures , but by then the gap is already very large and the temperature does not really change this .",
    "the bump in the gap size seen at high temperatures can be understood from equations and .",
    "the temperature dependent part of equation shows that @xmath107 and thus @xmath108 will be constant for low temperatures , @xmath109 @xmath110 , and smaller for higher temperatures . since @xmath65 for @xmath111 and @xmath112 for @xmath113 this can produce the bump .",
    "physically the thermal electrons in the crust means that @xmath10 does not have to be as large to reach a certain density , which moves the crust boundary further out , while the thermal electrons in the gap screens the strange star surface charge and reduces the gap .",
    "to solve equations and numerically we employ a shooting method which integrates the equations from the quark core to the point of charge neutrality in the crust using a standard runge - kutta routine .",
    "we then vary @xmath114 at the starting point until equation is fulfilled at charge neutrality so the crust remains charge neutral beyond this point .",
    "equations would seem to produce many more free parameters at the starting point than just @xmath114 , but since @xmath115 at the quark core depends on unknown details of the quark matter equation of state we keep it free and explore the solutions for a wide range of this parameter .",
    "furthermore it was shown in the preceding sections that the quantity @xmath116 is related to the density of the crust in the charge neutral bulk through equations and  and as it turns out these relations are fulfilled for the numerical solutions as well . since @xmath117 may be determined at the starting point by equation this leaves @xmath114 as the only parameter to be determined . with this method",
    "we can thus choose @xmath115 at the starting point ( this corresponds to choosing parameters for the equation of state for the strange matter core ) and a crust  described by its density ( @xmath107 ) and temperature at charge neutrality  and find the solution to equations and describing the transition between the core and crust .",
    "we have so far not specified the exact location of the starting point for the integration because the discussion above does not depend on this , and because the assumption of a color - flavor locked quark core places the starting point at the core surface , whereas for a non color - flavor locked core it should be taken in the charge neutral bulk of the core .",
    "color - flavor locked strange quark matter is charge neutral in bulk because the pairing minimizes the energy for equal quark fermi momenta leading to equal numbers of u- , d- , and s - quarks .",
    "however as discussed in @xcite when surface effects are taken into account there will be a deficit of s - quarks near the surface producing an overall positive surface charge . as shown in @xcite",
    "this gives a coulomb barrier at the surface of the order of @xmath118 .",
    "for color - flavor locked stars we thus take the starting point at the surface of the quark core and find solutions for different values of @xmath119 and different crusts .    in non color - flavor locked",
    "stars the deficit of s - quarks is global and compensated by electrons in the bulk .",
    "the surface charge here arises because some electrons near the surface leave the core and create an atmosphere outside the quark phase .",
    "we therefore take the starting point `` deep '' in the core ( 1000 fm below the surface ; our results are insensitive to this choice ) where we assume charge neutrality , @xmath120 , @xmath121 the chemical potential for the quark charge , @xmath122 , defined by this relation , was explored in eg . @xcite and found to be of the order of @xmath123 .",
    "however the same surface effect which gives rise to the strange quark deficit in color - flavor locked stars will reduce the number of strange quarks further .",
    "we do not explicitly include this effect in our calculations .",
    "the chemical composition of the crust depends on its origin and the accretion history of the strange star .",
    "if the crust was created in the supernova along with the strange star and has not changed since , it will consist of cold catalyzed matter as described by the bps equation of state in @xcite .",
    "if the crust was accreted from a companion star temperatures do not become high enough for the matter to reach the equilibrium described by the bps equation of state .",
    "instead hydrogen is burned at the surface to helium which is in turn burned explosively in x - ray bursts and leaves a layer of heavy ashes at densities exceeding @xmath124 .",
    "the ashes then sink under the weight of accreted matter and under the increasing pressure its composition changes in a series of electron captures until neutron drip sets in .",
    "this process has been investigated by haensel & zdunik , and the chemical composition as a function of density was given in @xcite , assuming that the ashes left by the x - ray bursts are composed of @xmath125fe .",
    "the composition of the x - ray burst ashes is a matter of some debate however , and as it was shown by schatz et al .  in @xcite",
    "that @xmath126-processes in the x - ray bursts may lead to a composition dominated by much heavier nuclei with @xmath127 , haensel & zdunik recently revised the resulting chemical composition in @xcite .",
    "however it was also suggested by schatz et al .",
    "@xcite that the x - ray burst ashes may burn explosively at densities around @xmath128 powering x - ray superbursts in which case photodisintegration will lead to a composition similar to that found in @xcite .    for our purpose",
    "we chose the relevant nucleus from these articles based on the density in the crust at the point of charge neutrality  the transition from gap to crust takes place over just a few fm so there is no reason to assume any other nucleus will play a role . as discussed",

    "[ artikeltrans ]  except the one using the bps chemical composition  will interact with the core at low temperature and are not stable at these densities .",
    "only the bps equation of state is thus able to remain stable at neutron drip density even with @xmath136 mev . for other compositions and lower @xmath137",
    "stable crust densities are lower depending on the temperature , see fig .  [ stabrho ] .",
    "we have performed similar calculations for the case of non color - flavor locked cores ( `` ordinary '' strange stars ) , and the structure of a solution with @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath156 and the hz2003 crust composition is shown in figs .",

    "the quarks and their positive charge vanish , the charge density becomes negative and the field starts decreasing .",
    "the solution from the surface out looks like the color flavor - locked case with @xmath157 .        .",
    "the transition to the crust is shown in fig .",
    "[ ncflsmallstructure].,width=321 ]     and [ ncflstructure].,width=321 ]    we again calculate the dependence of the gap width on density shown in fig .",
    "[ ncflrho ] for @xmath133 and different choices of @xmath158 from left to right .",
    "we only show models using the hz2003 crust composition , since the gap width is in this case so insensitive to the choice of composition that the curves would be indistinguishable .",

    "the gap width is approximated by eq .",
    "using @xmath160 . for a bare strange star we would have @xmath161 @xcite , whereas for dense crusts @xmath162 , but since large gap widths are insensitive to @xmath137 we use @xmath163 in all analytical approximations .    .",
    "the analytical approximation explained in the text assumes @xmath164.,width=321 ]    the temperature dependence of the gap width is explored in fig .",
    "[ ncfltemp ] for the case of @xmath165 with the hz2003 crust composition .",
    "we note that the gap width declines steeply at @xmath166 and reaches zero at @xmath167 in contrast to the color - flavor locked case .",
    "this behavior is caused by the condition of charge neutrality at the starting point in the core ( eq .  ) , which reduces @xmath10 significantly at temperatures comparable to @xmath122 .",
    "other that that we note again the bump in the gap width caused by the condition of charge neutrality in the crust .",
    "the lowering of @xmath10 entirely suppresses the bump at high densities .",
    "the gap width is approximated in fig .",
    "[ ncfltemp ] by eq .   using @xmath168 found from eq .  .",
    "@xmath108 is estimated as before from eq .   and .",
    "the maximum density is taken to be the density at which @xmath169 fm as this is as close to zero gap width as is numerically reasonable  note that variations in the numerical results are significant only at this scale .",
    "the analytical estimate assumes @xmath170.,width=321 ]    the variation of transmission coefficient with density and temperature is shown in fig .",
    "[ ncfltrans ] .",
    "we again note that the bump is suppressed compared to the color - flavor locked case and that only crusts with the bps composition can reach neutron drip before they become unstable against transmission through the coulomb barrier .    .",
    "the kink in the hz1990 and hz2003 dependence corresponds to the assumed transition to a hydrogen crust .",
    "the break even estimate is explained in the text and the analytical approximation is based on eq .   with the hz2003 crust composition at drip density and @xmath163.,width=321 ]",
    "we have expanded the treatment of gaps below strange star crusts to include effects of pressure and gravity on the crust nuclei and found the structure of the transition from gap to crust .",
    "overall our results are as one would expect with a very sharp transition from gap to crust , gap widths ranging from a few fm at densities near neutron drip over a few thousand fm at densities close to the maximum to @xmath171 fm for very thin crusts .",
    "crust densities are consequently limited below neutron drip unless one assumes an extreme coulomb barrier height .",
    "if the gap width must be at least a crust lattice distance ( @xmath172 fm ) and a reasonable value of @xmath173 ( or @xmath174 ) is assumed then the crust density is limited to a few times @xmath175 .",
    "the variation of the gap width with temperature is noteworthy in that it initially increases with temperature which is a qualitatively new feature .",
    "however this increase only takes place at temperatures below 1 mev ( @xmath171 k ) for crust densities which give very small gap widths of the order of 1 fm such as in the case of the hz2003 crust at maximum density in figs .",
    "[ artikeltemp ] and [ artikeltrans ] .",
    "a realistic crust should have a sufficient gap width to be stable against strong interaction with the core , and examples of such crusts could be the hz1990 and bps crusts in figs .",
    "[ artikeltemp ] and [ artikeltrans ] ",
    "the hz1990 crust is almost stable , and lowering the density a little to make it so would not change the dependence on temperature much .",
    "if we apply the criterion in eq .   for crust stability we can find the highest stable density at given temperature and coulomb barrier height , @xmath137 .",
    "numerical results for this are shown in fig .",
    "[ stabrho ] and we see that temperature effects are then not important below @xmath171 k. if we demand at least a crust lattice distance in non accreting systems the crust becomes even more stable against variations in the temperature .",
    "the thermal structure of accreting strange stars was investigated by miralda - escud et al .",
    "@xcite who found temperatures around @xmath4 k at the crust boundary for strange stars accreting @xmath176 to @xmath177 assuming that 10 mev is released per nucleon converted to strange quark matter ( bag constant @xmath178 ) . in this case the gap width would not be affected at all , and one might as well use the zero temperature results .",
    "superbursters however are known to have much higher accretion rates around 0.1 - 0.3 times the eddington accretion rate , @xmath179 , and in a recent investigation page and cumming @xcite found temperatures for such stars in the range @xmath180 k at the crust boundary .",
    "this work was motivated by the difficulties in achieving carbon ignition at observed column depths in superburst models on neutron stars  see cumming et al .",
    "2005 @xcite for a recent review  and it was found that superbursts may ignite at the right column density on strange stars provided that neutrino emission in the core is slower than direct urca which implies that strange quark matter should be a color superconductor . during the superburst itself temperatures in the range @xmath181 k are reached for a few hours @xcite .",
    "this is again too low for significant temperature effects and for stable crusts one may as well use the zero temperature expressions .",
    "the present treatment could be improved by including general relativity instead of newtonian gravity , and by using a less simplistic model for the equation of state for the crust .",
    "such improvements are necessary to calculate the properties of the whole star , but we expect the changes in the gap properties to be minor compared to the results presented here . the same can be said about a more detailed treatment of the quark phase , which has here merely been treated as a source of a given total mass and starting value for the electron chemical potential . however , as pointed out in @xcite , the electric potential in the outer layers of the strange core could be qualitatively different from the behavior assumed here if a mixed phase of quark nuggets and electrons can be realized .",
    "another important oversimplification involves the assumption of a constant pairing gap all the way to the quark core surface in the treatment of quark matter in the cfl - phase .",
    "in fact the pairing gap @xmath182 may be envisaged to vanish within a surface distance of order @xmath183 for gap energies between 100 and 10  mev .",
    "possibly a range of phases appear in the extreme uppermost layers , including the possibility that the very surface resembles the ungapped ordinary quark phase also discussed above .",
    "a detailed treatment of gapped phases near a surface remains to be performed .    in conclusion the results of our expanded treatment",
    ", while quantitatively somewhat different , are qualitatively consistent with previous work in the literature with regards to gap width , transmission coefficient and possible crust densities .",
    "the increase in gap width with temperature is new but significant only at very high temperatures not likely realized .",
    "perhaps the most useful results of the investigation are the various analytical approximations which have been derived and shown to fit the full numerical solutions very well , since these provide better physical insight and can be easily used in models for strange star rotation , glitches , accretion and instabilities .",
