    "the initial conditions for cosmic chemical evolution are of fundamental importance to our understanding of galaxy formation and the process of galactic chemical evolution . these conditions , set by the yields of the first few generations of stars ,",
    "depend on various ( largely unknown ) factors including the form of the primordial stellar initial mass function and the uniformity of the enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( igm ; @xcite ) . in order to pin down the initial conditions of cosmic chemical evolution",
    ", one should seek to understand the origin and relative abundances of the metals in the least chemically evolved systems .",
    "the most metal - poor damped ly@xmath0  systems ( dlas ) , for example , are usually interpreted as distant protogalaxies at an early stage of chemical evolution @xcite . whilst the origin of their metals is still largely unknown , recent hydrodynamical simulations suggest that such systems might have been enriched by just a few supernova events @xcite .",
    "if this is indeed the case , the most metal - poor dlas provide a simple route to study the first stages of chemical enrichment in our universe .    by definition ,",
    "dlas have a neutral hydrogen column density in excess of @xmath6 i  atoms @xmath7 ( @xcite ; see also the review by @xcite ) , which acts to self - shield the gas from the ultraviolet background radiation of quasars ( qsos ) and galaxies @xcite .",
    "this results in the gas having a simple ionization structure subject to negligible corrections for unseen ion stages @xcite , quite unlike the ly@xmath0  forest clouds that trace the low density regions of the igm ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ". the main concerns that limit abundance studies in dlas are line saturation and the possibility that dust may hide some fraction of the metals @xcite .",
    "these concerns are alleviated when the metallicity of the dla is below @xmath8 z@xmath9 , which is also the regime where we expect to uncover the enrichment signature of the earliest generations of stars .",
    "the recent interest in the most metal - poor dlas @xcite complements the ongoing local studies of metal - poor stars in the halo of the milky way @xcite .",
    "these stars are believed to have condensed out of near - pristine gas ( perhaps a metal - poor dla itself ? ) , that was enriched by only a few earlier generations of stars .",
    "thus , the first generation of stars can also be studied through the signature retained in the stellar atmospheres of the most metal - poor stars in the halo of our galaxy . however , unlike the relative ease with which one can measure the abundances of metal - poor dlas , deriving element abundances from the stellar atmospheres of metal - poor stars is not straightforward @xcite .",
    "systematic uncertainties in the derived abundances are introduced by assuming that the spectral line being examined forms in a region that is in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , as well as the need to account for three - dimensional ( 3d ) effects in the 1d stellar atmosphere models .",
    "these effects are particularly acute for oxygen , where several different abundance indicators are known to produce contradictory estimates in the low - metallicity regime @xcite . despite the efforts of many authors ,",
    "our uncertainty in the derived oxygen abundances has sparked an ongoing debate as to the trend of [ o / fe ] @xmath10 , where @xmath11 refers to the number of atoms in element a and b. ] in the milky way when [ fe / h ] @xmath12 .",
    "a history of the relevant discussion on [ o / fe ] is provided by @xcite , with further details given in section  [ sec : ofe ] . in brief , at low metallicity , both o and fe are produced exclusively by type - ii supernovae ( sne ii ) and the winds from their progenitors .",
    "when [ fe / h ] @xmath13 , there is a drop in [ o / fe ] due to the _ delayed _ contribution of fe from type - ia supernovae ( sne ia ) .",
    "thus , the [ o / fe ] ratio is most commonly used to measure the time delay between sne ii and the onset of sne ia . at the lowest metallicity , however , one can use the [ o / fe ] ratio as a measure of the relative production of @xmath0- to fe - peak elements by the first few generations of massive stars .",
    "another key diagnostic ratio at low metallicity that may shed light on the nature of the early generations of stars was uncovered by @xcite who reported a rather surprising evolution of [ c / o ] with decreasing o abundance in their sample of 34 halo stars ( see also @xcite ) . in disc and halo stars when the oxygen abundance is @xmath13 , [ c / o ] steadily rises from [ c / o ] @xmath14 to solar .",
    "when [ o / h ] @xmath15 , galactic chemical evolution models that _ only _ consider the nucleosynthetic products of population ii stars predict [ c / o ] to decrease or plateau , contrary to the observed trend .",
    "the increase in [ c / o ] with decreasing metallicity has thus been interpreted as evidence for an increased carbon yield from either population iii stars @xcite or rapidly - rotating low - metallicity population ii stars @xcite . at first",
    ", concerns were raised regarding the accuracy of the derived c and o abundances , since the lines used are subject to large non - lte corrections .",
    "@xcite , however , performed a non - lte analysis of the same lines , with further contraints from additional ci  lines , to confirm the reality of the stellar [ c / o ] trend .",
    "these results depend somewhat on the adopted cross sections for collisions of ci   and oi  atoms with electrons and hydrogen atoms , but for all probable values , [ c / o ] increases with decreasing metallicity when [ o / h ] @xmath16 .    to summarize , at present there are still some remaining concerns that prevent us from accurately measuring c and o abundances in the atmospheres of metal - poor halo stars .",
    "these difficulties have prompted a few teams to focus on very metal - poor @xmath17 , in line with the classification scheme for stars proposed by @xcite . ] ( vmp ) dlas where the absorption lines of cii  and oi   may be unsaturated and the abundances of c and o can be measured with confidence .",
    "unfortunately , these near - pristine dlas are rare , falling in the tail of the metallicity distribution function of dlas @xcite .",
    "thus , only a handful of confirmed vmp dlas are known at present . the first high spectral resolution survey ( @xmath18 , full width at half maximum , fwhm@xmath19 km s@xmath20 ) for vmp dlas was conducted by @xcite , whose specific goal was to study the relative abundances of the cno group of elements as a probe of early nucleosynthesis .",
    "indeed , this was the first study to independently confirm the increased [ c / o ] abundance at low metallicity , suggesting that near - solar values of [ c / o ] are commonplace in this metallicity regime .",
    "the [ c / o ] trend reported by @xcite has also been independently noted by @xcite in a medium spectral resolution ( @xmath21 , fwhm@xmath22 km s@xmath20 ) survey of 35 dlas ( a preliminary report of this study can be found in @xcite ) . in many of their systems ,",
    "the cii  and oi  lines were thought to be affected by line saturation , leaving only five dlas to test the trend in c / o .",
    "interestingly , this sample of dlas suggests that [ c / o ] continues to rise to _ supersolar _ values when [ o / h]@xmath23 ."
