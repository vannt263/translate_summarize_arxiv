    "over the last few years , research on low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) convolutional codes @xcite , also known as spatially coupled ldpc ( sc - ldpc ) codes @xcite , has become very popular .",
    "it is proved that for these codes , the belief propagation ( bp ) decoder can achieve the threshold of the maximum - a - posteriori ( map ) decoder @xcite .",
    "this remarkable phenomenon is known as threshold saturation .",
    "spatial coupling is a general concept that is not limited to ldpc codes .",
    "recently , spatially coupled turbo - like codes ( sc - tcs ) were introduced in @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the spatial coupling of the four main classes of tcs was considered .",
    "these included parallel concatenated codes ( pccs ) @xcite , serially concatenated codes ( sccs ) @xcite , braided convolutional codes ( bccs)@xcite , and hybrid concatenated codes ( hccs ) @xcite .",
    "the density evolution ( de ) analysis performed in @xcite suggests that sc - tcs have an excellent asymptotic behavior and for them , threshold saturation occurs .",
    "this gives a new perspective in designing a concatenated coding scheme : optimizing the uncoupled ensembles for achieving the best bp threshold may not necessarily lead to the best overall performance .",
    "tcs are adopted in many communication standards .",
    "each class of tcs exhibits a unique asymptotic behavior .",
    "while some classes  such as pccs  yield good bp thresholds some others  such as sccs and bccs  have excellent map thresholds .",
    "as shown in @xcite , spatial coupling improves the thresholds of the tc classes .",
    "so far , the different classes of tcs have been considered separately . a unified ensemble which contains all main tc ensembles",
    "can unify the frameworks for analysis , and clarify the connections between the tc classes .",
    "in fact , this ensemble can lead to a better understanding of the similarities and differences between various tc classes and the possible trade - offs in the code design . in @xcite",
    ", the authors introduced an ensemble which unifies pccs and sccs .",
    "this ensemble is based on concatenations of several component encoders and does not cover the bcc and hcc ensembles . in this paper ,",
    "we introduce an ensemble of concatenated convolutional codes that encompasses all the above - mentioned four major classes of tcs . for simplicity",

    "this class of codes is covered by the proposed ensemble if the component code in the equivalent pcc ensemble is set as an accumulator . in order to find a self - concatenated equivalent for the other classes of tcs",
    ", some feedback path has to be introduced in the encoder structure .",
    "the differences between the various original tc ensembles are then reflected in the permutation structure and the amount of feedback in the unified ensemble .",
    "we also derive the exact density evolution equations for the binary erasure channel ( bec ) . using these equations ,",
    "we compute the bp thresholds of the corresponding classes of tcs and we show that the obtained thresholds are very close to the thresholds of the original ensembles .",
    "in this section , for each class of tcs , we separately describe how to reduce the number of component codes in order to obtain the equivalent self - concatenated ensemble .",
