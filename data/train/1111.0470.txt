    "the superconducting transition of the @xmath34 sample is wide .",

    "therefore , it is important to understand the behavior of @xmath78 near @xmath6 .",

    "this finding rules out the possibility that the knee observed in our c - needle measurements at fields lower than 10  oe are due to a lock - in unlock - in transition of flux lines @xcite .",

    "put differently , if a c - needle could be polished into a long oval object without cleaving it , then the knee should have disappeared .     as a function of temperature measured on ( a ) 15% a - needle ( b ) 15% c - needle ( c ) 7% c - needle.,width=264 ]    also , we investigate the impact of the sample geometry on the magnetization . our motivation is to change the needle s dimensions in terms of length - to - width ratio while maintaining needle - like aspect ratio . in fig .",
    "[ fig : size15 ] , we present a multitude of @xmath43 measurements for a- and c - needles .",
    "the inset is a zoom close to @xmath6 .",
    "the details of the magnetization curve are shape - dependent .",
    "however , the @xmath86  mm@xmath19 and @xmath18  mm@xmath19 a - needles have the same curve , demonstrating that the length - to - width ratio is the most significant parameter . the closer the samples are to an ideal needle - like form , the larger the difference in the magnetization between directions .",
    "this , of course , is expected since for a cubic or a spherical geometry , field lines cross the planes at an angle thus mixing the two susceptibilities leading to indistinguishable susceptibilities close to @xmath6 @xcite .        similar data for the 7% samples are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : size7 ] .",
    "however , the 7% sample are not ideal for testing the impact of geometry on the magnetization .",
    "each sample presented in the figure is cut from a different segment of the rod , which are a few centimeters apart .",
    "since 7% doping is on the edge of the superconducting dome , small changes in the preparation conditions may lead to a severely different behavior , such as @xmath6 variations of @xmath87  k ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : srtest ] ) .",
    "consequently , in fig .",

    "for example , the knee and the exact values of the critical temperatures .",
    "nevertheless : ( i ) the order of temperatures @xmath89 which is the main focus of this work is maintained , and ( ii ) the value of the susceptibility at the crossing point is @xmath90 of the saturation value , similar to the first 7% sample .",
    "( b).,width=264 ]    all these tests support our observation that the magnetization of the a- and c - needle are fundamentally different by an amount larger than any possible experimental error .",
    "one might try to explain these differences as a finite size effect , namely , as the penetration depth diverges when @xmath91 , it might have different values for each of the two different directions .",
    "our magnetometer detects a diamagnetic signal only when the penetration depth is similar to the sample width .",
    "this could occur at different temperatures , which also differ from @xmath42 .    to address this possibility",

    "the analysis is valid only far from magnetic saturation .",
    "two arrows show the temperature where @xmath78 is on the order of our measurement field ( @xmath119 oe ) .",
    "[ london ] is valid at temperatures lower than indicated by the arrows .",
