    "molecular clouds are observed to have complex morphology existing on a wide range of scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and exhibit numerous clumpy and filamentary structures .",
    "they are the birthplaces of stars , and the observed distribution of young stellar objects ( ysos ) also yields a wide range of object densities .",
    "the ysos are measured to be anywhere from loosely clustered to highly clustered @xcite .",
    "many molecular cloud maps do however reveal an interesting pattern of dark clouds within which parsec - scale clusters are being formed .",
    "the dark clouds are often themselves separated by several pc .",
    "even the taurus molecular cloud , often associated with so - called `` isolated '' star formation , demonstrates several dark clouds @xcite of pc - scale and masses @xmath0  m@xmath1 that are separated by several pc , each containing embedded weak clusters of ysos .",
    "it was suggested long ago that the dark clouds within a molecular cloud complex may be the result of some early fragmentation process @xcite , and subsequently the suggestion was made that the fragmentation _ within _ the dark clouds may be controlled by the local jeans length @xcite .",
    "based on the observed morphology of clustering within parsec - scale clouds , there is indeed a case to be made for a _ two - stage fragmentation _ process .",
    "the fragmentation within the dark clouds also shows a possible scaling with jeans length , e.g. , the typical separation between cores in the taurus dark clouds is 0.25 pc , consistent with the jeans length corresponding to a column density associated with the visual extinction @xmath2 .",
    "the question then arises as to what controls the fragmentation process at the parsec scale , leading to the formation of individual dark clouds within a molecular cloud complex .",
    "since these regions have nonthermal line widths , the mechanism of turbulent fragmentation , in which turbulence plays a dominant role , is often invoked @xcite .",
    "however , turbulent fragmentation models make no unique prediction for any observed molecular cloud .",
    "the usual technique of running simulations with power spectra of the form @xmath3 , with @xmath4 , means that much of the power is contained in the largest scale of the simulation , leading to the largest structures forming on the chosen size scale of the simulation region . in this paper",
    ", we look for an explanation for large initial fragmentation scales that does not depend on the scale of the modeled system .",
    "we employ a linear analysis that assumes a uniform background state , so it does suffer from the standard `` jeans swindle '' that is well known in the nonmagnetic analysis .",
    "we apply the analysis results using thermal line widths , without using the ansatz of replacing the isothermal sound speed with a nonthermal line width .",
    "we are in effect assuming that the fragmentation of a diffuse cloud is occurring in the dense midplane that has thermal line widths , while an extended diffuse envelope can have nonthermal line widths",
    ". such a picture is consistent with the modeling of the propagation of turbulent motions in a stratified cloud by @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out linear analysis of gravitational instability in a flattened layer that is partially ionized and threaded by a magnetic field that is initially perpendicular to the sheet .",
    "this is based on earlier work by @xcite .",
    "the results show a dramatic dependence of the preferred scale of fragmentation upon the ambient mass - to - flux ratio , if this ratio is close to the critical value .",
    "the time scale for growth of the instability also exhibits a dramatic change around the critical mass - to - flux ratio , with a step - like drop in value as the mass - to - flux ratio goes from slightly subcritical to slightly supercritical .",
    "the time scale of growth of gravitational instability in the subcritical case is commonly referred to in the literature as the `` ambipolar diffusion time '' . a linear analysis of an infinite uniform medium with partial ionization and allowing for ambipolar diffusion has also been performed by @xcite and recently more comprehensively by @xcite .",
    "@xcite have also used this linear analysis to generate a core mass function to fit the one observed in orion . in this paper , we incorporate the new theoretical results from @xcite regarding the fragmentation of partially ionized and magnetized gas , focusing on the fragmentation of a flattened layer , as might be an expected early configuration if the magnetic field strength is significant , or if a cloud is formed by large scale flows . furthermore , structured objects like sheets or filaments exhibit a preferred scale of fragmentation , unlike uniform media , for which the largest scale always has the greatest growth rate . in a sheet - like situation , initial small - amplitude white noise perturbations result in the preferred scale ( possessing the minimum growth time in a linear analysis ) eventually growing to dominate the nonlinear evolution @xcite .",
    "another dramatic variation of the ambipolar diffusion time scale in a molecular cloud will occur because of the strong dependence of ionization fraction on column density of a molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "the ionization fraction can drop in a step - like manner as the column density of a cloud increases beyond a threshold value .",
    "the long ambipolar diffusion time scale in the uv - ionized region has been invoked as the reason for the relatively low galactic star formation rate @xcite , and the transition to lower ionization due to cosmic rays has been invoked as a reason for lower turbulence in high column density regions @xcite .",
    "the effect of this drop in ionization upon the fragmentation process itself has not previously been investigated .",
    "based on the above findings , one can envision two dramatic events during the assemblage of a molecular cloud .",
    "if we assume that a molecular cloud is assembled from hi cloud material that is generally subcritical @xcite and ionized by uv starlight , then a cloud may resist fragmentation ( due to the very long ambipolar diffusion time ) until flows primarily along the magnetic field lines raise the mass - to - flux ratio to slightly above the critical value .",
    "at this point , the transcritical ( but still uv ionized ) cloud may form large fragments as predicted by the linear theory . as these fragments develop , they will also become more supercritical , since their evolution is partially driven by neutral - ion drift . once the column density in the fragments also crosses the column density threshold for the transition to cosmic ray dominated ionization , the fragmentation length and time scales will drop dramatically , and a second stage of fragmentation may be possible .",
    "this is the scenario that we investigate in this paper , by combining results of linear analysis and ionization balance .    in section 2",
    "we outline our model and revisit the linear analysis @xcite with a specific focus on our chosen model parameters . in section 3 , we use the linear analysis results to discuss the feasibility of core formation by subclumps forming within a larger contracting diffuse clump . we do this by comparing numbers from the model with core and clump length scales from observed star - forming regions .",
    "a further discussion is given in section 4 and a summary is presented in section 5 .",
    "we consider clump / core collapse within partially ionized , isothermal , magnetic interstellar molecular clouds .",
    "these clouds are modeled as a planar sheet with infinite extent in the @xmath5- and @xmath6-directions and a local vertical half - thickness @xmath7 .",
    "the nonaxisymetric equations and formulations of our model have been described in detail in several papers @xcite . the volume density ( @xmath8 )",
    "is calculated from the vertical pressure balance equation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the external pressure on the sheet , @xmath11 is the initial uniform column density of the sheet and @xmath12 is the isothermal sound speed ; @xmath13 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath14 is the temperature in kelvins and @xmath15 is the mean mass of a neutral particle ( @xmath16  amu ) .",
    "the evolution equations also include the effect of ambipolar diffusion , which is a measure of the coupling of the neutrals with the ions , and by extension the magnetic field .",
    "this is quantified by the time scale for collisions between neutrals and ions : @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the ion mass , and @xmath19 is the neutral - ion collision rate . the typical atomic and molecular species within a molecular cloud are singly ionized na , mg and hco , which have a mass of 25 amu . assuming collisions between h@xmath20 and hco@xmath21 , the neutral - ion collision rate is @xmath22 @xmath23 s@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "these collisions transfer information about the magnetic field to the neutral particles via the ions that are bound to the field lines .",
    "the threshold for whether a region of a molecular cloud is stable or unstable to collapse is given by the normalized mass - to - flux ratio of the background reference state , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the critical mass - to - flux ratio for gravitational collapse in the adopted model @xcite and @xmath27 is the magnetic field strength of the background reference state",
    ". regions with @xmath28 are defined as subcritical , regions with @xmath29 are defined to be supercritical , and regions with @xmath30 are transcritical . in the limit of flux freezing , the time scale for collisions ( @xmath31 ) is zero , implying frequent collisions between the neutral particles and ions , which therefore couples the neutrals to the magnetic field . under these conditions ,",
    "subcritical regions are supported by the magnetic field and only supercritical regions can collapse .",
    "for nonzero values of @xmath31 , a finite time scale for collisions between neutral particles and ions exists which is inversely dependent on the ion density .",
    "the variation in ion density within a cloud is linked to the type of ionizing radiation available at different depths within the cloud .",
    "this is shown in figure 1 of @xcite . at low extinction ,",
    "i.e. , on the edge of the cloud , the ionization fraction is large , and declines steeply beyond a threshold column density due to shielding of the inner regions from the uv radiation that ionizes the outer layers .",
    "ionization within these inner regions is predominantly due to cosmic rays .",
    "ambipolar diffusion , i.e. , neutral - ion slip , can lead to redistribution of mass relative to magnetic flux within a molecular cloud and cause gravitationally unstable regions to develop within subcritical regions .",
    "these regions then have the chance to collapse .",
    "the model we use is characterized by several dimensionless free parameters .",
    "these include a dimensionless form of the initial neutral - ion collision time ( @xmath32 ) and a dimensionless external pressure ( @xmath33 ) , in addition to the dimensionless mass - to - flux ratio @xmath34 that was introduced earlier .",
    "we normalize column densities by @xmath11 , length scales by @xmath35 and time scales by @xmath36 .",
    "based on these parameters , typical values of the units used and other derived quantities are    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the initial neutral number density and @xmath39 the ionization fraction .",
    "note that @xmath40 is inversely proportional to @xmath39 for a fixed @xmath11 . for our analysis",
    ", we assume a dimensionless external pressure @xmath41 and a temperature @xmath42 k.      +                      assuming the unperturbed zero - order or background state of the model is static and uniform , the magnetohydrodynamic equations for a thin sheet ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the curves show that the subcritical regime has a finite growth time scale for instabilities .",
    "the magnitude of this time scale depends on the degree of ambipolar diffusion , i.e. , the time scale for neutral - ion collisions .",
    "for short neutral - ion collision times ( @xmath91 ) , the time scale for collapse of a subcritical region is 10  -  50 times longer than that of a supercritical region ; frequent collisions between the neutrals and ions will slow the redistribution of matter across the field lines .",
    "this is the origin of the often quoted result that the ambipolar diffusion time is @xmath92  10 times the free - fall time . as the neutral - ion collision time increases ( i.e. , @xmath93 ) , the time between collisions increases to a point that neutrals rarely / never collide with an ion , and therefore have no knowledge of the magnetic field present in the molecular cloud .",
    "in this case , the time scale for collapse of the subcritical regions approaches that of thermal collapse ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : vsmu ] shows the wavelength with minimum growth time , @xmath94 , as a function of @xmath34 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are several features of this graph that are worth noting here . in the flux - frozen case , as the mass - to - flux ratio approaches the critical value ( @xmath95 ) the wavelength with the minimum growth time approaches infinity . for a non - zero neutral - ion collision time",

    "this results in a peak in the region of @xmath96 .",
    "note that the location of this peak changes , becoming slightly more supercritical as the neutral - ion collision time increases .",
    "an alternate way to look at this data is to plot the minimum growth time and length scales as a function of the neutral ion - collision time for a constant mass - to - flux ratio .",

    "the panels show the minimum time scale for collapse ( @xmath97 , left ) and corresponding wavelength ( @xmath94 , right ) as a function of the dimensionless neutral - ion collision time ( @xmath77 ) for the five cases of the initial mass - to - flux ratio ( @xmath34 ) displayed in figure  [ fig : taulambda ] .",
    "focusing on the left panel first , for @xmath98 , the growth time decreases linearly until the neutral - ion collision time reaches unity , after which they asymptote to the thermal collapse time .",
    "conversely , for @xmath99 , there is a plateau for highly ionized regions where the collapse time is longer while for low ionization fractions the collapse time is again the thermal collapse time . for large enough values of @xmath34 ,",
    "the gravitational effects outweigh the magnetic effects and the cloud will just collapse on the thermal time scale . moving to the right panel , the general trends shown by all curves indicate that the wavelength with the minimum growth time is a maximum for short neutral - ion collision times and a minimum for long neutral - ion collision times . for regions with high ionization fractions ( @xmath100 ) , as @xmath34 increases",
    ", the wavelength increases from the thermal wavelength ( @xmath101 ) to a maximum at @xmath102 , and then decreases back to the thermal wavelength as @xmath34 rises further ( see figure  [ fig : vsmu ] ) . on the other extreme , for low ionization fractions",
    ", the variation between the different mass - to - flux ratios is almost indistinguishable since the neutrals are poorly coupled to the ions and the magnetic field .",
    "note however , that for intermediate values of neutral - ion collision times , @xmath103 , the preferred wavelength for @xmath99 becomes larger than those for @xmath104 and @xmath102 .",
    "this is a result of the complex interplay between ambipolar diffusion and field - line dragging in this hybrid regime of moderate coupling .",
    "observational studies of star forming regions have shown that there are several different extinction thresholds which define the state of a molecular cloud .",
    "@xcite identify a threshold of @xmath105 whereby above this value clumps within the rosette molecular cloud are believed to have embedded stars .",
    "studies of the ophiuchus and perseus clouds by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , suggest that there is a core formation threshold of @xmath106 5 and a star formation threshold of @xmath107 magnitudes ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ionization state of a molecular cloud depends on its density and consequently the visual extinction . as demonstrated by @xcite ,",
    "the ionization profile of a molecular cloud is one in which the outer layers are highly ionized due to photoionization by background ultraviolet ( uv ) starlight , while the inner layers are shielded from the uv photons and ionized by cosmic rays .",
    "this picture assumes a quiescent molecular cloud which has no evidence of star formation in its past ; radiation from previous generations of stars can greatly complicate this picture .",
    "in addition to the extinction thresholds , the linear analysis discussed above showed that there are correlations between the mass - to - flux ratio of the region and the expected time and length scales for collapse . with regards to time scales ,",
    "subcritical regions evolve more slowly than supercritical regions .",
    "conversely , with regards to length scales , highly supercritical or subcritical regions can collapse on smaller length scales than transcritical regions ( i.e. , those with @xmath108 ) .",
    "the following subsections outline our method and results for our two - stage fragmentation model .      in their investigation , @xcite , modeled the chemical evolution of a collapsing clump using a simplified model . here , we have constructed a model ionization profile for the cloud similar to those shown in figure 1 of @xcite . unlike their ionization profiles",
    "however , ours takes into account both the uv and cosmic ray ( cr ) ionization regions .",
    "the uv region is described by a step function of the form @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the ionization fraction , and @xmath39 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the step function parameters , namely the maximum ionization , minimum ionization , location and width of the step respectively . the cosmic ray regime is derived from the well known power - law expression for the ion density ( @xmath114 ) as a function of neutral density ( @xmath115 ) , namely @xmath116 where @xmath117 @xcite . as shown by (",

    "we combine equation  ( [ ni ] ) with vertical hydrostatic equilibrium ( equation  [ hydroequil ] ) . a smooth transition between these two regimes",
    "is chosen to occur at a visual extinction of @xmath118 .",

    "four decimal place accuracy is used for some of the profile parameters to ensure a smooth transition , rather than for empirical reasons .",
    "the midpoint of the drop in ionization ( @xmath112 ) has been adopted to be closer to @xmath124 for comparison to observations in the perseus region ( see section [ comptoobs ] ) .",
    "all numbers above are to be taken as typical values , and our intention in this paper is to outline a general scenario rather than performing a detailed parameter search .",
    "the above profile can also be expressed in terms of the column density instead of the visual extinction . following the prescription of @xcite",
    ", the conversion from visual extinction to column density can be achieved by combining the ratio of h@xmath20 column density to color excess @xcite with the total selective extinction @xcite to yield a conversion factor of @xmath125 .",
    "although this conversion is specifically for h@xmath20 , the abundance ratios of other molecules present in the cloud are so much smaller ( i.e. , the abundance ratio of co to h@xmath20 is on the order of 10@xmath126 ) that they do not contribute significantly to the overall number density .",
    "therefore we assume that the h@xmath20 number density is representative of all species . assuming a mean molecular weight of 2.33 amu , this translates into a mass column density conversion of the form @xmath127 figure  [ xivssigma ] shows the resulting profile for @xmath110 as a function of @xmath128 .",
    "as shown , the adopted model is one which has a steep step function as the ionization fraction drops off at @xmath105 .",

    "for this region , rather than repeating this type of analysis , we use our model to look at two different phenomena .",
    "first , we will apply our model to b59 as a whole .",
    "second , we examine the four cores studied by @xcite .",
    "the four cores in question are core 14 , 40 , 48 and 109 , which come from three distinct regions of the pipe nebula ; 14 resides in b59 , 40 and 48 reside in the stem and core 109 is in the bowl .",

    ", b59 - 09 provides the unique opportunity to look at all three levels of evolution within star formation : clump , cores and ysos .",
    "figure  2 of @xcite shows the centrally condensed @xmath133 profile of the b59 - 09ab cores , centered on the star forming region . assuming a minimum visual extinction threshold for the region of 10 mag , we find that the b59 - 09 clump has a radius of @xmath138  30000  au , which corresponds to a diameter @xmath139  =  0.3  pc .",
    "recent studies of b59 by @xcite show that the star forming core(s ) within b59 , specifically b59 - 09a and 09b , have a molecular hydrogen surface density of @xmath140  =  2.96@xmath141  @xmath142 and a diameter @xmath139  =  0.11  pc .",

    "focussing on the extended region first and comparing the derived length scales to the observed , we conclude that the mass - to - flux ratio of the region is somewhere between 1.1 and 2.0 .",
    "this means that the star forming clump b59 - 09 as a whole is moving out of the transcritical regime and is becoming supercritical . diving a little deeper into this region ,",

    "going one step deeper , if the spacing between the ysos ( @xmath144 pc ) is assumed to have a near one - to - one relationship with the scale of the earlier fragmentation , our analysis can shed some light on the probable conditions in the region at that time .",
    "table  [ b59 ] shows that for both @xmath133 values , in order to match the yso spacing , the region is either significantly subcritical or supercritical .",
    "evidence of ysos within the region suggests the latter as the former have longer collapse times .    with that in mind",
    ", our analysis implies that in order for the ysos to form with such spacing , the local mass - to - flux ratio in the locations of current ysos must have been larger than the surrounding region to promote collapse .",
    "observations show that the magnetic field strength in b59 is 17@xmath145 g @xcite .",
    "we can therefore narrow the visual extinction range in which the yso fragmentation occurred . in order for a subregion to collapse ,",
    "the mass - to - flux ratio must be sufficiently different from the background value . if we assume a minimum mass - to - flux ratio @xmath146 , for @xmath147 @xmath145 g , equation  ( [ obsmu ] ) yields a minimum visual extinction of 14 mag .",
    "therefore , for the extinction range , 14  mag  @xmath148  31.6  mag , the observed magnetic field results in a corresponding mass - to - flux ratio range for the cores to be @xmath149 .",
    "we now consider the four cores from the various regions in the pipe nebula .",
    "table  [ subclumpcomppipe ] shows the results of this analysis . comparing the derived values of @xmath130 with @xmath150 , cores 14 , 40 and 48 seem to agree well with those in either the subcritical regime or highly supercritical regime ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "core 109 does not agree well with any of the three regimes , however it can be concluded that it is not extremely sub- or supercritical but rather somewhere between @xmath1511.1 and 2.0 . with regards to the evolutionary gradient proposed by @xcite , our length scales",
    "do show a trend to smaller length scales for cores 48 , 40 and 14 .",
    "core 109 does not seem to fit in with this trend at all and given its size compared to core 40 could be mistaken as a star forming core .",
    "comparison between the length scales for b59 - 09 and core 14 is not applicable since the latter is not contained in b59 - 09 .",
    "the evolutionary gradient between b59 and the bowl of the pipe nebula is a direct consequence of the different magnetic field strengths present in the different regions ; @xmath152 , and 65 @xmath145 g in b59 , the stem , and the bowl respectively @xcite .",
    "the region with the lowest magnetic field has formed stars while the other two regions have only formed cores .",
    "this is consistent with the results of our other two case studies ( see sections  [ b1e ] and [ b218 ] ) , whereby the delay in star formation is due to a strong magnetic field which forces the region to attain a higher column density before it becomes supercritical and can collapse .    the current state of b59 ( i.e. , shows evidence of several cores / ysos yet has not collapsed itself ) is supported by its apparent transcritical nature .",
    "the age of the stellar cluster within b59 - 09 indicates that the clump has survived for longer than 10 free fall times @xcite .",
    "this again suggests that the magnetic field within the region is strong enough to delay the overall collapse of the b59 - 09 clump @xcite while the inner regions have attained sufficient conditions to form stars .",
    "based on the current data , @xcite propose that b59 - 09 is currently contracting toward a denser configuration .",
    "our model of a transcritical clump is consistent with this assertion .",
    "the underlying model and subsequent results for the two - stage fragmentation scenario , as outlined in section  [ modcalc ] , propose various constraints on the conditions required for such a model to work in nature .",
    "namely , the clump must form in an initially transcritical diffuse environment while core formation requires a denser supercritical region within the parent clump .",
    "from the three case studies presented above , we have found that the observed length scales and corresponding mass - to - flux ratios determined from our analysis tend to support this scenario . in general",
    "it seems that parent clumps exhibit mass - to - flux ratios that are transcritical ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "the column densities of these regions place them to the right hand side of @xmath112 ( see figure  [ tlvssigma ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with our model since formation of subfragments requires that the clump has already crossed over the critical @xmath133 threshold .",
    "our analysis also shows that the fragments within these clumps exhibit length scales that are indicative of regions that are either very subcritical or very supercritical . in order to truly delineate between these two extremes , high resolution magnetic field data",
    "is required , however without such data , some conjectures about the region can still be drawn .",
    "as shown by e.g. , @xcite , the mass - to - flux ratio increases as the density of the region increases .",
    "the denser subfragments within the clump would be expected to have a greater mass - to - flux ratio than the global clump , allowing it to collapse faster than the clump itself ( see figure  [ tlvssigma ] ) .",
    "it is possible for a minority of subfragments to locally have a subcritical mass - to - flux ratio , however these subfragments would likely not be able to collapse faster than their surroundings due to the long time scale required .",
    "although the lack of magnetic field data for most of the regions makes definitively choosing one mass - to - flux regime over the other impossible , it can be assumed that regions with active star formation must be within locally supercritical subfragments , while regions with little to no star - formation are either too young for the subfragments to have collapsed or are largely subcritical .",
    "given the variability of the conditions within cloud regions , figure  [ tlvssigma_enh ] shows an enhanced picture of the two - stage fragmentation model .",
    "the bottom panel shows the fragmentation length scale as a function of column density . in the diffuse regions of the clouds , as indicated earlier , we expect the mass - to - flux ratio be in the transcritical regime .",
    "the parameter space where we expect the fragmentation of the gas into parsec size clumps is indicated by the hatched region to the left of @xmath154 . as shown in the upper panel",
    ", this hatched region corresponds to fragmentation time scales on the order of 2 - 10 myr . as the density of the region increases , as described in section  [ modcalc ] , the region will cross over to the right hand side of @xmath154 .",
    "the hatched region on this side of @xmath154 represents the parameter space for subfragmentation within the clump .",
    "as shown , a wide range of mass - to - flux ratios are considered able to fragment based on the decrease of the fragmentation length scale .",
    "however , the equivalent region in the upper panel of figure  [ tlvssigma_enh ] shows that although regions within this range of mass - to - flux ratios can fragment , only the ones with trans- or supercritical mass - to - flux ratios ( dotted and dash - dot lines respectively ) are able to collapse at a rate that is faster than that of the transcritical clump itself .",
    "we have studied the effect of ambipolar diffusion on the formation of stellar clusters using the results of linear analysis . by combining the linear analysis with realistic ionization profiles for a molecular cloud ,",
    "our analysis has yielded a two - stage fragmentation model for clustered star formation that includes the formation of clumps and their subsequent subfragmentation .",
    "we present several interesting concepts that are worth noting .    1 .",
    "linear analysis shows that there are varying length and time scales for collapse depending on both the mass - to - flux ratio and the neutral - ion collision time of the region ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* this work ) .",
    "transcritical mass - to - flux ratios can have significantly larger fragmentation scales compared to super- and subcritical regions ( figure  [ fig : vsmu ] ; right ) .",
    "subcritical cores have significantly longer collapse time scales compared to their trans- and supercritical counterparts ( figure  [ fig : vsmu ] , left ) . increased neutral - ion collision times",
    "serve to decrease the length and time scales for collapse , particularly for the transcritical and subcritical regimes . 2 .",
    "a combination of the linear analysis and ionization profile shows that molecular cloud conditions are favorable for a two - stage fragmentation process for the formation of stars .",
    "this model suggests that an initially diffuse , transcritical ( i.e. , @xmath34 is approximately unity ) cloud can undergo an initial fragmentation on parsec scales and then undergo a second fragmentation event .",
    "this second event occurs once the density of the clump increases past the threshold where the ionization fraction drops dramatically and the length scale for fragmentation decreases steeply ( figure  [ tlvssigma ] ) .",
    "3 .   comparison with several observed core and star forming regions show that the clump sizes are consistent with their mass - to - flux ratio being transcritical , while the core length scales imply they could be sub- or supercritical .",
    "lack of star formation within the observed regions ( excluding b59 ) could suggest subcritical cores .",
    "however , analysis of the measured magnetic field for perseus and taurus showed that these regions are at least mildly supercritical .",
    "the threshold values for clump / core / star formation as outlined in section  [ ctoc ] are dependent on the region in question and should not be used as strict values .",
    "as shown in our case studies , regions with higher intrinsic magnetic fields will require a greater column density ( higher visual extinction ) to push the region to a transcritical and supercritical mass - to - flux ratio .",
    "the pipe nebula is a perfect example of this , whereby cores in all three regions ( b59 , stem and bowl ) have densities that exceed the star formation threshold @xmath155 in other clouds , but only the region with the lowest magnetic field strength ( b59 ) currently shows evidence of young stellar objects .",
