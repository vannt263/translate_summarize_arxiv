    "presence of water in the stellar environment has been known since 1960 s , especially by the pioneering space observations with the balloon - borne telescope stratoscope ii ( woolf , schwarzschild , & rose 1964 ) .",
    "however , it is the recent iso mission ( kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) that the infrared spectra unobscured by earth s atmosphere have finally been explored in full details .",
    "one of the important results of the highly successful iso mission is that water exists everywhere in the universe and that the star is not an exception .",
    "in fact , water has been detected not only by absorption but also by emission in cool luminous variables such as w hya ( barlow et al .",
    "1996 ; neuffeld et al .",
    "1996 ) , nml cyg ( justtanont et al . 1996 ) , s per ( tsuji et al .",
    "1998 ) , sw vir ( tsuji , aoki , & ohnaka 1999 ) , r cas ( truong - bach et al . 1999 ) , @xmath12 cet ( yamamura , de jong , & cami 1999 ) , vy cma ( neuffeld et al . 1999 ) etc . the exact nature of these emission features , however , is by no means clear yet .",
    "on the other hand , water in the early m ( super)giant stars has been paid little attention until recently , since water has not been detected in these objects nor expected to be abundant in their atmospheres .",
    "nevertheless , water in absorption has finally been detected by iso in the early m ( super)giants ( tsuji et al . 1997 , 1998 ) as well as by the ground based mid - infrared observation in the early m supergiant stars ( jennings & sada 1998 ) .",
    "more correctly , however , water in the early m supergiants had in fact been discovered in the spectra taken by stratoscope ii ( woolf et al .",
    "1964 ; danielson , woolf , & gaustad 1965 ) more than 30 years before the iso mission , although this discovery has been overlooked until recently in favor of the opposing interpretation .",
    "we have shown that the stratoscope observers had correctly identified water in the early m supergiant stars but that the water detected by them is not originating in the photosphere ( tsuji 2000 ) .    to clarify the nature of water found in the early m supergiant stars",
    ", iso should provide the best possibility .",
    "in fact , thanks to the recently released iso archives , we found water in emission in @xmath0 cep for the first time in such an early m supergiant star .",
    "this detection is somewhat unexpected , but this provides not only the definitive evidence for the presence of water in the outer atmosphere of the early m supergiant stars but also a new clue to understanding the nature of water in the stellar environment .",
    "we retrieved the spectra of @xmath0 cep ( m2ia : observed on 1996 dec.18 ut ) and @xmath13 ori ( m2iab : observed on 1997 oct.08 ut ) from the iso archives .",
    "these spectra were observed with the sws ( de graauw et al .",
    "1996 ) by its highest resolution grating mode ( resolution @xmath14 or about 188 km s@xmath15 ) in the region between 2.4 and 45 @xmath0 m .",
    "the region of the h@xmath8o @xmath16 and @xmath17 fundamentals around 2.7 @xmath0 m is somewhat complicated due to the photospheric co and oh bands , but the iso data of both @xmath13 ori and @xmath0 cep show additional absorption features not predicted by the photospheric models . at least , part of these features should be the same origin as the 1.4 and 1.9 @xmath0 m absorption bands , namely h@xmath8o of the non - photospheric origin ( tsuji 2000 ) .",
    "the region of the h@xmath8o @xmath1 fundamentals ( the band origin at 6.3 @xmath0 m ) is shown in fig .",
    ", the spectrum of @xmath13 ori shows only weak absorption features due to h@xmath8o ( indicated by the dotted lines in fig.1a ) , as can be confirmed by the comparison with the h@xmath8o data based on hitemp ( rothman 1997 ) shown in fig.1c , but this detection is the best evidence for water in @xmath13 ori at present .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0 cep shown in fig.1b is quite different with complicated spectral features which show upturn at about 6.4 @xmath0 m in contrast to a smooth decline typical of the rayleigh - jeans spectrum as in @xmath13 ori .",
    "this upturn is explained by the onset of emission due to the @xmath18 branch of the h@xmath8o @xmath1 fundamentals .",
    "thus , the h@xmath8o bands in absorption at 1.4 , 1.9 and 2.7 @xmath0 m turn to emission at 6 @xmath0 m , and this can be regarded as definite evidence for the presence of water in the extended outer atmosphere of @xmath0 cep .",
    "also , some emission features of the observed spectrum are well identified with the fine structures of h@xmath8o bands by the comparison with the h@xmath8o data ( fig.1c ) .",
    "the intensity ratios of the emission features do not agree with those of the optically thin emission represented by the absorption cross - section of h@xmath8o at @xmath19k in fig.1c , and the situation can not be improved by changing the temperature .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0 cep has once been observed by the nasa airborne infrared observatory ( russell , soifer , & forrest 1975 ) , and non - grey behavior from 5 to 8 @xmath0 m has been noted .",
    "the observers preferred to assume excess absorption in the 4 - 5 @xmath0 m rather than excess flux in the 5 - 8 @xmath0 m .",
    "another interpretation was to attribute the observed 5 - 8 @xmath0 m feature as due to emission of h@xmath8o @xmath1 fundamentals , and this was also proposing that water , besides dust , should be an important constituent of the outer atmosphere of @xmath0 cep ( tsuji 1978 ) .",
    "there has been no means by which to test such a proposition at that time , but this is now fully confirmed by the iso sws which clearly resolved the fine structure of the h@xmath8o emission bands .",
    "we already know that h@xmath8o pure rotation lines were observed as absorption in @xmath13 ori by the ground - based high resolution spectroscopy in the 12 @xmath0 m region ( jennings & sada 1998 ) .",
    "however , the spectral resolution of the iso sws is not high enough to detect such faint lines . in the 40 @xmath0 m region of @xmath13 ori",
    ", some emission - like features can be seen ( fig.2a ) , but they can not be identified with the known sources , except for an emission feature at 40.5 @xmath0 m which roughly corresponds to h@xmath8o lines as can be known by the comparison with the h@xmath8o data ( fig.2c ) . however , it is still possible that the observed features are due to the mixture of absorption ( including photospheric lines ) and emission unresolved by the low resolution .",
    "more distinct emission features appear in @xmath0 cep ( fig.2b ) and most of them can be identified with the h@xmath8o pure rotation lines by the comparison with the h@xmath8o data ( fig.2c ) .",
    "the intensity ratios of the emission features again suggest that the emission should be originating from an optically thick source .",
    "such emission features are relatively well seen in the 40 @xmath0 m region , but not so clear in the other mid - infrared region .",
    "one reason for this may be the presence of dust emission . to illustrate this , the entire spectrum of @xmath0 cep observed by the iso sws is shown in fig.3a by the red dots .",
    "it is clear that dust emission dominates the region longward of 8 @xmath0 m .",
    "we showed that a hypothetical absorption slab of h@xmath8o with @xmath20k and @xmath21 @xmath7 above the photosphere explains the 1.4 and 1.9 @xmath0 m bands observed in the stratoscope spectrum of @xmath0 cep ( tsuji 2000 ) .",
    "the presence of emission at the longer wavelength in the spectrum of @xmath0 cep confirms that such a model of the non - photospheric origin of the water spectrum is basically correct , but we must now introduce geometrical extension of the water gas to explain the formation of emission features . for this purpose ,",
    "we replace the simple absorption slab by a spherically symmetric isothermal gaseous envelope of water , whose inner and outer radii are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the density distribution in this envelope is assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium under the gravity field of the central star , and hence major contribution to the spectrum comes from the relatively dense region near @xmath22 . for this reason ,",
    "@xmath22 is more important than @xmath23 .",
    "we already suggested that the emission features may be originating from an optically thick source ( sect.2 ) .",
    "in fact , the column density ( @xmath21 @xmath7 ) and the absorption cross - section of h@xmath8o typically @xmath24 @xmath25 mol@xmath15 at @xmath19k ( figs .",
    "1c and 2c ) suggest that the optical depth of the strong lines should be as large as @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the water envelope is optically quite thick in the lines , and the warm molecular envelope can be referred to as molecular sphere , or molsphere for simplicity .",
    "then , we must solve transfer equation in this molsphere and , since we are to interpret line spectra , the photospheric spectrum including the full details of the absorption lines should exactly be considered as the boundary condition . for this purpose , we apply the photospheric spectrum characterized by @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29k ( fig.1 of tsuji 2000 ) .",
    "the computation has been done with the spectral resolution of about 50000 by the use of the h@xmath8o line database hitemp ( rothman 1997 ) .",
    "after a few trials , we found that @xmath30 results in a spectrum that agrees with the observed one reasonably well .",
    "we also assumed @xmath31 , but this is of minor importance by the reason outlined above .",
    "the resulting emergent spectrum is shown by the green line in fig.3a .    in the spectral region shortward of 5 @xmath0 m",
    ", the molsphere contributes only to absorption , and the upper boundary of the spectrum shown by the green line in fig.3a represents the photospheric continuum , below which co , oh , and sio bands of the photospheric origin can be seen together with the h@xmath8o absorption produced anew in the molsphere ( molecules other than h@xmath8o are not considered in the molsphere ) . at the shorter and longer wavelength sides of 6.3 @xmath0 m , the @xmath32 and @xmath18 branches , respectively , of the h@xmath8o @xmath1 fundamentals are seen in emission above the photospheric continuum ( which is not explicitly shown but can be extrapolated from the near infrared continuum ) .",
    "this emission of water due to the molsphere remains prominent throughout the mid infrared region because of the stronger h@xmath8o pure rotation lines .",
    "the molsphere contributes only to emission in the mid - infrared region and the lower boundary of the spectrum shown by the green line represents the photospheric continuum , below which oh pure rotation lines of the photospheric origin can be seen .",
    "but most of these oh lines are weaker or some oh lines are missing as compared with those in the photospheic spectrum because of the filling in by the overlapping h@xmath8o emission lines from the molsphere .    for comparing the predicted spectrum from the molsphere discussed above with observations , we convolve it with the slit function of sws which is assumed to be the gaussian of fwhm = 187.5 km s@xmath15 and the resulting low resolution spectrum is shown by the blue line in fig.3a . the result",
    "can directly be compared with the observed spectrum in the region shortward of 8 @xmath0 m where dust emission is negligible , and is shifted vertically to fit the observed spectrum of @xmath0 cep shown by the red dots .",
    "a close - up of the region around 6.3 @xmath0 m is shown in fig.3b , where the red dots represent the observed spectrum and the blue line the predicted spectrum from the molsphere , as in fig.3a .",
    "the agreements between the observed and predicted spectra appear to be fine if not perfect .    for interpreting the spectrum lonward of 8 @xmath0 m , effect of dust emission on our predicted spectrum",
    "should be taken into account .",
    "since dust envelope of @xmath0 cep is optically thin ( e.g. tsuji 1978 ) , we simply add the dust emission to the spectrum by the molsphere .",
    "the region near 40@xmath0 m is shown by an expanded scale in fig.3c , where the red dots represent the observed spectrum and the black line the predicted spectrum which is the sum of the spectrum from the molsphere ( the blue line in fig.3a ) and dust emission represented by the rayleigh - jeans spectrum normalized to 162 jy at 40 @xmath0 m .",
    "the agreements between the observed and predicted spectra appear to be reasonable .",
    "this result also shows that the mid - infrared flux of apparently dusty stars such as @xmath0 cep consists not only of dust emission but also of gaseous emission of water .",
    "the contribution of water to the thermal balance in the outer atmosphere as a whole is not very large ( only 10 % or so in the case of @xmath0 cep ) , yet water may be the dominant coolant in the inner part of the outer atmosphere .    in the above analysis , we apply @xmath33 and @xmath4 for h@xmath8o in the molsphere determined by the previous analysis of the stratoscope spectra ( tsuji 2000 ) .",
    "we confirmed that these parameters explain the iso spectra as well and no improvement is gained if these parameters are changed .",
    "certainly , these parameters are better determined from absorption rather than from emission spectra .",
    "also , the near infrared spectrum predicted from the molsphere agrees well with the stratoscope spectrum , which was interpreted by the simpler slab model in our previous analysis .",
    "the new constraint imposed by the iso spectra is essentially the inner radius of the molsphere , @xmath22 .",
    "in fact , the emission features are quite sensitive to @xmath22 , and the emission tends to be much stronger for @xmath34 larger than @xmath35 we have adopted .",
    "further , the 6 @xmath0 m emission turns to absorption for the smaller values , e.g. @xmath36 . the weak 6 @xmath0 m absorption seen in @xmath13 ori ( fig.1a ) can be explained this way .",
    "also , neither emission nor absorption will appear from the molsphere for some intermediate values of @xmath34 and the mid - infrared region of @xmath13 ori ( fig.2a ) may be such a case .",
    "returning to @xmath0 cep , the value of @xmath37 we have suggested should have important implications .",
    "especially , this result suggests that water is absent in the region between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and water of the molsphere may be formed anew somewhere at about @xmath40 above the photosphere rather than the region very close to the photosphere .",
    "this fact should be kept in mind in considering the origin of water in the molsphere .",
    "we found distinct emission of water at 6 @xmath0 m and 40 @xmath0 m regions in the iso spectrum of @xmath0 cep in addition to the absorption bands at 1.4 , 1.9 and 2.7 @xmath0 m in the near infrared .",
    "we showed that all these observed features can be explained consistently by a simple model of the optically thick molecular sphere with modest temperature ( e.g. 1500k ) at modest distance above the photosphere ( e.g. about one stellar radius ) .",
    "what we have proposed , however , is not a model of the usual meaning but simply an intuitive interpretation on the observed data , since our `` model '' can not yet be constructed based on the first principle .",
    "in fact , the presence of the optically thick molecular envelope , which we referred to as the molsphere for simplicity , has never been predicted by any theory of stellar atmospheres so far as we are aware .",
    "thus , despite the simplicity of the picture we propose , the physics behind the apparently simple phenomenon remains obscure and offers a challenging problem to the theory of stellar atmospheres .",
    "recently , presence of water has been shown in several cool stars by iso ( sect.1 ) , but interpretation of the observed spectra is by no means clear . on the other hand , we could present a simple but consistent interpretation for the case of @xmath0 cep and this may be due to fortunate situations as follow . _ first _ , @xmath0 cep is unique in that water could be observed through the near- to mid - infrared ( including the stratoscope data ) and not only in absorption but also in emission .",
    "_ second _ , @xmath0 cep has the molsphere which has just developed to an adequate size . for comparison ,",
    "@xmath13 ori may be the case in which the molsphere is not yet developed enough to give clear observed features , or emission and absorption ( including the photospheric contributions ) may be nearly canceled . on the contrary ,",
    "the cooler supergiants may have well developed molsphere , the observed features from which may be heavily saturated and more difficult to interpret .",
    "_ third _ , the spectrum of @xmath0 cep shows almost no photospheric water band , unlike the case of the cooler objects which show strong photospheric water bands difficult to discriminate from those originating in the molsphere .",
    "_ fourth _ , the molsphere of @xmath0 cep may be relatively free from complexities due to the dynamical effect such as by a large amplitude pulsation .",
    "for all these reasons , the spectra of @xmath0 cep could be interpreted relatively well and this may provide the proto - type of the molsphere , which should most probably exist in the outer atmosphere of cool luminous stars in general .",
    "we finally confirmed that water exists not only in very cool luminous variables , but also in the early m supergiants and possibly in most m ( super)giant stars .",
    "this fact implies that the presence of water is not due to some secondary effect such as a large amplitude pulsation but may be due to a more intrinsic property of cool stars .",
    "for example , the molsphere may have some connection with the chromosphere which also exists in the outer atmosphere of the most cool stars , but its origin is by no means clear yet . by the opening of the infrared spectral region by iso",
    ", we have now a means by which to explore the new component of the outer atmosphere which is rather warm ( molsphere ) , in addition to the hot chromosphere and the cool expanding gas - dust envelope known so far .",
    "the problem is how to understand these multiple components of different thermal and kinematical properties in a unified model , and we now have a possibility to arrive at a more balanced view of the stellar outer atmosphere by considering all its major constituents .",
