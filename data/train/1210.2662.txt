    "the temperature of the inner disk region @xmath28 increases with the spin parameter @xmath2 , which increases the energy density of the soft photons emitted from the disk .",
    "this leads to the corona cooling efficiently , because the cooling of the corona is dominated by the compton scattering of the soft photons from the disk .",
    "the electron temperature of the corona in the inner region of the disk is therefore lower for rapidly spinning black holes ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the resulted spectra of the disk - corona systems with magnetic stress tensor @xmath193 show that both the hard x - ray spectral index and the hard x - ray bolometric correction factor @xmath38 increase with the eddington ratio , which are qualitatively consistent with the observations of agns @xcite , and x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "the observed ratio of @xmath194 may provide additional information of the disk - corona systems @xcite .",
    "the stress tensor @xmath195 was initially suggested by @xcite based on the idea that the viscosity is proportional to the gas pressure , but the size of turbulence should be limited by the disk scale height determined by the total pressure .",
    "this is also supported by the analysis on the local dynamical instabilities in magnetized , radiation - pressure - supported accretion disks @xcite .",
    "however , recent radiative mhd simulations seem to prefer the stress tensor @xmath196 @xcite .",
    "our model calculations can be carried out when the form of magnetic stress tenor is specified .",
    "for simplicity , in most cases of this work , we calculate the structure and emergent spectra of accretion disk - corona systems using the magnetic stress tensor @xmath193 .",
    "the radiation from the corona is almost isotropic due to its optically thin and geometrically thick structure , while the radiation from the disk is anisotropic .",
    "it is therefore found that the hard x - ray spectral index @xmath174 is insensitive with the viewing angle @xmath102 .",
    "the x - ray spectra are mainly dominated by the inverse compton scattering , which mainly depends on the temperature of the electrons .",
    "therefore the trend of the photon spectral indices @xmath174 and the x - ray correction factors @xmath1 can be explained by the decrease of the temperature of the electrons with increasing mass accretion rate @xmath161 , or the black hole spin parameter @xmath2 ( see figure [ fig5 ] , and also figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the photon index @xmath174 of the hard x - ray spectrum becomes large when the black hole is rapidly spinning if all other parameters are fixed , which is due to the temperature of the electrons decreases with increasing value of @xmath2 .",
    "the correction factor @xmath197 derived by the model calculations with @xmath193 are significantly larger than the observed values when @xmath198 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "one possibility is that an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) is present in the inner region of the disk @xcite .",
    "the inner adaf is x - ray luminous , which leads to a low value of @xmath197 @xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that the x - ray spectra of the agns are hard when accreting at low rates ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for the detailed discussion ) .",
    "an alternative resolution is the model with magnetic stress tenor @xmath196 , however , it always predicts a constant @xmath199 independent of mass accretion rate @xmath161 .",
    "this needs further investigations in the future .    in figure",
    "[ fig7 ] , the spectral shapes of the disk - corona model with different values of accretion rates @xmath161 and black hole spin parameter @xmath2 in the near - infrared / optical bands are plotted , which is dominantly contributed by the blackbody radiation from the disk .",
    "the spectral shapes are significantly different from @xmath176 , as expected in standard thin disk model .",
    "this is mainly caused by the @xmath15-dependent temperature distributions in the disks surrounding massive black holes and the outer radii of the disks being different from those in standard thin disk model . in the standard thin disk model , the spectral shape @xmath176 in the near - infrared / optical wavebands",
    "is derived by assuming the temperature of the accretion disk @xmath200 and the disk to extend to infinity .",
    "however , the temperature profiles of relativistic accretion disks deviate significantly from @xmath201 in the inner region of the disk ( @xmath202 ) ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the contribution to the spectra in ir / optical bands from the blackbody radiation of the outer region of the disks can also be quite important .",
    "the outer radius of the disk is a function of black hole mass @xmath12 and accretion rate @xmath161 ( see figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the observational slope of the infrared continua can be used to constrain the accretion disk model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it is not suitable to compare the observed spectra only with , @xmath176 , as predicted by the standard accretion disk model . in this work ,",
    "the local radiation from the disk is approximated as blackbody emission .",
    "a better approximation is to include a spectral hardening factor in calculating the local spectrum of the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with which the energy peak of the calculated disk spectrum will shift to a slightly higher frequency , while the spectral shape changes little .",
    "this would be important for detailed fitting the observed sed of agns , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "it is assumed that zero torque at the inner edge of the disk , which was doubted in some previous works @xcite .",
    "the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( grmhd ) simulations provide an effective tool to explore the torque in the plunging region @xcite . in the accretion disk with the thickness",
    "@xmath203 the magnetic torque at the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) is only @xmath204 of the inward flux of angular momentum at this radius , which indicates that the zero torque is really a good approximation for geometrically thin disks @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the accretion disk - corona model similar to that developed by @xcite , in which a non - zero torque at the inner edge of the disk is assumed . as the detailed accretion physics in the plunging region is complicated and still quite unclear",
    ", we adopt the assumption of no torque in the inner edge of the accretion disk in all our calculations .",
    "the calculations in this work were carried out for massive black holes , which will be compared with the observed spectra of agns in our future work .",
    "the model calculations can also be applicable to x - ray binaries .",
