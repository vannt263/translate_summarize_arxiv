    "pictures like the ones in figure [ figure : braids ] give an excellent intuitive feeling for the braid group , but one that quickly becomes complicated when one tries to pin down details .",
    "what is the ambient space ? ( it is a slice @xmath3 of 3-space . ) are admissible isotopies constrained to @xmath4 ?",
    "( yes , we can not allow isotopies in which the strands are allowed to loop over the initial points . )",
    "does isotopy mean level - preserving isotopy ?",
    "( no , it will not matter if we allow more general isotopies in @xmath3 , as long as strands do nt pass through one - another . )",
    "are strands allowed to self - intersect ?",
    "( no , to allow self - intersections would give the ` homotopy braid group ' , a proper homomorphic image of the group that is our primary focus . )",

    "( yes , it will become obvious shortly how to modify the definition . )",
    "we will bypass these questions and other related ones by giving several more sophisticated definitions . in @xmath5[subsection : bbn and bpn via configuration spaces ] , @xmath5[subsection : definition of bbn via generators and relations ] and @xmath5[subsection : bbn and bpn as mapping class groups ] we will define the braid group @xmath0 and pure braid group @xmath6 in three distinct ways",
    ". we will give a proof that two of them yield the same group .",
    "references to the literature establish the isomorphism in the remaining case . in @xmath5[subsection : braiding is fundamental ] we will demonstrate the universality of ` braiding ' by describing four examples which show how braids have played a role in parts of mathematics which seem far away from knot theory .",

    "while the manifold @xmath18 has dimension @xmath19 , the fact that the points @xmath20 are pairwise distinct allows us to think of a point @xmath21 as a set of @xmath7 distinct points on @xmath8 .",

    "is follows that the group @xmath6 is a subgroup of index @xmath31 in @xmath0 , and there is a short exact sequence :    @xmath33      we give two definitions of the group @xmath0 by generators and relations .",

    "one then constructs a homeomorphism of the punctured disc to itself in such a way that the trace of the isotopy to the identity is the given set of @xmath7 non - intersecting simple arcs .    to prove the theorem , we begin by establishing the isomorphism between @xmath6 and @xmath86 . a good general reference for the underlying mathematics",

    "it is clear that @xmath90 is continuous with respect to the compact open topology on @xmath91 and the subspace topology for @xmath92 .",
    "the topological group @xmath93 acts @xmath7-transitively on the disc in the sense that if @xmath94 are @xmath7 distinct points and @xmath95 are @xmath7 others then there is an @xmath96 such that @xmath97 .",
    "observe that if @xmath98 then @xmath99 and if @xmath100 with @xmath101 , then @xmath102 are in the same left coset of @xmath91 in @xmath75 . in this situation it is shown in @xcite , part i , sections 7.3 and 7.4 , that the 3-tuple @xmath103 is a fiber space , with total space diff@xmath104 , base space @xmath105 projection @xmath90 and fiber diff@xmath106 .",
    "( it is a good exercise for a graduate student to prove this directly by constructing the required local product structure in an explicit manner . )",
    "the long exact sequence of homotopy groups of a fibration then gives the following exact sequence of groups and homomorphisms , where we focus on the range that is of interest : @xmath107 the two end groups are trivial .",
    "the left middle group is @xmath6 and the right middle group is @xmath86 .",
    "the isomorphism of theorem [ theorem : isomorphism between bbn and mcg of punctured disc ] is @xmath108 .",
    "tracing through the mathematics one finds that in fact its inverse is the map that we described right after we stated the theorem .",
    "the assertion about @xmath6 is therefore true .",
    "the proof for @xmath0 can then be completed by comparing the short exact sequence ( [ equation : bbn , bpn and symmetric gp ] ) , which says that @xmath0 is a finite extension of @xmath6 with quotient the symmetric group with a related short exact sequence for the mapping class groups : @xmath109    thus @xmath70 is a finite extension of @xmath86 with quotient the symmetric group @xmath110 .",
    "comparing corresponding groups in the short exact sequences ( [ equation : bbn , bpn and symmetric gp ] ) and ( [ equation : mcg gp , pure mcg and symmetric gp ] ) , we see that the first two and last two are isomorphic .",
    "the 5-lemma then shows that the middle ones are too .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem [ theorem : isomorphism between bbn and mcg of punctured disc ] .",
    "we discuss , briefly , a variety of examples , outside of knot theory , where ` braiding ' is an essential aspect of a mathematical or physical problem .",
    "configuration spaces and the braid group appear in a natural way in algebraic geometry .",
    "consider the complex polynomial @xmath111 of degree @xmath7 with @xmath7 distinct complex roots @xmath20 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath112 are the elementary symmetric polynomials in @xmath113 , and so we get a continuous map @xmath114 which takes roots to coefficients .",
    "two points have the same image if and only if they differ by a permutation , so we get the same identification as in the quotient map @xmath30 , in quite a different way .",
    "since we are requiring that our polynomial have @xmath7 distinct roots , a point @xmath115 is in the image of @xmath116 under the root - to - coefficient map if and only if the polynomial @xmath117 has @xmath7 distinct roots , i.e. if and only if its coefficients avoid the points where the discriminant @xmath118 expressed as a polynomial in @xmath115 , vanishes .",
    "thus @xmath119 can be interpreted as the complement in @xmath120 of the algebraic hypersurface defined by the equation @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is rewritten as a polynomial in the coefficients @xmath112 .",
    "( for example , the polynomial @xmath123 has distinct roots precisely when @xmath124 ) . in this setting the base point @xmath125",
    "is regarded as the choice of a complex polynomial of degree @xmath7 which has @xmath7 distinct roots , and an element in the braid group is a choice of a continuous deformation of that polynomial along a path on which two roots never coincide .",
    "there is a substantial literature in this area , from which we mention only one paper , by gorin and lin @xcite .",
    "we chose it because it contains a description of the commutator subgroup @xmath126 of the braid group , and many people have asked the first author for a reference on that over the years . while there may be other references they are unknown to us .",
    "our next example , taken from the work of vaughan jones @xcite,@xcite , is interesting because it shows how ` braiding ' can appear in disguise , so that initially one misses the connection .",
    "we consider the theory , in operator algebras , of ` type ii@xmath127 factors ' , ordered by inclusion .",
    "let @xmath128 denote a von neumann algebra , i.e. an algebra of bounded operators acting on a hilbert space @xmath73 .",
    "the algebra @xmath128 is called a if its center consists only of scalar multiples of the identity .",
    "the factor is type ii@xmath127 if it admits a linear functional , called a trace , @xmath129 , which satisfies the following three conditions : ( i ) @xmath130 ,   ( ii ) @xmath131 ,   and @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the adjoint of @xmath134 . in this situation",
    "it is known that the trace is unique , in the sense that it is the only linear functional satisfying the first two conditions .",
    "an old discovery of murray and von neumann was that factors of type ii@xmath127 provide a type of ` scale ' by which one can measure the dimension of @xmath73 .",
    "the notion of dimension which occurs here generalizes the familiar notion of integer - valued dimensions , because for appropriate @xmath128 and @xmath73 it can be any non - negative real number or @xmath135 .",
    "the starting point of jones work was the following question : if @xmath136 is a type ii@xmath127 factor and if @xmath137 is a subfactor , is there any restriction on the real numbers which occur as the ratio @xmath138 ?",
    "the question has the flavor of questions one studies in galois theory . on the face of it",
    ", there was no reason to think that @xmath139 could not take on any value in @xmath140 $ ] , so jones answer came as a complete surprise .",
    "he called @xmath139 the @xmath141 of @xmath142 in @xmath136 , and proved a type of rigidity theorem about type ii@xmath127 factors and their subfactors :    * the jones index theorem : * @xmath143 \\cup \\{4 cos 2\\pi / p\\}$ ] , where @xmath144 .",
    "moreover , each real number in the continuous part of the spectrum @xmath145 $ ] and in the discrete part @xmath146 is realized .",
    "what does all this have to do with braids ? to answer the question , we sketch the idea of the proof , which is to be found in @xcite .",
    "jones begins with the type ii@xmath127 factor @xmath136 and the subfactor @xmath142 .",
    "there is also a tiny bit of additional structure : it turns out that in this setting there exists a map @xmath147 , known as the of @xmath136 on @xmath142 .",
    "the map @xmath148 is a projection , i.e. @xmath149 .",
    "his first step is to prove that the ratio @xmath139 is independent of the choice of the hilbert space @xmath73 .",
    "this allows him to choose an appropriate @xmath73 so that the algebra @xmath150 generated by @xmath136 and @xmath148 makes sense .",
    "he then investigates @xmath150 and proves that it is another type ii@xmath127 factor , which contains @xmath136 as a subfactor , moreover @xmath151 . having in hand another ii@xmath127 factor @xmath150 and its subfactor @xmath136 , there is also a trace on @xmath150 ( which by the uniqueness of the trace ) coincides with the trace on @xmath136 when it is restricted to @xmath136 , and another conditional expectation @xmath152 .",
    "this allows jones to iterate the construction , to build algebras @xmath153 and from them a family of algebras @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is generated by @xmath156 .    rewriting history a little bit in order to make the subsequent connection with braids a little more transparent",
    ", we now replace the projections @xmath157 , which are not units , by a new set of generators which are units , defining : @xmath158 , where @xmath159 .",
    "the @xmath160 s generate @xmath155 because the @xmath157 s do , and we can solve for the @xmath157 s in terms of the @xmath160 s .",
    "so @xmath161 is generated by @xmath162 and we have a tower of algebras , @xmath163 , ordered by inclusion . the parameter @xmath164 , which replaces the index @xmath139 , is the quantity now under investigation .",
    "it s woven into the construction of the tower .",
    "the algebra @xmath165 has defining relations : @xmath166 of course there are braids lurking in the background . if we rename the @xmath167 , replacing @xmath168 by @xmath36 , and declare the @xmath169 to be generators of a group , then the first two relations are defining relations in the group algebra @xmath170 .",
    "the algebra @xmath165 is thus a homomorphic image of the group algebra of the braid group . loosely speaking ,",
    "braids are encountered in operator algebras because they encode the way in which each type ii@xmath127 factor @xmath171 acts on its subfactor @xmath172 .",
    "braiding is thus involved in defining the associated extensions .",
    "we shall see later , in @xmath5[subsection : additional representations ] that a similar action , via group extensions , can be used to define representations of @xmath0 .    to see the connection with knots and links , recall that since @xmath173 is type ii@xmath127 it supports a unique trace , and since @xmath155 is a subalgebra it does too , by restriction .",
    "this trace is known as a , i.e. it satisfies the important property : @xmath174 where @xmath175 is a fixed function of @xmath164 .",
    "thus , for each fixed value of @xmath176 the trace is multiplied by a fixed scalar when one passes from one stage of the tower to the next , if one does so by multiplying an arbitrary element of @xmath155 by the new generator @xmath177 of @xmath178 .",
    "the jones trace is nothing more or less than the 1-variable jones polynomial @xcite associated to the knot or link which is obtained from the closed braid .",
    "we will have more to say about all this in @xmath5[subsubsection : hecke algebras and polynomial invariants of knots ] .",
    "as before , let @xmath179 denote the pure braid group on @xmath180 strands .",
    "for each @xmath181 there is a natural homomorphism @xmath182 , defined by pulling out the @xmath183 strand .",
    "the group of braids is @xmath184 i.e. a braid is in @xmath185 if and only if , on pulling out any strand , it becomes the identity braid on @xmath7 strands .",
    "brunnian braids have received some attention in knot theory .",
    "braids have played a role in homotopy theory for many years , most particularly in the work of f. cohen and his students ( see for example @xcite ) , but during the past few years the connection was sharpened when it was discovered that there is an embedding of a free group @xmath186 in @xmath187 with the property that a well - defined quotient of @xmath188 ( a little bit too complicated to describe here ) is isomorphic to @xmath189 . it remains to be seen whether new knowledge about the unidentified higher homotopy groups of spheres can be obtained through the methods of @xcite .",
    "our fourth example is an application of configuration spaces to robotics .",
    "it shows the braid group popping up in an unexpected way ( until you realize how natural it is ) .",
    "robots , or agvs ( automatic guided vehicles ) , are required to travel across a factory floor that contains many obstacles , en route to a goal position ( e.g. a loading dock or an assembly workstation ) .",
    "the problem is to design a control system which insures that the agvs not collide with the obstacles , or with each other , and complete the task with efficiency with regard to various work functionals . here",
    "is how configuration spaces appear : the underlying space in this simple example is the workspace floor @xmath190 , from which a finite set @xmath191 of obstacles are to be removed .",
    "the configuration space of @xmath7 non - colliding agvs is then precisely @xmath192 .",
    "more generally , @xmath193 is replaced by a finite graph @xmath194 , and the the braid group @xmath0 by the braid group @xmath195 of the graph .",
    "there is a vast literature on this subject ; we suggest @xcite by r. ghrist , as a starter .      in this",
    "example braids are important for rather different reasons than they were in our earlier examples . in our earlier examples",
    "the underlying phenomenon which was being investigated involved actual braiding , albeit sometimes in a concealed way . in the example that we now describe particular properties of the braid groups @xmath196 , rather than the actual interweaving of braid strands , are used in a clever way to construct a new method for encrypting data .",
    "the problem which is the focus of ` public key cryptography ' will be familiar to everyone : the security of our online communications , for example our credit card purchases , our atm transactions , our cell phone conversations and a host of other transactions that have become a part of everyday life in the @xmath197 century , the basic problem is to encrypte or translate a secret message into a code that can be sent safely over a public system such as the internet , and decoded at the receiving end by the use of a secret piece of information known only to the sender and the recipient , the ` key ' .",
    "the problem that must then be solved is to establish a private key that will be known only to the sender and the recipient , who will then be able to exchange information over an insecure channel . in recent years",
    "much work has been done on certain codes which are based upon the assumption that the word problem has polynomial growth as braid index @xmath7 is increased , whereas the conjugacy problem does not .",
    "but in @xmath5[section : the word and conjugacy problems in the braid groups ] we will review recent work on the word and conjugacy problems in the braid groups , and show that such an assumption seems problematic at best .",
    "see @xmath5[section : the word and conjugacy problems in the braid groups ] , and in particular the discussion in @xmath5[subsection : braid groups and public key cryptography ] below .",

    "in this chapter we will explore , for the benefit of readers who are new to the subject , the foundations of the close relationship between knots and braids .",
    "we will first describe the straightforward process of obtaining a knot or a link from a given braid by ` closing ' the braid .",
    "this leads us directly to formulate two fundamental questions about knots and braids .",
    "first , is it always possible to transform a given knot into a closed braid ?",
    "this question will be answered in the affirmative in theorem [ theorem : alexander s theorem ] , first proved by alexander in 1928 in @xcite .",
    "the correspondence between knots and braids is clearly not one - to - one ( for example , conjugate braids yield equivalent knots ) , leading naturally to the second question : which closed braids represent the same knot type ?",
    "that question is addressed in theorem [ theorem : mt ] , first formulated by a. markov in @xcite , which gives ` moves ' relating any two closed braid representatives of a knot or link , while simultaneously preserving the closed braid structure .",
    "together , theorems [ theorem : alexander s theorem ] and [ theorem : mt ] form the cornerstone of any study of knots via closed braids , so we feel obliged to prove them . among the many proofs that have been published of both over the years , we have chosen ones that we like but which do not seem to have appeared in any of the review articles that we know .",
    "the proof that we give of alexander s theorem is due to shuji yamada @xcite , with subsequent improvements by pierre vogel @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is elementary enough to be accessible to a beginner , and has the advantage for experts of being suitable for programming .",

    "let us begin with a planar diagram of a given geometric braid . to obtain a knot or link , one simply ` closes up ' the ends of the braid as in figure  [ figure : braidclosure ] .     to form a closed braid ]    the pre - image in @xmath198 of the ` center point ' shown in figure  [ figure : braidclosure ] under the usual projection map",

    "iterating , we obtain transverse closed braids @xmath586 , defining transverse knot types @xmath587 , and no two have the same bennequin invariant . since stabilization does not change the topological knot type , the assertion follows .    at this writing",

    "a hint that the problem might turn out to be quite subtle was in the paper @xcite by fuchs and tabachnikov , who proved that while ragbags filled with polynomial and finite type invariants of transversal knot types @xmath563 exist , based upon the work of arnold in @xcite , they are all determined by @xmath588_{top}$ ] and @xmath576 .",

    "there are also two numerical invariants of @xmath589 : the thurston - bennequin invariant @xmath591 ( a self - linking number ) and the maslov index @xmath592 ( a rotation number ) .",
    "so until a few years ago the same question existed in the legendrian setting , but the legendrian case has recently been settled by yuri chekanov :    @xcite there exist distinct legendian knot types which have the same topological knot type@xmath590_{top}$ ] , and also the same thurston - bennequin invariant @xmath591 and maslov index @xmath592 .    the analogous result for transversal knots proved to be quite difficult , so to begin to understand whether something could be done via braid theory , the first author and nancy wrinkle asked an easier question , which they answered in part in @xcite : are there transversal knot types which _ are determined _ by their topological knot type and bennequin number ?",
    "this question lead to a definition : a transversal knot type @xmath563 is if it is determined by @xmath588_{top}$ ] and @xmath576 .",

    "this theorem was used to give a new proof of a theorem of eliashberg @xcite , which asserts that the unlink is transversally simple , and also ( with the help of @xcite ) to prove the then - new result that most iterated torus knots are transversally simple .",
    "the rest of this section will be directed at explaining the main result of @xcite :    @xcite [ theorem : negative flype examples ] there exist transversal knot types which are not transversally simple .",
    "explicitly , the transverse closed @xmath593-braids @xmath594 and @xmath595 determine transverse knot types @xmath596 with @xmath597 and @xmath598 , but @xmath599 .",
    "* sketch of the proof of theorem [ theorem : negative flype examples ] . *",
    "see @xcite for all details .",
    "the examples in theorem [ theorem : negative flype examples ] were obtained by choosing all the weights in the negative flype template to be 1 , and assigning explicit 2-braids to the blocks @xmath600 of the negative flype template of figure [ figure : templates ] .",
    "if the weights are all chosen to be 1 , the blocks @xmath601 are 2-braids and ( except in very special cases ) the flype templates have braid index 3 . first one must show that the examples satisfy the conditions of the theorem .",
    "the topological knot types defined by the closed 3-braids @xmath602 and @xmath603 coincide because they are carried by the block strand diagrams for the negative flype template of figure [ figure : templates ] .",
    "the bennequin invariant can be computed as the exponent sum of the braid word ( 14 in both cases ) minus the braid index ( 3 in both cases ) .",
    "so the examples have the required properties .",
    "the hard part is the establishment of a special version of theorem [ theorem : mtws ] which is applicable to the situation .",
    "its special features are as follows :    both @xmath527 and @xmath524 have braid index 3 .    since it is well known that exchange moves can be replaced by braid isotopy for 3-braids , the first two sequences in theorem [ theorem : mtws ] are vacuous , i.e. @xmath604 .    because of the special assumption just noted , the templates that are needed , in the topological setting , can be enumerated explicitly : they are the positive and negative destabilization and the positive and negative flype templates .",
    "no others are needed .",
    "it is proved in @xcite that if @xmath524 and @xmath527 are transversal closed braids @xmath605 and @xmath606 , then the isotopy that takes @xmath605 to @xmath606 may be assumed to be transversal .",
    "so , suppose that a transversal isotopy exists from the transverse closed braid @xmath605 to the transverse closed braid @xmath606 .",
    "then there is a @xmath593-braid template that carries the braids @xmath602 and @xmath603 .",
    "this is the first key fact that we use from theorem [ theorem : mtws ] . instead of having to consider _ all _ possible transversal isotopies from @xmath605 to @xmath606 , we only need to consider those that relate the left and right block - strand diagrams in one of the four 3-braid templates .",
    "so the braids in question are carried either by one of the two destabilization templates or by one of the two flype templates .",
    "if it was one of the destabilization templates , then the knots in question could be represented by 2 or 1-braids , i.e. they would be type @xmath607 torus knots or the unknot , however an easy argument shows that the knots in theorem [ theorem : negative flype examples ] are neither type @xmath607 torus knots or the unknot .",
    "the positive flype templates are ruled out in different way : topologically , our closed braids admit a negative flype , so if they are also carried by the positive flype template they admit flypes of both signs . however , the manuscript @xcite gives conditions under which a closed 3-braid admits flypes of both signs , and the examples were chosen explicitly to rule out that possibility .",
    "we are reduced to isotopies that are supported by the negative flype template .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the obvious isotopy is not transversal , but maybe there is some _ other _ isotopy which is transversal . here",
    "a key fact about the definition of a template is used ( and this is a second very strong aspect of the mtws ) .",
    "if such a transversal isotopy exists , then it exists for every knot or link defined by a fixed choice of braiding assignments to the blocks .",
    "choose the braiding assignments @xmath608 to the blocks @xmath609 .",
    "this braiding assignment gives a 2-component link @xmath610 which has two distinct isotopy classes of closed 3-braid representatives . if @xmath611 is the component associated to the left strand entering the block @xmath612 , then @xmath613 and @xmath614 before the flype , but after the flype the representative will be @xmath615 , with @xmath616 and @xmath617 .",
    "however , by eliashberg s isotopy extension theorem ( proposition 2.1.2 of @xcite ) a transversal isotopy of a knot / link extends to an ambient transversal isotopy of the 3-sphere .",
    "any transversal isotopy of @xmath618 must preserve the @xmath472-invariants of the components .",
    "it follows that no such transversal isotopy exists , a contradiction of our assumption that @xmath605 and @xmath606 are transversally isotopic .",
    "other examples of a similar nature were discovered by etnyre and honda @xcite after the proof of theorem [ theorem : negative flype examples ] was posted on the arxiv .",
    "their methods are very different from the proof that we just described ( being based on contact theory techniques rather than topological techniques ) , but are equally indirect .",
    "they do not produce explicit examples , rather they present a bag of pairs of transverse knots and prove that at least one pair in the bag exists with the properties given by theorem [ theorem : negative flype examples ] .",
    "therefore we pose , as an important open problem :    find new computable invariants of transversal knot types . here",

    "before the discovery of hecke algbra representations of the braid group ( discussed in this section ) very little was known about finite dimensional but infinite representations of @xmath0 , except for the ubiquitous burau representation .",
    "that matter changed dramatically in 1987 with the publication of @xcite . suddenly , we had more knot invariants and with them more braid group representations than anyone could deal with , and the issue became one of organizing them . however , we shall not attempt to give a comprehensive overview of the rich theory of representations of braid groups in this section .",
    "instead , we focus here on the representations of @xmath0 which have played the greatest roles in the development of that theory : the burau representation , the hecke algebra representations , and , more recently , the lawrence - krammer representation .",

    "the first interesting representation of a braid group occurs when @xmath634 , corresponding to the partition @xmath635 .",

    "we are interested in the complexity of the algorithm , and ask whether it is polynomial in either braid index @xmath7 or word length @xmath973 or both ?",
    "the word problem and the conjugacy are two of the three classical ` decision problems ' first posed by max dehn @xcite . in the case we consider here of @xmath974 , the set of generators we choose will be those of either the classical or the new presentation .",
    "artin gave the first solution to the word problem for the braid group in 1925 @xcite , and a number of fundamentally different solutions to the word problem in @xmath975 exist today , with at least two of them being polynomial in both @xmath7 and @xmath973 .",
    "we focus here on an approach due to frank garside @xcite and improved on by a number of others , and briefly describe other methods at the end of this section .    on the other hand , we know of only one definitive solution to the conjugacy problem , namely the combinatorial solution that was discovered by garside .",
    "he found a finite set of conjugates of an arbitrary element @xmath968\\in { \\bf b}_n$ ] , the ` summit set ' @xmath976 of @xmath967 , with the properties that if @xmath977 , then @xmath978 , whereas if @xmath979 , then @xmath980 .",
    "if @xmath978 , his methods also find @xmath225 such that @xmath981 .",
    "while his algorithm has been improved in major ways over the years , at this writing it is exponential in both @xmath7 and @xmath973 .",
    "the principle difficulties may be explained in the following way :    the entire set @xmath976 and a single element in @xmath982 must be computed to decide whether @xmath967 and @xmath472 are or are not conjugate .",
    "while the calculation of a single element can now be done rapidly , in the general case @xmath976 has unpredictable size .",
    "the combinatorics that determine the size of @xmath976 are particularly subtle and difficult to understand , and at this writing only partial progress has been made , in spite of much effort by experts .",
    "the improvements that have been made over the years have included the replacement of @xmath976 by a proper subset @xmath983 the ` super summit set ' , via the work of elrifai and morton in @xcite .",
    "however , while @xmath984 is very much smaller than @xmath976 , the principle difficulty @xmath985 is unchanged .",
    "very recently gebhardt found a still smaller subset , the ` ultra summit set @xmath986 ' , to replace @xmath984 @xcite .",
    "the difficulty is unfortunately the same as it was for the summit set and the super summit set , but can be made more specific : the thing that one needs to understand is the number of ` closed cycling orbits ' in @xmath986 and the length of each orbit , and how distinct orbits are related",
    ". sang jin lee @xcite has given examples to show that the number of orbits and their size can be arbitrarily large , and that it is in no way clear how distinct orbits are related , except in special cases .",
    "more work remains to be done .",
    "it was shown in theorem [ theorem : isomorphism between bbn and mcg of punctured disc ] , proved earlier in this article , that there is a faithful action of the braid group @xmath0 on the @xmath7-times punctured disc . investigating this action ( in the more general setting of the action of the mapping class group of a 2-manifold on the 2-manifold ) , thurston proposed in the early 1980 s a very different approach to the conjugacy problem which is based upon the dynamical properties of that action .",
    "these ideas were investigated in lee mosher s phd thesis @xcite .",
    "the curious fact is that while the dynamical picture quickly yields several very interesting class invariants not easily seen in the combinatorial picture , namely a graph ( known as a ` train track ' ) which is embedded in the surface and is invariant under the action of properly chosen representatives of @xmath969 , and a real number @xmath139 , however they are not enough to determine conjugacy .",
    "generic elements in the mapping class group of a surface have an invariant train track , but it is not unique .",
    "it is known that there are finitely many possible train tracks associated to a given element , but their enumeration remains an unsolved problem , and that is what gets in the way of a nice solution to the conjugacy problem .",
    "in fact , when one begins to understand the details , the entire picture suggests difficulties very much like those in @xmath985 again .",
    "we have just one more remark of a general nature , before we proceed to review all these matters in more detail .",
    "one of the reasons that the garside approach to the conjugacy problem is interesting is because the techniques that were developed for the braid groups revealed unexpected structures in @xmath0 that generalize to related unexpected structures in artin groups ( see @xmath5[subsection : artin groups ] ) , and in the less well - known class of ` garside groups ' .",
    "see @xmath5 [ subsection : generalization : from bbn to garside groups ] .",
    "there has been major activity in recent years regarding these structures , and there are also many open problems .",
    "the same can also be said for the thurston approach , as it too generalizes from an action of @xmath0 on the n - times punctured disc to actions of mapping class groups on curves on surfaces , discussed in @xmath5[subsection : the conjugacy problem : the dynamic approach ] .",
    "all of these matters , and other related ones , will be discussed below .",

    "a key fact which was observed by garside in @xcite is that the presentation ( [ equation : classical presentation ] ) not only defines the group @xmath0 , it also defines a monoid @xmath987 .",
    "he then went on to prove that this monoid embeds in the obvious natural way in @xmath0 , in the strong sense that two positive words in @xmath0 define the same element of @xmath0 if and only if they also define the same element in the monoid @xmath987 .",
    "the monoid of positive braids is particularly useful in studying @xmath0 because the defining relations all preserve word length , so that the number of candidates for a positive word which represents a positive braid is finite .",
    "however , all this is of little use unless we can show that the monoid of positive braids is more than just a small and very special subset of @xmath0 . in ( g3 ) below we show that this is indeed the case .",

    "a key observation is that there are @xmath31 braids in @xmath1020 , and that these braids are in 1 - 1 correspondence with the permutations of their end - points , under the correspondence defined by sending each @xmath36 to the transposition @xmath1022 .",

    "to understand the importance of this fact , we note that any positive 5-braid in which 2 strands cross at most once , whose associated permutation is @xmath1023 must be @xmath1018 , a criterion which is an enormous improvement over searching through the 768 distinct positive words that the hook length formula showed us represent @xmath1018 , giving a good idea of the simplification that adyan , thurston and elrifai and morton discovered .",
    "the final step in finding a very rapid solution to the word problem in @xmath0 is a unique way to factorize the braid @xmath612 in the partial normal form @xmath1024 of ( g4 ) above as a unique product of finitely many permutation braids .",
