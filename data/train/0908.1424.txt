    "the so - called ` tidal dwarf galaxies ' ( tdg ) , concentrations of interstellar gas and stars in the tidal features of interacting galaxies that may become independent dwarf galaxies , have been the subject of intense scrutiny ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the ` smoking gun ' that will unambiguously prove the tdg hypothesis is the discovery of independent dwarf galaxies that are detached from other galaxies , but have clear tidal histories .    as part of a search for tdgs and to study star formation in tidal features , we have used the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( galex ) telescope @xcite to conduct a large uv imaging survey of interacting galaxies selected from the arp  ( 1996 ) atlas .",
    "we have found a number of previously unstudied candidate tdgs in our sample ( @xcite , also see b. smith et al .",
    ", this conference proceedings ) .    in this proceedings we present results from @xcite on the interacting galaxy pair arp 305 ( ngc 4016/7 ) .",
    "we have obtained uv and optical images of arp 305 from the galex , sloan digitized sky survey ( sdss ) , and the southeastern association for research in astronomy ( sara ) telescopes .",
    "arp 305 is a very wide pair with the primary galaxy , ngc 4017 , to the south and the companion , ngc 4016 , to the north .",
    "ngc 4017 appears nearly face - on , with two tidal tails , one pointing northwest and one to the southeast .",
    "the uv images show much extended emission to the northwest and southeast far outside the main disk @xcite .",
    "the primary seems to have an ocular waveform , a bright oval of star formation shaped like an eyelid ( e.g. @xcite )    the northern galaxy , ngc 4016 , shows a misshapen bulge with a dusty disk . in the inner disk , a curious figure - eight shape",
    "is seen @xcite .",
    "we suspect that the figure - eight formation is the result of a bar ( see the third frame of figure 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite noted that this galaxy pair showed scattered debris resembling dwarf galaxies .",
    "the most prominent debris is seen in a partial residual bridge between the two spiral galaxies .",
    "this feature is particularly striking in the galex images ( figure 1 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we will adopt the name ` bridge tdg ' for the tidal dwarf candidate in the residual bridge .",
    "with sara , we have detected h@xmath0  emission from this feature confirming that it is at the same redshift as the galaxies .",
    "this structure is clearly detected in hi @xcite , further suggesting that it is part of the arp 305 system .",
    "we have identified 45 star forming clumps in arp 305 from the galex fuv images .",
    "the bridge tdg contains four of these clumps ( figure 1 ) .",
    "two additional detached tdg candidates northeast and southwest of ngc 4016 are also marked in figure 1 .    to estimate the ages of the star forming clumps we compared various color combinations to sets of starburst99 ( sb99 ) models @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for details on the sb99 models and the age determinations .",
    "we do not see any old clumps in this system in spite of the fact that the last closest encounter was about 300 myr ago .",
    "perhaps this is the result of cluster dissolution or the so called cluster ` infant mortality ' ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , this could be a selection effect .",
    "we selected the clumps from the fuv image so have chosen the youngest clumps .",
    "another possibility is our limited resolution .",
    "it is likely that the clumps are made up of several unresolved clusters and/or associations .",
    "the light in our photometric apertures would be dominated by the younger clusters .",
    "the absence of intermediate age clumps in the tidal structures of arp 305 and some other systems ( e.g , arp 82 and arp 285 ; @xcite ) indicates that it is difficult to make long - lived tdgs .",
    "the bridge tdg looks to be embedded in a massive hi plume stretching north from the primary @xcite .",
    "the stars in the bridge tdg most likely formed in situ .",
    "the distance between the nucleus of the primary and the bridge tdg is @xmath1 kpc .",
    "the clumps in the bridge tdg are an average of 19 myr old . to travel 36 kpc in 19 myr the material would have to travel at a velocity of roughly 2000 km s@xmath2  relative to the primary .",
    "the hi kinematics do not support this @xcite .",
    "we estimate that the combined stellar mass for the clumps in the bridge tdg is @xmath3@xmath4 .",
    "these clump masses are consistent with that of galactic globular clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) and super star clusters ( ssc ) ( e.g. @xcite ) . for comparison ,",
    "the tdg candidates in @xcite have stellar masses around 2@xmath5@xmath4  to 3@xmath6@xmath4 .",
    "the hi mass of the bridge tdg is @xmath7@xmath4   consistent with the 29 low mass dwarfs studied in @xcite ( @xmath8@xmath4 ) .",
    "the hi mass / luminosity ratio for the bridge tdg is m@xmath9/l(b)@xmath10 m@xmath11/l@xmath11 , similar to those of irregular and compact blue dwarfs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the bridge tdg has an h@xmath0  luminosity of @xmath12 erg s@xmath2 , similar to the h@xmath0  luminosities of the dwarfs in @xcite and the tidal features studied by @xcite .",
    "there are two other tdg candidates in arp 305 . to the southwest of ngc 4016",
    "is a bright clump ( figure 1 ) , that appears to be at the tip of a faint tidal arm .",
    "this clump is bright in both the galex uv and all the sdss optical bands and is within the extended hi envelope @xcite .",
    "it is not detected in our continuum subtracted h@xmath0  images .",
    "this tdg candidate is the oldest clump in our sample .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that this object is a foreground star or a background object .    to the northeast",
    "is another possible tdg .",
    "the northern tail of ngc 4016 points toward this clump .",
    "this tdg candidate is also bright in both the galex uv and all the sdss optical bands , and is not detected in our continuum subtracted h@xmath0  images .",
    "figure 1 shows this northern tdg candidate to be an extended object with an appearance similar to an inclined disk .",
    "given this , the lack of an h@xmath0  detection , and the large distance from ngc 4016 ( @xmath13 kpc ) , we can not rule out the possibility that this is a background galaxy .",
    "near the bases of both the northeastern and southwestern tidal tails in ngc 4017 are extremely luminous clumps .",
    "these ` hinge clumps ' likely form when material is pulled out from deeper in the original disk .",
    "this material , gas with higher initial densities , is more compressed .",
    "moreover , being pulled out in a tail likely reduces the shear levels of the original disk , allowing self - gravity to more easily form big clouds . the `",
    "hinge clumps ' are the two brightest uv clumps in the primary and are very bright in h@xmath0 . a luminous ` hinge clump '",
    "was also observed in arp 82 at the base of the long extended northern tail @xcite .      what is the long term fate of the clusters that do survive , and do any of those that might represent tdgs detach in some sense ?",
    "we have investigated those questions by running numerical simulations .",
    "we used the sph code of @xcite .",
    "this code was also used to model other systems recently ( e.g. arp 284 , @xcite ; ic 2163/ngc 2207 , @xcite ; arp 107 , @xcite ; arp 82 , @xcite ; and arp 285 , @xcite ) .",
    "the tdg particle in figure 2 turned on sf at a time and place like that of the bridge tdg in the observations , and might illustrate the fate of the bridge tdg . if so , that fate is to be captured by the companion and carried into the merger .",
    "it seems very unlikely that tdgs formed in the bridge will detach and survive the merger .",
    "the models suggest the eventual merger is about 1.3 gyr from the time depicted in figure 2 .",
    "the bridge tdg could persist for this long , consistent with recent results . in their extensive n - body study of tidal dwarf formation",
    "@xcite found that 75% of the dwarf candidates fell back into the galaxies within a few @xmath6 yr .",
    "the remaining 25% had a typical lifetime of more than 2 gyr .",
    "most of the later formed in the outer parts of tidal tails .",
    "however , we are not sure if the bridge tdg is currently bound",
    ". we do nt know whether it will survive the first and subsequent fall backs .",
    "we present results from @xcite on the candidate tdgs in the interacting galaxy pair arp 305 ( ngc 4016/7 ) .",
    "a prominent tdg candidate is seen in a partial residual bridge between the two spiral galaxies .",
    "we summarize the bridge tdg analysis below :    * mean age@xmath1419 myr , e(b - v)@xmath140.06 * stars formed in situ * total stellar mass of the 4 clumps @xmath3@xmath4 * total hi mass @xmath7 @xmath4 * mass more similar to sscs or perhaps a small tdg * has a clear tidal history * it is not clear if the tdg is a single bound object * unlikely to permanently detach and survive the merger * could persist for @xmath15 gyr    this research was supported by nasa ltsa grant nag5 - 13079 and galex grant galexgi04 - 0000 - 0026 .",
