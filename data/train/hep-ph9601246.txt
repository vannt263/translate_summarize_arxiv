    "instanton effects seem to be outstandingly reflected in properties of scalar and pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "an interaction induced by instantons @xcite solves naturally the @xmath2 problem for the @xmath3 masses in the pseudoscalar sector @xcite . in the framework of a relativistic quark model ,",
    "this interaction acting on scalar mesons has been suggested to explain quantitatively the unusual mass spectrum of scalar mesons roughly in terms of a low lying singlet and a higher lying octet of @xmath4-states @xcite . their peculiar strong decay pattern ,",
    "however , has not yet been consistently described .",
    "in particular the @xmath0 @xcite was argued to have properties incompatible with a pure @xmath5 configuration and it was suggested to possess a large glue admixture @xcite .",
    "one of the major arguments in favor of this interpretation is the decay phenomenology of the @xmath0 : it is found to decay into @xmath6 @xcite but not into @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath5 hypothesis can not fit _ all _ of these branching ratios at any @xmath8 scalar mixing angle , when decaying through a conventional decay mechanism ( see fig.[fig : decay.pstex_t ] in @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore the full width @xmath9  mev is out of line with the scalar nonet : taking the widths @xmath10  mev and @xmath11  mev as a scale for the other members of the scalar nonet , a natural guess for the @xmath12 is around 500 mev .",
    "the @xmath0 thus does not naturally fit into the quarkonium nonet .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the contribution of an instanton induced six - quark - vertex to the strong decay of scalar mesons into pseudoscalars .",
    "we derive @xmath8 branching ratios for the scalar octet , in particular for the @xmath0 , which allow for a region of the scalar mixing angle fulfilling all of the three experimental branching ratios .",
    "we also present results of a numerical calculation in the framework of a relativistic quark model @xcite .",
    "the flavor dependent effective quark interaction used here was computed by t hooft and others from instanton effects @xcite .",
    "t hooft showed that an expansion of the ( euclidian ) action around the one instanton solution of the gauge fields assuming dominance of the zero modes of the fermion fields leads to an effective quark interaction not covered by perturbative gluon exchange . for three flavors",
    "this is a six - point quark vertex completely antisymmetric in flavor .",
    "after normal ordering this results in a contribution to the constituent quark masses , a two body interaction and a six quark term that can be written as @xcite : @xmath13          { \\cal p}^f_1 ( 2{\\cal p}^c_{10}+5{\\cal p}^c_8 )         \\psi(y ) \\psi(y ) \\psi(y)\\ ! :        \\bigr\\ }     \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the projector onto a three - particle flavor singlet state , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are projectors onto the color decuplet and the color octet and @xmath17 is an effective coupling constant @xcite .",
    "the dots imply that the first dirac operator acts on the first quark field and so forth . because of the special dirac structure the adequate formulation for this lagrangian is the weyl representation for the dirac spinors @xmath18 with diagonal @xmath19 .",
    "+ the antisymmetric part of the operator acting on the three fermion fields is given by the product of the antisymmetric flavor projector and a projector which is symmetric in spin and color .",
    "the only possible symmetric spin - color operators are realized by the combinations : @xmath20 with @xmath21 the projector on the spin quadruplet and @xmath22 the projector on the spin doublet .",
    "the interaction lagrangian then can be written in terms of the weyl spinors as : @xmath23 we want to calculate the contribution of ( [ thooft ] ) to the decay amplitude of one meson into two mesons . in the present framework mesons are described as bound @xmath1-states with a bs - amplitude @xcite @xmath24 it can be shown ( see below ) that the six - quark - interaction ( [ thooft ] ) due to its pointlike nature only applies to spin zero states i.e. mesons with nonvanishing bethe ",
    "salpeter amplitudes at the origin proportional to @xmath19 ( for pseudoscalars ) or @xmath25 ( for scalars ) .",
    "thus the only relevant quantities for each meson are : @xmath26 moreover the parity transformation relates these quantities : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the parity of the meson . the amplitude given in ( [ zwe ] )",
    "can be decomposed in a product of space , flavor , spin and color part : @xmath29 the full contraction of the six - point green s function @xmath30    according to wick s theorem leads to the transition matrix element in lowest order for the decay process : @xmath31     \\ ; \\ ;   tr\\bigl [ ( 2{\\cal p}_{1}+5{\\cal p}_2 ) \\ , \\bigotimes_{j=1}^3 \\",
    ",    ( \\sigma_j \\otimes { \\cal c}_j ) \\bigr]\\ ] ] where @xmath32 = { \\cal o}^{\\alpha_1 \\alpha_2 \\alpha_3 \\beta_1 \\beta_2 \\beta_3 }    \\ ; \\chi^1_{\\alpha_1 \\beta_1 } \\ ; \\chi^2_{\\alpha_2 \\beta_2 } \\ ;   \\chi^3_{\\alpha_3 \\beta_3}\\ ] ] the second trace is non - vanishing only if all mesons have spin zero .",
    "it can easily be calculated , since the mesons are color singlet states , and yields a factor @xmath33 ( color matrices are normalized by a factor @xmath34 ) . in the following section we will investigate the flavor dependence of ( [ uberg ] ) .",
    "the explicit flavor dependence in the notation of equation ( [ not ] ) is : @xmath35 with @xmath36 the flavor part of the meson amplitude j. with the cayley - hamilton theorem this can be written as : @xmath37_+ ) -   ( tr({\\cal f}^1)tr({\\cal f}^2 { \\cal f}^2)+\\hbox{cycl})+ tr({\\cal f}^1)tr({\\cal f}^2)tr({\\cal f}^3)\\ ] ] the first term is recognized as the flavor dependence of the conventional quark line diagram ( according to the ozi rule ) of fig 1a ) . defining @xmath38 as the traceless part of @xmath39",
    "we obtain : @xmath37_+ ) -   ( tr({\\cal f}^1)tr(\\widehat{{\\cal f}^2 } \\;\\widehat{{\\cal f}^2})+\\hbox{cycl})\\ ] ] the flavor dependence of the three - body interaction thus leads to a minimal violation of the ozi rule : only if @xmath40 does not vanish , i.e. a flavor singlet participates , there is an additional contribution to the conventional decay mechanism given by the first term .    with a pseudoscalar mixing angle @xmath41 for the @xmath42-system @xcite we find the following partial widths ( normalized to @xmath43 ) in the su(3 ) limit : @xmath44    let us now consider the decay properties of the @xmath45 , @xmath46 system .",
    "we parameterize the mixing of the singlet and octet @xmath45 as @xmath47 the partial widths of the @xmath46 are plotted in fig.[fig : fnulzerfall.pstex_t ] as a function of the scalar mixing angle @xmath48 . with an angle of @xmath49",
    "we find the following partial widths ( normalized as in ( [ akst ] ) ) : @xmath50 this is in fair agreement with the observed partial widths of the @xmath0 @xcite : @xmath51 if phase space and a form factor is divided out and the @xmath52-width is normalized .",
    "it is interesting that in a relativistic quark model based on the same instanton induced quark - antiquark force @xcite we also find a small positive mixing angle although the numerical value @xmath53 is somewhat smaller .",
    "though in this su(3 ) model the total width of the @xmath46 is expected to be about as large as that of the @xmath54 this is still too large to explain the remarkable small width of @xmath9  mev @xcite .",
    "the transition matrix elements for a scalar to two pseudoscalars have also been calculated in the framework of a relativistic quark model based on the salpeter equation , for details see @xcite . there the mixing angle of the scalar states is found to be @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "as it stands , the instanton - induced interaction is point - like .",
    "we regularized the interaction by replacing the delta function by a normalized gaussian function , which introduces a finite effective range @xcite .",
    "the calculation uses all parameters as given in @xcite and the calculated masses from this model .",
    "our results for the partial widths are given in table [ tab ] , where we have adjusted the six - quark coupling strength @xmath17 to the process @xmath56 .",
    "again , the small @xmath0 total width can not be accounted for .",
    "we infer that in future work we have to include also the conventional decay mechanism of fig .",
    "the interference between both terms may well solve the remaining problems of the scalar decay modes .    for the @xmath54 the particle data group @xcite lists one decay mode @xmath56 within @xmath57 .",
    "our calculated result ( @xmath58 ) is still compatible with this number .",
    "for the @xmath59 there are two listed strong decay modes : @xmath60 within @xmath61 and @xmath62 within @xmath63 .",
    "our results , 60% and 40% respectively are still in fair agreement .    in the following we compare the invariant couplings for the @xmath0 , i.e. the branching ratios divided by phase space factors : @xmath64 the experimentally seen invariant couplings @xcite are : @xmath65 the clear discrepancy ( for the @xmath66 channel ) is mainly due to the small calculated scalar mixing angle @xmath55 .",
    "the decay mechanism via the six - quark - vertex thus can not explain the experimentally seen branching ratios alone .",
    "the conventional contribution has to be added coherently .",
    "it is interesting to note that the calculated invariant coupling @xmath67 indicates that the @xmath68-channel is relevant for the decay of the @xmath0 .",
    "in this paper an instanton induced six - point vertex has been worked out which contributes to the strong decay of scalar mesons into two pseudoscalars . using a @xmath8 mixing angle @xmath69 for the @xmath70 system , the experimental branching ratios of the @xmath0 can be explained in a @xmath8 symmetric calculation in contrast to a mechanism via a conventional quark line diagram .",
    "the small total width of the @xmath0 , however , has not yet been explained in the su(3 ) calculation nor in a relativistic quark model . it should be emphasized that none of the parameters was adjusted to the scalar spectrum , and some improvement",
    "might be obtained by changing slightly the strength of the instanton - induced force .",
    "in addition there is no logical argument which rules out the conventional decay mechanism .",
    "actually the latter still should account for all other meson decays , since the contribution discussed here only works for ( pseudo)scalars .",
    "therefore in the future the interference between the conventional and the instanton - induced six - quark vertex has to be worked out quantitatively .",
