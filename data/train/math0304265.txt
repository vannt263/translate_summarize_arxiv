    "<S> in recent years , we have established the iteration theory of the index for symplectic matrix paths and applied it to periodic solution problems of nonlinear hamiltonian systems . </S>",
    "<S> this paper is a survey on these results .    </S>",
    "<S> 4.5 mm    * 2000 mathematics subject classification : * 58e05 , 70h05 , 34c25 .    * keywords and phrases : * iteration theory , index , symplectic path , hamiltonian system , periodic orbit .    since p. rabinowitz s pioneering work @xcite of 1978 , variational methods have been widely used in the study of existence of solutions of hamiltonian systems . but how to study the geometric multiplicity and stability of periodic solution orbits obtained by variational methods has kept to be a difficulty problem </S>",
    "<S> . for example let @xmath0 be a @xmath1-periodic solution of a hamiltonian system @xmath2 the @xmath3-th iteration @xmath4 of @xmath5 is defined by induction @xmath6 times via @xmath7 for @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> it runs @xmath3-times along the orbit of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> geometrically these iterations produce the same solution orbit of ( [ 1 ] ) , but they are different as critical points of corresponding functionals . </S>",
    "<S> this multiple covering phenomenon causes major difficulties in the study .    </S>",
    "<S> a natural way to study solution orbits found by variational methods is to study the morse - type index sequences of their iterations . </S>",
    "<S> but when one studies general hamiltonian systems , the morse indices of the critical points of the corresponding functional are always infinite . to overcome this difficulty , in their celebrated paper @xcite of 1984 , c. conley and e. zehnder defined an index theory for any non - degenerate paths in @xmath9 with @xmath10 , i.e. , the so called conley - zehnder index theory . </S>",
    "<S> this index theory was further defined for non - degenerate paths in @xmath11 by e. zehnder and the author in @xcite of 1990 . the index theory for degenerate linear hamiltonian systems </S>",
    "<S> was defined by c. viterbo in @xcite and the author in @xcite of 1990 independently . in @xcite of 1997 , </S>",
    "<S> this index was extended to any degenerate symplectic matrix paths .    motivated by the iteration theories for the morse type index theories established by r. bott in 1956 and by i. ekeland in 1980s , in recent years the author extended the index theory mentioned above , introduced an index function theory for symplectic matrix paths , and established the iteration theory for the index theory of symplectic paths . </S>",
    "<S> applying this index iteration theory to nonlinear hamiltonian systems , interesting results on periodic solution problems of hamiltonian systems are obtained . here a brief survey is given on these subjects . </S>",
    "<S> readers are referred to the author s recent book @xcite for further details . </S>"
