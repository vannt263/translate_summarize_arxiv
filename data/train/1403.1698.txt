    "quantum memory is , in a wide sense , a device that stores or freezes a quantum state both spatially and in time .",
    "a highly successful example is that a light pulse is frozen in a cloud of atoms @xcite .",
    "also quantum memory is of technological importance particularly in quantum information science , such as the quantum repeater for quantum communication @xcite . because of these scientific / technological importance",
    ", the field of quantum memory has experienced significant progress in both theory and experiment .",
    "we refer to for instance @xcite for reviewing the current situation of this very active research area .",
    "basic schematic of an ideal quantum memory .",
    "@xmath0 denotes the mode of the memory subsystem used for the storage , while @xmath1 is the mode of the buffer subsystem , which transports the input state to ( from ) the memory subsystem from ( to ) the optical field with mode @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the system structure can be switched from the stage ( a ) to ( b ) , or from ( b ) to ( c ) , by tuning some controllable parameters . in the stage ( b ) , @xmath0 is decoupled from @xmath1 and thus the optical field , implying that @xmath0 is decoherence free . in the stages ( a ) and ( c ) , on the other hand , @xmath0 couples to the field for state transportation . ]    now let us see a basic and general schematic of an ideal quantum memory in an abstract way .",
    "first of all , we assume that the system contains a subsystem that can store any quantum state without loss in a long period of time ; we call this specific component the _ memory subsystem_. ideally , the memory subsystem should be completely decoupled from the other system components and surrounding environment during it stores the state ; i.e. , it is _ decoherence free ( df ) _ @xcite . note that , in this storage stage , the memory subsystem is decoupled even from the channel used for transferring an input state or retrieving the stored state .",
    "hence , the second assumption is that , during the writing / reading process , the system can be tuned so that the memory subsystem couples to that transportation channel .",
    "that is , the system should be the one that contains a tunable port switching the opening / closing of the memory subsystem .",
    "indeed this basic schematic is employed in each specific memory device . in the case of atoms based on the electromagnetic induced transparency ( eit ) effect ,",
    "an isolated memory subsystem is served by a set of metastable collective atomic states , and an external control field ( with rabi frequency @xmath4 ) can switch on / off of the coupling between the metastable states and the optical field for state transportation @xcite .",
    "we also find successful demonstrations in optical cavity or optomechanical oscillator arrays @xcite , where the switching mechanism is served by adiabatic frequency detuning of the memory subsystem .",
    "further , a similar switching procedure is employed in the photon echo quantum memory @xcite .",
    "note that , if the system does not contain a switching mechanism , it is generally impossible to perfectly transfer an unknown state to a memory subsystem ( i.e. df subsystem ) @xcite .",
    "the above - mentioned basic schematic for quantum memory is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ df memory schematic ] . in the writing stage ( a )",
    ", an input state is sent to the system over an input channel with mode @xmath5 .",
    "let us here assume that , by devising a  certain nice procedure \" , all the input state is transferred to the memory subsystem with mode @xmath0 .",
    "we then close the port , and @xmath0 becomes decoherence free . in this storage stage ( b ) , ideally , the memory subsystem can store the state for a long time . finally , in the reading stage ( c ) , by opening again the port we can retrieve the state at any later time , which is sent over the output channel with mode @xmath6 .",
    "so what is a  certain nice procedure \" to achieve the best or hopefully perfect state transfer ?",
    "for some typical quantum memories such as eit and off - resonant raman memories , we can explicitly formulate this problem ; that is , the question is what is the optimal temporal shape of the pulsed light field carrying the input state .",
    "this optimization problem is very important and actually has been deeply investigated in several papers ; for instance , towards the most efficient atomic memory with eit , in @xcite the input wave packet as well as the controllable rabi frequency @xmath4 ( see the second paragraph ) are carefully designed , although the method is a heuristic one based on iterative tuning of the parameters .",
    "it is also notable that the so - called _ rising exponential _",
    "type function is found as an effective pulse shape @xcite .",
    "this is a pulse with exponential increase of e.g. the probability density of photon counting or the amplitude of a coherent field , which can be physically implemented @xcite .",
    "motivated by these results and further the fact that a large - scale quantum memory is required for constructing practical quantum communication architecture , the following questions naturally arise .",
    "is there a pulse shape for achieving perfect state transfer for general and large - scale quantum memory networks ?",
    "is there a general yet simple guideline for synthesizing such desirable pulse shape ?",
    "what is the fundamental origin of the rising exponential function as a desirable pulse shape ? is the rising exponential pulse optimal in a certain sense ?",
    "also , is it effective even for a large - scale network ? solving these problems should accelerate the progress of the quantum memory research in its deeper understanding and practical implementation .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a general _ passive linear system _ , which models a wide variety of systems such as optical systems @xcite , nano - mechanical oscillators @xcite , vibration mode of a trapped particle @xcite , and atomic ensembles @xcite . as mentioned before , the system is assumed to contain a tunable memory subsystem ; that is , by tuning a certain parameter , we can switch opening / closing of the memory subsystem , which is df during the storage period . note that in our case this df subsystem corresponds to a system having the so - called _ dark mode _ @xcite .",
    "another assumption is that an unknown input state to be transferred is encoded in a continuos - mode single - photon field or a coherent field . with these setups ,",
    "we give answers to all the questions posed in the above paragraph .",
    "the essential idea is the use of _ zero - dynamics principle_. this concept originates from the classical notion of  zero \" of a _ transfer function _ , which is a fundamental tool used in systems and control theory @xcite .",
    "more precisely , for a general linear classical system @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the input , @xmath9 is the output , and @xmath10 are matrices , its input - output relation is simply characterized by a transfer function @xmath11=d+c(si - a)^{-1}b$ ] as @xmath12=h[s]u[s]$ ] ( see section  4.3 for detailed description ) ; then , if the input is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a _ zero _ of the transfer function ( meaning @xmath15=0 $ ] ) , we have @xmath16e^{zt } = 0 $ ] under some additional conditions .",
    "that is , the _ zero - dynamics _ is a system whose output is always zero .",
    "in fact , the concept of zero - dynamics is very important in analysis and synthesis for even general nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "actually , the zero - dynamics principle described above can be directly applied to general quantum memory problem ; if the state transfer is perfectly carried out , the input field must be completely absorbed in the system , and the output field must not contain any small pieces of the input field .",
    "that is , as a principle , the output should be  zero \" during the writing and storage stages .",
    "surprisingly , this simple zero - dynamics principle leads us to prove , very easily , that a rising exponential function is a unique pulse shape achieving the perfect state transfer for general ( and thus large - scale ) linear passive networks .",
    "moreover , based on this first main result , we give an explicit , simple , and general procedure for designing the wave packet carrying an unknown state that is as a result perfectly absorbed in the memory subsystem .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 provides some preliminaries , describing general passive linear systems , optical field states , and linear df subsystems .",
    "also the problem is explicitly formulated in section  2.4 . in section  3",
    ", we study a simple single - mode oscillator as a memory system , to show the fact that a rising exponential function appears as a unique pulse shape achieving the perfect state transfer ; based on this result , the idea of zero - dynamics principle is discussed .",
    "section  4 provides our first main result ; for general passive linear systems , we derive the rising exponential pulse from the zero - dynamics principle .",
    "also we give a useful interpretation of this fact in terms of the transfer function . in section  5 ,",
    "we present our second main result , showing the concrete procedure for perfect writing , storage , and reading ; this explicitly shows the pulse shape to be synthesized for perfect state transfer from the optical field to the memory subsystem .",
    "section  6 is devoted to derive the time evolution equations of some statistical quantities of the dynamics , which is useful for numerical simulation . in section  7",
    ", we study a linear network composed of atomic ensembles trapped in a cavity , which contains a tunable memory subsystem ; this example shows how the designed pulse actually looks like and how the state transfer from the optical field to the atomic ensembles evolves in time .",
    "section  8 summarize the paper and discusses some future works . in appendix",
    "a , we briefly examine the case of an _ active _ linear memory system .",
    "appendix  b provides a case study comparing the zero - dynamics principle and the so - called _ dark state principle_.    * notation : * we use the following notations : for a matrix @xmath17 , the symbols @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 represent its hermitian conjugate , transpose , and complex conjugation in elements of @xmath21 , respectively ; i.e. , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . for a matrix of operators we use the same notation , in which case @xmath25",
    "denotes the adjoint to @xmath26 . for a time - dependent variable @xmath27",
    ", we denote @xmath28 .",
    "in this paper , we study a general linear open system composed of @xmath29 oscillators with mode @xmath30^\\top$ ] that couples to an optical field with continuous mode @xmath5 ; hence they satisfy @xmath31=\\delta_{ij}$ ] and @xmath32=\\delta(s - t)$ ] .",
    "the system is driven by a quadratic hamiltonian @xmath33 with @xmath34 an @xmath29-dimensional hermitian matrix .",
    "the system and the field instantaneously couple through the interaction hamiltonian @xmath35 $ ] with @xmath36 an @xmath29-dimensional complex _ row _ vector .",
    "then the unitary operator @xmath37\\ ] ] ( @xmath38 is the initial time ) produces the heisenberg equations of @xmath39 and @xmath40 as follows ; @xmath41 where @xmath42^\\top$ ] and @xmath43 .",
    "the second term in @xmath21 stems from the ito - correction .",
    "note also that , due to the ideal markov property , the optical field @xmath5 does not have its own dynamical time evolution ; rather @xmath6 represents the output of the system .",
    "the above open system with input @xmath5 and output @xmath6 is called the _ passive linear system _ in the sense that it does not contain any active component such as an optical parametric amplifier in optics case .",
    "as mentioned in section  1 , a passive linear system can model a wide variety of systems .",
    "the main reason why we focus on this class of general systems is that it preserves the total energy during the interaction between the system and the field .",
    "this implies that the perfect state transfer is equivalent to the perfect energy transfer , which as a result allows us to use the zero - dynamics principle to characterize the perfect memory ; this will be discussed in detail in section  4 .",
    "also in appendix  a , we show a brief case study where the system contains an active component . for a general treatment of passive linear systems , see @xcite ; the notation used in this paper follow these references , where in general @xmath36 is an @xmath44 complex matrix representing @xmath45 input optical fields .      in this paper",
    ", we consider the case where the input is given by a single photon state or a coherent state , which is carried by an optical pulse field with continuous - mode @xmath5 .",
    "they are described as follows .",
    "* single photon field state : * the single photon state in a single mode system is , as is well known , produced by acting a creation operator @xmath46 to the ground state @xmath47 ; i.e. @xmath48 to describe the continuous - mode single photon field state , we define the annihilation and creation process operators @xmath49 @xmath50 is an associated function in @xmath51 , representing the shape of the optical pulse field .",
    "also @xmath50 satisfies the normalization condition @xmath52 . due to this ,",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 satisfy the usual ccr ; @xmath55=1 $ ] .",
    "the single photon field state is , in a similar way as above , produced by acting the creation process operator on the vacuum field @xmath56 as follows @xcite : @xmath57 due to the normalization condition of @xmath50 , we find that @xmath58",
    ". also note the relation @xmath59 ; thus , @xmath50 has the meaning of the wave function with @xmath60 the probability of photo detection per unit time .",
    "let us now assume that the pulse shape @xmath50 can be expanded as @xmath61 the coefficient @xmath62 represents ( unknown ) classical information encoded in the optical field , which satisfies @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is a set of orthonormal functions satisfying @xmath65 note that @xmath29 is the number of modes of the system .",
    "then the single photon field state can be written as @xmath66 @xmath67 is called the single photon code state with pulse shape @xmath68 @xcite ; from the condition , they are orthonormal , i.e. @xmath69 . also the field operator @xmath70 satisfies the ccr @xmath71=\\delta_{jk}$ ] .",
    "* coherent field state : * another important state is a coherent state .",
    "a coherent state in a single mode system is generated by acting a displacement operator @xmath72 on the ground state as follows ; @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the amplitude of @xmath75 .",
    "likewise , a coherent field state is defined in terms of the creation and annihilation process operators as follows ; @xmath76                                          { |{0}\\rangle}_f,\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is a complex - valued function , representing the amplitude of the state ; that is , this is a coherent pulse field modulated with envelope function @xmath77 .",
    "note that @xmath77 is not necessarily normalized , but its power @xmath78 is finite .",
    "now we assume that @xmath77 is given , in terms of the orthonormal functions @xmath64 , by @xmath79 where @xmath80 represents ( unknown ) classical information to be stored .",
    "the power of @xmath81 ,",
    "i.e. the mean photon number in unit time , is then given by @xmath82 .",
    "the coherent field state is as a result described by @xmath83                                          { |{0}\\rangle}_f.\\ ] ] note that this is not a superposition of the coherent field states @xmath84 , unlike the single photon field state .",
    "the general theory of df subsystems states that , if a df subsystem exists , then the system hilbert space @xmath89 is decomposed to @xmath90 , where any observable in @xmath91 evolves unitarily . in our case ,",
    "the decomposition is of the form @xmath92 ; thus the system variables are , more precisely , represented by @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "this special class of continuous - variable df subsystems appears in several situation @xcite . also for a general theory of the linear df subsystem , including a necessary and sufficient condition for a given linear system to have a df mode ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "here we describe the problem discussed throughout the paper .",
    "our system is the general passive linear system , and it is assumed to be tunable ; that is , by appropriate tuning of its parameter(s ) , a part of the system , the memory subsystem , couples or decouples to the optical field carrying the information .",
    "hence the memory subsystem can be switched to be a df or a non - df subsystem . as mentioned in section  2.3 , the memory subsystem stores the state during it is in the df mode , while it should be in the non - df mode when we transfer the input state or retrieve the stored state . in particular , we assume that the matrix @xmath95 in the writing / reading stages is _ hurwitz _ , i.e. , the real parts of all the eigenvalues of @xmath21 are negative ; as will be shown later , this condition is necessary for perfect state transfer . on the other hand , in the storage stage",
    ", the dynamical equation takes the form , thus @xmath21 is not hurwitz .    the field s initial state is given by @xmath96 in the case of single photon input field or @xmath81 in the case of coherent input field . the system s initial state @xmath97 is assumed to be separable , hence it is given by @xmath98 .",
    "in particular , we will set it to be the ground state @xmath99 satisfying @xmath100 .    at time @xmath38 , the system and the field start to interact , via the unitary operator @xmath101 given in eq .  .",
    "the composite state at time @xmath102 is then given by @xmath103 or @xmath104 . in this writing stage ,",
    "the memory subsystem is in the non - df mode , so it couples to the field .",
    "but once the state transfer has been completed , then we switch the system parameters so that the memory subsystem becomes decoherence free , and its state is preserved during the storage stage .",
    "hence , it would be desirable if the state @xmath105 is of the separable form @xmath106 and the memory subsystem s state @xmath107 contains the full information of the input field state @xmath96 or @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , our goal is to appropriately synthesize the pulse shape @xmath50 or @xmath77 , or more precisely their basis functions @xmath64 , so that the above desirable transition from the field s initial state to @xmath107 occurs .",
    "lastly we remark on the switching configuration . in general ,",
    "the system matrices @xmath34 and @xmath36 ( and thus @xmath21 ) can change in time ( i.e. time varying ) in order to realize high quality quantum memory .",
    "for instance in @xcite , the authors consider the time varying system matrices depending on the control field with frequency @xmath4 , which is optimized via a heuristic method . on the other hand , in this paper , we assume that @xmath34 and @xmath36 are time varying , but they are constant in each stage of the memory procedure ; that is , they are _ piecewise constant_. in particular , we will take the same system matrices in the writing and reading stages .",
    "in this section , we examine a simple case where the memory system is given by a single - mode passive linear system . as will be shown later",
    ", this system does not contain a tunable df component , so it does not work as a perfect storage device .",
    "rather the purpose here is that , by focusing only on the writing stage , requiring perfect state transfer uniquely determines the pulse shape of the input optical field .",
    "based on this result , we then derive the explicit form of the output field , and show the notion of zero - dynamics in this case . here",
    "we study only the single - photon input case , but it is straightforward to obtain a similar result in the case of coherent field state .",
    "let us consider the following single - mode ( i.e. @xmath108 ) linear system interacting with an optical field , which is obtained by setting @xmath109 and @xmath110 in eq .",
    ": @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the interaction strength ; in optics case , this system is typically given by an optical cavity with @xmath112 proportional to the transmissivity of the coupling mirror .",
    "the goal is to send a single photon state over the input pulse field and write it perfectly down to the system .",
    "note that , however , clearly this system does not contain a tunable df component , hence our interest here is only in the state transfer .",
    "the input state is given by eq .",
    ", which is now essentially @xmath113 .",
    "thus in this case let us take a superposition of the vacuum and the single photon field state @xmath114 where @xmath115 are the encoded ( unknown ) classical information .",
    "recall that the system s initial state is set to the ground state @xmath116 .",
    "the dynamical equation has the following solution : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the time we stop the interaction .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath119 where @xmath120 note that @xmath121 .",
    "equation   can be further represented as @xmath122 @xmath123 is the field creation operator with pulse shape @xmath124 , which is defined in eq .  ,",
    "and @xmath125 is the unitary operator given in eq .  .",
    "from the above equation we find that , in the limit @xmath126 , the field creation operator @xmath123 is completely mapped to the system creation operator @xmath127 .",
    "this means that the perfect state transfer from the optical pulse field to the system mode can be carried out as shown below . in the schrdinger picture , the whole state at time @xmath118 is given by @xmath128              { |{0}\\rangle}_s{|{0}\\rangle}_f \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{-1.5em }        = u(t_0 , t_1 )            \\big [ \\alpha i_s\\otimes i_f + \\beta i_s\\otimes b^*(\\xi)\\big ]             u^*(t_0 ,",

    "it is clear from the above discussion that the rising exponential is the unique pulse shape for perfect state transfer from the single photon field to the system .",
    "let us further study the final state @xmath135 , where the input pulse shape is now set to @xmath136 it is possible to obtain the explicit solution : @xmath137 where @xmath138 with @xmath139    first , at @xmath133 , we have @xmath140       + \\frac{2\\kappa\\beta}{\\kappa+\\gamma}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\kappa } }            { |{1}\\rangle}_s{|{0}\\rangle}_f,\\ ] ] which becomes @xmath141 only when @xmath142 .",
    "that is , the frequency bandwidth of the input pulse shape has to be exactly equal to that of the memory system to attain the perfect state transfer .",
    "this is a form of the so - called _ impedance matching _ for efficient energy transfer ; in section 7 , we will discuss the matching condition in a more practical setup where the system is composed of a cavity and atomic ensembles .",
    "next , in the limit @xmath143 , the whole state again becomes separable : @xmath144 where @xmath145 this @xmath146 represents the pulse shape of the output optical field over the whole period .",
    "hence , if @xmath142 , the output field is vacuum in the writing stage @xmath147 ; this means that the single photon input field is completely absorbed into the system , and the output field does not contain any pieces of the input state . in the optics case where the system is given by a cavity , a physical meaning of",
    "this fact is that it happens destructive interference between the light field reflected at the coupling mirror and the transmissive light field leaking from the cavity ; as a result , the output field of the cavity is always in vacuum , i.e.  zero \" , while the system s state still dynamically changes in time . in general , the dynamics of a system whose output is always zero is called the zero dynamics @xcite . hence in this case",
    "the cavity dynamics during the writing process is exactly a zero dynamics .",
    "in this section , based on the so - called energy - balanced identity , we show the notion of zero - dynamics principle as a guideline for perfect state transfer in general passive linear systems .",
    "then , we prove that the zero - dynamics principle readily leads to the rising exponential function as a unique pulse shape .",
    "further , a useful view of the zero - dynamics principle in terms of the transfer function is provided .",
    "note that the zero - dynamics principle is essentially equivalent to the so - called _ dark state principle _ ; this idea was first employed in @xcite for the application to a lossless node - to - node state transfer in a cavity qed network , and later several applications have been developed , e.g. lossless gate operation @xcite .",
    "appendix  b provides a detailed case study comparing the zero - dynamics principle and the dark state principle and then discusses their difference .",
    "first we remark that the pulse shape of the single - photon input field , @xmath50 , and that of the output field , say @xmath146 , can be connected through a dynamical equation having the same form as eq .  .",
    "actually , by multiplying @xmath148 by eq .",

    "note that @xmath153 does not have a particular physical meaning , unlike the vector @xmath154 appearing just below .",
    "the same classical dynamical equation holds for the case of coherent input field ; noting that @xmath155 , we readily see that the vector of mean amplitudes , @xmath156^\\top$ ] with @xmath157 , follows @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the amplitude of the output field @xmath6 .",

    "@xcite holds : @xmath160 this indicates that the total energy contained in the system and the field is preserved for all time . indeed , from eq .",
    "we immediately have @xmath161 where the mean is taken for the state @xmath162 .",

    "we need some approximation ; in the above case , if @xmath112 is much bigger than @xmath348 , then the system state becomes approximately the desired one to be stored .",
    "another example is found in @xcite , where the system is an atomic ensemble containing an active component , but by introducing a fast oscillating magnetic field it is approximated by a passive one , which was further shown to be a perfect memory .",
    "the basic idea of dark state principle is as follows . for a system coupled to a probe field",
    ", we continuously monitor the system by a photo detector measuring the output field ; then if the detector counts no photon , this means that the system is in a _ dark state _ and has a time evolution without loss of energy .",
    "here we apply this dark state principle to the writing problem discussed in section  3 and derive the same result ; that is , in this sense , the zero - dynamics principle and the dark state principle are equivalent , though there is a big difference in practice as shown below .",
    "first let us consider the case where we want to send a coherent field state to the system .",
    "in general , if we use a photon counter to estimate the system observables , our state ( knowledge ) conditioned on the measurement results is updated by the following stochastic master equation @xcite ( the scattering operator is now set to be the identity ) : @xmath357\\alpha + [ l , \\rho]\\alpha^*\\big)dt         + \\big [ \\frac{1}{\\cal n }                        ( l\\rho l^ * + \\alpha^*l\\rho + \\alpha \\rho l^ * + |\\alpha|^2\\rho )                      - \\rho \\big ]                 ( dy - { \\cal n}dt),\\ ] ] where @xmath358                      + l\\rho l^ * - l^ * l\\rho/2 - \\rho l^ * l/2,~~       { \\cal n } = \\tr\\big [ \\rho\\big(l^*l + \\alpha^*l              + \\alpha l^ * + |\\alpha|^2\\big ) \\big].\\ ] ] @xmath359 is the pulse shape of the input coherent light field and @xmath360 is the measurement result ( 0 or 1 ) obtained during the small time interval @xmath361 .",
    "also @xmath362 and @xmath363 are the system operators .",
    "now since the ensemble averaging over the measurement results leads to a standard master equation , we have @xmath364 .",
    "then , the counting probability of the measurement result  1 \" during @xmath361 is given by @xmath365 . hence if @xmath366 , the system is in a dark state and loses no energy into the output field ; the state satisfying this condition is called the dark state . in our case where the system is the single - mode passive linear system with @xmath367 and @xmath368 , the dark state can be specified to a coherent state @xmath369 because we now know that the system s state is always a coherent state .",
    "the condition @xmath370 then becomes @xmath371 , which yields @xmath372 .",
    "now , under the dark state condition the time evolution of the conditional state is identical to that of the averaged one , which consequently leads to @xmath373 .",
    "these two equations yield @xmath374 , thus the input pulse shape must be a rising exponential function @xmath375 .",
    "next let us consider the case where the input is a single photon field state .",
    "as in the above case , the dark state principle is represented in terms of the conditional state subjected to the single - photon stochastic master equation ; see eq .",
    "( 43 ) in @xcite . in this case",
    "the probability to obtain the measurement result  1 \" during @xmath361 is given by @xmath376 where @xmath50 is the temporal pulse shape of the single photon field .",

    "@xmath368 , these differential equations can be explicitly solved , yielding @xmath382 , @xmath383 , and @xmath384 , where @xmath27 and @xmath385 satisfy @xmath386 and @xmath387 . substituting these solutions @xmath377 for the dark state condition @xmath370",
    ", we have @xmath388 . combining these three equations",
    ", we end up with the relation @xmath389 and thus see that the input pulse shape has to be a rising exponential function @xmath390 .    summarizing",
    ", we have recovered the same result obtained in section  3 , showing that the dark state principle is equivalent to the zero - dynamics principle .",
    "both principles require no energy leaking from the system into the output field , but their approaches are different ; the dark state principle is represented in the schrdinger picture , while the heisenberg picture is used to describe the zero - dynamics principle . as a result ,",
    "in the former case we need to solve the master equation , which is sometimes a hard task as demonstrated above especially in the single photon field case .",
    "on the other hand , we have seen in section 4.2 that the zero - dynamics principle allows us to derive the rising exponential function very easily , even in the general setup ; also the transfer - function - based treatment of the principle is notable and possibly very useful from the viewpoint of the applicability of the linear response theory to quantum memory .",
    "of course these special advantages appear particularly in the linear case , and for more general nonlinear memory systems we should be careful in choosing the approach .",
