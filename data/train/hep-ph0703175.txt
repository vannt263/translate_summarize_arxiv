    "thermal leptogenesis  @xcite is a well - motivated scenario for the production of the baryon asymmetry in the early universe .",
    "it takes place through the decay of heavy right - handed ( rh ) majorana neutrinos .",
    "the out - of - equilibrium decays occur violating lepton number and cp , thus satisfying sakharov s conditions  @xcite . in grand",
    "unified theories ( gut ) the masses of the heavy majorana neutrinos masses are typically smaller than the scale of unification of the electroweak and strong interactions , @xmath0  gev , by a few to several orders of magnitude .",
    "this range coincides with the range of values of the heavy majorana neutrino masses required for a successful thermal leptogenesis .",
    "being rh neutrinos a key ingredient in the formulation of the well - known seesaw mechanism  @xcite , which explains why neutrinos are massive and mix among each other and why they turn out to be much lighter than the other known fermions of the standard model ( sm ) , thermal leptogenesis has been the subject of intense research activity in the last few years . for instance",
    ", flavour effects have been recently investigated in detail ( and shown to be relevant ) @xcite including the quantum oscillations / correlations of the asymmetries in lepton flavour space  @xcite .",
    "the interactions related to the charged yukawa couplings enter in the dynamics by inducing nonvanishing quantum oscillations among the lepton asymmetries in flavour space @xcite .",
    "therefore the lepton asymmetries must be represented as a matrix in flavour space , the diagonal elements are the flavour asymmetries , and the off - diagonals encode the quantum correlations .",
    "the off - diagonals should decay away when the charged yukawa couplings start mediating very fast processes .",
    "for instance , at temperatures",
    "@xmath1 gev , the interactions mediated by the tau - yukawa coupling enter in equilibrium and the tau - flavour becomes distinguishable from the muon and the electron flavour .",
    "a full treatment of this transition based on the quantum , rather than classical , boltzmann equations is suitable to properly describe all the physical effects .",
    "mainly , but not only , motivated by the impact of flavour effects , in this paper we set the stage for the study of the dynamics of thermal leptogenesis by means of quantum boltzmann equations ( for a previous study , see @xcite ) .",
    "they are obtained starting from the non - equilibrium quantum field theory based on the closed time - path ( ctp ) formulation .",
    "we will see that the resulting kinetic equations describing the evolution of the lepton asymmetry and the rh neutrinos are non - markovian and present memory effects .",
    "in other words , differently from the classical approach where every scattering in the plasma is independent from the previous one , the particle abundances at a given time depend upon the history of the system .",
    "the more familiar energy - conserving delta functions are replaced by retarded time integrals of time - dependent kernels and cosine functions whose arguments are the energy involved in the various processes .",
    "therefore , the non - markovian kinetic equations include the contribution of coherent processes throughout the history of the kernels .",
    "we will see that one immediate consequence of the ctp approach to thermal leptogenesis is that the cp asymmetry is a function of time and its value at a given instant depends upon the previous history of the system .",
    "furthermore , in the quantum approach , the relaxation times are expected to be typically longer than the one dictated by the classical approach .",
    "particle number densities are replaced by green s functions which are subject both to exponential decays and to an oscillatory behaviour .",
    "this restricts the range of time integration for the scattering terms and leads to a decrease of the wash - out rates .",
    "this is a well - established fact in nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "if the time range of the kernels are shorter than the relaxation time of the particles abundances , the solutions to the quantum and the classical boltzmann equations differ only by terms of the order of the ratio of the timescale of the kernel to the relaxation timescale of the distribution .",
    "in thermal leptogenesis this is typically the case .",
    "however , there are situations where this does not happen . for instance , in the case of resonant leptogenesis and soft leptogenesis , two rh ( s)neutrinos @xmath2 and @xmath3 are almost degenerate in mass and the cp asymmetry from the decay of the first rh @xmath2 is resonantly enhanced if the mass difference @xmath4 is of the order of the decay rate of the second rh neutrino @xmath5 . the typical timescale to build up coherently the cp asymmetry is of the order of @xmath6 , which can be larger than the timescale @xmath7 for the change of the abundance of the @xmath2 s .",
    "this tells us that the reduction of the quantum boltzmann equations to the classical ones should not be taken for granted .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ ctpform ]",
    "we provide the basics of the ctp formulation of non - equilibrium quantum field theory , we set the notations and state the main results which will be used throughout the paper .",
    "the quantum boltzmann equation describing the time evolution of the lepton number asymmetry is formally derived in section [ qbegeneral ] , in terms of propagators and self - energies of the leptons .",
    "sections [ qberhneutrino ] and [ qbeleptonasym ] are devoted to write down more explicitly the quantum boltzmann equations for the abundance of right - handed neutrinos and the lepton asymmetry , respectively .",
    "the familiar classical equations are then easily recovered as a limit case .",
    "section [ qbeleptonasym ] also contains an analysis of the time - dependent cp asymmetry obtained in this more general setup .",
    "concluding remarks are in section [ concl ] .",
    "we first briefly present some of the basic features of the non - equilibrium quantum field theory based on the ctp formalism , also known as schwinger - keldysh formalism @xcite .",
    "the interested reader is referred to the excellent review by chou _",
    "@xcite for a more exhaustive discussion .",
    "since we need the time evolution of the particle asymmetries with definite initial conditions and not simply the transition amplitude of particle reactions , the ordinary equilibrium quantum field theory at finite temperature is not the appropriate tool .",
    "the most appropriate extension of the field theory to deal with non - equilibrium phenomena amounts to generalizing the time contour of integration to a closed time - path .",
    "more precisely , the time integration contour is deformed to run from @xmath8 to @xmath9 and back to @xmath8 ( see fig .  [ contour ] ) .",
    "the ctp formalism is a powerful green s function formulation for describing non - equilibrium phenomena in field theory .",
    "it allows to describe phase - transition phenomena and to obtain a self - consistent set of quantum boltzmann equations . the formalism yields various quantum averages of operators evaluated in the in - state without specifying the out - state . on the contrary ,",
    "the ordinary quantum field theory yields quantum averages of the operators evaluated with an in - state at one end and an out - state at the other .",
    "for example , because of the time - contour deformation , the partition function in the in - in formalism for a complex scalar field is defined to be @xmath10 & = & { \\rm tr}\\ : \\left [ \\mathcal{t}\\left ( { \\rm exp}\\left[i\\:\\int_c\\:\\left(j(x)\\phi(x)+ j^{\\dagger}(x)\\phi^{\\dagger}(x ) \\right ) d^4 x\\right]\\right)\\rho\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & = & { \\rm tr}\\:\\left [ \\mathcal{t}_{+}\\left ( { \\rm exp}\\left [ i\\:\\int\\ : \\left(j_{+}(x)\\phi_{+}(x)+j^{\\dagger}_{+}(x)\\phi^{\\dagger}_{+}(x ) \\right ) d^4 x\\right]\\right ) \\right . \\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\left .",

    "the symbol @xmath12 represents the initial density matrix and the fields are in the heisenberg picture and defined on this closed time - contour ( plus and minus subscripts refer to the positive and negative directional branches of the time path , respectively ) .",
    "the time - ordering operator along the path is the standard one ( @xmath13 ) on the positive branch , and the anti - time - ordering ( @xmath14 ) on the negative branch . as with the euclidean - time formulation , scalar ( fermionic ) fields @xmath15 are still periodic ( anti - periodic ) in time , but with @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the temperature @xmath18 appears due to boundary condition , and time is now explicitly present in the integration contour .",
    "we must now identify field variables with arguments on the positive or negative directional branches of the time path .",
    "this doubling of field variables leads to six different real - time propagators on the contour @xcite .",
    "these six propagators are not independent , but using all of them simplifies the notation . for a generic charged scalar field @xmath15",
    "they are defined as @xmath19 where the last two green s functions are the retarded and advanced green s functions respectively and @xmath20 is the step function .    for a generic fermion field @xmath21 the six different propagators are analogously defined as @xmath22 from the definitions of the green s functions , one can see that the hermiticity properties    @xmath23    are satisfied . when computing a loop diagram , one has to assign to the interaction points a plus or a minus sign in all possible manners and sum all the possible diagrams , taking into account that , by definition , vertices with a minus sign must be multiplied by @xmath24 .    for equilibrium phenomena , the brackets @xmath25 imply a thermodynamic average over all the possible states of the system . for homogeneous systems in equilibrium ,",
    "the green s functions depend only upon the difference of their arguments @xmath26 and there is no dependence upon @xmath27 ; for systems out of equilibrium , the definitions ( [ def1 ] ) and ( [ def2 ] ) have a different meaning .",
    "the concept of thermodynamic averaging is now ill - defined . instead , the brackets mean the need to average over all the available states of the system for the non - equilibrium distributions .",
    "furthermore , the arguments of the green s functions @xmath28 are not usually given as the difference @xmath29 .",
    "for example , non - equilibrium could be caused by transients which make the green s functions depend upon @xmath30 rather than @xmath31 .    for interacting systems , whether in equilibrium or not , one must define and calculate self - energy functions .",
    "again , there are six of them : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the same relationships exist among them as for the green s functions in ( [ def1 ] ) and ( [ def2 ] ) , such as @xmath38 the self - energies are incorporated into the green s functions through the use of dyson s equations .",
    "a useful notation may be introduced which expresses four of the six green s functions as the elements of two - by - two matrices @xcite    @xmath39    where the upper signs refer to the bosonic case and the lower signs to the fermionic case . for systems either in equilibrium or in non - equilibrium ,",
    "dyson s equation is most easily expressed by using the matrix notation @xmath40 where the superscript `` 0 '' on the green s functions means to use those for noninteracting system .",
    "it is useful to notice that dyson s equation can be written in an alternative form , instead of ( [ d1 ] ) , with @xmath41 on the right in the interaction terms , @xmath42 eqs .",
    "( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ d2 ] ) are the starting points to derive the quantum boltzmann equations describing the time evolution of the cp - violating particle density asymmetries .",

    "the cp asymmetry grows starting from a vanishing value and , for @xmath134 , it averages to the constant value quoted in the literature @xcite . this is true if the timescale for the other processes relevant for leptogenesis is larger than @xmath133 .",
    "in other words , one may define an `` average '' cp asymmetry    @xmath135    where @xmath136 represents the typical timescale of the other processes relevant for leptogenesis , _",
    "e.g. _ the @xmath120 scatterings .",
    "if @xmath137 , the oscillating functions in ( [ kkk ] ) are averaged to zero and the average cp asymmetry is given by the value used in the literature .",
    "however , the expression ( [ ll ] ) should be used when @xmath138 .",
    "the fact that the cp asymmetry is a function of time is particularly relevant in the case in which the asymmetry is generated by the decays of two heavy states which are nearly degenerate in mass and oscillate into one another with a timescale given by the inverse of the mass difference .",
    "this is the case of resonant leptogenesis @xcite and soft leptogenesis @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ ll ] ) it is manifest that the cp asymmetry itself oscillates with the very same timescale and such a dependence may or may not be neglected depending upon the rates of the other processes in the plasma . if @xmath139 , the time dependence of the cp asymmetry may not be neglected .            the expression ( [ ll ] ) can also be used , once it is divided by a factor 2 ( because in the wave diagram also the charged states of higgs and lepton doublets may propagate ) and the limit @xmath140 is taken , for the cp asymmetry contribution from the vertex diagram ( see fig .",

    "therefore , one can safely average over many oscillations , getting the expression present in the literature    @xmath143    finally , the @xmath120 inverse decays can be computed along the same lines described previously by considering the one - loop contribution to the lepton doublet self - energy @xmath95 ( see fig .",
    "[ lep1loop ] ) .",
    "the equation for the lepton asymmetry then becomes    @xmath144    where @xmath145 is the total time - dependent cp asymmetry for the flavour @xmath146 , and @xmath147,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the time - dependent thermal average of the inverse - decay interaction rate .",
    "the quantum boltzmann equations derived in this paper can be used to perform a thorough investigation of the impact of flavour effects onto leptogenesis and , on more general grounds , to provide a quantitative relation between the light neutrino properties and the final baryon asymmetry .",
    "it would be interesting to see how large are the corrections to the baryon asymmetry once the non - markovian description is adopted , including memory effects and off - shell corrections .",
    "they may lead to the slowdown of the relaxation processes thus keeping the system out of equilibrium for longer times and therefore to an enhancement of the final baryon asymmetry .",
    "it would also be of interest to see the impact of our results on the transition between one flavour and two flavours as we discussed in the introduction .",
    "one of the main results of our investigation is that the cp asymmetry turns out to be a function of time and its value at a given instant of time depends on the past history of the system , see for instance eq .",

    "this result is relevant when the timescale of the evolution of the cp asymmetry is larger than the timescale of the other processes .",
