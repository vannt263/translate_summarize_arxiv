    "mergers are the most extreme type of galaxy interaction , as the final product of a merger event can be totally different from the original objects involved .",
    "considerable efforts have been devoted towards the understanding of the physical processes that regulate galaxy mergers starting from the very early work of @xcite or the seminal simulational works presented in @xcite .",
    "these work made it clear that , even though the stars rarely collide with each other during a merger process , such episodes can have dramatic consequences for the gaseous component of the galaxies involved .",
    "later works such as those of have helped address specific issues of merger processes such as the internal structure of the remnants , the relevance of the orbital parameters or the impact of the gas fraction on the possible regeneration of galactic discs after a merger episode .",
    "however , the study of mergers is not only relevant because of the physics involved . the evolution of the massive early type galaxies that populate the red sequence can not be explained using passive evolution models only , and mergers have been found to play a key role in their evolution . in particular ,",
    "the evolution of the luminosity function and colours of galaxies since @xmath4 observed in the combo-17 ( classifying objects by medium - band observations in 17 filters ) and the phase 2 of the deep ( deep extragalactic evolutionary probe ) survey @xcite suggest that the merger episodes have a huge impact on the evolution of early - type galaxies , increasing the stellar mass by a factor of two over the last 8gyr .",
    "more recently , the importance of mergers has been highlighted in @xcite , who conclude that the evolution of massive , red galaxies depends strongly on their merging history .",
    "further studies have helped ascertain the impact of mergers in specific aspects of the evolution of red galaxies , including masses @xcite , sizes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) and velocity dispersions @xcite .",
    "the identification of mergers in deep astronomical images is thus a very important issue for galaxy evolution studies , and the huge number of galaxies observed in modern surveys creates the need of reliable automated merger detection mechanisms .",
    "a reliable merger identification technique is the key element in the calculation of the merger fraction .",
    "the merger fraction is defined as the fraction of galaxies with a recognizable ongoing merger episode that is found in any given ( often mass - limited ) sample .",
    "it is the first step towards the _ comoving _ merger rate , which is the number of merger _",
    "events _ per @xmath5 .",
    "several automatic identification techniques have been developed to single out mergers from non interacting galaxies .",
    "these methods use morphological criteria ( cas and @xmath6 systems , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , kinematical and spatial close pairs @xcite , or even the correlation function @xcite .",
    "the morphological techniques are based on the fact that the objects involved in a merger episode will be gravitationally disturbed .",
    "the cas ( concentration , asymmetry , clumpiness ) system measures these specific aspects of the surface brightness distribution of galaxies in order to identify mergers .",
    "objects with high asymmetries are usually taken to be mergers by this method . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath6 system measures whether the galaxies appear to be shredded or not , since both the gini and the @xmath7 numbers measure whether and how is the light concentrated in any given object . in this system ,",
    "the more shredded galaxies are selected as mergers .",
    "the pairing techniques look for pairs of galaxies whose relative positions and velocities should be conducive to strong interactions in a relatively short timescale after observation .",
    "each of these methodologies are sensitive to different time scales , mass ratios , orbital parameters , and gaseous content of the galaxies involved .",
    "for instance , @xcite conclude that the cas parameters are sensitive to roughly a timescale of @xmath8 years , while the time sensitivity of the pairing techniques depend on the projected separation between the galaxies .",
    "this work contributes to the morphological automated detection of mergers .",
    "here , the morphological parameters _ of the residual images _ after the subtraction of a smooth srsic model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a definition of this profile ) are explored .",
    "this should , at least in principle , better reveal the impact of the gravitational interaction on the morphology of galaxies .",
    "this was done with the aspiration of detecting minor mergers .",
    "an isolated galaxy will , with time , adopt an approximately symmetric profile whereas an interacting galaxy will appear to be more asymmetric .",
    "the removal of an intrinsically symmetric profile such as the srsic model , which could be regarded as the quiescent , underlying galaxy , will more clearly expose the asymmetric signature of the light from an interacting galaxy .",
    "thus , the structure of the residuals is investigated with the aim of finding the combination of structural parameters that produces merger samples of better statistical quality .",
    "this optimization step is done in an unambiguous way , by using an objective criterion to grade the performance of the diagnostics tried .",
    "the specific criterion used here encourages completeness at the expense of a fairly high contamination by non - mergers , and the resulting merger sample needs to be cleaned afterwards .    in this paper ,  [ sec : obsdata ] presents the observational data used together with the galaxy samples selected to derive and then test the proposed method . section  [ sec : numeros ] describes the data processing techniques employed , and the structural parameters used . section  [ sec : ident ] presents the objective method introduced here to determine what combination of structural parameters produces the merger sample of highest statistical quality .",
    "the precise definition of the `` statistical quality '' of a sample that is selected from a parent population is given in ",
    "[ subsec : fscore ] .",
    "[ sec : further ] presents a visual analysis of the objects selected as potential mergers by the method presented here , focusing on the contamination of the resulting sets of merger galaxies by non - mergers (  [ subsec : contaminacion ] ) and on the ability to detect minor mergers (  [ subsec : minors ] ) . finally , ",
    "[ sec : conclusiones ] presents the conclusions of this work .",
    "the data used to illustrate this method is provided by the hst / acs f606w observations that were obtained as a part of the space telescope a901/902 galaxy evolution survey ( stages ) @xcite .",
    "stages is a multiwavelength project that was designed to explore the impact of environment on galaxy evolution .",
    "its main target is a multiple cluster of galaxies located at @xmath9 that harbors different environments with different densities . at the distance of this multiple cluster , 1 arcsecond corresponds to 2.83 kpc .",
    "this survey also includes x - ray xmm - newton , uv galex , ir spitzer , spectroscopic 2df , radio giant metrewave telescope , and optical combo-17 observations .",
    "the hst / acs stages observations form an 80-tile mosaic that covers almost @xmath10 in the f606w filter , with an average exposure time of around 2 ks .",
    "the observations were reduced using an output pixel scale of 0.03 arcsec , and a _ pixfrac _ of 0.8 , in order to keep the psf ellipticity as stable as possible for weak lensing studies .",
    "the psf full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) is 3.12 pixels .",
    "the point source completeness limit of these images is @xmath11 .",
    "these observations are deep enough so as to probe most of the luminosity function of galaxies in clusters , as it is possible to recover reliable structural information for galaxies up to an absolute magnitude of @xmath12 .",
    "this limit is just two magnitudes brighter than the most luminous globular clusters , and is typical of dwarf elliptical systems .",
    "this work makes use of a mass and magnitude selected sample ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) which is very similar to the sample used in @xcite .",
    "the galaxies are all in the @xmath15 redshift range , with a relative dearth of sources in the lower end of this interval .",
    "the mass limit ensures that the sample is complete in stellar mass for both the blue cloud and the red sequence , as was shown in .",
    "the magnitude limit guarantees reliable visual morphologies , since all the sources show extended images in the hst / acs data .",
    "the sample includes 1560 galaxies distributed among both the field and the cluster environments .",
    "the sample can also be divided into four different morphological classifications labeled as `` e '' , `` s0 '' , `` sp '' , and `` oth '' . the `` e '' bin is made of course of elliptical systems , the `` s0 '' bin gathers the lenticular galaxies , the `` sp '' bin comprises the spiral galaxies , and the `` oth '' bin includes a mixture of irregulars , compact , and highly disturbed sources that do not fit into any of the other galaxy classes .",
    "the `` oth '' bin includes 235 irregular galaxies , 41 disturbed galaxies , and 13 compact sources .",
    "this bin is thus dominated by irregular systems .",
    "this sample was selected for the current work due to the following reasons .    1 .",
    "most of the galaxies are found in the fairly narrow @xmath16 range , and only @xmath17 of the objects are in the @xmath18 interval .",
    "the lookback time is thus approximately the same for most objects and no age related systematic effects are expected .",
    "the stages hst / acs observations will also probe similar rest frame wavelength intervals redwards of the 4000  break , observing the same stellar populations .",
    "the spatial resolution is approximately the same for most sources , too .",
    "there is no need to apply _ morphological _ @xmath19 or distance corrections to the structural parameters .",
    "it is important to keep in mind , though , that the total @xmath20 spread could be relatively large , ranging from 0.0 mags for the nearest blue objects to 1.0 mags for the farthest red galaxies .",
    "the @xmath21 cosmological dimming could also introduce a bias of around 0.5 mag between the high redshift objects and those located at the cluster s distance .",
    "however , the sample used in this work is a mass limited sample , and the faint magnitude cut applied is only made in order to ensure that all the relevant structural parameters can be measured reliably .",
    "this makes it possible to estimate the fraction of sources that could be affected by the @xmath20 and cosmological dimming biases previously mentioned .",
    "this is done by adding 1.5 mag to the observed magnitudes and calculating the fraction of sources that would have been excluded from the sample in this situation .",
    "this simple estimate indicates that 90% of the galaxies in the current sample should be free from these systematics .",
    "this sample includes a good number of galaxies of several morphological types residing in very different environments .",
    "this makes it ideally suited to explore whether the performance of our merger indicators is sensitive to these variables or not .",
    "all the objects of this sample also have good morphological information , which will be presented in detail in a forthcoming paper ( gray _ et al_. in prep . ) .",
    "the morphological catalogue was created using visual classification from seven stages team members who were first trained on a consistent subsample of previously classified galaxies .",
    "all 5090 galaxies with @xmath22 and @xmath23 were classified blind without knowledge of their cluster or field membership .",
    "galaxies were randomly assigned to classifiers who used a revised hubble t - type scale and weighting scheme described in @xcite .",
    "each galaxy in the sample was classified by three people , while a subset of 786 bright galaxies previously studied in received classifications from all seven .",
    "in addition to the revised hubble t - type , classifiers were also able to note further information about the galaxy structure within certain well - defined parameters .",
    "the dynamical state involved an interpretation of the probable cause of any observed disruption , where the possibilities were a tidal interaction with a neighbour ( i ) ; tidal interaction suggesting a merger ( m ) ; tidal feature without obvious cause ( t ) ; and chaotic systems ( c ) .",
    "the degree of disruption was quantified by a disturbance parameter which was allowed values of 0 , indicating little or no disturbance ; [ 1,2 ] indicating moderate / strong asymmetry ( e.g. an hii region ) ; [ 3,4 ] showing a moderate or strong distortion ( e.g. a tidal tail ) .",
    "the precise sample definition and its breakdown are now summarized .    1 .",
    "this sample is defined by a redshift interval @xmath24 $ ] , where the photometric redshifts have been calculated from the combo-17 data , and the half - width + @xmath25 + is allowed to vary with apparent @xmath26 band magnitude .",
    "this redshift interval varies with apparent brightness due to the higher precision of the combo-17 photometric redshifts for the brighter sources , ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a more detailed explanation . ) .",
    "the photo-@xmath27 half - width distribution was normalized so the completeness was @xmath28 at any magnitude . for the faint end , there is also some sample contamination from field galaxies .",
    "this was calculated using the counts of the smooth models seen in fig .",
    "14 of @xcite .",
    "when estimating the contamination , the field distribution was assumed to be consistent with the average galaxy counts @xmath29 outside the cluster .",
    "the average contamination is 30% .",
    "this subsample thus contains cluster galaxies with good photometry for which the hst / acs observations show an extended source .",
    "this cluster sample contains 905 galaxies .",
    "this includes galaxies in the redshift intervals @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath31 $ ] . in this subsample , only hst / acs extended sources with good photometry are included .",
    "this field sample contains 655 galaxies .",
    "this leaves a final sample of 655 field galaxies ( 100 e , 60 s0 , 318 sp , 177 oth ) and 905 cluster galaxies ( 192 e , 216 s0 , 383 sp , 114 oth ) . as before ,",
    "the `` oth '' galaxies represent a mixture of irregulars , compact , and highly disturbed systems .",
    "this classification is dominated by irregular galaxies . the stages morphological catalogue has good morphological information for all objects in this sample .",
    "the source detection runs presented in ",
    "[ subsec : sextractor ] and the structural parameter analysis presented in ",
    "[ subsec : galfit ] yielded structural information for a total of 1537 sources .",
    "thus , there is structural information available for 98.5% of the full sample .",
    "this section presents the sextractor runs and subsequent morphological analysis carried out here .",
    "the main ingredients this work needs are an error or weight image and a mask image .",
    "the error image is needed by both sextractor and galfit @xcite in order to modulate the importance of each pixel in the photometry and morphological properties .",
    "the mask image , which is created by sextractor , is later needed by galfit so that it fits galaxies in a way that is designed to identify mergers .",
    "the basic idea is to produce a simple srsic model that is as focused on the main body of the target galaxies as possible .",
    "the putative mergers should not therefore have any effect on these fits and will be either simultaneously fit or masked out .",
    "this srsic model should be an appropriate description of the surface brightness distribution of elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , it has to be noted that in the case of lenticular and spiral galaxies , bulge+disc decompositions ( b+d ) would produce better descriptions .",
    "however , there are a number of reasons that make simple srsic fits preferable .",
    "* a simple sersic profile will remove a fraction of the smooth , symmetric signal from any given galaxy , regardless of its morphology .",
    "this statement remains true for disc galaxies . *",
    "the goal of the current work is to develop an automatic and fork free method .",
    "the use of b+d decompositions together with simple srsic fits would require an additional step in order to decide what functional form describes best each galaxy .",
    "there are objective ways to do this , such as the bayesian method presented in @xcite or the akaike information criterion , but this is well beyond the scope of the current work .",
    "* b+d decompositions need to be re - examined for their internal consistency , as their final results might depend on the initial point in parameter space chosen for the galfit minimization .",
    "thus , it is not possible to use the sextractor and structural catalogue presented in @xcite because the source detection and fits shown there were made with the goal of creating a robust catalogue of structural parameters derived from single srsic fits . instead , the sextractor configuration used in the current work ( see  [ subsec : sextractor ] ) is fairly sensitive to the detection of faint , small features , as it is set to detect the faintest sources that can be said to be detectable in the images used . more importantly ,",
    "the deblending parameters are selected so that sextractor will tell apart sources with up to a three magnitude brightness difference , incorporating much of the ` 1:3 ` to ` 1:10 ` mass ratio range defining minor mergers , assuming that their @xmath32 ratios are similar .",
    "these sextractor parameters are thus not only intended to separate the objects involved in a major merger , with luminosity ratios between ` 1:1 ` and ` 1:3 ` , but are also geared towards the deblending of the objects involved in a minor merger episode , with luminosity ratios between ` 1:3 ` and ` 1:10 ` .",
    "also , the very sensitive detection threshold employed makes it more likely that the less luminous segment of any given deblended object will be engulfed by the kron aperture of the larger segment .",
    "this is key in the current analysis , since it is hypothesized here that such less luminous segments could be the less luminous galaxies in merger episodes .",
    "however , these smaller segments could just be hii regions or simply objects along the same line of sight , which will naturally lead to a contamination of the merger sample .",
    "this will be discussed in  [ subsec : contaminacion ] .",
    "the larger segments in deblended sources would then be the more luminous galaxies .",
    "the kron aperture @xcite is defined to contain a specific fraction of the light of a galaxy .",
    "such fraction depends on the intrinsic profile of galaxies , but it ranges from 90% for the steepest profiles to 95% for exponential disks .",
    "both percentages depend on the observed surface brightness , though , in the sense that sextractor misses more flux from the dimmest objects .",
    "see @xcite for a description of this systematic error .",
    "the larger and more luminous object is then fit by a smooth srsic model which is created using galfit according to the rules explained in ",
    "[ subsec : galfit ] .",
    "this model is then subtracted from the original image in order to estimate how the image would look without the more luminous galaxy of a merger event . this _",
    "residual _ image still contains most of the signal from the less luminous sources that were found within the observed kron aperture of the larger object .",
    "this ensures that these smaller sources will have a great impact on the structural properties of the _ residual _ images .",
    "this is indeed one interesting property of these _ residual _ images that will be exploited .",
    "the structural parameters of both the original image and of the residual image are then calculated within the aforementioned kron aperture .",
    "the specific morphological parameters used are shown in ",
    "[ subsec : extendedcas ] .",
    "these are mostly based in previous works .",
    "the structural parameters of the residual image within the kron aperture are then expected to be very sensitive to the smaller and less luminous member of the merger .",
    "sextractor was run twice on each of the 80 tiles that compose the stages hst / acs f606w mosaic .",
    "the first pass was performed for the sole purpose of obtaining an empirical map of the background variance and of the filtered poissonian signal .",
    "such images can be produced by sextractor as _ output _ images .",
    "these images were then combined to produce an appropriate weight image to be used in the second pass . the first sextractor run is presented in  [ subsubsec : sextractor1 ] , and it can be safely skipped by users providing their own error or weight images . the second run is presented in  [ subsubsec : sextractor2 ] , which presents the sextractor configurations used to produce the final source lists and mask images .",
    "the most relevant sextractor parameters used in the first run are summarized in table  [ tab : sextractor1 ] .",
    "table  [ tab : sextractor1 ] also presents the main results obtained from this first sextractor run , averaged over the 80 tiles .",
    "the average background sigma is an estimate of the noise that is observed in the image areas in which there are no galaxies .",
    "this is set by the readout noise of the analog - to - digital converters of the acs camera , the poissonian noise of the sky background and the use of the multidrizzle technique .",
    "it was estimated as the average of the median values of the background _ rms _ images created by sextractor in this first pass . the average effective gain @xmath33 roughly measures the growth in the photometric errors caused by the intrinsic poissonian nature of photon counting measurements .",
    "it was measured using the background subtracted filtered frame and a very rough empirical estimate of the per - pixel _ rms _ image obtained by means of a loose adaptation of the method presented in , which shows precise formulae to calculate the _ rms _ of an image in the case of noise correlation .",
    "the effective gain image is then .    @xmath34    where i is the background subtracted filtered image , and",
    "_ rms _ is the empirically derived uncertainty .",
    "the @xmath35 number is yielded by the value of this image in the brighter areas of the images dominated by the poissonian noise .",
    "the measured value of @xmath33 , reported in table  [ tab : sextractor1 ] agrees very well with its expected value of around 1445 , which can be theoretically estimated as :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the effective gain , @xmath38 is the original detector s gain ( 2 , for the stages observations ) , t is the total exposure time , and the fraction is the ratio between the effective areas of the pixels before and after the operation of the multidrizzle technique . the latter value of 1445.0 was adopted for use in the second run of sextractor .",
    "the measured value of @xmath37 was then merely used as a sanity check to ensure that the errors in the input image indeed behave as expected .",
    "the first sextractor run thus produces an estimate of the background @xmath39 and a background subtracted filtered frame containing the poissonian signal @xmath40 .",
    "these were combined according to the usual ccd error equation in order to obtain a weight image for use in the second sextractor run :    @xmath41    where weight is the final weight image , @xmath42 is the background _",
    "rms _ image , @xmath40 is the background subtracted filtered image created by sextractor , and @xmath43 .",
    "the final weight image was later processed using the weightwatchers code to ensure that problematic pixels with either zero exposure time ( typical of the image edges ) or with saturated signal were assigned zero weight .",
    "less than 2% of the pixels had to be discarded in this final procedure .",
    "weightwatchers also produces a flag image that was used in the second pass of sextractor .",
    "this final weight frame is then used in the second run of sextractor to supress the detection of objects in low weight pixels and give appropriate pixel weights for the photometry .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     figure  [ fig : minormergercandidates1 ] shows that the @xmath44 method presented here has detected galaxies that do present inhomogeneities in their light distribution",
    ". these inhomogeneities typically amount to 10% of the total flux received from the parent galaxy , as estimated by the crude but robust flux estimate given by sextractor .",
    "this confirms the potential validity of the approach presented in the current paper to separate minor mergers from the whole parent population of galaxies .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : minormergercandidates1 ] also makes manifest the reason of the fairly high contamination by non - mergers that has been found in  [ subsec : contaminacion ] .",
    "it is very difficult , even with the eye , to tell apart galaxies undergoing a minor merger episode from galaxies that are experiencing other local phenomena such as star formation in hii regions .",
    "this is particularly true in the case of very late minor mergers , in which the less massive galaxies have been almost entirely dissolved amidst the larger galaxies .",
    "however , for less evolved merger systems for which the less luminous object has not entirely lost its individuality , it is easier to separate mergers and non - mergers .",
    "specifically , objects 20213 and 7479 represent two cases of objects selected by the @xmath44 that could indeed be star formation enhancements .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : minormergercandidates1 ] also shows that , although the structural merger diagnostic used here can indeed select galaxies with inhomogeneous light distributions , this method alone can not identify which light clump is to be identified as the potential satellite .",
    "this is best seen in the case of id=40654 .",
    "we present a new structural merger diagnostic geared towards the structural detection of minor mergers which is entirely based in the morphological properties of the _ residual _ images of galaxies after the subtraction of a smooth srsic model .",
    "the new indicator makes use of the asymmetry of the residuals and of the residual flux fraction of the fit , both calculated over the kron aperture of the galaxies .",
    "this diagnostic has been objectively proven to be able of producing merger samples of equal or better statistical quality than samples obtained using other well established methods based on the morphological properties of the original images . in particular , objects with symmetric residuals for which the residual flux fraction is larger than 0.2 or objects with more asymmetric residuals for which the rff is larger than 0.1 are very good candidates to be mergers .",
    "we have also found that the gini index of the residuals could also produce merger samples of high statistical purity . in this case , objects for which the gini index of the residual image calculated within the kron aperture is higher than 0.5 are also good merger candidates .    using the structural parameters of the residuals and the limits provided by the @xmath45 optimization process shown here",
    ", we have split the whole population of galaxies into two different set of galaxies .",
    "the first set , sharing the structural trends and properties of the mergers included in the training set is shown to contain the majority of _ major and minor _ mergers .",
    "the second set has been shown to be almost completely free of mergers , as exposed by the very low _ negative _ contamination rates .",
    "however , given the relative dearth of mergers among the general galaxy population and the self - imposed goal of detecting the more elusive _ minor _ mergers , it turns out that the @xmath44 diagnostic introduced in this paper works best as a negative merger test . in other words , it is very effective at selecting non - merging galaxies . in common with all the currently - available automatic methods ,",
    "the sample of both _ major and minor _ merger candidates selected by our test is heavily contaminated by non - mergers , and further steps are needed to produce a clean merger sample from the first set of galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , the methodology introduced in this paper can be very useful when applied to the huge datasets provided by modern large area surveys such as sdss or ukidss . by visually classifying a relatively small and manageable number of galaxies",
    ", one can derive the resulting cuts and `` best '' borders which can then be applied to the whole sample .",
    "this would produce two statistically well - defined sets of galaxies , a smaller one containing the vast majority of _ both major and minor _ mergers , and a much larger one almost completely devoid of them . to identify bona - fide mergers",
    ", only the first set would need to be processed further to remove the non mergers .",
    "this could be done either by visual inspection or by using additional information such as colours or 3-d spectra .",
    "this work also suggests that the use of the structural parameters of the residual images could indeed be used as a tool to study the properties of minor mergers .",
    "we argue that this is due to the fact that by removing the bulk of the host galaxy light we might able to detect much fainter merging galaxies and over much longer timescales .",
    "this will be further studied by using n - body merger simulations in a forthcoming paper , which will eventually provide the way to link the structural parameters measured over the hst / acs images with the underlying properties of the observed mergers .",
