    "the study of pulsars and their spin - down provides important information on the physics of neutron stars . this information ( e.g. magnetic field , moment of inertia ,",
    "etc . ) can be gleaned from the pulsar spin - down by assuming a physical model for the spin - down torque . for isolated pulsars",
    ", it is usually assumed that the spin - down torque is due to magnetic dipole radiation ( mdr ) , which produces a timing age @xmath3 and pulsar braking index @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the pulsar spin period and period derivative , respectively ( this calculation of @xmath7 assumes that the initial spin period was much smaller than the observed spin period ) . assuming mdr spin - down , the surface magnetic field strength of the neutron star is given by the formula @xmath8 g , which has been widely used to estimate the magnetic field strengths of isolated pulsars ( e.g. manchester & taylor 1977 ) .",
    "perhaps the only way to test the mdr spin - down hypothesis for pulsars is to study the snrs associated with young pulsars , because the snrs provide an age constraint independent of the pulsar spin - down .",
    "there are at least two pulsars with snr ages which are inconsistent with the timing ages of the pulsars calculated assuming mdr spin - down : psr b1757@xmath024 and psr j1846@xmath00258 .",
    "psr b1757@xmath024 is a 0.125 s radio pulsar associated with snr g5.4@xmath01.2 .",
    "given the displacement of the pulsar from the center of g5.4@xmath01.2 , the lack of observed proper motion of the pulsar with respect to its snr implies an age @xmath9 39 kyr ( gaensler & frail 2000 ) , which is more than a factor of two greater than the mdr timing age of 16 kyr . because the pulsar / snr association seems so compelling , gaensler & frail ( 2000 ) suggested that this age discrepancy raises very serious problems for all pulsar ages based on mdr .",
    "recently , the 0.324 s x - ray pulsar psr j1846@xmath00258 was discovered ( gotthelf et al . 2000 ) in the center of the snr kes 75 .",
    "the mdr timing age of the pulsar is @xmath7= 0.7 kyr , which is much less than the estimated minimum age of kes 75 .",
    "a lower limit to the age of the snr can be estimated by assuming that the remnant is still undergoing free expansion . in this case , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the radius of kes 75 ( 9.7 pc ; blanton & helfand 1996 ) , @xmath12 is the density of the interstellar medium surrounding kes 75 , and @xmath13 is the total mass of ejecta with free expansion velocities greater than @xmath14 .",
    "realistic models of the velocity profiles of type ii supernova ejecta in free expansion consist of a broken power law distribution of ejecta velocities , such that the majority of the mass and energy is in the low - velocity ejecta . as a function of the ejecta power law index @xmath15 ( index @xmath16 in truelove & mckee 1999 ) , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the total ejecta mass",
    ", @xmath19 is the maximum ejecta velocity , and @xmath20 is the transition velocity below which the distribution of ejecta velocities ( in velocity space ) is flat .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 can be eliminated by normalizing equation ( 2 ) to a total ejecta kinetic energy @xmath21 , and equations ( @xmath22 ) can then be solved for the cutoff velocity @xmath14 for a given @xmath12 , @xmath11 , @xmath15 , @xmath18 , and @xmath21 ( the result is insensitive to the value of @xmath19 ) . the minimum age in free expansion is then given simply by @xmath23 .",
    "for @xmath24 ( chevalier & fransson 1994 ) , @xmath25 ergs , @xmath11= 9.7 pc , @xmath18= 20 @xmath26 , @xmath19= 20,000 km s@xmath27 , and assuming the snr is in the hot , most tenuous phase of the ism with @xmath28= 0.001 , we estimate a minimum age @xmath29 2.0 kyr for kes 75 .",
    "this is a factor of three greater than the pulsar s mdr timing age of 0.7 kyr .",
    "what conditions must be met for kes 75 to have the same age as the mdr timing age of psr j1846@xmath00258 ?",
    "the minimum age estimate above is insensitive to @xmath19 , but decreases as @xmath21 increases or @xmath18 decreases . for @xmath24 and @xmath30 @xmath31 , and assuming a minimum type ii supernova ejecta mass of @xmath16.6 m@xmath32 ( for an 8 m@xmath32 progenitor star forming a 1.4 m@xmath32 neutron star ) , we find that @xmath33 for kes 75 only if e@xmath34 ergs , which is roughly three times greater than the energy implied by model type ii supernova lightcurves ( shigeyama & nomoto 1990 ) . even for extremely high @xmath21 , @xmath33 seems unlikely because the ism density surrounding kes 75 is probably much greater than 0.001 @xmath31 .",
    "this is because an oh maser emission line has been observed from the snr ( green et al .",
    "1997 ) , which is thought to result from the supernova shock interacting with a dense molecular cloud .",
    "therefore , @xmath35 2 kyr is probably a very conservative lower limit to the kes 75 age , since increasing @xmath36 increases the minimum age from the arguments above .",
    "the age discrepancy problems outlined above suggest that simple mdr spin - down is incorrect for these pulsars , and that exploration ( e.g. marsen , lingenfelter , & rothschild 2001 ) of more complete spin - down models is warranted .",
    "we consider a hybrid spin - down model consisting of mdr torques plus the addition of spin - down torque due to the `` propeller effect '' ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) from material at the pulsar magnetosphere . in the case of psrs b1757@xmath024 and j1846@xmath00258 , this material could be supernova ejecta captured by the neutron star in the form of a _ fallback disk_. fallback disks may be roughly divided into two categories : `` prompt '' and `` delayed ''",
    ". prompt disks may be formed from @xmath37 ( michel 1991 ; lin , woosley , & bodenheimer 1991 ) of ejecta material soon after the initial core collapse in a type ii supernova explosion ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) . formation of such prompt disks is probably limited to @xmath38 days after the core collapse because of heating of the ejecta by @xmath39ni decays ( chevalier 1989 ) .",
    "delayed disks may form years after the explosion from ejecta decelerated by a strong reverse shock ( truelove & mckee 1999 ) caused by the primary supernova blast wave impinging on dense circumstellar material from the pre - supernova stellar wind .",
    "such models were recently invoked to explain the spin - down of axps ( chatterjee , hernquist & narayan 2000 ) , and sgrs and axps ( marsden et al . 2001 ) .",
    "an artist s conception of the pulsar and accretion disk system is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the total spin - down rate of the neutron star due to the combined disk and mdr torque is given by @xmath40 the mdr torque @xmath41 ( e.g. manchester & taylor 1977 ) , where @xmath42 is the neutron star moment of inertia , @xmath43 is the neutron star radius , and the propeller torque @xmath44 ) ( menou et al .",
    "1999 ) , where @xmath45 is a constant of order unity , @xmath46 g s@xmath27 is the mass infall rate at the magnetosphere , and @xmath47 is the magnetospheric radius . here and elsewhere",
    "we assume @xmath48 km , @xmath49 g @xmath50 , and @xmath51 g is the surface magnetic field strength ( assumed dipole ) .",
    "the equilibrium angular frequency @xmath52 is defined by the condition @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the keplerian co - rotation radius for a neutron star of mass @xmath55 . the timing age @xmath56 under the action of the combined torque model",
    "is then given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the initial angular frequency .",
    "the timing ages were calculated for psr b1757@xmath024 ( @xmath59= 0.125 s ) and psr j1846@xmath00258 ( @xmath59 = 0.324 s ) for a grid of @xmath60 and @xmath61 values using equations ( @xmath62 ) and assuming @xmath63 cm ( chatterjee , hernquist & narayan 2000 ) .",
    "the resulting range of pulsar magnetic fields and magnetospheric accretion rates are shown in figure 2 . for psr b1757@xmath024 ( top panel ) , we find that values of @xmath64 g , @xmath65 g s@xmath27 , and @xmath66 kyr are consistent with the lower limit on the true age of 39 kyr ( gaensler & frail 2000 ) and the present day spin - down rate of the pulsar ( heavy solid line )",
    ". similarly , for psr j1846@xmath00258 ( right panel ) the lower limit on the age ( @xmath67 2 kyr ) gives a range of values @xmath68 g and @xmath69 g s@xmath27 .",
    "in addition , a more stringent constraint is provided by the x - ray luminosity of the pulsar , since ( as seen from the figure ) the magnetic field of the pulsar must be less than @xmath70 g for consistency with the 2 kyr age lower limit .",
    "the mdr luminosity for this magnetic field strength is only @xmath71 ergs s@xmath27  much less than the observed x - ray luminosity of the pulsar ( @xmath72 ergs s@xmath27 ; gotthelf et al .",
    "therefore the x - ray luminosity may be predominantly powered by the magnetospheric accretion in the context of this model , which constrains @xmath61 for a given x - ray efficiency defined by @xmath73 . for @xmath74 1 ,",
    "figure 2 ( bottom ) indicates that a solution exists for @xmath75 g , @xmath76 g s@xmath27 , and @xmath77 kyr . since most of the accretion to the neutron star surface would be inhibited by the centrifugal barrier in these sources , the value of the x - ray efficiency is probably much less than the usually assumed value of @xmath78 appropriate for x - ray binaries .",
    "the discrepancies between the mdr timing ages and supernova remnant ages for pulsars b1757 - 24 and j1846 - 0258 can be resolved by using a more complete spin - down model consisting of both mdr and propeller torques .",
    "one prediction of this model is the presence of excessive pulsar timing noise which is characteristic of noisy propeller torques .",
    "in addition , optical or infrared emission from isolated neutron star accretion disks may be detectable ( perna , hernquist & narayan 2000 ) .",
    "since polar cap accretion is suppressed by the centrifugal barrier for @xmath79 , pulsed radio emission from open field lines above the disk is not precluded by this model ( see e.g. michel 1991 , ch . 6 ) .",
    "more work is needed , however , to incorporate the effects of _ time - dependent _ magnetospheric accretion , as the accretion rate should gradually decrease with time as the disk dissipates ( cannizzo , lee & goodman 1990 ) .",
    "propeller - based spin - down models incorporating a time - dependent @xmath61 have been proposed for axps ( chatterjee , hernquist & narayan 2000 ) , but this model did not include mdr spin - down torque , which may be significant for older pulsars ( such as b1757 - 24 ) and pulsars with small initial @xmath61 .",
    "if a significant fraction of pulsars are born with accretion disks , then there may be a population of older pulsars  whose disks have dissipated  with abnormally _ long _ mdr timing ages . from just the simple model considered here ,",
    "spin - down models incorporating propeller torques hold much promise for reconciling the supernova remnant ages and the timing parameters of pulsars .",
