    "the _ cohomological field theories _ have been aaplied to enumerative problems of algebraic geometry .",
    "general definitions and properties of cohomology of lie algebras and superalgebras are described in  @xcite .",
    "let us recall briefly some basic definitions .",
    "a _ lie superalgebra _ is a @xmath1-graded algebra over a commutative ring @xmath2 with a unit : @xmath3 \\in l_{\\alpha + \\beta}\\ ] ] the elements of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are called _ even _ and _ odd _ , respectively .",
    "we shall assume @xmath2 is one of the fields @xmath6 or @xmath7 . by definition ,",
    "the _ lie product _",
    "( shortly , _ bracket _ ) @xmath8 $ ] satisfies the following axioms @xmath9 = -(-1)^{p(u)p(v ) } [ v , u ] , &   { \\qquad \\mbox{skew - symmetry } , } \\label{ss_s } \\\\ & [ u,[v , w ] ] = [ [ u , v],w ] + ( -1)^{p(u)p(v ) } [ v,[u , w ] ] , & { \\qquad \\mbox{jacobi\\ identity},}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the parity of element @xmath11 .    a _ module _ over a lie",
    "superalgebra @xmath12 is a vector space @xmath13 ( over the same field @xmath2 ) with a mapping @xmath14 , such that @xmath15 m = a_1 ( a_2 m ) - ( -1)^{p(a_1)p(a_2 ) } a_2 ( a_1 m)$ ] , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the most important for our purposes are _ trivial _",

    "the super skew - symmetry means symmetry w.r.t .",
    "transpositions of odd adjacent elements of @xmath12 and antisymmetry for all other transpositions of adjacent elements .",
    "elements of @xmath22 are called _ cochains_.    the linear mapping @xmath23 ( or , briefly , @xmath29 ) is called the _ differential _ and satisfies the following property : @xmath30 ( or @xmath31 ) .",
    "the cochains mapped into zero by the differential are called the _ cocycles _ , i.e. , the space of cocycles is @xmath32    the cochains which can be represented as differentials of other cochains are called the _ coboundaries _ , i.e. , the space of coboundaries is @xmath33 any coboundary is obviously a cocycle .    the non - trivial cocycles , i.e. , those which are not coboundaries , form the _ cohomology_. in other words , the cohomology is the quotient space @xmath34    the explicit form of the differential for a lie superalgebra is @xmath35,\\ldots ,      \\widehat{e_j},\\ldots , e_q;o_{q+1},\\ldots , o_k)\\ + & \\\\ & ( -1)^{q+1}{\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{q}}{\\sum\\limits_{j = q+1}^{k}}c(e_0,\\ldots , e_{i-1},[e_i , o_j],\\ldots ,     e_q;o_{q+1},\\ldots,\\widehat{o_j},\\ldots , o_k)\\ + & \\\\ & ( -1)^{i+1}{\\sum\\limits_{i = q+1}^{k-1}}{\\sum\\limits_{j = q+2}^{k}}c(e_0,\\ldots , e_q;o_{q+1},\\ldots ,     o_{i-1},[o_i , o_j],\\ldots,\\widehat{o_j},\\ldots , o_k ) & \\\\ & + { \\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{q}}(-1)^{i+1 } e_i     c(e_0,\\ldots,\\widehat{e_i},\\ldots , e_q;o_{q+1},\\ldots , o_k ) & \\\\ & + \\ ( -1)^q { \\sum\\limits_{i = q+1}^{k } } o_i     c(e_0,\\ldots , e_q;o_{q+1},\\ldots,\\widehat{o_i},\\ldots , o_k ) . &",

    "are some properties and statements we use in the sequel .",
    "an algebra and a module are called _ graded _ if they can be presented as sums of homogeneous components in a way compatible with the algebra bracket and the action of the algebra on the module : @xmath39 \\subset a_{g_1+g_2 } , \\ ; a_{g_1}m_{g_2 } \\subset m_{g_1+g_2},\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is some abelian ( semi)group .",
    "we assume @xmath41 in this paper . to avoid confusion",
    ", we use in the sequel the terms _ grade _ and _ degree _ for element of @xmath40 and number of cochain arguments , respectively .",
    "the grading in the algebra and module induces a grading on cochains and , hence , in the cohomology : @xmath42 this property allows one to compute the cohomology separately for different homogeneous components ; this is especially useful when the homogeneous components are finite  dimensional .    if there is an element @xmath43 , such that eigenvectors of the operator @xmath44 $ ] form a ( topological ) basis of algebra @xmath12 , then @xmath45 in other words , all the non - trivial cocycles of the cohomology in the trivial module lie in the zero grade component . the element @xmath46 is called an _ internal grading element_. if also eigenvectors of the operator @xmath47 form a topological basis of module @xmath13 , then the same statement holds for the cohomology in the module @xmath13 : @xmath48    in the case of trivial module , the exterior multiplication of cochains provides the cohomology with a structure of graded ring",
    ". there are also another multiplicative structures in cohomology , but we shall not use them in this work .",
    "to compute the cohomology one needs to solve the equation @xmath49 and throw away those solutions of ( [ dck ] ) which can be expressed in the form @xmath50 in some exceptional cases it is possible to solve equation ( [ dck ] ) in closed form .",
    "often , in the case of lie superalgebras of vector fields , determining equation ( [ dck ] ) is a system of linear homogeneous functional equations with integer arguments .",
    "unfortunately there is no general method for solving such systems in closed form .",
    "hence , we need to carry out the corresponding computation  numerically \" .",
    "there are several packages for computing cohomology of lie algebras and superalgebras written in _ reduce _",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite and _ mathematica _  @xcite . some new results were obtained completely or partially with the help of these packages . however , these packages , being based on general purpose computer algebra systems , appeared to be too inefficient for large real problems . in view of this",
    ", we wrote the program in c language  @xcite .",
    "the c code , of total length near 14000 lines , contains about 300 functions realizing top level algorithms , simplification of indexed objects , working with grassmannian objects , exterior calculus , linear algebra , substitutions , list processing , input and output , etc . as internal structures we use 8 types of lists for different objects .",
    "we represent grassmann monomials by integer numbers using one - to - one correspondence between ( binary codes of ) non - negative integers and grassmann monomials .",
    "this representation allows one efficiently to implement the operations with grassmann monomials by means of the basic computer commands .",
    "the program performs sequentially the following steps :    1 .   _ reading input information .",
    "_ 2 .   _ constructing a basis _ for the algebra .",
    "the basis can be read from the input file ; otherwise the program constructs it from the definition of the algebra .",
    "non - trivial computations at this step arise only in the case of divergence - free algebras .",
    "the basis elements of such algebras should satisfy some conditions .",
    "in fact , we should construct the basis elements of a subspace given by a system of linear equations .",
    "the task is thereby reduced to some problem of linear algebra combined with shifts of indices .",
    "for example , among the divergence - free conditions for the _ special buttin",
    "_ algebra @xmath51 there are the following two equations @xmath52 @xmath53 here @xmath54 are coefficients at the monomials @xmath55 in the generating function ; @xmath56 and @xmath57 are even and odd variables , respectively .",
    "first of all , we have to shift indices @xmath58 and @xmath26 in the second equation to reduce the last terms of both equations to the same multiindices .",
    "then , using some simple tricks of linear algebra , we can easily construct the corresponding basis element @xmath59 3 .",
    "_ constructing the commutator table _ for the algebra ( if this table has not been read from the input file ) .",
    "4 .   _ creating the general form _ of expressions for coboundaries and determining equations for cocycles . 5 .",
    "_ transition to a particular grade _ in general expressions . at this step expressions for coboundaries",
    "take the form @xmath60 , equations for cocycles take the form @xmath61 , where vector @xmath62 corresponds to @xmath22 , parameter vector @xmath63 corresponds to @xmath64 , matrices @xmath65 correspond to the differential @xmath29 .",
    "all these vector spaces are finite - dimensional for any particular grade . 6 .   _ computing the quotient space @xmath66_. here cocycle subspace @xmath67",
    "is given by relations @xmath61 , and coboundary subspace @xmath68 is given parametrically by @xmath60 .",
    "+ substeps : 1 .",
    "eliminate @xmath63 from @xmath60 to get equations @xmath69 2 .",
    "reduce both relations @xmath69 and @xmath61 to the canonical form by gauss elimination .",
    "if @xmath70 , then there is no non - trivial cocycle ; otherwise go to substep ( c ) .",
    "3 .   set @xmath71 and substitute these relations into @xmath61 to get relations @xmath72 .",
    "the _ parametric _",
    "( non - leading ) @xmath73s of the last relations are non - trivial cocycles ; that is , they form a basis of the cohomology .",
    "+ in fact , the above procedure is based on the relation for quotient spaces @xmath74 where @xmath75 is an artificially introduced space combining the above @xmath76s and @xmath73s .",
    "_ output the non - trivial cocycles .",
    "to define the formal vector fields on the supermanifold of the superdimension @xmath77 we consider the sets of even @xmath78 and odd ( called also _ grassmann _ ) @xmath79 variables , and formal power series @xmath80 in these variables .",
    "these power series are called _ generating functions , _ because the vector fields considered in this work can be expressed in terms of the derivatives of @xmath81 the ( super)commutator of vector fields induces the bracket on generating functions .",
    "the lie superalgebra of _ poisson _ vector fields @xmath82 is a set of generating functions with the bracket @xmath83 the _ hamiltonian _ superalgebra is a quotient algebra of the poisson algebra with respect to its center : @xmath84 observe that @xmath85 is not simple ; it has a simple ideal of codimension 1 denoted by @xmath86 and called _ special hamiltonian superalgebra_. the algebra @xmath86 contains the subalgebra @xmath87 and this fact can be used for analysis of the structure of the cohomology ring @xmath88 .",
    "note that all the algebras depending only on the odd variables are finite - dimensional .",
    "it does not mean however that their cohomologies are finite - dimensional too .",
    "all the above algebras are graded due to prescribed grading of the variables .",
    "the _ standard _ grading assumes all variables @xmath89 have the grade 1 .",
    "in the below tables and formulas we use the small @xmath90 and capital @xmath91 letters for even and odd cocycles , respectively . the optional superscript and subscript indicate the cochain degree and grade , correspondingly .",
    "the letters without indices denote the genuine cocycles , i.e. , generating elements of the cohomology ring . empty position in the tables",
    "means the absence of non - trivial cocycles in the given degree and grade .",
    "the columns containing only trivial cocycles are omitted .",
    "we use the notations @xmath92 for even and @xmath93 for odd variables of the vector field generating functions .      .@xmath94",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      if we add the grading element @xmath40 to the algebra then the non - trivial cocycles lie in zero grade only . in this case",
    "the space of cochains is finite - dimensional and we can compute the full cohomology . thus , let s consider the algebras @xmath97 and @xmath98 the cohomologies @xmath99 and @xmath100 are grassmann algebras of the superdimension @xmath101 .",

    "the computation of cohomology is a typical problem with the combinatorial explosion .",
    "nevertheless , some results can be obtained with the help of computer having an efficient enough program . on the other hand ,",
    "physicists are interested mainly in the second cohomologies describing the central extensions and deformations .",
    "such cohomologies can be computed rather easily even for large algebras .",
