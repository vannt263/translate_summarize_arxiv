    "magnetic reconnection has been discussed as one of the important mechanisms for the rapid energy conversion of stored free magnetic energy to plasma energy .",
    "one of the most famous phenomena associated with magnetic reconnection is the solar flare .",
    "a solar flare is a sudden brightening observed in almost all wavelengths .",
    "the total amount of energy released by a flare is huge and it often reaches 10@xmath3 erg within an hour .",
    "considerable efforts have been devoted toward understanding the physical mechanism of solar flares , and several mechanisms have been proposed over the several decades .",
    "nowadays , the standard flare model which is based on magnetic reconnection , namely cshkp model @xcite , is widely believed , and modern telescope have confirmed the predicted characteristics from the model ( e.g. , cusp - like structure in soft x - ray images @xcite , reconnection inflows @xcite , reconnection outflows ( off limb@xcite , on disc @xcite ) , plasmoid ejection @xcite , and coronal mass ejections @xcite ) .",
    "recently , solar atmosphere has been focused as a space laboratory for magnetic reconnection because of its variety in plasma condition . actually , with the solar atmosphere",
    ", we can cover from low @xmath4 ( @xmath5 1 ) to high @xmath4 ( @xmath6 1 ) , weakly ionized to fully ionized , and collisional to collisionless plasma .",
    "observing magnetic reconnection in various plasma conditions is physically interesting in the field of not only solar physics but also other plasma physics .",
    "especially , in the solar corona , weak coulomb collisions can affect the plasma dynamics ( e.g. , thermal conduction , radiative cooling , ionization and recombination ) .",
    "in such a plasma condition , thermal conduction have an important role for energy transport during the explosive events .",
    "the plasma dynamics of magnetic reconnection with heat conduction is different from that without heat conduction .",
    "for example , the adiabatic slow - mode shocks predicted by petschek @xcite might be isothermal shocks by the heat conduction effects @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the thermal conduction effect can carry the energy to larger scale . according to the cshkp model ,",
    "the released magnetic energy stored in the solar corona is mainly transported to the chromosphere by the thermal conduction and the non - thermal electrons @xcite . with this process",
    "the chromospheric plasma is suddenly heated , and a localized high pressure region is formed .",
    "the pressure - gradient force drives the dense plasma to flow up toward the corona along the magnetic fields .",
    "this upflow is called chromospheric evaporation .",
    "the observational studies on evaporation have been done for several decades .",
    "a key piece of evidence for chromospheric evaporation is the detection of fast upflows in a high temperature plasma .",
    "the first observation of chromospheric evaporation was done by the bragg crystal spectrometer ( bcs ) on _ p78 - 1 _ @xcite , and much work has been done based on the spacecraft observation @xcite such as _ solar maximum mission , hinotori , _ and _ yohkoh _ , _ solar heliospheric observatory _ , _ hinode _ , and _ interface region imaging spectrograph_. recently , the temperature dependence of chromospheric evaporation is intensively studied .",
    "inspection of the temperature dependent observation reveals several interesting characteristics of chromospheric evaporation .",
    "for example , the modern observation showed that the temperature of the point separating upflows and downflows ( the flow reversal temperature ) is located at @xmath7 1 mk .",
    "however , some observations show that the flow reversal temperature locates even higher temperature during the impulsive phase @xcite .",
    "recently , to understand these observational facts the numerical modelings are also intensively performed .",
    "@xcite discussed self consistently combined fokker - planck modeling of energetic electrons and hydrodynamic simulation of flare .",
    "they compared the results between conductive heating dominant case and direct energetic electron heating dominant case and found that the flow reversal temperature tend to be lower when conductive heating dominates over direct electron heating .",
    "because the energy input location is different between thermal conduction and energetic electron precipitation , the location of the flow reversal temperature also different in height .",
    "they also mentioned that the unusual high temperature ( 2mk ) downflow ( @xmath8 km sec@xmath9 ) without energetic electron is due to the thermal expansion early in the corona .",
    "brannon & longcope @xcite successfully reproduce the observed flow reversal temperature by 1d hydrodynamic simulation omitting gravity effect . because they omit gravity , the solar atmosphere is not stratified .",
    "it is not clear whether the observed flow reversal temperature can be reproduced when they take into account the gravity effect .",
    "the flow reversal temperature becomes one of the hot topics in the field of the solar physics .",
    "on 6 november 2010 , hinode @xcite observed a solar flare ( goes m5.4 , peak time 15:27 ) at the southeast ( 20@xmath10 s , 58@xmath10 e ) .",
    "the euv imaging spectrometer ( eis ) on board hinode is a high spectral / spatial resolution spectrometer aimed at studying dynamic phenomena in the corona @xcite .",
    "the flare we observed were obtained with flare study ( hh_flare_180x160_v2 ) .",
    "eis performed a coarse raster scan ( 2 arcseconds slit and 5 arcseconds step with 8 sec exposure : sparse raster ) with about 6 minutes cadence over this flaring active region ( noaa 11121 ) starting before the flare , and the flare occurred during the scan .",
    "eis data from the raster are processed using the eis team provided software , which corrects for the flat field , dark current , cosmic rays , hot pixels , and slit tilt . for thermal reasons , there is an orbital variation of the line position causing an artificial doppler shift of @xmath1120 km s@xmath9 which follows a sinusoidal behavior .",
    "this orbital variation of the line position was corrected using the house keeping data @xcite .",
    "eis successfully observed the foot point of the flare , where the chromospheric evaporation occurs , during the impulsive phase of the flare .",
    "eis obtained euv images and line - of - sight ( los ) velocities estimated by doppler shift in several emission lines ( e.g. , fe  xii , fe  xv , fe  xxiii ) . by using these emission lines",
    ", we can discuss the temperature dependence of the chromospheric evaporation upflow / condensation downflow during the flare from a few @xmath12 to @xmath13 k. simultaneously , the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo)/atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) instrument acquired full - sun images with a spatial resolution of  1000 km .",
    "we use the aia 193    passband to study the temporal evolution of the flare @xcite .",
    "_ reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager _ ( rhessi ) also observed the early phase of flare .",
    "the energetic electron ( @xmath6 25 kev ) enhancement was not observed , although the moderate - energy electron ( @xmath7 10 kev ) enhancement was observed during the early phase of the flare ( not shown here ) .",
    "the non - thermal electron acceleration might be weak in this event .",
    "unfortunately , rhessi could not observe the main phase of flare because of night time .",
    "figure 1 shows the flare image of aia 193    channel at the impulsive ( 1a ) and the peak ( 1b ) phase .",
    "the light curve of goes 1.0 - 8.0 and 0.5 - 4.0    are also shown in figure 1c .",
    "the dashed vertical lines show the acquired time of the aia images ( a : impulsive , b : peak ) . during the impulsive phase",
    ", we can clearly see the two bright points at @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "it seems that these bright points represents the two footpoints of the flaring loop .",
    "figure 1a represents the very beginning of the flare , because the bright points are limited in space .",
    "we can clearly observe the flare arcades at the peak time of the goes light curve in figure 1b , @xmath74 minutes later from figure 1a .",
    "there are no clear bright points in figure 1b any more .",
    "figure 2 shows the intensity ( top : a - c ) and los velocity ( bottom : d - f ) images of fe  xii ( @xmath16k ) , fe  xv ( @xmath17k ) , and fe  xxiii ( @xmath18k ) during the impulsive phase of the flare .",
    "the slit scanning starts from 15:28:08 ut , and the slit is located at the flaring region during the impulsive phase .",
    "we can also see the bright points in figure 2a - b , which we already discussed in figure 1a . on the other hand , fe  xxiii intensity image , which generally represents the hot flaring plasma , shows the flare loop which connects two brights in figure 2a - b .",
    "this result indicates that the bright points certainly locate at the footpoints of the flaring loop .",
    "the los velocity in fe  xii at the footpoint of the flaring loop during the impulsive phase shows a few 10 km sec@xmath9 downflow .",
    "the fe  xv doppler image ( figure 2d ) also shows that the redshift reaches 50 km sec@xmath9 . on the other hand ,",
    "the fe  xxiii doppler image ( figure 2f ) shows the @xmath7 50 km sec@xmath9 upflow .",
    "we can see the temperature dependent flows of the chromospheric evaporation .    from figure 2 , we find the dependence of flow on temperature .",
    "to understand this dependence in detail , we analyze the line profiles more carefully .",
    "figure 3a - g show the line profiles of o  vi ( 184.12  , @xmath19k ) , fe  x ( 184.54  , @xmath20k ) , fe  xii ( 192.39  , @xmath21k ) , fe  xiv ( 264.79  , @xmath22k ) , fe  xv ( 284.16  , @xmath22k ) , fe  xvi(262.98  , @xmath17k ) , and fe  xxiii ( 263.77  , @xmath23k ) with a single gaussian fitting , respectively .",
    "the line profiles in figure 3 are obtained at the x - mark position in figure 2 .",
    "the dashed lines show the line center wavelength of stationary component for each emission lines .",
    "the dotted lines represent the line center wavelength estimated by single gaussian fitting .",
    "we can clearly see that the all line profiles are redshifted ( dashed line @xmath5 dotted line ) except fe  xxiii ( figure 3 g ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the summary of temperature dependence of the chromospheric evaporation upflow / condensation downflow during the impulsive phase of the flare .",
    "interestingly , the strongest redshift is observed in fe  xv emission line which generally represents the hot loops of the active region .",
    "figure 5 shows the eis observation of the peak phase of the flare .",
    "we can not see the bright points anymore , and the well - developed flare arcades are clearly observed .",
    "the blueshift component in fe  xxiii ( arrow in figure 5c ) which observed the boundary of the flare arcade might be related to the evaporation upflow .",
    "the strong redshift can not be observed in fe  xii or fe  xv any more .",
    "therefore , we think that the strong redshift in hot emission line can be observed at the footpoint of the flare loop only during the impulsive phase .",
    "we have shown the hinode / eis observation of chromospheric evaporation upflow and condensation downflow during the flare .",
    "the observation shows that we can observe the strong downflows of hot plasma ( a few mk ) during the impulsive phase of the flare . in this section ,",
    "we carry out two numerical modelings ( case1 : thermal conduction dominant , case2 : enthalpy flux dominant ) in order to understand the observed strong downflow during the impulsive phase .",
    "the calculations discussed in this paper were carried out using the 1d version of the numerical package cans ( coordinated astronomical numerical software ; http://www-space.eps.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/  yokoyama / etc / cans/ ) .",
    "recently , imada _",
    "@xcite pointed out that ionization can not reach equilibrium in some part of flaring region because of its fast flow and rapid heating .",
    "it is important to take into account time - dependent ionization process when we interpret the observation of flare associated phenomena .",
    "thus , we have combined the time - dependent ionization code with 1d version of the numerical package .",
    "the simulation setup is almost the same as imada & zweibel @xcite .",
    "a fixed semi circular single magnetic loop with a constant cross section is assumed .",
    "we assume the half - length of the loop ( l ) is 26 mm .",
    "the dynamics in only half of the loop using a 1d single fluid hydrodynamic ( hd ) code are calculated , because the symmetry about the loop top can be assumed .",

    "all of the doppler shift contribution parameter , @xmath88 , of fe  xii , fe  xv , and fe  xxiii also show the positive ( blueshift ) value .",
    "therefore , the observed strong downflow in fe  xii and fe  xv emission line during the impulsive phase can not be reproduced by the chromospheric evaporation calculation in the thermal conduction dominant regime .      in the previous subsection",
    "we clearly show that the chromospheric evaporation calculation in the thermal conduction dominant regime can not reproduce the observed strong downflow in fe  xii and fe  xv emission line during the impulsive phase .",

    "surprisingly , in figure 9 , both of the doppler shift contribution parameter , @xmath88 , of fe  xii and fe  xv show the negative value , which means that the redshift component should be observed in these emission lines .",
    "the redshift component is stronger when the time - dependent ionization are taken into account .",
    "figure 10 shows the result of 80 second later from the beginning .",
    "the figure format is the same as figure 7 . even in this enthalpy flux dominant regime , the chromospheric evaporation flows",
    "are well developed , and the highest velocity also reaches 250 km sec@xmath9 .",

    "the doppler shift contribution parameters of fe  xii and fe  xv show both positive and negative value , although that of fe  xxiii show the positive value .",
    "therefore , the strong downflow in fe  xii and fe  xv can be observed only the beginning of the flare at the base of flaring loop .",
    "we have studied the chromospheric evaporation flow during the impulsive phase of the flare by using the hinode / eis observation .",
    "we have also preform the numerical simulation of 1d hydrodynamics with time - dependent ionization .",
    "the observation clearly shows that the strong redshift can be observed at the base of the flaring loop only during the impulsive phase .",
    "we perform the two different numerical simulations to reproduce the strong downflows in fe  xii and fe  xv during the impulsive phase . by changing the thermal conduction coefficient ,",
    "we carry out the numerical calculation of chromospheric evaporation in the thermal conduction dominant regime ( @xmath0 classical value ) and the enthalpy flux dominant regime ( @xmath1 0.1@xmath2classical value ) .",
    "the chromospheric evaporation calculation in the enthalpy flux dominant regime can only reproduce the strong redshift at the base of the flare during the impulsive phase .",
    "this result might indicate that the thermal conduction can be suppressed in some cases of the flare .",
    "we also find that time - dependent ionization effect is importance to reproduce the strong downflows in fe  xii and fe  xv .",
    "let us discuss why the chromospheric evaporation calculation in the thermal conduction dominant regime can not reproduce the strong redshift in fe  xii and fe  xv .",
    "the solar atmosphere are gravitationally stratified , and the sharp temperature and density gradient region , so called transition region , is formed in between corona and chromosphere . in the thermal conduction",
    "dominant regime , the released energy by flare is conducted along the field line from loop top to the chromosphere .",
    "the heat from solar corona violates the pressure balance of the gravitationally stratified atmosphere .",
    "the thermal conduction can carry only the energy , and the dense plasma is suddenly heated to form a localized high pressure region .",
    "the localized high pressure region should be formed at the transition region which has a large jump in temperature and density .",
    "this is the reason why the flow reversal temperature locates at the transition region temperature in the thermal conduction regime . on the other hand , in the case of the enthalpy flux dominant regime ,",
    "the plasma energy and momentum are mainly transported by pressure - driven downflow from flare region to transition region simultaneously .",
    "therefore , the bottom part of the flare loop is hit and heated by this downflow .",
    "this process can produce the strong downflow in fe  xii and fe  xv at the base of flare loop during the impulsive phase .",
    "finally , we discuss the possibility that the thermal conduction can be suppressed in some cases of the flare .",
    "the classical thermal conduction in a fully ionized hydrogen plasma is based on the assumption that the mean free path is enough shorter than the characteristic temperature scale height in the solar corona . in the case that the mean free path becomes comparable to or even greater than the temperature scale height , the normal diffusion approximation for the heat flux breaks down@xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the case of solar flare , the large structure of magnetic reconnection can also contribute to suppress the thermal conduction effect .",
    "the loss - cone angle of hot electron in the reconnection region is small because of the large magnetic field gradient between upstream and downstream of reconnection region .",
    "the free streaming electron along the magnetic field from reconnection region to outside might be limited in a collisonless plasma .",
    "suppression mechanism of thermal conduction during a solar flare is important future work .",
    "hinode is a japanese mission developed and launched by isas / jaxa , with naoj as a domestic partner and nasa and stfc ( uk ) as international partners .",
    "it is operated by these agencies in co - operation with esa and nsc ( norway ) .",

    "<S> we have studied the chromospheric evaporation flow during the impulsive phase of the flare by using the hinode / eis observation and 1d hydrodynamic numerical simulation coupled to the time - dependent ionization . </S>",
    "<S> the observation clearly shows that the strong redshift can be observed at the base of the flaring loop only during the impulsive phase . </S>",
    "<S> we performed two different numerical simulations to reproduce the strong downflows in fexii and fexv during the impulsive phase . by changing the thermal conduction coefficient </S>",
    "<S> , we carried out the numerical calculation of chromospheric evaporation in the thermal conduction dominant regime ( conductivity coefficient @xmath0 classical value ) and the enthalpy flux dominant regime ( @xmath1 0.1@xmath2classical value ) . </S>",
    "<S> the chromospheric evaporation calculation in the enthalpy flux dominant regime could reproduce the strong redshift at the base of the flare during the impulsive phase . </S>",
    "<S> this result might indicate that the thermal conduction can be strongly suppressed in some cases of flare . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that time - dependent ionization effect is importance to reproduce the strong downflows in fe  xii and fe  xv . </S>"
