    "experimentally , this can be achieved by using atomic species with a different polarizability so that only the impurities are trapped by an optical lattice or microtraps @xcite while the fermions in the bath remain mobile .      in ultracold atoms ,",

    "the measurement of the crossover of exponential decay rates of the ramsey signal @xmath7 from subleading- to leading - branch dynamics can be an experimental challenge due to small ramsey contrast . in fig .",
    "[ fig.crossoversubleading ] in the main text , we have shown an example where the crossover takes place at relatively long times @xmath116 . there , the parameters were chosen so that oscillations due to bottom - of - the band excitations at short times are damped out in the crossover regime . at the correspondingly long times ,",
    "the ramsey contrast @xmath272 became inaccessibly small for experiments .",
    "however , the precise time at which the crossover takes place , as well as the corresponding magnitude of the ramsey signal , is highly sensitive to the specific interaction parameters chosen .",
    "hence , more favorable ramsey contrast can easily be achieved by choosing only slightly modified parameters .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ fig.highcontrast ] we show the ramsey contrast where , compared to fig .  [ fig.crossoversubleading ]",
    ", the temperature is increased from @xmath189 to @xmath282 and where @xmath38 is changed from @xmath487 to @xmath488 .",
    "this slight variation already yields an increase of the ramsey contrast in the interference region by six orders of magnitude .",
    "this demonstrates that parameters can be optimized to bring the observation of the subleading to leading branch dynamics within reach of experimental precision .     as function of time .",
    "interaction parameters are chosen to correspond to the two - channel regime ( b ) .",
    "compare to fig .",
    "[ fig.crossoversubleading ] , we choose slightly different parameters , @xmath282 , @xmath489 , and @xmath490 .",
    "the solid line shows the exact numerical evaluation of the dynamical overlap @xmath7 using the fda , while the dotted ( dashed ) line shows exponentials with the analytically predicted exponents @xmath255 ( @xmath256 ) , see eq .  .",
    "as outlined in section [ sec_decoh ] , analytical expressions for the different branches of the fermi - surface contribution @xmath210 may be obtained by choosing different integration contours @xmath313 in eq .",
    "( [ contouromega ] ) , which , for convenience , we state here again , @xmath491\\ , , \\ ] ] where , using the explicit form of fermi distribution function , the symbol @xmath311 is given by @xmath492 the derivation of the contours follows from an argument based on analytic continuation : the leading branch is given by the szeg formula , leading to eq .  , while the subleading branch can be obtained by analytically continuing contours from a neighboring interaction regime where the corresponding branch is leading .",
    "first , we consider the _ leading _ branches . in the upper panels of fig .  [ fig.contours ]",
    ", we show as solid lines the contours for the evaluation of the leading branch in the three interaction regimes ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) ( according to table [ tab.branches ] ) .",
    "the corresponding trajectories of @xmath311 in the complex plane are shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig.contours ] as a function of the real variable @xmath144 ranging from @xmath493 to @xmath494 ( assuming low temperature @xmath495 ) . in the regimes",
    "( a ) and ( c ) , those trajectories do not encircle zero , and the asymptotics of the corresponding toeplitz determinant follows from the conventional szeg formula .",
    "in other words , the leading branch @xmath258 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : integralomegagamma ] ) with the usual integration along the real axis .    at the transition between the regimes ( b ) and ( c ) , only scattering deeply below the fermi surface is modified .",
    "therefore we deduce that the leading branch in the regime ( b ) is also given by an integration along the real axis .",
    "as discussed in section [ sectoeplitz ] , the branch of the logarithm is continued analytically along the contour , with the boundary condition @xmath496 . in the interaction regime ( b )",
    "we denote the leading branch as @xmath259 .",
    "this change of notation with respect to the leading branch contribution @xmath258 in regimes ( a ) and ( c ) reflects that on passing from the regime ( c ) to the regime ( b ) , we re - integrate the empty bound or bottom of the band state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.illustration ] ) into a hole near the bottom of the fermi sea : as a consequence , the state without an extra particle at the fermi surface in the regime ( c ) is interpreted as a state with one extra particle at the fermi surface in the regime ( b ) , hence the nomenclature @xmath259 .",
    "note that the physical oscillation frequency is indeed continuous across the transition : while the shift of @xmath231 by @xmath497 ( see fig .  [ fig.phaseshift ] ) leads to a decrease of @xmath305 by @xmath107 , this energy is compensated by an additional contribution of @xmath107 from the hole at the bottom of the fermi sea .",
    "we now turn to the _ subleading _ branches . in order to obtain the corresponding integration contours ,",
    "we examine first the transition between the regimes ( a ) and ( b ) . at this transition",
    ", a zero @xmath316 of @xmath311 ( and hence a logarithmic branching point of the integrand ) crosses the real axis of @xmath144 .",
    "the analytical continuity of the branches prescribes that they may be obtained by the same integrals ( [ contouromega ] ) , but with the contours deformed to accommodate for the shift of the zero of @xmath311 , so that the integrand stays continuously on the same branch of the logarithm . in this way",
    ", we find the subleading branch in the regime ( b ) as a continuation of the leading branch in the regime ( a ) and the subleading branch in the regime ( a ) as a continuation of the leading branch in the regime ( b ) . the corresponding integration contours for the subleading branches are shown in the upper panels of fig",
    ".  [ fig.contours ] as dashed lines : they deviate from the real axis to go around the zero of @xmath311 ( and end up on a different branch of the logarithm , with respect to the integrand for the leading branch of their respective interaction regime ) .",
    "finally , the subleading branch in the regime ( c ) is given by the same type of contour as in the regime ( b ) for the same reason as for the leading branch .",
    "for the calculation of integrals for the subleading branches , leading to the expressions eq .  , the contour deviations from the real axis can be chosen to be perpendicular to it , so that the contour retraces itself on the way back , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.contours ] . the universal jump of the logarithm of @xmath498 between the two branches then yields the result ( [ eq : sublead ] ) .",

    "<S> we rely on three complementary approaches : ( 1 ) functional determinants give an exact numerical solution for time- and frequency - resolved responses , ( 2 ) bosonization provides accurate analytical expressions at low temperatures , and ( 3 ) the theory of toeplitz determinants allows us to analytically predict response up to high temperatures . using these approaches we calculated the thermal decoherence rate of the fermionic system and we prove that , within the considered model , the fastest rate of long - time decoherence is given by @xmath0 . we show that feshbach resonances in cold atomic systems give access to new interaction regimes where quantum effects can prevail even in the thermal regime of many - body dynamics . the key signature of this phenomenon is a crossover between different exponential decay rates of the real - time ramsey signal . we show that the physics of the orthogonality catastrophe can be observed in a power - law dependence of thermal spectral weight on temperature that is reminiscent of the physics of heavy ions in liquid @xmath1he and that is experimentally observable at temperatures @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> our results are in excellent agreement with recent experiments on lik mixtures , and we predict several phenomena that can be tested using currently available experimental technology . </S>"
