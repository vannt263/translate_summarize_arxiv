    "they are thus superbly suited to study the kinematics of the galaxy , especially for stars that populate a local volume .",

    "we convert the proper motions into tangential velocities . for individual stars , tangential velocities alone do not allow the construction of space velocity components because the radial velocities are missing .",
    "however , @xcite have shown that , by making use of the many viewing angles through the velocity distribution of stars over a large fraction of the sky , the characteristic moments of the velocity distribution can be determined in a statistical manner . following this method , we are able to determine empirically , for the first time with high precision , the first and second moments of the velocity distribution of local stars as a function of height above the galactic midplane .    our paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe the sample selection and our methods for obtaining distances and deriving tangential velocities . in ",
    "3 we apply the statistical approach of @xcite to reconstruct the moments of the three - dimensional velocity distribution of stars from their tangential velocities .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  4 .",
    "in order to obtain a sample of stars that are representative of the old , relaxed population dominated by the thin disk of the milky way , we have extracted from the _ sdss dr-7 _ database all objects classified as stars in the _ de - reddened _ color range @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and with apparent magnitudes @xmath26 ( cf .",
    "these stars have spectral types m0 and later .",
    "the upper cutoff at @xmath22 = 20.5 mag , which corresponds to @xmath27 = 19.5 mag , is necessary because the proper motions are seriously contaminated by misidentifications at fainter magnitudes ( lepine 2008 , internal sdss memorandum ) .",
    "we have selected only stars with non - zero proper motion errors , apparent magnitude errors @xmath28 0.05 mag in the @xmath29 bands , and which were not flagged for any known astrometric or photometric peculiarities .",
    "this resulted in a sample of about 2.6 million stars ( mean age expected to be @xmath145 gyr ) .",
    "we have determined a photometric distance estimate for each star using the absolute magnitude - color relations of @xcite .",
    "we have compared both the ` faint ' and ` bright ' normalizations with color - magnitude relations by @xcite and @xcite . @xcite have observed m stars drawn from the _ catalogue of nearby stars _",
    "@xcite , for which trigonometric parallaxes are available , in the @xmath16 filter system . @xcite",
    "have selected m dwarfs from the _ third data release of the sloan digital sky survey _ @xcite and determined spectroscopic parallaxes of these stars .",
    "if we use fits to the @xcite or @xcite data as distance estimators in the de - projection formalism ( described below ) to obtain the first and second moments of the velocity distribution of the stars , we find that the results are practically indistinguishable from the results based on the @xcite bright normalization .",
    "we conclude that this normalization is thus well suited to serve as a photometric distance estimator for red main sequence stars in the galactic thin disk , such as m dwarfs , @xmath30 as explained below , we count m dwarfs up to distances reaching 800 pc above the galactic midplane . according to the model of the galactic thin and thick disks by @xcite , we expect about 13% of the m dwarfs close to the midplane to be thick - disk stars ; in the distance range of 600 to 800 pc above the midplane the fraction of thick disk stars , which are more metal - poor than thin disk stars , is expected to be about 36% .",
    "therefore , we have compared the faint and bright normalizations of @xcite with the fiducial line delineating the main sequence of the globular cluster m71 as observed by @xcite , transformed into the native @xmath16 system using the relations of @xcite , and assuming a distance modulus of @xmath31 = 13.02 .",
    "m71 has a metallicity of @xmath32 $ ] = -0.73 @xcite which is typical for the majority of thick - disk stars .",
    "this comparison shows that for metal - poor stars in the color range @xmath33 @xmath34 0.5 , photometric distances can be reliably determined using the faint normalization , @xmath35 in the following we provide results using both distance scales in order to demonstrate how ( little ) our results are systematically affected by the presence of thick - disk stars .",
    "the difference between the two calibrations is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] as function of de - reddened @xmath36 color .",
    "the right ascension and declination , taken together with the distance estimate , were used to calculate the position of each star in a cartesian reference system centered on the position of the sun , with the @xmath37-axis pointing toward the galactic center , the @xmath38-axis in the direction of galactic rotation , and the @xmath2-axis towards the galactic north pole , respectively .",
    "we then defined eight pill - box shaped counting volumes , oriented parallel to the galactic midplane and stacked onto each other .",
    "each volume has a vertical height of 100 pc and a radial size @xmath39 kpc .",
    "the midpoints of the counting volumes are centered on the galactocentric radius of the sun and @xmath2 = 50 , 150 , ... 750 pc , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] we have overlaid frequency distributions of the colors of stars in the distance bin closest to the galactic midplane and in the most distant bin , respectively , on the absolute magnitude differences between the faint and bright calibrations . these indicate which color ranges of the calibration of the absolute magnitudes are relevant in the various distance bins .",
    "[ fig0c ] shows the frequency distributions of the proper motions in right ascension and declination for the stars in each counting volume .",
    "averaged over the entire sample the errors of the proper motions are @xmath40 and @xmath41 = 3.36 mas / year .",

    "[ eq1b ] @xmath43 denotes the total proper motion of each star in units of mas / year .",
    "even though the stars have been selected into the counting volumes according to their estimated distances , their reduced proper motions are to first order distance independent @xcite , and are thus also independent from the chosen distance scale .",
    "since m giants are intrinsically brighter ( by at least 9 magnitudes ) than m dwarfs , they would show up in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] in the lower flank of the distribution . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] , the contamination of our sample by such halo m giants is , as expected @xcite , negligible .",
    "[ fig0b ] shows the distribution of the selected stars as function of height above the galactic midplane versus their @xmath36 colors . as can be seen in this figure ,",
    "our sample is volume limited for stars bluer than @xmath44 ( with the exception of perhaps a few bright , very nearby stars ) . in the upper right portion of fig .",
    "[ fig0b ] , red m stars are missing whose apparent magnitudes are fainter than the magnitude limit of the survey .    returning to fig",
    ".  [ fig0 ] , we note a mild malmquist bias in our sample .",
    "the high altitude counting volumes are populated by comparatively more blue stars than red stars , and , given the apparent magnitude limits of the survey , the blue stars are on the average intrinsically brighter .    for each star we have calculated its tangential velocity from the proper motions and the photometric distances based on the bright normalization by @xcite .",
    "assuming zero line - of - sight velocities , we then computed three- dimensional space velocities .",
    "following the notation of @xcite , these are referred to as the proper motion velocities @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the velocity components are oriented in the same way as the spatial coordinates .",
    "finally , we rejected stars which had at least one single velocity component @xmath34 150 km / s .",
    "after application of this cut , our final sample comprises @xmath48 stars .",
    "their spatial distribution is shown in fig .",
    "the errors of the space velocity components were determined by application of a standard gaussian error propagation formalism .",
    "following @xcite , we have assumed individual relative distance errors of 20% , which corresponds to an error in the absolute magnitudes of 0.43 mag .",
    "these errors result in typical errors for the individual velocities of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 = 2.5(+2 , -1 ) km / s , 2.5(+3 , -1 ) km / s , and 1.5(+3,-1 ) km / s respectively , but with tails out to @xmath14 10 km / s . however , the individual errors are greatly diminished when one considers the large number of stars in each of our counting volumes .",
    "for instance , if we were to change the individual distance errors from 20 percent to 30 percent , the resulting first and second moments of the velocity distribution would be precisely the same as given in table 1 .",
    "the last step in the preparation of the data was the correction of each individual proper motion velocity for galactic mean rotation @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the distance of a star and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are galactic longitude and latitude , respectively . in this way we have constructed proper motion velocities that reflect the true peculiar velocities of the stars . for the oort constants @xmath56 and @xmath57 we adopt the values determined by @xcite , @xmath58 km / s / kpc and @xmath59 km / s / kpc .",
    "the proper motion velocities , which we have introduced in the previous section , are formally defined as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the unit vector pointing to the star under consideration , @xmath62 equation [ eq3 ] can be written as a set of algebraic equations @xmath63 the elements of the symmetric matrix @xmath64 are given in appendix a. the key assumption of the de - projection of the proper motion velocities is that the lines of sight towards the stars are statistically uncorrelated with the velocities of the stars @xcite .",
    "we thus take the statistical average of eq .",
    "[ eq5 ] over the samples in each counting volume , as defined above @xmath65 @xmath66 in contrast to eq .",
    "[ eq5 ] , which can not be inverted , eq .  [ eq6 ] can be inverted as @xmath67 which gives the three first moments of the velocity distribution .",
    "since we presume to have selected a sample from a relaxed population of stars in the galactic disk , @xmath6 and @xmath3 should reflect simply the solar motion relative to the standard of the rest , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 is , due to the asymmetry of the @xmath70 velocity distribution , more negative than @xmath71 .",
    "next we consider the second moments of the velocity distribution .",
    "the components of the proper motion velocity of each star can be combined as @xmath72 where the indices stand for @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "again we take the ensemble average @xmath75 which is manifestly symmetric in the indices @xmath76 .",
    "formally , we set up a set of algebraic equations @xmath77 since the lines of sight to the stars are statistically uncorrelated with their velocities , the matrix @xmath78 is also not singular , and allows for each @xmath2-slice the inversion @xmath79 the elements of matrix @xmath80 are also given in appendix a.    the velocity dispersions are given by @xmath81 and we have the mixed moments @xmath82 . in the definition of the latter , we have switched from @xmath83 to @xmath84 which is , for instance , more convenient to use with the jeans equations .",
    "it seems intuitive that this inversion should work for an all - sky sample , but less so in the case of the _ sdss _ coverage .",
    "in order to test that the sky coverage of the selected sample of stars is sufficient to reliably invert eqns .",
    "[ eq6 ] and [ eq10 ] , we have carried out a monte - carlo simulation .",

    "we have converted the space velocities to proper motion velocities and found that we could reconstruct , from just the samples contained in the _ sdss _ footprint , both the assumed velocity offsets and velocity dispersions to accuracies of 0.2 km / s , respectively .",
    "the de - projection procedure provides us with an observational estimate of the stellar velocity dispersion ellipsoid as a function of height above the galactic midplane .",

    "even the relaxed population of m - type stars represents an age mix of young and old stars .",

    "stars with larger vertical @xmath11 velocity dispersions can ascend higher into the galactic gravitational potential , so that one expects to find stars with higher velocity dispersions at greater heights above the midplane than closer to the midplane ( @xcite , @xcite ) . furthermore , our sample transitions with increasing height above the midplane from the old thin - disk to the thick- disk population .",
    "thick - disk stars have velocity dispersions on the order of @xmath106 = ( 45 - 65 , 40 - 50 , 30 - 40 ) km / s ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , which are only slightly larger than what we actually measure .",
    "we have estimated , from the 50% contour level of the velocity distribution of red clump giants at altitudes between 500 pc and 1500 pc above the midplane derived by @xcite with _ rave dr-2 _ data , velocity dispersions of about @xmath107 @xmath108 ( 79 , 56 , 35 ) km / s .",
    "the vertical velocity dispersion is consistent with our measurement in the highest altitude bin , whereas the planar velocity dispersions are significantly higher than our measurements , and , particularly in the @xmath83 velocity component , even higher than what is commonly ascribed to thick - disk stars .",
    "we note , however , that such high @xmath86 and @xmath87 dispersions are comparable with the velocity dispersions ascribed by @xcite to the high - dispersion wings of the velocity distribution of the stars in their sample .",
    "thus , the sample of @xcite , with a ` ceiling ' at @xmath2 = 1500 pc , seems to be contaminated by hot metal - weak thick disk @xcite and halo stars ; the tilt of the velocity ellipsoid which they measure might not reflect that of disk stars .",
    "the rotational lag of the stars is tied by the asymmetric drift effect to the radial velocity dispersion @xmath86 , so that @xmath109 increases with @xmath2 , precisely as observed . as explained above",
    ", a quantitative modeling of this effect is not possible on the basis of the present data alone .",
    "owing to the richness of our data , we were able to split them up into subsets based on color .",
    "as a test , we have selected only those stars with colors in the range 0.49 @xmath28 @xmath36 @xmath28 0.95 , where our sample is volume complete ( cf .",
    "[ fig0b ] ) .",
    "if we use only these stars in the de - projection of the proper motion velocities , we find the first and second moments of the velocity distribution illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figxx ] . a comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that the kinematical results inferred from the ` blue ' subset are entirely consistent with that of the total data set . only in the @xmath8 velocity component",
    "do we find , close to the midplane , an offset of 4 km / s .",
    "next we discuss the off - diagonal elements of the velocity dispersion tensor .",
    "the mixed moment @xmath110 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] as a function of height above the galactic midplane .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the implied vertex deviation @xmath111 as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the vertex deviation is non - negligible , even if it falls slightly with height above the midplane .",
    "close to the midplane our measurement is consistent with the result of @xcite . since our sample of stars",
    "is supposed to be drawn from a dynamically relaxed population of the milky way , the vertex deviation is almost certainly due to dynamical effects induced by non - axisymmetric structures in the galactic disk .",
    "the moment @xmath112 can be used to determine the apparent tilting angle of the velocity ellipsoid in the meridional plane spanned by @xmath83 and @xmath95 , @xmath113 the mixed moment itself is shown as @xmath114 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] as a function of height above the galactic midplane .",
    "the resulting tilting angle @xmath115 is depicted in the inset of fig .",
    "close to the midplane we find @xmath116 implying that the velocity ellipsoid points towards the galactic center . above the midplane the velocity ellipsoid is tilted towards the galactic center , however , by a much larger angle than previously thought ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . at a height of @xmath2 = 750 pc the velocity ellipsoid is tilted by @xmath115 = @xmath117 , whereas one would expect @xmath115 = @xmath118 if the velocity ellipsoid was pointing straight towards the galactic center . in order to assess the plausibility of this unexpected result we address each of the three input parameters of eq .",
    "[ eq13 ] in turn .",
    "we have already tested above our measurements of the vertical velocity dispersions @xmath11 using a completely different sample of m stars , for which the line - of - sight velocities in the direction towards the galactic pole are known .",
    "the radial velocity dispersions @xmath86 can be checked in a similar way .",
    "we have determined the first and second moments of the distribution of the @xmath45 and @xmath46 proper motion velocity components of those stars in our sample which lie in the cone @xmath92 . in the upper most counting volume , at 700 pc @xmath119 800 pc ,",
    "we find @xmath120 = 47.9@xmath121 0.2 km / s and @xmath122 = 36.1 @xmath5 0.2 km / s , which are in excellent agreement with the result of our de - projection formalism ( see  table 1 ) .",
    "there is no independent test of the mixed moment @xmath112 within our data at this altitude , but we note that the tilting angle of the velocity ellipsoid of @xmath123 reported by @xcite implies @xmath124 ( km / s)@xmath125 , which is even more than what we find . at mid altitudes , around 400 pc above the midplane , the sample of m stars with known radial velocities ( described above ) provides an independent check on the mixed moment @xmath112 .",
    "we have drawn from the specphoto database of _ sdss dr-7 _ a set of 201 stars with @xmath92 at heights of 400 @xmath126 @xmath2 @xmath126 600 pc above the midplane , with a mean of @xmath127 = 450 pc .",
    "since the stars lie in the cone @xmath92 , the line - of - sight velocities reflect their @xmath95 velocity components ; we obtain @xmath128 = 29.2 @xmath5 0.7 km / s . from the proper motion velocities",
    "@xmath45 we derive @xmath120 = 46.8@xmath121 1.8 km / s .",
    "we have then cross - correlated the @xmath129 and @xmath45 velocity components , giving @xmath130 = -275.5 @xmath5 46 ( km / s)@xmath125 , which implies a tilting angle of @xmath131 = 11.2 @xmath5 1.7 degrees .",
    "if the velocity ellipsoid were pointing towards the galactic center , one would expect @xmath115 = 3.2 degrees . a comparison of these independent kinematic data with the seventh and eighth row of table 1 and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows excellent agreement with the results from the statistical de - projection of the proper motion velocities .",
    "we conclude from this discussion that our measurement of the tilting angle of the velocity dispersion tensor should be quite robust .",
    "finally , we determine the epicyclic ratio , which is related to the slope of the galactic rotation curve as @xmath132 close to the midplane , we find a value of @xmath133 = -0.006 @xmath5 0.016 . which indicates a flat galactic rotation curve in the solar neighborhood .",
    "note , however , that the quoted error reflects only internal errors .",
    "equation ( [ eq15 ] ) neglects the asymmetric shape of the distribution of the @xmath70 velocity components of the stars . in order to correct for this simplification ,",
    "third moments of the velocity distribution must be known ( @xcite ) , which we have not measured here .",
    "we have analyzed the velocity distribution of stars in the galactic old thin - disk population using stellar data from the _ seventh data release of the sloan digital sky survey_. we have constructed a sample of about 2 million late - type stars in eight cylindrical counting volumes , each of which has a height of 100 pc and a diameter of 2 kpc , respectively , and which were stacked onto one another .",
    "for each star we have determined a photometric distance estimate , and combined this with their available proper motions to obtain tangential velocities .",
    "these were then treated as pseudo space velocities .",
    "we have demonstrated with monte carlo simulations that our sample provides sufficient lines of sight through the velocity distribution of the stars that the pseudo space velocities allow for a precise statistical determination of the first and second moments of the three dimensional velocity distribution .",
    "close to the galactic midplane we find @xmath134 -8.6 @xmath5 0.2 km / s and @xmath135 -7.1 @xmath5 0.2 km / s , which directly reflect the motion of the sun relative to the local standard of rest .",
    "the mean @xmath70 velocity component , @xmath136 -20.0 @xmath5 0.1 km / s , is much more negative than just the reflex of the solar motion , due to the asymmetric shape of the @xmath70 velocity distribution .",
    "close to the midplane , we obtain estimates of the velocity dispersions @xmath137 32.4 @xmath5 0.1 km / s , @xmath138 23.0 @xmath5 0.1 km / s , and @xmath139 18.1 @xmath5 0.2 km / s , respectively . with the exception of @xmath6 , all of these results are consistent with other determinations , such as analyses of the _ catalogue of nearby stars _ or _ hipparcos _",
    "stars by @xcite . however , due to the large number of stars we reach an unprecedented precision , up to ten times better than previously achieved .",
    "moreover , we have a sufficient sample to trace all quantities as a function of height above the galactic midplane .",
    "the velocity dispersions exhibit a distinct increase with height above the midplane .",
    "this is a clear indication that our sample of m stars contains a mixture of young stars with low velocity dispersions and old stars with high velocity dispersions , because only the latter ascend high above the midplane .",
    "since the rotational lag of the stars is tied by the asymmetric drift effect to the radial velocity dispersion , -@xmath8 must increase also with height above the midplane , precisely as observed .",
    "we have then studied the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid in the meridional planes spanned by the @xmath83 , @xmath70 , and @xmath95 velocity components . we find a vertex deviation of the velocity ellipsoid of about 20@xmath12 to 25@xmath12 .",
    "close to the galactic midplane the ellipsoid is oriented parallel to the galactic plane . at a height of 750 pc above the midplane",
    "the velocity ellipsoid is tilted by an angle of about @xmath140 .",
    "this is more than thought previously , because a tilting angle of @xmath141 is expected at that altitude , if the velocity ellipsoid points straight at the galactic center .    finally , we determined the epicyclic ratio which indicates , close to the midplane , a flat shape of the galactic rotation curve in the solar neighborhood .",
    "we have refrained in this paper from any detailed dynamical modelling of our data but hope to address this topic in the near future .",
