    "fluctuations in the two - species coexistence phase are remarkably and unusually strong ; they markedly alter the oscillation frequency as compared to the ( linearized ) mean - field prediction , and in addition generate damping . restricting the ( local ) prey population through a growth - limiting finite carrying capacity",

    "i have also outlined how the doi ",
    "peliti field theory representation of the associated master equation can be employed to ( i ) demonstrate that this active to absorbing state transition is governed by the universal scaling exponents of critical directed percolation , and ( ii ) permits a systematic perturbational approach to compute the fluctuation - induced renormalizations of the population spreading and oscillation parameters in the coexistence phase .",
    "it remains to be elucidated which of the standard mathematical models in ecology , population dynamics , and chemical kinetics , many of which are frequently just discussed on the level of mean - field rate equations , are similarly strongly affected by stochastic fluctuations and intrinsic correlations .",
    "perhaps unexpectedly , stochastic spatial variants of cyclic three - species predator - prey systems that are often referred to as rock - paper - scissors models represent an intriguing counter - example : lattice simulations of these reaction - diffusion systems hardly show any noticeable fluctuation effects , both for model variants with conserved and non - conserved total particle number , despite the formation of striking spiral structures in the latter , so - called may  leonard model , see refs .",
