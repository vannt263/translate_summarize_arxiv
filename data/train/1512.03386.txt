    "hypothesized the existence of exotic matter possessing negative energy in order to stabilized wormholes that can become two - way tunnels through space - time @xcite . following these authors",
    ", one may hypothesize that an `` exotic '' wormhole may be traversable and bi - directional .",
    "strictly speaking , an `` exotic '' wormhole would no longer feature horizons in the sense of classical general relativity .",
    "analogue gravity studies the similarities at the level of kinematics between the propagation of light in curved space - times and the propagation of waves in moving condensed matter media @xcite : the hawking radiation of a horizon is currently the archetypal example of astrophysical phenomenon that is studied by condensed matter groups in the laboratory . it is well known that the analogy breaks down at the level of dynamics since the dynamical equations are different : einstein s equations for space - time and say , navier - stokes equations for classical fluid analogues .",
    "nevertheless , schtzhold and unruh demonstrated that water waves propagating on a flow current can be seen as a gravitational analogue for the propagation of light in a curved space - time in the long wavelength regime corresponding to shallow gravity waves @xcite .",
    "this analogue system is currently under experimental scrutiny @xcite . in this condensed matter system ,",
    "the velocity of light is mimicked by the velocity of non - dispersive long gravity waves in water with speed @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the water depth @xcite .",
    "the horizon is the place where the velocity of the flow @xmath2 ( the flow is positive when going to the right ) is equal in modulus to the velocity of the wave @xmath3 known as the critical condition in fluid mechanics and where @xmath4 is the position along the water channel .",
    "the flow current when varying in space induces an effective curved space - time for the hydrodynamic waves propagating on top of it .",
    "for example , the schwarzschild spherical geometry is analogous to a flow with a current given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the schwarzschild radius namely a constant which depends only on the mass of the black hole and the gravitational constant .",
    "obviously , the `` flow current '' for the schwarzschild geometry goes to zero at infinity .",
    "analogue gravity is , in a sense , more general that general relativity since it encompasses as many velocity profiles as experimentalists in condensed matter can design . from the point of view of a relativist ,",
    "the analogy is not exact even if the flow goes to zero because @xmath7 does not reproduce exactly the flow profile of the schwarzschild space - time even in that case . from the point of view of analogue gravity",
    ", one can generate any flow profile and look for the common features between the experiments in condensed matter physics and the relativistic predictions which are narrower since they are derived in the particular velocity profile corresponding to the schwarzschild space - time . in water wave physics ,",
    "the flow is generated with a pump in a water channel and the variations are induced either by a changing depth or width .",
    "hence , using a bump one can generate easily sub - critical ( @xmath8 ) and super - critical ( @xmath9 ) regions . in the experiments performed so far , either the flow vanishes far from the bump @xcite or it becomes uniform @xcite . strictly speaking",
    ", the flat space - time would correspond either to a vanishing current velocity region or a constant flow region whereas a curved space - time corresponds to a region with an inhomogeneous current in space .",
    "we can possibly design `` exotic wormholes '' by looking at `` analogue wormholes '' namely pairs of horizons which are stable in analogue gravity contrary to general relativity since the dynamical equations are not the same .",
    "we will look in this work at the fate of a wave - packet propagating into an analogue wormhole in hydrodynamics . by looking first at the non - dispersive case , we will recover similar behavior to that in general relativity .",
    "indeed , a major interest of the analogue gravity program is the inclusion of dispersion which removes the infinite blue - shifting of waves close to the horizon of a black / white hole , avoiding the so - called trans - planckian problem @xcite .",
    "the hawking radiation of horizons has been shown to be robust in certain regimes even in the presence of dispersion @xcite . then , the existence of bi - directional and stable `` analogue '' wormholes in hydrodynamics will be demonstrated .",
    "their stability is due to dynamical effects ( the navier - stokes equation allows such stationary flows to exist ) , while their bi - directionality is due to dispersive effects",
    ".    a straightforward consequence will be the appearance of an analogue black hole laser effect between pairs of horizons playing the role of a laser cavity in a super - critical region .",
    "the latter effect will be implemented in water - wave physics with an anomalous dispersion relation following schtzhold and unruh @xcite who described a version with normal dispersion .",
    "the black - hole laser effect was theoretically predicted for the first time by corley and jacobson @xcite and is further discussed in @xcite .",
    "we note also its numerical demonstration in optics @xcite and its recent experimental observation in a bose - einstein condensate by steinhauer @xcite .",
    "because the dispersion is anomalous with bogoliubov phonons , self - amplification of the hawking radiation will lead to a lasing effect .",
    "the dispersion relation in the dispersion - less regime of analogue gravity is : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the angular frequency and @xmath12 is the longitudinal wavenumber ( see the figure [ relativist_rd ] ) . in water waves physics , @xmath13 is the flow current whereas @xmath14 is the water wave velocity .",
    "the reader is referred to the review chapter in @xcite on the dispersive effects met in water waves physics . in the super - critical region ( for example in the interior of a black hole in general relativity ) , negative energy waves with negative relative frequency ( @xmath15 ) are present and they are the analogue of anti - particles in quantum field theory whereas the positive relative frequency solutions ( @xmath16 ) of the dispersion relation are the analogue of particles and they only live in the sub - critical region ( namely outside of the black / white hole ) if the regime is dispersion - less .",
    "the domain of existence of analogue particles / antiparticles will change due to the presence of dispersion and will no longer be separated necessarily by the horizon as in the dispersion - less regime .",
    ", @xmath17 ) for a subcritical region where @xmath18 ( continuous straight lines ) and for a supercritical region where @xmath19 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the positive relative frequency @xmath20 corresponds to the green color ( the  corresponds to the flow current frame of reference ) ; the negative relative frequency is in blue .",
    "the conserved frequency of an incident wave as generated by a wave - maker is the horizontal line in dotted black . ]",
    "we can create a pair of horizons in a water channel either by changing twice the depth or the width of its cross section .",
    "for example , if the current flows over a bump , the current can reach first a black hole horizon in the accelerated region on the ascending slope ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) and then a white hole horizon in the decelerated region on the descending slope ( @xmath23 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "hence , in the inter - horizons region , the flow is supercritical in the long wavelength approximation whereas the flow is subcritical on both sides of the bump ( see the figure [ relativist ] left ) .",
    "inversely , if the current flows over a trough , it will generate first a white horizon and then a black horizon . in this configuration",
    "the flow is subcritical between both horizons whereas it is supercritical outside ( see the figure [ relativist ] right ) . for both the bump and the trough geometries and depending on the shape of the bump ( for example , by including a flat plate on the top of it )",
    ", we can reach a constant flow region of a finite extent where the flow is supercritical and where dispersion - less waves can only propagate in a co - current direction so are compelled to be expelled from this supercritical black / white hole region .",
    "contrary to general relativity , a wormhole in hydrodynamics would be stable and stationary provided the flow current is constant in time .",
    "as in general relativity , an analogue wormhole in hydrodynamics would be unidirectional if the medium is dispersion - less since an incoming wave - packet willing to enter into the analogue wormhole and generated in the sub - critical region outside the black hole ( namely in the flat space - time region ) can only propagate in the co - current direction by entering first into the black hole through the black horizon , then it would proceed in the supercritical region following the current , before escaping the white hole through the white horizon where he would reach a new flat space - time region ( @xmath24 in the figure [ relativist ] left top in continuous line ) . this case will be denoted as - black@xmath25white - in the rest of the paper where continuous lines refer to wave packets and their mode - converted partners generated in co - current whereas dashed lines refer to the ones generated in counter - current . in the dispersion - less regime , the only direction of propagation which is permitted is - black@xmath25white - ( co - current ) : the incident wave entering into the analogue black hole is just refracted at the black horizon and at the white one by the velocity gradient .",
    "a larger velocity gradient ( @xmath26 ) would be able to convert a part of the incident wave into a negative mode in the supercritical region and a positive counter current mode in the sub - critical region near to the black hole .",
    "but this negative mode would suffer an infinite blue - shifting when arriving on the white horizon ( see the continuous lines in the figure [ relativist ] left top ) .",
    "hence , due to the flow gradient ( analogue to the tidal forces at the horizon ) , mode conversion happens ( in continuous lines ) : @xmath24 is converted partly into positive energy waves @xmath27 and negative energy waves @xmath28 ( see the figure [ relativist ] left top in continuous line ) .",
    "conversely , the reverse travel of a wave - packet ( starting in the subcritical region on the right of the bump in the figure [ relativist ] left that is outside the white hole region ) through the very same wormhole in the direction - white@xmath25black - namely against the counter - current , would be impossible due to the infinite blue - shifting at the white hole horizon ( @xmath27 in the figure [ relativist ] left top in dashed line ) .",
    "this behavior is similar to the trans - planckian problem in general relativity ( @xmath27 in the figure [ relativist ] left top in dashed line ) since the wavelength goes to zero at the horizon because @xmath29 .",
    "a similar phenomenon appears in the case of a wave - packet sent in the inter - horizon region in a trough velocity field ( see the figure [ relativist ] right bottom ) .",
    "the incident wave - packet @xmath27 going against the current is infinitely blue - shifted at the white horizon ( see the figure [ relativist ] right top in dashed line ) .",
    "the incident mode @xmath24 in co - current goes through the black horizon , converts to a negative mode @xmath28 in the super - critical region and a positive counter - current mode in the sub - critical region @xmath27 which is also characterized by a continuous line because it comes from the conversion of the wave - packet @xmath24 . to resume",
    ", we separate the two cases ( continuous and dashed ) by the direction in which the wave packet is sent initially . in all the cases and without dispersion",

    "when the wavelength gets shorter , the effect of surface tension becomes relevant @xcite .",

    "studied the effect of the capillary length on the blocking of water waves and they showed how it can play the role of a cut - off on analogue hawking radiation @xcite . following the experimental observation of badulin et al . @xcite and the calculations of trulsen and mei @xcite",
    ", they provide a parameter space diagram where the blocking velocity of waves at horizons is a function of their incoming period for a white hole configuration ( an incoming wave starting outside of the white hole horizon in the sub - critical region propagates in the direction opposite to the counter - current and it may be blocked and mode - converted ) .",
    "rousseaux et al .",
    "characterized the different mode conversions featuring six wave - numbers and three horizons ( white , blue and negative ) described by the dispersion relation of water waves @xcite ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 for water ) : @xmath33 the latter may be derived from the generalized unruh equation including both the dispersive effects of the water depth and surface tension @xcite : @xmath34 its long wavelength limit describes the propagation of light in curved space - time provided the velocity of light corresponds to the velocity of long gravity waves @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "if we introduce the two dispersive lengths into the dispersion relation ( the water depth @xmath1 and the capillary length @xmath36 in water ) , we get : @xmath37 if we approximate the dispersion relation by a taylor series up to the third order and assuming @xmath38 , we obtain : @xmath39 hence , the water depth induces a dispersive correction in @xmath40 whereas the capillary length induces a correction in @xmath41 both for shallow depths @xcite .",
