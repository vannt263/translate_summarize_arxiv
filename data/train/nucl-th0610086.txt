    "interactions between the octet baryons ( @xmath20 and @xmath17 ) and the @xmath5 cluster are important ingredients to consider the possible existence for various kinds of light hypernuclei through detailed microscopic cluster - model calculations .",
    "if reliable effective @xmath21 interactions were known , one could easily calculate the @xmath22 potentials , using the standard cluster - model techniques .",
    "unfortunately , this is not the case except for @xmath23 , since the bare @xmath21 interaction itself is not well known especially for the @xmath16 and @xmath17 hyperons , because of the technical difficulties of strangeness experiments .",
    "even if these bare interactions were eventually known , we further need to develop the procedure to link the bare interactions and effective interactions through some effective interaction theory such as the @xmath3-matrix formalism .",
    "we have recently developed the qcd - inspired spin - flavor @xmath4 quark model for the baryon - baryon interaction @xcite , which is a unified model for the full octet - baryons @xcite , and have achieved accurate descriptions of the @xmath24 and @xmath19 interactions @xcite . in particular , the @xmath24 interaction of the most recent model fss2 is accurate enough to compare with modern realistic meson - exchange models .",
    "these quark - model interactions were used for the detailed study of few - baryon systems such as @xmath25 @xcite and @xmath26 @xcite , and also of some typical @xmath8-hypernuclei , @xmath27 @xcite and @xmath28 @xcite , through a newly developed three - cluster faddeev formalism @xcite and @xmath3-matrix calculations @xcite .",
    "we can now use these baryon - baryon interactions to calculate not only the @xmath0 interaction , but also @xmath1 and @xmath2 interactions , assuming the harmonic - oscillator ( h.o . ) shell - model wave function for the @xmath5-cluster .",
    "there are , in fact , a couple of advanced procedure to derive the interactions between a single baryon and finite nuclei based on the density - dependent hartree - fock theory of @xmath3-matrix interactions @xcite .",
    "these approaches , however , use the localized @xmath3-matrix interaction in the configuration space and the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) coordinate system connected to the target nucleus . for the @xmath22 interactions , the c.m .",
    "correction is quite important . in this paper",
    ", we will derive @xmath22 born kernels , directly starting from the @xmath3-matrix calculation of the quark - model baryon - baryon interactions .",
    "we deal with the nonlocality of the @xmath3-matrix and the c.m .",
    "motion exactly , using the cluster - model approach , at the expense of the self - consistency between the @xmath5-cluster formation and the @xmath3-matrix interaction .",
    "the @xmath3-matrix is pre - determined by solving the bethe - goldstone equation in symmetric nuclear matter , and the momentum - dependent single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "potentials as well @xcite .",
    "the fermi - momentum is assumed to be the standard value @xmath29 , but the obtained @xmath22 interactions depend on this choice rather monotonously , except for some special cases such as the @xmath0 @xmath30 interaction .",
    "the treatment of the starting - energy dependence and the non - galilean invariant momentum dependence of the @xmath3-matrix is explicitly discussed .",
    "we believe that these approximations are good enough to understand the unknown @xmath1 and @xmath2 interactions qualitatively , starting from the quark - model predictions of various baryon - baryon interactions . for the @xmath0 interaction ,",
    "we compare the predictions by the present approach with some available phenomenological @xmath0 potentials @xcite , obtained by various methods .",
    "another application of the present approach to the @xmath31 interaction will be published in a separate paper , since this system involves an extra nucleon - exchange term .",
    "since the obtained @xmath22 interactions are all nonlocal , we calculate the wigner transform from the @xmath22 born kernels .",
    "we find that the momentum dependence of the wigner transform is very strong , and the procedure to find effective local potential by solving the transcendental equation is necessary to obtain a local - potential image for the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 interactions are repulsive , although the isospin @xmath12 ( for @xmath1 ) and @xmath13 ( for @xmath2 ) contributions of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 interactions are attractive . as the first step to study realistic @xmath1 and @xmath2 interactions",
    ", we will only discuss the zero - momentum wigner transform in this paper .",
    "although these @xmath22 interactions are complex due to the imaginary part of the underlying @xmath3-matrices , we discuss only the real part .",
    "the spin - orbit @xmath22 potentials are naturally obtained from the @xmath30 and @xmath32 components of the @xmath3-matrix invariant interaction .",
    "the central @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 potentials were calculated by many authors with other ( usually more crude or purely phenomenological ) approaches .",
    "the @xmath33 potential was calculated numerously , and different shapes were considered .",
    "for instance , see refs.@xcite .",
    "some phenomenological @xmath1 and @xmath2 potentials are found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the comparison of our results with these potentials are , however , not easy , since our wigner transform is momentum - dependent and the solutions of the transcendental equations are strongly energy - dependent",
    ". we will only point out if some resemblance between them are found .",
    "the importance of the isospin dependence of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 interactions to the @xmath16-nucleus and @xmath17-nucleus potentials has been discussed by many authors from the phenomenological aspects , for example , in refs.@xcite , and by rijken and yamamoto from the viewpoint of @xmath3-matrix calculations in ref.@xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next formulation section ,",
    "we first give in section 2.1 the basic folding formula for the @xmath5-cluster based on the separation of the @xmath22 born kernel to the spin - isospin factors and the spatial part .",
    "the treatment of @xmath3-matrix variables , the starting energy and the c.m .",
    "momentum , will be carefully discussed .",
    "a convenient transformation formula for the rearrangement of relative momenta is given in section 2.2 , by which the partial wave component of the @xmath22 born kernel is explicitly given both for the central component and the @xmath30 component .",
    "the folding formula in the partial - wave expansion and the partial - wave components of the @xmath22 born kernel are explicitly given in section 2.3 .",
    "a procedure to calculate the wigner transform is given in section 2.4 with a couple of approximations .",
    "one of the approximations for the @xmath30 component yields a simple factor for the strength of the @xmath30 potential , which corresponds to the well - known scheerbaum factor @xmath36 @xcite in nuclear matter .",

    "<S> an equivalent local potential derived from the wigner transform of the nonlocal @xmath0 kernel shows a strong energy dependence for the incident @xmath8-particle , indicating the importance of the strangeness - exchange process in the original hyperon - nucleon interaction . for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 potentials , </S>",
