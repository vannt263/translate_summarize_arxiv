    "the binary hd49798/rxj0648.04418  has been proposed by the organizers of this conference as one of the `` _ _ mystery object of the day _ _ '' .",
    "indeed , the peculiar properties of the bright star attracted the attention of many astronomers since the time of its first observations in the sixties .",
    "the discovery of pulsed soft x - rays with _ rosat _ in 1996 renewed interest in this binary , while our more recent results showed its relevance for the topics discussed in this iau symposium .    here ,",
    "after briefly reviewing how the main mystery , i.e. the nature of the unseen companion of , was finally solved thanks to x - ray observations , we discuss a few other puzzling issues still to be clarified to fully understand this unique binary system .",
    "the first spectroscopic observations of this bright blue star ( b=8 , b@xmath4v=@xmath40.27 ) showed a dominance of he and n lines and radial velocity variations , pointing to a binary nature .",
    "@xcite included   in the ( then small ) group of early type subdwarfs and , pointing out the peculiarities of its spectrum , concluded their paper with the sentence `` _ _ the orbit of this object would obviously be very desirable _ _ '' .",
    "a few years later the orbital period ( 1.5477 days ) and mass function were derived by @xcite , who also pointed out the lack of eclipse and/or ellipsoidal variations in the optical light curve . on the basis of these findings he suggested that the companion of  could be a white dwarf , but the possibility of a late type main sequence star , outshined in the optical / uv spectra by the much brighter emission from the hot and luminous subdwarf ( l@xmath210@xmath5 @xmath6 ) , could not be excluded . in the following years several studies concentrated on a detailed modeling of the star s atmosphere ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "was classified as a subdwarf of spectral type o6 , with an effective temperature t@xmath7 = 47500@xmath02000 k , and a surface gravity log__g _ _",
    "= 4.25@xmath00.2 @xcite .",
    "the overabundance of helium , equalling h in number , was confirmed ( mass fractions of x@xmath8=0.29 and x@xmath9=0.78 ) .",
    "the low h abundance suggests that  is the stripped core of an initially much more massive and larger star .",
    "also the high abundance of n and low abundance of c and o confirm that its present surface layers once belonged to the outer part of the hydrogen - burning core of a massive star , consistent with an evolution involving a common envelope phase .",
    "the optical mass function could be measured with great precision by @xcite ( f@xmath10=0.263@xmath00.004 @xmath3 ) , but all the attempts to reveal the invisible companion of this single - lined spectroscopic binary were unsuccessful .",
    "the mystery was partially solved in 1996 , thanks to the _ rosat _ discovery of periodic pulsations at 13 s in the soft x - ray ( 0.1 - 2 kev ) flux @xcite . this clearly pointed to the presence of a collapsed object , but it was impossible to distinguish between a neutron star or a white dwarf .",
    "the very soft spectrum was well fit with a blackbody plus power - law model , but with a poorly constrained luminosity in the range from @xmath210@xmath11 erg s@xmath12 up to more than 10@xmath13 erg s@xmath12 ( for the well known distance of 650 pc ) , compatible with both possibilities .",
    "the x - ray emission from  is too soft and faint for satellites like _ bepposax _ , _ asca _ or _ rossixte _ , so we had to wait for  in order to make further progress .",
    "after four short observations done in 2002 which added little information @xcite , we managed to obtain a long pointing of  in may 2008 , strategically scheduled at the time of conjunction .",
    "our main objectives were to exploit the regular x - ray periodicity , which makes this system equivalent to a double spectroscopic binary , to constrain the masses of the two stars , and to get a better estimate of the source spectral parameters and luminosity .",
    "the measurement of the x - ray pulse delays induced by the orbital motion , and the discovery of an x - ray eclipse lasting @xmath21.3 hours , allowed us to derive the x - ray mass function as well as the system s inclination ( 79@xmath14 ) .",
    "this information , coupled to the already known optical mass function , gives the masses of the two stars : m@xmath15 = 1.50@xmath00.05 @xmath3 for the subdwarf  and m@xmath16 = 1.28@xmath00.05 @xmath3 for its companion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the high quality spectrum obtained with the epic instrument showed that the total luminosity is only @xmath210@xmath11 erg s@xmath12 , much smaller than that expected from a neutron star accreting in the stellar wind of .",
    "while the mysterious companion of  has finally been unveiled by x - ray observations , this binary certainly deserves further study .",
    "it stands out in the zoo of accreting x - ray binaries for being the only one composed of a white dwarf and a subdwarf .",
    "furthermore , the white dwarf , besides being one of the most massive white dwarfs with a dynamical mass measurement , is the one with the shortest spin period ( p=13 s ) .",
    "these properties make hd49798/rxj0648.04418  particularly attractive in the context of type ia sne progenitors .",
    "the radius of  ( 1.45@xmath00.25 @xmath17 ) is much smaller than that of its roche - lobe . on the other hand",
    "this is one of the few o - type subdwarfs with evidence for a relatively strong stellar wind , with a mass loss of @xmath23@xmath1810@xmath19 @xmath3 yr@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "thus the white dwarf is accreting through capture of the subdwarf s wind , and there is no evidence for an accretion disk .",
    "if significant spin - up occurred , this must have been either during the common envelope phase , which seems unlikely owing to its short duration and complicated dynamics of the envelope mass , or before it , possibly when the expanding  was close to fill its roche - lobe .",
    "note that it is relatively easy to spin - up a weakly magnetized white dwarf , due to the high specific angular momentum carried by the accreting mass if the accretion disk extends down to the star s",
    "surface @xcite .",
    "if the value of p=13.2 s observed now has remained close to the equilibrium period , we can relate the accretion rate during the spin - up phase , @xmath20 , to the strength of the magnetic field : @xmath21 @xmath3 yr@xmath12 , where @xmath22 is the magnetic dipole moment in units of 10@xmath23 g @xmath24 .",
    "if indeed the magnetic field of  is as small as discussed below , one wonders why the white dwarf is not rotating even faster than observed . in any case , independent of its origin , the high rotational velocity might have important consequences for the future evolution of this white dwarf .",
    "the x - ray emission of  consists of a soft blackbody component , with kt=40 ev and a strong nearly sinusoidal modulation ( pulsed fraction 56% ) , plus a harder component dominating above @xmath21 kev .",
    "the latter can be fit equally well by a power law with photon index @xmath25=1.6 or by a thermal bremsstrahlung with kt=8 kev , and shows a double peaked pulse profile @xcite .",
    "such characteristics are quite similar to those of cataclysmic variables of the polar and intermediate polar class , despite these systems are very different for what concerns their mass donor stars .",
    "these similarities suggest that that the x - ray emission properties depend mainly on the physical conditions near the white dwarf , with little influence of the large scale accretion scenario ( wind accretion in  _ wrt _ roche lobe overflow in cataclysmic variables ) .",
    "a condition for accretion onto the white dwarf surface is that the magnetospheric radius , defined by balancing the magnetic pressure and the ram pressure of the accreting matter , be smaller than the corotation radius r@xmath26 = ( g m@xmath16 p@xmath27/4@xmath28)@xmath29 .",
    "this allows us to estimate an upper limit of 2@xmath30 g @xmath24 on the magnetic moment of .",
    "an even stronger limit of @xmath31@xmath32 g @xmath24 is obtained assuming that accretion takes place in the sub - sonic propeller regime , in which r@xmath33@xmath34r@xmath26 , but the matter is too hot to accrete @xcite .",
    "these limits correspond to fields of the order of only a few kg at the white dwarf s surface , much smaller than those of cataclysmic variables . with such a small field",
    "it is probably difficult to channel the accreting plasma . on the other hand the large pulsed fraction ( @xmath260% ) observed below 1",
    "kev requires some form of non - isotropic emission .",
    "one possibility is that the field has a non - dipolar geometry , given that the above limits refer only to the dipolar component .      at the end of the current he - burning phase ,",
    "will expand again and transfer he - rich matter through roche - lobe overflow during a semi - detached phase @xcite , but the fraction of mass that is retained on the white dwarf is rather uncertain .",
    "recent computations , performed assuming the mass accumulation efficiency that takes into account the wind mass loss triggered by the he - shell flashes @xcite , indicate that a mass of 1.4 @xmath3 can be reached after only a few 10@xmath5 years @xcite . however , there are other critical factors which influence the final fate of the white dwarf , such as , e.g. , its composition and rotational velocity",
    ".    if  is a co white dwarf , it could be the progenitor of an over - luminous type ia supernova , since the fast rotation can increase the mass stability limit above the value for non - rotating stars .",
    "massive white dwarfs are expected to have an one composition , but again the high spin might play a role here , since it can lead to the formation of co white dwarfs even for high masses @xcite . being the result of the evolution of relatively massive stars ( @xmath289 @xmath3 ) , hd49798/rxj0648.04418  would seem a type ia supernova progenitor with a short delay time",
    ". however , the delay time might be considerably longer if the explosion has to await that the white dwarf spins down @xcite .    alternatively , if  is an one white dwarf , an accretion induced collapse might occur leading to the formation of a neutron star .",
    "the high spin rate and low magnetic field make this white dwarf an ideal progenitor of a millisecond pulsar .",
    "the evolution of systems like hd49798/rxj0648.04418  could be a promising scenario for the direct formation of millisecond pulsars , i.e. one not involving the recycling of old pulsars in accreting low mass x - ray binaries ."
