    "the most known phenomenological model , accounting for many of the properties of he ii , given by _ tisza _ @xcite and _ landau _ @xcite is called the two - fluid model .",
    "the basic assumption is that the liquid behaves as a mixture of two fluids : the normal component with density @xmath0 and velocity @xmath1 , and the superfluid component with density @xmath2 and velocity @xmath3 . when the difference @xmath4 between the normal and superfluid velocities , known also as counterflow velocity , exceed a certain critical velocity , a _ mutual friction _",
    "@xmath5 has to be included .",
    "this friction force is attributed to an interaction of the normal component with the vortices in the superfluid .",
    "quantized superfluid vortices play an important role in the hydrodynamics of the fluid and they have been the object of many studies . the state of the fluid in which vortices are present , is referred to as the _ superfluid turbulent state_. a review on superfluid turbulence can be found in tough s paper @xcite and in chapter 7 of donnelly s book @xcite .",
    "the quantized vortices created by applying a thermal counterflow form an irregular , spatially disordered tangle of lines . in this case , the vortex line density @xmath6 ( length of vortex line per unit volume ) is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the modulus of the relative velocity between the two components of the mixture and @xmath9 a temperature - dependent coefficient @xcite .",
    "the vortex system is almost isotropic , provided that one neglects a small anisotropy induced by the imposed counterflow @xcite .",
    "the creation of the vortices can not be made only in this way ; in fact , the first studies of quantized vorticity involved a sample of he ii rotating at constant angular velocity @xmath10 exceeding a certain small critical value .",
    "the results brought to an ordered array of vortices aligned along the rotation axis , whose number density per unit area is given by feynman s rule @xmath11 , where @xmath12 @xmath13sec is the quantum of circulation , with @xmath14 planck s constant and @xmath15 mass of the helium atom .",
    "now , an important question naturally arises : what happens if vortices are created by both rotation and counterflow ? there has been only one experiment of which we are aware @xcite , on the formation of vortices in combined rotation and counterflow along the rotational axis .",
    "this experiment suggests that there exists a form of steady rotating turbulence , characterized by a vortex line density at given counterflow velocity @xmath8 and angular velocity @xmath16 .",
    "swanson et al .",
    "@xcite found that at slow rotation the critical counterflow velocity above which the flow became turbulent was greatly reduced .",
    "the experimental observations showed that the two effects ( thermal counterflow and rotation ) are not merely additive , in fact for @xmath17 high the measured values of @xmath6 are always less than @xmath18 .",
    "however , from our point of view the results of these experiments are purely qualitative because the authors did nt take the anisotropy of the vortex tangle in consideration which , as we will see in the last section of this paper , is essential to know the spatial distribution of the vortex tangle in liquid helium ii through measurements of second sound attenuation .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the propagation of longitudinal density and temperature waves , and longitudinal and transversal velocity waves and heat waves in the combined situation of a rotating frame and of a cylindrical container in presence of thermal counterflow .",
    "the studies of the two separate cases of pure rotation and pure thermal counterflow are also considered in order to give a more complete view of the wave propagation in these three different situations .",
    "the influence of the parameters characterizing the vorticity on the propagation of the waves is shown explicitly .",
    "the practical interest of this research is to obtain information on the vortex tangle from measurements on wave propagation .",
    "this is an important issue , because under the combined influence of rotation and counterflow the vortex tangle can not be assumed isotropic .",
    "then , we must find not only the vortex line density @xmath6 but also the geometrical characterization , which requires , in principle , to consider wave propagation in different directions , as well as a deeper full analysis of waves . note that here the tangle itself is not considered as a dynamical quantity , because it is not modified by the second sound .",
    "for this reason , evolution equations for the tangle are not needed here .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following : section 2 is concerned with the model for helium ii , in which the use of a pressure tensor associated to the vorticity has been considered ; in section 3 and in section 4 we study wave propagation in rotating frame and in presence of thermal counterflow respectively , pure rotation is analyzed in the general case in which a component of the mutual friction force parallel to the rotation axis is present ; finally , in section 5 we study wave propagation in simultaneous rotation and counterflow , analyzing two different situations about the relative direction of wave propagation with respect to the rotation vector .",
    "many observations have shown that both thermal conductivity @xmath19 and the relaxation time of the heat flux @xmath20 in helium ii are very high .",
    "as observed in @xcite their ratio @xmath21 determines the velocity of the second sound , which is a heat wave propagating in the superfluid . as a consequence ,",
    "it is natural to use a thermodynamical theory where the heat flux @xmath22 appears as a further fundamental field . in this way ,",
    "a linear macroscopic one - fluid model of liquid helium ii , based on extended thermodynamics @xcite , has been formulated @xcite .",
    "this model is able to describe the laminar flow of the superfluid both in the presence and in absence of dissipative phenomena and to predict the propagation of the two sounds in bulk liquid helium ii and of the fourth sound in liquid helium flowing in a porous medium @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , in agreement with microscopic and experimental data .    in order to describe the presence of vortices in rotating helium ii , in superfluid turbulence or in combined rotation and thermal counterflow",
    ", the use of a further additional pressure tensor @xmath23 , associated to the vorticity , is necessary . the simplified situations of a rotating frame and of pure thermal counterflow have been considered in @xcite , where a constitutive relation for @xmath24 and its influence on the dynamics of the heat flux has been studied .    in this work",
    "the more complex situation involving thermal counterflow in a rotating cylinder , which is receiving much attention recently @xcite-@xcite , is considered too .",
    "we start from a linear macroscopic one - fluid model of liquid helium ii , whose fundamental fields are the density @xmath25 , the barycentric velocity @xmath26 , which is related to the two velocities of the two - fluid model by the relation @xmath27 , the temperature @xmath28 and the heat flux @xmath29 , related to the counterflow velocity @xmath8 by the relation @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 is the entropy of the helium ii ) . in the two - fluid model the natural variables are @xmath3 and @xmath32 , but in the experiments it is @xmath26 and @xmath29 which are directly measured .",
    "therefore , the use of @xmath26 and @xmath29 appears suitable for our analysis . neglecting the bulk and shear viscosity and under the hypothesis of small thermal dilatation ( which in helium ii are indeed very small ) , the linearized system of field equations for liquid helium ii , in a non inertial frame , in absence of external force , is @xcite : @xmath33 in this system , @xmath34 is the inertial force",
    ", @xmath35 is a positive coefficient linked to the second sound velocity , and : @xmath36 are the thermostatic pressure and the specific heat respectively ( @xmath37 is the specific internal energy ) .",
    "the effect of vortices is described by incorporating the source term @xmath38 to the evolution equation of the heat flux .",
    "as we will see , the expression of @xmath24 will assume different expressions in the different situations considered .",
    "now , a small comparison between the one - fluid model and the two - fluid model could be useful . with",
    "the corresponding transformations between the natural variables in the one fluid model , @xmath26 and @xmath29 , and those in the two - fluid model , @xmath3 and @xmath32 , the evolution equations ( [ 1 ] ) of the one - fluid model are equivalent to those of the two - fluid model in the linear approximation @xcite .",
    "a formal difference is found in the form of the production term in the evolution equation for the heat flux ( [ 1]d ) . when specified to pure rotation , this production term , as given by ( [ sigma2 ] ) ,",
    "has the usual hall - vinen form , whereas when specified to counterflow , the production term , as given by ( [ 4.1 ] ) , yields the well - known gorter - mellinck form .",
    "these two situations have been well explored in the context of the two - fluid and one - fluid frameworks . in the combined situation with simultaneous rotation and counterflow , the general form of the production term in ( [ 1]d )",
    "is especially useful , as expressed in ( [ pesp2 ] ) and ( [ 5.38 ] ) , because it allows one to write in an explicit and appealing way the anisotropy of the tangle , whose influence on the second sound is one of our main concerns .",
    "given the same geometrical conditions for the tangle  which here are given a priori , and whose form is probed by means of second sound  , the evolution equations of the two - fluid model would coincide with those of the one - fluid model .",
    "thus , the dispersion relations obtained here should be valid also in the context of the two - fluid model .",
    "the one - fluid and the two - fluid models are not identical to each other . however , their mutual differences arise in contexts which are not relevant in the analysis presented here .",
    "for instance , one difference arises in the fourth sound in helium through porous media , in which some experimental results seem to support the one - fluid model @xcite .",
    "anyway , the two - fluid model could also cope with that situation provided the assumption that the superfluid component carries no entropy is slightly relaxed by assuming that it may carry a small but nonvanishing entropy .",
    "other differences arise concerning the interaction between second sound and the vortex tangle . here",
    ", we have assumed that second sound does not modify the vortex line density nor the geometrical structure of the tangle .",
    "if it is assumed that it may modify the vortex tangle , more general evolution equations would be needed , as for instance an evolution equation for the vortex line density @xmath6 coupled with the rotation and counterflow , which have already been explored in the literature @xcite . for instance , the evolution equation for @xmath6 could be different  a generalized form of vinen s equation with the mentioned couplings has been proposed and studied @xcite  but this is not relevant here because an equation for @xmath6 is not necessary in this paper , as @xmath6 is taken as fixed , and its value must be found from wave experiments .",
    "some other differences may appear , concerning , for instance , the possibility of vortex density waves at high frequencies in the one - fluid model @xcite that do not arise in the hall - vinen - bekarevich - khalatnikov model @xcite . since in this work we are focusing our attention to a situation in which the interaction between the second sound and the tangle does not distort the vortex lines nor the vortex density , the dispersion relations obtained in this paper by using the production terms @xmath39 would be also valid in the two - fluid context by using a production term of the form @xmath40 in an evolution equation for the relative velocity @xmath41 .",
    "we generalize here the results of @xcite to the case in which a small interaction between second sound and vortex line parallel to the rotation axis is present . in @xcite , hall and",
    "vinen described experiments of liquid helium ii in a rotating frame , showing the main effects on the propagation and attenuation of the second sound as a consequence of the interaction between quasi - particles and vortex lines : these interactions are mainly present in the planes orthogonal to the rotation axis .",
    "as consequence of these experiments , in @xcite , jou , lebon and mongiov proposed an expression for the production term @xmath42 in ( [ 1]d ) , which takes into account dissipative and non dissipative contributions of the interaction between quasi - particles and vortex lines , but they did not consider interactions parallel to the rotation axis .    in another experiment @xcite , snyder studied the component of mutual friction along the rotational axis , and his result , in agreement with @xcite , shows that this friction component is very small compared with the orthogonal components but not exactly zero . in this section",
    ", we consider the most general case in which the axial component is included . in order to do that , the following vorticity tensor @xmath43 is used @xcite : [ pomega ] * p*_^r = l_r , where @xmath44 is the unit matrix , @xmath45 the ricci tensor , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the hall - vinen coefficients @xcite describing the orthogonal dissipative and non dissipative contributions while @xmath48 is the friction coefficient along the rotational axis . using the eq .",

    "we will assume that the propagating waves do not affect the vortex tangle , i.e. that they do not contribute to the production nor the destruction of vortices .",
    "in other terms , the waves are used to explore a given vortex tangle , without modifying it .",
    "if the wave amplitude is high enough , it could yield new contributions to the tangle .    in the following we assume that @xmath10 is small , so that the term @xmath60 in ( [ 1]b ) can be neglected .",

    "the study of the longitudinal modes furnishes the existence of two waves : the first is known as _ first sound _ or _ pressure wave _ in which density and velocity vibrate , and the second is known as _ second sound _ or _ temperature wave _ in which temperature and heat flux vibrate .",

    "in this section , we study wave propagation in presence of pure thermal counterflow in liquid helium ii to compare the results with those of @xcite and those of section 5 .",

    "in this work we have studied the propagation of waves ( longitudinal density and temperature waves , longitudinal and transversal velocity and heat waves ) in turbulent superfluid helium in the three situations : rotating frame , thermal counterflow , and simultaneous thermal counterflow and rotation . + from the physical point of view it is interesting to note that our detailed analysis in section 5 shows that , in contrast to which one could intuitively expect , measurements in a single direction are enough to give information on all the variables describing the vortex tangle , namely @xmath6 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , for instance , from one of ( [ 5.45])-([5.46 ] ) and ( [ 5.52 ] ) or of ( [ 5.22])-([5.26 ] ) and ( [ 5.25 ] ) .",
    "this is not an immediate intuitive result .",
    "future analyses of work along this direction could be , for instance , to consider that @xmath16 and @xmath8 have arbitrary directions , i.e. that they are not parallel to each other , in which case ( [ 5.38 ] ) would not be sufficient to describe the vortex tangle , because no isotropy in the @xmath112 plane could be assumed .",
    "another topic could be to assume that the external waves produce vibrations in the vortex lines , without creating nor destroying them .",
    "an example of that is the work of barenghi et al .",
    "@xcite . a more general possibility would be to consider that nonlinear effects of the external waves create and destroy new vortices . yet",
    "another topic would be to consider what happens with waves whose wavevector @xmath151 become short enough to be comparable with the average vortex separation , of the order @xmath152 . in this case , one could study nonlocal effects in the vortex @xcite .",
    "the first mentioned application could be carried out within the existing physical model , at the expenses of more cumbersome calculations .",
    "in contrast , the other three applications need more progress in the basic physical understanding of the problem .",
