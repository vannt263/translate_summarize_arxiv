    "the construction of a relativistic model of gravity contains the following ingredients : ( i ) a 4-dimensional manifold @xmath1 endowed with a lorentzian metric , ( ii ) a matter source description , ( iii ) dynamical laws ",
    "einstein s field equations and , if needed , matter equations .",
    "a general relativistic _",
    "cosmological _ model requires that one in addition attempts to describe the universe at a particular scale .    at the largest spatial scales",
    "present observational data suggest that the ` standard ' @xmath2 model of cosmology provides the most simple consistent description of the universe today .",
    "this model is spatially homogeneous ( sh ) and isotropic with flat spatial geometry ; the matter content consists of a dark energy component , modeled by a positive cosmological constant , supplemented with dark matter and atoms , described by pressureless fluids with @xmath3 , the unit normal to the symmetry surfaces , as the common 4-velocity .",
    "density fluctuations , described by linear scalar perturbations , are seeded by an almost gaussian , adiabatic , nearly scale invariant process , see e.g.  @xcite,@xcite , and references therein .",
    "however , this description does not hold on all scales , neither spatial nor temporal . on",
    "smaller spatial scales matter has to be described by many components , with energy fluxes in different directions , e.g. , our galaxy is moving w.r.t .",
    "to the cmb . in the very early universe , and",
    "perhaps also in the distant future , the @xmath2 model does not give a correct matter description , indeed , although radiation can be treated as a gravitational test field today it has been an important gravitational source in the past , and inflationary proponents suggest that matter could be extremely different in the very early universe .",
    "clearly the matter description in the ` standard ' scenario is not exact , and even with a few matter components the associated energy fluxes can not all be _ exactly _ aligned , not even on the largest spatial scales .",
    "what then happens with the matter and its associated energy fluxes in the far future and what was the situation in the distant past ?",
    "we believe that we understand how radiation and matter interacts , at least after the very early universe when we think our empirical experience holds .",
    "presumably this interaction explains why the 4-velocities associated with radiation and matter today are fairly well aligned with each other on large spatial scales , or maybe this alignment was produced in the very early universe by some unknown process , perhaps inflation .",
    "but is it obvious that this alignment should have persisted to the extent present observations indicate after recombination , and is it going to persist in the far future ?",
    "do linear vector perturbations of sh and isotropic models suffice to determine this ? in",
    "the early universe interactions presumably played an important role in aligning energy fluxes of different matter components , but it is unclear what those interactions were ; is it possible to shed any light on this issue without knowing the details of these interactions ?    here",
    "we are going to consider two non - interacting perfect fluids that in general move w.r.t .",
    "each other and a non - negative cosmological constant , which includes the @xmath2 matter content as a special case .",
    "although this may not be a good matter description at all times , it is still a useful step since it allows a comparative study of the effects of various types of interactions in possible future projects , an issue we return to in the concluding remarks .",
    "two matter source components with energy fluxes in different directions produce an anisotropic source which excludes the isotropic standard model and forces one to consider anisotropic geometries .",
    "there are several reasons that suggest that the natural anisotropic models to start with are the sh bianchi type i models .",
    "one reason is their geometric simplicity since this sheds light on more general models ",
    "if type i turns out to be complicated , then more general models will be even worse .",
    "but more importantly is that they are the foundation in a hierarchy of ever more geometrically complex models .",
    "the sh bianchi models ( models that admit simply transitive 3-dimensional symmetry groups ) form a crucial level in the geometric complexity hierarchy , and within this level the bianchi type i models is the common ingredient since they can be obtained from all other bianchi models by lie algebra contractions .",
    "the consequences of this property are revealed when one casts einstein s equations into a dynamical system where the type i models appear as part of a state space boundary that describes asymptotic features of all other bianchi models , see e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite , and references therein .",
    "moreover , the bianchi models themselves serve as building blocks for understanding asymptotic dynamics of more general inhomogeneous models , the primary reason being the following : in the very early universe near a generic or isotropic singularity , or in the very late universe in an inflationary epoch , horizons form and asymptotically shrink , asymptotically prohibiting communication  a phenomenon naturally referred to as asymptotic silence  generically pushing inhomogeneities outside the horizons leading to that the asymptotic evolution can locally be described by sh models  asymptotic locality , see  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . in the dynamical systems",
    "approach these features are formally captured by recasting the field equations into an infinite dimensional dynamical system that at each spatial point has a boundary  the silent boundary , which asymptotically attracts generic asymptotically local dynamics .",
    "the dynamics on the silent boundary , which determine the generic asymptotically local dynamics , is described by a finite dimensional dynamical system that is identical to that of the bianchi models and hence type i is a common key ingredient in a very general context  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "furthermore , there are hints , analytical and numerical , that bianchi models are important for describing future asymptotic states , even in the absence of inflation and asymptotic silence and locality , that sheds light on spatial structure formation .",
    "this is not the first study using dynamical systems techniques for studying multi - fluid models .",
    "bianchi models with two fluids with both 4-velocities being orthogonal to the symmetry surfaces were studied in  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not difficult to predict what is going to happen when the non - interacting fluids are aligned with each other , even in the general inhomogeneous case .",
    "let us introduce a length scale @xmath4 defined by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the hubble scalar and where the dot refers to the time derivative w.r.t .",
    "the proper clock time along the common fluid congruence . for simplicity",
    "we consider fluids with linear equations of state such that @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the pressure and energy density , respectively , and where the constant @xmath10 describes the speed of sound @xmath11 according to @xmath12 when @xmath13 .",
    "interesting examples of equations of state are : @xmath14 , which corresponds to a positive cosmological constant ; dust , @xmath15 ; radiation , @xmath16 ; and a stiff fluid , @xmath17 , for which the speed of sound is equal to that of light .",
    "local energy - momentum conservation then yields that @xmath18 , see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite . thus if @xmath19 the energy densities of fluids with smaller @xmath10 become asymptotically negligible compared to those with larger @xmath10 , while if @xmath20 the opposite holds .",
    "however , the situation is much more complicated when the non - interacting fluids are not aligned . in  @xcite",
    "bianchi type v models with two fluids and a positive cosmological constant were studied ; one of the fluids had a flow orthogonal to the symmetry surfaces while the other had a ` tilted ' flow , i.e. , its 4-velocity was not aligned with the normal to the sh surfaces . in  @xcite , where brane - world cosmology was invoked to motivate the study of multiple fluids , bianchi type vi@xmath21 with two non - interacting tilted fluids was investigated .",
    "perhaps because the focus in these papers was on the quite interesting late time behavior , there was no mentioning about the possibility of having two ( or more ) tilted fluids in bianchi type i.    the present paper is organized as follows : in the next section we derive a reduced dynamical system that describes bianchi type i with two non - interacting fluids with linear equation of state and a cosmological constant . in the subsequent section",
    "we describe the associated state space and the influence of a positive cosmological constant ; in addition we list the invariant subsets and fix points that are essential for understanding the present models . in section  [ sec : mon ] we give several monotonic functions that are useful for determining the asymptotic dynamics ; we also briefly discuss some reasons why they exist since this allows one to produce monotonic functions for other models as well .",
    "section  [ sec : attractor ] takes the results in the previous sections as the starting point for a dynamical systems analysis which yield our main results about asymptotic dynamics toward the past and toward the future , in the absence of a cosmological constant .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in section  [ sec : concl ] about the significance of our results in a more general context .",
    "appendix  [ sec : locstab ] contains detailed information about the fix points and their stability properties . throughout",
    "we use units such that @xmath22 .",

    "some of our results reflect features that hold under more general circumstances , while others are particular for the bianchi type i models with two - non - interacting fluids , but in this latter instance the present models yield a natural reference with which to compare results from more general settings .",
    "the asymptotically silent regimes of generic spacelike singularities and of an inflationary future share some properties : in the inflationary case all other matter fields than the inflationary field become test fields and do not influence the spacetime geometry  hence matter that is not inflationary matter does not matter for the spacetime geometry ; in the case of a generic singularity fluids with speeds of sound less than that of light also become test fields , in this case gravity alone creates gravity to a larger extent than matter , and hence ` matter does not matter ' in this case either  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "however , that matter fields asymptotically become test fields does not mean that they do not matter observationally , on the contrary , today to a good approximation the cmb can be regarded as a test field although it is the prime observational source for cosmology !    in the present case a cosmological constant has yielded a final de sitter state  this is a typical feature in a forever expanding model , as is the bifurcation at the radiation value @xmath16 .",

    "but it is by no means uninteresting to examine the past behavior of type i , since matter sometimes lead to bifurcations such that matter sometimes does matter , as illustrated by e.g. , a magnetic field  @xcite , or by a kinematic description of matter  @xcite where matter mattered non - generically in a very subtle way , illustrating that it was not quite obvious that there would not be any non - generic subtle effects in the present case ; the lack of such effects suggest that the past dynamics in general is structurally stable under a change from one to several fluids as long as @xmath386 .",
    "asymptotic scenarios where non - interacting matter components do not matter may have interesting consequences when one introduces more realistic interacting sources .",
    "if the interactions only contribute source terms that are proportional to the non - interacting parts of the source , then the interactions presumably also become negligible for the determination of the geometry ; it is only when interactions contribute more to the total stress - energy than the sources themselves that the matter does not matter property would be broken .",

    "there are no ( quasi- ) isotropic singularities , see e.g.  @xcite,@xcite and references therein , in the present case when @xmath333 initially .",
    "the reason for this is that the shear completely destabilizes such singularities in bianchi type i , which therefore is extremely misleading in a ( quasi- ) isotropic singularity context .",

    "the result suggests that tilted fluids may become as anisotropically significant as spatial curvature at late times ( in the absence of inflation ) when one considers more general models than bianchi type i , leading to considerable complexity , further illustrated by the type vi@xmath21 investigation in  @xcite .",
    "our results about isotropization for soft equations of state may be regarded as a non - linear bianchi type i generalization of perturbations of flat frw models with two fluids , a reasonable approximation before dark energy has becomes significant , and it is of interest then to point out that one again has radiation bifurcations .",
