    "early empirical correlations between the preponderance of young stars and gas in galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) confirmed  in a qualitative sense  the simple power - law dependence between star formation rate surface density ( @xmath15 ) and gas surface density ( @xmath16 ) first suggested by @xcite who found @xmath17 for hi gas . once the h@xmath18 component as traced by co lines was identified in galaxies , the gas surface density could be related to both hi and h@xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath19 @xcite . in a seminal paper , @xcite established this relation , hereafter called the schmidt - kennicutt ( s - k ) relation , to be : @xmath20 , averaged over entire galaxy disks .",
    "further studies by @xcite and @xcite found a nearly linear s - k relation for the molecular gas on kpc scales ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) , with the sfr surface density having a much closer correspondence with the molecular gas surface density  reflecting the well - established fact that stars form out of molecular rather than atomic gas . much theoretical effort has gone into obtaining the exponents and normalization of this relation as unique outcomes of various physical processes occurring in star forming galaxies , with various models capable of yielding ( s - k)-type relations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . it became evident that , while no deterministic microphysics of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and star formation ( sf ) can be linked to a given s - k relation , the high - density gas component ( @xmath21 ) plays a crucial role in ultimately anchoring such relations to the star formation taking place deep inside supersonically turbulent molecular clouds in disks .",
    "the s - k relations for high - density gas are particularly challenging to establish since determining the dense gas mass fraction within a galaxy requires observations of co from @xmath3 ( a total molecular gas mass tracer ) up to at least @xmath22 along with the much fainter lines of _ bona fide _ dense gas tracers like cs and heavy - rotor molecules such as hcn . a multi - component analysis of such co , hcn , and cs spectral line energy distributions ( sleds )",
    "can then yield dense gas masses , @xmath23 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , to do so for a large number of galaxies in order to obtain even a surface - integrated sfr@xmath24 s - k relation has been prohibitively expensive in telescope time . at high redshifts",
    "the situation is made worse due to a lack in sensitivity and angular resolution .",
    "nonetheless , pioneering efforts have been made at discerning @xmath25 at high redshifts using h@xmath26 maps obtained with integral field unit cameras , and high - resolution interferometric co ( @xmath3 to @xmath27 ) observations of massive star forming galaxies at @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "obviously , this situation will now improve dramatically with the advent of the atacama large millimeter / sub - millimeter array ( alma ) .    with the dense gas mass fraction distribution currently inaccessible for any statistically significant number of galaxies one must fall back to the integrated ( s - k)-proxy relations : @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the line luminosity of a dense gas tracer and @xmath31 a linear proxy of sfr ) , and then invoke theoretically determined links to an underlying s - k relation @xcite .",
    "hcn(@xmath32 ) observations of statistically significant samples of local ir luminous galaxies ( lirgs ) and normal spiral galaxies yielded the first of such ( s - k)-proxy relations using gas tracers other than co lines @xcite , finding the ir@xmath1hcn relation to be linear and with much less scatter than the previously determined ir@xmath1co low-@xmath8 relations .",
    "this was interpreted as hcn(@xmath32 ) , with its high critical density ( @xmath33 ) , being a more direct tracer of a dense , star forming gas component with a nearly constant underlying star formation efficiency ( sfe ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , with the tight , linear ir@xmath1hcn relation extending down to individual galactic molecular clouds where @xmath34 , thus covering over @xmath35 orders of magnitude in luminosity , its origin could be attributed to the existence of fundamental ` units ' of cluster star formation @xcite .",
    "this view is now further supported by the linear @xmath29 relations found also for the hcn(@xmath36 ) and cs(@xmath37 ) lines @xcite , which for cs(@xmath37 ) also extends ( linearly ) down to galactic cores @xcite . some contentious points do remain however , especially towards the high-@xmath31 end which is dominated by mergers / starbursts where a slightly super - linear ir@xmath1hcn relation has been claimed and argued to be due mostly to an increase in the dense gas sfe in such galaxies @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the first fir@xmath1co luminosity relations and the corresponding global co sleds that extend above @xmath38 and up to @xmath39 using _ herschel _ spire - fts data for local ( u)lirgs . the fir@xmath1co relations and co sleds presented in this work ( from @xmath3 up to @xmath4 ) , besides a significant extension of the @xmath8-ladder , benefit also from the inclusion of ( u)lirgs from the low- and the high-@xmath40 universe .",
    "this robustly extends the sample towards the important high-@xmath41 end ( as numerous galaxies with ulirg - like , or higher , luminosities have been found in the high-@xmath40 universe ) where very different conditions may prevail for the molecular gas , possibly leaving an imprint on the fir@xmath1co relations and the co sleds .",
    "our new high-@xmath8 co line data - set is uniquely sensitive to such an imprint since these lines need both high densities ( @xmath42 ) _ and _ ( in most circumstances ) high temperatures ( @xmath43 ) to be significantly excited .",
    "the high - density and warm gas necessary for exciting them is the most difficult phase to maintain energetically in appreciable quantities in galaxies .",
    "however , it is one that would leave no easily discernible signature in the low-@xmath8 co and low-/mid-@xmath8 sleds of heavy rotor molecular lines ( e.g. , hcn , cs ) that typically have been available for ( u)lirgs up to now . throughout",
    ", we adopt a flat cosmology with @xmath44 , and @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "for the purposes of this work we first compiled high-@xmath8 ( @xmath46 up to @xmath4 line data from the _ herschel _ comprehensive ( u)lirg emission survey ( hercules , @xcite )  an open time key program on the esa _ herschel _ space observatory @xcite which measured co @xmath46 to @xmath4 for 29 local ( @xmath47 ) ( u)lirgs using the fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) of the spire instrument @xcite .",
    "the hercules sources were selected from the @xmath48 flux - limited iras revised bright galaxy sample ( @xmath49 ; @xcite ) with separate flux cuts applied to ulirgs and lirgs ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively ) .",
    "a detailed description of the spire - fts observations , calibration modes , extraction of co line fluxes , and final line luminosities , are given in a dedicated paper ( rosenberg et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "briefly , the high spectral resolution mode was used with a resolution of @xmath52 over both observing bands .",
    "a reference measurement was used to subtract the emission from the sky , telescope , and instrument .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the herschel interactive processing environment ( hipe ) , ver .",
    "9.0 . at the time of writing ,",
    "fully reduced spire - fts co spectra were available for only 26 sources , and of these three had extended , multi - component morphologies and were discarded . since the spire - fts beam ranges from @xmath53 to @xmath54 ( fwhm ) across the bandpass @xcite , it is essential to perform a beam correction in cases where the sources are extended with respect to the beam .",
    "all spectra ( and thus co line fluxes ) were scaled to a common spatial resolution of @xmath54 using laboca @xmath55 or saboca @xmath56 maps ( see rosenberg et al .",
    ", in prep . for details ) .",
    "obviously , this assumes that the corrections are perfectly mono - chromatic in the fir and sub - millimeter ( sub - mm ) regime , which is a good assumption to within @xmath57 @xcite . for the hercules sources , which are all ( u)lirgs and thus nearly all relatively compact , and well within the beam sizes of the co observations , this correction was minor .",
    "for very extended sources , however , this correction is crucial , and failing to apply it can skew the observed fir@xmath1co relation ( i.e. , @xcite , @xcite , and see discussion in @xcite ) .    )",
    "luminosity vs.redshift for the galaxy samples considered in this paper ( after agn - dominated systems have been removed ) , along with histograms of the fir luminosity and redshift distributions ( top and right inserts , respectively ) .",
    "the local ( @xmath47 ) sources include sub - sets of the ( u)lirg samples from hercules ( 20 sources , red symbols ) and @xcite ( 42 sources , grey symbols ) the high-@xmath40 ( @xmath58 ) sources are unlensed , or weakly lensed , dsfgs ( 16 sources , green symbols ) and strongly lensed dsfgs ( 19 sources , blue symbols ) uncovered from various ( sub)-mm surveys ( see   [ section : samples - and - data ] ) .",
    "all fir luminosities have been been corrected for lensing using the magnification factors in table [ table : high - z - sample ] . ]",
    "we also included ground - based co line data presented by @xcite for a sample of 45 local ( u)lirgs from the _ iras _ rbgs .",
    "these data consisted of low-@xmath8 co transitions , i.e. , @xmath3 ( all 45 sources ) , @xmath59 ( 17 ) , @xmath27 ( 44 ) , as well as @xmath46 ( 3 ) and @xmath60 ( 12 ) observations",
    ". this allowed us to both fill - in the @xmath3 , @xmath59 , @xmath27 transitions for the 11 hercules sources that overlapped with this sample ( except for one source which did not have @xmath61 measurement ) , and bring in additional co low-@xmath8 and @xmath62 lines ( the only mid-/high-@xmath8 co lines accessible with the ground - based telescopes used ",
    "see @xcite for details ) to the sample .",
    "we stress that the co line fluxes given in @xcite are _ total _ line fluxes , and so no additional beam correction is required for these sources .    of our sample of 68 local ( u)lirgs ( listed in table [ table : low - z - sample ] ) ,",
    "30 sources ( 20 + 10 from hercules and @xcite sub - samples , respectively ) are also part of the great observatories all - sky lirg survey ( goals ; @xcite ) .",
    "to weed out active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , the sample was cross - correlated against estimates of the agn contribution to the bolometric luminosity based on several mir diagnostics such as the equivalent width of the @xmath63 pah feature , the [ nev]@xmath64[neii ] and [ oiv]@xmath64[neii ] emission line ratios as well as @xmath65-to-@xmath66 continuum flux ratios @xcite .",
    "only six sources ( indicate by a @xmath67 in table [ table : low - z - sample ] ) were found to have an agn contribution @xmath68 and were omitted from our analysis ( although , including them in our analysis did not alter the findings of this paper ) .",
    "the fir / sub - mm continuum data were obtained from a number of studies ( see @xcite and references therein ) as well as from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "all the @xmath69 and @xmath70 available fluxes were corrected for co @xmath22 , and @xmath59 line contamination ( @xmath71 ) , respectively .",
    "we also corrected for any non - thermal radio continuum contributions whenever radio data were available , allowing for a power - law extrapolation to the sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "the fir ( @xmath72 ) luminosities derived from the continuum data ( see   [ section : analysis ] for details ) span the range @xmath73 ( fig.[figure : fig0 ] ) .",
    "the two samples are well matched in luminosity , although no hercules sources are found at @xmath74 .",
    "the fact that the more luminous sources tend to have higher redshifts merely reflects the flux - limited selection of the two samples .",
    "high - redshift dusty star forming galaxies ( dsfgs ) are thought to resemble the local ( u)lirg population and most have @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , typically multiple high-@xmath8 co lines and fir/(sub)-mm continuum observations are available for them .",
    "these were the main reasons for including them in our analysis . in order to achieve the best possible uniformity , a meticulous compilation of the aforementioned observations ( co line and continuum observations ) for all published dsfgs",
    "was extracted from the literature ( guided by major review papers by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "sources with clear signs of agn ( e.g. , from optical spectroscopy showing strong ly@xmath26 , civ , and ciii emission lines and a power - law continuum , or radio - loudness ) were not included in our sample . in cases where multiple observations of the same co transition existed ,",
    "we adopted the weighted mean of the velocity - integrated line flux after discarding any outliers and measurements with low signal - to - noise .",
    "many of the high-@xmath40 co detections are of strongly lensed dsfgs , which we here take to mean a gravitational magnification factor ( @xmath76 ) @xmath77 , and in those cases we adopted the best estimates of @xmath76 available at the time of writing ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a total of 74 dsfgs constituted our initial high-@xmath40 sample . for 39 ( 53% ) of the dsfgs",
    ", however , we were unable to put reliable constraints on their fir luminosities ( see   [ section : analysis ] ) , and these were therefore discarded for the analysis presented in this paper .",
    "this left us with a final sample of 35 high-@xmath40 sources ( listed in table [ table : high - z - sample ] ) , spanning the redshift range @xmath78 with a median redshift of @xmath79 ( see also fig.[figure : fig0 ] ) .",
    "the lensed dsfgs ( 19 in total ) , _ after magnification correction _ , span a similar range in fir luminosity as the non - lensed dsfgs ( @xmath80 , see fig .",
    "[ figure : fig0 ] ) , which is about an order of magnitude higher than that of the local samples .",
    "the only exception is smmj163555.2@xmath81661150 ( @xmath82 ) , which has an intrinsic luminosity similar to that of local lirgs @xcite . within the high-@xmath40 samples , we see no strong dependence of fir luminosity on redshift , which is due to the well - known flat selection function at sub - mm wavelengths for @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "finally , we stress that while the dsfgs , as a sample , cover all co transitions from @xmath3 to @xmath84 , no individual galaxy has continuous coverage across this transition range .",

    "the latter means that the relative excitation conditions and mass between the dense gas component ( d ) and its sub - component of dense and warm gas ( d - w ) remain invariant across the sample .",
    "the trend of @xmath87 relations above @xmath12 towards increasing sub - linearity for higher @xmath8 levels is due to a decrease of @xmath212 with increasing high-@xmath8 co luminosity , thus resulting in @xmath216 .",

    "this is possible if galaxies with increasingly larger high-@xmath8 co line luminosities ( and thus also sfrs ) increasingly have a warm and dense gas component no longer tied to their sf via the average fuv / optical radiation field .",
    "such examples have been found for individual starbursts or star forming galactic nuclei @xcite , while the presence of large masses of such a molecular gas component was recently suggested as a general feature of the ism in extreme merger / starbursts @xcite .",
    "high cosmic ray ( cr ) energy densities and/or the dissipation of galaxy - wide shocks due to strong supersonic turbulence can maintain @xmath219 for large amounts of high - density gas even in the absence of fuv radiation fields ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "appreciable fractions of dense gas mass per gmc above such temperatures demand different heating mechanisms that can strongly heat the gas without readily dissociating co as fuv radiation does , and without being attenuated by dust ( i.e. , cr- and turbulent heating ) .",
    "the onset of increasing normalization factors , @xmath88 , of the @xmath87 relations above @xmath12 is then simply another result of the weakening link between the fuv - powered @xmath41 and the thermal state of dense gas for systems with high sfrs ( and high-@xmath8 co line luminosities ) .",
    "the rapid rise of @xmath130 with @xmath8-level is expected if co lines at increasingly higher-@xmath8 levels probe ever higher gas thermal states with smaller mass per ir luminosity .",

    "highly super - linear slopes can only occur for galaxy samples with significantly different dense gas fractions , or different star formation relation normalizations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , in this overall scheme , and for good ( i.e. , linear ) dense sf gas tracers such as hcn and cs lines it is rather hard to envisage how sub - linear slopes can come about @xcite , since even the high-@xmath8 transitions of these heavy - rotor molecules will trace the dense , cold star forming gas .",

    "a more direct indication of significant amounts of warm and dense gas in our ( u)lirg - dominated sample , and to what extent its thermal state is likely to be maintained by the sfr - powered average fuv radiation fields , is provided by the co sleds . in fig .",

    "nevertheless , the marked contrast between their co sleds and that of the milky way disk ( where most of bulk of the molecular gas is warmed by photoelectric heating induced by the ambient fuv radiation field ) , already indicates the presence of a different heating source . while intense x - ray radiation fields ( @xmath222 ) generated by agn can penetrate and heat gas up to @xmath223 at column densities of @xmath224 ( and without dissociating all of the co ) , it is unlikely to be the case here since great care has been taken in removing agn from our sample .",

    "if the agn was deeply buried it would not be easily detectable in x - rays and would be optically thick in the ir , possibly down to mm wavelengths .",

    "furthermore , we note that deep x - ray observations as well as mir spectroscopy of millimeter and sub - millimeter selected dsfgs ( which show no obvious signs of harboring an agn ) have shown that any agn that might be present typically contribute @xmath229 to the total ir luminosity @xcite .",
    "based on the above , we feel confident that neither the fir nor the co luminosities are biased high due to agn , and that therefore our findings are not systematically affected by agn .",
    "galaxies that are gravitationally lensed are prone to differential magnification , an effect in which regions within a galaxy are magnified by different amounts due to variations in their location within the galaxy , and/or spatial extent @xcite .",
    "this can significantly skew the observed relative contributions from hot vs.  cold dust to the ir luminosity , as well as low- vs.  high-@xmath8 co line luminosity ratios @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a flux - limited sample of strongly lensed sources will tend to preferentially select compact sources @xcite , which may be more likely to have extreme co excitation conditions . from fig .",
    "[ figure : fig5]a , however , there is nothing to suggest that the lensed dsfgs have markedly different @xmath230 values than the non - lensed and local ( u)lirgs . in fig .",
    "[ figure : fig5]b , however , we do see a few lensed dsfgs which have markedly higher @xmath231 ratios at high-@xmath8 than the other samples .",
    "this is exactly what we would expect to see if these sources were differentially lensed , and the high-@xmath8 lines tracing more compact regions than the @xmath3 line , or if the lensing preferentially selects compact sources ( which would tend to have more extreme excitation conditions ) .",
    "the strongest argument against our analysis being affected by differential magnification effects is the fact that the lensed dsfgs make up only a minor fraction of our total number of galaxies . to verify that this was indeed the case we fitted the fir@xmath1co relations without the lensed dsfgs .",
    "this resulted in slopes nearly identical to the ones given in table [ table : fits ] , and fully consistent within the errors .",
    "thus , we conclude that our findings are not affected in any significant way by differential magnification effects .",
    "utilizing _ herschel_/spire - fts observations of a statistically significant sample of 23 local ( u)lirgs , simultaneously covering the co @xmath9 to @xmath4 lines in one single spectrum , and combining these with co @xmath3 , @xmath59 , @xmath27 and @xmath36 , @xmath60 data from our comprehensive ground - based co survey of the same sample , as well for an additional 44 local ( u)lirgs , we have presented fir@xmath1co luminosity relations for the full co rotational ladder from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "included in our analysis is also a carefully groomed sample of 35 high-@xmath40 lensed and unlensed dsfgs ( spanning the redshift range @xmath232 ) with robust fir and co luminosity measurements . due to their high redshifts many of these sources",
    "have been observed in the mid- to high-@xmath8 co lines from the ground , thus allowing us to extend the mid- to high-@xmath8 fir@xmath1co relations to the highest redshifts .    for this data - set of low- and high-@xmath40",
    "merger / starburst dominated galaxies we find linear ( @xmath233 ) fir@xmath1co relations for co @xmath3 up to @xmath9 , and with nearly constant normalization ( @xmath11 ) . in light of the linear star formation relations found for hcn and cs ( e.g. , @xcite , both of which are _ bona fide _",
    "tracers of dense star forming gas , we have shown that our results are to be expected provided the dense gas mass fraction does not change significantly within the sample .",
    "our findings are also qualitatively consistent with models in which the star formation in ( u)lirgs is regulated on a global scale by radiation pressure as these predict linear @xmath234 slopes for any molecule / transition that traces star forming gas in a homogeneous sample ( i.e. , constant normalization ) @xcite .    for co @xmath12 and up to @xmath4",
    "we find increasingly sub - linear slopes and higher normalization constants , which we argue is due to these lines effectively being detached from the star formation as they trace gas that is dense ( @xmath235 ) but also radically warmer ( @xmath223 ) than what is typical for star forming gas .",
    "this dense and warm ism component is reflected in the global co sleds of the ( u)lirgs , and indeed of the high-@xmath40 dsfgs , which remain highly excited from @xmath12 up to @xmath4 .",
    "this suggests that star formation powered by fuv radiation fields is unlikely to be responsible for maintaining the gas temperature , but instead alternative heating sources are required .",
    "mechanical heating via shocks / turbulence seems to be the most plausible alternative given its effectiveness ( compared to crs ) at driving the temperatures in clouds to the required levels ( @xmath236 ) .",
    "finally , we note that our derived fir@xmath1co relations are sufficiently tight , especially for the high-@xmath8 lines , that they can predict the expected co line brightness of high-@xmath40 dsfgs , which in turn might be useful for planned observations with alma .",
