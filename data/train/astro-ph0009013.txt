    "the transient bursting source sax  j1747.0 - 2853 was discovered during a _ bepposax _ observation of the galactic bulge with the wide field cameras ( wfc , @xcite ) between 1998 march 20.3 and 22.1 ( @xcite ) , at @xmath11 from the centroid position of the x - ray transient gx  + 0.2 - 0.2 observed in outburst on 1976 ( @xcite ) .",
    "one x - ray burst with a peak intensity of about 1 crab ( 2 - 9 kev ) was firstly detected on march 21.51 .",
    "the source was then observed with the narrow field instruments ( hereafter nfi , see @xcite and references therein ) on board _ bepposax _ on march 23 ( @xcite ) allowing for an improved positioning ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 , equinox 2000.0 , @xmath14 error radius ) and a wide band spectrum to be obtained .",
    "repeated bursting activity from sax  j1747.0 - 2853 has been detected during the following wfc observations of april 3 - 4 . on 1998",
    "april 13 - 15 , during a pointed nfi observation centred on 1e1743.1 - 2843 the new transient source was at @xmath15 off - axis and imaged with the medium energy proportional counter ( mecs ) , with a reported flux of @xmath16  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath3 in the 2 - 10  kev band ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with a decreasing of about a factor of 10 compared to the first nfi observation and with an outburst exponential decay having an e - folding time of @xmath17 days .",
    "a type  i x - ray burst was also observed on april 15 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the source re - appeared in outburst on 2000 , march  2 with an average intensity of @xmath18  mcrab in the 2 - 10  kev band , increasing up to 140 mcrab on march  7.9 as observed by the _ rxte _",
    "pca ( @xcite ) and _ bepposax _ nfi ( @xcite ) .",
    "on 1998 , march 23 sax  j1747.0 - 2853 was strongly detected in all _ bepposax _ nfi instruments .",
    "we evaluated the source intensity in each energy channel of the concentrators by extracting the counts in a circular region of @xmath19 radius and scaling for the corresponding effective area . in the field - of - view ( fov ) of the mecs and of the low energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs ) two additional x - ray sources , coincident with 1e  1743.1 - 2843 and the sgr - a complex are clearly detected , along with the diffuse emission component which is present in the vicinity of sgr - a . in order to properly subtract the background",
    ", we extracted the counts from the mecs and lecs from an annulus at a distance of @xmath20 from the centre of the fov ( thus avoiding the two contaminating point sources ) having the same geometric area of the source circle .",
    "we then applied the appropriate correction for effective area .",
    "the background intensity is low ( @xmath21  % respect to the source ) and we estimate that the overall systematic error in the net source intensity is not larger than @xmath22% .",
    "the data reduction of the non - imaging instruments , namely the phoswich detector system ( pds ) and the high scintillation proportional counter ( hpgspc ) with an aperture of 1.5  @xmath23 and 1.4  @xmath23 respectively , is affected by confusion with nearby sources . in order to assess this ,",
    "we have first analyzed the mecs x - ray spectrum obtained from 1e  1743.1 - 2843 , which is located at @xmath15 from sax  j1747.0 - 2853 .",
    "this is rather soft and satisfactorily described by a single blackbody component with kt=(@xmath24 )  kev ( our fit yields a reduced @xmath25=1.14 for 156 dof ) .",
    "the total 2 - 10  kev intensity ( unabsorbed ) is @xmath26  mcrab , consistent with other nfi measurements ( @xcite ) .",
    "the contribution of 1e  1743.1 - 2843 is @xmath27  % of the total energy flux detected by the high pressure gas scintillation proportional counter ( hpgspc ) in the range 4 - 25  kev .",
    "we then decided not to include the hpgspc data in our analysis .",
    "additional contamination at high energies may come from other sources outside the fov of the concentrators . among these",
    "are a1742 - 294 , a persistent though variable x - ray burster and the microquasar 1e  1740.7 - 2942 , which are @xmath28 and @xmath29 off the pointing position , respectively .",
    "the intensity from a1742 - 294 was @xmath30  mcrab in the 2 - 28  kev energy band as detected by the wfcs on march 21 - 22 , but the extrapolation of its thermal spectrum ( @xcite ) to high energies implies only a @xmath31% contamination above @xmath30  kev .",
    "1e  1740.7 - 2942 has been extensively monitored by _ rxte _",
    "pca instrument ( @xcite ) .",
    "its intensity on 1998 , march  23 was @xmath32  mcrab ( 2 - 10  kev ) .",
    "this source features a very hard tail , and on the basis of the hardness ratio usually observed we can estimate its intensity being @xmath33  mcrab in the 30 - 150  kev energy band .",
    "hence its expected contribution to the detected flux in the pds is @xmath34  % in the whole energy range of the instrument .",
    "activity from the soft transient source ks1741 - 29 , located at @xmath35 degrees from sax  j1747.0 - 2853 was also detected on march 12 ( @xcite ) with a 2 - 10  kev flux of @xmath36  mcrab .",
    "the source then declined to @xmath37  mcrab on march 31 , and a soft spectrum was measured ( @xcite ) .",
    "the extrapolation of this spectrum to high energies yields an expected contamination of @xmath38% for the pds `` on source '' data at 30 kev .",
    "conversely , we note that any contamination in the pds from a source having an emission spectrum similar to sax  j1747.0 - 2853 would be negligible as far as we apply the standard procedure of leaving free the pds normalization relative to mecs , which is done in order to accommodate cross - calibration uncertainties ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the additional systematic error in the spectral channels is then due only to possible differences in spectral shapes .",
    "on the basis of the previous assumptions , we estimate this to be less than @xmath39% whereas the overall uncertainty in the high energy flux should be of the order of 10% .",
    "the bandpasses for the spectral analysis were limited to 1.0 - 3.0  kev for the lecs and 1.8 - 10.5  kev for the mecs to take advantage of more accurate detector calibrations .",
    "lecs data below 1  kev were ignored due to the high absorption and low source flux .",
    "the pds data analysis was limited to energies above 32 kev in order to avoid as much as possible contamination .",
    "the wfc - measured outburst light curve of sax j1747.0 - 2853 is shown in fig .  1 ( see @xcite for details on wfc data reduction and analysis ) .",
    "the source reached a peak intensity of @xmath27  mcrab with a rather slow rise and apparently rapid decay .",
    "sax j1747.0 - 2853 was observed by _ bepposax _",
    "nfi about 10 days before the outburst maximum .",
    "the source intensity is found to increase by @xmath40  % in 20 hours during this observation .",
    "we have analysed the wide band nfi spectrum of the averaged emission in the energy range 1 - 200  kev .",
    "a hard x - ray tail is present ( as detected by the pds up to @xmath4  kev ) which can be described by a power law with photon spectral index @xmath41 and a corresponding intensity of @xmath42  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath3 in the 30 - 150 kev range .",
    "the absorption column is relatively high ( @xmath5  @xmath6  10@xmath7  @xmath8 ) , consistent with the measured values of the column density in the spectra of sources observed in the galactic centre ( gc ) region ( @xcite ) .",
    "modelling the whole x - ray spectrum with an absorbed ( @xcite ) power law or an exponentially cutoff power law yields to very poor fits ( see table 1 for details ) , leaving a large residual structure near @xmath43  kev .",
    "this can be interpreted either as a broad iron line feature or the lower energy part of an absorption edge .",
    "we tried to fit the observed feature adding a broad iron like line to the continuum , using both exponentially cutoff power law and thermal comptonization ( @xcite ) . in all cases",
    "the fit results imply unacceptably high values of the pds / mecs normalization .    modelling the feature with a sharp absorption edge near 7",
    "kev provides an appropriate value of the normalization , but the reduced @xmath44 of 1.38 is still too high .",
    "conversely , a relatively good fit can be obtained for thermal comptonization by including an additional soft component ( @xmath44=1.1 ) , yielding an absorption edge at @xmath45  kev .",
    "the details of the fits are given in table 1 .",
    "the soft component may be described by blackbody emission with color temperature of @xmath10  kev , or by a multi - color disk blackbody ( @xcite ) , with a temperature @xmath46  @xmath47  kev for the inner disk region .",
    "the significance of the soft component is high if one considers the improvement in @xmath44 obtained for the comptonization continuum ( from 1.8 to 1.1 ) whereas no acceptable fit is obtained for the exponentially cutoff power law .",
    "a visual inspection of the residuals near 7 kev led us to search for an additional emission line component . using a gaussian line profile yields a narrow line emission with energy @xmath48=(@xmath49 )  kev and an equivalent width of ( @xmath50 )  ev , with a reduced @xmath44 of 0.97 over 74 dof .",
    "the significance of this detection is high ( the f - test provides a value of 9.9 of the f - statistic , for a null hypothesis probability of @xmath51 ) .",
    "we caution however , about the presence in this region of a hot thermal plasma with strong line emission from both neutral and ionized species of iron ( @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the detected line could be partly originated by the plasma emission in the line of sight of sax  j1747.0 - 2853 , or could arise as a systematic effect as far as the intensity of the diffuse component is variable on a spatial scale smaller than our source and background extraction regions .",
    "the unfolded energy spectrum obtained for the blackbody plus comptonization fit and narrow line is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "in 1998 , between mjd  50892.6 and mjd  50911.4 a total of 14 x - ray bursts was observed from sax  j1747.0 - 2853 .",
    "all these events show similar time and spectral characteristics , with fast rise , exponential decay and spectral softening .",
    "one rather strong event occurred on mjd  50900 with a peak intensity of @xmath52  mcrab ( 2 - 28  kev ) . for this burst ,",
    "the time profiles in two different energy bands ( 2 - 8  kev , 8 - 28  kev ) are both characterized by fast rise times ( @xmath21  s ) and longer exponential decays with e - folding times depending on energy band ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . in particular",
    ", the high energy time history shows clear evidence for double - peaked profile and its e - folding time is evidently shorter ( @xmath53  s ) than the one of the low energy profile ( @xmath17  s ) .",
    "the average burst spectrum is consistent with absorbed blackbody emission with average colour temperature of @xmath37  kev and the average blackbody radius of the hypothetical emitting sphere is @xmath9  km ( assuming 10  kpc distance ) .",
    "the absorption @xmath5 was set to @xmath54  @xmath8 as derived from the persistent emission observed by the nfi .",
    "four time - resolved spectra were accumulated in order to study the time evolution of the spectral parameters .",
    "the spectra were subtracted for the source persistent emission , and their time intervals were chosen to match the first - peak , interpeak , second - peak and decay phases in the 8 - 28  kev burst time profile .",
    "since the obtained emission spectra are all consistent with blackbody , we could determine the time evolution of the radius of the emitting sphere ( see lower panel of fig .",
    "the blackbody radii were calculated assuming isotropic emission at a source distance of 10  kpc and not correcting for gravitational redshift and conversion to effective blackbody temperature from colour temperature . a radius expansion by a factor of @xmath37 is observed .",
    "on the basis of the spectral and timing properties of the first bursts observed by the wfcs it is clear that the transient source sax  j1747.0 - 2853 is a type  i x - ray burster , thus indicating that the compact object is a neutron star and that the source should be classified as a candidate low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) .",
    "the photospheric expansion observed for the mjd  50900 burst can be interpreted as adiabatic expansion during a high luminosity , eddington - limited type  i burst .",
    "such bursts may be used to estimate the source distance ( assuming isotropic burst emission ) . given the observed blackbody spectrum , the burst peak intensity corresponds to an unabsorbed bolometric flux of @xmath55  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath3 .",
    "using the standard candle luminosity of @xmath56  erg  s@xmath3 , empirically calculated by @xcite on a sample of eddington limited bursters , leads to a distance value @xmath57  kpc for sax  j1747.0 - 2853 . on the other hand , assuming the theoretical eddington luminosity for a typical 1.4  @xmath58  ns ( @xmath59  erg  s@xmath3 ) and burst isotropy",
    ", we obtain @xmath60  kpc ( the error is purely statistical ) .",
    "the calculated distance of @xmath36  kpc implies an average radius of the blackbody emitting region of @xmath61  km as obtained from the observed colour temperature , i.e. without correcting for colour - to - effective temperature ratio which could lead to an underestimate of the observed radius by a factor @xmath37 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the wide band nfi spectrum of sax  j1747.0 - 2853 obtained on 1998 , march 23 ( when the source was close to outburst maximum ) can be explained as being composed of a primary non - thermal component ( detected up to @xmath4  kev ) which can be fitted by comptonization of soft photons at @xmath62  kev , plus a soft thermal component compatible with blackbody emission at @xmath10  kev or disk blackbody with an inner temperature of @xmath47  kev . the observed spectral shape ( fig .",
    "2 ) suggests that sax  j1747.0 - 2853 was in a typical low / hard state during the 1998 outburst , with a luminosity ratio l/@xmath63 .",
    "the presence of the soft component , with a total flux of @xmath64  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath3 ( i.e. , @xmath26% of the total 2 - 10  kev flux ) is in line with recent detections of a soft excess in the spectra of a number of type  i bursters observed in hard state ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) with temperatures typically in the range 0.5 - 2  kev .",
    "the spectrum shows evidence of strong reprocessing , suggestive of compton reflection and/or absorption of primary x - ray photons on optically thick material ( @xcite ) .",
    "this could be an accretion disk around a central hard x - ray source consisting of a hot plasma located either in the inner disk or in a ns boundary layer ( @xcite ) .",
    "the reprocessing of the hard x - rays is clearly revealed by the presence of an iron feature , which can be described as a combination of a rather sharp absorption edge at nearly 7.4  kev and a weak , narrow fe  k@xmath65 emission line at @xmath66  kev with an equivalent width of 55  ev .",
    "the energies of the edge and of the narrow line ( see section  3 ) seem to suggest that the material is ionized rather than cold ( @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of ionized material even at low accretion rate can be expected as far as the effective temperature of the inner disk is of the order of 0.5  kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "detections of iron edge features are generally accompanied by a characteristic hardening of the spectrum above 10  kev due to the increase of the scattering opacity at these energies ( compton reflection ) . in our case",
    "the amount of the reflection component is difficult to assess , since we do not have useful data in the range 10.5 - 32  kev and also due to the uncertain behaviour of the relative pds / mecs spectra normalization ( see discussion in section  2 ) .",
    "we thank team members of the bepposax science operation centre and science data centre for continuos support and timely actions for near - real - time detection of new transient and bursting sources and the follow - up too observations .",
