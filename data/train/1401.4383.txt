    "we answer in the affirmative a conjecture posed by hegselmann and krause about the long - term behavior of opinions in a finite group of individuals , some of them attracted to the truth , the so - called _ truth seekers_. our contribution : under mild assumptions , the opinions of all truth seekers converge to the truth , despite being distracted by individuals not attracted to the truth , the _",
    "ignorants_.    the underlying model for opinion dynamics is the _ bounded - confidence model _ : opinions , which themselves are represented by real numbers in the unit interval , are influenced by the opinions of others by means of averaging , but only if not too far away .",
    "this bounded - confidence model ( formal definitions below ) was first suggested by krause in 1997 .",
    "it received a considerable amount of attention in the artificial societies and social simulation community @xcite .",
    "the concept of truth seekers was invented in 2006 by hegselmann and krause  @xcite , along with a philosophical discussion about the scientific context with respect to the notion of truth .",
    "we blind out the philosophical discussions here and focus on the resulting dynamical system , governed by difference equations that we find interesting in their own right .",
    "the opinions of _ truth seekers _ are not only attracted by opinions of others ; they are additionally attracted by a constant number , the truth .",
    "the resulting opinion is weighted average of the result of the original bounded - confidence dynamics and the truth .",
    "individuals not attracted by the truth in this sense are _",
    "ignorants_. in their paper , hegselmann and krause show that if all individuals are truth seekers  no matter how small the weight  , then ( the opinions of ) all the individuals converge to consensus on the truth value .",
    "the question we answer in this paper arises when some of the individuals are ignorants , i.e. , the weight of the influence of the truth is zero for them .",
    "numerous simulation experiments led hegselmann and krause to the conjecture , that still the opinions of all the truth seekers finally end up at the truth . however , a proof of this fact could not be found so far .",
    "evidence by simulation only , however , bears the risk of numerical artefacts  very much so in the non - continuous bounded - confidence model .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to provide mathematically rigid proofs of structural properties of bounded - confidence dynamics .",
    "allthough the conjecture may seem self - understood at first glance because of the contraction property of the system dynamics for truth seekers , a second look on the situation reveals that the conjecture and its confirmation in this paper are far from trivial : several innocent - looking generalizations of the conjecture are actually false , as we will show below in the technical parts of the paper . relying on intuition only is dangerous .    even in the affirmative cases ,",
    "convergence turns out to be quite slow in general and far from monotone .",
    "the main difficulty is the following : the convergence of truth seekers heavily depends on their long - term influence on ignorants . depending on the configuration of ignorants and the parameters of the system , there are arbitrarily many iterations in which the truth seekers deviate from the truth .",
    "the crucial observation is that , during these iterations , the configuration of ignorants is somehow `` improved '' because the truth seekers attract them .",
    "after all , the proof is elementary but extremely technical .",
    "we introduce some structures like the _ confidence graph _ , that might prove useful also in other contexts .",
    "other structures we need are rather special , probably with limited use beyond this paper .",
    "it would , therefore , be desirable to find a more elegant proof , revealing the reason why the conjecture is true .",
    "for example : find a suitable lyapunov function .",
    "the examples we give as we go along in the proof , however , indicate that a certain amount of complexity has to be captured by the arguments because the line between true and false conjectures is extremely thin .",
    "suppose there is a set @xmath0:=\\{1,\\dots , n\\}$ ] of individuals with opinions @xmath1 $ ] at time @xmath2 for all @xmath3 $ ] , @xmath4 .",
    "the abstract truth is modeled as a constant over time , denoted by @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "the opinion of an individual @xmath3 $ ] is influenced in a time step @xmath2 only by those individuals which have a similar opinion , more precisely which have an opinion in the _ confidence interval _ of @xmath6 .    for @xmath7",

    "the _ bounded confidence dynamics _ on such a system is defined by simultaneous updates of the opinions in the following form : @xmath24 _ individuals _ are members of the index set @xmath0 $ ] .",

    "see figure  [ fig : example-0 ] for a sketch of a typical set of trajectories .",
    "remark : the term _ symmetric _ in the notion of a ( wasbocos ) refers to the confidence radius , not to the weights that individuals assign to other individuals opinions .     [ fig : example-0 ]    the main result we wish to prove is the following :    ( generalized hegselmann - krause conjecture ) [ main_result ] all truth seekers in an ( wasbocos ) @xmath27 converge to the truth  @xmath28 .",

    "note that we use @xmath29 in the statement of convergence instead of  @xmath34 because @xmath35 is traditionally used for the bounded confidence radius .",
    "it is important that convergence is not just implied by the contraction property of the dynamics with ignorants ignored .",
    "ignorants and where their opinions are make a huge difference ( see figure  [ fig : example-1 ] for an example )",

    "unfortunately , this is not possible .",
    "the speed of convergence is not determined by the structural parameters alone .",
    "this can be seen in the following simple example .",

    "but we may have _ interrupted convergence _ : in a first phase , the truth seekers come arbitrarily close to the truth in time only dependent on the structural parameters ; then , they may temporarily get distracted at some point ; finally , they converge to the truth in time depending only on the structural parameters _ and the time of distraction_. this can be formalized as follows :    [ def_interupted_convergent ] given @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , we say that truth seekers @xmath32 are ( 1-fold ) _ interrupted convergent to the truth _ , if for each @xmath58 there exist two functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 , so that for each ( wasbocos ) @xmath27 , with structural parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , there exists an @xmath61 satisfying @xmath62:\\ , |x_k(t)-h|<\\gamma,\\\\      & & \\forall k\\in k,\\,\\forall t\\ge t_2^s(\\gamma,\\varepsilon,\\alpha,\\beta , n , t_1^e):\\,|x_k(t)-h|<\\gamma .",
