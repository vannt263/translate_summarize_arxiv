    "high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) are relatively young systems , which consist of a compact object ( neutron star or black hole ) and an early - type ob star orbiting the common center of mass .",
    "first discovered in the 1970s , hmxbs are split into two individual classes  be x - ray binaries ( bexbs ) and supergiant x - ray binaries ( sgxbs ) .",
    "bexbs are transient systems where the compact object is in a wide , typically eccentric , orbit ( p@xmath510days ) around a rapidly rotating non - supergiant b - type star .",
    "the primary mode of mass transfer occurs when the compact object passes through the circumstellar decretion disc of the mass donor . in sgxbs ,",
    "the compact object is in a short ( @xmath6142day ) orbit around an ob - supergiant where the accretion mechanism is either via the powerful stellar wind and/or roche - lobe overflow . while the eccentricity in most sgxbs with short orbital periods is near zero , some sgxbs host compact objects in highly eccentric orbits ( e.g. gx 301 - 2 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in wind - accretors ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity is on the order of 10@xmath710@xmath8erg s@xmath9 .",
    "however , a much higher luminosity is found in systems where the donor fills its roche - lobe , @xmath610@xmath10erg s@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "many hmxbs host a neutron star where modulation is often seen at its rotation period .",
    "the mass of the neutron star can be constrained in eclipsing x - ray pulsars , which can lead to an improved understanding of the neutron star equation of state .",
    "currently , the neutron star mass has been constrained in 10 xrbs where the lower limit for each object corresponds to edge - on orbital inclinations and the upper limit is calculated when the donor star just fills its roche - lobe .",
    "while over 100 equations of state have been proposed @xcite , only one model is physically correct .",
    "the mass ratio between the neutron star and donor star is equal to the ratio between the semi - amplitude of the radial velocities of the donor star , @xmath11 , and the neutron star , @xmath12 . throughout the paper",
    ", we use a definition of mass ratio , @xmath13 , as the ratio of the compact object mass to that of the donor star mass .",
    "the orbital period of the binary , @xmath14 , and @xmath12 can be calculated using pulse - timing analysis , which is analogous to measuring the doppler shift of spectral lines in the optical and/or near - infrared .",
    "the projected semi - major axis can be determined from the semi - amplitude of the radial velocity of the neutron star .",
    "the semi - amplitude of the radial velocity of the donor star can be determined using optical and/or near - infrared spectroscopic information .",
    "eclipse measurements can also be exploited as timing markers to determine the binary orbital evolution of hmxbs .",
    "a significant orbital period derivative , @xmath15 , was previously found in several eclipsing hmxbs and can be used to investigate the orbital evolution over long periods of time . while several contending theories to explain the orbital decay have been investigated , the most probable explanations involve tidal interaction and rapid mass transfer between the components of the binary systems .",
    "the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) , sensitive to x - rays in the 15150kev band @xcite , provides an excellent way to study highly absorbed sgxbs .",
    "the large absorption found in these systems is problematic for instruments such as the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ all sky monitor ( asm ) , which operated in the 1.512kev band @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity to higher energy x - rays allows _",
    "swift_-bat to peer through this absorption ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we present here constraints on the mass and radius of the donor star in eclipsing xrbs .",
    "the probability of an eclipse in a supergiant xrb with an orbital period less than 20d can be expressed in terms of the orbital period , mass of the donor star , and radius of the donor star ( equation 1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the probability of an eclipse in long - period xrbs is low .",
    "using a literature search , we determined hxmb systems where bat observations can significantly improve the the properties of the stellar components and orbital evolution of the systems using eclipsing properties .",
    "five eclipsing xrbs were identified : igr j16393 - 4643 , igr j16418 - 4532 , igr j16479 - 4514 , igr j18027 - 2016 and xte j1855 - 026 , which are all highly obscured sgxbs .",
    "we note while the masses of both the donor and compact object had previously been constrained in igr j18027 - 2016 , the error on the eclipse half - angle was large at 4.5@xmath16 .",
    "the error estimates concerning the radius and mass of the donor star are significantly improved in our analysis .",
    "this paper is structured in the following order : _ swift _ bat observations and the description of the eclipse model are presented in section 2 ; section 3 focuses on individual sources that are known to be eclipsing .",
    "section 4 presents a discussion of the results and the conclusions are outlined in section 5 . if not stated otherwise , the uncertainties and limits presented in the paper are at the 1@xmath17 confidence level .",
    "the bat on board the _ swift _ spacecraft is a hard x - ray telescope operating in the 15150kev energy band @xcite .",
    "the detector is composed of cdznte where the detecting area and field of view ( fov ) are 5240@xmath18 and 1.4sr ( half - coded ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "the bat provides an all - sky hard x - ray survey with a sensitivity of @xmath61mcrab @xcite .",
    "the crab produces @xmath60.045counts @xmath19 s@xmath9 over the entire energy band .",
    "we analyzed bat data obtained during the time period mjd5341656745 ( 2005 february 152014 march 29 ) .",
    "light curves were retrieved using the extraction of the bat transient monitor data available on the nasa gsfc heasarc website @xcite , which includes orbital and daily - averaged light curves .",
    "we used the orbital light curves in the 1550kev energy band in our analysis , which have typical exposures of @xmath66min ( see section  [ five eclipsing hmxbs ] ) .",
    "the short exposures , which are somewhat less than typical _ swift _ pointing times ( @xmath620min ) , can arise due to the observing plan of _ swift _ itself where bat is primarily tasked to observe gamma - ray bursts @xcite .    the light curves were further screened to exclude bad quality points .",
    "we only considered data where the data quality flag (  data_flag \" ) was set to 0 .",
    "data flagged as  good \" are sometimes suspect , where a small number of data points with very low fluxes and implausibly small uncertainties were found @xcite .",
    "these points were removed from the light curves .",
    "we corrected the photon arrival times to the solar system barycenter .",
    "we used the scripts made available on the ohio state astronomy webpage in this paper , the barycenter - corrected times are referred to as barycenter modified julian date ( bmjd ) .",
    "we initially derived the orbital period for each xrb in our sample using discrete fourier transforms ( dfts ) of the light curves to search for periodicities in the data .",
    "we weighted the contribution of each data point to the power spectrum by its uncertainty , using the  semi - weighting \" technique @xcite , where the error bars on each data point and the excess variability of the light curve are taken into account .",
    "we derived uncertainties on the orbital periods using the expression given in @xcite .",
    "we initially modeled the eclipses using a symmetric  step and ramp \" function ( see table  [ step and ramp model ] ) where the intensities are assumed to remain constant before ingress , during eclipse and after egress and follow a linear trend during the ingress and egress transitions @xcite .",
    "the count rates before ingress , during eclipse and after egress were each considered to be free parameters and were fit as follows : @xmath20 was fit from binary phase @xmath21 - 0.2 to the start of ingress , @xmath22 was fit during eclipse and @xmath23 was fit from the end of egress to phase @xmath210.2 ( see equation  [ flux equation ] ) . while we find the eclipse profiles of igr j16393 - 4643 , igr j16418 - 4532 and igr j16479 - 4514 to be symmetric within errors , the profiles show some asymmetry in the cases of igr j18027 - 2016 and xte j1855 - 026 .",
    "we note that a symmetric  step and ramp \" function could lead to systematic errors and we therefore fit the eclipse profiles using an asymmetric  step and ramp \" function ( see equantion  [ flux equation ] and table  [ asymmetric step and ramp model ] ) .",
    "the parameters in this model are as follows : the phases corresponding to the start of ingress and start of egress , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the duration of ingress , @xmath26 , the duration of egress , @xmath27 , the pre - ingress count rate , @xmath20 , the post - egress count rate , @xmath23 , and the count rate during eclipse , @xmath22 .",
    "the eclipse duration and mid - eclipse phase are calculated using equations  [ half angle equation ] and  [ mid eclipse equation ] , respectively .",

    "we first discuss the possible scenario where we observe a partial eclipse in igr j16393 - 4643 . in our model for the eclipse ( see section  [ eclipse modeling ] ) , we assume the compact object to be a point source .",
    "while this is a valid assumption since the radius of the compact object is much smaller than that of the donor star , our approximation does not consider the extended x - ray emission region . in this case , the constraints the mass and radius of the donor star must take into account the size of the extended emission region . since a significant residual flux is observed , it is likely that we observe a partial eclipse .",
    "we also consider the possibility that the residual emission observed in igr j16393 - 4643 is attributed to a dust - scattering halo similar to what is observed in some other hmxbs ( cen x-3 ; vela x-1 ; oao 1657 - 415 , * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude a dust - scattering halo can not be the sole mechanism responsible for the residual emission seen in the folded light curves .",

    "therefore , compton scattering and reprocessing might be the sole contributor to the residual emission observed in the bat folded light curves .",
    "it is likely that a combination of the mechanisms described above account for the residual emission found in the folded light curves of igr j16393 - 4643 ( see section  [ igr j16393 - 4643 results ] ) .",
    "since the count rate during eclipse is significantly larger than what is observed in most other eclipsing hmxbs , it is likely that only a small fraction comes from a dust - scattering halo .",

    "the ingresses observed are somewhat larger than egress , which is consistent with the presence of an accretion wake @xcite .",
    "the count rate prior to ingress is also somewhat smaller than that observed after egress , providing additional evidence for accretion wakes .",
    "hardness ratios or measurements of @xmath136 folded on the orbital period could be implemented to confirm the possibility of accretion wakes .",

    ", a switch - off of the radiative driving force could lead to a reduced wind velocity and enhanced wind density .",

    "we additionally discuss how energy dependence in the asymmetric eclipse profiles can arise .",
    "the high @xmath136 , on the order of 10@xmath154atoms @xmath19 , implies the presence of a strong circumstellar wind @xcite , and the x - ray absorption due to this will lead to sharper ingress and egress transitions compared to that seen at lower energies . in a _ suzaku _",

    "while investigating the energy dependence in the eclipse transitions is beyond the scope of the present paper , this study in obscured sgxbs will be difficult due to a reduced count rate at low energies that results from the large intrinsic absorption present in these systems .",
    "finally , we consider the possibility that the asymmetric eclipse profiles could be attributed to a small to modest eccentricity . since we considered objects with relatively short orbital periods",

    "the eccentricity in igr j18027 - 2016 and xte",

    "while apsidal advance would be difficult to detect in the @xmath69yr of _ swift _ data , we believe it to be unlikely for asymmetries to be solely attributed to small to modest eccentricities .",
    "furthermore , accurate measurements of apsidal advance will depend on multiple pulse - timing measurements of these systems , which are not yet available .",
    "eclipsing x - ray binaries provide an opportunity to constrain the physical parameters of the donor star as well as the compact object . to determine the eclipse half - angle in our survey , we modeled the eclipses using both symmetric and asymmetric step - and - ramp functions .",
    "the luminosity of each system is less than expected for roche - lobe overflow @xcite , which means we can attach the constraint that the mass donor underfills the roche - lobe . since igr j18027 - 2016 and xte j1855 - 026 are the only ",
