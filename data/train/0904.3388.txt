    "correlated matter is characterized by an enormous sensitivity with respect to changes of external parameters . it is the merit of this responsiveness that a remarkable richness of properties emerges in these systems .",
    "correlation effects seem , for instance , to be a vital issue to outstanding phenomena such as high temperature superconductivity and colossal magnetoresistance . in the latter case",
    ", the possibility of tuning the fundamental behavior of a material by an external field will undoubtedly lead to yet improved data storage devices .",
    "a better understanding of the various effects of strong correlations is thus a highly desirable goal of condensed matter physics , both from the theoretical and the technological point of view .    on the experimental side ,",
    "numerous techniques have been devised for and applied to the study of correlated materials of ever growing complexity .",
    "optical spectroscopy , which is the subject of this paper , is , in a way , the most natural among them  : optical detectors are sampling the response to incident light , as do our eyes , albeit accessing frequencies , and thus phenomena , that are beyond our vision .",
    "the technique is particularly suited for tracking the evolution of the system under changes of , for instance , temperature or pressure .",
    "this is owing to a generally high precision , and the fact that , contrary to e.g.  photoemission spectroscopy or x - ray experiments , results are obtained in absolute values .",
    "especially , the existence of sum - rules allows for a quantitative assessment of transfers of spectral weight upon changes of the system properties . therewith optical spectroscopy",
    "is particularly adapted to the study of correlated materials  @xcite .",
    "on the theory side , while weakly correlated materials are well described within density functional theory ( dft)@xcite , e.g.  in the local density approximation ( lda)@xcite , and moderate correlation effects are captured by perturbative approaches , such as hedin s gw approximation@xcite , it was the advent of dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft)(for reviews see e.g.  @xcite ) , and its realistic extension , lda+dmft ( for reviews see @xcite ) , which allowed for the description and understanding of several metal - insulator transitions that are derived from the mott - hubbard or related mechanisms .",
    "though our discussion of optical properties within realistic many - body approaches is quite general , and applicable to other techniques , we present results on 2  that are based on lda+dmft calculations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows  : after having now expanded on the potency of optical spectroscopy and the motivation for more theoretical efforts , we will in the remainder of section i briefly review experimental and theoretical knowledge about vanadium dioxide . in section",
    "ii we develop our formalism for the optical conductivity within realistic calculations .",
    "section iii is devoted to a detailed discussion on fermi velocities .",
    "this part contains our major innovations .",
    "readers less interested in technical details are welcome to jump directly to section iv , which presents our theoretical optics spectra for vanadium dioxide in both , the metallic and the insulating phase .        at its metal - insulator transition  @xcite ( t@xmath1=340  k ) , 2  transforms from a metallic high temperature phase of rutile structure into an insulating monoclinic ( m1 ) phase , in which the vanadium atoms pair up to form tilted dimers along the c - axis .",
    "this m1 phase was found to be non - magnetic  @xcite .    over the decades",
    "several scenarios were evoked to explain the metal - insulator transition .",
    "this is not the emphasis of the current paper , and we shall only briefly summarize the basic electronic structure .    2  has a vanadium 3d@xmath2 configuration and the crystal field splits the 3d - manifold into 2 g  and empty  components .",
    "the former are further split into  and 1 g  orbitals . in the rutile phase",
    "these orbitals overlap , accounting for the metallic character . in the m1 phase , the 1 g  split into bonding / anti - bonding orbitals , due to the aforementioned vanadium dimerization .",
    "the goodenough scenario  @xcite of the insulator advocates the structural effect of the unit - cell doubling due to the dimer formation as the main origin of the gap - formation , and thus attributes the insulating behavior to a peierls transition@xcite .",
    "zylbersztejn and mott  @xcite on the other hand stressed the importance of local coulomb interactions , and thought the transition to be of , what we call today , the mott - hubbard type .",
    "experiments  @xcite were interpreted to support one or the other of the two scenarios .",
    "important to note is that neither of the two phases are well - described within standard band - theory approaches . in the rutile phase",
    "these miss bandwidth - narrowing and satellite features , as seen e.g.  in photoemission  @xcite , and the bad metal conductivity seen in transport measurements  @xcite . in the m1 phase , the problem is even more fundamental , since band - theory fails to produce an insulating behavior@xcite .",
    "for reviews see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "as we will detail later , the lda+dmft approach succeeds in describing the experimental findings of both , the metallic  @xcite and the insulating  @xcite phase . as a matter of fact the current calculations of optical properties rely on our previous lda+dmft work  @xcite which in particular extended on the interpretation of the nature of the insulating m1 phase .",
    "compatibility with experimental results on the optical conductivity strengthens this picture . for the insulating phase , also gw type of calculations  @xcite as well as lda+u based approaches  @xcite open the charge gap",
    "further , vo@xmath0 has also been studied within cluster based methods , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "optical measurements on 2  were first performed by barker @xcite , and verleur @xcite . by probing different orientations of single crystal samples , they evidenced an anisotropy in the optical response of the m1 insulator .",
    "more precisely , the conductivity depends on whether the electric field is parallel or perpendicular to the crystallographic rutile c - axis when going below the transition temperature .",
    "this is to be expected from the changes in the crystal - structure and the unit - cell doubling along the c - axis .",
    "this anisotropy was confirmed by ultraviolet reflectance measurements  @xcite and x - ray experiments@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "ladd  @xcite performed experiments under pressure , and noticed that c - axis stress reduces the transition temperature considerably more than is the case for hydrostatic pressure .",
    "okazaki  @xcite studied reflectance spectra of thin films with an orientation of the electric field perpendicular to the rutile c - axis as a function of temperature , and found indications for electron - phonon coupling .",
    "recent studies by qazilbash  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) on polycrystalline films with preferential @xmath3 $ ] orientation  @xcite confirmed the bad metal behavior of rutile 2  evidenced in transport experiments  @xcite .",
    "indeed , rutile 2  is found to violate  @xcite the ioffe - regel - mott limit for resistivity saturation  @xcite , i.e.  the electron mean free path is comparable to , or smaller than the lattice spacing and boltzmann transport theory breaks down .",
    "as we shall see below , pronounced differences in the optical response are found between the individual experiments .",
    "theoretically , the optical response of m1 2  was investigated by means of a self - consistent model gw calculation by continenza @xcite , which was found to improve on lda results for the dielectric function , when comparing with experiments  @xcite . also , a clear polarization dependence was evidenced .",
    "further , the dielectric response of both the metallic and the insulating phase were calculated within lda by mossanek and abbate@xcite . in the metallic phase , peak positions and the polarization dependence were qualitatively captured .",
    "the issue of the bad metallic behavior was not addressed , which is natural since it lies beyond band theory . as to the insulating m1 phase",
    ", a rigid shift was introduced to the lda band - structure , such as to `` artificially '' produce a gap .",
    "this procedure , again , resulted in qualitative agreement with experiment .",
    "however , we believe that the electronic structure is characterized by an enhanced 1 g  bonding / anti - bonding splitting  @xcite , which is not reproduced by an orbital - independent shift",
    ". an orbital - dependent one - particle potential , on the other hand , actually does correctly capture spectral properties to a surprising degree  @xcite .",
    "we will come back to this in section iii .",
    "within the field of strongly correlated electrons , calculations of the optical conductivity within the dmft framework were first performed by jarrell @xcite , and pruschke @xcite for the case of the hubbard model .",
    "rozenberg @xcite studied the phenomenology of the different optical responses of the hubbard model throughout its phase diagram in conjunction with experiments on v@xmath0o@xmath4 . in the realistic lda+dmft context",
    ", optical conductivity calculations were first performed by blmer@xcite for the case of degenerate orbitals .",
    "a more general approach , was developed in  @xcite for the study of transport properties .",
    "further , recent lda+dmft works that use simplified approaches to the fermi velocities can be found in  @xcite .",
    "our work goes along the lines of the mentioned approaches .",
    "we will however use a full hamiltonian formulation , therewith allowing for the general case of non - degenerate orbitals , and we extend the intervening fermi velocities to multi - atomic s , which becomes crucial in calculations for realistic compounds .",
    "alternative techniques were presented by perlov  @xcite in the korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) context , and by oudovenko @xcite .",
    "the idea in the latter work is to diagonalize the interacting system , which allows for the analytical performing of some occurring integrals due to the `` non - interacting '' form of the green s function .",
    "owing to the frequency - dependence of the , however , the diagonalization has to be performed for each momentum and frequency separately , so the procedure may become numerically expensive .",
    "first accounts of the presented optics scheme have been given in ref .",
    "@xcite for v@xmath0o@xmath4 ( based on the electronic structure of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , while applications can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the optical conductivity tensor @xmath5 is defined as the linear response that relates the total electric field in the solid to the charge current density @xcite  : @xmath6 here @xmath7 denote cartesian coordinates and @xmath8 indicates the quantum mechanical expectation value .    in the following",
    "we will derive an expression for the long wavelength limit ( @xmath9 ) of the real part of the conductivity tensor , which we shall refer to as the optical conductivity @xmath10 .",
    "the starting point of the derivation is the fundamental hamiltonian of the system , @xmath11 , with @xmath12 being the one - particle part , with the coupling to the ( classical ) light field via its vector potential @xmath13  : @xmath14\\psi^{\\phantom{\\dag}}_\\sigma ( {         \\hbox{\\textbf r}},t)\\ ] ] where we have chosen the coulomb gauge , @xmath15 .",

    "( [ current ] ) is the diamagnetic current , which we will drop hereafter , since its contribution to the conductivity is purely imaginary .",
    "the first term is called the paramagnetic current . for a discussion on their physical interpretation",
    "see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the current expectation value is , within the kubo linear response formalism , linked to the current - current correlation function . for the optical conductivity ,",
    "we then find @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the longwavelength - limit ( @xmath9 ) of @xmath26 which we have written in the imaginary time matsubara formalism .",
    "so far , all quantities live in the spatial continuum .",
    "as announced , we shall make the connection with many - body techniques that work in localized basis sets . at this point , however , we shall first develop the field operators in a bloch - like basis , @xmath27 . here",

    "later on , we will switch to the wannier - like , real space basis @xmath33 , to which the aforementioned notion of localization will apply . here , @xmath34 labels the unit - cell , which only in case of a one - atomic basis is equivalent to the atomic position .",
    "this distinction will prove important later on .",
    "taking the limit of long wavelengths , which in this context is the familiar dipole approximation , we find for the paramagnetic current @xmath35 with the so - called fermi velocity , or dipole matrix element @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the @xmath23-component of the momentum operator . in the evaluation of @xmath9 correlation functions in infinite dimensions ,",
    "thus in a dynamical mean - field spirit , vertex corrections are absent in the one orbital case@xcite .",
    "in other words , electron - hole interactions effectively vanish , and the two - particle quantity , eq .",
    "( [ chi ] ) , can be decoupled into the product of two one - particle green s functions . in the following",
    ", we shall neglect vertex corrections , though the above statement is not valid for the cluster or multi orbital case .",
    "indeed , one can show that only the elements of the fermi velocity that are diagonal in orbital space have the odd parity with respect to momentum that is required for the vanishing of vertex correction in @xmath38 . instead of advancing towards a more stringent two - particle formulation in the model case ,",
    "it is our objective to strive after a formalism that accounts for the complexity of realistic state - of - the - art electronic structure techniques , such as lda+dmft . with this simplification , the derivation , after continuing to real frequencies ( @xmath39 ) , yields  : @xmath40 where @xmath41 stands for the trace over orbitals and @xmath42^{-1}$ ] and",
    "@xmath43 are the orbital matrices of the momentum - resolved spectral functions and the fermi velocities , respectively .",
    "@xmath44 denotes the one - particle hamiltonian in the absence of the external field .",
    "hence , in total , the conductivity acquires the well - known form of a frequency convolution of momentum resolved spectral functions , with the fermi velocities modulating the amplitudes of the spectral weight . due to the fact , mentioned earlier , that the interaction part of the hamiltonian commutes with the charge density , the fermi velocities are those of the non - interacting problem @xmath44 .",
    "the many - body physics only enters the spectral functions via the evaluation of the expectation value in the correlation function of eq .",
    "( [ chi ] ) .",
    "the fermi velocity matrix element , eq .",
    "( [ matel ] ) , is readily evaluated when e.g.  working within a plane wave basis set . yet ,",
    "many - body techniques , such as dmft and its realistic extensions , that are geared at improving on local interactions in the spirit of the hubbard model , necessitate the use of localized orbital sets , e.g.  muffin tin derived orbitals , @xmath45mto@xcite , or other wannier functions@xcite . while a computation of the full matrix element , eq .",
    "( [ matel ] ) , is in principle still possible within these basis sets , it becomes rather tedious from the practical point of view .",
    "therefore we have devised a handy approximation , explicitly geared at the use with localized orbitals , which allows for a reliable calculation of optical properties at a rather low computational cost  @xcite .      in the above",
    ", we coupled the light field to the electronic degrees of freedom of the solid via the standard minimum coupling , and developed the continuous field operators into a basis , which led to the given fermi velocities of eq .",
    "( [ matel ] ) .",
    "a different approach is to instead develop first the hamiltonian in this basis , and to couple the vector potential directly to the site , or lattice operators in a way that verifies gauge invariance .",
    "consider the hubbard model @xmath46 then , the philosophy of the `` peierls substitution ''  @xcite approach is to add the following phase - factors to the lattice operators@xcite  : @xmath47 . here , @xmath48 denotes the atomic positions .",
    "these can be separated into @xmath49 where the former indexes the  @xmath50 and the latter the atom @xmath30 within the cell , in the case of a multi - atomic .",
    "this seemingly trivial statement will lead to important terms in the fermi velocities , which to our knowledge have so far not been considered .",
    "equally , in a multi - atomic environment , the lattice position operator @xmath51 can be defined as @xmath52 when now supposing the interactions in eq .",
    "( [ latticeh ] ) to be only of density - density type _ in the lattice operators _ ( cf .",
    "footnote above ) , then the above phases only appear in the kinetic part of the hamiltonian . when additionally assuming a slowly varying vector potential such as to approximate the integral in the exponent , the peierls approach can also be seen as a substitution for the hopping amplitudes in the above lattice hamiltonian  : @xmath53 .",
    "we further remark that evidently the vector potential only couples to non - local hopping elements , i.e.  within this approach intra - atomic transitions , @xmath54 in the above notation , are absent . from the thus defined substitution",
    ", we can compute the current either by means of the continuity equation , or by a functional derivative of the hamiltonian with respect to the vector potential .",
    "one finds @xmath55 with the velocity @xmath56 using the separation eq .",
    "( [ rpos ] ) , and introducing the usual hamiltonian element @xmath57 , we find a generalized peierls expression  : @xmath58 the first term is the familiar fermi velocity , given by the momentum derivative of the hamiltonian .",
    "it contains hopping processes that take place between _ different s _ @xmath59 . while absent in the one - atomic case , @xmath60 , the second term , which to our knowledge is new , becomes crucial , once calculations of realistic materials are performed .",
    "it accounts for hopping amplitudes between _ different atoms _ @xmath61 within the _ same _ . indeed when considering e.g.  a simple cubic one - atomic system , first in its primitive unit - cell , and then in a non - primitive  that is doubled in the direction along which the momentum derivative is taken .",
    "then it is the second term in eq .",
    "( [ vkpeierls ] ) that assures that the optical conductivities of the two equivalent descriptions are the same .",
    "when using the derivative term only , the optical conductivity comes out wrong , even qualitatively .",
    "the above formula is very handy , since the only intervening matrix element is that of the hamiltonian and its momentum derivative .",
    "no other integrals involving the lda wave functions , which are cumbersome to handle in the chosen basis , occur in this case .",
    "we note that the above expression is hermitian . yet , in general , it has no well defined parity with respect to the momentum @xmath62 , even when assuming inversion symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "only the elements that are diagonal in the atomic @xmath30-indices have the required odd parity that leads to the cancellation of vertex corrections in the limit of infinite coordination .      in the preceding section ,",
    "an expression for the fermi velocity was deduced from the _ lattice _",
    "formulation of the solid .",
    "this has to be contrasted to the proper matrix element , eq .",
    "( [ matel ] ) , that originates from the _ continuum _ description . now",
    ", a valid question is whether , and under which circumstances , the generalized peierls velocity can be employed as a reliable approximation to the true dipole matrix element . in the appendix",
    "we show that the latter can actually quite naturally be split into the generalized peierls expression and a correction term that recovers the full matrix element .",
    "the impact of this supplementary term decreases with an increasing localization of the basis functions .",
    "indeed , in the limit of strongly localized orbitals , the only missing terms are atomic transitions , which , as discussed above , are absent by construction in the ( generalized ) peierls approach , and have to be accounted for separately  @xcite .",
    "therewith , the above derived expression of the fermi velocity is particularly suited for use in wannier function setups for compounds with d or f orbitals , which satisfy the requirement of localized orbitals .    in the appendix",
    ", we give explicit expressions for going beyond the generalized peierls approach , e.g.  we derive a formula for including intra - atomic transitions within the current setup of localized orbitals . in the practical calculations for vo@xmath0 within a localized basis ,",
    "however , we found these terms to be negligible as evidenced by the good agreement between the peierls treatment and experimental findings .      many - body calculation for realistic systems often work in a downfolded setup . in other words , after a band - structure has been obtained from e.g.  an lda computation , orbitals that are supposed to be subject to only minor correlation effects are integrated out and linearized .",
    "these are typically high energy excitations , and thus the downfolding procedure is used to construct an effective low - energy problem , which is simpler to be tackled with a many - body approach .",
    "the linearization step preserves the hamiltonian form of the one - particle part of the problem .",
    "thereby the influence of correlation effects beyond the one - particle  of these orbitals , and also the possible feedback on the others , are entirely neglected , and the high energy excitation spectrum fixed to the kohn - sham eigenvalues within lda .",
    "the many - body calculation thus lives in an orbital subspace only , and all other orbital degrees of freedom remain unaffected .",
    "the introduction of a double - counting term , which corrects for correlation effects already taken into account by the lda , adjusts the center of gravity of the many - body spectrum with respect to the higher energy parts .",
    "see however e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for a way how to include uncorrelated orbitals within the lda+dmft cycle . for",
    "a recent scheme to incorporate also self - energy effects of higher energy orbitals into an effective model see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "although in the computation of the fermi velocities , eq .",
    "( [ matel ] ) , only the `` non - interacting '' hamiltonian enters , several complications occur , when it comes to deducing of optical properties from downfolded many - body calculations  : not only are transitions from and to high energy orbitals truncated , but also the optical transitions within the block of low - energy orbitals acquire wrong amplitudes .",
    "this owes to the fact that , evidently , the computation of transition matrix elements and the downfolding procedure do not commute .",
    "here one has to distinguish between the effect on the full matrix element from that on the approximation of the peierls velocity .",
    "indeed , the orbitals of the downfolded system are in general less localized than the ones of the original problem , and the peierls approximation therewith is less accurate . for an instructive discussion on this subject see also @xcite .    here",
    "we explain a simple strategy  @xcite for the computation of the optical conductivity , applicable to many - body electronic structure calculations that were performed using a downfolded one - particle hamiltonian . in line with the above remarks",
    ", this procedure yields better results than when computing the fermi velocities directly from the downfolded system .",
    "the procedure is , moreover , not limited to the use of the peierls approach .",
    "the central quantity to look at in this respect is the orbital trace of the matrix product of fermi velocities and momentum - resolved spectral functions in eq .",
    "( [ oc ] )  : @xmath63 since the trace is invariant under unitary transformations , the above can be written as @xmath64 for arbitrary unitary matrices @xmath65 . in the case of a band - structure calculation ( i.e.  a vanishing , @xmath66 ) , we can chose these matrices such that they perform the desired downfolding , i.e.  both , the spectral functions @xmath67 and the transformed hamiltonian will acquire a block - diagonal form . in the following",
    "we shall distinguish between the low energy block `` l '' and the high energy block `` h '' .",
    "an lda+dmft calculation will add local coulomb interactions only to the former , which will result in a  that lives in the `` l '' sub - block , while the orbitals of the `` h '' block will remain unchanged from the many - body ( dmft ) calculation .",
    "in other words , since both sub systems are disconnected , the block - diagonality of the spectra is retained throughout the calculation .",
    "the idea is now to compute the dipole matrix elements from the initial full system , and then to apply the same basis transformation that blockdiagonalizes the hamiltonian also to the velocities .",
    "clearly the downfolding procedure is not exact , since it linearizes the impact of the high energy orbitals . when solving the system with the full , non - downfolded , hamiltonian , the matrices that block - diagonalize the full system would not be the same .",
    "they would even depend on the frequency @xmath68 due to the dynamical nature of the . yet",
    ", when granting the approximative validity of the downfolding as such , and assuming the @xmath65 to remain unchanged with respect to the initial band - structure , we can proceed further , and by specifying @xmath69 where the spectra of the l sector are taken from the many - body calculation .",
    "then the above trace becomes @xmath70 for transitions within the block of only correlated orbitals , @xmath71 , intervenes the fermi velocity matrix @xmath72 , which is evaluated as the low - energy block of the unitary transformed matrix element of the _ full _",
    ", i.e.  non - downfolded system .",
    "the resulting velocity @xmath73 is thus different from the matrix element that is computed from the downfolded system . when using in particular the peierls expression the momentum derivative of the unitary matrices @xmath65 lead to additional terms in the latter case .",
    "moreover , with the above , a restriction to the low - energy block is not imperative .",
    "we can indeed calculate the complete optical response , including transitions from , to and within the high energy block block . while one has the possibility to suppress selected transitions by setting to zero the respective fermi - velocity matrix elements , the different contributions are in that case not additive . ] .",
    "the latter is entirely determined by the band - structure calculation .",
    "when comparing to experiments , this allows to assess whether it is only the relative position with respect to the low energy orbitals that needs an `` adjustment '' , which is connected to the double counting term , correcting for correlation effects already taken into account by the lda , or whether correlation effects modify substantially the overall spectrum of downfolded orbitals .",
    "the latter can be brought about e.g.  by non - negligible life - times , or shifts that depend on the individual orbital .",
    "we will refer to the above described scheme as `` upfolding '' , since the downfolded orbitals are reintroduced for the sake of accounting for optical transitions from , into , and between them .",
    "in a recent work  @xcite , we used an analytical continuation procedure to calculate real - frequency self - energies from lda+cluster - dmft data@xcite .",
    "this allowed for a better understanding of the impact of correlation effects , especially for the insulating phase of 2 .",
    "indeed , it was revealed that correlation effects enhance the peierls effect , while non - local fluctuations preserve the coherence of one - particle excitations .",
    "moreover we successfully constructed a static , yet orbital - dependent potential that , when added to the lda hamiltonian , reproduced the lda+cdmft excitation spectrum when artificially neglecting all lifetime effects . in our picture ,",
    "m1 2  is not a genuine mott insulator , and we referred to it as a `` many body peierls '' insulator .    here , we compute the optical conductivities of both , the metallic and the insulating phase .",
    "a comparison with experimental results will allow to further confirm the underlying lda+cdmft electronic structure calculation  @xcite , and its interpretation  @xcite .",

    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] for the metal and the insulator , respectively . in order to compute the optical conductivity also for high energies ,",
    "we employ the upfolding scheme detailed above . in the many - body cluster - dmft calculation",

    "the latter thus constitute the low energy sector , l , according to eq .",
    "( [ lh ] ) . for the calculation of the fermi velocities",

    "we sketchily write s , p ,  in the graphics .",
    "when indicating that transitions are from s , p , into the 2 g  orbitals , this mainly accounts for transitions from the occupied o2p into empty 2 g  orbitals , since , e.g. , the  to 2gtransitions are derived only from the little occupied weight of  character that stems from hybridizations with occupied orbitals .",

    "the different measurements on single crystals  @xcite also evidence a quite uniform conductivity up to 4  ev .",

    "the  orbitals were part of the downfolded high energy sector , their position , within our scheme , is frozen to the lda result ( see e.g.  the  in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore transitions from the o2p orbitals into the 2gones start , as expected , at around 2  ev .",

    ", we emphasize that the rather incoherent nature of the 2 g  weight in the spectral function  @xcite is far beyond any band - structure technique , which is why the optical conductivity in the 2.5 to 4.0  ev region , derived from o2p to 2 g  transitions , comes out too large in lda  @xcite when comparing to the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , while we find a good agreement for the lda+cdmft conductivity .    at this point",
    ", we can only speculate on the origin of the shoulder and peak structure seen in one of the experiments  @xcite at 2.5  ev , and 3.0  ev , see fig .",
    "it seems conceivable that it stems from 2 g  to o2p transitions , rather than from  contributions . attributing the humps to distinct o2p to 1 g  or  transitions is cumbersome , mostly due to the structure of the numerous oxygen bands .",
    "when looking at the momentum - resolved optical conductivity ( not shown ) , one realizes that o2p to  transitions start for most of the @xmath62-regions at lower energies than transitions into the 1 g .",
    "we now come to the optical spectra of the monoclinic phase .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show our theoretical lda+cdmft results , again , in conjunction with the three experiments  @xcite . as was the case for the metallic phase , the latter yield varying results .",
    "while the optical gap is roughly 0.5  ev in all cases , the higher energy response is markedly different .",
    "not only the amplitudes , but also the peak positions differ considerably . yet , as a matter of fact , in the current case of m1 2 , a sizable polarization dependence is expected from the structural considerations mentioned above .",
    "indeed our calculation suggests a noticeable anisotropy in the optical response , which is congruent with the experimental findings .    before interpreting the results ,",
    "however , we find it instructive to also compute the conductivities using a somewhat simpler approach  : in ref .",
    "@xcite we deduced from the lda+cdmft self - energies an effective static , yet orbital - dependent , one - particle potential that reproduced the many - body excitation spectrum , which arises when neglecting all life - time effects .",
    "therewith all correlation induced energy shifts are captured , whereas the coherence of the excitations remains infinite .",
    "this is equivalent to the use of a scissors operator , albeit one that does not simply widen the gap  @xcite , but selectively shifts the one - particle excitations that mediate the dimerization .",
    "we thus replace in a full orbital lda hamiltonian the kohn - sham eigenvalues of the 2 g  orbitals by the ones to which the additional potential was applied , and label the results `` lda+@xmath80 '' . for further details",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "therewith , we do not have to invoke the upfolding scheme of section  [ vkdf ] .",
    "what this theoretical conductivity is missing are the life - time effects encoded in the imaginary part of the lda+cdmft .",

    "[ fig3 ] displays our result , again along with the experimental curves .    when looking first at the optical conductivity that results from the effective  @xcite , `` lda+@xmath80 '' , fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] , we find all experimental polarization tendencies reproduced  : consistent with verleur et al.@xcite , the @xmath74 $ ] conductivity is lower than the @xmath75 $ ] one at energies up to 1.5  ev , after which the c - axis response develops a little maximum of spectral weight in both , experiment and theory . at energies of 2.35  ev  @xcite or 3.0",
    "ev  @xcite the experimental conductivity with @xmath74 $ ] components evidences a narrow peak . in the calculation",
    "this is prominently seen at 2.75  ev .",
    "when looking at our effective  @xcite , it seems plausible that these transitions stem from 1 g  bonding to anti - bonding orbitals .",
    "the peak is indeed very narrow for an inter - band transition , but in our picture this is simply owing to the fact that the 1 g  anti - bonding excitation does exhibit an almost dispersionless behavior  @xcite .",
    "however , already in this frequency region we expect transitions that involve the oxygen 2p orbitals , as will be detailed below for the lda+cdmft conductivity .    at still higher energies ,",
    "the @xmath74 $ ] response is again lower than for the perpendicular direction in both , experiment and theory .",
    "the overall congruity with experiments further corroborates the validity of our effective  picture for spectral properties and therewith strengthens our interpretation of the nature of the insulating phase of 2  as a realization of a `` many - body peierls '' state  @xcite .",
    "now we compare this simplified approach with the full lda+cdmft conductivities of fig .",
    "we instantly realize that the lda+cdmft response for the 2 g  orbitals is damped and therewith less structured , which was clearly expected .",
    "the small underestimation of the optical gap is probably owing to the elevated temperature at which the lda+cdmft quantum monte carlo calculation was performed  @xcite .    to shed further light on the structure of the response",
    ", we resolve in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the contributions to the @xmath77 $ ] lda+cdmft conductivity into their respective energy sectors , according to section  [ vkdf ] . from this",
    "we first infer that the slight upturn , seen for this polarization beyond 1.5  ev in the lda+cdmft conductivity is indeed derived from transitions within the 2 g  manifold , for oxygen contributions only set in at around 2.0  ev .    besides , the prominent peak in both , the experimental and lda+@xmath80 conductivity with @xmath74 $ ] polarization that we attributed above to 1g1 g  transitions , is largely suppressed and only faintly discernible as a weak shoulder , when comparing with the other polarizations .    as an explanation for this difference between experiment and the approach of the one - particle potential @xmath80 on the one hand , and the lda+cdmft result on the other , we forward the occurrence of sizable life - time effects in the lda+cdmft electronic structure calculation . indeed the 1 g  spectral weight in the corresponding 2 g  lda+cdmft spectral function is not sharply defined and extends over more than 2  ev , and is only barely discernible in the total , orbitally traced , spectrum  @xcite . when thinking of the conductivity in simple terms of density - density transitions , it is perfectly conceivable that the 1g1 g  response eventuates only in a tail of spectral weight ( as seen in the energy sector resolved conductivity in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) and not in a well defined peak .",
    "having said this , and referring to the experiments , one might thus conjecture that these life - time effects are still overestimated in the lda+cdmft calculation",
    ". moreover , we stress again that the many - body electronic structure was computed at high temperatures  @xcite , which will lead to an overestimation of the temperature induced part of the broadening  .",
    "finally , we remark that despite all differences in the experimental data , they reveal ( maybe apart from the single crystal for @xmath77 $ ] polarization ) a common global tendency , namely that , when going from the metal to the insulator , low frequency spectral weight is transfered to higher energies .",
    "indeed , for a given polarization , the drude - like weight that the insulator is lacking at low energies must be recovered , as requires the f - sum rule  @xcite .",
    "this condition is met at 5.5  ev in one experiment  @xcite , while in the other  @xcite an overcompensation appears already at energies beyond 3.5  ev .",
    "theoretically , when using the lda+cdmft conductivity , we find values of 3.73  ev and 4.35  ev , for the @xmath81 $ ] and @xmath77 $ ] direction , respectively .      in this section we shall briefly show that all the trouble with the fermi velocity is worth the effort",
    ". therefore we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for the case of m1 2  a comparison of our full scheme , which proved to yield quantitative results , with two simplified calculations .",
    "these differ from the full scheme only in the way how the fermi velocities , i.e.  the transition amplitudes are treated .",
    "we restrict the discussion to the 2 g  response .    to illustrate the effect of the downfolding of orbitals on the matrix elements , we have computed the optical conductivity when applying the generalized peierls formula on the downfolded hamiltonian .",
    "as we can see , the resulting curves differ considerably from those using the upfolding scheme .",
    "in particular , the absolute value for some polarizations is way off with respect to experiment .    it has become a popular approximation to entirely neglect fermi velocities in the computation of optical properties . therewith the conductivity is a simple convolution of momentum - resolved spectral functions . as a consequence inter - band transitions",
    "are omitted , since the fermi - velocities are simple unit matrices . especially in the realistic context",
    "this is a severe oversimplification .",
    "moreover , by construction , there can not be any orbital dependence in the conductivity , while , as evidenced from the experiments , this is clearly an important issue for m1 vo@xmath0 .",
    "also , the magnitude of intra - band transitions is not properly accounted for .",
    "in fact , the absolute value of the response is not well defined . in order for this approach to yield a comparable magnitude",
    ", we arbitrarily choose a pre - factor  : @xmath82 , with @xmath83 being the bohr radius . as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the resulting peak structure of the optical conductivity is wrong .    finally , we also compute the optical conductivity when neglecting the multi - atomic correction term in the velocities , i.e.  using only the derivative of the hamiltonian . as was the case for the velocities of the downfolded case , only for one polarization does this yield a reasonable result .",
    "in conclusion we presented a versatile scheme for the calculation of optical properties of correlated materials .",
    "geared at the use with a localized basis set , we devised a realistic extension of the peierls substitution approach .",
    "moreover , we developed means to incorporate transitions that involve high energy orbitals that were downfolded in the many - body treatment of the electronic structure .",
    "as an application , we evaluated the optical conductivity of 2  for both , the metallic and the insulating phase .",
    "while the metal is characterized by a rather isotropic response , the insulator revealed a noticeable polarization dependence .",
    "the agreement with experiments is overall satisfying .",
    "the high energy conductivity is reasonably described when using the lda band - structure for high lying orbitals .",
    "the lda+cdmft many - body calculation for the 2gorbitals correctly describes the low - energy behavior . in the rutile phase it accounts for life - time effects within the 2 g  orbitals and",
    "therewith also for the damping of oxygen to 2 g  transitions with respect to lda results . in the insulator , it allowed for a genuine reproduction of the experimental 2 g  response , capturing in particular the polarization dependence over a wide energy range .",

    "intuitively , this approach is thus particularly suited for systems in which e.g.  3d or 4f orbitals play an important role , since these verify the request of a high degree of localization .",
    "another point , worth noticing , is the fact , that , when using the peierls approximation , the result of the conductivity is actually basis dependent .",

    "<S> the aim of the present paper is to present a versatile scheme for the computation of optical properties of solids , with particular emphasis on realistic many - body calculations for correlated materials . </S>",
    "<S> geared at the use with localized basis sets , we extend the commonly known lattice `` peierls substitution '' approach to the case of multi - atomic unit cells . </S>",
    "<S> we show in how far this generalization can be deployed as an approximation to the full fermi velocity matrix elements that enter the continuum description of the response of a solid to incident light . </S>",
    "<S> we further devise an upfolding scheme to incorporate optical transitions , that involve high energy orbitals that had been downfolded in the underlying many - body calculation of the electronic structure . as an application of the scheme , we present results on a material of longstanding interest , vanadium dioxide , vo@xmath0 . using dynamical mean - field data of both , the metallic and the insulating phase </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the corresponding optical conductivities , elucidate optical transitions and find good agreement with experimental results . </S>"
