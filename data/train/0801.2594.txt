    "the antennae are a pair of colliding galaxies with an unusually large number of x - ray point sources .",
    "high resolution x - ray observations taken with _ chandra _ revealed 49 new individual sources @xcite , where previous observations only indicated extended filamentary structure @xcite .",
    "these x - ray sources range in luminosity from @xmath7 ergs s@xmath8 .",
    "most of these are thought to be x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) with a black hole compact companion @xcite .",
    "in addition to numerous x - ray sources , the antennae contain many bright , massive young clusters that are evident in both optical , _ hst _ @xcite and infrared ( ir ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth paper i ) images .",
    "this makes this pair of interacting galaxies an ideal target for studying the environments of xrbs . in (",
    "* henceforth paper ii ) we performed an extensive study of the xrb environments using _ chandra _ x - ray images and @xmath9 and @xmath1 ir images ( paper i ) .",
    "our present paper will expand on our previous study by exploring the relationship between xrbs and cluster mass in the antennae .",
    "recent theoretical models of young , massive cluster evolution provide a framework for comparison to our observational study .",
    "two in particular , @xcite , incorporate the fraction of xrbs per cluster in their models . @xcite use a population synthesis code to study the evolution of x - ray emission in young , massive clusters .",
    "@xcite investigate the role of supernova kicks in xrb expulsion from the parent cluster using the population synthesis code , startrack .",
    "they also incorporate the number of xrbs for a range in cluster mass .",
    "we will compare our measurements of the fraction of xrbs per cluster in the antennae to those predicted by these models .",
    "we organize our paper as follows : in  2 we give a brief summary of our previous work on the antennae and then define a quantity , @xmath0 , relating the xrb fraction to cluster mass in the antennae . in our analysis , we estimate cluster mass using @xmath1 luminosity , which depends non - trivially on the assumed cluster age .",
    "we explore cluster age / luminosity relations and their impact on our mass estimates in  3 .",
    "we compare @xmath0 to the measured value predicted by theoretical cluster evolutionary models and present conclusions in  4 .",
    "this paper is based on infrared ( ir ) @xmath9 ( 1.25 @xmath10 m ) and @xmath1 ( 2.15 @xmath10 m ) images of the antennae galaxies .",
    "we initially presented these data and discussed the details of their reduction in paper i. in summary , 20-minute total exposures in each filter were acquired using the wide - field infrared camera ( wirc  see @xcite for details ) on the palomar 5-m telescope during the night of march 22nd , 2002 . in paper ii , we made a frame - tie between the ir and x - ray images using ir counterparts to circumvent the poor absolute astrometric accuracy of _ chandra _",
    "( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we matched seven ir sources from the wirc images with _",
    "chandra _ x - ray point sources . using a least squares fit of a linear matching function we tied _",
    "right ascension and declination to wirc _ x , y _ pixel positions .",
    "the rms positional uncertainty is @xmath12 . with a strong astrometric frame - tie in place",
    "we were able to accurately identify ir counterparts to x - ray sources .",
    "we found 19 ir counterparts within @xmath13 of an x - ray source , 13 of which were within 1@xmath140 of an x - ray source . after estimating the ir source density",
    ", we predict only two of the `` strong '' matches ( separations @xmath15 ) and three of the `` possible '' matches ( separations between 1@xmath140  1@xmath145 ) are due to chance superpositions of unrelated objects .    in paper ii",
    ", we pointed out two important implications for these results .",
    "first , that there is clearly a significant excess of ir counterparts within @xmath16 of the x - ray sources  13 , where we expect only two in the null hypothesis of no physical counterparts . even including the `` possible '' counterparts out to @xmath13 , we have a total of 19 counterparts , where we expect only five are chance superpositions .",
    "secondly , this implies that for any given `` strong '' ir counterpart , we have a probability of @xmath17 85% ( @xmath18 with a @xmath19 uncertainty of 0.3 ) that the association with an x - ray source is real . even for the `` possible '' counterparts , the probability of true association is @xmath1750% .",
    "therefore , regardless of the physical separations between the x - ray sources and their ir counterpart , we are confident that the majority of these associations are real .",
    "we note that of the 19 x - ray sources with counterparts , two are the nuclei @xcite , one is a background quasar @xcite , and two share the same ir counterpart .",
    "therefore , in this paper we will only consider the 15 ir counterparts ( of the original 19 ) that are star clusters in the antennae .",
    "we performed aperture photometry in both the @xmath9 and @xmath1 bands on all 15 ir cluster counterparts plus an additional 204 clusters identified by eye in these ir images of the antennae ( see also paper i and the tables there - in ) .",
    "we defined our aperture as @xmath20 of the gaussian psf , where @xmath9 had a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath21 and @xmath1 had a fwhm of @xmath22 .",
    "we measured a mean and median sky background flux in two separate annuli between @xmath176 ",
    "10@xmath23 of the psf . to account for the exceptionally crowded field of the antennae , we employed the use of background arcs instead of annuli . multiplying these four measurements by the area of the central aperture and then subtracting these from the flux in the central aperture yielded four separate source flux measurements .",
    "we defined error in sky background , @xmath24 , as the standard deviation of the four measured source fluxes .",
    "we also considered poisson noise , @xmath25 , defined as the total source flux divided by the square root of the gain for the wirc instrument .",
    "the gain for wirc during the observations was @xmath26 @xcite1k detector and this is the gain for it . ] .",
    "adding @xmath24 and @xmath25 in quadrature , we computed the total error in flux , @xmath27 .",
    "we converted fluxes to magnitudes using a bright , 2mass star in the field and defined the error in magnitude , @xmath28 , as @xmath27 divided by the mean flux .",
    "typical errors in magnitude were @xmath170.06 mag in both bands , with no error above 1.0 mag .    to estimate cluster masses we needed to compute @xmath1 luminosity ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we computed @xmath29 using reddening derived from @xmath30 colors ( paper ii ) . assuming all clusters are dominated by o and b stars , their intrinsic @xmath31 colors are @xmath170.2 mag . approximating this value as 0 mag",
    ", this allowed us to estimate @xmath32 as @xmath33 @xmath34/1.33 using the extinction law defined in @xcite .",
    "we assume for now that cluster mass is proportional to @xmath1 luminosity ",
    "i.e. that the stellar composition of all clusters is the same .",
    "we defined a luminosity cutoff for statistical purposes as @xmath29 = @xmath35 mag ( see paper ii for details ) .",
    "we binned the data by 0.2 mag in @xmath29 and then calculated an average flux per bin .",
    "computing the fraction of the total number of clusters per average flux of each bin , we took this as the probability of finding a cluster with a specific mass . in figure 1",
    "we compare this probability for both clusters with x - ray sources and all clusters in the antennae .",
    "this shows that xrbs are more common in more massive clusters .",
    "this result is not surprising  as star cluster mass increases , so does the number of massive stars in it . through stellar evolution , a certain fraction of these stars will die in supernova explosions , leaving behind neutron star or black hole remnants . in turn , a fraction of these stellar remnants will retain / acquire a mass - donating companion star , becoming a detectable xrb .",
    "thus , through sheer numbers of stars in more massive clusters , we expect a greater likelihood of finding xrbs in them .",
    "this leads us to two interesting questions : 1 ) quantitatively , what cluster mass will more likely produce an xrb and 2 ) is there some intrinsic property of massive cluster physics that favors the production of xrbs , beyond simple scaling with mass ?    we believe that our large sample of ir - to - x - ray associations provides the first dataset sufficient to estimate the answers to these questions for the antennae galaxies . in our approach to answer these questions we explore the relationship between the number of x - ray detections per unit mass as a function of cluster mass in the antennae .",
    "we can formalize this expression in the following equation :    @xmath36    here , @xmath37 is the number of detected x - ray sources with an ir cluster counterpart , @xmath38 is the number of detected clusters , and @xmath39 is the fraction of x - ray sources per unit mass , all as a function of cluster mass , @xmath40 .",
    "if @xmath39 increases or decreases over a range in @xmath40 , this means there could be something peculiar about massive cluster physics to favor or suppress xrb formation .",
    "in contrast , a constant @xmath39 across all @xmath40 would indicate that more massive clusters are more likely to have an xrb simply because they have more stars .    while @xmath39 is a powerful tool in studying the number of xrbs per cluster",
    ", it requires that we know the mass of each star cluster .",
    "however , extrapolating the masses of the antennae clusters from our photometric data required models that called for estimates of ages and metallicities .",
    "while we successfully constrained these inputs and determined cluster masses ( see below and  3 ) , we first sought to compute @xmath39 in terms of a purely observable quantity  flux . calculating @xmath39 as a function of @xmath1-band flux , @xmath41 , allowed us to investigate non - model dependent trends in @xmath39 .",
    "we calculated @xmath41 for clusters with a @xmath1-band luminosity brighter than the -13.2 mag cutoff using bin sizes of @xmath42 in counts ( dn ) ( figure 2 ) .",
    "this bin size was small enough to show a trend in @xmath41 , but large enough to contain at least two clusters with x - ray sources , allowing us to assign error bars to each value of @xmath41 .",
    "the errors plotted on the graph are the measurement uncertainty in the mean value of the four @xmath41 added in quadrature with the poisson uncertainty of the mean @xmath41 in each bin . due to the small sample size per bin , we computed these uncertainties using the small number statistics formulae described in @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows that @xmath41 is roughly consistent with a constant value of @xmath43 @xmath44 with an uncertainty of @xmath45 @xmath44 .",
    "in essence , @xmath41 is comparing two different mass distributions , @xmath46 , the mass distribution for all clusters in the antennae and @xmath47 , the mass distribution for clusters with x - ray sources , normalized by flux .",
    "if there is a constant number of x - ray sources per unit cluster mass as suggested by figure 2 , then these two mass distributions should be the same .",
    "we can further corroborate this result by comparing @xmath47 and @xmath46 using a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test .",
    "the k - s test yielded a d - statistic of 0.75 and a probability of 0.107 that they are related . considering the separate cluster mass populations as two probability distributions ,",
    "each can be expressed as a cumulative distribution .",
    "the d - statistic is then the absolute value of the maximum difference between each cumulative distribution .",
    "this test quantitatively demonstrates that there is nothing peculiar about massive clusters in the antennae with associated xrbs .",
    "we also computed the pearson _",
    "linear correlation coefficient between @xmath47 and @xmath46 , finding a value of 0.99 .",
    "since a value of 1 means a perfect linear fit , this value of _ r _ further substantiates the observed relationship in @xmath41 .",
    "we then converted @xmath41 into the more conventional units of solar mass . here",
    "we assume all clusters are coeval .",
    "selecting @xmath29 listed in the bruzual - charlot ( bc ) cluster evolutionary models @xcite for a 20 myr , @xmath48 cluster as a typical value in the antennae @xcite , we converted the model @xmath29 to @xmath49 using the standard relationship between luminosity and flux .",
    "multiplying @xmath41 by @xmath49 we converted @xmath41 to solar masses : assuming a cluster metallicity of z = 0.02 , @xmath50 with an uncertainty of @xmath51 , while assuming a metallicity of z = 0.05 , @xmath52 with an uncertainty of @xmath53 .",
    "while we assume all clusters are @xmath1720 myr old , we note that the actual range in ages should be @xmath171100 myr @xcite .",
    "the bc models indicate that clusters in this age range could vary by a factor of as much as 100 in mass for a given @xmath1 luminosity .",
    "since @xmath0 is a function of mass , incorrectly assigning cluster ages has the potential to significantly impact @xmath0 . in the next section ,",
    "we explore how differences in cluster age can affect the value of @xmath0 .",
    "we investigated the effect differences in cluster age has on @xmath0 by assuming three individual age distributions for the antennae clusters : an instant burst in which all clusters are the same age , a uniform distribution , and a distribution of the form , @xmath54 @xcite . in each case",
    ", we assumed all clusters have solar metallicity ( z = 0.02 ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , we address the issue of whether the functional form of @xmath39 can be fit by a slope or if , indeed , @xmath39 is consistent with a single value , by performing a @xmath6 test .",
    "we computed the @xmath55 between the @xmath0 values for each bin and the mean value of @xmath0 , and computed the @xmath55 between the @xmath0 values for each bin and a fitted line to these values .",
    "the difference between the two value of @xmath55 , @xmath56 , indicated the significance of the fitted slope .",
    "if @xmath56 was less than one , with in one @xmath55 deviation , then this indicated that the fitted slope was insignificant . while a value of @xmath56 between one and two , with in two @xmath55 deviations , indicated only a weak slope .",
    "any value of @xmath56 greater than two meant a significant , nonzero slope in @xmath0 . for our initial case , where we estimated cluster mass using @xmath49 we found @xmath57 , suggesting a weak , but non - negligible slope , in @xmath0 .    considering the case of an instant burst in star formation",
    ", we assigned the same age to describe all clusters and picked several such values in the range 1  100 myr . applying the bc models",
    ", we converted @xmath41 to units of solar mass for a range in ages .",
    "for each distribution in @xmath0 we computed a mean value ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the mean for these values is @xmath58 = 3.3@xmath210@xmath3 @xmath4 with a standard deviation of @xmath59 = 2.9@xmath210@xmath3 @xmath4 .    performing our @xmath6 test for each distribution in @xmath0 ( see figure 3 )",
    ", we found a mean in @xmath56 of 0.86 , with a standard deviation , @xmath60 = 1.7 .",
    "this seems to indicated conflicting results .",
    "for some cases in assumed cluster age there is no significant slope in @xmath0 , while other cases show a pronounced slope .",
    "this becomes more evident by examining figure 3 , which shows a range in @xmath56 of @xmath1706.5 .",
    "incidentally , for @xmath61 , @xmath56 = 2.2 , while for @xmath62 , @xmath56 = 4.8@xmath210@xmath63 .",
    "next , we assumed a uniform age distribution for our antennae cluster sample . picking ages at random from a uniform distribution between 1  100 myr",
    ", we assigned an age to each cluster in our sample .",
    "applying the bc models , we computed each cluster s mass based on the assigned age , produced a mass distribution , and then calculated a mean @xmath0 .",
    "performing a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation , we recreated cluster mass distributions 10,000 times , producing a large sample of @xmath0 s with a mean of @xmath64 = 5.4@xmath210@xmath65 @xmath4 and @xmath66 = 6.3@xmath210@xmath67 @xmath4 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "we then administered our @xmath6 test for each realized distribution of @xmath0 , finding a mean @xmath68 = 5.9 and @xmath69 = 5.2 . in some cases",
    ", @xmath0 did nt exhibit a positive slope .",
    "therefore , we investigated whether the slope in @xmath0 tended to be mostly positive or mostly negative by multiplying each @xmath68 statistic by the sign of the slope . in doing so",
    ", we found a mean @xmath68 = 5.8 and @xmath69 = 5.3 .",
    "thus almost all distributions in @xmath0 for the uniform case had a positive slope .",
    "a more realistic approach is assuming the cluster ages are defined by a power law ( pl ) : @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "these authors derived their relationship using _ hst _ _ ubvi_h@xmath71 observations of @xmath1711,000 clusters .",
    "fitting bc models to photometry of each cluster , they generated an age distribution . in our analysis we picked ages at random according to this distribution . mirroring the procedure used for the uniform distribution case above , we created a sample of 10,000 @xmath0 values .",
    "we found a mean for this sample of @xmath72 = 8.7@xmath210@xmath65 @xmath4 and a @xmath73 = 1.2@xmath210@xmath65 @xmath4 .    performing our @xmath6 test as we did with the uniform age distribution case",
    ", we found a mean @xmath68 = 5.1 and @xmath69 = 6.0 .",
    "accounting for variations in the sign of the slope in @xmath0 , we found @xmath68 = 4.3 and @xmath69 = 6.6 . therefore , the trend in the slope of @xmath0 remains positive , but not as significantly as the uniform age distribution case .    in a final scenario",
    ", we used the cluster ages listed in the electronic table available through @xcite to fit ages to 144 clusters in our sample , including all 15 clusters associated with x - ray sources .",
    "@xcite derived ages by using three age indicators  @xmath74 and @xmath1 broadband photometry to break the age / reddening degeneracy , h@xmath75 and br@xmath76 emission to identify clusters less than 7 myr , and co band - head absorption from narrow - band images for clusters @xmath1710 myr .",
    "they then fit these data to theoretical spectra for ages @xmath77 myr using a @xmath6 minimization technique ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "following the method discussed in  2.3 , we used the bc models to convert @xmath29 to mass for those clusters with @xcite age estimates . using cluster bins of 1.0@xmath78 in mass",
    ", we computed four values for @xmath0 ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "the errors plotted on the graph are uncertainties in the mean value of @xmath0 added in quadrature with the poisson uncertainty in each bin .",
    "again , we used the small number statistic formulae in @xcite to compute these errors .",
    "we found a mean in @xmath0 of 2.2@xmath79 and @xmath80 . applying our @xmath6 test",
    ", we found @xmath56 = 1.0@xmath210@xmath81 , implying no significant slope in @xmath0 .",
    "we summarize our age analysis in figure 6 . comparing the distributions in @xmath0 for the fitted ages , instant burst , uniform and power law age distributions , all values for @xmath0 are within a factor of four . assuming an instant burst of 20 myr , @xmath0 differs by a factor of ten ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "excluding specific ages for instant bursts of cluster formation , there is little variation in the value of @xmath0 .",
    "comparing our @xmath6 test for each of the four different age assumptions indicates inconsistent results ( see table 1 ) . in the instant burst , uniform and power law cases ,",
    "the slope in @xmath0 varies from insignificant to distinctly positive , while @xmath0 has no significant slope when the ages derived by @xcite are fit to our clusters .",
    "therefore , we can not ignore that @xmath0 might have a non - zero slope and we will discuss the implications of this in the following section .",
    "through the quantity @xmath0 , our investigation revealed conflicting results with respect to the relationship between observed number of xrbs and cluster mass .",
    "we performed a @xmath6 test on the slope in @xmath0 for a variety of assumed star cluster age distributions and found some cases where the slope was insignificant , while other cases showed a distinctly positive slope .",
    "no slope indicates the observed number of xrbs per unit mass is independent of cluster mass , while a positive slope in @xmath0 suggests more xrbs per unit mass are produced in more massive clusters . in the following discussion , we will consider both a constant value in @xmath0 as well as a slope in @xmath0 , and the implications of each result .",
    "initially , we estimated cluster mass by fitting bc spectrophotometric models to cluster @xmath29 , assuming all clusters are @xmath1720 myr . recognizing that this method depends on cluster age",
    ", we explored how different assumptions of a cluster age distribution for the antennae affect @xmath0 and showed that @xmath0 varies by a factor of roughly four ; although including individual ages for the instant bursts case will increase the variations in @xmath0 to a factor of 10 .",
    "we now proceed by comparing the mean value of @xmath0 for the four different assumed age distributions , @xmath0 = 1.7@xmath210@xmath3 @xmath4 , to that predicted by models of young , massive clusters",
    ". we will compare @xmath0 to theoretical models discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in a recent study presented in @xcite , the author modeled x - ray emission from young , massive star clusters , assuming a closed system with constant mass , no dynamics and all stars are coeval , with cluster metallicities of either z = 0.02 or z = 0.008 .",
    "these models predict @xmath172 - 5% of all ob stars in a cluster should produce high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) . in the models in @xcite ,",
    "all clusters are assumed to have masses of m@xmath82 = 10@xmath83 @xmath84 with stellar masses ranging from 1  100 @xmath84 .",
    "considering the salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) of the form @xmath85 = @xmath86 and defining stars with masses @xmath87 @xmath84 as `` ob stars '' , for our purposes here , we estimated 6% of all stars in the model clusters are ob stars .",
    "therefore , 1  3@xmath210@xmath63 of all stars in a cluster with an initial mass of 3@xmath210@xmath83 @xmath84 ( set by the salpeter imf ) should produce an xrb .",
    "since the salpeter imf implies there are 7@xmath210@xmath88 stars in a cluster , then these stars should produce 7  22@xmath210@xmath89 xrbs  orders of magnitude greater than the @xmath1749 observed in the antennae . expressing @xmath0 as a fraction of xrbs - to - cluster mass , the models in @xcite suggest @xmath0 ranges from 37@xmath210@xmath90 @xmath4 .",
    "these values are greater by at least a factor of 1000 from our estimates for @xmath0 .",
    "clearly , this predicts a much larger number of compact object binaries than what we observed in the antennae .",
    "@xcite note that they were unable to detect hmxbs in three massive ( @xmath91 @xmath84 ) clusters which they predict should contain between 1 - 3 hmxbs .",
    "if our measured value for @xmath0 accurately describes the number of hmxbs formed , then it is not surprising that @xcite fail to find any .",
    "as pointed out by these authors , future modeling of hmxb formation is needed to understand the discrepancy between the predictions and observations of xrb populations in starburst galaxies .    in another study , @xcite",
    "use the binary evolution and population synthesis code , startrack @xcite , to investigate the rate of xrb formation and ejection from young , massive clusters .",
    "this program tracks stellar parameters such as radius , luminosity , mass and core mass .",
    "the simulations are stopped at the formation of a compact object .",
    "the models include mass transfer in binaries and include transient xrbs .",
    "@xcite consider cluster masses ranging from @xmath92 @xmath84 to @xmath93 @xmath84 and cluster ages from 1 to @xmath1720 myr and compute the average number of xrbs within 11000 pc of the cluster center .",
    "considering the typical cluster age in the antennae is 20 myr , @xcite predict a @xmath92 @xmath84 cluster should contain 0.13 xrbs , while 15 xrbs should reside in a @xmath93 @xmath84 cluster .",
    "here we assume that an xrb is associated with a cluster if it is within 100 pc .",
    "this separation is equivalent to @xmath16 at the distance of the antennae ( for @xmath94=75 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 ) , which is our criteria for an xrb - cluster association ( paper ii ) .",
    "these model predictions for xrb detections assume a limiting x - ray luminosity of @xmath95 = 5@xmath210@xmath96 ergs s@xmath8 , but the observed limiting luminosity in the antennae is 2@xmath210@xmath97 ergs s@xmath8 . using the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) for the antennae defined in @xcite , we scaled the xrb results of @xcite to estimate what these models would predict for the observed number of xrbs in the antennae clusters . using a xlf power law slope of @xmath75 = -0.45 @xcite ,",
    "the models predict 0.02 xrbs are observed in a @xmath92 @xmath84 cluster , while 2.7 xrbs should be seen in a @xmath93 @xmath84 cluster , at the luminosity limits of the x - ray observations . expressing these model results as a fraction of xrbs - to - cluster mass",
    ", we can directly compare them to our measured value for @xmath0 in the antennae .",
    "doing so , @xcite predict @xmath0 ranges from @xmath98 @xmath4 , with in a factor of five from our predictions for @xmath0 . as mentioned by @xcite ,",
    "several caveats exist for their models including : 1 ) assumed binary fraction of unity which could lead to over estimates of the mean number of xrbs per cluster , 2 ) the stellar , power - law imf can affect the xrb fraction per cluster , and 3 ) changes in the half - mass radius can strongly influence the median xrb distance from the cluster .",
    "these factors could potentially explain the discrepancies between their models and our observations .",
    "since some forms of @xmath0 exhibit a distinctly positive slope , these models may not always apply to @xmath0 .",
    "more importantly , a positive slope has implications for star formation scenarios in clusters . as mentioned above",
    ", a positive slope implies more xrbs per unit mass are produced in more massive clusters .",
    "if an abnormally large number of xrbs exist in a star cluster , then the progenitors of their compact objects should also posses an over abundance .",
    "since the progenitors are massive stars , this implies star formation in massive clusters favors stars at the heavier end in mass .",
    "this is not unusual .",
    "work by @xcite suggest some of the largest clusters in the milky way could have a top heavy mass function .",
    "in this paper we introduced the quantity , @xmath0 , relating the fraction of x - ray sources per unit mass as a function of cluster mass . applying this function to the antennae",
    ", we revealed several important environmental implications for the x - ray sources in the antennae .",
    "specifically , @xmath0 predicts a far different relationship between xrb formation and cluster mass than that predicted by @xcite and is broadly consistent with that predicted by @xcite .",
    "clearly , future cluster modeling with particular emphasis on the relationship between the number of xrbs in a galaxy and the galactic cluster environment is essential to explain our current observations .",
    "furthermore , a @xmath6 test demonstrated the functional form of @xmath0 did not always remain consistent with a single value , but for some assumptions for a cluster age distributions , the slope had a significantly positive value .",
    "while this could imply a top heavy mass function in massive clusters , our statistics are small .",
    "we plan to enlarge our statistical base by extending our observational study to additional starburst galaxies .",
    "we can then address whether the properties of @xmath0 depend on an individual galaxy or are consistent across all galactic environments .",

    "<S> we use the previously - identified 15 infrared star - cluster counterparts to x - ray point sources in the interacting galaxies ngc 4038/4039 ( the antennae ) to study the relationship between total cluster mass and x - ray binary number . </S>",
    "<S> this significant population of x - ray / ir associations allows us to perform , for the first time , a statistical study of x - ray point sources and their environments . </S>",
    "<S> we define a quantity , @xmath0 , relating the fraction of x - ray sources per unit mass as a function of cluster mass in the antennae . </S>",
    "<S> we compute cluster mass by fitting spectral evolutionary models to @xmath1 luminosity . considering that this method depends on cluster age , we use four different age distributions to explore the effects of cluster age on the value of @xmath0 and find it varies by less than a factor of four . </S>",
    "<S> we find a mean value of @xmath0 for these different distributions of @xmath0 = 1.7@xmath210@xmath3 @xmath4 with @xmath5 = 1.2@xmath210@xmath3 @xmath4 . performing a @xmath6 test , we demonstrate @xmath0 could exhibit a positive slope , but that it depends on the assumed distribution in cluster ages . while the estimated uncertainties in @xmath0 are factors of a few , we believe this is the first estimate made of this quantity to `` order of magnitude '' accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare our findings to theoretical models of open and globular cluster evolution , incorporating the x - ray binary fraction per cluster . </S>"
