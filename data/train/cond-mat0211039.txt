    "<S> inverse statistics in economics is considered . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the natural candidate for such statistics is the investment horizons distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this distribution of waiting times needed to achieve a predefined level of return is obtained from ( often detrended ) historic asset prices . </S>",
    "<S> such a distribution typically goes through a maximum at a time called the _ optimal investment horizon _ , @xmath0 , since this defines the most likely waiting time for obtaining a given return @xmath1 . by considering equal positive and negative levels of return </S>",
    "<S> , we report on a quantitative gain - loss asymmetry most pronounced for short horizons . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that this asymmetry reflects the market dynamics and we speculate over the origin of this asymmetry .    ,    , and    econophysics , fractional statistics , statistical physics , wavelet transform 05.30.p , 89.65.g    financial time series have been recorded and studied for many decades . with the appearance of the computer , this development has accelerated , and today large amounts of financial data are recorded daily . </S>",
    "<S> these data are used in the financial industry for statistical studies and for benchmarking . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , they can be used to measure the performance of a financial instrument . </S>",
    "<S> traditionally this has been done by studying the distribution of returns  @xcite calculated over a _ fixed _ time period @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> such distributions measure how much an initial investment , made at time @xmath3 , has gained or lost by the time @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> numerous empirical studies have demonstrated that for not too large @xmath2 s , say from a few seconds to weeks , the corresponding ( return ) distributions are characterized by so - called fat tails  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is to say that the probability for large price changes are much larger then what is to be expected from gaussian statistics , an assumption typically made in theoretical and mathematical finance  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , as @xmath2 is increased even further , the distribution of returns gradually converge to the gaussian distribution .    in the context of economics , it was recently suggested  @xcite , partly inspired by earlier work in turbulence  @xcite , to alternatively study the distribution of waiting times needed to reach a _ </S>",
    "<S> fixed _ level of return . </S>",
    "<S> these waiting times , for reasons to be clarified in the discussion below , were termed _ investment horizons _ , and the corresponding distributions the _ investment horizon distributions_. furthermore , it was shown for positive levels of return , that the distributions of investment horizons had a well - defined maximum followed by a power - law tail scaling like @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum of this distribution signifies the _ optimal investment horizon _ for an investor aiming for a given return .    in order to present the method , </S>",
    "<S> let us start by letting @xmath6 denote the asset price . </S>",
    "<S> then the logarithmic return at time @xmath3 , calculated over a time interval @xmath2 , is defined as  @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the log - return is nothing but the log - price change of the asset . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a situation where an investor is aiming for a given return level denoted @xmath1 , which may be both positive ( being `` long '' on the market ) or negative ( being `` short '' on the market ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the investment is made at time @xmath3 , then the investment horizon is defined as the time @xmath9 so that the inequality @xmath10 when @xmath11 , or @xmath12 when @xmath13 , is satisfied for the _ first _ time . </S>",
    "<S> the investment horizon distribution , @xmath14 , is then the distribution of investment horizons @xmath15 ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : djia_pdf ] ) averaged over the data .    </S>",
    "<S> a classic assumption made in theoretical finance is that the asset prices follow a geometrical brownian motion , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ @xmath16 is just a brownian motion . for a brownian motion , the investment horizon ( first passage time ) problem </S>",
    "<S> is known analytically  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that the investment horizon distribution is given by the gamma - distribution : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> note , that in the limit of large ( waiting ) times , one recovers the well - known first return probability @xmath19 . as the empirical logarithmic stock price process is known not to be brownian  @xcite , we instead suggest to use a generalized ( shifted ) gamma distribution of the form : @xmath20 as a basis for fitting the empirical investment horizon distributions . </S>",
    "<S> it will be seen below , that this form parametrize the empirically data excellently . </S>",
    "<S> note , that the distribution , eq .  ( </S>",
    "<S> [ fit - func ] ) , reduces to the gamma - distribution ( given above ) in the limit of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the maximum of this distribution , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the _ optimal investment horizon _ , is located at @xmath25 for a given level of return @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> if the underlying asset price process is geometric brownian , then one would have @xmath26 for _ all _ values of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we will later see that this is far from what is observed empirically .    </S>",
    "<S> , of the dow jones industrial average  ( djia ) over the period from may 26 , 1896 to june 5 , 2001 . </S>",
    "<S> the upper curly curve is the raw logarithmic djia price @xmath27 , while the smooth curve represents the drift on a scale larger then @xmath28 trading days . </S>",
    "<S> the lower curly curve represents the wavelet filtered logarithmic djia data , @xmath29 , defining the fluctuations of @xmath30 around the drift . ]    </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that many historic financial time series posses an ( often close to exponential ) positive drift over long time scales . </S>",
    "<S> if such a drift is present in the analyzed time series , one can obviously not compare directly the histograms for positive and negative levels of return . since we in this paper mainly will be interested in making such a comparison </S>",
    "<S> , one has to be able to reduce the effect of the drift significantly . </S>",
    "<S> one possibility for detrending the data is to use deflated asset prices . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the present study we have chosen an alternative strategy for drift removal based on the use of wavelets  @xcite , which has the advantages of being non - parametric and does not rest on any economic theory whatsoever . </S>",
    "<S> this technique has been described in detail elsewhere  @xcite , and will therefore not be repeated here . </S>",
    "<S> it suffices to say that this wavelet technique enables a separation of the original time series into a short scale ( detrended ) time series @xmath29 and a drift term @xmath31 so that @xmath32 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : djia ] , we see the effect of this procedure on the whole history of one of the major us economical indicators , namely the dow jones industrial average  ( djia ) . in this particular example , which is the one used in the analysis , the separation is set to @xmath28 trading days , corresponding to roughly @xmath33 calendar years .    based on @xmath29 for the djia , the empirical investment horizon distributions , @xmath34 , can easily be calculated for various levels of return @xmath1 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : djia_pdf ] these empirical distributions for @xmath35  ( open circles ) and @xmath36  ( open squares ) are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the solid lines in this figure are the maximum likelihood fits of the empirical data to the functional form  ( [ fit - func ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is indeed observed that the generalized gamma distribution , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fit - func ] ) , fits the empirical data well for both positive and negative levels of return . </S>",
    "<S> it has been checked separately that the quality of the fits are of comparable quality for other values of @xmath1 . however , as @xmath37 becomes large , the empirical distributions are hampered by low statistics that makes the fitting procedure more difficult .    </S>",
    "<S> the most interesting feature that can be observed from fig .  [ fig : djia_pdf ] , is the apparent asymmetry between the empirical investment horizon distributions for @xmath38 . in particular , for @xmath36 there is a higher probability , as compared to what is observed for @xmath35 , to find short investment horizons , or in other words , _ draw - downs _ are faster then _ draw - ups_. consequently , one might say that there exists a gain - loss asymmetry ! </S>",
    "<S> this result is in agreement with the drawdown / drawup analysis presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar results to those presented here have also been obtained for sp500 and nasdaq .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : djia_pdf_scaling ] depicts the optimal investment horizon _ </S>",
    "<S> vs _ level of return . from this figure </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that the asymmetry feature found for a return level of @xmath39 is not unique . for the smallest levels considered , @xmath40 </S>",
    "<S> , no asymmetry can be detected . however , as @xmath37 is gradually increased , the asymmetry starts to emerge at @xmath41 . by further increasing the level of return , a state of saturation for the asymmetry appears to be reached . in this state </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry in the optimal investment horizon for the djia is almost @xmath42  trading days .    </S>",
    "<S> these findings in fact confirms the saying in the financial industry that _ it takes time to drive up prices_. from this analysis , one may add _ compared to driving them down _ , a result that coincides with the common believe that the market reacts more violently to negative information than to positive . to our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> , this is the first time that such statements have been founded in a quantitative analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the investment horizon distributions are , in fact , ideal tools for addressing such questions quantitatively . before arriving at the conclusion of this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will take the opportunity to speculate about the reason for this asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , it can not be due to any residues of the drift left by the wavelet analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the economic expansion in the 20th century ( corresponding to the time period of the data ) has in general been positive . </S>",
    "<S> hence , if this was an effect of the drift , it should be expected that the waiting times for @xmath43 should be the shortest . </S>",
    "<S> however , from the data we find it to be the other way around . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we are led to conclude that this asymmetry is reflecting the market dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> both from the point of view of risk management and of market psychology , it makes sense that market participants reacts faster to `` bad '' news than `` good '' news .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have considered inverse statistics in economics . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that the natural candidate for such statistics is what we call the investment horizon distribution . </S>",
    "<S> such a distribution , obtained from the historic data of a given market , indicates the time span an investor historically has to wait in order to obtain a predefined level of return . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions are parametrized excellently by a shifted generalized gamma distributions for which the first moment does not exist . </S>",
    "<S> the typical waiting time , for a given level of return @xmath1 , can therefore be characterized by _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ the time position of the maximum of the distribution , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ by the _ optimal _ investment horizon . by studying the behaviour of this quantity for positive  ( gain ) and negative  ( loss ) levels of return , a very interesting and pronounced gain - loss asymmetry emerges . </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that this asymmetry is part of the market dynamics . </S>"
