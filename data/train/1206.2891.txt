    "effect ( if any ) of the sn on the tep signal was not corrected for . ]",
    "while performing these measurements , we found that samples sometimes developed cracks in the silver paste which we believe led to a decreased thermal contact between the sample and the surface of the sd package of the cernox thermometer and , as a result , somewhat noisier data with a consequently smaller absolute value of the tep over the whole temperature range : since the heater is mounted on the surface of the sd package of the cernox thermometer , the actual @xmath10 across the sample was probably smaller than that read by the sensors leading to a smaller thermoelectric voltage @xmath11 generated .",
    "( given poor contact on one or both sides of the sample , @xmath11 should not change dramatically due to zero electrical current but @xmath10 should change due to finite heat flow . )    the tep data for the sample with the crack in the silver paste and a few other from the same batch for which the silver paste contacts showed no evidence of degradation , are shown in fig .",
    "the data for the sample with the crack in the silver paste is shown in solid black curve , it is clearly noisier data with the absolute value of the tep significantly smaller compared to the absolute value of the tep of the other three samples with good thermal contact . for one of the samples ,",

    "additional contributions ( if any ) of the sn to the tep signal were not corrected for .",
    "unfortunately , a simple scaling of the data set for the sample with the crack in the silver paste , solid black curve , to the other data sets does not work most likely because the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity associated with the degraded contact is not measured or modeled .    based on these observations , in the cases",
    "when multiple tep measurements on samples from the same batch had data spread significantly beyond the expected experimental errors , within a maximum of 10@xmath12 @xcite , the data set with the largest absolute value of the tep and highest signal - to - noise ratio was taken as a more reliable measurement .",

    "given that the temperature dependent resistance and magnetization data for ba(fe@xmath0rh@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 are strikingly similar to those of ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 resulting in the phase diagrams that are almost identical @xcite , it is interesting to compare the effects of rh substitution to those of co on the temperature - dependent tep . figure 8 shows a comparison of the temperature - dependent tep for selected ba(fe@xmath0rh@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 and ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 single crystals .",
    "it can be seen , that the temperature dependence of the tep data for rh substitution levels is very similar to those for co substitution levels although the absolute value of thermoelectric power overall is slightly smaller for rh substituted samples compared to those of co substituted samples .",
    "this difference might be caused by subtle differences in how co and rh change the details of the density of states near the fermi level , and/or a differences in the scattering potential , and/or changes in phonon spectrum ( rh is a heavier than co atom with larger ionic radius and rh substitution also affects the lattice parameters in different way compared to co substitution @xcite ) .",
    "taking into account almost identical phase diagrams of co and rh substituted bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 and isoelectronic nature of substitution , the difference in the absolute value of the tep between rh and co substituted samples is more likely due to the differences in the scattering potential .",
    "tep data as a function of co concentration at 150 k are presented in fig .",
    "9 . the data set from ref .",
    "@xcite , open symbols , shows a significant jump between @xmath5=0.02 and @xmath5=0.024 . on the other hand ,",
    "the data set from this work s tighter spaced co substitution levels , shows rather gradual evolution of s(x ) with co substitution with what appears to be a change of slope at around @xmath5=0.02 of co which maybe associated with the lifshitz transition observed by arpes .",
    "if tep data at fixed temperatures as a function of concentrations are plotted @xcite , then possible changes in the fermi surface topology can sometimes be seen more clearly . according to the theory ,",
    "depending on type of the electronic topological transition : void formation or neck disruption @xcite , the features in the s versus @xmath5 at constant temperatures will be different . at helium temperatures",
    "the lifshitz transition might manifest itself as a peak in @xmath25 versus @xmath5 plot .",
    "the peak becomes broader as the temperature or amount of impurities is increased .",
    "the parameters that affect the width of the peak and the finite values of the thermopower at the peak itself are currently unknown .    in the case of ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 and ba(fe@xmath0rh@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2",
    "it is not suitable to plot the data at the helium temperature because sc exists for temperatures up to 24 k for some of the co and rh substitution levels .",
    "in addition , for any temperature cuts below 134 k , below @xmath21/@xmath22 for the parent compound , the s(x ) data will have a feature at the @xmath21/@xmath22 line crossing ; and below the structural and magnetic transitions , there is magnetic contribution to the thermoelectric power which would be difficult to disentangle from electronic contribution and which ( as opposed to phonon contribution ) could have significant concentration dependence .",
    "thus , in fig .",
    "9 , 150 k temperature was chosen so that any features associated with the structural and magnetic transitions are not contributing to the data plotted .",
    "ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 is a complex 5-band system and",
    "if one or a few bands undergo an electronic topological transition it is unclear what the experimental signature of the lifshitz transitions would look like .",
    "even if we assume that a lifshitz transition in a single band would manifest itself as a peak in s versus @xmath5 at very low temperatures , the combination of multiple bands and intermediate temperatures can be expected to mare the signature of a lifshits transition @xcite .",
    "this being said , the data from this work shown in fig .",
    "9 manifest a clear break in slope near @xmath5=0.02 , the value identified by earlier arpes measurements @xcite .    in figure 10 we plotted s(@xmath5 ) at 150 k for both co and rh substituted bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 single crystals for @xmath4 . the data for co substituted samples are the same as in fig .",
    "9 with the data for co concentrations @xmath26 taken from refs . @xcite . at a first glance",
    ", there appears to be a change in the slope at @xmath27 of rh in s(@xmath5 ) at 150 k. clearly , more measurements need to be done on a tighter spaced rh substitution levels in order to show that indeed the lifshitz transition occurs near this concentration of rh .",
    "the anomaly in the @xmath28 at @xmath29 of co , near the end of the superconducting dome , is associated with the lifshitz transition observed by arpes @xcite .",
    "an anomaly in @xmath28 for rh substituted sample is also observable just below this concentration and is marked with an arrow in fig 10 .",
    "another interesting features to point out in s(x ) are the lowest points in s(x ) for both co and rh at around @xmath5=0.06 . for this concentration the @xmath30 `` lines '' coinciding with @xmath20 `` line '' , near optimal substitution and the highest @xmath20 .",
    "this feature might be associated with significant changes of the electronic structure or other correlations as well as possible quantum critical fluctuations @xcite .",
    "resistance , magnetization , and thermoelectric power measurements on tightly spaced ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 , ( @xmath3 ) , and thermoelectric power measurements on ba(fe@xmath0rh@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 , ( @xmath4 ) , single crystals are reported .",
    "tep data for ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 evolve gradually with co substitution , instead of a large jump in the tep data from @xmath5=0.02 to @xmath5=0.024 reported earlier @xcite .",
    "the lifshitz transition , observed by arpes , appears to manifests itself as change in slope at @xmath31 of co in s(@xmath5 ) at 150 k. the temperature dependent tep data of ba(fe@xmath0rh@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 show very similar behavior to that of the ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 . change of slope in @xmath32 data for ba(fe@xmath0rh@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 , that might indicate at the lifshitz transition , occurs at concentrations similar to that in the ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 series .",
