    "the d  detector , at the tevatron , is a general purpose particle detector , composed of tracking , calorimeter , and muon systems .",
    "the tevatron collides opposing beams of protons and anti - protons , each with an energy of 0.98 tev , the 1.96 tev center of mass energy an energy makes the tevatron the first , and still only , top quark factory .",
    "top quarks at the tevatron are produced both singly and in pairs .",
    "however the single top production mode has both a smaller cross section , and more importantly a large irreducible background .",
    "when produced in pairs , both top and anti - top decay into a @xmath1 boson and @xmath2 quark , the @xmath1 boson can then decay into a lepton and neutrino or a pair of quarks , and finally the @xmath2 quarks , and any light quarks ( @xmath3,@xmath4,@xmath5 ) produced by the @xmath1 decay undergo particle showering and hadronization .    since 2001",
    "the tevatron has produced @xmath6 @xmath7 pairs , though only a fraction of those events are useful for the mass analyses .",
    "there are two lepton+jets channels used for the mass analysis , electron+jets ( e+jets ) and muon+jets ( @xmath8+jets ) .",
    "events in both channels are required to have a single isolated lepton with @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 for muons ) , to have four jets with @xmath9 and @xmath12 , and to have large missing transverse energy @xmath13 ( @xmath14 for muons ) .",
    "the main backgrounds in the lepton+jets channels come from multijet qcd , and @xmath1+jets production .",
    "the qcd signal is reduced by placing quality cuts on the leptons , and also by placing a cut on the azimuthal angle between the lepton and the @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath1+jets background is reduced by requiring that one jet be tagged using a neural network discriminant trained to distinguish b - jets from light - jets .",
    "at the tevatron , we can measure the top mass to a high precision , using three different channels , all - jets , lepton+jets , and dileptons . in all cases",
    "we assume that the mass of the top and anti - top are the same , such an equality is demanded by cpt ( charge , parity , time ) invariance  @xcite . however , we know that studies of c and p individually led to the discovery that neither symmetry is conserved by the weak interaction , and similarly a violation of cpt would require new physics to explain .",
    "the top mass measurement uses the matrix element method ( me ) .",
    "the me uses probability densities determined by integrating over the cross section for both the signal ( @xmath7 ) , and the main background ( @xmath1+jets ) .",
