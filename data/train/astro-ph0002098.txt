    "massive star - forming regions have traditionally been prime targets for astrochemistry owing to their bright molecular lines ( e.g. , johansson et al .",
    "1984 , cummins et al .",
    "1986 , irvine et al .  1987 , ohishi 1997 )",
    ". massive young stellar objects ( ysos ) have luminosities of @xmath1 l@xmath2 and involve young o- and b - type stars . because their formation proceeds more rapidly than that of low - mass stars and involves ionizing radiation , substantial chemical differences may be expected .",
    "the formation of high mass stars is much less well understood than that of low - mass stars .",
    "for example , observational phenomena such as ultracompact h ii regions , hot cores , masers and outflows have not yet been linked into a single evolutionary picture .",
    "chemistry may well be an important diagnostic tool in establishing such a sequence .",
    "most of the early work on massive star - forming regions has centered on two sources , orion  kl and sgrb2 . numerous line surveys at millimeter ( e.g. , blake et al .",
    "1987 , turner 1991 ) and submillimeter ( jewell et al .  1989 , sutton et al .",
    "1991 , 1995 , schilke et al .  1997 ) wavelengths have led to an extensive inventory of molecules through identification of thousands of lines .",
    "in addition , the surveys have shown strong chemical variations between different sources .    in recent years , new observational tools have allowed a more detailed and systematic study of the envelopes of massive ysos .",
    "submillimeter observations routinely sample smaller beams ( typically 15@xmath3 vs.  30@xmath31@xmath4 ) and higher critical densities ( @xmath5 vs.  @xmath6 @xmath7 ) than the earlier work .",
    "moreover , interferometers at 3 and 1 millimeter provide maps with resolutions of @xmath85@xmath3 . finally , ground- and space - based infrared observations allow both the gas and the ices to be sampled ( e.g. , evans et al .  1991 , van dishoeck et al .  1999 ) .",
    "these observational developments have led to a revival of the study of massive star formation within the last few years .",
    "recent overviews of the physical aspects of high - mass star formation are found in churchwell ( 1999 ) and garay & lizano ( 1999 ) .    in this brief review",
    ", we will first summarize available observational diagnostics to study the different phases and physical components associated with massive star formation .",
    "subsequently , an overview of recent results on intermediate mass ysos is given , which are often better characterized than their high - mass counterparts because of their closer distance .",
    "subsequently , we will discuss a specific sample of embedded massive ysos which have been studied through a combination of infrared and submillimeter data .",
    "after illustrating the modeling techniques , we address the question how the observed chemical variations are related to evolutionary effects , different conditions in the envelope ( e.g. , @xmath9 , mass ) or different luminosities of the ysos .",

    "the majority of molecules are detected at ( sub-)millimeter wavelengths , and line surveys highlight the large variations in chemical composition between different ysos , both within the same parent molecular cloud and between different clouds .",
    "the recent 13 mm surveys of sgr  b2 ( nummelin et al .  1998 , ohishi & kaifu 1999 ) dramatically illustrate the strong variations between various positions ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "the north position is typical of ` hot core'-type spectra , which are rich in lines of saturated organic molecules .",
    "this position has also been named the ` large molecule heimat ' ( e.g. , kuan & snyder 1994 , liu & snyder 1999 ) .",
    "the middle position has strong so and so@xmath10 lines , whereas the northwest position has a less - crowded spectrum with lines of ions and long carbon chains .",
    "a similar differentiation has been observed for three positions in the w  3 giant molecular cloud by helmich & van dishoeck ( 1997 ) , who suggested an evolutionary sequence based on the chemistry .",
    "the availability of complete infrared spectra from 2.4200 @xmath11 m with the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) allows complementary variations in infrared features to be studied .",
    "figure  2 shows an example of iso  sws and lws spectra of two objects : cep a ( @xmath12 l@xmath13 ) and s  106 ( @xmath14 l@xmath13 ) .",
    "the cep a spectrum is characteristic of the deeply embedded phase , in which the silicates and ices in the cold envelope are seen in absorption .",
    "the s  106 spectrum is typical of a more evolved massive yso , with strong atomic and ionic lines in emission and prominent pah features .",

    "( 1998 ) for a set of southern massive young stars with luminosities up to @xmath15 l@xmath13 .    the most successful models for explaining these different chemical characteristics involve accretion of species in an icy mantle during the ( pre-)collapse phase , followed by grain - surface chemistry and evaporation of ices once the yso has started to heat its surroundings ( e.g. , millar 1997 ) .",
    "the evaporated molecules subsequently drive a rapid high - temperature gas - phase chemistry for a period of @xmath16 yr , resulting in complex , saturated organic molecules ( e.g. , charnley et al .  1992 , 1995 ;",

    "once most of the envelope has cleared , the ultraviolet radiation can escape and forms a photon - dominated region ( pdr ) at the surrounding cloud material , in which molecules are dissociated into radicals ( e.g. , hcn @xmath18 cn ) and pah molecules excited to produce infrared emission . the ( ultra-)compact h  ii region gives rise to strong ionic lines due to photoionization .",

    "many of these components are blended together and interferometer observations will be essential to disentangle them .",
    "nevertheless , the single - dish data are useful because they encompass the entire envelope and highlight the dominant component in the beam . combined with the above chemical scenario",
    ", one may then attempt to establish an evolutionary sequence of the sources .",
    "the physical distinction between the ` hot core ' and the warm inner envelope listed in table  1 is currently not clear : does the ` hot core ' represent a separate physical component or is it simply the inner warm envelope at a different stage of chemical evolution ? even from an observational point of view , there appear to be different types of ` hot cores ' : some of them are internally heated by the young star ( e.g. , w  3(h@xmath10o ) ) , whereas others may just be dense clumps of gas heated externally ( e.g. , the orion compact ridge ) .",
    "this point will be further discussed in ",

    "disks are not included in table  1 , because little is known about their chemical characteristics , or even their existence , around high - mass ysos ( see norris , this volume ) .",
    "intermediate - mass pre - main sequence stars , in particular the so - called herbig ae / be stars , have received increased observational attention in recent years ( see waters & waelkens 1998 for a review ) .",
    "these stars have spectral type a or b and show infrared excesses due to circumstellar dust .",
    "typical luminosities are in the range @xmath22 l@xmath13 , and several objects have been located within 1 kpc distance .",

    "the increasing importance of photodissociation in the chemistry is probed by the increase in the cn / hcn abundance ratio .",
    "this ratio has been shown in other high - mass sources to be an excellent tracer of pdrs ( e.g. , simon et al .",
    "1997 , jansen et al .",
    "line surveys of these objects in selected frequency ranges would be useful to investigate their chemical complexity , especially in the embedded phase .",

    "shock indicators such as [ s i ] 25.2 @xmath11 m are strong , whereas in the later phases pdr indicators such as pahs are prominent .",
    "an excellent example of this evolutionary sequence is provided by three herbig ae stars in the bd+40@xmath244124 region ( @xmath25 kpc ) .",
    "the data suggest that in the early phases , the heating of the envelope is dominated by shocks , whereas in later phases it is controlled by ultraviolet photons .",

    "1998 , cernicharo et al .",
    "1997 , wright et al .",
    ". the absence of h@xmath10o lines in higher - mass objects may be partly due to the larger distance of these objects , resulting in substantial dilution in the lws beam .",
    "however , photodissociation of h@xmath10o to oh and o by the enhanced ultraviolet radiation may also play a role .    in summary , both the submillimeter and infrared diagnostics reveal an evolutionary sequence from the youngest ` group i ' objects to ` group iii ' objects ( cf .  classification by fuente et al .",
    "1998 ) , in which the envelope is gradually dispersed .",

    "the dust opacity has been taken from ossenkopf & henning ( 1994 ) and yields values for the mass which are consistent with those derived from c@xmath34o for warm sources where co is not depleted onto grains .",
    "the temperature structure of the dust is calculated taking the observed luminosity of the source , given a power - law density structure ( see below ) . at large distances from the star ,",

    "it is assumed that @xmath36 , consistent with explicit calculations of the gas and dust temperatures by , e.g. , doty & neufeld ( 1997 ) for these high densities .",
    "the continuum data are sensitive to temperature and column density , but not to density .",
    "observations of a molecule with a large dipole moment are needed to subsequently constrain the density structure .",
    "one of the best choices is cs and its isotope c@xmath37s , for which lines ranging from @xmath27=21 to 109 have been observed . assuming a power - law density profile @xmath38 , values of @xmath23 can be determined from minimizing @xmath39 between the cs line data and excitation models .",

    "two extreme , but chemically plausible models are considered : ( i ) a model with a constant abundance throughout the envelope .",
    "this model is motivated by the fact that pure gas - phase reaction schemes do not show large variations in calculated abundances between 20 and 100  k ; ( ii ) a model in which the abundance ` jumps ' to a higher value at the ice evaporation temperature , @xmath56  k. in this model , the abundances in the outer envelope are set at those observed in cold clouds , so that the only free parameter is the amount of abundance increase .",
    "it is found that the h@xmath10co data can be well fit with a constant abundance of a few @xmath57 throughout the envelope . however , the high @xmath58 data for ch@xmath17oh require a jump in its abundance from @xmath59 to @xmath60 for the warmer sources .",
    "this is consistent with the derived excitation temperatures : h@xmath10co has a rather narrow range of @xmath48=5090  k , whereas ch@xmath17oh shows @xmath48=30200  k. moreover , the interferometer maps of ch@xmath17oh rule out constant abundance models .",

    "similar increases in the abundances of organic molecules ( e.g. , ch@xmath17oh , c@xmath10h@xmath17cn , .... ) are found with increasing @xmath62 for a set of ` hot  core ' objects by ikeda & ohishi ( 1999 ) .",
    "both the infrared and submillimeter data show increases in the abundances of various molecules with increasing temperature .",
    "four types of species can be distinguished : ( i ) ` passive ' molecules which are formed in the gas phase , freeze out onto grains during the cold ( pre-)collapse phase and are released during warm - up without chemical modification ( e.g. , co , c@xmath10h@xmath10 ) ; ( ii ) molecules which are formed on the grains during the cold phase by surface reactions and are subsequently released into the warm gas ( e.g. , ch@xmath17oh ) ; ( iii ) molecules which are formed in the warm gas by gas - phase reactions with evaporated molecules ( e.g. , ch@xmath17och@xmath17 ) ; ( iv ) molecules which are formed in the hot gas by high temperature reactions ( e.g. , hcn ) .",
    "these types of molecules are associated with characteristic temperatures of ( a ) @xmath63  k , where co is frozen out ; the presence of co ice is thought to be essential for the formation of ch@xmath17oh ; ( b ) @xmath64  k , where all ices evaporate on a time scale of @xmath65 yr ; and ( c ) @xmath66  k , where gas - phase reactions drive the available atomic oxygen into water through the reactions o + h@xmath10 @xmath18 oh @xmath18 h@xmath10o ( ceccarelli et al .  1996 , charnley 1997 ) .",
    "atomic oxygen is one of the main destroyers of radicals and carbon chains , so that its absence leads to enhanced abundances of species like hcn and hc@xmath17n in hot gas .",
    "water is abundantly formed on the grains , but the fact that the h@xmath10o abundance in the hot gas is not as large as that of the ices suggests that h@xmath10o is broken down to o and oh after evaporation by reactions with h@xmath33 .",
    "h@xmath10o can subsequently be reformed in warm gas at temperatures above @xmath28230  k , but figure  7 indicates that not all available gas - phase oxygen is driven into h@xmath10o , as the models suggest .",
    "the low abundance of co@xmath10 in the warm gas is still a puzzle , since evaporation of abundant co@xmath10 ice is observed .",
    "the molecule must be broken down rapidly in the warm gas , with no reformation through the co + oh @xmath18 co@xmath10 reaction ( see question by minh ) .",
    "the objects studied by van der tak et al .",
    "( 2000a ) are all in an early stage of evolution , when the young stars are still deeply embedded in their collapsing envelope . nevertheless , even within this narrow evolutionary range ,",
    "there is ample evidence for physical and chemical differentiation of the sources .",
    "this is clearly traced by the increase in the gas / solid ratios , the increase in abundances of several molecules , the decrease in the ice abundances , and the increase of the amount of crystalline ice with increasing temperature ( boogert et al .",
    "2000a ) .",
    "the fact that the various indicators involve different characteristic temperatures ranging from @xmath6750 k ( evaporation of apolar ices ) to 1000 k ( @xmath48 of gas - phase molecules ) indicates that the heating is not a local effect , but that ` global warming ' occurs throughout the envelope .",
    "moreover , it can not be a geometrical line - of - sight effect in the mid - infrared data , since the far  infrared continuum ( 45/100 @xmath11 m ) and submillimeter line data ( ch@xmath17oh ) show the same trend .",
    "shocks with different filling factors are excluded for the same reason .",
    "can we relate this ` global warming ' of the envelope to an evolutionary effect , or is it determined by other factors ?",
    "the absence of a correlation of the above indicators with luminosity or mass of the source argues against them being the sole controlling factor . the only significant trend is found with the ratio of envelope mass over stellar mass .",
    "the physical interpretation of such a relation would be that with time , the envelope is dispersed by the star , resulting in a higher temperature throughout the envelope .",
    "the results discussed here suggest that the observed chemical abundance and temperature variations can indeed be used to trace the evolution of the sources , and that , as in the case of low- and intermediate - mass stars , the dispersion of the envelope plays a crucial role .",
    "the combination of infrared and submillimeter diagnostics is very important in the analysis .",
    "an important next step would be to use these diagnostics to probe a much wider range of evolutionary stages for high - mass stars , especially in the hot core and ( ultra-)compact h ii region stages , to develop a more complete scenario of high - mass star formation .",
    "the relation between the inner warm envelope and the ` hot core ' is still uncertain : several objects have been observed which clearly have hot gas and evaporated ices ( including ch@xmath17oh ) in their inner regions , but which do not show the typical crowded ` hot core ' submillimeter spectra .",
    "are these objects just on their way to the ` hot core ' chemical phase ? or is the ` hot core ' a separate physical component , e.g. , a dense shell at the edge of the expanding hyper - compact h  ii region due to the pressure from the ionized gas , which is still too small to be picked up by the single - dish beams ? in either case , time or evolution plays a role and would constrain the ages of the infrared - bright sources to less than a few @xmath68 yr since evaporation .",

    ".    an important difference between high- and low - mass objects may be the mechanism for the heating and dispersion of their envelopes . for low - mass ysos , entrainment of material in outflows",
    "is the dominant process ( lada 1999 ) . for intermediate - mass stars ,",
    "outflows are important in the early phase , but ultraviolet radiation becomes dominant in the later stages ( see   3 ) .",
    "the situation for high - mass stars is still unclear .",
    "the systematic increase in gas / solid ratios and gas - phase abundances point to global heating of the gas and dust , consistent with a radiative mechanism .",
    "however , a clear chemical signature of ultraviolet radiation on gas - phase species and ices in the embedded phase has not yet been identified , making it difficult to calibrate its effect . on the other hand ,",
    "high - mass stars are known to have powerful outflows and winds , but a quantitative comparison between their effectiveness in heating an extended part of the envelope and removing material is still lacking .",
    "geometrical effects are more important in less embedded systems , as is the case for low - mass stars , where the circumstellar disk may shield part of the envelope from heating ( boogert et al .",
    ".    to what extent does the chemical evolution picture also apply to low - mass stars ?",
    "many of the chemical processes and characteristics listed in table  1 are also known to occur for low - mass ysos , but several important diagnostic tools are still lacking .",
    "in particular , sensitive mid - infrared spectroscopy is urgently needed to trace the evolution of the ices for low - mass ysos and determine gas / solid ratios . also , molecules as complex as ch@xmath17och@xmath17 and c@xmath10h@xmath19cn have not yet been detected toward low - mass ysos , although the limits are not very stringent ( e.g. , van dishoeck et al .",
    "evaporation of ices clearly occurs in low - mass environments as evidenced by enhanced abundances of grain - surface molecules in shocks ( e.g. , bachiller & prez - gutirrez 1997 ) , but whether a similar ` hot core ' chemistry ensues is not yet known . differences in the h / h@xmath10 ratio and temperature structure in the ( pre-)collapse phase may affect the grain - surface chemistry and the ice composition , leading to different abundances of solid ch@xmath17oh , which is an essential ingredient for building complex molecules .",
    "future instrumentation with high spatial resolution ( @xmath69 ) and high sensitivity will be essential to make progress in our understanding of the earliest phase of massive star formation , in particular the sma and alma at submillimeter wavelengths , and sirtf , sofia , first and ultimately ngst at mid- and far - infrared wavelengths .",

    "can you give us your personal view on the evolutionary differences of these sources ?",
    ".  van dishoeck van der tak et al .",
    "( 2000a ) argue that the infrared - bright objects such as w  3 irs5 represent an earlier evolutionary phase than the hot cores , on the basis of an anti - correlation with the radio continuum .",
    "the physical picture is that the ionizing uv radiation and stellar winds push the hottest dust in the inner regions further out , decreasing the temperature of the dust and thus the near - infrared continuum . at the same time",
    ", the size of the region which can be ionized is increased .",
    "the ` erosion ' of the envelopes thus occurs from the inside out . for other sources ,",
    "infrared diagnostics are lacking , so that the situation is less clear .",
    "it would be great if chemistry could help to tie down the time scales of the various phases .",
    "van dishoeck the absence of pah features in the early embedded stage can be due either to a lack of ultraviolet radiation to excite the features or to an absence of the carriers .",
    "manske & henning ( 1999 , a&a 349 , 907 ) have argued for the case of herbig ae / be stars that there should be sufficient radiation to excite pahs in the envelope / disk system , so that the lack is likely due to the absence of the pahs themselves .",
    "perhaps the pahs have accreted into the icy mantles at the high densities in the inner envelope and do not evaporate and/or are chemically transformed into other more refractory species on grains . alternatively , the region producing ultraviolet radiation ( h  ii region ) may be very small in these massive objects , and the photons may not reach the pah - rich material or have a very small beam filling factor .",
    "once the envelope breaks up and ultraviolet radiation can escape to the less dense outer envelope , the pah features from those regions will appear in spectra taken with large beams .",
    "van dishoeck the ` xcn ' feature is indeed the best candidate for tracing the ultraviolet processing of ices . if ascribed to ocn@xmath70 , it likely involves hnco as a precursor . in the laboratory",
    ", hnco is produced by photochemical reactions of co and nh@xmath17 , but in the interstellar medium grain surface chemistry is an alternative possibility which does not necessarily involve ultraviolet radiation ( see ehrenfreund & schutte , this volume ) .",
    "van dishoeck charnley & kaufman ( 2000 , apj , 529 , l111 ) argue that the evaporated co@xmath10 is destroyed by reactions with atomic hydrogen at high temperatures in shocks .",
    "this is an interesting suggestion , but needs to be tested against other species such as h@xmath10o and h@xmath10s which can be destroyed by reactions with atomic hydrogen as well .",
    "also , the amount of material in the envelope that can be affected by shocks is not clear ."
