    "extended objects of the non - perturbative sector of string theory , the so - called d - branes@xcite , appear to be a promising framework for model building . intersecting d - branes in particular , can provide chiral fermions and gauge symmetries which contain the standard model spectrum and the @xmath12 symmetry as a subgroup and thus d - brane models appear to be natural candidates for phenomenological explorations . during the last years , particular supersymmetric or non - supersymmetric models have been proposed  @xcite-@xcite , based on various d - brane configurations , which exhibit a number of interesting properties .",
    "a remarkable feature is that a low unification scale can be possible , since the four - dimensional gauge couplings depend on the volume of extra dimensions . in this case",
    ", one can solve the hierarchy problem without supersymmetry .",
    "further , there exist anomalous @xmath2 symmetries whose anomalies are cancelled by a generalized green - schwarz mechanism ; a linear combination of these @xmath2 s remains anomaly free and plays a significant role in particular phenomenological explorations .    in the present work ,",
    "we propose a model based on the gauge symmetry @xmath5 which can arise in a d - brane construction .",
    "this symmetry contains as a subgroup the @xmath13 symmetry , ( trinification model ) which has been proposed long time ago  @xcite and subsequently explored in a non - supersymmetric  @xcite , or supersymmetric  @xcite-@xcite context .",
    "it has also been explored as a subgroup of the @xmath14 symmetry in field theory@xcite or in the context of strings  @xcite . in this paper , we restrict to the non - supersymmetric case , as the problem of supersymmetry breaking may be resolved at the d - brane level  @xcite .    in the d - brane analogue of the trinification model",
    "all fermions are accommodated in the @xmath15 representations charged under three additional anomalous @xmath2 s .",
    "one linear combination of these @xmath2 symmetries -hereafter @xmath16- is anomaly free and can serve as a hypercharge component , leading to very interesting phenomenological implications .",
    "two higgs fields @xmath17 in the representation @xmath18 ( which is the same one accommodating the lepton fields ) are needed to break the original symmetry down to the sm . in the d - brane construction , in addition , two higgs fields @xmath19 and @xmath20 may also appear in the spectrum .",
    "when these higgs fields obtain vevs , they break @xmath16 and at the same time provide heavy masses to a pair of the extra lepton doublets .",
    "quark masses arise from tree - level couplings of the yukawa potential .",
    "the same coupling supports with a heavy mass an extra color triplet . due to the additional @xmath2 symmetries ,",
    "yukawa couplings for leptons are not allowed at tree - level , however , they arise already at fourth order giving thus a natural explanation to quark - lepton hierarchy . further , higher order invariants for yukawa mass terms appear at even powers of the expansion parameter @xmath21 , ( where @xmath22 is the string scale ) ensuring thus the validity of the perturbation theory in this model .",
    "the @xmath23 model retains also all the interesting features of the trinification model . among them ,",
    "the higgs doublets and colored fields are in different representations , therefore , no doublet - triplet splitting is required .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a description of the @xmath23 model motivated by d - brane scenarios and present the fermion and higgs spectrum .",
    "we discuss the mixed anomaly cancellation and we identify the anomaly - free @xmath2 combination which contributes to the hypercharge generator .",
    "we further discuss the gauge coupling evolution and determine the range of the string scale as well as the @xmath24 intermediate breaking scale . in section 3",
    "we calculate the yukawa potential and show that a quark - lepton hierarchy arises , while all extra colored triplets and doublets become massive at a high scale .",
    "we also discuss the implications of the model for the neutrino masses . in section 4",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "the model proposed here can be considered as a d - brane analogue of the trinification @xmath25 model proposed in @xcite . the minimal gauge symmetry obtained from d - branes which has as a subgroup the @xmath1 model is @xmath23 . without going into details ,",
    "we give here a brief description how such a symmetry could arise in the context as a d - brane construction .",
    "the basic ingredient is the brane stack , i.e. , a certain number of parallel , almost coincident d - branes .",
    "a single d - brane carries a @xmath2 gauge symmetry which is the result of the reduction of the ten - dimensional yang - mills theory .",
    "a stack of @xmath26 parallel branes gives rise to a @xmath27 gauge group .",
    "we thus consider three stacks of d - branes , each stack containing 3 parallel almost coincident branes giving rise to the gauge symmetry @xmath28 the first @xmath29 is related to @xmath30 color , the second involves the weak @xmath31 and the third is related to a possible intermediate @xmath32 gauge group . since @xmath29 is equivalent to @xmath33 our d - brane construction contains also three extra @xmath2 abelian symmetries .",
    "the @xmath34 symmetry obtained from the color @xmath35 is related to the baryon number  @xcite which survives at low energies as a global symmetry .",
    "there are two additional abelian factors originating from @xmath36 , @xmath37 so the @xmath23 symmetry can be equivalently written su(3)_csu(3)_lsu(3)_ru(1)_cu(1)_lu(1)_r[333111 ]     d - brane configuration and the matter fields of the model . ]    in the d - brane context , matter fields appear as open strings having both their ends attached to some of the brane stacks .",
    "for example , strings with both ends attached on two different 3-brane stacks belong to the @xmath38 multiplets of the corresponding gauge group factors .",
    "the possible representations which arise in this scenario should be appropriate to accommodate the standard model particles and higgs fields .",
    "as such candidates we choose the open strings that appear in figure [ u333 ] . under the decomposition ( [ 333111 ] ) these lead to the following matter representations & = & ( 3,|3,1)_(+1,-1,0)[ql ] + q^c&=&(|3,1,3)_(-1,0,+1)[qr ] + l^&=&(1,3,|3)_(0,+1,-1)[lh ] we adopt a notation where the three first numbers refer to the color , left and right @xmath30 gauge groups , while the three indices correspond to the three @xmath39 symmetries respectively .",
    "it turns out that these three representations are sufficient to accommodate all the fermions of the standard model .",
    "in particular , the representation ( [ ql ] ) includes the quark left handed doublets and an additional colored triplet with quantum numbers as those of the down quark , while representation ( [ qr ] ) contains the right - handed partners of ( [ ql ] ) . finally ( [ lh ] ) involves the lepton doublet , the right - handed electron and its corresponding neutrino , two additional @xmath31 doublets and another neutral state , called neutreto@xcite . for a single family , we write the following assignment ( 3,|3,1)= (    ccc u_r&d_r&g_r + u_g&d_g&g_g + u_b&d_b&g_b    ) , ( |3,1,3)= (    ccc u^c_r&u^c_g&u^c_b + d^c_r&d^c_g&d^c_b + g^c_r&g^c_g&g^c_b    ) , ( 1,3,|3)= (    ccc e^c0&e^-&e + e^c+&e^0 & + e^c&^c+&^c-    ) .[familas ] in addition , ( [ lh ] ) may also accommodate the higgs multiplets responsible for the symmetry breaking down to the standard model _ a & = & ( 1,3,|3)_(0,+1,-1 ) according to  @xcite , two higgs replicas ( @xmath40 ) are required in order to obtain both symmetry breaking to sm and non - trivial quark mixing",
