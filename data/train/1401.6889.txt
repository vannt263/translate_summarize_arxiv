    "<S> ( [ plz ] ) should be modified under the experimental conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> now the question is why the oscillation amplitude of the experimental result is significantly smaller than that of the numerical ( analytical ) results while they have the same oscillatory dependence of @xmath55 on the geometric phase @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> as demonstrated below , the quantitative discrepancy between the experiment and calculations is due to energy relaxation and decoherence . because @xmath59 and @xmath60 of the qubit are comparable to @xmath101 , the effect of qubit decoherence can not be ignored . in order to have a meaningful comparison between the experiment and theory </S>",
    "<S> , we take the effects of finite @xmath59 and @xmath60 into consideration by numerically solving the master equation . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum dynamics of the system is thus described by the master equation of the time evolution of the density matrix @xmath102 : @xmath103-\\gamma \\lbrack \\rho ] , \\label{mastereq}\\]]where the system hamiltonian @xmath21 is given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hb ] ) , and the second term , @xmath104 $ ] , describes the relaxation and dephasing processes phenomenologically . in a concrete expression , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mastereq ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath105-\\gamma _ { 1}\\rho _ { 11},$ ] @xmath106-\\gamma \\rho _ { 10},$ ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath107 with @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .    the result obtained by solving the master equation without decoherence is identical to that obtained by numerically solving the schrdinger equation . furthermore , the simulated result using the measured qubit @xmath111 ns and @xmath112 ns , shown as the blue solid line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) , agrees fairly well with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ plz ] ) , we know that by adjusting the sweeping speed of the flux bias @xmath113 , one could change the transition probability @xmath114 however , since the geometric phase does not depend on @xmath82 , the period and phase of @xmath115 oscillation should be insensitive to changes in @xmath2 [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(c ) ] . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) , we show the measured @xmath115 oscillation for the different lzi sweeping time @xmath116 which agrees quite well with the numerical results . moreover , unlike the lz interference of accumulated dynamical phases , @xmath55 does not oscillate with @xmath35 , indicating that the dynamical phase is well eliminated by the spin - echo pulse .    finally , we compare the performance of the geometric lz interference with that of the conventional dynamical lz interference . </S>",
    "<S> the measured @xmath55 as a function of the cyclic time @xmath101 for @xmath117 ns is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(d ) . for dynamical lz interferometry , the temporal profiles of the flux bias and mw fields are the same as those depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) , except that no @xmath71 pulse is applied at point @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the phase angle @xmath118 of the microwave is kept constant , while @xmath119 is varied by changing the time spent in the plateau part of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to that of the geometric lz interference , @xmath55 oscillates notably when @xmath101 is varied . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , for the similar range of time @xmath120 ns , the contrast ( defined as the difference between the maximum and the minimum amplitudes of the oscillation ) of the dynamical lz interference is about 0.16 , which is much weaker than the corresponding value of 0.4 for the geometric lz interference . because @xmath121 @xcite is also the theoretical prediction for the contrast of dynamical lz interferences , this result demonstrates that the geometric phase is more robust and stable against a variety of error - causing dynamical processes such as those caused by microscopic two - level systems coupled to the qubit @xcite .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have experimentally demonstrated glzi in a superconducting qubit . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that glzi may have advantages in many applications involving quantum state manipulation @xcite such as simulating the time - reversal symmetry with lz interferometry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since our geometric lz approach combines the simplicity of lz interferometry and the robustness of geometric phases for quantum state manipulation , it may very well open a new venue for fault - tolerant quantum information processing .    </S>",
