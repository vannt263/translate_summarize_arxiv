    "persistent charge current in a mesoscopic metal ring was predicted@xcite and observed@xcite a decade ago .",
    "in such a ring threaded by a magnetic flux , if the phase coherence length of electrons is larger than the size of the ring , then the electrons can pick up an aharonov - bohm ( ab ) phase after circling the ring once .",
    "such a phase lag ( or advance ) would lead to a persistent current , which is a periodic function of the threaded magnetic flux,@xcite and can be detected via the magnetic response of the ( isolated ) ring .",
    "the phase lag ( or advance ) can also be of geometric origin ( berry phase).@xcite it has been proposed that a berry phase can appear for an electron moving around the metal ring that subject to a textured magnetic field ( or magnetization).@xcite this geometric phase , which depends upon the solid angle associated with the textured magnetic field , can lead to persistent charge and spin currents.@xcite a similar geometric phase appears due to the spin - orbit interaction in one - dimensional rings,@xcite which is a manifestation of the aharonov - casher ( ac ) effect.@xcite more studies on the persistent current related to the ac effect can be found in refs .  .    with the advance of spintronics and quantum computation,@xcite",
    "it becomes more important to understand the behavior of the spin current . among these investigations ,",
    "spin transport in pure spin systems plays a special role since there is no complication from charge degrees of freedom . in a recent paper , using a semiclassical spin wave analysis , schtz _ et al .",
    "_ predicted the existence of persistent spin current in a mesoscopic ferromagnetic ( fm ) spin ring in a _",
    "magnetic field.@xcite the fm spin ring being considered is a charge insulator with heisenberg spin interaction , and the spin current is carried by magnon excitations .",
    "similar to the case of charge transport in a metal ring subject to a textured magnetic field,@xcite the magnon in a mesoscopic fm spin ring acquires a geometric phase from the ( nonuniform ) spin texture of the classical ground state .",
    "the persistent current is found to be zero at temperature @xmath1 , and proportional to @xmath0 when @xmath2 is larger than the field - induced energy gap of the magnons .",
    "similar method has been applied to an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) spin ring with a haldane gap.@xcite as compared with the fm case , there are some subtleties in using the semiclassical method in the afm case . due to the problem of infrared - diverging magnetization ,",
    "the spin - wave approach is not valid for afm spin chains with half - integer spins.@xcite that is the reason why only the integer - spin cases are considered in ref .  .",
    "nonetheless , in the integer - spin case , an additional staggered field in the direction of the classical magnetization vectors still has to be introduced .",
    "its value needs to be determined self - consistently before quantitative predictions can be made .",
    "the authors of ref .   find that , unlike the case of the fm spin ring , the persistent spin current in an afm spin ring can be nonzero at @xmath1 due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "when the spin correlation length is much longer than the size of the ring , the magnitude of the spin current exhibits sawtooth variation with respect to the geometric phase , similar to the case of persistent charge current in a metal ring .",
    "recently , the investigation has been extended to an anisotropic fm spin ring,@xcite a spin-1/2 afm spin ring,@xcite and an anisotropic afm spin ring.@xcite    in this paper , we study the persistent spin current in a ferrimagnetic ( fim ) spin ring with alternating spins @xmath3 and @xmath4 under a textured magnetic field .",
    "contrary to the afm case , the problem of infrared - diverging magnetization does not exist in the present fim case , no matter whether the constituent spins are integer or half - integer.@xcite thus the self - consistently determined staggered field needs not be introduced , and physical quantities can be calculated directly as long as system parameters are known .",
    "we find that the fim spin ring can have either fm or afm characteristics .",
    "for example , a quantity proportional to @xmath5 plays a role similar to the haldane gap in the afm spin ring .",
    "moreover , a nonzero spin current exists at @xmath1 , again similar to the case of the afm spin ring.@xcite on the other hand , when the thermal energy is higher than the field - induced gap , the magnitude of the spin current is proportional to temperature @xmath0 , similar to the case in the fm spin ring.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows : we present the spin - wave analysis in sec .",
