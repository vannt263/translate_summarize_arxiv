    "we study resolutions over the polynomial ring @xmath0 $ ] , where @xmath3 is a field .",
    "the idea to encode the structure of the resolution of a monomial ideal in the combinatorial structure of a simplicial complex was introduced in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the idea was generalized later in @xcite , where resolutions supported on a * _ regular _ * cell complex were introduced .",
    "the generalization continued in @xcite and @xcite , where monomial resolutions supported on a cw - complex were introduced and studied .",
    "recently , the necessity for cw - resolutions is justified in @xcite , and their sufficiency is disproved by the existence of a monomial ideal whose resolution can not be supported on a cw - complex .",
    "in this paper we study borel fixed ideals generated in the same degree @xmath4 , which we call @xmath4-generated . for @xmath4-generated borel fixed ideals a minimal free resolution is already well known , namely the eliahou - kervaire resolution ( see , e.g. @xcite or @xcite ) , which is also cw - cellular , as it is proved in @xcite by using discrete morse theory .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , the authors give the morse complex that supports a minimal free resolution for powers of the homogeneous maximal ideal @xmath5 of the polynomial ring @xmath0 $ ] as a worked example .",
    "more generally , the morse complex that supports a minimal free resolution of principal borel fixed ideals , that is , of those ideals which are minimally generated ( in the borel sense ) by just one monomial , is given in @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear whether any of those morse complexes is regular or not .",
    "thus , a natural question is whether there exists a * _ regular _ * cell complex that supports a minimal resolution of a @xmath4-generated borel fixed ideal .",
    "we answer the question positively in this paper , which is organized as follows :    in section 2 , we give the basic notation and preliminaries for the rest of this paper and we refer to the literature for more details .    in section 3 , we answer the above natural question by constructing inductively a shellable polyhedral cell complex that supports the minimal free resolution of a principal borel fixed ideal in @xmath0 $ ] ; this includes the case of powers of the homogeneous maximal ideal as a special case .",
    "our most general result is theorem [ p3:cr ] , where we prove that for any @xmath4-generated borel fixed ideal @xmath2 , there exists a polyhedral cell complex that supports a minimal free resolution of @xmath2 .",
    "it should be noted that the basis we use in the minimal free resolution is different than the one used in the elliahou - kervaire resolution .",
