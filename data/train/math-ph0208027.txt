    "in the present article we study the occurrence of discontinuities in the integrated density of states ( ids ) . for the special case of a tight binding model associated with the penrose tiling the occurrence of this effect has been known since quite some time as witnessed for example in @xcite .",
    "we present two results .",
    "the first aims at showing that the occurrence of jumps in the ids can not be excluded by global assumptions concerning , e.g. ergodic or combinatorial properties . to this end",
    "we present a theorem saying that starting from some model of aperiodic order ( phrased in the language of delone sets ) one can construct a model that is `` basically the same '' and gives rise to a tight binding operator with a discontinuity in the ids .",
    "here `` basically the same '' is cast in the notion of `` mutually locally derivable '' for delone dynamical systems .",
    "we discuss this notion analogous to the respective notion for tilings found in @xcite . in the construction",
    "we use that the laplacians on certain graphs have finitely supported eigenfunctions .",
    "it now becomes clear that it is the more complex structure of graphs in higher dimension that makes such a phenomenon possible .",
    "on lattices ( and , consequently , in one - dimensional systems ) such finitely supported eigenfunctions can not occur .",
    "our second theorem says that this is the only possibility to create a jump of the ids , at least when starting from a reasonable delone dynamical system .",
    "it is a consequence of a rather strong ergodic theorem in @xcite .",
    "this theorem states that the ids is in fact the uniform limit of eigenvalue counting distributions .",
    "it is therefore substantially stronger than the weak convergence results typically proven in connection with the ids see for example @xcite .",
    "the fact that such a strong convergence holds true is special for models of aperiodic order and not met in usual random systems .",
    "in this section we introduce some notation and present our results .",
    "we will use the same setting as the one found @xcite . for completeness reasons",
    "we include the necessary definitions .",
    "let @xmath3 a fixed integer and all delone sets , patterns etc",
    ". will be subsets of @xmath4 .",
    "the euclidean norm on @xmath4 will be denoted by @xmath5 . for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , we let @xmath8 be the closed ball in @xmath4 centered at @xmath9 with radius @xmath10 .    a subset @xmath11 of @xmath4 is called delone set if there exist @xmath12 and @xmath13 such that @xmath14 whenever @xmath15 with @xmath16 , and @xmath17 for all @xmath18 .",
    "we are dealing in this paper with local structures of delone sets , therefore the restrictions of @xmath11 to bounded subsets of @xmath4 are of particular interest . in order to treat these restrictions , we introduce the following definition .",
    "\\(a ) a pair @xmath19 consisting of a bounded subset @xmath20 of @xmath4 and @xmath21 finite is called pattern .",
    "the set @xmath20 is called the support of the pattern .",
    "+ ( b ) a pattern @xmath19 is called a ball pattern if @xmath22 with @xmath23 for suitable @xmath18 and @xmath24 .",
    "the diameter and the volume of a pattern are defined to be the diameter and the volume of its support respectively .",
    "we will have to identify patterns which are equal up to translation .",
    "more precisely , on the set of patterns we introduce an equivalence relation by setting @xmath25 if and only if there exists a @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the class of a pattern @xmath19 is then denoted by @xmath29 $ ] . obviously the notions of diameter , volume occurrence etc . can easily be carried over from patterns to pattern classes .",
    "every delone set @xmath11 gives rise to a set of pattern classes , @xmath30 , and to a set of ball pattern classes @xmath31 : p\\in    \\omega , r\\in { { \\mathbb r}}^+ \\}$ ] .",
    "here we set @xmath32 .",
    "we define the radius @xmath33 of an arbitrary ball pattern @xmath34 to be the radius of the underlying ball . for @xmath35 , we denote by @xmath36 the set of ball patterns with radius @xmath37 .",
    "a delone set is said to be of _ finite type _ or of _ finite local complexity _ if for every radius @xmath38 the set @xmath36 is finite .",
    "the hausdorff metric on the set of compact subsets of @xmath4 induces the so called _ natural topology _ on the set of closed subsets of @xmath4 .",
    "it is described in detail in @xcite and shares some nice properties : firstly , the set of all closed subsets of @xmath4 is compact in the natural topology . secondly , and",
    "this is of prime importance in view of the dynamical system we are to consider , the natural action @xmath39 of @xmath4 on the closed sets in @xmath4 given by @xmath40 is continuous .",
    "furthermore , a _ delone dynamical system ( dds ) _ consists of a set @xmath41 of delone sets , which is invariant under the shift @xmath39 and closed in the natural topology .",
    "a dds is said to be of finite type ( ddsf ) if @xmath42 is finite for every @xmath37 and the set @xmath43 of patterns classes associated to a dds @xmath41 is defined by @xmath44 . due to the compactness of the set of all closed sets in the natural topology a dds @xmath41 is compact .",
    "we refrain from a precise discussion of the topology but we give the following lemma from @xcite .",
    "[ topology ] if @xmath45 is a ddsf then a sequence @xmath46 converges to @xmath11 in the natural topology if and only if there exists a sequence @xmath47 converging to @xmath48 such that for every @xmath49 there is an @xmath50 with @xmath51 for @xmath52 .    roughly speaking , @xmath11 is close to @xmath53 if @xmath11 equals @xmath53 on a large ball up to a small translation .",
    "we now recall some standard notions from the theory of dynamical systems and some available equivalent `` combinatorial '' characterizations .",
    "a dynamical system @xmath45 is called _ minimal _ if the orbit @xmath54 of any @xmath11 is dense in @xmath41 . for a dds",
    "this is equivalent to the property that @xmath55 for any @xmath11 .",
    "this latter property is called _ local isomorphism property _ in the tiling framework ; see @xcite .",
    "a sequence @xmath56 of subsets in @xmath4 is called a van hove sequence if the sequence @xmath57 tends to zero for every @xmath58 . here",
    ", @xmath59 denotes the set of those @xmath18 whose distance to the boundary of @xmath20 is less than @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , a dynamical system @xmath45 is called _ uniquely ergodic _ if it admits only one @xmath39-invariant measure ( up to normalization ) . for a delone dynamical system , this is equivalent to the fact , that for every nonempty pattern class @xmath34 the frequency @xmath61 exists uniformly in @xmath62 for every van hove sequence @xmath56 .",
    "we call a dynamical system @xmath45 _ strictly ergodic _ if it is minimal and uniquely ergodic .",
    "note that in this case the frequency @xmath63 is positive for every @xmath64    let @xmath45 be a ddsf .",
    "a family @xmath65 of bounded operators @xmath66 is called a random operator of finite range if there exists a constant @xmath67 with    * @xmath68 whenever @xmath69 .",
    "* @xmath70 only depends on the pattern class @xmath71 .",
    "note that the above defined operators provide a framework including laplace type operators defined on @xmath72 .",
    "let us mention , that for @xmath73 the operators act on different hilbert spaces @xmath74 and @xmath75 unless @xmath11 and @xmath53 differ only by translation .",
    "thus , to deal with operators on @xmath74 is more complicated than in the lattice case .",
    "the aim of this article is to discuss the phenomenon of discontinuities of the integrated density of states of random operators @xmath65 on a ddsf @xmath45 .",
    "this might rather come as a surprise in view of what is known for random models as well one dimensional quasicrystals .",
    "it turns out that this phenomenon occurs if and only if there exist locally supported eigenfunctions of @xmath65 .",
    "one can find examples of locally supported eigenfunctions on the penrose tiling in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an eigenfunction @xmath76 is said to be locally supported if @xmath77 , with @xmath78 a compact set .",
    "the phenomenon of locally supported eigenfunctions is by no means pathological . rather from any given ddsf @xmath45",
    "we can construct an in some sense local equivalent ddsf @xmath79 such that a random operator of finite range @xmath80 defined on @xmath79 has locally supported eigenfunctions .",
    "more precise : @xmath45 and @xmath79 are _ mutually locally derivable _ ( mld ) .",
    "the equivalence concept of mutual local derivability for tilings was discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "this will all be discussed below .",
    "our first result reads as follows .",
    "[ mld ] let @xmath45 be a arbitrary ddsf .",
    "then there exists a ddfs @xmath79 and a random operator of finite range @xmath81 such that @xmath45 and @xmath79 are mutually locally derivable and @xmath81 has locally supported eigenfunctions with eigenvalue @xmath82 for every @xmath83 . moreover , @xmath81 can be chosen to be the nearest neighbor laplacian of suitable graph .",
    "note that for a selfadjoint random operator @xmath84 and bounded @xmath85 the restriction @xmath86 defined on @xmath87 has finite rank .",
    "therefore , the spectral counting function @xmath88 is finite and @xmath89 is the distribution function of the measure @xmath90 , defined by @xmath91    on a uniquely ergodic ddsf the measures @xmath92 converge in distribution to a measure @xmath93 , called the integrated density of states ( ids ) for any van hove sequence @xmath94 as @xmath95 .",
    "this is described in @xcite .",
    "there one can also find an interpretation of the ids as a certain trace on a von neumann algebra .",
    "now , we can state our main theorem .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath45 be a strictly ergodic ddsf",
    ". let @xmath84 be a selfajoint random operator of finite range .",
    "then @xmath82 is a point of discontinuity of @xmath93 if and only if there exists a locally supported eigenfunction of @xmath96 to @xmath82 for one ( all ) @xmath62 .    * it rather straightforward to see that locally supported eigenfunctions lead to a discontinuity of the ids .",
    "the more interesting part of the equivalence is discontinuities only happen in that way . *",
    "the theorem holds also in the tiling setting . here a single tile of the original tiling will be replaced by 9 tiles of a new tiling which is mld to the originally given one . *",
    "as pointed out already the theorem gives rise to a complete characterization of the phenomenon of locally supported eigenfunctions in quasicrystal settings ( i.e. ddsf an tiling settings ) .",
    "* let us emphasize that the integrated density of states is continuous in the case of almost periodic and random operators on lattices .",
    "due to the more complex geometry this does not follow in the quasicrystal framework .",
    "in this section we will study the equivalence concept of mld .",
    "further we are going to construct a map , which maps any given ddsf to a ddsf which is mld to the given one and where a random operator exists who has locally supported eigenfunctions .",
    "as well we state some tools which will be used later on to prove our results .    as mentioned already the equivalence concept of mld for patterns on tilings",
    "was discussed in @xcite .",
    "we give the obvious definition for delone dynamical systems of finite type .",
    "let @xmath45 and @xmath79 a ddsf .",
    "a map @xmath97 is called a local derivation map if there exists a radius @xmath98 such that @xmath99 holds whenever @xmath100 . in this case",
    "@xmath79 is called locally derivable from @xmath45 .",
    "two ddsf @xmath45 and @xmath79 are _ mutually locally derivable _",
    "if @xmath45 is locally derivable from @xmath79 and vice versa ( with a possibly different radius @xmath101 ) .",
    "note that the map @xmath102 is local in the sense that @xmath103 only depends on @xmath104 .",
    "let @xmath45 be a ddsf , @xmath97 , @xmath105 a local derivation map .",
    "then @xmath102 is continuous with respect to the natural topology .",
    "_ this is immediate as @xmath102 is local and the topology is local in the sense of lemma [ topology ] .",
    "what we want to do now is to put a well scaled local structure in a given delone set whenever a certain pattern occurs .",
    "let @xmath11 be a delone set and @xmath34 be a ball pattern class with @xmath64 .",
    "then , we define @xmath106 to be the set of all occurrences of @xmath34 in @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath107    now , let @xmath45 be a ddsf and @xmath108 for all @xmath62 , @xmath109 be a finite graph with @xmath110 the set of vertices of @xmath109 contained in @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore let @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "we use this finite graph to define a local derivation map by setting @xmath113 for @xmath114 and @xmath115 then , @xmath116 is a local derivation with inverse given by the local derivation map @xmath117 note that @xmath45 is also a local derivation of @xmath79 .",
    "thus , @xmath45 and @xmath79 are mutually locally derivable .",
    "let @xmath41 and @xmath118 be as above .",
    "then    * if @xmath45 is a ddsf then @xmath79 is a ddsf as well . * if @xmath45 is a uniquely ergodic ddsf , the same holds for @xmath79 . *",
    "the frequency of @xmath109 in @xmath118 is the same as the frequency @xmath63 of @xmath34 in @xmath41 .",
    "the following two ingredients are essential for the proof of theorem [ main ] .",
    "the first one is one of the main results from @xcite .",
    "it relies on a strong ergodic type theorem proven there ( see @xcite for a study of uniform ergodic theorems in the one dimensional case ) .",
    "[ ids ] let @xmath45 be an aperiodic strictly ergodic ddsf .",
    "let @xmath84 be a selfadjoint operator of finite type and @xmath56 be a van hove sequence in @xmath4 .",
    "then , the distribution functions of @xmath119 converge uniformly to the distribution function of the measure @xmath93 and this convergence is uniform in @xmath120 .",
    "the second one is a well known dimension argument from linear algebra which we will state for completeness reasons .",
    "[ dim ] let @xmath121 be a finite dimensional hilbert space , @xmath122 subspaces of @xmath121 with @xmath123 then @xmath124 .",
    "in this section we prove theorem [ mld ] and theorem [ main ] .",
    "_ proof of theorem [ mld ] . _ to prove the theorem we start with the construction of a ddsf where a random operator of finite range @xmath65 exists which has locally supported eigenfunctions .",
    "the starting point is a small graph @xmath125 and an eigenfunction @xmath126 of the associated nearest neighbor laplacian",
    ". for definiteness sake consider figure 1 .",
    "the values of @xmath126 are indicated near the corresponding vertices .",
    "here the eigenvalue is @xmath127 .",
    "it is clear that whatever edges reach out of the four corners in a larger graph extending @xmath128 , the extension of @xmath126 by @xmath48 to the larger vertex set will still constitute an eigenfunction of the laplacian on the large graph .",
    "it is now easy to implement this picture into a given ddsf .",
    "in fact , let @xmath45 be a ddsf and @xmath34 be a ball pattern .",
    "we use the local derivation map @xmath129 discussed in the last section to put in @xmath130 from above , scaled properly , whenever @xmath34 appears .",
    "it is obvious by the definition of @xmath129 , that this gives rise to a ddsf @xmath79 which is locally derivable from @xmath45 and vice versa .",
    "obviously we get a random operator @xmath131 with locally supported eigenfunctions by taking for @xmath132 the nearest neighbor laplacian on the copies of @xmath133 in @xmath11 and consistent matrix elements otherwise .",
    "* the simplest case of the construction made above is of course given by choosing @xmath134 with @xmath135 .",
    "then the graph @xmath128 is glued at any point of the underlying delone set .",
    "the corresponding @xmath136 space is just a direct sum ( or tensor product ) and that applies to the operators as well .",
    "related constructions have been considered by @xcite in the context of creation of spectral gaps . * for those who prefer tiling examples we now indicate how to view the construction above in this framework . take a tiling dynamical system ( see @xcite ) and replace one given tile @xmath39 by a suitable homeomorphic image of @xmath137 indicated in figure [ fig.2 ] .",
    "we also indicated the next neighbor relations , showing that the resulting graph is just @xmath128 above .",
    "_ proof of theorem [ main ] .",
    "_ we first show that the condition is sufficient .",
    "let @xmath138 be an eigenfunction of @xmath139 associated to an eigenvalue @xmath82 with @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "then for any @xmath62 every copy of @xmath142 in @xmath143 adds a dimension to the eigenspace of @xmath144 belonging to the eigenvalue @xmath82 .",
    "let @xmath145 be the maximal number of disjoint copies of @xmath34 in @xmath143 .",
    "note that @xmath146 is a upper bound for the number of points ( and therefore the maximal number of copies of @xmath34 ) in @xmath147 .",
    "thus , for arbitrary @xmath149 @xmath150 setting @xmath151 with @xmath94 from a van hove sequence and letting @xmath152 tend to infinity , we get that @xmath153 . as @xmath149 is arbitrary and @xmath154 the desired implication follows .",
    "next we show the converse implication .",
    "let @xmath155 be a point of discontinuity of the function @xmath156)$ ] and @xmath56 an arbitrary van hove sequence .",
    "we consider the distribution function @xmath89 of the measure @xmath92 .",
    "proposition [ ids ] shows , that @xmath157 converges w.r.t .",
    "the supremum norm to the function @xmath158)$ ] .",
    "thus , for large @xmath152 the jump at @xmath155 of the function @xmath159 does not become small .",
    "more precisely we get @xmath160 for a @xmath161 and all @xmath162 .",
    "now let @xmath163 denote the inner boundary of range @xmath164 of @xmath94 . for a van hove sequence @xmath56",
    "we have @xmath165 with a suitable @xmath166 which tends to @xmath48 for @xmath95 .",
    "for @xmath152 large enough we get that @xmath167 .",
    "thus , for large @xmath152 the inequality @xmath168 holds . now let @xmath169 the projection onto the inner boundary of range @xmath164 of @xmath94 .",
    "then propositon [ dim ] shows that there exists an eigenfunction @xmath76 of @xmath96 such that @xmath170 for @xmath152 large enough .",
