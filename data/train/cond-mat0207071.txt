    "the effects of temperature changes currently are the most interesting in spin - glass studies . the coexistence of chaos ( or rejuvenation ) and memory @xcite is particularly puzzling .",
    "a first non - trivial problem is whether these effects are universal , i.e. whether they are present in different real spin - glasses @xcite and in numerical simulations of microscopic models @xcite ; the main problem , however , lies in the theoretical explanation of these phenomena .",
    "if one admits that the static ( equilibrium ) free - energy landscape is somehow relevant to the off - equilibrium dynamics , the two effects of chaos and memory seem to contradict each other : the former points in the direction of absence of correlation between the equilibrium states at different temperature , while the latter points in the opposite direction .",
    "a qualitative explanation of the coexistence of the two effects has been given in terms of a hierarchical picture in which states at different temperatures are organized on the same ultrametric tree , whose details are revealed by lowering the temperature @xcite . recent numerical and theoretical work on the subject has confirmed that the generalized random energy model ( grem ) @xcite , a model with such a landscape structure , displays chaos as well as memory @xcite . however , the grem is defined through its phase space , without any reference to any underlying microscopic description ; therefore it would be interesting to find out whether there are spin - glasses that behave like the grem .",
    "the question is whether equilibrium states at different temperatures are correlated or not and which is the nature of the correlations .",
    "the hypothesis of chaos in temperature affirms that they are uncorrelated in finite dimensional systems @xcite ; this has been studied analytically in a number of paper @xcite ; we have questioned the hypothesis validity in the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model in a recent paper @xcite , henceforth labeled [ i ] .",
    "the problem has also been investigated numerically @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that the random energy model ( rem ) , which is non - chaotic by definition , is capable of producing strong rejuvenation signals @xcite .",
    "on the other hand various attempts are underway to substantiate the idea of some kind of hierarchical structure underlying the phenomenology in the context of real - space theories like the droplet model @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the mean - field multi-@xmath1-spin spherical spin - glass models for values of the coupling constants such that they display full replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) @xcite .",
    "it must be remarked that the analysis of the off - equilibrium dynamics @xcite of these models has revealed the coexistence of chaos and memory @xcite .",
    "we study the correlations between the equilibrium states at different temperatures following the lines developed in [ i ] , where the problem has been put in connection with the existence of a particular class of solutions of the saddle point ( sp ) equations obtained in the replica framework . in section 1",
    "we prove that these solutions exist for the class of models considered , implying strong correlations between states at different temperatures , i.e. no chaos in temperature .",
    "these solutions are built with parisi matrices @xcite and in section 2 we show that this structure implies ultrametric relations between the overlaps of states at different temperatures .",
    "these ultrametric relations determine a one - to - one correspondence ( except at the lower levels ) between the trees of states at two different temperatures in such a way that to a cluster of states at temperature @xmath2 , at a level of the @xmath3 tree labeled by some value @xmath4 of the overlap , corresponds a cluster of states at temperature @xmath5 at a level of the @xmath6 tree labeled by the same value @xmath7 .",
    "we call  twins \" any two clusters in such a correspondence .",
    "specifically , a state at temperature @xmath2 corresponds to a cluster of states at temperature @xmath8 whose minimal overlap is given by @xmath9 .",
    "therefore each state at temperature @xmath2 can be considered as the father of many states at temperature @xmath5 .",
    "a son has only one father , and it has an overlap lower than @xmath9 with all the other states at @xmath2 .",
    "the meaning of the correspondence between the trees at different temperatures is that any relationship between a state or cluster @xmath10 at @xmath5 and any other state or cluster @xmath11 at @xmath2 or @xmath6 is univocally determined by the relationship between @xmath11 and the twin of @xmath10 at @xmath3 . in particular , given a state @xmath11 at @xmath6 and its father @xmath12 at @xmath13 ,",
    "the overlap between @xmath11 and any state @xmath14 at @xmath2 is given by @xmath15 .",
    "each state of a spin - glass system at a given temperature has a certain statistical weight @xmath16 determined by the gibbs measure . according to the parisi solution @xcite the fluctuations of the weights with the disorder",
    "can be described through a stochastic process involving the free energies @xmath17 of the states , which are defined as @xmath18/\\sum _",
    "{ k}\\exp [ -\\beta f_{k } ] $ ] @xcite .",
    "given the tree of states , one considers a given level @xmath19 and assigns independently to each cluster of states at this level a reference free energy chosen randomly such that the average number of clusters with free energy between @xmath20 and @xmath21 is given by @xmath22df \\label{legge1}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the inverse of the parisi function @xmath24 .",
    "after having applied the procedure to every level of the tree , the free energy of a given state is set to be the sum of the reference free energies of the clusters to which it belongs at the various levels .",
    "for instance , if the state @xmath10 belongs to the cluster @xmath25 at the first level of the tree , to the cluster @xmath26 at the second level of the tree and so on , its free energy is given by @xmath27 the distribution obtained has various interesting features ; for instance , in each sample there are only few states with a finite weight , while there is an infinite number of states that carries an infinitesimal weight .    since we found a one - to - one correspondence between the trees of states at different temperatures , it is natural to whether if there are also correlation between the weights . in the replica framework the standard procedure to cope with this problem",
    "requires the computation of sums over all the different solutions of the saddle point equations , in order to obtain the cumulants of the distribution function of the weights . when considering a system at a given temperature ,",
    "this can be done noticing that all the solutions are permutations of the standard parisi solution @xcite ; therefore the sum over solutions can be replaced by a sum over replica indices ; unfortunately when considering systems at different temperatures the solutions are not permutations one of the other and we are unable to sum them all . however , in section 3 we conjecture that the weights distribution is identical to that of the grem class of models . in the grem",
    "the tree of states is the same at all temperatures by definition and the reference free energies of the clusters are constant too @xcite .",
    "their distribution obeys the law ( [ legge1 ] ) with @xmath28 replaced by @xmath29 , a function that depends on the model . in analogy to this we guess that in the models we are considering the reference free energy of a given cluster at @xmath3 is equal to the reference free energy of its twin at @xmath6 ; we notice that since for this models we have @xmath30 , ( where @xmath29 depends on the coupling constants but not on the temperature ) , this is consistent with the fact that the same set of free energies obeys law ( [ legge1 ] ) at all temperatures .",
    "this belief is motivated by the fact that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the solutions of sp equations of the multi-@xmath1 spin spherical model and the solutions one finds in the analogous replica treatment of the grem @xcite .",
    "indeed , the solutions have the same _ formal _ structure expressed in terms of the function @xmath31 and the differences between the models shows up only in the actual values of this function . since for every solution of the multi-@xmath0 spherical spin - glass models there is a correspondent solution of the grem , we expect that the sums over solutions give equal results in the two models ; more precisely we expect the results to have the same dependence on the function @xmath29 .",
    "accordingly , the correlations between the weights at different temperatures will be equal in the two classes of models .",
    "the previous conjecture could be proved if we were able to carry out the sum over all the solutions .",
    "this problem is common to many models where one would like to recover within the replica framework a result which is known _ a priori _ ( e.g. in the rem @xcite ) , or which can be obtained through different methods ( e.g. the spherical @xmath0-spin model where the absence of chaos in easily seen within the tap approach @xcite ) . in section 4",
    "we discuss some technical difficulties connected with this problem . at the end",
    "we give our conclusions .",
    "technical details are skipped to the appendices .",
    "we recall the method discussed in [ i ] to study the correlations between states at different temperatures . the replica trick is usually used in order to compute the average over the disorder of the free energy by computing the moments of the partition function @xmath32 . in the thermodynamic limit saddle point",
    "( sp ) equations are obtained for the order parameter which is an @xmath33 matrix @xmath34 .",
    "an outcome of the computation is that the order parameter is connected to the distribution of the overlaps through the relation    @xmath35    where the function @xmath36 is the averaged probability density of finding two states with overlap @xmath37 according to their gibbs weight , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are two different replica indices ( e.g. 1 and 2 ) . in the r.h.s . of ( [ pq1 ] )",
    "there appears a sum over all the different solutions of the saddle point equation with the same ( maximum ) free energy ; indeed , as soon as replica symmetry is broken , we have many solutions : given a certain solution others can be obtained through a permutation of the replica indices .",
    "however , in the isothermal case , all the solutions are given by the parisi solution plus its natural permutations ; therefore the sum over them can be replaced with an average over the replica indices multiplied by the total number of different solutions , which in the @xmath40 limit goes to @xmath41 @xcite . in [ i ]",
    "it has been shown that the correlations between states at different temperatures can be investigated through the computation of the @xmath42 limit of the quantity @xmath43 . as a matter of fact",
    ", we are not interested in its actual value ( which must be equal to the sum of the free energies at temperature @xmath2 and @xmath5 ) , but in the saddle point equation obtained by applying the replica trick to the whole @xmath44 and not to @xmath45 and @xmath46 separately , the inverse of its temperature . therefore a claim like `` the free energy of the two systems must be equal to the sum of the free energies at temperature @xmath3 and @xmath6 '' is shorthand for `` the logarithm of the partition function of the two systems must be equal to the sum of the logarithms of the partition functions at temperature @xmath3 and @xmath6 '' . ] . in this case one",
    "obtains sp equations for a @xmath47 matrix @xmath48 , where @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath51 are @xmath33 matrices .",
    "the advantage of this procedure is that the matrix @xmath51 encodes information on the correlations between states at different temperatures ; indeed , through the same steps that led to ( [ pq1 ] ) it can be shown that @xmath52 where the function @xmath53 is the generalization of the @xmath36 to states at different temperatures .",
    "as above , we have to sum over all the solutions of the sp equations : this is quite a delicate point ; indeed we do not expect that all solutions be natural permutations of a single solution as in the isothermal case ( i.e. the standard parisi solution ) . actually , there are infinite solutions corresponding to different parameterizations and we do nt know how to sum them all .",
    "however , it is possible to reconstruct the function @xmath53 in an indirect way by knowing the weight distribution of the equilibrium states .",
    "we have applied the method to the spherical spin - glass model with multi-@xmath1-spin interaction @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is defined as@xmath54 the @xmath55 s are independent gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance @xmath56 .",
    "the spins are subjected to the spherical constraint @xmath57 . introducing the function @xmath58",
    "the replicated free energy reads @xmath59-\\tr\\ln q - n\\ ] ] where the variational parameter is an @xmath33 matrix @xmath34 with diagonal @xmath60 .",
    "the sp equations then read@xmath61 expressing @xmath34 as a parisi function we obtain the solution as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is defined as the inverse of the universal function@xmath64 with the value of @xmath65 fixed by@xmath66 in the presence of a small magnetic field there is also a small plateau of temperature - independent height @xmath67 fixed by the condition@xmath68 when we consider simultaneously two systems at different temperature , we get the following expression for @xmath44 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath69 @xmath70 the corresponding sp equations are similar to those for the isothermal case ( [ spsingle ] ) and are reported in appendix 2 .",
    "a solution of the sp equations is certainly the one with @xmath71 and @xmath72 and @xmath50 equal to the corresponding isothermal solutions .",
    "its free energy is given by the sum of the free energies at temperatures @xmath2 and @xmath5 as expected .",
    "the problem is whether other solutions exist with a non - zero @xmath51 and with the same free energy of the @xmath71 solution . in [ i ]",
    "a particular structure was proposed for these @xmath73 solutions ( called non - chaotic , since their existence implies absence of chaos in temperature ) ; we found that solutions having such a structure do exist for this class of models .",
    "actually there is an infinite number of solutions which are parameterized by the value @xmath74 of the diagonal of @xmath51 , whose value ranges from zero to a maximum one , which , for these models , turns out to be the self - overlap of the states at the higher temperature .",
    "the solution with @xmath75 is included in this set and corresponds to the value @xmath76 .",
    "it is very interesting to notice that they exist also when the two systems at different temperatures are subjected to the same magnetic field ( see appendix 2 ) . here for simplicity we will refer to the @xmath77 case . for a given value of @xmath74 the solutions in terms of the three functions @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are@xmath81    where @xmath63 and @xmath31 are the universal function defined above .",
    "these solutions can be built for any couple of temperatures @xmath82 both below the critical temperature and for any @xmath74 between zero and @xmath83 which is the self - overlap of the states of the system at the higher temperature .",
    "the solutions are sketched in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "notice that @xmath84,@xmath85 and @xmath86 are all equal in the small-@xmath87 region .",
    "this is connected with the fact that this class of models verifies the scaling @xmath88 .",
    "we skip to appendix 2 the demonstration that these functions solve the sp equations and have the correct free energy .",
    "it must be remarked that the solutions ( [ solq],[solp ] ) are formally the same which have been found with a similar treatment of the grem @xcite , with a different model - dependent function @xmath29 . at this stage",
    "we can infer that the function @xmath53 has a non - zero support from zero to the self - overlap of the states at the higher temperature .",
    "the solutions we found imply ultrametricity between states at different temperatures of a given system . to see this we must consider the probability @xmath89 of extracting three states at different temperatures with assigned values of their mutual overlap . if we assume , for instance , that states @xmath90 and @xmath91 are at temperature @xmath2 and state @xmath92 is at temperature @xmath5 , this function is related to the solutions of the sp equation through the following relation@xmath93 we are not able to perform the sum over solutions in r.h.s of the previous expression , but we can infer ultrametricity by simply looking at their structure .",

    "we are unable to perform such a sum but we have a line of reasoning to guess which may be the result .",
    "indeed , the previous expression does not depend on the model under consideration ; it is a general outcome of the replica trick .",

    "there is a corresponding solution of the grem with the same parameterization .",
    "since there is a one - to - one correspondence between solutions of the grem and solutions of the multi-@xmath0-spin spherical model , we expect all the quantities of interest to have the same formal dependence on the temperatures and on the universal function @xmath124 .",

    "according to the previous argument the reference free energies of the various clusters are fixed at all temperatures , in particular the ordering of the clusters according to them does not change ; however , this does not mean that the ordering of the clusters according to their actual weights is also conserved : this is only true on average .",
    "in other words , it is not true that to the heaviest cluster at a given temperature corresponds the heaviest cluster at a lower temperature .",
    "in the previous sections we saw that in order to obtain the quantities of interest we should perform sums over all the different solutions of the sp equations of the functional ( [ fun2 ] ) . here",
    "we intend to discuss one of the main difficulties which prevents us from performing such sums , i.e. the existence of an infinite set of solutions corresponding to different parameterizations of the @xmath129 order parameter @xmath130 .    by applying the same technique of section 2 to the rem @xcite we found the same essential features of the problem . here",
    "the solution of the standard isothermal problem is a very simple @xmath24 whose value is @xmath106 for @xmath131 and @xmath41 for @xmath132 ; this is the simplest case of a solution that verifies the so - called parisi - toulouse scaling @xmath133 @xcite , which is also found in models with full rsb like those we are considering .",

    "an infinite set of possible parameterizations of the @xmath129 order parameter @xmath130 in terms of parisi matrices is obtained .    however , not all the parameterizations give new solutions .",

    "it can be seen that this is nothing but a permutation of the solution in which @xmath135,@xmath136 and @xmath105 are 1rsb matrices with @xmath150 ( see also the discussion in the conclusions ) .",
    "therefore the @xmath151-system parameterization does not add anything new in this case .",
    "however , the 4-system parameterization describes also the following solution @xmath152 this solution can not be obtained through a permutation from the solution of the type ( [ solq],[solp ] ) and should be counted separately .",
    "essentially , this parameterization corresponds to two systems ( system @xmath41 and @xmath153 ) at temperature @xmath3 correlated with a system at temperature @xmath6 ( system @xmath154 ) , while system @xmath151 at @xmath6 is completely uncorrelated to the remaining three .",
    "accordingly , in summing over all the different solutions we must consider the infinite set of solutions whose parameterization corresponds to a generic number of @xmath155 systems at temperature @xmath3 correlated to a generic number of @xmath156 systems at temperature @xmath6 , plus @xmath157 ( if @xmath158 ) uncorrelated systems at temperature @xmath3 ( in order to have the same number of system at each temperature ) . the scaling of the correlated components is @xmath159 , i.e. in the rem the correlated components are described by 1rsb function with @xmath160 .    according to [ i ] any solution with a given parameterization",
    "can also be considered as solution of a certain constrained system .",
    "for instance , the blocks @xmath161,@xmath162,@xmath163,@xmath164,@xmath165,@xmath166 , in the solution ( [ sol3 ] ) correspond to a system of three real replicas which are constrained to have maximum overlap ( i.e. @xmath41 in the rem ) among themselves .",
    "when considering a constrained system the problem of summing over all solutions greatly simplifies ; indeed in this case we have only one solution plus its natural permutations and we can perform the sum in the standard way by replacing it with a sum over indices . the result is immediate , for the @xmath167 of the constrained system we have @xmath168 .",
    "we define the `` free energy '' @xmath169 of a state of the global system ( composed of two constrained systems ) as @xmath170/\\sum_\\beta \\exp [ -f_\\beta]$ ] ( see footnote 1 ) .",
    "then we obtain that these free energies are independent random variables such that the average number of states with free energies between @xmath171 and @xmath172 is @xmath173df$ ] .",
    "this result is precisely what is obtained noticing that the states of the constrained system are triplets of identical states of the single system ; therefore in the rem their free energy is simply given by @xmath174 ( see footnote 1 ) and the distribution of @xmath175 is proportional to @xmath176=\\exp[\\beta_2 x_2 f]=\\exp[f]$ ] .",
    "the same line of reasoning applies to the models we considered in the previous sections as well : it ensures that the results obtained by considering constrained systems ( the only case in which we are able to sum over the solutions explicitly ) are fully consistent with our guess on the distribution of the free energies made in section 3 .",
    "we proved the existence of correlations between the equilibrium states at different temperatures of the spherical spin - glass models with multi-@xmath0 spin interactions for values of the coupling constants such that they display full rsb : there is no chaos in temperature in such models .",
    "furthermore , the overlaps between states at different temperatures satisfy ultrametric relations .",
    "ultrametricity determines a one - to - one correspondence between the trees of states at different temperature : to any cluster of states at temperature @xmath3 at a given level of the tree corresponds a  twin \" cluster of states at temperature @xmath6 ; the precise meaning of this correspondence has been discussed in details in the introduction and in section 2 . from a purely geometrical point of view",
    "we may say that there is only one tree of states at all temperatures , whose details are revealed lowering the temperature .",
    "prompted by some technical features of the problem , we conjectured that the reference free energies of two twins clusters are equal at all temperatures , exactly as in the grem",
    ". consequently , we expect that quantities like the @xmath53 in these models are the same as the grem .",
    "more precisely we expect them to have the same formal dependence on the temperatures and on the function @xmath31 , whose actual values will be different in the two classes of models .    the scenario of a tree of states which bifurcates when lowering the temperature was suggested early in spin - glass studies @xcite and was later advocated in order to explain the phenomenology of rejuvenation and memory in spin - glasses @xcite . according to our findings , the basic premises of that phenomenological picture of off - equilibrium dynamics hold for the class of models considered here ; we believe that this further increases the need for a complete understanding of the relationship between the equilibrium energy landscape and the off - equilibrium dynamics in spin - glasses .    within the tap approach @xcite strong correlations between the equilibrium states at different temperatures",
    "are readily obtained in the spherical @xmath1-spin model with 1rsb @xcite . indeed in this model",
    "the angular and the self - overlap contributions to the tap free energy can be factored ; that is if we write @xmath177 , we have that the angular part @xmath178 enters the expression of the tap free energy only in the form @xmath179 . accordingly ,",
    "the angular components of the states , which are the extrema of the free energy , are the same at all temperatures . to our knowledge",
    "this was the only result on the absence of chaos previously obtained for a spin - glass model .",
    "the previous argument can not be used in dealing with spherical spin - glass models with multi-@xmath0 interactions for values of the coupling constants such that they display either 1rsb or full - rsb .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath180 model there is an angular dependence of the form @xmath181 and no factorization is possible .",
    "indeed , when the temperature changes the self - overlap changes with it causing the angular landscapes corresponding to the two interactions to interpenetrate . it would be interesting to understand how this process leads to the properties we found within the replica approach .",
    "furthermore , we recall that the off - equilibrium dynamics @xcite is connected to the tap free - energy landscape @xcite .    as discussed in [ i ] , the solutions ( [ solq],[solp ] ) have the same free energy of the @xmath75 solution .",
    "this can be also derived noticing that they form a continuous line in the space of the matrices @xmath130 parameterized by the value of the continuous parameter @xmath96 .",
    "the value @xmath76 corresponds to the standard parisi solutions at the two temperatures . on this continuous line of solutions",
    "we have @xmath182 by definition ; therefore the free energy is constant and equal to that of the @xmath76 solution .",
    "the previous argument has deep consequences .",
    "it provides an easy way to understand the goldstone theorem for disordered systems with full rsb which has been proved and discussed in @xcite .",
    "this theorem connects the presence of goldstone modes in spin - glasses with continuous rsb with the fact that the discrete permutational symmetry within the replica approach becomes a continuous symmetry when the number of rsb steps goes to infinity .",
    "consider the standard replica formulation of a given model : it deals with a @xmath143 order parameter @xmath183 . instead of making the parisi ansatz on it",
    ", we can divide it in four @xmath184 blocks and make the parisi ansatz on each of these blocks separately , i.e. we assume that the two diagonal blocks are equal to an ultrametric @xmath185 matrix @xmath186 and the two off - diagonal blocks are equal to a @xmath184 ultrametric matrix @xmath187",
    ". then the sp equations are written in terms of two functions @xmath24 and @xmath86 defined on the interval @xmath188 $ ] , but in the @xmath141 limit the equations are identical to those obtained considering @xmath189 replicas with an order parameter @xmath130 parameterized by four @xmath143 matrices , the two diagonal ones equal to @xmath183 and the two off - diagonal ones equal to @xmath190 .",
    "this is a special case ( @xmath191 ) of the problem we considered in this paper . in this case",
    "@xcite the solutions corresponding to ( [ solq],[solp ] ) read @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the standard parisi solution and @xmath96 is a continuous parameter with range @xmath194 $ ] ; every value of @xmath96 specifies a solution . as stated above , these solutions , first obtained considering @xmath189 replicas , solve the standard @xmath97-replica problem too . at this point",
    "we can make the following statements :    * these solutions exist in every model with parisi rsb , either discrete of continuous .",
    "this statement has already appeared in @xcite where it is claimed that it is implied by ultrametricity .",
    "we justify this result noticing that these solutions are _ permutations _ of the standard parisi solution , as it is readily understood considering fig .",
    "( [ figure0 ] ) .",
    "* when the model has full rsb the parameter @xmath96 is continuous , therefore the solutions form a continuous line of constant free energy . as a consequences on every point of the line",

    "it s a pleasure to thank my family for constant help and support .",
    "in this appendix we derive the formulas to compute a generic function ( e.g. inverse , logarithm  ) of one or more parisi matrices . using the standard eigenvalue technique",
    "one encounters some difficulties .",
    "the main problem is that in the @xmath141 limit the matrix ceases to be determined univocally by the set of its eigenvalues . for a generic parisi matrix parameterized as @xmath195",
    "the eigenvalues are @xcite @xmath196 two important eigenvalues are @xmath197 and @xmath198 , in this context the bar means integration of the parisi function @xmath199 over the interval @xmath200 $ ] . by direct inspection",
