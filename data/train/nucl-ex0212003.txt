    "close to the kinematical threshold the total cross section for the meson production via the nucleon - nucleon interaction grows rapidly with increasing excess energy  q. it is well established  @xcite that for the @xmath0  @xcite and @xmath3  @xcite reactions this total cross section changes by about two orders of magnitude within a q range of about ten mev .",
    "the shape of the excitation function is predominantly determined by the changes of the phase space volume and by the final state interaction among the produced particles .",
    "the precision of the experiments performed at the cooler synchrotrons allows to distinguish the subtle effects originating from the meson - nucleon interaction .",
    "a quantitative derivation of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 hadronic potentials requires , however , a sophisticated theoretical treatment since the distortion caused by the nucleons is by orders of magnitude larger than that due to the meson  nucleon forces , and even small fractional inaccuracies in the description of nucleon  nucleon effects may obscure the inference on the meson  nucleon interaction . to minimize the ambiguities which may result from these discrepancies  at least for the qualitative estimation of the effects of the unknown meson  nucleon interaction  one can compare the spectra from the production of a meson under investigation to the spectra determined for the production of a meson whose interaction with nucleons is established . to visualize the influences of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 interaction on the energy dependence of the total cross section we have compared the modulus of the primary transition amplitude @xmath6 of the @xmath0 and @xmath3 reactions to the one extracted from the data on the @xmath7 reaction  @xcite",
    "-proton interaction is negligibly weak in comparison to the proton - proton one .",
    "the real part of the @xmath8 scattering length ( @xmath9  fm  @xcite ) is more than a factor of 50 smaller than @xmath10  fm  @xcite . ] .",
    "figures  [ ratio]a and  [ ratio]b show the dependence of @xmath6 on the phase ",
    "space volume for @xmath1 and @xmath2 production normalized to @xmath11 .",
    "the values of @xmath6 were extracted from the experimental data disregarding the proton  meson interaction . if the influence of the neglected interactions were the same in the case of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 production the points would be consistent with the solid line .",
    "this holds in case of the @xmath14 reaction indicating the weakness of the proton@xmath2 interaction independently of the prescription used for the proton  proton fsi  @xcite . in case of the @xmath2 meson",
    "energy interaction with the nucleons was expected to be very weak since there exists no baryonic resonance which would decay into @xmath15 channel  @xcite . in contrary",
    ", the existence of the @xmath16 resonance , which decays significantly into nucleon and the @xmath1 meson , indicates that the @xmath17 interaction is much stronger than the @xmath18 one , and indeed as depicted in figure  [ ratio]a the strong effects of the @xmath19 fsi at low @xmath20 are visible .    as a next step for a quantitative understanding of the @xmath21 dynamics a full three - body description of the system with the complex hadronic potentials",
    "is required as well as an exact determination of the magnitudes of the contributing partial waves .",
    "some aspects of the latter issue are discussed in the next section .",
    "on previous conferences we have already reported on the phase space density distribution determined for the @xmath0 reaction at an excess energy of q  =  15.5  mev  @xcite . the obtained spectrum",
    "  shown here in figure  [ figure2 ]   revealed a strong deviation from the expectation based on the factorization of the transition amplitude into the constant primary production and the on - shell incoherent pairwise interaction among the produced particles ( see solid and dashed lines ) .",
    "the experimental data obtained independently by tof  @xcite and cosy-11  @xcite using different detection systems agree perfectly with each other and make possible systematical errors rather improbable .",
    "the data show also a fully isotropic distribution over the polar emission angle of the @xmath1 meson in the center - of - mass frame  @xcite , and are consistent with an isotropic angular distribution of the relative momentum of the protons seen in the center - of - mass system  @xcite ( angle @xmath22 on the middle side of figure  [ figure2 ] ) .    according to preliminary investigations based on the meson exchange model  @xcite ,",
    "the observed distribution of the proton - proton invariant mass can not be explained assuming that the production of the outgoing particles takes place exclusively with the relative angular momentum equal to zero .",
    "the discrepancy between the solid line of figure  [ figure2 ] and the data is also too large to be explained by the underestimation of the s - wave proton-@xmath1 interaction .",
    "inspired by that difficulty we checked the partial wave distribution in the proton - proton system deriving from the data the angular distribution of the proton momentum in the rest frame of proton - proton system ( angle @xmath23 on the right side of figure  [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "a possible non - zero angular momentum between outgoing protons should manifest itself in an unisotropic population of the angle between the relative proton - proton momentum and the recoil particle  ( @xmath1 ) seen from the di - proton rest system  @xcite .",
    "the distributions determined for three intervals of @xmath24 are shown in figure  [ figure3 ] .",
    "as a first step we restricted the analysis assuming that only s and p waves contribute , and we fit the data by the linear combination of the legendre polynomials up to the second degree , which in case of two identical particles reads : @xmath25 . in this representation",
    "the parameter @xmath26 is a measure of the relative amplitude of the p and s  wave contributions .    as a result we obtained that @xmath26 is consistent with zero for @xmath27  gev@xmath28/c@xmath29 and amounts to @xmath30 for the middle and upper ranges of @xmath24 .",
    "this value supports the hypothesis that an admixture of p - waves in the proton - proton subsystem is not negligible already at an excess energy of q  =  15.5  mev .",
