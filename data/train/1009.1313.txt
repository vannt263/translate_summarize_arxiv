    "systems of ultracold atoms in optical lattices provide a unique playground for controlled realizations of many - body physics @xcite . for sufficiently deep lattices ,",
    "the kinetics is exhausted by tunneling processes , and an initially weak interparticle interaction eventually becomes important with respect to the kinetics , when the lattice is ramped up .",
    "a consequence of this competition is the quantum phase transition from a superfluid of delocalized bosons to a mott insulator where the particles are localized at minima of the lattice by a repulsive contact interaction fish .",
    "this effect has been observed in seminal experiments with ultracold rubidium atoms in a cubic lattice @xcite .",
    "it is described quantitatively by means of the simple bose - hubbard model @xcite , whose parameters are the interaction energy @xmath0 for each pair of particles occupying the same lattice site , and the matrix element @xmath1 for tunneling between neighboring sites .",
    "intriguing hubbard - type physics can also be observed if the above scenario is extended to fermions , mixtures of several particle species , exotic lattice geometries , or long - ranged dipolar interaction @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a different type of extension of the bosonic hubbard model , becoming relevant when the interaction between the particles is enhanced , e.g , by means of a feshbach resonance .",
    "as long as the interaction is weak compared to the lattice potential , a system of ultracold atoms can be described , to a good approximation , in terms of the lowest - band single - particle bloch or wannier states , the latter being localized at the minima of the lattice @xcite . under these conditions , the hubbard interaction @xmath0 and tunneling parameter @xmath1",
    "are given by respective matrix elements with respect to the single - particle wannier states .",
    "this approximation corresponds to degenerate perturbation theory up to first order with respect to the interaction , with only the intraband coupling induced by the interaction taken into account .",
    "however , if the interaction is stronger , higher - order corrections start playing a role",
    ". one may still describe the system in terms of lattice - site occupation numbers @xmath2 , but the occupied wannier - like orbitals will have admixtures from higher bands , depending on the occupation .",
    "the most significant effect of the repulsive interaction will be a broadening of the wannier - like orbitals with increasing occupation , effectively enhancing @xmath1 and decreasing @xmath0 . in terms of the hubbard description , we take this into account by replacing @xmath1 and @xmath0 by functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the number operators @xmath5 .",
    "quantitative consequences of this kind of modification to the plain bosonic hubbard model have been studied by several authors at a theoretical level @xcite .",

    "re - entrant behaviour in the superfluid - mott transition has also been predicted due to the interaction - induced modification of hubbard parameters @xcite .",
    "the effect of interaction on the tunneling dynamics in one - dimensional double - well and triple - well potentials have been studied in refs . @xcite where the authors found enhanced correlated pair tunneling near the fermionization limit .",

    "while @xmath52 corresponds to an incompressible mott - insulator state with an integer number of particles @xmath43 per site ( found within a finite interval of the chemical potential @xmath27 ) , the superfluid state is characterized by @xmath53 with order parameter @xmath54 . in the superfluid phase ,",
    "the average particle number per site is characterized by @xmath51 depending smoothly on the chemical potential . for @xmath55 , the transition to",
    "the superfluid occurs mainly via the creation of holes , while for @xmath51 near @xmath56 particle creation is the main mechanism destroying the mott phase . in the latter case ,",
    "the mott insulator becomes unstable when the energy cost of creating an additional particle at one site , namely @xmath57 , is overcome by the reduction in energy due to tunneling of that particle , which is on the order of @xmath58 , with coordination number @xmath59 for the cubic lattice .",
    "thus , when @xmath60 minimizes for non - zero @xmath50 , the mott state becomes unstable with respect to single particle and hole excitations . for interaction strength @xmath61 and @xmath62",

    "so far , we have described the usual scenario of the mott phase becoming instable with respect to particle and hole delocalization , as it is also found for non - number - dependent hubbard coupling @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "however , we will now show that  as a consequence of occupation dependent hopping and on - site interaction  the mott insulator with @xmath65 can become unstable with respect to the creation of pairs of particles already before the creation of single particles becomes favorable .",
    "consider a pair excitation with one additional particle at site @xmath46 and another one at the neighboring site @xmath66 , corresponding to the state @xmath67 .",
    "such a _ bond - centered _ or extended pair excitation at @xmath68 can tunnel coherently to a neighboring bond , say @xmath69 , with @xmath70 being another neighbor of @xmath46 .",
    "generally , bonds are considered neighbors if they share a common site .",
    "such a pair tunneling processes occurs in second order with respect to single - particle tunneling via the virtual site - centered pair state @xmath71 , which has larger energy . according to second - order degenerate perturbation theory ,",
    "the amplitude of the pair tunneling process is given by @xmath72 .",
    "on the same footing , perturbation theory gives the binding energy of @xmath73 for the bond - centered pair due to number fluctuations within the pair .",
    "for a cubic lattice of sites , the bond - centered pair excitations live on an exotic lattice of coordination number @xmath74 , being a generalization of the two - dimensional checkerboard lattice ( see the rightmost drawing in fig .  [ checker ] ) to three dimensions .",

    "in contrast , two additional particles , not forming a pair , can reduce their energy by @xmath76 when delocalizing on the cubic lattice of sites ( coordination number 6 ) .",
    "thus , according to perturbation theory , the formation of a bond - centered pair is favorable if @xmath77 . for certain scattering lengths",
    "@xmath7 , this condition can be fulfilled , since the wannier - broadening with increasing scattering lengths leads to an increase of both @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in such a situation",
    ", the mott - insulator state becomes unstable with respect to the creation of bond - centered pairs rather than with respect to the creation of single - particle excitations .",
    "this happens when the delocalization energy @xmath80 overcomes the energy @xmath81 needed to create a pair excitation .",
    "it is interesting to note that an equivalent scenario does not happen for hole excitations , since hole excitations decrease the occupation number and with that the tunneling amplitudes .    to evaluate the boundary of the @xmath65 mott - insulator phase within mean - field approximation , we construct a model for the excited bond - centered pair excitations .",
    "when the number of pairs is small compared to the number of sites , the hamiltonian for the pairs living on top of a mott state with one particle per site can be written as @xmath82here , @xmath83 labels the bonds of the cubic lattice and @xmath84 denotes pairs of nearest neighbors of these bonds as they are described by the three - dimensional checkerboard lattice ( cf .",
    "[ checker ] ) .",
    "moreover , we have defined the bosonic creation and destruction operators for bond - centered pair - excitations @xmath85 and @xmath86 , with number operator @xmath87 . as a consequence of the diluteness assumption ,",
    "we have neglected the interaction between pairs , arising if pairs occupy neighboring bonds .",
    "since the transition to a pair - superfluid will happen with the creation of a single pair , this approximation will not influence the phase boundary .",
    "the energy of a condensate of bond - centered pairs can now be estimated in a similar fashion as before by making a product ansatz @xmath88 of coherent states being a superposition of zero and one pair at each bond , @xmath89the order parameter of the pair condensate is defined by @xmath90 . according to this ansatz",
    ", the variational mean - field energy per site can be written as @xmath91where @xmath74 is the coordination number of the three - dimensional checkerboard lattice .",
    "the mean - field approach gives the same phase boundary for the appearance of a pair condensate with finite order parameter @xmath92 as the perturbation theoretical considerations of the previous paragraph .",
    "the equivalence of both approaches is generally given for an ansatz like ( [ ss1 ] ) which includes only two states per site .",
    "in figure [ epp ] we plot the results of minimizing @xmath93 with respect to @xmath94 for @xmath61 .",
    "the stable mott region with respect to single particle - hole excitation is given by the interior of the black solid and dotted line characterized by @xmath95 .",
    "on the right hand side of the blue dashed line in fig .",
    "[ epp ] one finds a region where @xmath96<\\min[e_{\\mathrm{ss}}]$ ] with @xmath97 .",
    "thus , here the system is characterized by @xmath98 and @xmath99 , i.e. , the state is a superfluid of extended pairs ( epsf ) .",
    "condensates of extended pairs have also been proposed in the context of dimer models of reduced dimensions , describing frustrated magnets like srcu@xmath100(bo@xmath101)@xmath102 @xcite . by approximating triplet excitations as hard - core bosons , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite argue that for correlated hopping these bosons can condense in pairs .",
    "such pairing processes also bear resemblance to molecular condensation due to feshbach resonances in an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "we would like to point out that triple , quadruple or higher order excitations do not play a dominant role .",
    "the effective tunneling matrix element of such excitations will be very small since it appears in third or higher order perturbation theory only .",
    "therefore inside a @xmath65 phase , triple and higher excitations can not lower their energy efficiently by delocalization .",
    "we can , thus , exclude a superfluid of triples or higher order objects .",

    ", one can create a huge cluster of extra particles , i.e. , a big spatial domain with doubly occupied sites . in this case , within each cluster , the energy of the additional particles ( on top of the @xmath65 mott background ) is not lowered by delocalization , but rather by the attractive interaction between them as it appears in second order perturbation theory . in the bulk of such a cluster , this gives a binding energy of @xmath103 per extra particle .",
    "in comparison , in the pair superfluid each particle can lower its energy by @xmath104 because of binding and further by another @xmath105 because of delocalization ( i.e. , bose condensation ) . accordingly , in leading order a superfluid of bond - centered pairs on top of the @xmath65 mott insulator is equally favorable as a phase separated state with spatial domains hosting either a mott insulator of filling @xmath65 or @xmath106 . as a consequence , we can not reliably exclude phase separation by means of simple variational arguments .    before moving on ,",
    "let us briefly discuss another issue : in this article , we are working in a situation with the chemical potential fixed rather than the particle number .",
    "this approach is actually quite suitable for the description of experiments with ultracold atoms , provided the atoms are trapped by a sufficiently shallow potential . in such a situation , the local density approximation applies and different regions in the trap correspond to different values of the chemical potential .",
    "however , if the trap is too steep for the local density approximation to be valid , it might introduce also new physics .",
    "consider the following example : the phase separated state described in the preceding paragraph might not be favored in the homogeneous system .",
    "but , because it is energetically very close to the pair superfluid , it can be favored already when a slight potential difference is introduced , helping to form @xmath106 mott domains in the region of slightly lower potential energy .",
    "such a scenario can spoil the local density approximation already for a very weak trapping potential .",
    "now , let us consider a regime that can be achieved if the interaction strength @xmath107 is increased further . considering again",
    "the @xmath62 mott insulator , for increasing interaction a site - centered pair excitation , described by @xmath108 , eventually becomes more favorable than the bond - centered excitations described by @xmath109 .",
    "this happens when the ratio @xmath110 is reduced so much that the potential energy @xmath111 needed to create a pair of particles on the same site equals the potential energy @xmath112 required to create a pair of particles on neighboring sites .",
    "such a situation is possible as can be derived from eq .",

    "the pairs occupy the lattice given by both the sites and the bonds of the cubic lattice ( see fig .",

    "; this is the case for @xmath122 .",
    "thus , the binding mechanism of the pair is based solely on the delocalization of its center of mass . at @xmath123 ( given , e.g. , for @xmath124 when @xmath125 ) , the @xmath62 mott insulator becomes unstable with respect to pair creation when @xmath120 exceeds @xmath126 .",
    "it is fascinating to observe the emergence of exotic lattice geometries as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ checker ] as a consequence of pair creation .",
    "if the scattering length is increased further , such that @xmath127 , site - centered pair excitations @xmath108 will be created rather than bond centered ones @xmath118 .",
    "the site - centered pair excitations can then tunnel from site to site coherently via the occupation of a virtual bond - centered pair excitation .",
    "the corresponding tunneling matrix element reads @xmath128 .",
    "moreover , the pair has a binding energy of @xmath129 ( stemming from a small perturbative admixture of the 6 neighboring bond - centered pair states ) .",
    "therefore , a site - centered pair is more favorable than two single - particle excitations if @xmath130 .",
    "if this condition is fulfilled , the mott insulator becomes rather unstable towards the creation of site - centered pair excitations than to the creation of single particles .",
    "the instability occurs when @xmath131 reaches @xmath126 . as before",

    "we plot the boundary of the @xmath65 mott phase for @xmath132 in fig .",
    "the instability towards the creation of single particles is hardly important .",
    "it is predominantly the creation of single holes or site - centered pairs of particles which destroys the mott phase .",

    "also , two - species mixtures of bosons with inter - species attraction trapped in an optical lattice have been shown to give rise to superfluidity of pairs @xcite . in the context of dipolar atoms in a two - leg ladder ,",
    "when no tunneling is present between the two legs , pair superfluidity arises due to attraction between the dipolar atoms between the two legs of the ladder @xcite .",
    "also , using a state - dependent optical lattice potential , it is possible to create correlated tunneling of on - site pairs , which in turn gives rise to superfluidity of local pairs @xcite . in our present study , we find that such local pairing can emerge due to the strong occupation - dependence of tunneling and on - site interaction .",
    "after having studied the boundaries of the mott - insulator phase with one particle per site , let us have a look at the @xmath106 mott state",
    ". in the limit of vanishing tunneling , a mott state with two particles localized at each site is favorable for @xmath134 .",
    "the upper border of this interval is given by the potential energy difference of having three and two particles at a site .",

    "the disappearance of the @xmath106 mott insulator coincides with site - centered pair excitations becoming more favorable than bond - centered ones in the limit of vanishing tunneling .",
    "note that the mott - insulator phases with higher filling , @xmath138 , do not disappear for large interaction @xmath107 within the gaussian approximation .",
    "the reason why these phases do not share the fate of the @xmath106 mott insulator is that the broadening on the wannier - like site - wave functions @xmath23 in response to adding one particle to that site becomes less pronounced with increasing occupation : @xmath139 .",
    "however , one should have in mind that for strong interaction , sites occupied by three and more particles suffer strong dissipation due to three - body collisions @xcite",

    "this instability occurs due to the attractive effect of the occupation dependent tunneling , which can overcome the decreased repulsive on - site interaction depending on the number of particles per site @xmath176 . to understand the effect of this instability",
    ", we first make a transition from the discrete hubbard model to a continuous model applicable for @xmath179 with a continuous field @xmath180 , @xmath181 here , the distance is expressed with respect to the lattice constant @xmath10 , and the effective interaction potential is given by @xmath182 $ ] , where @xmath183 stands for the inverse fourier transformation . using a gaussian ansatz along one direction ,",
    "say @xmath184 , and uniform in the other directions , @xmath185 , the energy functional for the self - trapped state reads @xmath186 when @xmath176 exceeds a critical density , @xmath187 is minimized for a finite @xmath188 .",
    "thus , the homogeneous superfluid becomes dynamically unstable towards a state which is localized only in one direction , forming a 2d slab .",
    "in this paper we have predicted various effects resulting from interaction - induced band mixing in systems of ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattice potentials .",
    "we have derived the modified bosonic hubbard model ( [ hub2 ] ) having occupation - number - dependent parameters .",
    "this model comprises an effective interaction - induced broadening of the wannier - like single - particle orbitals , and , thus , captures also the situation when the s - wave scattering length becomes comparable to the lattice spacing , @xmath189 . using this model",
    ", we find that for scattering lengths @xmath190 and lattice depths @xmath191 , the @xmath65 mott - insulator state can become unstable towards a superfluid which consists of bond - centered pair excitations .",
    "this scenario is novel considering the fact that the extended pairs emerge due to the occupation dependence of both the tunneling strength and the on - site interaction . for even higher interaction , the nature of the superfluid pair excitations ( destroying the insulator ) changes .",
    "the pairs can now occupy both the bonds on the lattice ( i.e. , two neighboring sites ) or its sites ; in that way an exotic lattice geometry as shown in the center plot of fig .  [ checker ]",
    "emerges . increasing the interaction further ,",
    "eventually the pairs live only on the sites of the lattice . in this regime of high interaction strength ,",
    "the @xmath106 mott state gets completely destroyed by the site - centered pair fluctuations .",
    "we have also looked into the regime where interaction induced wannier - broadening arises from large filling @xmath192 at small scattering lengths , @xmath193 . in this limit , we found that the superfluid becomes dynamically unstable due to the attractive nature of the occupation - dependent tunneling .",
    "the system then transforms from a uniform superfluid state to an asymmetric state which is localized in one direction and extended in the other two directions .    in future studies",
    ", we would like to study the role of dissipation in these systems .",
    "also , a more accurate determination of the number dependence of the hubbard parameters @xmath194 and @xmath195 will be required for a quantitative description of the effects described here .",
    "finally , it would also be worth studying in detail the role of a trapping potential , as it is present in experiments .",
