    "thanks to neutrino - oscillation experiments much is known about the basic properties of the neutrino concerning its mixing and squared mass differences . what is not known is the absolute mass scale , the related mass hierarchy , and the fundamental nature ( dirac or majorana ) of the neutrino .",
    "this can be studied by analyzing the neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath3 ) decays of atomic nuclei @xcite through analyses of the participating nuclear matrix elements ( nmes ) .",
    "the @xmath3 decays proceed by virtual transitions through states of all multipoles @xmath4 in the intermediate nucleus , @xmath5 being the total angular momentum and @xmath6 being the parity of the intermediate state .",
    "most of the present interest is concentrated on the double beta - minus variant ( @xmath0 decay ) of the @xmath3 decays due to their relatively large decay energies ( @xmath7 values ) and natural abundancies .    in this work",
    "we concentrate on analyses of the intermediate contributions to the @xmath0 decays for the @xmath8 ground - state - to - ground - state and ground - state - to - excited - state transitions in nuclear systems of experimental interest .",
    "we focus on the light majorana neutrino mediated transitions by taking into account the appropriate short - range nucleon - nucleon correlations @xcite , and contributions arising from the induced currents and the finite nucleon size @xcite .",
    "there are several nuclear models that have recently been used to compute the @xmath0 decay nmes ( see , e.g. , the extensive discussions in @xcite ) . however , the only model that avoids the closure approximation and retains the contributions from individual intermediate states is the proton - neutron quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( pnqrpa ) @xcite .",
    "some analyses of the intermediate - state contributions within the pnqrpa approach have been performed in @xcite and recently quite extensively in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "an intermediate multipole @xmath4 decomposition was done for decays of @xmath9ge , @xmath10se , @xmath11zr , @xmath12mo , @xmath13pd , @xmath14cd , @xmath15sn , @xmath16te , @xmath17xe to the ground state of the respective daughter nuclei , whereas in @xcite both an intermediate multipole @xmath4 decomposition and a pair - angular - momentum decomposition were done for decays of @xmath9ge , @xmath10se , @xmath11zr , @xmath12mo , @xmath13pd , @xmath14cd , @xmath15sn , @xmath18te , @xmath17xe to the lowest one or two excited @xmath1 states of the respective daughter nuclei . in this article",
    "we extend the analyses of @xcite to a more detailed scrutiny of the intermediate contributions to the @xmath0 decay nmes of the above - mentioned nuclei .",
    "in this section a very brief introduction to the computational framework of the present calculations is given .",
    "the present analyses are based on the calculations done in refs .",
    "@xcite and more details on the used theory tools can be checked there and in @xcite .",
    "we assume here that the @xmath0 decay proceeds via the light majorana neutrino so that the inverse half - life can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a phase - space factor for the final - state leptons defined here without the axial - vector coupling constant @xmath21 .",
    "the quantity @xmath22 denotes the neutrino effective mass and describes the physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath23 is the light - neutrino nuclear matrix element ( l - nme ) .",
    "the nuclear matrix element can be decomposed into gamow - teller ( gt ) , fermi ( f ) and tensor ( t ) contributions as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the vector coupling constant .",
    "each of the nmes @xmath26 in ( [ eq:0nume ] ) can be decomposed in terms of the intermediate multipole contributions @xmath4 as @xmath27 where each multipole contribution is , in turn , decomposed in terms of the two - particle transition matrix elements and one - body transition densities as @xmath28_j \\vert \\vert j^{\\pi}_{k_{1 } } ) \\langle j^{\\pi}_{k_{1 } } \\vert j^{\\pi}_{k_{2 } } \\rangle ( j^{\\pi}_{k_{2 } } \\vert \\vert   \\left [ c^{\\dag}_{p } \\tilde{c}_{n}\\right]_j \\vert \\vert 0^{+}_{i } ) \\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 label the different pnqrpa solutions for a given multipole @xmath4 and the indices @xmath31 denote the proton and neutron single - particle quantum numbers .",
    "the operators @xmath32 inside the two - particle matrix element contain the neutrino potentials for the light majorana neutrinos , the characteristic two - particle operators for the different @xmath26 and a function taking into account the short - range correlations ( src ) between the two decaying neutrons in the mother nucleus of @xmath0 decay @xcite .",
    "the final @xmath1 state , @xmath33 , can be either the ground state or an excited state of the @xmath0 daugter nucleus , and the overlap factor between the two one - body transition densities helps connect the corresponding intermediate @xmath4 states emerging from the pnqrpa calculations in the mother and daughter nuclei .",
    "the one - body transition densities are exposed in detail in the articles @xcite .    as mentioned before",
    ", our calculations contain the appropriate short - range correlators , nucleon form factors and higher - order nucleonic weak currents .",
    "in addition , we decompose the particle - particle proton - neutron interaction strength parameter @xmath2 of the pnqrpa into its isoscalar ( @xmath34 ) and isovector ( @xmath35 ) components and adjust these components independently as described in @xcite : the isovector component is fixed such that the nme of the two - neutrino double beta decay ( @xmath36 ) vanishes and the isospin symmetry is thus restored for both the @xmath36 and @xmath0 decays .",
    "the isoscalar component , in turn , is fixed such that the measured half - life of the @xmath36 decay is reproduced .",
    "the resulting values of both components of @xmath2 are shown in table  i of ref .",
    "the details of the chosen valence spaces and the determination of the other hamiltonian parameters are presented in @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss and present the results of our calculations .",
    "presentation of the results follows top to bottom approach .",
    "first we analyze the multipole decompositions and total cumulative sums of the matrix elements . from these",
    "we can extract the most important multipole components and energy regions contibuting to the nmes .",
    "after this we continue and dissect the most important multipole components into contributions coming from different individual states of the @xmath37 intermediate nucleus . throughout these computations",
    "we have used a conservatively quenched value of the axial vector coupling @xmath38 .",
    "let us begin by considering the ground - state - to - ground - state decays mediated by light neutrino exchange . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rpa - decomp-96 - 136-gs ] ( a)-(b ) we have plotted the multipole decomposition ( [ eq : decomp ] ) of the l - nmes corresponding to the @xmath39 and 136 nuclear systems . for most nuclei considered in this work , the leading multipole component is @xmath40 this is the case also for the nucleus @xmath11zr shown in fig . [",
    "fig : rpa - decomp-96 - 136-gs ] ( a ) .",
    "most important contribution to the nmes comes from the lowest multipole components @xmath41 .",
    "it can also be observed that the shape of the overall multipole distribution is leveled when going towards heavier nuclei .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the distribution of @xmath11zr with the distribution of @xmath17xe displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : rpa - decomp-96 - 136-gs ] ( b ) .",
    "nuclei can be grouped into different types according to the shapes of their cumulative nme distributions . for @xmath42 transitions via light neutrino exchange",
    ", we can differentiate four types of nuclei . *",
    "type 1 * : nuclei belonging to this type are @xmath9ge , @xmath10se , @xmath11zr and @xmath43te",
    ". representative of this type , @xmath9ge , is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cumsuml-76 - 110 - 124 - 136 ] , panel ( a ) .",
    "characteristic feature of the cumulative sum distribution belonging to type 1 is the strong drop in the value of the nme occuring between 12 - 17 mev .",
    "soon after this drop the nme saturates as can be seen from panel ( a ) . *",
    "type 2 * : nuclei belonging to this type are @xmath12mo and @xmath13pd .",
    "representative of this type , @xmath13pd , is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cumsuml-76 - 110 - 124 - 136 ] , panel ( b ) .",
    "characteristic feature of this type is the large enhancement and almost immediate cancellation of this enhancement around 10 mev .",
    "this produces a spike like structure into the cumulative sum distribution as can be seen from panel ( b ) . *",
    "type 3 * : nuclei belonging to type 3 are @xmath14cd , @xmath15sn and @xmath18te .",
    "type 3 is represented by @xmath15sn , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cumsuml-76 - 110 - 124 - 136 ] , panel ( c ) .",
    "characteristic features of this type are that there occurs neither sharp cancellation of the nme around 12 - 17 mev , as in type 1 , nor a spike like structure around 10 mev , as in type 2 .",
    "value of the nme rather increases more or less smoothly to its highest value and then smoothly saturates to its final value around 20 mev . *",
    "type 4 * : type 4 is special in a sence that it icludes only one nucleus , @xmath17xe",
    ". cumulative sum of the nme for @xmath17xe is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cumsuml-76 - 110 - 124 - 136 ] , panel ( d ) .",
    "characteristic feature of type 4 is that the lowest energy region , roughly between 0 - 1.5 mev , contributes practically nothing to the value of the nme as can be noticed from panel ( d ) .        [",
