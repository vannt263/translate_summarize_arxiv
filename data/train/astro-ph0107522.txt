    "lyman @xmath7 ( ) absorption systems provide a powerful probe into the distribution of baryonic matter in the universe across the stages of galaxy evolution .",
    "the column density distribution function , @xmath8 is one way to characterise this distribution .",
    "@xmath8 is defined as the probability of intersecting a particular column density along a random line - of - sight per unit distance .",
    "it describes the cross - sectional area of sky occupied by a particular column density at a given redshift .",
    "traditionally @xmath8 is measured by absorption in the continuum spectra of background qsos . at high redshift @xmath8",
    "is well measured over 10 orders of magnitude in column desnity ( eg . tyler 1987 ; petitjean et al .",
    "1993 ) . at low redshift , since the  transition is in the uv and the occurrence of high column density absorbers is low , we have measured the neutral hydrogen column density distribution using 21-cm  emission . the purpose of this investigation is to calculate @xmath8 using a range of galaxy  masses and determine their contribution to the column density distribution function .    in the last few years it has become apparent that damped lyman @xmath7",
    "( d ) systems are not necessarily caused by the  disks of large spiral galaxies ( eg .",
    "rao & turnshek 1998 ; bowen , tripp , & jenkins 2001 ) .",
    "regardless of this , the paradigm of large spirals being responsible for the majority of the cross - section of column densities  @xmath9 at z=0 remains .",
    "according to dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) `` the agreement between ultraviolet and radio estimates of  is excellent and somewhat astonishing , considering that the angular resolution , experimental techniques , and telescopes differ in all respects '' .",
    "this statement refers to a comparsion of high latitude galatic  21-cm measurements compared with  absorption towards distant stars ( in the same direction ) in the range @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "one concern remains that high column density gas may clump on scales less than the beam size .",
    "this has been addressed by rao & briggs ( 1993 ) in their calculation of the contribution of high  gas to the mass function ( which is not affected by beam size ) compared with the integral of mass from the @xmath8 cross - section .",
    "they find the integral of mass in @xmath8 is equivalent to that from the mass function at high .",
    "they concluded that any high  column density gas missed due to a large beam size is negligible .",
    "the advantages of using 21-cm observations to measure column density , rather than  absorption are :    * for z@xmath121.65 ,  requires space based observations . *",
    "the space density of  absorbers at low redshift is small .",
    "indeed , rao & briggs ( 1993 ) estimated that 1000 random sight lines would be required to provide 10@xmath133 d@xmath14 systems . according to rao and turnshek ( 2000 ) 23 d@xmath14 systems",
    "are known at z@xmath151.65 .",
    "* significant evolution of the column density distribution is still expected between z@xmath161 and z=0 , so it is important provide an anchor point at z=0 .",
    "* foreground galaxies may hinder qso identification .",
    "extinction and reddening by dust in galaxies means that qsos may be preferentially found away from galaxies ( 0striker & heisler 1986 ) .",
    "previous calculations of the column density distribution function from 21-cm emission has published by rao & briggs ( 1993 ) and zwaan , verheijen , & briggs ( 1999 ) .",
    "the study by rao & briggs used arecibo observations of 27 large spiral galaxies .",
    "zwaan et al . on the other hand",
    "used synthesis observations of ursa major cluster members .",
    "the advantage of the method presented here is that a range of  mass galaxies are including in the sample from the whole sky , rather than a galaxy cluster , which are known to  deficient ( eg . solanes et al .",
    "the benefit of using a galaxy cluster is that the spatial resolution is the same in each map .",
    "we have preserved this feature by selecting galaxies within a tight velocity range .",
    "we have also used an  mass function for normalisation which is more appropriate than an optical luminosity function , used by the two previous studies .",
    "galaxies for this study were selected from the  parkes all sky survey ( hipass ) bright galaxy catalogue ( koribalski , 2000 ) .",
    "hipass is a blind survey for  covering the entire southern sky , thus providing a complete  selected sample .",
    "the 3@xmath17  mass limit of hipass is @xmath18 and the 3@xmath17 column density limit is @xmath19 @xmath11 . to provide a representative range of  mass , 36 galaxies were chosen randomly to fill six half decade  mass bins from @xmath0 to @xmath4 .",
    "galaxies were restricted to those with helocentric velocities in the range 500 to 1700  so that the spatial resolution across the sample remained comparable across the sample .",
    "the gridded fwhp beamwidth of hipass is 15.5  which means that most galaxies are poorly resolved .",
    "since the hipass maps provide a column density spread over the entire beam area , higher resolution mapping was required to measure distribution of column desnity .",
    "each galaxy was observed with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) with a minimum fwhm beam size of 30 .",
    "the typical 3@xmath17  column density limit for the observations was @xmath20 @xmath11 .",
    "the brightness temperature measured for each pixel in the synthesis map , t@xmath21 is converted to column density by the relationship : @xmath22 this calculation assumes that the gas is optically thin .",
    "dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) used typical galactic  parameters ( t@xmath23k and @xmath24 ) to show that the optical depth is greater than 1 for @xmath25 @xmath11 .",
    "consequently the column density may be underestimated as  approaches @xmath26 @xmath11 .",
    "the column density distribution function is then calculated by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the area in mpc@xmath29 occupied by a particular column density , in the range  to @xmath30 .",
    "the function is normalised by the space density @xmath31 taken from a hipass  mass function ( kilborn , 2000 ) .",
    "the  mass function has a faint end slope of @xmath32 and an characteristic  mass of @xmath33 .",
    "an @xmath34 of 75  mpc@xmath35 is adopted to match that of the  mass function and a value of @xmath36 dex is used throughout .",
    "the distance to each galaxy was calculated assuming the velocity represents the hubble flow and corrected for local group velocity .",
    "uncertainty in the distance is a large source of error ; it affects both  and the area function , @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath8 is plotted in figure 1 with a power law fitted with the form @xmath37 . from the figure it is evident that low  mass galaxies dominate @xmath8 at column densities in the range @xmath38 to @xmath39 @xmath11 . at the d  cutoff of @xmath39 @xmath11",
    "both mass types contribute equally . for @xmath40 @xmath11 ,",
    "m@xmath2 galaxies dominate the column density distribution function .",
    "from the  mass function we know that galaxies with @xmath41  contribute only 6% of the total  mass density at z=0 .",
    "indeed most of the  mass in the local universe is contained in galaxies with @xmath42  ( kilborn , 2000 ) .",
    "even though their contribution to the overall  mass density is minimal , the cross - sectional area presented by low mass galaxies for moderate column densities is significant .",
    "this result is interesting as it is not intuitively obvious .",
    "the space density of low  mass galaxies is sufficient to push their cross - sectional area at moderate  above that of m@xmath43 galaxies .",
    "the morphology of the galaxies in the lowest mass bin are generally irregular type .",
    "in contrast to those in the m@xmath44 mass bin which are generally early type spirals .",
    "this result has implications for the interpretation of the column density distribution function at all redshifts .",
    "if systems with = @xmath0  are responsible for a significant fraction of the moderate column density cross - section at low redshift , they may also cause a significant fraction of absorption systems at high redshift . as noted above",
    ", the typical morphology of these systems is irregular .",
    "normal spiral galaxies are known to decrease their star formation rate ( sfr ) with time , yet recent evidence suggests that irregular galaxies experience an increasing sfr with time ( xu et al .",
    "therefore galaxies associated with moderate  absorption systems at high redshift may have been missed due to low optical luminosity .",
    "we have shown that at z=0 , the contribution of low  mass galaxies to the column density distribution function is greater than m@xmath2 galaxies for  up to the d  cutoff .",
    "this result implies that moderate  absorption systems may be caused by a range of galaxy types and not just large spiral galaxies as originally thought ."
