    "in the context of fisheries resources , this article examines the feasibility of a management model where some regulatory authority limits the amount captured and access times .",
    "the above by fixing a fishing quota and a subsequent period of closure that last up to get a certain threshold biomass and so on .",
    "it is a mathematical continuous time model of one species unstructured and non - deterministic .",
    "the main novelty is the combination of three rules in the dynamics of abundance : ( a ) the addition to the growth rate of a white noise with amplitude proportional to the stock .",
    "( b ) the consideration of an impulsive extracction at certain threshold of the stock size .",
    "( c ) a constant quota fishing policy .",
    "_ concerning ( a ) _ : we have hypothesized a very general unstructured stochastic version model by means of a diffusion process .",
    "it consider that the infinitesimal increment ( @xmath0 ) of the abundance ( @xmath1 ) is the sum of the underlying deterministic dynamics tendencies ( @xmath2 ) plus the magnitud of the stochastic fluctuations at different populations sizes ( @xmath3 ) . among the sources of uncertainty",
    "to which a population may be subject , we will work with environmental stochasticity , _",
    "i.e. _ , following @xcite , where the infinitesimal variation @xmath4 can be modeled by @xmath5 .",
    "the _ environmental stochasticity _ involves considering randomness resulting from any change that affects the whole population and that does not diminish with its growth .",
    "there is abundant literature on population models with the presence of environmental noise . for models with this type of noise and capture ,",
    "when the harvest is incorporated additively as a density - dependent rate which is subtracted from the natural growth , an author to consider is c.a .",
    "braumann , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite , a quite general model for the growth of populations subjected to harvesting activities in a random environment is studied .",
    "there , conditions for non extinction and for the existence of stationary distributions ( where the noise intensity was constant or proportional to the rate of growth ) are looked for . in @xcite those results",
    "are generalized to density - dependent positive noise intensities of very general form .    _ concerning ( b ) _ :",
    "in population models that we have cited , which combine harvesting and environmental stochasticity , the population abundance variable is of continuous type . here",
    "we will assume pulse harvesting between closures , which implies piecewise continuous curves for the stock , and other type of control problems .",
    "due to the development of techniques for locating resources and deployability of arts and fishing effort , comparing with closures , the open intervals are considerably shorter .",
    "therefore , modelling the open season as an instant is realistic enough . for impulsive harvesting",
    "see : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "then , the amount harvested is just like a pulse in the abundance curve .",
    "the appearance of run for the resource , is another explanation for an instantaneous extraction of the quota .",
    "however , although the stock captured could be previously agreed , the run occurs when it appears a strong competition to be first in the markets .",
    "_ concerning ( c ) _ : the management rule assumes a continuous sampling of abundance .",
    "the open season begins when the size of the stock reaches a certain value @xmath6 and remains until a catch quota @xmath7 , @xmath8 is got it .",
    "then , a new closure starts from an abundance level @xmath9 , @xmath10 , that does not compromise the survival of the resource by population uncertainty , _",
    "i.e. _ , above the minimum viable population @xcite",
    ". the quota is split between the different actors engaged in fishing effort , when it is completed , it begins a period of closure that lasts until again the regulator announces a level of abundance @xmath11 .",
    "we named this regulation _ pulse constant quota fishing policy_.    under this management , without stochasticity and with a growth law autonomous of time , models of this type have monotonic and bounded abundance curves ( for values of @xmath6 under carrying capacity ) , which determines closures with finite length .",
    "closed seasons with finite duration , would theoretically could allow bioeconomic sustainability ( preservation and exploitation ) .",
    "however , if we consider the hypothesis of a stochastic component , for example , coming from environmental factors that determine the vital rates ( the biotic potential and the environmental resistance ) we have that the finiteness of the closures is not assured a priori .",
    "the main novelty problem that guided our research questions and the results was to find conditions on the model parameters and mainly on the noise level , for the viability ( finite closures ) of this fishery management .",
    "notice that in @xcite , in the framework of a continuous model , it is proved that in case of a constant quota ( a fixed amount harvested by unit of time ) in random environment , the abundance always goes to extinction .",
    "in theorem [ theo : main-1 ] is technical in nature and aims to prove that the model is well formulated .",
    "it solves the existence and uniqueness ( in the probabilistic sense ) of the growth curves of the resource from an initial time and level of biomass .",
    "its corollary 1 states that the model determines a finite population variance .",
    "the aim of theorem 2 is similar to that of theorem 1 , but this one proves the existence and uniqueness for all finite future time interval .",
    "finally , the main result , theorem [ theo : main-2 ] , shows that the expectation of a next opening time is finite , by establishing a condition that relates the lower value of the per capita growth rate for biomass values under @xmath11 with the parameter that indicates the amplitude of noise .",
    "in a first subsection we describe the regulatory basic fishery model ( deterministic ) and we derive the properties of the length of the closed seasons . in a second one",
    ", we will introduce stochasticity on the growth rate and formulate , with details , the research question . in both cases ,",
    "the main assumptions are highlighted . in all",
    "what follows we will denote by @xmath1 the abundance of the resource at some instant @xmath12 .      with respect to the growth of the stock , without stocasticity , let us consider the hypotesis that follows :    * h1 * : the _ per capita rate of growth ( deterministic ) _ is a continuous function @xmath13 , for which there exists a positive abundance level @xmath14 , the carrying capacity , such that @xmath15 ( _ resp .",

    "so that , we have a very natural hypothesis .",

    "notice that , if the resource has its developement with a random biotic potential or present a random environmental pressure , the capture times are also random variables that depend on the dynamics of growth of the resource .",

    "what is the statistical expectation for the length of the closure periods @xmath66 ?",
    "these are some of the questions that motivate our results .",
    "in order to get solutions of the model ( [ eq : sde - main ] ) we will use the scheme that follows :    * to prove the existence of a unique initial stochastic process ( without harvest ) , so that , a first segment of its trajectory can be taken as a solution of the equation ( [ eq : sde - main ] ) , on some interval @xmath67 $ ] , @xmath68 . * immediately after a probable instant of capture the stochastic model requires restarting the process from an abundance @xmath9 .",

    "finally , we will chain the pieces of trajectories for generating a unique extended solution of ( [ eq : sde - main ] ) .",
    "the classical theorems for stochastic differential equations , need a lipschitz condition and sublinear growth over drift and diffusion coefficient ( see theorem 5.2.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "these conditions , are too strong to be used directly in most population dynamics problems .",
