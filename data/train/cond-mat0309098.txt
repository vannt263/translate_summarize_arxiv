    "the convergence is however slower due to the divergence of the initial distribution near the velocity origin .",
    "we thus conjecture that not only the first sonine coefficient of probabilistic annihilation but also the full velocity distribution ( and hence , all decay exponents ) show an universal property in the sense that they do not depend on the initial velocity distribution if @xmath137 .",
    "this is a nontrivial result since it was shown that this is not true in the case of pure annihilation",
