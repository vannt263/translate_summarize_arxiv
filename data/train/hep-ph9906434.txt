    "the ideal case would be to calculate and include the full @xmath67 amplitudes , as well as the @xmath92 and @xmath267 terms .",
    "it would also be interesting to investigate the effect of higher resonances ( at least the vector mesons and presumably also the axial vector and scalar mesons ) .",
    "each of the additional effects separately is not expected to counteract largely the enhancement found for @xmath133",
    ". nevertheless , in the extreme ( and unlikely ) case where all these effects would come with the same sign a significant modification of the result can not be excluded formally . in order to reduce the scheme dependence in the result for @xmath0 appropriate subtractions",
    "would be necessary ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in view of the noticeable uncertainties connected still with both the calculation of the matrix elements and the exact values of the various parameters taken from theory and experiment , it is difficult to decide whether the large value of @xmath0 observed recently is indicating new physics beyond the standard model  @xcite . in this situation",
    "it is interesting to investigate other kaon decays in order to perform precision tests of flavour dynamics and to search for new physics  @xcite .",
    "in this article we have presented results of a new analysis for the cp parameter @xmath0 .",
    "our interest in this topic concentrates on the improved calculation of loop corrections for the hadronic matrix elements .",
    "it is well known that the leading-@xmath93 values for the matrix elements underestimate the @xmath5 amplitude @xmath37 in @xmath326 decays .",
    "it has been shown earlier that @xmath2 contributions to the operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 are very large , bringing the value for the amplitude @xmath37 closer to the experimental value  @xcite ; an improved matching condition brings it even closer  @xcite . the same method introduced corrections to the matrix elements of the operators @xmath4 and @xmath44 @xcite and modified the predictions for the parameter @xmath0 .    in view of this knowledge and the fact that three large experiments @xcite were measuring the cp asymmetry",
    ", we decided to embark on an extensive study of the hadronic matrix elements including at the same time improvements of the input parameters which have taken place in the meantime .",
    "in particular , we incorporate an improved estimate of the multiplicative ckm factor  @xcite and use leading and next - to - leading order wilson coefficients , which were communicated to us by m. jamin  @xcite .    in the first part of the paper ( up to section 4 ) we have presented our results to @xmath123 and @xmath43 for the dominant operators @xmath4 and @xmath44  @xcite and have included them in an extensive analysis of the cp parameter .",
    "we have found that the matrix elements @xmath147 and @xmath148 , to this order , have only a logarithmic dependence on the cutoff .",
    "the corrections to these operators are smaller than those of @xmath151 and @xmath327 which are quadratic in the cutoff  @xcite .",
    "they decrease @xmath148 roughly to half its value in the vsa and modify @xmath147 to a lesser extent leading to a ratio @xmath328 .",
    "the net effect is to eliminate the almost complete cancellation between the two operators but the overall values of the matrix elements are reduced .",
    "the corresponding ranges for @xmath10 are given in tabs .",

    "[ epsp1]-[epsp3 ] . adopting central values for the input parameters ( @xmath200 , @xmath205 , @xmath329 , and im@xmath41 ) we obtain @xmath330 .",
    "the quoted range refers to the uncertainties associated with the calculation of the hadronic matrix elements and with the use of three sets of wilson coefficients lo , ndr , and hv . performing a complete scanning of the parameter space we obtain @xmath331 the upper values for @xmath0 obtained in this part of the article are close to the experimental data @xcite .",
    "they are reached only for low values of @xmath200 and specific values for the other parameters . as stated in the article ,",
    "this is the complete first - order calculation for @xmath4 in the twofold expansion and provides a benchmark for additional corrections .",
    "a major part of the present article is the estimate of still higher order effects . in this direction",
    "we have studied , first , the changes introduced by the replacement of the coupling constant @xmath103 by @xmath145 in the next - to - leading order expressions for the matrix elements , which gives an indirect estimate of higher order corrections  @xcite .",
    "we found that the predicted values are increased .",
    "numerical results for central values of @xmath88 and @xmath205 and various values of @xmath200 are shown in fig .",
    "[ epspfk ] , which indicate that the experimental data can be accommodated in the standard model . a low value of @xmath200 is also favoured .",
    "in a second step we studied the @xmath332 corrections for @xmath4 . here",
    "the @xmath124 term vanishes ; the @xmath43 correction was found to be moderate  @xcite .",
    "thus a significant correction appears , for the first time , through quadratic terms of @xmath67 , and the behaviour of @xmath147 is similar to the one found for the matrix elements @xmath151 and @xmath152  @xcite . in section  5",
    "we have shown that the value for @xmath147 is enhanced by the @xmath67 contribution in the chiral limit .",
    "this point we already emphasized in ref .  @xcite .",
    "numerically , we obtain values for @xmath133 around @xmath333 .",
    "our calculation indicates that at the level of the @xmath2 corrections a @xmath5 enhancement is operative for @xmath4 similar to the one of @xmath6 and @xmath7 which dominate the cp conserving amplitude .",
    "the effect of adding the @xmath67 quadratic terms is evident as a substantial increase in the value of @xmath10 , which brings the result rather close to the data for central values of the input parameters .",
    "numerically , this is shown by the following range obtained by collecting together the results for the three sets of wilson coefficients lo , ndr , and hv : @xmath334 ( for details see tab .",
    "[ tab9 ] ) .",
    "performing a complete scanning of the parameter space for the various cases produces the ranges reported in tab .",
    "[ tab10 ] .    as stated in the article , it is still desirable to calculate and compare the full amplitudes to @xmath92 , @xmath67 , and @xmath258",
    ". the incorporation of higher resonances would be very interesting since it would allow to select higher values for the matching scale .",
    "a more sophisticated treatment of the scheme dependence remains a challenge for future studies .",
    "however , it is encouraging that the approximations we made in this paper give results close to the experimental data .",
    "clearly the possibility of an natural explanation , within the standard model , of the experimental value for @xmath0 can not be excluded .    to sum up",
    ", we have presented our results from an extensive study of the hadronic matrix elements to @xmath67 .",
    "we computed all matrix elements in the same theoretical framework , except for @xmath335 which were extracted from the data on the cp conserving decays .",
    "our predictions for @xmath0 are close to the weighted experimental average for central values of the input parameters . + after completion of this article the na48 collaboration at cern reported the value @xmath336",

    "<S> we present a new analysis of the ratio @xmath0 which measures the direct cp violation in @xmath1 decays . </S>",
    "<S> we use the @xmath2 expansion within the framework of the effective chiral lagrangian for pseudoscalar mesons . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 corrections to the hadronic matrix elements of all operators are calculated at leading order in the chiral expansion . performing a simple scanning of the input parameters we obtain @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate , in the chiral limit , the @xmath2 corrections to the operator @xmath4 at next - to - leading order in the chiral expansion . </S>",
    "<S> we find large positive corrections which further enhance @xmath0 and can bring the standard model prediction close to the measured value for central values of the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> our result indicates that at the level of the @xmath2 corrections a @xmath5 enhancement is operative for @xmath4 similar to the one of @xmath6 and @xmath7 which dominate the cp conserving amplitude .        </S>",
