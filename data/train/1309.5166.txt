    "the observed scaling relations between supermassive black hole ( bh ) mass and properties of the host galaxy , intensively studied over the past decade , suggest that black hole growth is tied to the growth of the surrounding host galaxy .",
    "these galaxy properties include the bulge / spheroid stellar velocity dispersion @xmath10 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , which is the rotation velocity measured at large radius to probe the dark matter halos potential .",
    "it is intriguing that these power - law relations , especially the @xmath1 relation , hold over several orders of magnitude in bh mass with small scatter , even though the black hole accounts for only a few thousandths of the mass of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    there are a wide array of theories attempting to explain the bh - galaxy scaling relations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "two of the most popular models include variants of feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and scenarios in which merging alone can lead to bh - galaxy scaling laws . in agn feedback models , the central bh accretes mass and grows until it is massive enough to expel gas from the galaxy potential well and quench its own growth .",
    "bh growth in this picture is regulated by the depth of the galaxy potential well @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the pure merging scenario suggests that the correlation between linear quantities , for example the bh mass @xmath2 and the halo mass @xmath11 , can emerge from a large number of mergers based on the central limit theorem , even without a physical mechanism linking the two @xcite .",
    "although both the feedback and merging phenomena may occur in galaxy evolution , it is unclear whether either of the mechanisms is essential in establishing the scaling relations .",
    "the most important physical scale for feedback is also a matter of debate @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we do not know how the agn output couples to the gas , whether via thermal energy @xcite or momentum @xcite , nor do we know the average efficiency of the feedback .    therefore , empirical evidence that distinguishes the relative importance of different physical processes in establishing the scaling relations is key to constructing the coevolution history of black holes and galaxies . in this paper , we investigate the origin of bh - galaxy scaling relations by comparing the @xmath0 relation to the @xmath1 relation .",
    "circular velocity @xmath3 is a good indicator of dark matter halo mass , and velocity dispersion @xmath10 serves as its counterpart on bulge scales . while some agn feedback scenarios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that bh mass will be most tightly linked to baryons ( as opposed to dark matter ) , a pure merging scenario suggests that the @xmath12 ( or @xmath0 ) relation should be the cleanest and tightest relation , as it is free from the baryonic physics ( e.g. , star formation ) that occurs during merging .",
    "comparison of the two relations , especially their scatter , can help determine the mechanism that drives bh - galaxy coevolution @xcite .",
    "@xcite first proposed that bh mass may correlate with dark matter halo mass , based on the @xmath1 relation and the correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath3 .",
    "later , a number of papers @xcite pointed out that the @xmath13 relation depends on surface brightness , light concentration , and morphology , and suggested that the @xmath1 relation , not the @xmath0 relation , is most fundamental .",
    "@xcite compiled a sample of 25 galaxies with both dynamical bh mass measurements and @xmath3 from spatially resolved rotation curves . from this direct @xmath0 correlation they concluded that the dark matter halo mass alone can not determine the bh mass , given that the bh mass can range from @xmath14  @xmath15  at a circular velocity of @xmath16 ( for a different view see",

    "we start with the most up - to - date galaxy sample with dynamically measured black hole masses , and study all of these that also have spatially resolved circular velocity measurements , predominantly disk galaxies observed with h  i. we present five new h  i  rotation curves measured with the karl g. jansky very large array(vla ) during the expanded very large array ( evla ) construction period .",
    "three of these galaxies have dynamical @xmath2 measured from the kinematics of water megamasers in sub - pc disks @xcite . with bh mass errors smaller than 11 percent , these megamaser measurements are especially useful in constraining the intrinsic scatter of the @xmath0 relations . in total",
    "our sample contains thirty - three galaxies .",
    "we assign @xmath3 to all galaxies in a consistent way and investigate @xmath3 reliability as a function of the spatial extension of the rotation curve . using only reliable @xmath3 measurements at large radius ,",
    "we quantify the @xmath0 correlation and compare it with the @xmath1 relation .",
    "we investigate whether @xmath17  is correlated more tightly with @xmath3 or @xmath10 , to discriminate agn feedback scenarios from those in which merging alone establishes the scaling relations .",
    "we observed 5 spiral galaxies in h  i  with the vla .",
    "the observations were taken in the l - band and the c configuration under project 10b@xmath18220 between october and december 2010 ( for details see table [ tab : obsquality ] ) .",
    "the observations used dual circular polarizations and a single spectral window with 256 channels across the 4mhz ( 852 km  s@xmath19 ) bandwidth , giving a channel width of @xmath20 .",
    "twenty - one edge channels on each side were flagged due to a higher noise level . removing these channels",
    "did not affect our results since none of the sources had emission in these parts of the band .",
    "the full width at half power of the primary beam is @xmath21 , and the synthesized beam size ranges from @xmath22 to @xmath23 depending on the source declination and number of antennas used ( table [ tab : image quality ] ) .",

    "the total number of antennas used was between 22 and 25 , as listed in table [ tab : obsquality ] .",
    "radio frequency interference ( rfi ) was found in three observations , and the contaminated data were excluded , which accounts for only a few percent of the data .",
    "data calibration and image processing were carried out with the common astronomical software applications ( casa ) package .",
    "time averaging of 10 seconds and on - line flagging were applied before calibration .",
    "the amplitude loss due to time averaging is less than 1@xmath28 according to the vla observational status summary .",
    "the antenna position correction , antenna - based delays , bandpass , phase gain , amplitude gain and flux scale calibrations were carried out consecutively . the minimum acceptable signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for the bandpass and gain calibration tables were all set to 3 .",
    "the bandpass solutions were solved for each channel , which gave stable solutions with amplitude variations @xmath29 .",
    "the phase gain and amplitude gain were solved for each calibrator scan .",
    "gain elevation curves were applied to correct for elevation - dependent amplitude gain due to antenna deformation .",
    "data weighting was not used throughout the calibration process , since the vla does not monitor system temperature .",
    "the two polarizations were calibrated separately and combined in the imaging process .    for the emission line analysis ,",
    "the continuum was estimated from line - free channels with more than 20 channels on each side and subtracted in the @xmath30 plane with the task @xmath31 .",
    "a constant continuum level was used for all galaxies but ngc 1194 and ngc 2960 . in these two galaxies ,",
    "an adapted linear spectrum was used in order to subtract a nearby bright source with an inclined spectrum .",
    "the nearby bright continuum sources were well - subtracted at this stage , and the contamination from their side - lobes was negligible .    for imaging we used the casa task @xmath32 in @xmath33 mode .",
    "this mode corrects for the doppler shift due to rotation of the earth . in this process the channels",
    "were also regridded linearly into wider spectral bins - the image planes .",
    "the width of the image planes were chosen to be 10 km  s@xmath19 for higher signal - to - noise ( snr ) observations ( ngc 2748 and ngc 7582 ) , and 20 km  s@xmath19 for lower snr observations ( ngc 1194 , ngc 2960 , and ugc 3789 ) . the snr ratios for each data cube , defined as the peak intensity per channel divided by the rms noise , are listed in table [ tab : image quality ] . for ngc 2748 and ngc 7582 we applied briggs weighting with the parameter _ robust _ set to 0.5 , and natural weighting",
    "was applied for ngc 1194 , ngc 2960 , and ugc 3789 .",
    "all images were cleaned to the 3 @xmath34 level .",
    "all velocities in this paper use the optical convention and the local standard of rest kinematic ( lsrk ) reference frame . position angles ( p.a . ) in this paper are measured east of north .",
    "in this section we describe the procedures that we used to extract velocity fields from the h  i  data cubes and measure rotation curves and @xmath3 .",
    "the properties of individual galaxies are discussed in appendix [ sec : hi_prop ] .",
    "non - parametric integrated intensity moment-0 maps of the five galaxies are shown in the left columns of figures [ fig : ngc2748 ] to [ fig : ugc3789 ] . in order to improve the snr",
    ", we used the casa tool _ image.moments_ , which masked pixels with no signal in producing the moment maps .",
    "the masks were produced as follows : the data cube was first smoothed spatially over one beam and spectrally over two image planes ( @xmath35 for ngc 2748 and ngc 7582 ; @xmath36 for ngc 1194 , ngc 2960 , and ugc 3789 ) .",
    "then , pixels with smoothed intensity below a certain threshold were masked .",
    "the threshold was set to 3  @xmath34 for ngc 2748 , ngc 7582 , and ngc 1194 , and 2.5  @xmath34 for ngc 2960 and ugc 3789 , chosen to optimize the signal seen in the moment-0 maps .      to extract rotation curves from the data cube",
    ", it is conventional to fit a velocity - field model .",
    "the two - dimensional velocity - field model is parametrized by geometrical parameters and the rotation curve . then",
    ", the model is fit to the two - dimensional velocity - field data derived from the 3-d data cube . to construct the velocity field ,",
    "one assigns a representative velocity to each spectrum in the data cube . in the ideal case of a simple rotating disk with small random motions",
    ", the projected rotational velocity will correspond to the peak velocity in the spectrum . in practice",
    "there are different ways to measure the velocity at each position , including the peak velocity , the intensity - weighted mean velocity , and parametrized fitting ( e.g. , gaussian fitting , * ? ? ?",
    "we seek the velocity measure that can best recover the true projected rotation velocity in the case of finite resolution , sensitivity , disk warping and overlapping velocities along the line of sight .",
    "measuring the peak velocity is the most straightforward approach , but the measurement is sensitive to the noise",
    ". it may pick up a noise spike instead of the real signal when the snr is low .",
    "moreover , it is discretized to the velocity channel width , which is 10 or 20 km  s@xmath19 in our case .",
    "the intensity - weighted mean ( moment-1 ) velocity is less sensitive to the noise , but will be biased if the spectrum is not symmetric .",
    "for example , beam smearing will produce a wing towards the systemic velocity , causing the intensity - weighted mean velocity to be skewed towards lower values ( see the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_spec_step ] ) .",
    "another alternative is parametrized fitting , such as with a gaussian line profile .",
    "the gaussian fit picks up the intensity peak if the line profile is symmetric , and it is not as sensitive to the noise as is the peak velocity , so gaussian fitting is our preferred approach .",
    "however , at high snr if the line shape is asymmetric , then the mean velocity of the best - fit gaussian profile will be biased toward the wing ( see the right panel of figure  [ fig : compare_spec_step ] ) . in this case",
    ", we can use a gauss - hermite expansion to capture the non - guassian line shape @xcite .",
    "for example , the skewness asymmetry is taken into account using the third order hermite polynomial @xmath37 @xmath38[1+h_3   \\mathrm{h_3}(x ) ] , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\mathrm{h_3}(x ) & = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}(2\\sqrt{2}x^3 - 3\\sqrt{2}x).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the skewness parameter @xmath39 quantifies the asymmetry of the line shape .",
    "the intensity - weighted mean velocity @xmath40 of this line shape @xmath41 is calculated by @xcite to be @xmath42 to first order .",
    "compared to a gaussian , the mean velocity @xmath40 measured by gauss - hermite fitting is less biased towards the wing and closer to the peak , while compared to the peak velocity the gauss - hermite fit is also less sensitive to the noise .",
    "differences in the velocity fields derived from these different methods and their effects on the resulting rotation curves are discussed in appendix [ sec : app_rc ] .",
    "we find that for high snr data , the rotation curve derived from the moment-1 velocity field is systematically lower than from the gaussian / gauss - hermite velocity field at the @xmath4315@xmath28 level , and that the peak - velocity produces noisy rotation curves for low snr data .",
    "considering the advantages of gaussian and gauss - hermite fitting , we utilized these two methods to construct the velocity field .",
    "in order to minimize contamination from noise , we applied the noise masking described in  [ sec : moment maps ] .",
    "we then performed a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) fitting of a gaussian line shape to the five data cubes .",
    "we assume the likelihood function of intensity is gaussian , and the sigma of this gaussian is a constant throughout the data cube .",
    "the sigma was measured from the rms intensity of line - free channels in the cube .",
    "for the three highest - snr galaxies , i.e. , ngc 2748 , ngc 7582 , and ngc 1194 ( snr @xmath44 14 ) , there were regions along the major axis with high reduced-@xmath45 values , i.e. , where the cumulative distribution function of @xmath45 is larger than 95 percent , indicating deviations of the line shape from a gaussian , mostly because of the line asymmetry described above .",
    "to better capture the skewness of the line , we fitted these high @xmath45 spectra with a third - order gauss - hermite function .",
    "the final velocity fields of ngc 2748 , ngc 7582 , and ngc 1194 were constructed using a mixture of gaussian and gauss - hermite fitting .",
    "the lower snr cubes of ngc 2960 and ugc 3789 ( snr @xmath43 6 ) do not have enough snr to show deviations from single gaussians .",
    "higher - order deviations from the gauss - hermite line shape , such as the fourth - order kurtosis ( @xmath46 ) , still exist in smaller particular regions after using the third - order polynomial ; along the major axis of the edge - on galaxy ngc 1194 the line - of - sight overlap is severe , and along the spiral arms in ngc 7582 the gas kinematics are complex .",
    "we did not apply higher - order fits as the inclusion of the @xmath47 polynomial would not change the mean velocity to the first order @xcite .",
    "one advantage of the mcmc fitting is that the uncertainty in each fitted parameter can be estimated from the standard deviation of the probability distribution probed by the chain .",
    "the uncertainties in the velocities are especially useful",
    ". a large velocity uncertainty may indicate that the spectrum contains no emission line , only noise .",
    "we therefore performed a further masking to exclude pixels with velocity uncertainty larger than 80 km  s@xmath19 .",
    "the final velocity fields are shown in the right columns of figures  [ fig : ngc2748 ] to  [ fig : ugc3789 ] .",
    "rotation curves are derived by fitting the velocity fields (  [ sec : fit vfield ] ) with a rotating disk model .",
    "this model consists of coplanar concentric rings , each with its own rotation velocity .",
    "the width of each ring is chosen to be 14 , corresponding to the typical beam size .",
    "we do not use tilted - ring modeling , but we show in appendix [ sec : app_rc ] that the rotation curves derived with a tilted ring analysis are consistent with those presented here .    the rotation - curve fitting was performed with the same mcmc method .",
    "we assume that the likelihood function of velocity is gaussian , and use the velocity uncertainty estimated in  [ sec : fit vfield ] , such that noisier pixels with larger velocity uncertainties are down - weighted naturally .",
    "we fit five geometrical parameters , the center @xmath48 , @xmath49 , the systemic velocity @xmath50 , the inclination @xmath51 , and the position angle p.a .",
    ", together with the rotation velocity , at each ring .",
    "these parameters describe the velocity - field model . for the megamaser galaxies ( ngc 1194 , ngc 2960 , and ugc 3789 ) we fix the central positions ( @xmath48 ,  @xmath49 ) to the vlbi maser positions , and we fit the kinematic center of ngc 2748 and ngc 7582 as free parameters .",
    "the @xmath50 , @xmath51 , p.a . , and",
    "rotation velocities are fitted as free parameters with the exceptions of the inclination in the case of ngc 2960 and ugc 3789 , and the p.a . of ugc 3789 , where these values can not be constrained by the data .",
    "therefore , we fix these three values to the hyperleda values @xcite , derived from the optical images .",
    "the best - fit geometrical parameters are listed in table  [ tab : best fits ] .",
    "the best - fit rotation curves are plotted in figure [ fig : rc_final ] .",
    "various error sources in the rotation curves are considered , including the fitting errors estimated by the standard deviation in the markov chains , the rms errors estimated by the rms variation of the residuals in a ring , and the errors induced by uncertainties in inclination and p.a .",
    "it is commonly found that the formal fitting errors in the rotation curve fits are unrealistically small ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , likely because the rotating disk model fails to capture features in the observed velocity field such that the residuals are non - gaussian , causing the fitting errors to appear artificially small ( 5 - 20 times smaller than the rms error ) .",
    "as shown in appendix [ sec : app_rc ] , the rms error is larger than or comparable to the differences between various velocity assignment methods and different parameterized rotating disk models , and therefore provides a conservative estimate of the potential systematic uncertainties . for ngc 2960 and ugc 3789 , we also include the uncertainties in the literature inclination and/or p.a . values .",
    "the uncertainties contributed by these values are estimated by recalculating the rotation velocities assuming an inclination and/or p.a . within @xmath52 of the hyperleda value .",
    "the final error is the quadratic addition of the considered error sources .",
    "our primary sample is an updated list of galaxies with both dynamical @xmath2 and spatially resolved @xmath3 measurements , as tabulated in table [ tab : vcreliability ] and [ tab : mbhvc ] .",
    "there have been a number of compilations of @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite ; we introduce a few significant improvements over these .",
    "first , we update five maser and three stellar / gas dynamical @xmath2 measurements .",
    "in addition to our five vla h  i  rotation curve @xmath3 measurements , there are a few other @xmath3 measurements included in this sample from the literature that are not compiled in previous @xmath0 studies .",
    "we also reexamine the literature @xmath3 values with a careful reliability analysis , to ensure that our measurements and the literature values are derived in a consistent manner .",
    "thus , our @xmath3 values may differ from previous work .",
    "in addition to this primary sample , we also consider a secondary sample composed of galaxies with three spatially unresolved @xmath3 ( single dish h  i  measurements ) and fifteen black hole mass upper limits .",
    "this secondary sample is described in appendix [ sec : app_sec ] and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mbhvc ] for comparison , but is not used in our scaling relation fitting analysis .",
    "table [ tab : vcreliability ] lists the @xmath3 values , sources , and rotation - curve properties of our primary sample .",
    "we examined each rotation curve from the original literature to assign a @xmath3 value . because @xmath3 is used as a tracer of the dark matter halo potential in the outer parts of the galaxy , we assign @xmath3 as the rotation velocity at the largest observed radius @xmath53 , which is consistent with the definition in @xcite .",
    "if the inclination correction is applied in the original literature , we use this inclination - corrected rotational velocity , otherwise we apply a simple @xmath54 inclination correction using the optically determined inclination from hyperleda @xcite . the uncertainty in @xmath3 that results from our inclination correction treatment is estimated to be less than @xmath55 for a typical inclination error of @xmath52 in the optically derived inclination ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) at an average inclination of @xmath56 .",
    "this is comparable to or smaller than the @xmath3 measurement errors described below .",
    "the observational error in @xmath3 , listed first , is taken from the original literature .",
    "if it is not presented then we assume a @xmath57 observational error , which is typical among our sample .",
    "the second error stands for the uncertainties due to rotation curve variation . in the ideal case where the rotation curve is flat at large radius",
    ", there is one uniquely defined @xmath3 .",
    "however , if the rotation curve is not flat but keeps rising or starts to fall , then @xmath3 depends on where the outermost observed radius @xmath53 is located . to take this uncertainty into account , we assign a second error equivalent to the amplitude of variation in the rotation curve . while these error assignments may overestimate the real error between the observed @xmath3 and the true halo potential , we hope to avoid overestimating the intrinsic scatter @xmath58 in the @xmath0 relation . the final error used in the @xmath0 relation fit",
    "is taken as the larger of the observational and rotation curve variation error , as listed in table [ tab : mbhvc ] .",
    "there are two galaxies , ngc 3998 and ngc 5128 ( centaurus a ) in our primary sample that have no rotation curve measurements but have spatially resolved h  i  data . for ngc 3998",
    "we adopt the @xmath3 value and observational error estimated by the original literature @xcite . for ngc 5128 , we determine @xmath3 using the published p - v diagram , and apply an inclination correction using the inclination from hyperleda @xcite . to reflect our lack of knowledge about the rotation curve trends , we assign conservative rotation curve variation errors of @xmath59 in these two cases .",
    "how faithfully @xmath3 reflects the potential of the dark matter halo depends on whether the rotation curve is probing the halo - dominated part of the galaxy .",
    "therefore we compare the outermost observed radius of the rotation curve @xmath53 with the optically determined @xmath60 , which is the @xmath61 mag arcsec@xmath62 isophote from rc2 @xcite shown in column ( 6 ) of table [ tab : vcreliability ] . it is worth noting that if @xmath63 is small , as in the case of many optical rotation curves , then the rotation curve may be dominated by baryons rather than the dark matter halo , in turn biasing our measurement of intrinsic scatter in the @xmath0 relation .",
    "thus , we divide galaxies into four groups according to the spatial extent and shape of their rotation curves .",
    "the first group has the largest spatial extent ( @xmath64 ) , followed by the second group ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the third and fourth groups both have short rotation curves ( @xmath66 ) , but in the third group the rotation curves flatten while those ones in the fourth group are still rising until the last bin .",
    "we discuss the reliability of the @xmath3 measurements for these groups in  [ sec : fit_results ] and will conclude that only the first two groups ( @xmath67 ) have reliable @xmath3 for our @xmath0 analysis .",
    "table [ tab : mbhvc ] lists @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath10 and other galaxy quantities .",
    "the black hole mass @xmath2 , stellar velocity dispersion @xmath10 , morphology , and distance are adopted from @xcite , except for ngc 4526 @xcite .",
    "the method of @xmath2 measurement is also listed .",
    "we note potential caveats in the @xmath2 measurements of three galaxies as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured the black hole mass in ngc 1068 and found a non - keplerian maser disk . for ngc 2748",
    ", @xcite cautions that the determination of the disk center may be affected by heavy extinction .",
    "finally , the black hole mass in ngc 7457 as measured by @xcite could be overestimated if the central bright source excluded in their dynamical modeling is a nuclear cluster instead of an agn . while we keep these three galaxies in our sample , we note these points of caution .",
    "the @xmath10 that we adopt from @xcite is the light - weighted stellar velocity dispersion within one effective radius .",
    "however , for some galaxies the @xmath10 is lower than in previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as the bh sphere of influence is excluded in the velocity integration to avoid contamination .",
    "ngc 3998 and ngc 4594 in our primary sample , as well as ngc 1399 and ngc 4486 in our secondary sample , have @xmath10 updated by @xcite with this correction .",
    "we also note that there is a new distance update from megamaser measurements for ugc 3789 @xcite , but we adopt the distance in @xcite , which is consistent with @xcite .",
    "to quantitatively analyze the @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations , we fit each scaling relation with a power - law functional form @xmath68 here @xmath69 is the intercept and @xmath70 is the logarithmic slope of the relation",
    ". we use @xmath71 to compare with @xmath3 , motivated by the widely used singular isothermal sphere model where @xmath72 .",
    "observationally @xcite also found an almost linear relation between @xmath3 and @xmath34 with a ratio close to @xmath73 .",
    "we use a maximum - likelihood fitting method similar to @xcite that takes intrinsic ( or cosmic ) scatter @xmath58 into account , with modifications regarding the @xmath3 error treatment . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the probability distribution of both the observational errors and intrinsic scatter are normal in log space , and all the observational errors are symmetrized in log space before fitting . here",
    "we denote @xmath74 and the normalized gaussian error distribution to be @xmath75 with mean zero and standard deviation @xmath76 .",
    "to take the error in the independent variable ( @xmath3 and @xmath10 in this case ) into account , we have an error term @xmath77 in the likelihood function .",
    "we write the likelihood for observing one galaxy ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) given an intrinsic scaling relation @xmath80 with intrinsic scatter @xmath58 to be @xmath81 this treatment of the errors in the independent variable is less computationally expensive than the monte carlo method used in @xcite .",
    "we then maximize the total likelihood @xmath82 to get the best - fit scaling relation parameters , the intercept @xmath69 , the slope @xmath70 , and the intrinsic scatter @xmath58 .",
    "this maximum - likelihood method is similar to the minimum @xmath83-square method described in @xcite , except for the @xmath84 normalization factor of the gaussian function . we adopt the @xmath85 confidence limit as an error estimate for the fitted parameters @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath58 .",

    "if our sample is subject to selection effects , it may not represent the true distribution of objects .",
    "selection effects may exist for both bh and circular velocity measurements .",
    "first , it has been argued that analysis excluding @xmath2 upper limits might be biased toward more massive bhs at a given velocity dispersion , especially for late - type galaxies , since only massive bhs have a sphere of influence large enough to be spatially resolved @xcite .",

    "* ) . while selection biases in @xmath3 measurements also exist",
    ", at least there is no obvious bias on the intrinsic scatter inherent with these selections .",
    "if we wish to interpret the @xmath0 relation as a reflection of the underlying @xmath12 relation , then scatter may be introduced in the conversion from @xmath3 to @xmath11 . to estimate the magnitude of this scatter ,",
    "we take the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) model as an example .",
    "this model is a mass profile that is parametrized by the inner density @xmath120 and the characteristic inner radius @xmath121 , or equivalently the virial mass @xmath122 and the concentration @xmath123 .",
    "the virial radius @xmath124 is defined as the radius within which the averaged halo density exceeds the background density by a certain factor , the virial mass @xmath122 is the mass enclosed within @xmath124 , and the virial velocity @xmath125 is the rotation velocity at @xmath124 . because there is a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath122 and @xmath125 , the main uncertainty actually comes from the conversion between @xmath125 at the virial radius ( typically a few hundred kpc ) and @xmath3 at the observed radius ( typically 10 - 20 kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "the observed @xmath3 is close to the maximum velocity @xmath126 occurring at radius @xmath127 , which is a few to a few tens of kpc .",
    "the ratio @xmath128 depends on @xmath129 @xmath130 the scatter in concentration is estimated by @xcite and corrected by @xcite to be @xmath131 dex , which translates to an error of 0.035 dex in @xmath126 or 0.14 dex in @xmath2 for a slope of @xmath132 in the @xmath0 relation .",
    "there is also a weak dependence of concentration on the virial mass , which affects the slope of the @xmath0 relation in principle .    additionally , if the halo is not spherically symmetric , as assumed by the nfw profile , but is prolate or triaxial , there will be extra uncertainty in the @xmath117 conversion .",
    "@xcite estimate that the low observed scatter in the tully - fisher relation constrains the ellipticity of the halo potential in the disk plane to be @xmath133 .",
    "triaxiality can at most contribute a scatter of 0.026 dex in @xmath3 or 0.1 dex in @xmath2 in the @xmath0 relation .    removing these additional sources of uncertainty in quadrature , assuming that they are uncorrelated , changes the final intrinsic scatter very little ( 0.48 rather than 0.51 ) .",
    "thus we conclude that those sources of scatter are small compare to outstanding measurement uncertainty .",
    "we will now consider the implications of our new fits for the evolution of bhs and galaxies . in  [ subsec : feebackormerging ] , we hope to gain new insight into whether agn feedback is required to explain the bh - bulge scaling relations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , or whether galaxy merging alone may lead to tight bh - bulge correlations in massive galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in ",
    "[ sec : upper - limits ] we discuss the implications of @xmath2 upper limits as outliers in the @xmath0 relation .",
    "we address the relative importance of feedback and merging empirically by asking which can account for features in the observed @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations .",
    "we start by reviewing the expected slope , outlier behavior , and intrinsic scatter of the scaling relations in the context of each scenario .",
    "we will find that while more theoretical guidance and a larger sample size are needed to make inferences from the outliers and slope measurements , the intrinsic scatter is already an available and useful discriminant between the two scenarios .    in the galaxy merging scenario @xcite",
    ", the correlations between @xmath2 and galactic quantities ( e.g. , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 ) emerge from a large number of mergers simply by the central limit theorem , even without a physical mechanism linking the two . in the context of this scenario , we expect the following features of the scaling relations . first , as the number of mergers increases and the galaxies grow larger , the scatter between @xmath2 and galaxy properties will decrease and the distribution will converge to a tighter correlation . therefore , it is expected that the intrinsic scatter @xmath137 will decrease as the number of mergers increases towards larger @xmath3 and @xmath10 .",
    "outliers , with bh masses deviating from a power - law scaling relation , become increasingly unlikely towards higher masses .",
    "second , the logarithmic slope @xmath70 of the correlation between two linear quantities , e.g. , @xmath2 and @xmath136 , should be close to unity if the impact of growth via accretion for any component is small .",
    "in other words , the average ratio @xmath138 should be similar across all masses .",
    "if we translate this slope to the @xmath0 relation , assuming @xmath139 @xcite , we should find the slope of the @xmath0 relation , @xmath70 , to be close to @xmath140 , somewhat smaller than , but allowed by , our observations .",
    "lastly , the @xmath141 relation should be tighter than other scaling relations , e.g. , the @xmath142 or @xmath143 relations , because @xmath136 simply adds during merging and does not depend on the baryonic physics that @xmath144 and @xmath135 are subject to .",
    "for example , during merging , extra factors of star formation and disk to bulge conversion have to be considered for the evolution of @xmath135 , and this will make the scatter in the @xmath143 relation larger than that in the @xmath141 relation , if the baryonic regulation mechanism is not present .",
    "however , we note that diffuse dm accretion in principle may also enhance the scatter in @xmath136 .",
    "feedback , on the other hand , provides a physical mechanism that couples bh mass directly with the galaxy potential well ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if the bh is massive enough , its energy or momentum output can expel gas from its vicinity and quench the further growth of both the bh and the galaxy .",
    "this feedback loop sets an upper limit on the bh mass for a given potential well depth , measured by the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath10 of the bulge or @xmath3 of the dark matter halo .",
    "however , it is unclear whether this self - regulation process takes place on the scale of the bh sphere of influence , the bulge @xcite , or the dark matter halo @xcite .",
    "some predictions of the feedback scenario are as follows .",
    "first , the scaling relations form an upper boundary for @xmath2 .",
    "the bh can not grow above the relation via accretion ( although over - massive bhs could already be in place from massive seeds @xcite ) .",
    "second , the slope of the @xmath1 or the @xmath0 relation is predicted to be five for energy feedback @xcite and four for momentum feedback @xcite .",
    "third , the correlation between bh mass and the potential indicator ( @xmath10 or @xmath3 ) on the feedback scale should be tighter than on other scales .",
    "we here compare the statistics of our @xmath3 sample with the predictions discussed above regarding the outlier properties , slope , and the intrinsic scatter , respectively .",
    "there are no obvious outliers above the @xmath0 relation in our sample , possibly due to limited sample size",
    ". however , there are bulgeless galaxies with @xmath2 upper - limits that are low compared to their @xmath3 , which will be further discussed in  [ sec : upper - limits ] . regarding the measured slopes , with such limited dynamic range our data are still inadequate to discriminate the two scenarios .",
    "both scenarios are consistent with the wide range of allowed @xmath0 slopes ( @xmath70 = 2.48 - 4.91 ) .",
    "however , the comparison of intrinsic scatter between the two relations can provide useful constraints on the origin of the scaling relations .",
    "our measurements show that the scatter in the @xmath0 relation is similar to that in the @xmath1 relation , within the errors .",
    "it is worth noticing that the intrinsic scatter in @xmath0 , @xmath145 dex , is a conservatively low estimate , as we have assigned large errors to the @xmath3 measurements to account for various observational uncertainties , including inclination uncertainties and rotation curve variations .",
    "even so , we still find a value that is consistent with our measured @xmath1 scatter , @xmath100 dex , and that is not smaller than the @xmath1 intrinsic scatter @xmath146 for late - type galaxies constrained by @xcite or @xmath102 for the entire sample in @xcite .",
    "we find no evidence that the @xmath0 ( or @xmath12 ) relation is significantly tighter than the @xmath1 relation , in contradiction with naive expectations from the pure merging scenario .",
    "therefore , our result disfavors merging as the only mechanism that ties together bhs and galaxies . note that we use @xmath10 to trace the baryonic mass in the bulge , while @xcite looked at the @xmath147 relation instead .",
    "unfortunately , observations of @xmath148 for lower - mass galaxies with dynamical @xmath2 are scarce , so a direct comparison between @xmath149 and @xmath147 is not yet possible .",
    "if the real scatter in the @xmath147 relation is even smaller than in @xmath1 , our conclusion is stronger .",
    "even if the scatter in the @xmath147 relation turns out to be larger than in the @xmath1 relation , the fact that the scatter in the @xmath0 relation is no smaller than that in the @xmath1 relation still requires ( baryonic ) mechanisms beyond the pure merging scenario .    on the other hand , if agn feedback is important in regulating bh growth , and it acts primarily on the bulge scale @xcite , the smaller intrinsic scatter in the @xmath1 relation could be explained .",
    "we speculate that on top of the correlations formed by merging , feedback further regulates the bh mass according to the bulge potential @xmath10 , tightens the @xmath1 relation ( not the @xmath0 relation ) , and decreases the intrinsic scatter in a relative sense .",
    "alternatively , other baryonic mechanisms that connect the bh to the bulge , e.g. , via feeding of bulge stars onto the accretion disk @xcite , or star formation - regulated bh growth @xcite , could also contribute to the tighter @xmath1 relation .",
    "@xmath2 upper limits in bulgeless galaxies have also been used to differentiate the dependence of black hole mass on galaxy halos or bulges .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath2 can not be uniquely determined by @xmath3 .",
    "bulgeless galaxies have low ( or zero ) @xmath17   and low @xmath86  but relatively high @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , @xmath86   is a better predictor of @xmath17  than is @xmath3 for these galaxies .",
    "we expand the sample of bulgeless galaxies with @xmath2 upper limits by including the measurements from @xcite in our secondary sample .",

    "as can be seen from figure [ fig : mbhvc ] , there are a few upper limits lying below the @xmath0 relation but not the @xmath1 relation . with a larger number of galaxies ,",
    "we confirm kormendy s statement that the halo mass alone does not determine the black hole mass .",
    "however , it is also possible that these bulgeless galaxies do not host a massive black hole at all .",
    "the presence or absence of a bh seed may involve different physical mechanisms than those that couple bhs to galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in any case , the upper limits strengthen our conclusion that bulge scales matter , likely both in seeding and in bh growth with cosmic time .",
    "we refine the measured @xmath0 relation and compare it to the @xmath1 relation to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive bh scaling relations .",
    "we perform vla observations to measure the circular velocities @xmath3 for five galaxies with dynamical @xmath2 . together with a thorough literature search",
    ", we increase the sample size of galaxies with both @xmath2 and @xmath3 measurements to thirty - three .",
    "twenty - two of these have @xmath3 evaluated at large enough radius ( @xmath150 ) to be reliable for our scientific purpose .    with this sample ,",
    "we constrain the power - law @xmath0 relation to have an intercept @xmath92 , slope @xmath151 , and intrinsic scatter @xmath7 .",
    "the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath0 relation is not significantly smaller than that in the @xmath1 relation , showing that @xmath17  does not correlate better with dark matter halo mass than with bulge properties .",
    "this contradicts naive expectations from pure merging scenarios .",
    "furthermore , we consider a number of @xmath2 upper limits in bulgeless galaxies that lie significantly below the @xmath0 relation , suggesting that bh masses are better predicted by the bulge , not the halo , either via its seeding or accreting mechanism .",
    "we thus suggest that pure merging is not likely to be the only mechanism that drives the scaling relations .",
    "agn feedback may also be an essential ingredient to tighten the correlation between bh mass and bulge properties .",
    "we highlight possible future improvements to this work .",
    "first , modeling of the dark matter halo mass distribution , to separate the halo mass from the baryons using both rotation curves and light distributions , can improve the halo mass estimation and better constrain the @xmath12 relation .",
    "second , @xmath3 measured by stellar dynamical modeling for elliptical galaxies , if proven to be comparable to those from h  i  rotation curves , can improve the dynamic range and better constrain the slope of the relation .",
    "third , quantitative theoretical predictions for the scaling relations , especially the intrinsic scatter , from both feedback and pure merging scenarios , will enable more direct comparisons with the empirical relations .",

    "previous d - array vla observations @xcite are consistent with the spatial extent and velocity from our data , but their h  i  flux of @xmath193 is lower than ours .",
    "this is understandable as their flux was calculated from the moment-0 map and should be lower than from the data cube .",
    "our h  i  data also provides images of the radio continuum at 20 cm .",
    "we find that the radio continuum of ngc 2960 is slightly extended , suggesting that there is a radio jet launched from the central black hole ( fig .",

    "the continuum image is made from line - free channels on both sides of the h  i  line with a total velocity range of 300 @xmath194 , and is cleaned to the @xmath195 level using @xmath196 weighting .",
    "we measure the size and position angle of the jet using two different methods .",
    "first , we fit a central point source ( @xmath197 ) and subtract it .",
    "we detect residual emission to the south - east . taking into account the positional uncertainty due to the finite beamsize , this extended emission is @xmath198 away from the center at a position angle of @xmath199 .",

    "in this section we investigate two complications that may affect rotation curve estimation .",
    "first , we consider differences in rotation curves arising from different methods of assigning velocity .",
    "second , we look at tilted ring modeling , which captures warps in the rotation disk , to see if our circular velocities are changed .    as discussed in  [ sec : fit vfield ] , there are various methods to assign velocity to a spectrum , e.g. , the peak velocity , the intensity - weighted mean ( moment-1 ) , or gaussian / gauss - hermite velocities .",
    "the first two methods have some drawbacks .",
    "the peak velocity is sensitive to the noise in the data , and is discretized to the channel width of the data cube , and the moment-1 velocity is biased towards the wing if the spectral line is asymmetric .",
    "our preferred method is therefore the gaussian / gauss - hermite fit .",
    "the averaged difference between the gaussian / gauss - hermite and the peak velocity ( moment-1 ) velocity field is 17 ( 18 ) km  s@xmath19   for the high snr galaxies ( ngc 2748 , ngc 7582 , and ngc 1194 ) and 37 ( 33 ) km  s@xmath19   for low snr galaxies ( ngc 2960 and ugc 3789 ) .",
    "we now propagate these different velocity assignments to investigate the differences in our inferred rotation curves .",
    "we focus on two representative galaxies , ngc 7582 ( high snr = 23 ) and ngc 2960 ( low snr = 6 ) .",
    "we use the same mcmc procedure as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : fit rc ] , assuming a homogeneous error in the velocity field of 20 km  s@xmath19   for ngc 7582 and 40 km  s@xmath19   for ngc 2960 , and applying the same masking as in the gaussian / gauss - hermite velocity field to mask out noisy pixels .",
    "the fitted rotation curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_rc ] .",
    "the average differences between gaussian / gauss - hermite and the peak velocity ( moment-1 ) rotation curves are 11 ( 23 ) km  s@xmath19   for ngc 7582 and 67 ( 39 ) km  s@xmath19   for ngc 2960 . compared to the rms errors of the gaussian / gauss - hermite rotation curves , which are 24 km  s@xmath19   for ngc 7582 and 37 km  s@xmath19   for ngc 2960 , we found that : first , the peak velocity rotation curve of ngc 7582 is consistent with the gaussian / gauss - hermite rotation curve within the error .",
    "however , the peak velocity rotation curve deviates from the gaussian significantly for the lower snr galaxy ngc 2960 .",
    "these tests confirm our concern that the peak velocity is highly sensitive to noise and is not suitable for estimating the rotation curves for low snr data . also , ngc 7582 has a moment-1derived rotation curve that is systematically lower than the gaussian / gauss - hermite one , with a deviation comparable to the rms error .",
    "this is consistent with our expectation that the moment-1 velocity is biased by the wing of the spectral line .",
    "moment-1 velocities usually underestimate the rotation velocity for high snr data , due to beam smearing and higher intensity at the inner part of the galaxy .",
    "this bias was also demonstrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_spec_step ] .",
    "ngc 2690 has a moment-1 rotation curve that differs from the gaussian rotation curve at a level that is comparable to the rms errors as well . in this case",
    "we see no systematic bias , possibly because the snr is not high enough to manifest an asymmetric line shape . considering these effects ,",
    "we find that the gaussian / gauss - hermite method is relatively reliable in the face of asymmetric line shapes and noisy data .    in  [ sec : fit rc ] we adopt a coplanar disk model for rotation curve fitting .",
    "however , this model does not capture the asymmetry in the velocity field that arises from warping of the disk , as seen in ngc 2748 and ngc 7582 .",
    "here we assess whether these asymmetries have an effect on our @xmath3 estimates .",
    "we take our most asymmetric galaxy ngc 7582 as an example , and use the _ kinemetry _ method @xcite to fit a tilted - ring model . in this model , the position angle and the inclination of each ring are allowed to vary . furthermore ,",
    "second and third order harmonic terms , e.g. , @xmath213 and @xmath214 , are included to capture higher frequency variations along each ring .",
    "the best - fit models are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tr_model ] with their residuals , and the fitted rotation curves are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tr_rc ] .",
    "the tilted - ring model better captures warps in the disk and reduces the residuals , but the best - fit rotation velocities stay unchanged within the uncertainties .",
    "the difference at the outer - most bin is less than @xmath215 of the rms error .",
    "this demonstrates the robustness of the rotation curve fitting against warps and higher order variations of the velocity field , and shows that the rms error is a conservative estimate of the potential systematics in the rotation curve fitting .",
    "in our secondary sample we have three galaxies ( ngc 3368 , ngc 3393 , ngc 3489 ) with dynamical @xmath2 but no available rotation curves .",
    "however , @xmath3 can also be inferred from the line width of integrated h  i  spectra taken with single dish radio observations ( @xmath216 ) , and the single dish @xmath3 for these three galaxies from hyperleda @xcite are listed in table [ tab : vcreliability_secondary ] .",
    "since single - dish measurements are more readily available for large samples , they have been used in previous scaling - relation studies @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite find that @xmath217 is a robust substitute for @xmath218 . on the other hand , without spatial information , single - dish circular velocities may contain large uncertainties due to the distribution of atomic gas , irregular rotation - curve shape , or contamination from companion galaxies .",
    "in general , the values may skew towards lower values , since single - dish measurements are biased to the inner part of the rotation curve .    to understand how much @xmath219 can deviate from @xmath218 ,",
    "we compare the two numbers for all galaxies in our sample that have both measurements ( figure [ fig : vcsd - vcrc ] ) . for most of the galaxies , @xmath219 is consistent with @xmath218 .",
    "however for a few of them the two numbers can deviate by up to a factor of two .",
    "these are preferentially s0 galaxies , suggesting that in these cases low gas fractions are skewing the @xmath219 values low . on the other hand , there are only three galaxies in our sample that only have single - dish h  i  measurements . in practice , including or excluding these three galaxies from our fitting does not change the result .",
    "we decide not to include them in our primary sample .",
