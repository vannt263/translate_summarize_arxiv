    "many extensions of the standard model leads to flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) naturally .",
    "it is the case of models with an extended higgs sector .",
    "however , owing to the high suppression imposed by experiments , several mechanisms has been used to get rid of them , such as discrete symmetries @xcite , permutation symmetries @xcite , and different textures of yukawa couplings @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , the increasing evidence on neutrino oscillations seems to show the existence of mass terms for the neutrinos as well as of family lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) fukuda .",
    "such fact has inspired the study of many scenarios that predict lfv processes as in the case of susy theories with r- parity broken @xcite , su(5 ) susy models with right - handed neutrinos @xcite , models with heavy majorana neutrinos @xcite , and multi - higgs doublet models with right - handed neutrinos for each lepton generation @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , lfv in the charged sector has been also examined in models such as susy gut @xcite , and the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) @xcite .",
    "experimental upper limits for the branching ratios of these processes have been obtained from several collaborations , in the case of the charged lepton sector , searches for them have been carried out through leptonic and semileptonic decays of @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons @xcite , as well as purely leptonic processes @xcite . on the other hand , some collaborations plan to improve current upper limits of some lfv decays by several orders of magnitude , by increasing the statistics @xcite .",
    "other possible sources of improvement lies on the fermilab tevatron and lhc by means of lfv higgs boson decays .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the flavor changing mode @xmath3 in the context of mssm and of an @xmath4-inspired multi - higgs model with an abelian flavor symmetry ; can be sizable at the cern - lhc and the fermilab - tevatron .    further , one of the most promising source to look for higgs mediated flavor changing neutral currents , lies on the muon colliders .",
    "it is because they have the potentiality to produce higgs bosons in the @xmath5channel , with substantial rate production at the higgs mass resonance @xcite .",
    "some of the main advantages of muon colliders consists of its negligible synchrotron radiation and brehmstrahlung , as well as the small beam energy spread @xcite . from the theoretical point of view , since higgs yukawa couplings are usually proportional to the lepton mass , they give an important enhancement to cross sections with higgs mediated @xmath5channels , respect to the ones in an @xmath6 collider .",
    "the small spread in the center of mass energy would permit a precision measurements of narrow resonances , that in turn allow a good determination of the higgs mass and higgs decay width .",
    "in particular , for the process @xmath7 , ref . @xcite have found that in the context of the 2hdm iii , hundreds of such events are expected if @xmath8 gev with a total integrated luminosity of @xmath9 over a negligible background , providing useful information about the @xmath10 mixing . besides , ref .",
    "@xcite also found that the process @xmath11 could be observable as well , though only some few events are expected .",
    "notwithstanding , for higgs boson masses above the @xmath12 threshold ( @xmath13 gev ) the opening of these new channels decrease dramatically the production of such fcnc decays .    in a recent previous work @xcite",
    ", some constraints on lfv have been found in the framework of the two higgs doublet model with flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "specifically , bounds on the vertices @xmath14,@xmath15 , where obtained based on the @xmath16 muon factor and the leptonic decays @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "additionally , upper limits on the decays @xmath19 and @xmath20 were estimated , finding them to be highly suppressed respect to the present experimental sensitivity .",
    "the purpose of this work is to complete the information about the spectrum of the lfv matrix . with this in mind , we shall use the leptonic processes @xmath21 and @xmath22 as the inputs for our constraints .",
    "we shall work in the context of the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) with flavor changing neutral currents , the so called model type iii .",
    "the lepton vertices are described by the following yukawa lagrangian@xmath23 e\\left ( \\cos \\alpha h^{0}-\\sin \\alpha h^{0}\\right )   \\notag \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\overline{e}\\xi ^{e}e\\left ( \\sin \\alpha h^{0}+\\cos \\alpha h^{0}\\right )   \\notag \\\\ & & + \\overline{\\vartheta } \\xi ^{e}p_{r}eh^{+}+\\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}\\overline{e}% \\xi ^{e}\\gamma _ { 5}ea^{0}+h.c .",

    "we use the parametrization in which one of the vacuum expectation value vanishes .",

    "@xmath36we neglect the diagrams containing the vertex @xmath37 and keep only the ones proportional to @xmath38 , we make this approximation because previous phenomenological analysis shows a strong hierarchy between these mixing vertices @xcite ( @xmath39 by at least five orders of magnitude ) .        in a previous work @xcite ,",
    "the lfv vertices coming from the 2hdm type iii , were constrained by using several pure leptonic processes , the following bounds for the lfv vertices were found@xmath43such constraints are valid in most of the region of parameters . since we intend to complete the analysis made in @xcite , we shall make the same assumptions which we summarize here for completeness .",
    "we settle @xmath44gev , and @xmath45 . in order to cover a very wide region of parameters ,",
    "we examine five cases for the remaining free parameters of the model @xcite        the vertex @xmath53 can be constrained by combining the existing limits on @xmath54 given in eqs .",
    "( [ bounds ] ) , and the upper limit on the decay width @xmath55 given by eq .",
    "( [ expbounds ] ) .",
    "alternatively , we can constrain the same vertex from the decay @xmath56 . the upper limits on @xmath53 obtained from both decays",
    "are illustrated in table ( [ tab : mue ] ) for the five cases explained above .",
    "we have found constraints on the whole spectrum of the mixing matrix of leptons , by using purely leptonic processes .",
    "gathering the information of all the contraints for lfv vertices , we get the following bounds@xmath60 in which a strong hierarchy between the vertices @xmath38 and @xmath61 is manifest . additionally , we get predictions for some leptonic decays shown in table ( [ tab : pred ] ) , in which we also include the experimental upper limit for the sake of comparison . from table tab : pred , we see that such decays are highly suppressed respect to the current instrumental sensitivity .",
    "it owes mainly to its dependence on the @xmath37 vertex which is much more restricted than the others .",
