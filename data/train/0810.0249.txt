    "charmless hadronic @xmath0-meson decays provide us with important information on the physics of flavour , within and beyond the standard model .",
    "after the very successful first generation of @xmath0-factory experiments , babar and belle , the interest in this field is re - inforced by the upcoming start of the lhc with the dedicated lhcb experiment @xcite . in the longer",
    "run the second generation @xmath0-factory projects superb @xcite and superkekb @xcite promise excellent future opportunities @xcite , as well as the lhcb upgrade options @xcite .    in the present paper we investigate in detail the class of hadronic two - body decays of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 mesons with longitudinally polarized light vector mesons ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) in the final state .",
    "these can be computed systematically using qcd factorization in the heavy - quark limit @xcite . in comparison",
    ", @xmath0 decays into vector mesons with transverse polarization are suppressed by powers of @xmath22 .",
    "their amplitudes do not factorize , as indicated by infrared singularities in convolution integrals , and this introduces a model - dependence in the computation of the related observables @xcite .",
    "for this reason we do not include final states with transversely polarized vector mesons in our present analysis , although they raise issues of interest in their own right @xcite .",
    "rather , we will pursue the physics of @xmath10 decays , which comprise 28 calculable channels and 6 annihilation modes within the standard model and offer a rich phenomenology by themselves .",
    "the various decay modes probe different types of amplitudes , such as tree , qcd and electroweak penguin , or weak annihilation",
    ". the large number of channels will allow us to test our understanding of qcd in hadronic @xmath0 decays and at the same time to extract flavour parameters and search for new physics effects .",
    "an important motivation for the study of final states with two vector mesons is the considerably smaller size of qcd penguin contributions , as compared to the decay into pseudoscalars .",
    "this improves our control of qcd effects in several observables of interest for flavour physics .",
    "mixing - induced cp violation in @xmath6 is an important example .",
    "several studies of @xmath23 decays based on factorization in the heavy - quark limit have been made in the literature .",
    "so far the only comprehensive analysis , including all channels , has been given in @xcite , where also transverse polarization is discussed .",
    "the other articles have addressed various aspects of @xmath23 decays , investigating particular channels , polarization effects and , in part , new physics contributions .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed analysis of the complete set of @xmath24 decays within the standard model .",
    "we work to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in qcd , using factorization in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "power corrections to this limit , in particular from weak annihilation , are estimated using a model description @xcite .",
    "our presentation includes some additional aspects and several new applications of @xmath24 transitions .",
    "we give detailed analytical expressions for all 34 @xmath24 decay amplitudes at next - to - leading order .",
    "we suggest an alternative treatment of long - distance electromagnetic penguins , which contribute in channels with the neutral vector mesons @xmath18 , @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "the effects of @xmath2-@xmath3 mixing are briefly discussed .",
    "we apply the results in new ways to the phenomenology of the unitarity triangle : we use the formulation of @xcite for the analysis of cp violation in @xmath6 , we propose an approach to independently constrain the @xmath6-penguin with @xmath5 and v - spin symmetry , and we extract accurate values of the ckm quantities @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    the paper is organized as follows .",
