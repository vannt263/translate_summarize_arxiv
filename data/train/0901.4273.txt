    "<S> the mean kinetic energy of protons in water is determined by deep inelastic neutron scattering experiments , performed above and below the temperature of maximum density and in the supercooled phase . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of this energy shows an anomalous behavior , as it occurs for many water properties . in particular two regions of maximum kinetic energy </S>",
    "<S> are identified : the first one , in the supercooled phase in the range 269 k - 272 k , and a second one above 273 k. in both these regions the measured proton kinetic energy exceedes the theoretical prediction based on a semi - classical model . </S>",
    "<S> noteworthy , the proton mean kinetic energy has a maximum at 277 k , the temperature of the maximum density of water . in the supercooled metastable phase the measured mean kinetic energy and the proton momentum distribution clearly indicate proton delocalization between two h - bonded oxygens .    among liquids , </S>",
    "<S> water is undoubtely the most studied , as it is the medium of life and chemistry on our planet , and its puzzling properties are a challenge for science @xcite . yet water quantum behavior has received less attention than its classical thermodynamic properties , in spite of the modest cooling needed to evidence quantum effects in water . </S>",
    "<S> these have been recently suggested to determine the water density maximum @xcite and shown to influence the molecular geometry @xcite and in particular the oh bond - length . </S>",
    "<S> quantum effects have also been evidenced in the short time dynamics of protons along the oh bond in supercooled @xcite and confined water @xcite , by deep inelastic neutron scattering ( dins ) @xcite experiments and computer simulations @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we report dins measurements on bulk water in the stable phase around the density maximum and in the supercooled metastable regime , showing clear evidence for quantum effects on the momentum distribution @xmath0 and mean kinetic energy @xmath1 of water protons .    at present dins </S>",
    "<S> is the only technique which determines the momentum distribution and mean kinetic energy of a single particle in condensed matter . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on neutron scattering measurements at high energy ( 1 ev @xmath2 200 ev ) and momentum ( 120@xmath3 300@xmath4 ) transfers , thus probing both the short - time dynamics and local environment of the particle . </S>",
    "<S> the high energy and wave vector transfers achieved allow the scattering process to be described within the framework of the impulse approximations ( ia ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this assumes that neutron scattering is incoherent and occurring within time scales much shorter than the typical relaxation times of the collective excitations of the system . in these conditions </S>",
    "<S> the struck particle recoils freely from the collision , with inter - particle interaction in the final state being negligible ( i.e. the wave - function of the particle in its final state assumed to be a plane wave ) . in a molecular system , as for instance water , the contribution to the scattering cross section of protons can be easily distinguished from that of oxygens , due to the large mass difference . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering cross section is then expressed in terms of the single proton momentum distribution @xmath0 , whose variance is directely related to its mean kinetic energy @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> these quantities provide a richness of information about the potential surface that the proton experiences @xcite , including the effects of hydrogen bonding , thus complementing microscopic structural studies @xcite and allowing a direct comparison with quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> dins experiments have been carried out on the vesuvio spectrometer @xcite , at the isis spallation neutron source ( uk ) . </S>",
    "<S> the samples were contained in the same disk shaped aluminum can ( 5 cm diameter , 1 mm thickness ) with inner teflon coating used in previous work on supercooled water @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimental data have been recorded at 64 fixed - angle detectors in the standard resonance detector configuration @xcite employing the foil cycling technique @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> data have been corrected for multiple scattering , aluminium and oxygen signal , by using the same routines as in previous work @xcite . within the ia framework </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical structure factor , @xmath6 , is related to the @xmath0 through the relation :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the energy transfer , @xmath9 is the recoil energy of the struck atom of mass @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the vavevector transfer . </S>",
    "<S> the standard deviation of the @xmath0 function , @xmath12 , is related to @xmath5 , through the relation @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical structure factor is then expressed in terms of a neutron compton profile ( ncp ) @xcite : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the west scaling variable @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ncp lineshape is convolved with the instrumental resolution function , and represented as a series expansion in hermite polynomials :    @xmath16\\label{gr}\\;\\ ] ]    the coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath12 , appearing in the series expansion , have been determined by a least squares fitting procedure ( see caption of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) , and small corrections due to deviations from the ia were taken into account @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we did not attempt to correct for the so - called _ intensity deficit _ seen for hydrogen relative to heavier nuclei @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> altough the issue of the intensity deficit in dins experiment is still debated , it should be noted that in systems where the @xmath0 and the ncp are purely gaussian , such as zrh@xmath18 , no distortion of the measured ncp is indeed observed @xcite . finally the @xmath0 is expressed by the expansion @xcite    </S>",

    "<S> figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of proton s @xmath5 measured in both stable and metastable phases of bulk water in the temperature range from 300 k to 269 k , along with the semi - classical prediction , @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of @xmath21 in the stable water phase , shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 as a dotted line , has been derived in ref . , taking into account translational , rotational , and vibrational contributions , including the optical spectroscopic data available in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> while data for ice @xcite and water @xcite above 293 k , including supercritical states @xcite , are satisfactorily described by the semi - classical prediction , data around the temperature of maximum density and in the supercooled phase show an excess of proton mean kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> in particular @xmath1 shows two maxima : one at 277 k and the other in the supercooled phase in the range 269 k - 271 k , with an excess of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath21 of about 3 kj / mol ( 30 mev ) and 12 kj / mol ( 120 mev ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the peculiar temperature dependence of @xmath5 , suggests that two distinct mechanisms may be considered below and above the melting temperature . as a matter of fact </S>",
    "<S> the excess of @xmath5 in the stable water phase is moderate and its temperature dependence follows that of density @xcite , showing a maximum at the same temperature ( see insert in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a correlation between density and @xmath5 , as measured by dins , is not a novelty in principle , as it has already been observed in helium @xcite and explained in that case by using a harmonic model for the fluid . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless the peculiar density behavior of water and the temperature evolution of the h - bond network does not allow a similar model to work in this case . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest instead that the anomaly of @xmath5 vs @xmath22 above 273 k may be explained as a further evidence for water structural anomalies , which manifest through the existence of a maximum of density and transport properties in the stable water phase @xcite . within this hypothesis </S>",
    "<S> the maximum of @xmath5 at 277.15 k , shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , may be an indirect manifestation of the competition between zero point energy , @xmath23 , and thermal fluctuations , which has been proposed as the quantum origin of the density maximum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we notice however that quantum effects are not necessarily required to explain the existence of a maximum of density in water @xcite .    on the other side the huge increase of @xmath5 in the metastable states of water , already observed in a recent publication @xcite and confirmed by present new measurements at 272.15 and 272.95 k , </S>",
    "<S> seems to be directely related to the likely delocalization of protons along the h - bond . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows the radial momentum distribution , @xmath24 , at 277.15 and 271.15 k. this function at the lowest temperature shows a narrowing at low-@xmath25 and a shoulder at high-@xmath25 ( @xmath2617@xmath4 ) , compared to that measured at 277.15 k , compatible with the transition from a single to a double well potential . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a shoulder at high-@xmath25 in the radial momentum distribution has indeed been ascribed to coherent delocalization of protons over two sites of a double well potential @xcite felt by the proton along the h - bond direction between two water molecules . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> a statistical ensamble of water molecules in which protons are localized in the vicinity of the covalently bonded oxygens is predicted to show a single maximum of @xmath24 at @xmath27 6 @xmath4 , corresponding to the intramolecular o - h distance @xmath281  , as shown in fig . 2 and confirmed by quantum mechanical simulations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , the appearence of a shoulder at @xmath27 17 @xmath4 in the metastable supercooled phase indicates a delocalization of the proton over a distance @xmath29    from the equilibrium position . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that @xmath5 in the supercooled phase is comparable with the h - bond energy ( @xmath26 20 kj / mol ) and @xmath30 is ompatible with the width of the fluctuations of the h - bond length ( width of the first intermolecular peak of the oxygen - hydrogen radial distribution function ) and the oxygen - oxygen distance in supercooled water @xcite . based on this observation </S>",
    "<S> , we proposed @xcite the quantum excess of proton mean kinetic energy be correlated to the average distance between two first neighboring h - bonded oxygens in water . </S>",
    "<S> such assignement was corroborated by similar evidences in confined water @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further evidences for a correlation between proton delocalization and distance between its neighboring oxygens are given in ref . and , showing the changes of the potential landscape , energy barrier and wave - function of a proton as a function of this o - o distance .    </S>",
    "<S> the present results show a clear and unexpected anomalous temperature dependence of the proton mean kinetic energy . below 273 k , in the supercooled phase </S>",
    "<S> , this anomalous behavior is associated with a coherent delocalization of the proton between first neighbor oxygens . above 273 </S>",
    "<S> k the temperature dependence of the proton mean kinetic energy resembles that of water density .    </S>",
