    "the standard model predicts @xmath17  violation to occur in @xmath20 meson decays owing to a complex phase in the @xmath21 cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix@xcite .",
    "this phase is illustrated by plotting the unitarity condition @xmath22 as vectors in the complex plane : the phase results in a triangle of nonzero height .",
    "various measurements in the @xmath19 system are sensitive to the internal angles @xmath14 , @xmath16 , and @xmath1   ( also known as @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath3 , respectively ) ; these measurements allow us to determine the angles and check whether the triangle closes .",
    "non - closure would indicate physics beyond the standard model . here",
    "we present measurements of @xmath14  and @xmath16  obtained by measuring time - dependent @xmath17  asymmetries , and a measurement of @xmath1  obtained by measuring an asymmetry in the dalitz plot distribution of three - body decays .",

    "@xmath19 decays are identified using the `` beam - constrained '' mass @xmath28 and the energy difference @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the reconstructed @xmath19 momentum , @xmath31 is the reconstructed @xmath19 energy , and @xmath32 is the beam energy , all evaluated in the @xmath25 center - of - mass ( cm ) frame .",
    "a tagging algorithm@xcite is used to identify the flavor at production of the decaying  @xmath19 , i.e. , whether it is @xmath20 or  @xmath33 .",
    "this algorithm examines tracks not associated with the signal decay to identify the flavor of the non - signal  @xmath19 .",
    "the signal - side tracks are fit for a decay vertex , and the tag - side tracks are fit for a separate decay vertex ; the distance @xmath34 between vertices is to a very good approximation proportional to the time difference @xmath35 between the @xmath19 decays : @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the lorentz boost of the cm system .",
    "the dominant background is typically @xmath38 continuum events , where @xmath39 . in the cm frame",
    "such events tend to be jet - like , whereas @xmath40 events tend to be spherical .",
    "the sphericity of an event is usually quantified via fox - wolfram moments@xcite of the form @xmath41 , where @xmath42 runs over all tracks on the tagging side and @xmath43 runs over all tracks on either the tagging side or the signal side@xcite .",
    "the function @xmath44 is the @xmath45th legendre polynomial and @xmath46 is the angle between momenta @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the cm frame .",
    "these moments are combined into a fisher discriminant , and this is combined with the probability density function ( pdf ) for @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the polar angle in the cm frame between the @xmath19 direction and the @xmath51 axis ( nearly along the @xmath52 beam direction ) .",

    "the decay is dominated by a @xmath88 tree amplitude and a @xmath89 penguin amplitude .",
    "the latter can be divided into two pieces : a piece with @xmath90 and @xmath91 in the loop that has the same weak phase as the tree amplitude , and a piece with @xmath92 and @xmath91 in the loop that has a different weak phase but is suppressed by @xmath93 relative to the first piece . due to this suppression",

    "there are several decay modes that proceed exclusively via penguin amplitudes ( e.g. , @xmath103 proceeding via @xmath104 ) or else are dominated by penguin amplitudes ( e.g. , @xmath105 proceeding via @xmath106 ) but have the same weak phase as the @xmath88 tree amplitude .",
    "this is because the penguin loop factorizes into a @xmath107 loop with the same weak phase and a @xmath108 loop with a different weak phase ; the latter , however , is suppressed by @xmath93 relative to the former and plays a negligible role .",
    "we thus expect these decays to also have @xmath100 , @xmath109 .",
    "there are small mode - dependent corrections ( @xmath110 ) to this prediction due to final - state rescattering@xcite .",

    "the nonzero value for @xmath132 indicates direct @xmath17  violation ; the statistical significance ( including systematic uncertainty ) is  @xmath136 .",
    "these values also imply that the magnitude of the penguin amplitude relative to that of the tree amplitude ( @xmath137 ) is greater than 0.17 at 95.4%  cl , and that the strong phase difference ( @xmath138 ) lies in the range @xmath139 at 95.4%  cl .",
