    "a fundamental problem in knot theory is to classify knots and links by type , and several algebraic and geometric invariants have been developed with this goal in mind .",
    "recently swatee naik and ted stanford have shown an equivalence between s - equivalence of knots , a purely algebraic invariant , and the doubled - delta move on knot diagrams , a purely geometric relation .",
    "they prove that two knots are related by a sequence of doubled - delta moves if and only if the knots are s - equivalent @xcite .",
    "we prove that the analogous connection for links between s - equivalence and the doubled - delta move , posed as a question by stavros garoufalidis , is false .",
    "we define a new invariant of ordered links called _ strong s - equivalence _ that is in many ways better suited for links than the classical definition of s - equivalence .  with this new definition , we are able to prove a theorem analogous to naik and stanford s result for links .",
    "our main theorem also ties these results to the emerging subject of clasper surgery , which has strong connections to the field of quantum topology ,  an area of study that encompasses the jones polynomials , vassiliev invariants , and the kontsevitch integral .",
    "consider two oriented , ordered @xmath2-component links @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the following four statements are equivalent :    \\i .",
    "@xmath5 can be obtained from @xmath3 through a sequence of doubled - delta moves .",
    "\\ii . @xmath6 and @xmath4 are related by a sequence of @xmath7-clasper surgeries , where each leaf of each clasper has total linking number zero with the link .",
    "\\iii . @xmath3 and @xmath4 are strongly s - equivalent .",
    "\\iv . for some choice of seifert surfaces @xmath8 and @xmath9 and bases of @xmath10 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 have identical ordered seifert matrices .    throughout the paper , a _ _",
    "link _ _ @xmath0 with @xmath2-components is a subset of @xmath11 , or of @xmath12 , that consists of @xmath2 disjoint , piecewise linear , simple closed curves ( a link with one component is a _ knot _ ) .  unless otherwise noted , all links will be oriented and ordered .",
    "seifert surfaces for links will be required to be connected , and @xmath13 will denote the minimal genus among possible seifert surfaces .",
    "before defining the doubled - delta move , we look first at the simpler ( single ) delta move .",
    "the _ delta move _ shown in figure [ fig delta ]  is a particular move on knot or link diagrams .  given a link containing the tangle in figure [ fig delta]a ,",
    "replace the tangle with that of figure [ fig delta]b in such a way that respects the free ends .",
    "it is clear that the delta move preserves the pairwise linking numbers of the components , since for each pair of strands , the move changes neither the crossing nor the orientation .",
    "though less obvious , the converse is also true , as proved by murakami and nakanishi in @xcite :  two links have the same sets of pairwise linking numbers if and only if they are equivalent under delta moves .",
    "since a knot is a one - component link , it follows that any two knots are equivalent under delta moves",
    ".      the _ doubled - delta move _  is _ _",
    "_ _ similar to the single delta move , with each of the three strands being replaced by a pair of oppositely oriented strands .",
    "the link components that comprise the six affected strands are irrelevant .",
    "the doubled - delta move is more restrictive than the ( single ) delta move , but it still preserves the pairwise linking numbers .          the delta move and doubled - delta move partition knots and links into equivalence classes .",
    "two links are said to be in the same class if they are related by a sequence of such moves .",
    "however , unlike many of the basic moves that change a knot or link diagram , the delta and doubled - delta move are closely related to other operations used by topologists in a variety of contexts .  in figure [ fig delta = borr ] , we see that the effect of the delta move is the same as adding inborromean rings .",
    "another name for the operation depicted in the figure is borromean ( or borromeo ) surgery .",
    "we will see in section [ section clasper ] how borromean surgery relates to claspers , and thus to grope cobordisms , finite - type invariants , and other ideas of low - dimensional topology .",
    "under what conditions are two links related by a sequence of doubled - delta moves ?  this question is interesting to many topologists in the context of clasper surgery , a special case of which is borromean surgery .",
    "claspers were first defined by k. habiro @xcite , where they arose in the context of finite - type invariants .",
    "habiro demonstrated how the theory of claspers provides an alternative calculus under which one can study finite - type invariants of knots and 3-manifolds .",
    "claspers also were implicit in the work of goussarov @xcite@xcite .  today",
    ", they are studied across various fields of low - dimensional topology .",
    "in addition to applications of finite - type invariants , p.  teichner and j. conant examine claspers relationships to grope cobordisms @xcite ,  and s. garoufalidis uses clasper surgery @xcite to better understand the kontsevich integral and concordance classes of knots .",
    "a _ clasper _ is a compact surface constructed from the following three types of pieces :    * _ edges _ , or bands that connect the other two types of pieces * _ nodes _ , or disks with three incident edges * _ leaves _ , or annuli with one incident edge",
    ".    the annuli that comprise the leaves may be twisted with any number of full twists .",
    "we call this number the _ framing _ of the leaf .",
    "figure fig clasperlinka shows a clasper with zero - framed leaves .",
    "-clasper , with its associated link . ]",
    "assume that a clasper @xmath14 is embedded in a 3-manifold @xmath15 .  to do surgery on the clasper means to remove a handlebody neighborhood of the clasper from a @xmath16-manifold @xmath17 , and glue it back in a prescribed way according to the clasper and its framing .",
    "in particular , we associate a link @xmath18 to the clasper @xmath14 as in figure [ fig clasperlink]b using the following substitutions :  each node of the clasper is replaced by a copy of the positive , zero - framed borromean rings , and each edge is replaced by a positive hopf link .  leaves of the clasper do not contribute additional link components , but the framing of a leaf does determine the framing of the hopf link component corresponding to that leaf s adjacent edge .",
    "clasper surgery , then , is really integer surgery on the associated framed link .",
    "an important property of clasper surgery is that it preserves the homology of the affected manifold .",
    "when each leaf of the clasper clasps  a knot or link and at least one leaf bounds a disk in @xmath19 , the result of the surgery is a new knot or link in the same @xmath16-manifold .",
    "surgery on the simplest clasper  the strut , with a single edge and two leaves  can accomplish a single crossing change in the original knot .",
    "since the crossing change is an unknotting relation , all knots are related by strut - clasper surgery .",
    "the simplest interesting clasper , then , is the @xmath20-clasper .",
    "one may also argue that the @xmath7-clasper is the most interesting clasper , since any larger clasper may be realized as several @xmath7-claspers by expanding edges of the larger clasper into hopf - linked pairs of leaves @xcite .      in @xcite ,",
    "s. garoufalidis and l. rozansky discuss _ null claspers , _ those whose leaves are null - homologous links in @xmath21 for a 3-manifold @xmath15 and knot @xmath22 .",
    "such leaves are sent to zero under the map @xmath23 ;  in other words , each leaf has algebraic linking number zero with the knot .",
    "garoufalidis and rozansky explain that null claspers have been used to demonstrate a rational version of the kontsevich integral and can be used to define a notion of finite - type invariants .  in lemma 1.3 of @xcite , they show that surgery on null claspers preserves not only the homology of a knot complement , but also the alexander module and blanchfield linking form .",
    "furthermore , null clasper surgery describes a move on the set of knots in integral homology spheres that directly corresponds to the doubled - delta move .",
    "extending garoufalidis s and rozansky s definition to links , for the pair @xmath24 , where @xmath15 is a 3-manifold and @xmath0 is a link , a null clasper would be one whose leaves have linking number zero with each component .",
    "unfortunately , the doubled - delta move acts on the strands of a link independently of the link components .",
    "therefore , in considering the relationship between claspers and the doubled - delta move , our interest is with a slightly larger class of claspers : @xmath25those in which each leaf clasps several strands of the link in such a way that the _ total _ linking number with all link components is zero .",
    "we claim that when the leaves of a zero - framed @xmath7-clasper each have _ total _ linking number zero with the link , the @xmath7-clasper surgery has the same effect on the link as a finite sequence of doubled - delta moves , as well as that of borromean surgery .",
    "this is one of the implications of our main theorem , and is illustrated in figure [ fig ddelta = clasper ] .",
    "many of the basic algebraic invariants of knot theory , including  the alexander module , the conway polynomial , and the signature , depend only on the seifert matrix of a knot or link , which is readily computable but not uniquely defined . for every @xmath2-component link @xmath0 in @xmath26 , there is a seifert surface @xmath27 associated to the link , where @xmath28 is a connected , oriented , embedded surface with the components of @xmath0 as its boundary .  given a basis @xmath29 of @xmath30",
    ", we can associate a _",
    "seifert matrix _",
    "@xmath15 to the link @xmath0 , where the entries of @xmath15 are defined from the linking number of two basis elements .",
    "in particular , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a pushoff of @xmath33 in the positive normal direction .",
    "s - equivalence is a notion that has been widely considered for both knots and links @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "two square integral matrices @xmath15 and @xmath34 are said to be _ s - equivalent _ if @xmath15 can be transformed into @xmath34 by a finite sequence of integral congruences ( that is , @xmath35 for some integral matrix @xmath36 with @xmath37 ) and row or column enlargements / reductions of the form    @xmath38    a more precise statement of these definitions is given in section [ section sseq ] . up to s - equivalence ,",
    "seifert matrices are well - defined for knots and links .      despite being a purely algebraic relation ,",
    "s - equivalence has geometric implications for knots .  in particular ,",
    "s. naik and t. stanford prove that two knots are s - equivalent if and only if they are equivalent by a sequence of doubled - delta moves @xcite .",
    "one might assume that a similar statement should be true of links .",
    "is the s - equivalence of two links enough to guarantee that they are equivalent under a sequence of doubled - delta moves ?",
    "this question was posed by stavros garoufalidis in the context of clasper surgery , and given that all the definitions leading up to s - equivalence are the same for links as they are for knots , it seems that the analogous proof for links should follow in a straightforward fashion from the proof of naik - stanford .",
    "the question seems plausible , but in fact it is false .",
    "we prove by counterexample in proposition [ prop ssnecessary ] that two s - equivalent links are not necessarily related by a sequence of doubled - delta moves .",
    "[ prop ssnecessary]s - equivalence is not a sufficient condition for two links to be related by a sequence of doubled - delta moves .",
    "the two links @xmath3 and @xmath4 depicted in figure [ fig snotsslinkex ] are s - equivalent but not related by a sequence of doubled delta moves .",
    "note that the pairwise linking numbers of the first link are @xmath39 while for the second link they are @xmath40 .",
    "since the doubled - delta move preserves pairwise linking numbers , these two links can not be related by doubled - delta moves .",
    "the fact that the two links are s - equivalent can be seen by choosing seifert surfaces as in figure [ fig surface1ab ] ,        with bases @xmath41 and @xmath42 .  each of the surfaces can be viewed as a punctured 2-sphere with a y - shaped band glued along the boundary , where each of the three strips of the y is twisted according to the desired linking numbers .",
    "the seifert matrices are then @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the matrix @xmath45 satisfies the condition @xmath46 , demonstrating that the two links are in fact s - equivalent .    finding the sufficient conditions to extend the naik - stanford theorem",
    "will require some new definitions , treated in section [ section sseq ] .",
    "as shown in proposition [ prop ssnecessary ] , the classical definition of s - equivalence is inadequate for the proof of our main theorem , and actually it seems inappropriate for links in many contexts .  treating a link as a disjoint knot",
    ", s - equivalence regards the entire link as a whole , without reference to the individual components .",
    "strong s - equivalence , defined below , better respects the boundary components of a seifert surface , and hence the components of the link .",
