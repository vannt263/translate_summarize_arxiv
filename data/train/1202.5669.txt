    "cyclic universe has always been a burning topic in the field of theoretical cosmology , since it is expected to avoid the initial singularity by providing an infinitely oscillating universe .",
    "however cyclic universe confront a serious problem of black holes(bhs ) .",
    "if the bhs formed during the expanding phase survives into the next cycle they will grow even larger from one cycle to the next and act as a serious defect in an otherwise nearly uniform universe . with the passage of time the bhs will occupy the entire horizon and then the cyclic models will break away . in this paper",
    "we investigate the possibility of an oscillating universe in two of the well known models of brane - world gravity , namely , rsii brane and dgp brane models .",
    "randall and sundrum @xcite proposed a bulk - brane model to explain the higher dimensional theory , popularly known as rs ii brane model . according to this model we live in a four dimensional world ( called 3-brane , a domain wall ) which is embedded in a 5d space time ( bulk ) .",
    "all matter fields are confined in the brane whereas gravity can only propagate in the bulk .",
    "the consistency of this brane model with the expanding universe has given popularity to this model of late in the field of cosmology .",
    "a simple and effective model of brane - gravity is the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) braneworld model @xcite which models our 4-dimensional world as a frw brane embedded in a 5-dimensional minkowski bulk .",
    "it explains the origin of dark energy(de ) as the gravity on the brane leaking to the bulk at large scale . on the 4-dimensional brane",
    "the action of gravity is proportional to @xmath2 whereas in the bulk it is proportional to the corresponding quantity in 5-dimensions .",
    "the model is then characterized by a cross over length scale @xmath3 such that gravity is 4-dimensional theory at scales @xmath4 where matter behaves as pressureless dust , but gravity leaks out into the bulk at scales @xmath5 and matter approaches the behaviour of a cosmological constant .",
    "moreover it has been shown that the standard friedmann cosmology can be firmly embedded in dgp brane .    to explain the latest cosmic acceleration one usually assumes the existence of dark energy ( de ) with a negative pressure .",
    "in general one can assume a perfect fluid with state equation @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , in order to realize the cosmic acceleration .",
    "most models of de in the present universe predict that its effective equation of state satisfies the null energy condition ( nec ) , i.e. , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the effective de density and pressure , respectively .",
    "however , the observations do not rule out that de is phantom , i.e. , it violates nec .",
    "observations from wmap indicates the value @xmath11 @xcite , which means that our universe would be dominated by phantom energy ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that phantom dark energy can be successfully accomodated within framework of general relativity ( gr ) .    in the context of bhs and phantom energy accretion on bh",
    ", it should be mentioned that babichev et al @xcite has shown that bh mass decrease with phantom energy accretion on it .",
    "jamil et al @xcite studied charged bhs in phantom cosmology .",
    "jamil in @xcite has shown the evolution of a schwarzschild black hole in phantom - like chaplygin gas cosmologies .",
    "primordial bhs in phantom cosmology and accretion of phantom de on btz bhs were also studied by jamil et al in @xcite .",
    "nayak in @xcite investigated the effect of vacuum energy on the evolution of primordial bhs in einstein gravity .",
    "paolis in @xcite studied bhs in bulk viscous cosmology . in the context of cyclic cosmology",
    ", it should be mentioned that saridakis in @xcite studied cyclic universes from general collisionless braneworld models .",
    "cai et al in @xcite investigated cyclic extension of the non - singular cosmology in a model of non - relativistic gravity .",
    "cai et al in @xcite investigated cyclic and singularity - free evolutions in a universe governed by lagrange - multiplier modified gravity .",
    "moreover cai et al in @xcite showed that gravity described by an arbitrary function of the torsion scalar , can provide a mechanism for realizing bouncing cosmologies , thereby avoiding the big bang singularity .",
    "non - singular cyclic cosmology without phantom menace was also studied by cai et al in @xcite .",
    "we intend to study the effects and consequences of phantom energy accretion onto bhs in a cyclic scenario of the universe described by dgp and rsii branes .",
    "our motivation is to find out if there is any remanent mass of bh when it undergoes a turnaround in a cyclic scenario .",
    "as mentioned earlier babichev et al @xcite has shown that bh mass decrease with phantom energy accretion on it .",
    "hence the bh will disappear before the turnaround in an oscillating universe .",
    "but sun @xcite provided a mechanism which showed that in an universe described by modified friedmann cosmology the destruction of bhs is totally out of question , as there is always a remanent mass of a bh facing a turnaround . in this paper",
    "our motivation is to testify the above fact for brane - world cosmology and find out the fate of a bh undergoing phantom energy accretion in an oscillating universe .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we discuss the mechanism of cyclic universe in rsii brane model .",
    "section 3 deals with an identical mechanism for dgp brane model . in section 4 , we present an argument regarding hawking evaporation of remanent bhs .",
    "finally the paper ends with some concluding remarks in section 5 .",
    "the novel feature of the rs models compared to previous higher - dimensional models is that the observable 3 dimensions are protected from the large extra dimension ( at low energies ) by curvature rather than straightforward compactification . in rs",
    "ii model the effective equations of motion on the 3-brane embedded in 5d bulk having @xmath13-symmetry are given by @xcite @xmath14 where    @xmath15    @xmath16    and @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the electric part of the 5d weyl tensor . here",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath1 are respectively the 5d gravitational coupling constant , 5d cosmological constant , the brane tension ( vacuum energy ) , brane energy - momentum tensor and effective 4d cosmological constant .",
    "the explicit form of the above modified einstein equations in flat universe for rsii brane are    @xmath20    and @xmath21 the dark radiation @xmath22 obeys    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the total energy density and pressure respectively .",
    "we consider an homogeneous and isotropic universe filled with de fluid , with de density @xmath24 and pressure @xmath25 . for an asymptotic observer the black hole mass ,",
    "@xmath26 changes at the rate of @xcite @xmath27 here the overdot denotes the derivative with respect to cosmic time .",
    "moreover it has been considered that @xmath28 .",
    "we consider an universe dominated by de .",
    "the friedmann equation for the expanding universe is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the conservation equation for de is given by @xmath31 phantom de has the equation of state  @xmath32 .",
    "we get that @xmath33 , which shows that @xmath24 increases with the expansion of the universe .    in this section",
    "we will investigate the dynamics of cyclic universe in rsii brane model .",
    "the modified friedmann equation for rsii brane model is given by equation ( [ cyclic5.5 ] ) .",
    "putting @xmath34 , the equation becomes , @xmath35 in the expanding phase of the universe , the phantom energy density , @xmath24 increases . from the above equation",
    "we see that at the turnaround the phantom energy density is given by , @xmath36 where @xmath37 .    from the above value we see that when @xmath38 , then @xmath39 , and when @xmath40 , then @xmath41 .",
    "this shows that either the brane tension or the bulk cosmological constant has to be negative , so that the universe undergoes a bounce , and a possibility for the cyclic scenario is evident .",
    "here @xmath43 stands for critical density . after",
    "the turnaround the universe begins to contract .",
    "the reason behind this being , that in the contracting phase the non - phantom components of the universe increase and begins to dominate the evolution . in this phase , again when the dominant energy density reaches the critical value given by equation ( [ cyclic5.12 ] ) , a bounce occurs .",
    "thus we get an oscillating scenario .",
    "we intend to study the variation of bh mass with phantom energy accretion around it , in this oscillating cosmological model .      using equations ( [ cyclic5.8 ] ) and ( [ cyclic5.10 ] )",
    "we get @xmath44 before turnaround , we have @xmath45 now substituting the above value of @xmath46 in equation ( [ cyclic5.13 ] ) we get , @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath43 is given by equation ( [ cyclic5.12 ] ) . now integrating equation ( [ cyclic5.15 ] ) we get , @xmath49 here @xmath50 and @xmath51 denotes respectively the phantom energy density and the black hole mass at the moment when the phantom energy density just begins to dominate the evolution of the universe . in general , @xmath52 and @xmath53 . so using equation ( [ cyclic5.12 ] ) we obtain @xmath54 .",
    "hence from equation ( [ cyclic5.16 ] ) , we obtain @xmath55 at the turnaround , @xmath56 and hence the black hole mass at the turnaround becomes , @xmath57 this shows that there is a remnant mass of the bh when the turnaround occurs .",
    "hence this result is different from the result obtained by zhang @xcite .",
    "it is quite clear from the above equations that initially , through phantom energy accretion , the bh mass decreases , until it reaches the minimum value @xmath58 at the turnaround in the expanding phase . for @xmath59 ,",
    "@xmath58 becomes independent of @xmath51 @xmath60      after the turnaround as expected the the universe will contract and consequently the phantom energy density @xmath24 starts decreasing . during the contraction it is obvious that the time derivative of the scale factor will become negative , and as a result @xmath46 becomes negative",
    "so , here we take the value of @xmath46 as , @xmath61 substituting the above value of @xmath46 in equation ( [ cyclic5.13 ] ) we get , @xmath62 now integrating the above equation we get , @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "the above equation shows that as the universe contracts , the bh mass continue to decrease .",
    "when @xmath65 , then the bh mass is , @xmath66 for @xmath67 , using equation ( [ cyclic5.19 ] ) we find that the final mass of bhs is @xmath68 hence @xmath69 is independent of @xmath51 .",

    "other parameters are fixed at @xmath72 +    in figure 1 , plot is generated for the mass of the bh against the density of phantom de , in the expanding cycle before the turnaround .",
    "we know that in the expanding phase , the phantom energy components dominates over the non - phantom counterparts . as a result",
    ", phantom energy begins accreting on the bhs in this cycle . from the figure , it is seen that with the increase in the phantom energy density before turnaround , the bh mass gradually decreases , due to more and more accreting phenomenon going on the bh .",
    "this result is in complete accordance with babichev et al @xcite .    in figure 2 ,",
    "the bh mass is plotted against the phantom energy density , in the contracting cycle after the turnaround .",
    "it is clearly evident from the figure that as the non - phantom components begin to dominate in the contracting phase , the bh mass cease to diminish .",
    "this is quite an expected result .",
    "while flat , homogeneous and isotropic brane is being considered , the friedmann equation in dgp brane model is modified to the equation @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the hubble parameter , @xmath24 is the total cosmic fluid energy density and @xmath75 is the cross - over scale which determines the transition from 4d to 5d behaviour and @xmath76 ( choosing @xmath77 ) . for @xmath78",
    ", we have standard dgp@xmath79 model which is self accelerating model without any form of de , and effective @xmath80 is always non - phantom .",
    "however for @xmath81 , we have dgp@xmath82 model which does not self accelerate but requires de on the brane .",
    "it experiences 5d gravitational modifications to its dynamics which effectively screen de .    like the original friedmann equation , and contrary to rsii brane equation ,",
    "the dgp brane equation does not readily support an oscillating universe undergoing turnarounds .",
    "this fact is quite obvious from the equation ( [ cyclic5.25 ] ) .",
    "we can see that there is no possibility of turnaround .",
    "therefore we will propose a modified dgp brane equation , that can support a cyclic universe .",
    "sun et al in @xcite proposed a method , by which they were able to modify the friedmann equation into a form that avoids the big rip singularity and gives a bouncing cosmological model .",
    "their investigations led to the fact that the character of physics changes remarkably near the planck scale .",
    "we know that a de sitter universe with a cosmological constant , @xmath83 is similar to a bh .",
    "also it has a temperature , @xmath84 .",
    "hence by conjecturing physics at the planck scale , they actually modified the definition of hawking temperature , and subsequently obtained the modified friedmann equation .",
    "sun in @xcite used this modified equation successfully to study the phantom energy accretion on bhs . hence , taking a leaf out of their book , we proceed to modify the dgp brane equation as follows : the proposed modified dgp brane equation is @xmath85 from the above equation , we see that the turnaround occurs for @xmath86 .",

    "hence we see that the mass of bh gradually decrease during the expanding phase of cyclic universe , due to phantom energy accretion and finally becomes minimum at the turnaround , when it is called the critical mass , given by equation([cyclic5.30 ] ) . for @xmath67",

    "from the above evaluation it is clear that there is always a remanent mass of the bhs at the turnaround in an oscillating universe .",
    "so contrary to existing literature we conclude that there is no possibility of destruction of bh .",
    "the bhs formed during the expanding cycle of the cyclic universe survive into the next cycle and eventually grow in size .",
    "therefore they create undesired non - uniformity in a nearly uniform universe .",
    "eventually the bhs will occupy the entire volume of the horizon and will be responsible for the destruction of the cyclic models .",
    "this is a serious defect indeed !",
    "hence the problem posed by the bhs in a cyclic universe still stands un - eliminated .",
    "but in @xcite it has been argued that for a bh with mass @xmath117 , hawking evaporation takes place in time @xmath118 sec and ultimately the bh becomes non - existent , thus causing no problems . here",
    "@xmath119 represents planck mass . in our above calculations",
    "we have considered @xmath120 . rewriting equation ( [ cyclic5.18 ] ) , for rsii brane we get , @xmath121 @xmath122 is taken as a constant of the order unity and @xmath123 .",
    "then we have @xmath124 . for a bh with @xmath67 , @xmath125 ,",
    "i.e. , the remanent mass of the bh is of the order of planck mass .",
    "hence the remanent bh undergoes hawking evaporation in time @xmath126 sec at the order of planck time .",
    "a similar evaluation is possible for dgp brane model as well .",
    "so fortunately , the remanent bhs do not cause any problems .",
    "this gives a possible solution of the bh problem in cyclic universe described by brane - world scenario .",
    "a serious problem is posed by the existence of black holes in an oscillating universe . in @xcite",
    "brown et al suggested that in an oscillating cosmology the black holes keep losing mass due to phantom energy accretion before totally disappearing before the turnaround .",
    "babichev et al in @xcite devised a successful mechanism which was in accordance with the result given by brown et al . in this paper",
    "we have investigated the outcome of phantom energy accretion on black holes in a cyclic universe described by brane - worlds .",
    "it is seen that rsii brane model readily incorporates the oscillating nature in its framework .",
    "the only condition being the negativity of the brane tension , @xmath0 or the bulk cosmological constant , @xmath1 .",
    "but unlike rsii brane model , dgp brane does not readily support the cyclic nature of the universe .",
    "so a modified dgp brane equation , that supports cyclic turnarounds has been proposed for our evaluation .",
    "it is found that for rsii brane model , during the expanding phase the black hole mass gradually decrease with the increase of phantom energy density and finally reaches a critical value at which the turnaround occurs .",
    "this result is absolutely consistent with the known results in literature . in the contracting phase the black hole mass again decreases with the increase in the non - phantom components of the universe",
    "this is however contrary to our expectations .",
    "so it is understood that our evaluations after the turnaround are not really rigid .",
    "we see that the black holes in a cyclic universe reaches a remanent mass , @xmath58 before turnaround .",
    "so , the remanent mass implies that the destruction of black holes is not a real possibility in the cyclic cosmology , with phantom energy turnarounds , for a universe characterized by brane gravity .",
    "however fortunately we find that the remanent masses of black holes at turnaround do not cause problems .",
    "the reason being that these remanent black holes hawking evaporate in a time @xmath126 .",
