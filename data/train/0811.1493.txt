    "at present a scalar field @xmath4 plays a very important role in cosmological investigations .",
    "the discovery of cosmic acceleration @xcite is a motivation to study dynamical models of dark energy which can be treated as some alternatives to the cosmological constant ( see @xcite for review ) . in this context the simplest dynamical models involving the scalar field @xmath4 ( the quintessence idea @xcite ) minimally coupled to gravity with the potential @xmath5 are considered to model a time dependent equation of the state parameter @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and dot denotes differentiation with respect to the cosmic time @xmath9 .    on the other hand the unknown nature of dark energy expressed in terms of @xmath10",
    "can be constrained by a variety of astronomical observations .",
    "recently the wmap experiment has published its five - year data and polarization power spectra @xcite and new supernovae datasets of union compilation has also been published @xcite . it is interesting that some inflationary scenarios , i.e. forms of potential function of the scalar field can be rejected @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the single slow - rolling scalar field with potential @xmath11 is well within a @xmath12 confidence level region , whereas another scalar field potential @xmath13 has been excluded on more than a @xmath12 confidence level @xcite .",
    "while the simplest candidate for dark energy seems to be a positive cosmological constant , i.e. the lambdacdm model is favored by a bayesian model selection method @xcite , such an explanation of the accelerated expansion of the universe as associated with the vacuum energy meets the so - called fine tuning problem @xcite and it also suffers from the coincidence problem @xcite . therefore various alternative routes have been proposed like phantom @xcite or extended quintessence @xcite . while the minimally coupled scalar field endowed with a quadratic potential function",
    "has a strong motivation in inflationary models its generalizations with a simple non - minimal coupling term @xmath14 have been studied @xcite in the context of the origin of the canonical inflaton field itself .",
    "the physical motivation to study of non - minimally coupled scalar field could be possible application of this models to inflationary cosmology or to the present dark energy and has a long history ( see for example @xcite ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "our aim is to perform a complete study of the global dynamics , attractor properties and stability of trajectories of both canonical and phantom scalar fields in the framework of dynamical systems methods .",
    "recently the dynamical system methods was used to find attractor properties of phantom scalar field @xcite .",
    "such an analysis was restricted to the case of the simplest exponential or quadratic potential functions and minimally coupled scalar field ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "our study will include a non - minimal coupling of the scalar field to the gravity in the form of the term @xmath14 and we will not consider any a priori form of the potential of the scalar field .",
    "we take as phase variables the same variables used in @xcite in the context of minimally coupled canonical scalar field . the first attempt to study the minimally coupled scalar field with a quadratic potential cosmology in these variables",
    "was made by belinsky _",
    "_ @xcite . in this parameterization of the phase space the normalized variables of the scalar field and its first cosmic time derivative are used .",
    "the third new variable is related to the hubble function and the resulting system is a @xmath15dimensional autonomous one .",
    "earlier , a minimally coupled massive scalar field in the closed frw model was studied by starobinsky @xcite where analytical expression for the matter dominated and quasi - desitter stages was derived .    in our approach",
    "extended to the case of a non - minimally coupled scalar field we parameterize the phase space using the energy variables determined by the friedmann energy equation .",
    "the choice of two variables is the same like in the belinsky approach , but we complete the set of variables by a normalized variable related to the so - called roll parameter @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "therefore our dynamical analysis is the generalization of the studies @xcite to the case of non - vanishing coupling constant @xmath18 .",
    "in this section the dynamical system methods are used to study the dynamics of the scalar field non - minimally coupled to gravity in the robertson - walker geometry . to make the discussion less complex",
    ", we ignore any coupling of the scalar field to matter and assume that the universe is spatially flat .",
    "we choose as phase space variables the so - called `` energy variables '' introduced in @xcite which in the case of the minimal coupling @xmath19 assume the form @xmath20 where @xmath5 is a potential function of the scalar field @xmath4 , @xmath21 is the hubble parameter and @xmath22 is the scale factor .",
    "these variables determine the ratio of kinetic and potential energy of the scalar field to the total energy @xmath23 where @xmath24 for the flat model filled with the scalar field only .",
    "if we additionally postulate the presence of matter which satisfies the barotropic equation of state , then @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is constant and energy conservation requires @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the matter density parameter . because of ( [ eq:3 ] ) the trajectories in the phase space will always be located within the unit circle in the phase space .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to positive and monotonically decreasing potential functions @xmath5 we can consider only the trajectories located in one quadrant of the energy phase space .    above considerations",
    "can be simply generalized to the case of the non - minimal coupling of the scalar field ( both canonical and phantom ) to the curvature . in this case",
    "the action for the scalar field and gravity assumes the following form @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 corresponds to canonical and phantom scalar fields respectively , the metric signature is @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the ricci scalar , @xmath22 is the scale factor and a dot denotes differentiation with respect to the cosmological time .    after dropping the full derivatives with respect to time we obtain the dynamical equation for scalar field from variation @xmath35 @xmath36 as well as the energy conservation condition from variation @xmath37 @xmath38",
    "if we postulate the existence of a barotropic fluid in the universe the conservation condition reads @xmath39 @xmath40 from which we can simply receive the energy density and the pressure of the scalar field , namely    @xmath41    and in the flat frw model the equation of state ( eos ) for the scalar field is given by @xmath42    in the case of non - minimal coupling @xmath43 the additional variable @xmath44 should be chosen in the parameterization of dynamics @xmath45 the choice of phase variables is suggested as in the case of minimal coupling by the energy conservation condition written as @xmath46 or in terms of dynamical variables @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath44 @xmath49 where the sense of variables @xmath47 and @xmath48 is preserved like in @xmath50 case .",
    "this condition defines in the phase space a domain @xmath51 admissible for motion . if @xmath52 then condition ( [ eq:11 ] ) define a @xmath53-dimensional surface in the space @xmath54 .",
    "similarly the acceleration equation can be rewritten to the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 and after the substitution of ( [ eq:12 ] ) to ( [ eq:6b ] ) expressed in terms of variables @xmath54 we obtain @xmath57 where @xmath58 . finally after substitution of above formula into ( [ eq:13 ] )",
    "we can explicitly calculate @xmath59 , namely @xmath60 where @xmath29 is given by equation ( [ eq:11 ] ) .",
    "let us start to find the dynamical system describing the evolution of our model  the non - minimally coupled scalar field in the robertson - walker background .",
    "for derivation of basic equations we take @xmath61 ( or @xmath62 ) and then differentiate with respect to the cosmic time variable both sides of the expression",
    ". then we obtain @xmath63 where we have used the dynamical equation for the motion of the scalar field @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the ricci scalar .",
    "the above equation reduces to @xmath66 after the reparameterization @xmath67 we obtain @xmath68 finally , we obtain @xmath69 where @xmath29 is determined from the constraint condition ( [ eq:11 ] ) .",
    "the same method can be adopted to the variable @xmath70 , namely @xmath71 and @xmath72    and after the elimination of @xmath29 equations ( [ sys1 ] ) and ( [ sys2 ] ) can be presented in the form @xmath73",
    "@xmath74    where @xmath75 , @xmath76 for dust matter and radiation respectively .",
    "the dynamical equations ( [ sys1a ] ) and ( [ sys2a ] ) should be completed by two additional equations to make the dynamical system closed , namely @xmath77 and the last equation can be established from the definition of @xmath2 variable @xmath78 where @xmath79 .    making following time reparameterization @xmath80",
    "we can write complete dynamical system in the form    @xmath81    it is also another way to eliminate one of the variables , namely @xmath44 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath82 then the variable @xmath44 can be expressed by @xmath2 according to the formula @xmath83 if we assume that @xmath84 for an arbitrary constant @xmath85 , then @xmath86 can be integrated in the exact form @xmath87    let us now make some important remarks about the general properties of the system describing the evolution of the non - minimally coupled scalar field on the background of the robertson - walker symmetry :    * in the general case of non - vanishing barotropic matter the system is reduced to the form of a @xmath88-dimensional autonomous dynamical system which can be studied by the dynamical systems methods .",
    "the motion of the system is restricted to the domain @xmath89 * if effects of the barotropic matter are not considered then motion of the system in the phase space is restricted to the @xmath53-dimensional surface @xmath90 * if the form of the potential function is assumed at the very beginning then the scalar field cosmological model is represented by a @xmath53-dimensional dynamical system .",
    "let us consider the model without matter .",
    "the motion of the system takes place on the surface determined by equation ( 11 ) . putting @xmath52 this surface",
    "is given by @xmath91 by using this equation we can eliminate the variable @xmath48 from equation ( [ weff ] ) and now the effective equation of state coefficient assumes the following form @xmath92 if we assume that @xmath82 then from equation ( 27 ) we can eliminate the variable @xmath2 and reduce the dynamical system to the two - dimensional one    @xmath93    dynamics of this system for a quadratic potential function @xmath94 and the phantom scalar field @xmath95 have been studied in our previous work @xcite .    another possibility is the elimination of the variable @xmath44 and then the dynamical system is in the form    @xmath96     in the finite domain for model without the matter @xmath52 and @xmath97 as an example . the critical point in the origin @xmath98 is of a stable focus type ( see table [ tab:1 ] ) . ]    for the model with @xmath52 and arbitrary coupling constant we have following critical points at finite domain of the phase space    * ( @xmath99 , @xmath100 ) + the effective equation of state parameter calculated at this point is @xmath101 + the eigenvalues of the linearization matrix are @xmath102 where @xmath103 * ( @xmath99 , @xmath104 ) + the effective equation of state parameter is @xmath105 + the eigenvalues of the linearization matrix are @xmath106    the stability of the critical points depends on the sign of the real part of the eigenvalues .",
    "the first critical point will be always stable if only @xmath107 .",
    "for the second critical point which represents the radiation dominated universe we obtain a saddle critical point .",
    ".the simplest finite critical points for model with no matter content @xmath52 and arbitrary coupling constant @xmath18 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper we extended the analysis of the dynamics of the frw model with a minimal coupling to gravity scalar field ( both canonical and phantom ) to the case of a non - minimal coupling .",
    "we showed that in the general case the dynamics can be represented by a four - dimensional dynamical system .",
    "however , with the assumption that the form of the potential parameter is @xmath108 , the corresponding system can be reduced to the form of a 3-dimensional dynamical system . using the dynamical system methods we analyzed critical points appearing at a finite domain of the phase space and trajectories in their neighborhood .",
    "these trajectories can be obtained from the linearization of the system around a critical point of the type being determined by eigenvalues of the linearization matrix .",
    "we found some additional points in comparison to the case of the minimal coupling .",
    "there are in principle at most four families of critical points which character ( stability ) depend on the value of the non - minimal coupling constant . in the special case of @xmath50",
    "this system was investigated by zhou @xcite but we found that the critical points which were established by them lie rather at infinity ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "these critical points are out of interest because @xmath109 may lead to singularities",
    ". however , we use the same methodology as zhou and instead of postulating quintessence potential directly the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 is proposed .    for our dynamical analysis it would be useful to distinguish two cases : with matter @xmath110 and without matter @xmath52 .",
    "the former is corresponding to a 3-dimensional dynamical system ; in the latter one variable is eliminated due to the constraint condition @xmath111 . for the case with matter",
    "we have three families of the critical points    1 .",
    "@xmath112  the barotropic fluid dominated universe which is unstable if @xmath113 and stable if @xmath114 .",
    "2 .   @xmath115  the de sitter attractor ( repellor ) which is unstable if @xmath114 and stable if @xmath113 .",
    "3 .   @xmath116  it is a radiation dominated universe of the saddle type ; here are the conditions @xmath117 and @xmath118 .      from the dynamical analysis of the 3-dimensional dynamical system ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] )",
    "it is found a generic quintessence evolution scenario ( in the sense that it is realized by a very wide range of initial conditions ) . in this scenario the final state",
    "is represented by the de sitter attractor with @xmath119 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) or the einstein - de sitter universe with @xmath113 and @xmath114 respectively .",
    "therefore all roads lead to the quintessence model and give the current acceleration .",
    "let us consider the trajectory starting from the point @xmath120 then it goes to a close neighborhood of a saddle point ( a radiation dominated universe ) then approaches to stable critical point , i.e. for the @xmath114 matter dominated universe or @xmath113 de sitter state . in the latter",
    "the trajectory goes close to a barotropic fluid dominated universe ( unstable point ) before launch to the de sitter state .    for the case without the matter @xmath52 we have found the new generic quintessence scenario which appears only for non - vanishing coupling constant . in this scenario in the phase variables ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) trajectories spend long time in the neighborhood of the saddle and then escape to the de sitter attractor which leads to accelerated expansion .",
