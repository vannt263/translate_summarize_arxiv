    "the scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) is a useful tool to study surfaces at the atomic level .",
    "it allows to probe the local density of states of the material through the tunneling current @xcite , but it can also be used to move atoms@xcite or a nanoscale object on a surface , for example a carbon nanotube@xcite . the proximity of an electrical charged stm tip is not without consequences on the electronic properties of the nano - object or of the surface@xcite .",
    "ab - initio approaches treating the tip plus the sample as a single system and including the tip - sample interaction have been developed@xcite . however , most of these studies require the use of approximate schemes ( such as density functional theory ) .",
    "the aim of our work is to study the effect of a stm tip on a one - dimensional system where coulomb interactions are strong  a luttinger liquid quantum wire  with potential applications to carbon nanotube experiments .",
    "one way to model the effect of the stm tip on the electronic structure of the quantum wire is to consider the tip as an impurity .",
    "the presence of a charged impurity near or in a quantum wire leads to screening effects .",
    "while the thomas - fermi approximation@xcite can be used , it is restricted to a gas of free electrons , and therefore does not apply for a 1d strongly correlated system .",
    "screening in an interacting wire can be treated by bosonization .",
    "it has been shown that the electroneutrality is insured when charges induced on nearby gates are taken into account@xcite .",
    "a similar study was performed for metallic carbon nanotubes@xcite .",
    "the explicit screening by external gates has also been considered@xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that a metallic carbon nanotube can screen a charged impurity , while a semiconducting nanotube cannot@xcite .",
    "the effect of a single impurity in a quantum wire has been widely studied@xcite .",
    "but most of these studies are limited to perturbative calculations because of the @xmath1 term that appears due to backscattering by the impurity .",
    "another consequence of the presence of an impurity is the appearance of friedel oscillations .",
    "such friedel oscillations have been considered for impurity in quantum wire@xcite and the specificity for one - dimensional systems , in comparison to 2d or 3d systems , has been studied@xcite .",
    "exact calculations@xcite can be performed in the case where the coulomb interactions parameter @xmath2 .    here",
    "we model the stm tip + wire system with the help of the tomonaga - luttinger liquid theory@xcite which allows to take both the interactions between electrons in the wire and the screening by the tip into account .",
    "the electrostatic interaction between the tip and the wire depends on the densities of the two sub - systems .",
    "in the wire , the density operator contains a slowly varying part as well as an oscillatory component which gives rise to backscattering .",
    "the latter contribution can be argued not to be relevant , which means that we are able to obtain non perturbative results for screening from the slowly varying contribution . the full hamiltonian is quadratic even in the presence of the electrostatic interaction , but the screening interaction breaks translational invariance in the wire .",
    "the strategy of our work is to use this particularity in order to determine the exact green s function of the wire in the presence of the tip and next , and to calculate the spectral properties and the transport properties of the whole system .",
    "the spectral function is a useful tool in order to probe the electronic properties of a device , for example , the photoemission and inverse photoemission spectra can be interpreted to check the luttinger liquid behavior of a quantum wire@xcite .",
    "it is well known that the weak dimensionality of a quantum wire or a carbon nanotube induces the appearance of the collectivization of excitations , with the respect of the spin and charge modes .",
    "this separation in terms of holons and spinons is directly viewed in the spectral function by the presence of several peaks which match to the spin - charge separation@xcite .",
    "one of the questions we want to address in this work is the effect of screening on the spectral function and on the density of states : is the spin - charge separation in the interacting wire affected by the presence of the tip ? more importantly , is the power law in the density of states modified by the presence of the tip ?",

    "ii , we present the system we have considered and the model . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the very general derivation of the dyson equations associated to the wire + stm system in the presence of screening by the electrostatic potential . in sec .",
    "iv , general expressions for the spectral properties are given .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "v , we apply our results to a specific screening potential and we give the explicit expressions of the green s functions , the spectral function and the local density of states .",
    "we discuss their behaviors as a function of the position along the wire , the value of the coulomb interaction parameter and the various energy scales / frequencies .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "technical details are given in appendices .",
    "the calculation of transport properties such as current and finite - frequency noise will be presented in a separate paper@xcite .",
    "we consider the following system : a stm tip , which can be used as a probe as well as an electron injector , is placed in the vicinity of a metallic quantum wire ( see fig .",
    "[ system ] ) .",
    "the proximity between these two sub - systems induces changes in the electronic properties of the quantum wire , so that , the total hamiltonian is composed by three parts @xmath3 .",
    "the first part describes the quantum wire as an inhomogeneous non - chiral luttinger liquid with spin degree of freedom : @xmath4~ , \\label{h_w}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the non - chiral bosonic fields which satisfy the commutation relation : @xmath7_-=\\big(i/2\\big)\\delta_{jj'}{\\mathrm{sgn}}(x - x')$ ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 is , in general , a function of the position @xmath9 along the quantum wire and is related to the strength of coulomb interactions@xcite .",
    "its value depends on the sector : @xmath10 corresponds to the charge sector and @xmath11 corresponds to the spin sector . because of @xmath12 invariant spin interactions , @xmath13 at any position .",
    "inside the wire , we have @xmath14 since we assume repulsive interaction in the one - dimensional system .",
    "@xmath15 is the zero momentum fourier transform of the interacting potential between the electrons .",
    "outside the wire , we have @xmath16 since the electrodes are normal metals with no coulomb interactions .",
    "the sector velocities are defined by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the fermi velocity of electrons in the wire .",
    "is the distance between the stm tip and the quantum wire and @xmath19 is the length which separates the wire and the gate.[system],width=188 ]    the stm tip is assumed to be a normal metal but , for convenience@xcite , it is better described with the help of luttinger liquid theory .",
    "the hamiltonian encoding the information about this chiral liquid with infinite length is @xmath20    with @xmath21 is the chiral bosonic field of the stm tip , @xmath22 is the fermi velocity of electrons in the tip and @xmath23 refers to the position with respect to the tip ( see fig  [ system ] ) .",
    "since the tip is a normal metal , its coulomb interaction parameter is equal to one and there is no renormalisation of the fermi velocity .",
    "the spin index @xmath24 allows us to consider a magnetic or non magnetic tip .",
    "+ as we consider the possible screening effects between two sub - systems , the interaction describing this proximity appears through the screening hamiltonian : @xmath25    where we identify @xmath26 as the electrostatic potential coupling the densities and resulting from the electrostatic force caused by the proximity between the stm tip and the quantum wire .",

    "the rapidly oscillating component reads : @xmath39    this is precisely the contribution which enters the expression of the backscattering potential of a localized impurity in ref .  .",
    "the bosonised version of the tip density reads : @xmath40    notice that if one wanted to model a carbon nanotube instead of a single channel quantum wire , it would be sufficient to insert in the hamiltonian two additional degrees of freedom ( denoted by the index @xmath41 in ref .",
    "): we would then have four sectors@xcite ( total charge , relative charge , total spin and relative spin ) instead of the two sectors ( charge and spin ) which we have here .",
    "the spectral properties can be calculated from the green s function of the global system . here",
    "we show that  apart from irrelevant terms which can in principle be evaluated safely within the context of perturbation theory ",
    "it is possible to obtain non perturbatively the green s function of the total system , including electrostatic screening .",
    "the first step is to write the partition function in the matsubara formalism@xcite : @xmath42&=&\\int { \\mathcal d}\\varphi_{\\uparrow}{\\mathcal d}\\varphi_{\\downarrow}{\\mathcal d}\\phi_c{\\mathcal d}\\phi_s{\\mathcal d}\\theta_c{\\mathcal d}\\theta_s e^{-\\int d\\tau ( l - l_{aux})}~,\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 is the total lagrangian of the system and @xmath44 contains auxiliary fields @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 needed to extract the green s functions , such as for example @xmath48 , through the relation : @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the time ordering operator .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ slow_fast ] ) , the total hamiltonian is quadratic in the bosonic fields , except for the presence of the @xmath51 contribution of the wire density in the screening interaction",
    ". let us discuss why we can neglect this contribution .",
    "if one integrates out the tip degrees of freedom first , the screening interaction generates an effective , retarded backscattering interaction which is a convolution of @xmath52 , @xmath53 , derivatives of the screening potentials @xmath54 , @xmath55 and the tip green s function . as is explicitly shown below ( sec .",
    "[ local_section ] ) , the screening potential varies slowly on the scale of the fermi wave length : it has a power law decay in @xmath9 . a qualitative argument",
    "to neglect this retarded backscattering interaction is to state that rapid oscillations over the effective range of @xmath56 lead to its vanishing .",
    "but one can also go further and examine the relevance of this interaction .",
    "sure , the screening potential has a power law decay , yet this decay is fast enough ",
    "@xmath57 converges  to treat the derivative of the screening potential as a delta function potential at @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , integrating out the tip leads to a backscattering interaction which is proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "now , it has been shown@xcite that the renormalization group equations for the amplitude of a backscattering potential @xmath60 ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 integers ) read : @xmath63    in particular , this is the well known result which states that single electron backscattering ( @xmath64 ) becomes relevant for repulsive interaction @xmath65 ( here @xmath13 ) .",
    "in contrast , the backscattering contribution which is generated by the screening interaction has _ two _ powers of @xmath52 .",
    "this contains contributions with @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , @xmath70 . by simple power counting",
    ", we estimate that the backscattering term is irrelevant in the renormalization group sense as long as @xmath0 . while it is true that some carbon nanotubes ( in an insulating environment ) are expected to have an interaction parameter @xmath71 as low as @xmath72@xcite , the presence of the nearby substrate / gate provides additional screening which tends to enhance @xmath71 and to bring it closer to the non interacting value @xmath37 .    for this reason , in the present calculation , only the slow component of the wire density in eq .",
    "( [ slow_fast ] ) is kept , so that the hamiltonian / lagrangian are quadratic in the bosonic fields . by integrating out the degree of freedom of the tip ( wire ) , we are thus able to extract the dyson equation of the bosonic green s functions for the wire ( tip ) .",
    "the details of the calculation are presented in appendix a.    once we integrate out the degrees of freedom of the tip , we obtain the following dyson equation for the full green s function @xmath73 of the wire in the presence of screening :    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the bare green s function of the wire ( i.e. , in the absence of screening ) , @xmath76 and @xmath77 is the bare green s function of the tip .",
    "it is important to note that the screening effects which we consider here play a role only in the charge sector , which means that all the green s functions in the spin sector ( @xmath11 ) are the same as the bare ones . in a similar way",
    ", we obtain the dyson equations associated to the green s functions of the wire @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "when we integrate over the degrees of freedom of the wire , we obtain the dyson equation for the green s function of the tip @xmath81 in the presence of screening :    @xmath82    at this stage , the dyson equations which we have obtained are very general since we do not need to specify neither the expressions of the bare green s functions , nor the nature of the potential @xmath26 describing the interaction between the quantum wire and the stm tip .",
    "they can be applied to an inhomogeneous wire ( i.e. , with a coulomb interactions parameter @xmath71 which depends of the position ) as well as to a homogenous wire .",
    "they can also be applied to a system with more degrees of freedom such as a carbon nanotube . in that case , as explained in sec .",
    "ii , it is sufficient to add an index @xmath41 to the green s functions of the wire .",
    "in this section , we give the general expressions of the spectral function and of the local density of states as a function of the bosonic green s functions in the presence of screening .      for a homogenous wire , the spectral function associated to the spin @xmath29 and the chirality @xmath83",

    "however , only the power laws associated to its singularities are modified , not the positions of the singularities ( see the dots in fig .  [ figurespec2 ] ) .",

    "<S> the screening effect due to a scanning tunneling microscope tip which is placed in the vicinity of an interacting quantum wire is considered . with the help of a bosonization procedure , we are able to determine non perturbatively the green s functions of the quantum wire in the presence of both electrostatic screening by the tip and coulomb interactions in the wire . in our approach </S>",
    "<S> we justify that the working hamiltonian of the whole system is quadratic when @xmath0 and can be solved by integration over the degrees of freedom of the tip . </S>",
    "<S> once the green s functions are known , we calculate the spectral properties . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the spectral function , as well as the tunnel density of states , is affected by the screening and that the local density of states strongly deviates from its unscreened value when the tip gets close to the wire . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we observe that the spatial extension of the deviation of the local density of states is related to both the coulomb interactions parameter and the screening strength . </S>"
