    "the term large - amplitude waves should emphasize that the wave evolution can not be described through linearized equations .",
    "for more details on the terminology of large scale waves we refer to @xcite and @xcite . in the case of a large amplitude wave ,",
    "the rest frame velocity @xmath8 of a given wavefront element ( hereinafter called `` signal '' ) depends on two quantities .",
    "first , it depends on the local magnetosonic speed @xmath9 , which is larger than in the unperturbed plasma due to the plasma compression , and is thus related to the perturbation amplitude .",
    "second , it must be taken into account that a given signal propagates through a moving plasma , since the plasma flow velocity @xmath10 associated with the perturbation amplitude is not negligible ( see fig .  [",
    "consequently , the rest frame velocity of the signal equals to @xmath11 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. , elements of larger amplitude propagate faster . due to the nonlinear evolution of the wave front , its profile steepens and after a certain time / distance a discontinuity forms , marking the onset of shock formation @xcite .",
    "generally , the dependence of @xmath9 on the perturbation amplitude can not be expressed straightforwardly . however , in the case of a low plasma - to - magnetic pressure ratio @xmath12 which is assumed here , the relationship simplifies , since the alfvn velocity @xmath13 is much larger than the sound speed , and under the frozen - in condition in the case of perpendicular wave propagation , the plasma density @xmath14 is proportional to the magnetic field strength @xmath15 , i.e.  @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite have shown that in such a situation the relationship between the local propagation speed and the amplitude becomes very simple : the local value of @xmath13 can be expressed as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the local alfvn velocity in the unperturbed plasma .",
    "bearing in mind that @xmath19 , one finally finds that the wave element propagates at the rest frame speed @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "since the phase velocity of the signal depends on its amplitude @xmath10 and the ambient alfvn velocity @xmath18 , the evolution of the wavefront depends on the spatial distribution of @xmath18 and the evolution of the amplitude .",
    "the simplest possible situation is propagation of the wave in a medium where @xmath18 is uniform .",
    "in such a case , the phase velocity changes only due to the amplitude evolution , which is governed by the energy conservation .",
    "for example , in the case of a spherically symmetric source , creating a spherically symmetric wavefront ( fig .",
    "[ sig]b ) , the amplitude is inversely proportional to the distance @xmath21 , i.e. , decreases as @xmath22 , whereas in the cylindrical symmetry it decreases as @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "note that in the case of freely - propagating shock waves ( blasts ) , the amplitude decreases also because the leading edge of the perturbation ( having the highest velocity ) propagates faster than the low - amplitude segments in the trailing edge .",
    "this causes perturbation profile broadening , which must be compensated by an amplitude decrease @xcite .    of course , in the solar corona the alfvn velocity is far from being uniform .",
    "even if the coronal structural inhomogeneities are neglected , it changes with height and depends on the distance from active regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in such a situation , where the spatial distribution of @xmath24 is generally unknown , one has to investigate the wavefront kinematics by calculating the amplitude evolution for various reasonable spatial distributions of @xmath18 .",
    "however , instead of this , we apply an analogous procedure , where we take @xmath18 uniform , and describe the signal amplitude and the phase - velocity evolution by different functional forms . in other words , instead of presuming a function that describes the change of @xmath18 with distance @xmath21 from the wave source ,",
    "we directly presume a function that describes the wave evolution .",
    "in particular , we use the power - law function @xmath25 and exponential function @xmath26 applying different decay lengths ( denoted in the power - law function by @xmath0 and in the exponential by @xmath27 ) we can reproduce a weak or strong attenuation of the signal . note that @xmath28 would represent a plane wave without decay as achieved for @xmath29 and @xmath30 . on the other hand ,",
    "large @xmath0 or small @xmath27 represents a strong attenuation .    beside the power - law and exponential function , we also employ as a kind of reference , the functions : @xmath31 and @xmath32 which describe the amplitude decrease of cylindrically and spherically symmetric sound waves , respectively .",
    "the initial amplitude of a given signal is determined by the velocity of the source surface @xmath33 . at the starting time @xmath34 when the signal is launched , @xmath35 , since the flow velocity has to be equal to the contact - surface velocity .",

    "recent observational studies showed that the magnetosonic speed @xmath9 ( we assume @xmath63 ) can drop down to a local minimum of 300500  km  s@xmath1 around the height @xmath22  r@xmath4 but then rises steadily up to a local maximum of @xmath21000  km  s@xmath1 at a height between 3 and 4  r@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained from observations of type ii bursts that on average the magnetosonic speed attains a local minimum of @xmath64400  km  s@xmath1 around 3  r@xmath4 and a broad local maximum of @xmath64500  km  s@xmath1 in the range of 46  r@xmath4 . besides , the previous cme event which started about 40  min earlier ( lasco catalogue ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from the same active region might affect the actual value of the alfvn velocity too .",
    "furthermore , we did not take into account the accurate relation between the plasma flow and source velocity @xmath10 , i.e.  the cme velocity , but simply used a one - to - one relation .",
    "we approximated @xmath10 by the cme speed which is appropriate concerning the upper part of the moving and expanding cme but does not hold for the lateral direction , i.e. , from which the gts kinematics is determined .",
    "we tried to account for this by reducing the cme speed by @xmath260% , thus maintaining the cme kinematical profile as model input but with a lower speed .",
    "however , also that option did not result in a better match between the generated gts and the observed moreton wave .",
    "an important factor for the derived model results is the decay factor used to attenuate the signal . since in the corona the distribution of density @xmath65 , magnetic field @xmath66 , and alfvn speed @xmath67",
    "are unknown , we use different `` decay functions '' ( see equ .  [ pl][spher_dec ] ) . it had to satisfy two criteria",
    ": it should be strong enough to decelerate the signal in its late propagation phase but should not , due to its strength , delay the timing of the shock formation .",
    "we used geometry dependent factors adapted from sound waves ( cylindrical and spherical ) , i.e. , without implementing a magnetic field ( for details see * ? ? ?",
    "formal decay factors , like power - law and exponential functions , were used to put the decay to the limits either having no attenuation or very strong attenuation and to account for the unknown distribution of @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite investigated the role of magnetic fields for an expanding and upward traveling cme and showed that a spherical cloud without a magnetic field drives a wave that propagates to longer distances than that with a weak open field ( see fig .  7 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this implies that the presence of a magnetic field would result in a stronger signal decay than obtained from our simple approaches . since we were not able to reproduce the wave using the limits for the decay factor ( strong versus no attenuation ) , we suppose that even utilizing more sophisticated decay factors , the disturbance generated by the cme forehead would not be able to reproduce the observed moreton wave .",
    "using the observed cme kinematics as input parameters the model could not reproduce the general characteristics of the observed moreton wave .",
    "the timing of the shock formation ( `` knee '' ) was not appropriate but occurred later than the first observed moreton wave front .",
    "the velocity profile was not conform and the final velocity was too high in comparison to the observed moreton wave . by varying the initial source size as well as the behavior during the source evolution ( bow , piston or combined bow / piston driver ) ,",
    "the gts kinematics was shifted to a larger or smaller propagation distance , however , the shock formation always appeared too late ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "similar results are obtained by applying different start times for the signal @xmath41 and different local alfvn velocities @xmath18 .",
    "thus , experimenting with all these different parameters demonstrated that the moreton wave could not be reproduced when taking the kinematics of the radial outward movement of the cme as input for the model .",
    "this finally pushed us to use synthetic kinematics in order to imitate other possible drivers for the signal .",
    "so far it was clearly derived from the model that the source expansion needs to be more impulsive ( early shock formation ) . for synthetic kinematics of stronger and shorter acceleration of the source surface expansion ( 3-d piston type )",
    "we found a good match between the model generated signal and the observed moreton wave .",
    "the timing of the shock formation is , when using these kinematical profiles , in good agreement with the appearance of the first moreton wave front . using an exponential attenuation factor ( see equ .",
    "[ expon ] ) with short signal decay lengths the best match to the observed moreton wave could be found . on average",
    "the alfvn mach number @xmath68 from such synthetic kinematics are within the range of @xmath691.53 which agrees with observed alfvn mach numbers for moreton waves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the initial source size and its expansion dimension that is necessary to mimic the observed moreton wave can be interpreted as the laterally expanding cme flanks or the volume expansion of the flare .",
    "@xcite concluded from a 2d magnetohydrodynamic simulations that for the driver of a moreton wave a high acceleration during a short time interval is necessary .",
    "this was interpreted to require a strong lateral expansion , either lift - off of an over - pressured flux rope or thermal explosion - kind of energy release .",
    "likewise , @xcite obtained from a 3d analytical model that a short acceleration phase up to high velocities ( @xmath21000  km  s@xmath1 ) within a low alfvn velocity environment is necessary to create a shock that is capable of causing type ii bursts in the dm / m wavelength range and h@xmath0 moreton waves .",
    "concluding , for the january 17 , 2005 event under study it is unlikely that the bow shock of the cme generated the observed moreton wave .",
    "the cme is a too gradually accelerating source in the lift - off phase and a too fast one in the later evolution phase to cause the observed moreton wave kinematics .",
    "an impulsively accelerated expansion of a source surface acting as a temporary piston would be a more appropriate mechanism to generate the observed moreton wave .",
    "possible driving mechanisms would be the laterally expanding cme flanks or the impulsive volume expansion of the flare .",
    "the latter scenario would be in accordance with the flare initiated `` blast wave '' scenario proposed from observational results for the kinematics of moreton waves ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but in contrast to the numerical model by @xcite who claimed that moreton waves correspond to the piston - driven shock over the cme .",
    "for the future it would be important to have more such complete data sets including both , observations from the early cme evolution ( upward moving front as well as expanding flanks ) and detailed observations of moreton waves , in order to validate the presented results .",
