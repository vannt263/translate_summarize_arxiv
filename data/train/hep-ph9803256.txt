    "since its discovery in 1974 , the @xmath0 meson has provided a useful laboratory for quantitatively testing quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and , in particular , the interplay of perturbative and nonperturbative phenomena .",
    "recently , the cross section of inclusive @xmath0 hadroproduction measured in @xmath7 collisions at the fermilab tevatron @xcite turned out to be more than one order of magnitude in excess of what used to be the best theoretical prediction @xcite , based on the colour - singlet model ( csm ) .",
    "as a solution to this puzzle , bodwin , braaten , and lepage @xcite proposed the existence of so - called colour - octet processes to fill the gap .",
    "the central idea is that @xmath1 pairs are produced at short distances in colour - octet states and subsequently evolve into physical ( colour - singlet ) charmonia by the nonperturbative emission of soft gluons .",
    "the underlying theoretical framework is provided by nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) endowed with a particular factorization hypothesis , which implies a separation of short - distance coefficients , which are amenable to perturbative qcd , from long - distance matrix elements , which must be extracted from experiment .",
    "this formalism involves a double expansion in the strong coupling constant @xmath8 and the relative velocity @xmath9 of the bound @xmath10 quarks , and takes the complete structure of the charmonium fock space into account .    in order to convincingly establish the phenomenological significance of the colour - octet mechanism ,",
    "it is indispensable to identify it in other kinds of high - energy experiments as well . in the meantime ,",
    "there have been a number of interesting proposals and encouraging results concerning possible colour - octet signatures of inclusive @xmath0 production in @xmath11 annihilation in the continuum @xcite and on the @xmath12-boson resonance @xcite , hadronic collisions in the fixed - target mode @xcite , @xmath13-meson decays @xcite , and photoproduction in the forward direction @xcite and at finite transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "although the experimental @xmath12-boson - decay data from cern lep @xcite are in agreement with the predicted colour - octet signature , they do not exclude the hypothesis that the observed prompt charmonium signal is produced by colour - singlet processes alone .    in the case of inelastic @xmath0 photoproduction , however , nrqcd with colour - octet matrix elements tuned @xcite to fit the tevatron data @xcite predicts @xcite at leading order ( lo ) a distinct rise in cross section as @xmath14 , where @xmath5 is the fraction of the photon energy transferred to the @xmath0 meson in the proton rest frame , which is not observed by the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite collaborations at desy hera .",
    "this colour - octet charmonium anomaly has cast doubts on the validity of the nrqcd factorization hypothesis @xcite , which seems so indispensible to interpret the tevatron data in a meaningful way .",
    "this paper is an attempt to rescue the nrqcd approach by approximately taking into account dominant higher - order ( ho ) qcd effects .",
    "the basic idea is as follows .",
    "the predicted excess over the hera data at @xmath5 close to unity is chiefly generated by colour - octet @xmath1 pairs in the states @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 @xcite , where we use the spectroscopic notation @xmath18 to indicate the spin @xmath19 , the orbital angular momentum @xmath20 , and the total angular momentum @xmath21 .",
    "on the other hand , in hadroproduction at the tevatron , the contributions from the colour - octet @xmath15 and @xmath3 states fall off much more strongly with increasing @xmath22 than the one due to the colour - octet @xmath23 state @xcite , which is greatly suppressed in the quasi - elastic limit of photoproduction @xcite .",
    "consequently , the nonperturbative matrix elements which are responsible for the colour - octet charmonium crisis are essentially fixed by the tevatron data in the low-@xmath22 regime .",
    "this is precisely where the lo approximation used in ref .",
    "@xcite is expected to become unreliable due to multiple - gluon radiation from the initial and final states . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this phenomenon was carefully analyzed in a monte carlo framework and found to significantly increase the lo cross section . in this paper",
    ", we perform fits to the latest prompt @xmath0 data taken by the cdf collaboration @xcite at the tevatron incorporating this information @xcite on the dominant ho qcd effects .",
    "we then update the nrqcd predictions for inelastic @xmath0 photoproduction at hera to find out whether the colour - octet charmonium anomaly persists .",
    "we also carry out a lo analysis for @xmath0 mesons originating from the radiative feed down of promptly produced @xmath6 mesons .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s2 ] , we specify the theoretical input for our analysis . in section  [ s3 ] ,",
    "we describe our fitting procedure and present our results for the various @xmath0 and @xmath6 matrix elements . in section  [ s4 ]",
    ", we present the resulting predictions for inelastic @xmath0 and @xmath6 photoproduction at hera .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  [ s5 ] .",
    "we now describe the theoretical framework for our analysis .",
    "we calculate the cross section for the inclusive production @xmath24 of the physical charmonium state @xmath25 in the collision of two hadrons , @xmath26 and @xmath13 , in the parton model of qcd , i.e.  @xmath26 and @xmath13 are represented by their parton density functions ( pdf s ) . in the case of photoproduction , @xmath26 is a quasi - real photon , which either directly interacts with the partons inside hadron @xmath13 ( direct photoproduction ) or fluctuates into a bunch of quarks and gluons , which in turn interact with the partons inside hadron @xmath13 , while the photon remnants give rise to hadronic activity in the original photon flight direction ( resolved photoproduction ) .",
    "depending on the transverse momentum @xmath22 of the @xmath25 meson , we adopt two different pictures to describe its production . for @xmath22 values of the order of the charmonium mass @xmath27",
    ", we consider the formation of a collinear @xmath1 pair within the primary hard - scattering process ( fusion ) . in the limit @xmath28",
    ", only those subprocesses survive where the @xmath1 pair is created from a single high - energy gluon , charm quark or antiquark which is close to its mass shell ( fragmentation ) .",
    "it is then useful to describe this two - step process as a convolution of the hard - scattering cross section for single - parton production with an appropriate fragmentation function ( ff ) . in both cases ,",
    "the factorization theorem of nrqcd @xcite allows for a systematical treatment of the transition from the @xmath1 pair , in state @xmath29 , to the physical @xmath25 meson .",
    "the states @xmath30,[\\,\\underline{8},{}^{2s+1}\\!l_j]$ ] , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 indicate the colour multiplicity , span the whole @xmath1 fock space .",
    "this formalism comprises a separation of short - distance parts , which are amenable to perturbative qcd , from long - distance matrix elements @xmath33\\right\\rangle$ ] , which must be extracted from experiment . in the case of fusion ,",

    "the coefficient @xmath44 at the initial scale @xmath45 involves only momenta of order @xmath46 , and can thus be calculated within nrqcd in powers of @xmath47 .",
    "the evolution of the ff @xmath48 up to higher fragmentation scales @xmath49 is ruled by the timelike altarelli - parisi ( ap ) equations , which may be conveniently solved in @xmath43 space @xcite .    the relative importance of the various terms in eqs .",

    "[ f3](b ) and ( c ) , this contribution is also responsible for the significant excess of the lo predictions over the experimental results for @xmath152 and @xmath153 at low @xmath22 and high @xmath5 , respectively .",

    "this observation was assessed in the zeus publication @xcite by the statement that _ the predictions of a specific leading - order colour - octet model , as formulated to describe the cdf data on @xmath0 hadroproduction , are not consistent with the data . _ to our mind , the salient point is that those predictions were made on the basis of lo fits to the cdf data .",
    "it is crucial to notice that the colour - octet contribution of direct photoproduction is essentially due the @xmath69 $ ] , @xmath105 $ ] , and @xmath106 $ ] channels @xcite and thus proportional to @xmath129 . in section  [ s3 ] , we have seen that the fit result for @xmath129 is greatly reduced by the inclusion of ho qcd effects on hadroproduction at low @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this nourishes the hope that the apparent discrepancy between theory and experiment at hera may thus be alleviated at higher orders .    in figs .",
    "[ f4](a)(c ) , we take a first step towards a full nlo description of the hera data on inelastic @xmath0 photoproduction by repeating the analyses of figs .",

    "( [ fus ] ) as already mentioned in section  [ s2 ] , they are unknown , except for direct photoproduction in the csm @xcite . in the latter case , they were found to moderately increase the cross section , by about 20% @xcite .",
    "we observe that the ho - improved predictions tend to undershoot the data leaving room for a substantial @xmath98 factor due to the missing nlo corrections to the partonic cross sections in eq .",
    "( [ fus ] ) .",
    "now , the colour - singlet contribution of direct photoproduction , which is well under theoretical control @xcite , is by far dominant , except in the corners of phase space , at @xmath154 and @xmath155 , where the colour - octet contributions of resolved and direct photoproduction , respectively , take over .",
    "it has been noticed @xcite that special care must be exercised in the treatment of the latter contributions . in the vicinity of the upper endpoint , ho",
    "nonperturbative contributions are enhanced and lead to a breakdown of the nrqcd expansion , so that only an average cross section over a sufficiently large region close to @xmath156 can be predicted @xcite . on the other hand , one my infer from the study of resolved @xmath0 photoproduction via fragmentation",
    "@xcite that the corresponding partonic cross sections in eq .",
    "( [ fus ] ) are likely to receive significant nlo corrections at low @xmath5 . of course",

    "finally , we present lo predictions for the inclusive photoproduction of @xmath6 mesons with subsequent radiative feed down to @xmath0 mesons .",

    "[ f3](a ) and ( b ) , we see that , after integration over @xmath5 , this indirect source of @xmath0 mesons is suppressed by roughly two orders of magnitude relative to prompt @xmath0 production .",
    "we determined the @xmath0 colour - octet matrix elements which appear in the nrqcd expansion @xcite at leading order in @xmath9 by fitting the latest tevatron data of prompt @xmath0 hadroproduction @xcite .",
    "we found that the result for the linear combination @xmath129 of @xmath59\\right\\rangle$ ] and @xmath122\\right\\rangle$ ] is substantially reduced if the ho qcd effects due to the multiple emission of gluons , which had been estimated by monte carlo techniques @xcite , are taken into account .",
    "as an important consequence , the intriguing excess of the lo nrqcd prediction for inelastic @xmath0 photoproduction at @xmath5 close to unity @xcite over the hera measurements @xcite disappears .",
    "we assess this finding as an indication that it is premature to proclaim an experimental falsification of the nrqcd framework on the basis of the hera data .",
    "although we believe that our analysis captures the main trend of the ho improvement , we stress that it is still at an exploratory level , since a number of ingredients which would be necessary for a fully consistent nlo treatment of inclusive @xmath0 hadroproduction and photoproduction are still missing .",
