    "in addition to the results from vera , we compiled data from five published sources ( s  crb , u  her , rr  aql , w  hya , and r  cas ) whose parallaxes were measured with astrometric vlbi observations using the very long baseline array ( vlba ) , and we presented them also in the lower half of table  [ parallax_vera3 ] .",
    "we estimated the @xmath82 errors of all sources assuming that the errors can be attributed to only the distance uncertainties .",
    "we define the plr in the form of @xmath83 .",
    "since it is difficult to determine the slope of the plr using a small number of sample , we adopted the slope of @xmath84 which was obtained from the relation in lmc @xcite .",

    "fitting results from two sample sets ( all ten sources and five vera sources ) become close to each other because the @xmath82 error of t  lep is very small and a weighting of this source is large in the fittings . using the five sources from vera observations",

    "u@xmath109 is the velocity radially toward to the galactic center , v@xmath109 is in the direction of the galactic circular rotation , and w@xmath109 is in the direction to the north galactic pole , perpendicular to the galactic plane . in the conversion procedure , we adopted @xmath110 220 kms@xmath2 ( iau recommendation ) as the circular rotation velocity of the lsr .",
    "the same value was used as t  lep s circular rotation velocity .",
    "we also adopted a value of 8.5 kpc ( iau recommendation ) for the galacto - centric distance of the sun . in a detailed study by @xcite ,",
    "the solar motion was reported to be ( u@xmath5 , v@xmath5 , w@xmath5 ) @xmath14 ( 7.5@xmath01.0 , 13.5@xmath00.3 , 6.8@xmath00.1)kms@xmath2 , we used these values in our analysis .    in the calculation of the three - dimensional kinematics of t  lep",
    ", we used the systemic proper motion of ( @xmath111 , @xmath112)@xmath14(14.60@xmath00.50 , @xmath335.43@xmath00.79 ) masyr@xmath2 and the lsr velocity @xmath327.63 kms@xmath2 which was the center velocity of the maser spots shown in table  [ maser_table ] .",
    "the resultant peculiar motion of t  lep was obtained to be ( u@xmath109 , v@xmath109 , w@xmath109 ) @xmath14 ( 57.96 , @xmath336.14 , 14.67)kms@xmath2 .",
    "this shows a large discrepancy from the assumed circular rotation , indicating an inward motion to the galactic center , a large delay from the circular rotation , and a northward motion from the galactic plane .",
    "however , the individual peculiar motion of t  lep is consistent with the results published in @xcite which also indicates inward motions to the galactic center and a delay from the galactic rotation , which represents a different trend from the statistic properties of variable stars with similar periods in @xcite .",
    "the obtained peculiar motion of t  lep is indicated with a white arrow at the top - right of figure  [ map ] .",
    "the direction parallel to the galactic plane is also shown with another white arrow at same position in figure  [ map ] , where the galactic longitude @xmath113 increases toward the south - east of this map .",
    "if we assume that the inter stellar medium ( ism ) is fixed with regards to local circular rotation , the peculiar motion can be treated as a source motion relative to the ism . in this picture",
    ", the linear velocity of t  lep relative to the ism is obtained to be 69.86kms@xmath2 , which is the root sum square of the three components of peculiar motion .",
    "recently , evidence of the interaction between the ism and circumstellar medium ( csm ) of evolved stars was detected in infrared images @xcite .",
    "clear images of bow shocks in many sources are reported and these bow shocks often appear in front of the source proper motion . since t  lep is an evolved star with a high mass - loss rate , we can expect a bow shock or dust shell around t  lep . up to now , there is no publication similar to the works of @xcite or @xcite showing the infrared image around t  lep . in the near future",
    ", we expect the detection of a bow shock that indicates clear consistency with our kinematic estimation .",
    "phase referencing vlbi observations with vera towards t  lep allowed for the evaluation of a precise distance estimate , based on the measurement of annual parallax .",
    "the obtained parallax of 3.06@xmath00.04mas corresponds to a distance of 327@xmath04.3 pc .",
    "we revealed the distribution of maser spots in an area of 110 mas @xmath7 50 mas , and the internal kinematics of maser spots showed an outward motion from the distribution center . using the obtained systemic proper motion of t  lep ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) @xmath14 ( 14.60@xmath00.50 , @xmath335.43@xmath00.79 ) masyr@xmath2 and lsr velocity of @xmath327.63 kms@xmath2 , we deduced a peculiar motion of ( u@xmath109 , v@xmath109 , w@xmath109 ) @xmath14 ( 57.96 , @xmath336.14 , 14.67)kms@xmath2 , assuming circular rotation at the source local position .",
    "this shows a large discrepancy from the assumed circular rotation .",
    "we superimposed an image of the h@xmath1o masers from this work with an interferometric infrared image of t  lep .",
    "for the position of the central star , we assumed an estimated position from our maser distribution and kinematic analysis . using the obtained distance of 327 pc",
    ", the angular radius of the molecular shell ( 7.5 mas ) and photosphere ( 2.9 mas ) revealed with the vlti by @xcite were converted to the linear scales of 2.45 au and 0.95 au , respectively .    for the determination of the galactic plr ,",
