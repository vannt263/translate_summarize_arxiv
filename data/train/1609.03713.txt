    "the revelation principle plays an important role in microeconomics theory and has been applied to many other fields such as auction theory , mechanism design _ etc_. according to the wide - spread textbook given by mas - colell , whinston and green ( page 884 , line 24 @xcite ) : `` _ _ the implication of the revelation principle is _ _ ... _ to identify the set of implementable social choice functions in bayesian nash equilibrium , we need only identify those that are truthfully implementable_. '' related definitions about the revelation principle can be seen in appendix , which are cited from section 23.b and 23.d of mwg s textbook@xcite .    generally speaking , some costs are required for a social choice function to be implemented by a mechanism .",
    "there are two different kinds of costs possibly occurred in a mechanism : 1 ) _ strategy costs _ , which are possibly occurred when agents play strategies ; and 2 ) _ misreporting costs _ , which are possibly occurred when agents report types falsely . in the traditional literature of mechanism design ,",
    "costs are usually referred to the former .",
    "recently , some researchers began to investigate misreporting costs .",
    "for every type @xmath0 and every type @xmath1 an agent might misreport , kephart and conitzer @xcite defined a cost function as @xmath2 for doing so .",
    "traditional mechanism design is just the case where @xmath3 everywhere , and partial verification is a special case where @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "kephart and conitzer @xcite proposed that when reporting truthfully is costless and misreporting can be costly , the revelation principle can fail to hold .    despite these accomplishments , so far people seldom consider the two different kinds of costs simultaneously .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the justification of revelation principle when both of two kinds of costs are considered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we construct a labor model , then define a social choice function @xmath5 and an indirect mechanism , in which agents strategies are costly . in section 3 ,",
    "we prove @xmath5 can be implemented by the indirect mechanism in bayesian nash equilibrium . in section 4",
    ", we propose a strategy cost property and point out that the revelation principle may not hold even if misreporting costs are zero and only strategy costs occur . in section 5",
    ", we prove that @xmath5 is not truthfully implementable in bayesian nash equilibrium , which contradicts the revelation principle",
    ". finally , section 6 draws conclusions .",
    "here we construct a labor model which uses some ideas from the first - price sealed auction model in example 23.b.5 @xcite and the signaling model @xcite .",
    "there are one firm and two workers .",
    "worker 1 and worker 2 differ in the number of units of output they produce if hired by the firm , which is denoted by productivity type .",
    "the firm wants to hire a worker with productivity as high as possible , and the two workers compete for this job offer .    for simplicity , we make the following assumptions : + 1 ) the possible productivity types of two workers are : @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 .",
    "each worker @xmath9 s productivity type @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is his private information .",
    "+ 2 ) there is a certification that the firm can announce as a hire criterion .",
    "the education level corresponding to the certification is @xmath12 .",
    "each worker decides by himself whether to get the certification or not , hence the possible education levels are @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "each worker @xmath9 s education level @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is observable to the firm .",
    "education does nothing for a worker s productivity .",
    "+ 3 ) the strategy cost of obtaining education @xmath15 for a worker @xmath9 ( @xmath16 ) of productivity type @xmath10 is given by a function @xmath17 .",
    "that is , the strategy cost is lower for a high - productivity worker .",
    "+ 4 ) the misreporting cost for a low - productivity worker to report the high productivity type @xmath7 is a fixed value @xmath18 . in addition , a high - productivity worker is assumed to report the low productivity type @xmath6 with zero cost .",
    "the labor model s outcome is represented by a vector @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the probability that worker @xmath9 gets the job offer with wage @xmath21 which is chosen by the firm .",
    "recall that the firm does not know the exact productivity types of two workers , but its aim is to hire a worker with productivity as high as possible .",
    "this aim can be represented by a social choice function @xmath22 , in which @xmath23 , @xmath24    in order to implement the above @xmath25 , the firm designs an indirect mechanism @xmath26 as follows : for each worker @xmath16 , conditional on his type @xmath27 , he chooses the education level as a bid @xmath28 . the strategy set @xmath29 is the set of all possible bids , and the outcome function @xmath30 is defined as : @xmath31 where @xmath32 ( @xmath11 ) is the probability that worker @xmath9 gets the job offer .",
    "let @xmath33 be the utility of the firm , and @xmath34 be the utilities of worker @xmath35 in the indirect mechanism @xmath36 respectively , then @xmath37 , and for @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 the item `` @xmath41 '' occurred in eq ( 3 ) is just the strategy cost paid by agent @xmath9 of type @xmath10 when he performs the strategy @xmath42 in the indirect mechanism .",

    "therefore , the strategy profile @xmath77 is a bayesian nash equilibrium of the game induced by @xmath36 .",

    "before discussing the truthful implementation problem of a costly bayesian implementable social choice function , we first cite the basic idea behind the revelation principle given in mwg s textbook ( page 884 , line 16 , @xcite ) : `` if in mechanism @xmath83 , each agent finds that , when his type is @xmath10 , choosing @xmath84 is his best response to the other agents strategies , then if we introduce mediator who says ` _ _ tell me your type _ _ , @xmath10 , _ and i will play _",
    "_ for you _ '",
    ", each agent will find truth telling to be an optimal strategy given that all other agents tell the truth .",
    "that is , truth telling will be a bayesian nash equilibrium of this direct revelation game '' .",
    "although this basic idea looks reasonable , we propose that behind the mediator s announcement `` _ _ tell me your type _ _ , @xmath10 , _ i will play _",
    "_ for you _ ''",
    ", an assumption should be added to make this announcement _ credible _ : after receiving each agent @xmath9 s report @xmath10 ( @xmath85 ) , in order to be able to play @xmath84 for agent @xmath9 , the mediator should also pay the strategy cost which would be paid by agent @xmath9 himself when carrying out @xmath84 in the original mechanism .    generally speaking",
    ", the strategy costs can be thought of as financial costs or efforts paid by agents when carrying out their strategies .",
    "according to mwg s textbook ( page 883 , line 7 @xcite ) , agents strategies are either possible actions or plans of actions .",
    "no matter which format the agents strategies might be , if the strategy costs occurred in the original mechanism can not be ignored , then only when such assumption holds will the mediator s announcement be credible to the agents .",
    "otherwise none of agents is willing to attend the direct mechanism , which means the direct mechanism can not start up .",
    "however , the so - called `` mediator '' is a virtual role which does not exist at all .",
    "it is _ unreasonable _ to assume that the nonexistent``mediator '' pay the strategy costs for agents .",
    "hence , the above explanation of the revelation principle using the virtual `` mediator '' is _ wrong _ when agents strategies are costly . according to definition 23.b.5 ( see appendix ) ,",
    "the only _ legal _ action for each agent @xmath9 in the direct mechanism is just to report a type @xmath10 ( which means that @xmath84 is illegal for agent @xmath9 ) , and the outcome function is just the social choice function . from the perspective of agents , the above - mentioned result is formalized as the following strategy cost property :    * strategy cost property * : _ in the direct mechanism , each agent only reports a type and will not pay the strategy cost which would be paid by himself when playing strategies in the original indirect mechanism_.    the strategy cost property can be understood by proof of contradiction .",
    "reconsider the example in section 2 .",
    "suppose there are two different kinds of certifications from which the firm can choose one as a hire criterion , and the education levels corresponding to the two certifications are different : @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "hence , after the firm announces a certification , by eq ( 3 ) and eq ( 7 ) each agent in the indirect mechanism will know which kind of strategy cost he should pay in bayesian equilibrium : @xmath88 or @xmath89 .",
    "now assume that each agent will still pay the strategy cost in the direct mechanism . then after each agent reports a type to the firm , the firm performs the outcome function which is just the social choice function @xmath5 .",
    "since there is no certification used in the direct mechanism , it is impossible for each agent @xmath9 to know which kind of strategy cost he should pay : @xmath88 or @xmath89 .",
    "this is the contradiction .",
    "consequently , the strategy cost property holds .",
    "one possible question to the strategy cost property is as follows : + _ q1 : _ the designer may define the direct mechanism more generally . in particular , the designer defines a new mechanism in which each agent reports his type , then the mechanism suggest to them which action to take , and the final outcome of the mechanism depends on both the report and the action ( _ i.e. _ , education level ) .",
    "+ _ a1 : _ this new mechanism is irrelevant to the direct mechanism . by definition 23.b.5 ( see appendix ) , the final outcome of the direct mechanism only depends on agents reports , and the designer must perform the outcome function after receiving agents reports .",
    "it is _ illegal _ to assume that the designer can send action advices to agents in the direct mechanism .    besides the above question ,",
    "another possible objection to the strategy cost property is as follows : `` let us consider the equilibrium in the indirect mechanism . given the equilibrium , there is a mapping from vectors of agents types into outcomes . now let us take that mapping to be a revelation game",
    ". it will be the case that no type of any agent can make an announcement that differs from his true type and do better '' .",
    "it can be seen that this objection is equivalent to the proof of revelation principle ( see appendix proposition 23.d.1 ) .",
    "suppose the strategy costs can not be neglected in the indirect mechanism , let us make a detailed investigation on the proof of proposition 23.d.1 . given that an indirect mechanism @xmath36 implements @xmath5 costly in bayesian nash equilibrium , consider the equilibrium @xmath90 in eq ( 23.d.2 ) , there is a mapping @xmath91 from a vector of agents types @xmath92 into an outcome @xmath93 , which is equal to the desired outcome @xmath25 for all @xmath94 .",
    "note that in eq ( 23.d.2 ) and eq ( 23.d.3 ) , the indirect mechanism @xmath36 works , and the utility function @xmath95 of agent @xmath9 ( @xmath85 ) already reflects the fact that each agent @xmath9 pays the strategy cost related to @xmath84 by himself .",
    "now let us take the mapping @xmath96 to be a direct revelation game , in which the strategy set of agent @xmath9 is his type set , @xmath97 , and the designer carries out the outcome function @xmath98 . in this revelation game",
    ", each agent @xmath9 only reports a type and does not pay the strategy cost except for some possible misreporting cost , thus _ the utility function of each agent _ @xmath9 _ in the direct mechanism should be changed from original _ @xmath95 _ to another function _",
    "@xmath99 , _ in which the item related to strategy cost disappears_. in the direct mechanism is changed from eq ( 3 ) to eq ( 10 ) and eq ( 11 ) , in which the item related to the strategy cost `` @xmath41 '' disappears . ]    as a result , given that an indirect mechanism implements @xmath5 costly in bayesian nash equilibrium , in order to judge whether @xmath5 is truthfully implementable in bayesian nash equilibrium or not , we should use the new utility function @xmath99 instead of @xmath95 for each agent @xmath9 . to be more precisely , the criterion to judge whether @xmath5 is truthfully implementable should be updated from eq ( 23.d.1 ) ( see appendix ) to judge whether for all @xmath100 and all @xmath101 , @xmath102    \\geq    e_{\\theta_{-i}}[u'_{i}(f(\\hat{\\theta}_{i},\\theta_{-i}),\\theta_{i})|\\theta_{i}],\\ ] ] for all @xmath103 ,",
    "in which @xmath99 is the utility function of agent @xmath9 in the direct mechanism , and is not equal to @xmath95 in the original indirect mechanism .",
    "therefore , the last sentence of the proof of proposition 23.d.1 ( see appendix ) is _ wrong _ since eq ( 23.d.4 ) is no longer the condition for @xmath5 to be truthfully implementable in bayesian nash equilibrium when strategies in the indirect mechanism are costly .",
    "furthermore , with the new utility function @xmath99 , some agent @xmath9 may find it beneficial for him to differ from his true type @xmath10 to another false type @xmath104",
    ". finds it beneficial to misreport @xmath105 in the direct mechanism under the condition of @xmath106 , no matter what his true type is . ]",
    "put differently , in the direct mechanism there may exists some agent @xmath107 , @xmath108 such that @xmath102 < e_{\\theta_{-i}}[u'_{i}(f(\\hat{\\theta}_{i},\\theta_{-i}),\\theta_{i})|\\theta_{i}],\\ ] ] which contradicts eq ( 9 ) .    to sum up",
    ", the strategy cost property is the cornerstone for the direct revelation mechanism to start up .",
    "however , as we pointed out , _ it is the strategy cost property itself that may change agents utility functions in the direct mechanism_. consequently , a costly bayesian implementable social choice function may not be truthfully implementable , which contradicts the revelation principle .",
    "note that in this section , only the strategy costs are considered and the misreporting costs has nothing to do with the conclusion .",
    "put differently , the revelation principle may not hold even if the misreporting costs are zero and only the agents strategies are costly .",
    "an example will be shown in section 5 .",
    "* proposition 2 : * if the misreporting cost @xmath106 , the social choice function @xmath25 given in eq ( 1 ) is not truthfully implementable in bayesian nash equilibrium . + * proof : * consider the direct revelation mechanism @xmath109 , in which @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "the timing steps of @xmath112 are as follows : + 1 ) each worker @xmath9 ( @xmath16 ) with true type @xmath10 reports a type @xmath103 to the firm . here",

    "consequently , @xmath120 ( for all @xmath101 , @xmath11 ) is not a bayesian nash equilibrium of the direct revelation mechanism under the condition of @xmath106 , and hence the social choice function @xmath25 is not truthfully implementable in bayesian nash equilibrium . @xmath82",
    "in this paper , we discuss the justification of revelation principle through a simple labor model in which agents pay strategy costs during the process of an indirect mechanism .",
    "the main characteristics of the labor model are as follows : 1 ) agents strategies are costly in the indirect mechanism , _",
    "i.e. _ , worker with type @xmath7 ( or @xmath6 ) will pay the strategy cost @xmath121 ( or @xmath122 ) when obtaining education level @xmath13 ; 2 ) the productivity type of worker is private information and not observable to the firm ; 3 ) misreporting a higher type is also costly , _ i.e. _ , a low - productivity worker can pretend to be a high - productivity worker with the misreporting cost @xmath114 .",
    "the major difference between this paper and traditional literature is just the strategy cost property proposed in section 4 . by the strategy cost property ,",
    "when strategies in the indirect mechanism are costly , the utility function of agents will be changed in the direct mechanism .",
    "hence , the criterion to judge whether @xmath5 is truthfully implementable in bayesian nash equilibrium will also be changed .",
