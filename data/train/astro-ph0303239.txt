    "deep surveys carried out in the last decade or so have unveiled a vast population of low surface brightness disk galaxies ( lsbs ) that range from dwarf to fairly luminous galaxies and even giant spirals ( bothun , impey & malin 1986;bothun et al .",
    "1987 ; schombert et al.1992 ; impey et al .",
    "typical lsbs are late - type objects characterized by blue colors , low metallicity , very high gas fractions and low levels of star formation activity .",
    "more recently , a new class of gas - rich , late - type red lsb galaxies has been discovered ( oneil et al . 2000 ) together with another population of red , early - type lsbs ( bejersbergen , de blok & van der hulst 1999 ; galaz et al .",
    "some of the red lsbs have metallicities close to the solar value ( bergmann , jorgensen & hill 2002 ) .",
    "hence lsbs probably span a range of properties comparable to `` normal '' high surface brightness spiral galaxies ( hsbs ) .",
    "the high gas fractions of lsbs suggest that they are quite unevolved objects with very low past and present star formation rates .",
    "the low metallicity ( de blok & van der hulst 1998a , b ) and the low gas surface densities ( de blok , mcgaugh & van der hulst 1996a ) can explain the low star formation rates of blue lsbs ( gerritsen & de blok 1997 ; van den hoek et al .",
    "the fact that lsbs and hsbs seem to follow the same tully - fisher relation ( zwaan et al . 1995 ; mcgaugh et al .",
    "2000 ) implies that the former have much higher dark matter contents than the latter within the region typically probed by the observations ( of order of a few disk scale lengths ) .",
    "this conclusion stems from the low stellar mass - to - light ratios suggested by the blue colors of most lsbs .",
    "the latter imply that the low surface brightness is really the product of a low stellar surface density ( de blok , van der hulst & mcgaugh 1996b ) - a higher dark matter density is then required to explain why these galaxies have circular velocities comparable to those of similarly luminous hsbs ( verehijen & de blok 1999 ) . hence lsb galaxies offer an ideal opportunity to study the distribution of dark matter and compare the observational results with current theories of structure formation .",
    "predictions of cold dark matter simulations were found to disagree with the rotation curves measured from hi emission in many dwarf galaxies and lsb galaxies ( moore 1994 ; flores & primack 1994 ) ) . observed galaxies would have halos with a constant density core whereas simulated halos have cuspy density profiles falling as @xmath1 ( the nfw model , navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) or even steeper ( moore et al .",
    "1999a ) . while some observers have pointed out several limitations of the original measurements of rotation curves based on hi emission from atomic hydrogen and have thus analyzed several of the same galaxies using stellar h@xmath2 line ( swaters et al .",
    "2000 ; van den bosch & swaters 2001 ; swaters 2003 ) , recent high resolution data obtained using both techniques seem to confirm that the majority of the rotation curves of lsb galaxies can not be fit by the cuspy halo profiles predicted by cdm cosmogonies ( de blok , mcgaugh & rubin 2001a , b;de blok et al .",
    "2001;de blok & bosma 2002 ) . in dwarf galaxies",
    "strong supernovae feedback might play a role in affecting the overall mass distribution ( navarro et al .",
    "1994 ) , but the quiescent star formation histories of lsb galaxies together with the fairly large potential wells of many of them rule out such a scenario ( bell et al . 1994 , 1999 ; bergman , jorgensen & hill 2002 ) .    recently weinberg & katz ( 2002 ) have suggested that the dark matter cusp might be erased thanks to the dynamical interaction with a stellar bar . it has been known for a while that a rotating barred potential would slow down due to dynamical friction against the halo background , shedding its angular momentum to the latter ( hernquist & weinberg 1994 ) . of course , the deceleration of the bar will be stronger in more massive halos .",
    "debattista & sellwood ( 1998 , 2000 ) where the first to note that the dynamical interaction between the bar and the halo could provide clues to the nature of the latter ; they noted that if galaxies have massive dark halos as predicted by cold dark matter models it would be hard to explain why bars in many galaxies are quite fast rotators .",
    "on the other end , valenzuela & klypin ( 2002 ) claim that the net transfer of angular momentum to the bars is quite weak - bars slow down on a quite long timescale even in cdm halos as angular momentum is exchanged back from the halo to the individual stellar orbits supporting them once a sufficiently high force resolution is used in the simulations .",
    "weinberg & katz ( 2002 ) consider the idealized case of a very massive non - responsive bar and find that the resonant transfer of energy and angular momentum from the bar to an nfw halo can actually change the density profile of the latter creating a constant density in only a few gyr .",
    "the effect would occur only when the resonant orbits in the halo are well resolved , which requires a very large number of particles in an n - body simulation , of order of a few millions .",
    "but sellwood ( 2002 ) , using a different numerical technique , finds the effect to be almost negligible for more realistic initial setups of the galaxies in which the bar is not imposed from the start and can evolve instead of being just a rigid potential .",
    "whereas further investigation of the effectiveness of the bar - halo interaction with self - consistent stellar bars is necessary , an even more basic question arises ; can this mechanism be at play in the most interesting case , namely that of lsb galaxies ?",
    "how likely is that these galaxies would go bar unstable ? indeed ,",
    "numerical studies on bar formation and bar - halo interactions have always employed models of high surface brightness galaxies .    while bars seem to be ubiquitous among spiral galaxies as a whole ( eskridge et al .",
    "2000 ) , low surface brightness galaxies are expected to be stable to bar formation due to a combination of low disk self - gravity and high dark matter contents ( mihos et al .",
    "but the current status of observations seems to suggest a quite complex scenario . in fact , while blue lsb disk galaxies are indeed typically non - barred ( although some dwarf lsbs have magellanic bars ) , red lsb galaxies comprise several systems showing distortions , evident bars and even bulge - like components ( bejersbergen et al . 1999 ) .",
    "tidal encounters might also trigger bar formation or other non - axisymmetric distortions even in lsbs ( mihos et al .",
    "1997 ) and might actually be required to destabilize the gas in the disks and sustain star formation ( schombert et al .",
    "2001 ; verde et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "in this paper we study the formation of bars in models of lsb galaxies comprising a stellar and/or gaseous disk embedded in a dark matter halo whose structure is motivated by the results of cdm models .",
    "such an approach is novel among studies of bar formation in galaxies , having been only partially adopted by valenzuela & klypin ( 2002 ) .",
    "we have carried out a large set of high resolution n - body / sph simulations using the parallel binary tree + sph code pkdgrav / gasoline ( stadel , 2001 ; stadel , richardson & wadsley 2002 ; wadsley , stadel & quinn , 2003 ) .",
    "weinberg & katz ( 2001 ) argue that , although present - day low surface brightness galaxies might be stable to bar formation , they could have undergone a bar instability in the past when they first assembled a cold , massive disk .",
    "although such a bar would have likely triggered a burst of star formation , this being difficult to reconcile with the many hints pointing towards a fairly smooth star formation history for these galaxies ( bergman , jorgensen & hill 2002 ) , observations still can not exclude that at least the redder among these galaxies might hide a faded massive disk ( oneil et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ) .",
    "the bulge - like components seen in many red lsbs might be the result of secular evolution of an old bar ( combes 1991 ; carollo et al 2001 ) . in brief , the origin and nature of lsb galaxies is still subject to debate and therefore we will consider a range of models covering a vast parameter space in terms of masses and internal structure of disks and halos .",
    "our only two constraints will be that the rotation curves of the models have to resemble those of observed lsbs , i.e. they have to be slowly rising out to several disk scale lengths ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) , and that disks have scale lengths bigger than those of hsbs having the same luminosity ( zwaan et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "models with a major gaseous disk can represent either lsbs during their early evolutionary stage or those numerous present - day lsb galaxies in which the baryonic mass is mostly contributed by the gas component .",
    "( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) .",
    "we note that the same disk model realized as purely gaseous instead of purely stellar is not expected to have the same stability properties ; it has been shown that fluid configurations tend to be more stable because pressure is generally isotropic while the corresponding stellar analog , the velocity dispersion , is generally anisotropic ( cazes & tohline 2000 ) .",
    "however , the study of the stability of purely gaseous disks embedded in dark matter halos is new to our knowledge ; works exist on the stability of generic axisymmetric or triaxial fluid configurations ( cazes & tohline 2000 , barnes & tohline 2001 ) and even on bar - unstable exponential gaseous galactic disks ( friedli & benz ( 1993 ; 1995 ) but all these studies did not include any realistic dark matter component in their models and are therefore extremely idealized when applied to the dynamical evolution of real galaxies .",
    "the stability of gaseous and stellar systems , both uniformly rotating and differentially rotating , was also studied by christodoulou et al .",
    "( 1995 ) - these authors tried to extend to gaseous disks within dark halos a criterion for stability against bar formation originally developed by efstathiou , lake & negroponte ( 1982 ) for stellar disks but did not test their conclusions with numerical simulations .",
    "finally , we will also consider the case of perturbations tidally induced by massive satellites , as expected during the hierarchical build - up of structures .",
    "strong tidal interactions with even more massive galaxies would also occur in a hierarchical scenario and surely will drive bar formation but they would also transmute these fragile disk galaxies into spheroidals or even destroy them ( moore et al .",
    "1999 ; mayer et al .",
    "2001a , b ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows ; in section 2 we describe the models and the initial setup of the simulations , in section 3 we illustrate the results of the simulations , section 4 contains the discussion and a summary follows in the last section .",
    "galaxy models are built as in mayer et al .",
    "( 2001b;2002 ) using the technique originally developed by hernquist ( 1993 ) ( see also springel & white 1999 ) .",
    "we use a system of units such that @xmath3 , @xmath4=6.5 \\times 10 ^ 9 m_{\\odot}$ ] and @xmath5=6 $ ] kpc .",
    "the models comprise a dark matter halo and an embedded stellar or gaseous disk ( or both ) .",
    "structural parameters were chosen in order to obtain slowly rising rotation curves resembling those published for lsb galaxies ( e.g. de blok et al .",
    "2001a , b , de blok , mcgaugh & rubin 2001 , de blok & bosma 2002 , van den bosch & swaters 2001 ) .",
    "we start by choosing the value of the circular velocity of the halo at the virial radius , @xmath6 , which , for an assumed cosmology ( hereafter @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 kms@xmath10mpc@xmath10 ) automatically determines the virial mass , @xmath11 , and virial radius , @xmath12 , of the halo ( mo , mao & white 1998 ) .",
    "we choose @xmath13 km / s .",
    "halos have nfw density profiles ( navarro , frenk & white 1995 , 1997 ) with different halo concentrations,@xmath14 , and spin parameters , @xmath15 ( mo , mao & white 1998 ) . the concentration is defined as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the halo scale radius ; the spin parameter is defined as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are , respectively , the total angular momentum and total energy of the halo and @xmath21 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the value of the concentration @xmath14 basically defines what fraction of the total mass of the halo is contained within its inner regions , where the baryonic disk lies ; the concentration increases with decreasing mass and , for a given mass , has a scatter of roughly a factor of 2 , mainly due to different formation epochs ( bullock et al .",
    "2001 ; eke , navarro & steinmetz 2001 ) .",
    "the average concentration for galaxies with @xmath22 75 km / s is @xmath23 in the standard lcdm model assumed here .",
    "however fitting rotation curves of lsbs with nfw profiles often requires @xmath24 ( van den bosch & swaters 2001 ; de blok & bosma 2002 ) , at the lower end of the allowed range of values .",
    "we consider three values for the halo concentration , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    placing galaxy disks inside cosmological halos would in principle require to have first solved the problem of galaxy formation in the lcdm scenario . incidentally , whereas for years simulations of galaxy formation within cdm models have been plagued by the so - called angular momentum `` catastrophe '' ( navarro & steinmetz 2000 ) , producing only tiny disks an order of magnitude smaller than those of real galaxies , new sph simulations with considerably higher resolution and an improved treatment of gasdynamics find this problem to be significantly alleviated ( governato et al .",
    "2002 , see also sommer - larsen et al .",
    "2002 ; thacker & couchman 2001 ) .",
    "these new simulations produce disks bearing scaling relations with their dark matter halos reasonably close to the predictions of the semi - analytical models by mo , mao & white ( 1998 ) - the latter are able to match the properties of spiral galaxies assuming angular momentum conservation of the baryons as they cool into the halos and settle into a centrifugally supported disk(fall & efstathiou 1980 ) .",
    "we thus construct models of lsb galaxies that follow the scaling relations of mo , mao & white ( 1998 ) .",
    "the procedure used to assign structural parameters is described in detail in mayer et al .",
    "( 2001b ) and mayer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . here",
    "we recall that we use exponential disks ( with a few exceptions indicated below ) and that their mass and scale length are determined primarily by @xmath11 and @xmath15 and , to a minor extent , by the disk / halo mass ratio , @xmath28 , and halo concentration @xmath14 ( the latter two parameters contribute to specify the potential energy of the system and thus the rotational energy needed for centrifugal support ) .",
    "the adiabatic contraction of the halo in response to the accumulation of baryons at the center is also taken into account ( springel & white 1999 ) . as we mentioned in section 1 ,",
    "rotation curves of lsb disk galaxies suggest that these systems are extremely dark matter dominated , with stellar disk / halo ratios @xmath29 or less , namely at least a factor of 2 lower than those of hsbs of comparable luminosity ( oneil et al .",
    "2001 , chung et al .",
    "however , this difference probably reflects the fact that in lsbs a larger fraction of the baryons , sometimes most of them , are found in the gaseous component ; indeed the total disk mass ( stars + gas ) relative to the halo mass is quite similar in lsbs and hsbs ( mcgaugh et al . 2000 ) .",
    "previous works on the detailed mass modeling of lsb galaxies have indeed found a typical value of @xmath30 for the total disk / halo mass ratio in these systems ( hernandez & gilmore 1998 ) .",
    "we thus adopt the view that lsbs are simply more extended than hsbs because of larger halo spin parameters and eventually lower halo concentration , as originally suggested by dalcanton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and mo , mao & white ( 1998 ) , ( see also jimenez et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and hernandez & gilmore ( 1998 ) ) and as confirmed more recently by jimenez , verde & oh ( 2003 ) in their modeling of h@xmath2 rotation curves .",
    "the disk mass fraction @xmath28 is usually set equal to @xmath31 or less in our models but we also consider cases in which @xmath32 , such a massive disk being expected in scenarios where lsbs have a massive faded stellar component ( oneil et al .",
    "2001;chung et al . 2002 ; galaz et al .",
    "the highest value of @xmath28 is still consistent with the upper limit set for @xmath33 by nucleosynthesis , @xmath34 ( fukugita , hogan & peebles 1999 ) ; in this case , however , we are implicitly assuming that nearly all the baryons ended up in the disk ( it is somewhat an extreme assumption - see verde et al .",
    "jimenez et al . ( 1998 ) , who coupled a stellar population synthesis model to a simple galaxy formation scheme in the context of the hierarchical clustering , find that @xmath35 is required to match the surface brightness and colors of several `` blue '' lsbs . in our models , halos have spin parameters either @xmath30 or @xmath36 , larger than the mean value found in cosmological simulations , @xmath37 ( e.g. gardner 2001 , lemson & kaufmann 1998 ) - these values yield a disk scale length , @xmath38 , in the range 2 - 6 kpc , consistent with observations ( e.g. zwaan et al .",
    "1995 , oneil et al .",
    "although our halos have @xmath39 km / s , the different halo concentrations and the addition of the stellar disk produce a peak rotational velocity , @xmath40 ( at @xmath41 ) between @xmath42 and @xmath43 km / s , within the range of the maximum rotation speeds measured for the majority of lsbs in the samples by de blok & mcgaugh ( 1997 ) and by de blok & bosma ( 2002 ) .",

    "we recall that the general expectation is that lsb galaxies should be quite stable to non - axisymmetric instabilities ; in this context the assumption of an isothermal equation of state will provide the most favorable condition for the formation and survival of bars in gaseous disks by forcing the disk to remain cold ( for instance it might underestimate heating when a disk has already entered a phase of strong instability ) - in reality the same systems can only be more stable if they retain some of the heat generated during their dynamical evolution .",

    "the thermal energy is constant over time and so no thermal energy equation is required ( any heating resulting from the artificial viscosity term , which is still present in the momentum equation , is radiated away ) , in the adiabatic case the thermal energy can rise as a result of compressional and shock heating and can drop following decompressions .",

    "the only other existing work in which n - body simulations of bar formation with similarly high resolution were performed is valenzuela & klypin ( 2002 ) ; compared to them we use a lower force resolution , i.e we employ a ( spline ) softening corresponding to @xmath80 ( for both the stars and the gas ) while they use @xmath81 .",
    "however , a small softening is not necessarily a good choice - force resolution must be balanced with mass resolution in order to avoid increasing the noise due to the discrete representation of the systems ( hernquist , hut & makino 1993;moore , katz & lake 1996 ) and our conservative choice has been widely tested in this respect ( mayer et al .",

    "this slight discrepancy is likely due to the much lower resolution used in the n - body simulations of those authors ( more than an order of magnitude less particles than even the lowest resolution simulations presented here ) which was likely enhancing bar formation .",
    "the fact that @xmath66 does not account for several dynamical aspects of bar formation , like the stabilizing effect of a large velocity dispersion of the disk and the possible interruption of swing amplification by the lindblad barriers , and yet it provides a good fit to our results , strengthens our interpretation that the halo / disk mass ratio within the typical disk radius , which is related to both halo concentration and disk mass fraction ( see rotation curves in figures 1 and 2 ) is really determining the behavior of our galaxy models ( had we included models with `` hard centers '' produced by .",

    "we find these conclusions to hold regardless of whether the orbit of the satellite is nearly circular or nearly radial . on a very eccentric orbit",
    "the impulsive heating at pericenter drives the formation of outer spiral arms in the disk .",
    "therefore , the perturbing satellite does not appear to trigger the bar instability in the disks : this is in contrast to what observed when an lsb satellite interacts with a much more massive galaxy halo ( mayer et al .",
    "2001a , b ) , suggesting that only extremely strong perturbations can stimulate the growth of bar modes in these low surface density disks .    in conclusion",
    "there seems to be only a small region of the parameter space possibly covered by lsb galaxies where the formation of a stellar bar is possible within a cuspy halo .",
    "in particular , these disks are stable within nfw halos as concentrated as typically expected in lcdm ( @xmath105 ) . in order to grow bars ,",
    "models need a baryonic fraction as high as 10 % of the total mass for a spin parameter @xmath106 . this is more than a factor of 2 higher than the baryon fraction estimated for most observed lsb galaxies ( ( hernandez et al .",
    "1998 ) and is higher by an even larger amount compared to the fraction of baryons estimated to be in stars for a normal stellar mass - to - light ratio ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) .",
    "of course one could imagine that current surveys are still missing a fraction of the baryons of lsbs because these galaxies are very extended and/or have a significant old stellar population not detectable in the optical ( oneil et al .",
    "2000 ; galaz et al .",
    "2002 ) ; even so the required baryon content is quite high , being close to @xmath107 , the upper limit indicated by nucleosynthesis ( fukugita , hogan & peebles 1999 - but note that the new wmap data allow for a sensibly higher upper limit , @xmath108 ( spergel et al .",
    "hence the models with massive disks are somewhat extreme as they demand that nearly all of the baryons available to the galaxy have already cooled into the disk . as mentioned in section 2 ,",
    "if @xmath59 model lmd2c12 g has a central surface brightness high enough to be close to the upper limit usually adopted as a definition of an lsb galaxy in surveys , @xmath109 mag arcsec@xmath61 , while it would be a more typical lsb when placed in a low concentration halo ( ( @xmath110 mag arcsec@xmath61 ) ; this is because in our modeling more concentrated halos naturally produce more compact disks ( mo , mao & white 1998 ) .",
    "one option to bring down the initial surface density / brightness ( keeping @xmath6 and @xmath28 fixed ) is to start from a larger value of the spin parameter , which would reduce the disk surface density by spreading the same disk mass over a larger radius . to explore the latter hypothesis we evolved a galaxy with @xmath111 and @xmath27 ( model lmd2c12b , see table 1 ) that would have a lower central surface brightness ( @xmath112 mag arcsec@xmath113 ) , near the average for lsbs .",
    "such a model still goes bar unstable after @xmath114 gyr .",
    "hence there is some flexibility in the choice of the disk surface density that can lead to bar formation , even for a highly concentrated halo , but always provided that the disk is sufficiently massive .      the simulations employing an exponential gaseous disks with @xmath100 and an isothermal equation of state show results that are sensibly different from those of the corresponding collisionless runs .",
    "a distinct bar forms within a @xmath25 halo ( lmd1c4 g , see figure 7 ) after 5 gyr , while only a short - lived bar - like distortion was observed in the corresponding collisionless run and only for the lowest initial value of @xmath49 ( model lmd1c4q3 , see table 1 ) .",
    "only milder non - axisymmetric patterns , either spiral - like or oval , appear after a few gyr in halos having @xmath27 ( lmd1c12 g ) . later these patterns evolve into clump - like structures near the peaks of the surface density distortions .",
    "we note that the bar which forms in the lmd1c4 g is visibly shorter than that produced in any of the stellar - dynamical models ( its radius is @xmath115 ) and it also appears much later ; we intend to explore in detail the formation path of this type of gaseous bar in a forthcoming paper .",
    "once formed , the bar quickly evolves ( in 1 - 2 gyr , of order of its rotation period ) into something resembling an oval distortion and then a bulge - like component ( figure 8) .",
    "it is thus a really short - lived feature during the evolution of the gaseous disk .",
    "rising the initial disk temperature by about @xmath116 ( model lmd1c4 gb in table 1 ) is enough to prevent the growth of the bar .",
    "nonetheless , this simulation suggests that cold gaseous disks appear more prone to undergo non - axisymmetric instabilities with respect to their stellar analog ( see also figure 5 on the ellipticity ) .",
    "the reason is that the temperature is constant with time for model lmd1c4 g while its stellar dynamical analog , the velocity dispersion , is not constant in the corresponding collisionless models ( e.g. lmd1c4 ) , instead it actually increases with time , driving @xmath49 towards large values . for example , after 4 gyr ( just before the bar appears in model lmd1c4 g ) the average velocity dispersion of model lmd1c4 has increased by a factor 2.5 within the disk scale length in response to weak spiral instabilities , and @xmath117 results throughout the disk , too high for the bar to develop .",
    "we tested whether the gaseous disk would respond in a similar way if cooling was inefficient ; we thus evolved the same disk adiabatically for 6 gyr and we found that , as expected , the bar does not form in this case .",
    "in fact , after 4 gyr , the temperature has grown by more than a factor of 5 in the inner few kpcs ( reaching 35000 k ) , which raises @xmath49 by a about a factor of 2 ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "the disk now looks even smoother than the stellar disk , i.e. even less non - axisymmetric structure is present ( compare figure 7 and figure 3 ) .",
    "however , the isothermal calculations are probably more realistic at least in a global sense as cooling should be efficient enough to keep the temperature of the hi disk below @xmath119 k ( martin & kennicutt 2001 - see also section 2 ) .",
    "therefore , we tend to conclude that in reality gaseous disks should be more susceptible to grow bars compared to stellar disks , although this does not imply anything on the relative longevity of the two types of bars ( see below ) .",
    "the disk evolution is also dependent on the type of the gas profile . in models where the gaseous disk has a constant gas - density profile ( and",
    "is evolved isothermally ) a strong bar does not appear neither in low nor in highly concentrated halos .",
    "in these models the surface density of the gaseous disk is too low everywhere ( see the rotation curves in figure 2 and the values of the stability parameters in table 1 ) and therefore it is not surprising that the growth of bar modes is suppressed .",

    "the bar persists for several gyr , although it weakens as time goes on ( the elongation of the density distribution diminishes , see last snapshot of figure 10 ) , maybe because of the growing central mass concentration ( hasan & norman 1990 ; friedli & benz 1993 ; norman , sellwood & hasan 1996 ) .",

    "in addition , these low star formation rates imply a weak supernovae feedback with little impact on the thermal and dynamical evolution of the gas , this being consistent with our assumption of an isothermal evolution . of course , when significant non - axisymmetric structure , bars or clump - like features form all these assumptions could break locally as the surface density grows above some threshold . in the light disk models ( @xmath100 ) the surface density increases , on average , by only a factor 2 in the bar region ( in the inner few kpcs in figure 14 ) . instead , in models with heavy disks the average surface density within 1 - 2 scale lengths increases by a factor of 10 and would result in a typical star formation rate of @xmath127yr , comparable to that of actively star forming hsb galaxies ( bell et al .",

    "a similar evolutionary scenario has been recently proposed by noguchi ( 2002 ) to explain giant lsb galaxies which bear a resemblance to the red lsbs but have a much larger size , bigger @xmath139 ratios and even redder colors ( sprayberry et al .",
    "however , while noguchi starts from a model of a normal hsb galaxy ( without gas ) here we have shown that even galaxies that start with fairly low surface density disks can become bar unstable and form a bulge provided that their disk is sufficiently massive with respect to the halo .",
    "the bulges that form in our models have both profiles and scale lengths that match those of the red , early - type lsb galaxies in beijersbergen et al . ( 1999 ) . ; they are fit by exponential laws and their scale lengths are typically @xmath145 ( figure 13 , 14 , and 15 ) .",
    "when translated into physical sizes , bulge scale lengths are as large as 0.4 - 0.9 kpc , i.e significantly larger than the bulges of `` normal '' hsb galaxies of similar luminosity ( de jong & van der kruit 1994 ) . being the product of secular disk evolution , the bulge scale lengths are correlated with those of the surrounding lsb disks , matching another feature of the galaxies in beijersbergen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ( for hsb galaxies a similar correlation is indeed found , see de jong & van der kruit 1995 and macarthur , courteau & holtzman 2003 ) .",
    "also , as already mentioned in section 3.3 , disks remain exponential but increase their scale length by at least a factor of 2 , reaching as much as 9 kpc ( e.g. figure 13 ) .",
    "red early - type lsbs also have disks with huge scale lengths , bigger than their blue counterparts for the same luminosity",
    ". some of the red lsbs also exhibit significant spiral structure ; this appears to be triggered by the bar in our simulations and persists even after this has turned into a bulge , especially for purely gaseous disks ( figure 7 and 10 ) .    in our scenario bulges",
    "form after a ( gaseous ) disk has already settled into the halo as a result of secular bar evolution .",
    "the bulge would be a younger than the disk in a dynamical sense but after a few gyr it would look redder than the latter due to the different mean age of its stars ; indeed , as we showed above , the different density structure of the two components suggests that , while an early burst of star formation is plausible for the bulge , the disk would undergo a weaker but more prolonged star formation .",
    "in particular , the spiral arms might excited by the central bar would play an important role in the star formation history of the disk .",
    "bars and rings are actually present in some of the red lsbs , in which case they also have bluer colors in their central part ; these systems resemble the intermediate stages seen in our simulations , while systems with distinct bulges are likely in the late evolutionary stage , and indeed they also look redder in the center as if the stellar population there has already undergone significant fading .",
    "future detailed observations of color and age gradients throughout the disk and the bulge should enable to better judge how realistic is the scenario proposed here .",
    "simulations including star formation and explicit cooling and heating are better suited to explore further this issue and will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .    how large a population of lsb galaxies with bars / bulges should we expect based on our model ?",
    "the naive expectation is that such galaxies should be rare as they originate from systems with disk mass fractions close to the upper limit for the baryon fraction ( jaffe et al .",
    "on the other end , several authors , by modeling galaxy rotation curves , find a positive correlation between the spin parameter and the disk mass fraction ( e.g. burkert ( 2000 ) , van den bosch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , jimenez , verde & oh ( 2003)),which would imply that massive disks are more common among lsb galaxies .",
    "this correlation is not well understood .",
    "burkert ( 2000 ) has proposed that it might result from a correlation between disk specific angular momentum ( which might be different from that of the parent dark matter halo ) and the disk mass fraction - however at the moment it can not be excluded that the correlation is produced by systematic errors in the procedure used to determine the dark halo parameters , especially when the rotation curves do not extend far enough in radius ( verde et al .",
    "2002 ) . nonetheless , the recent analysys of 400 rotation curves reported in jimenez et al .",
    "( 2003 ) indicates that more than @xmath146 of high spin systems ( i.e. with @xmath147 , the minimum value considered in this paper ) have disk mass fractions near @xmath36 ( l. verde , private communication ) .",
    "these results leave open the interesting possibility that many lsb galaxies are massive enough to become bar unstable and undergo the morphological transformation described in this paper .",
    "= 8truecm    .    relating the final state of bar unstable but light ( @xmath87 ) gaseous disks to known galaxies turns out to be less obvious .",
    "the bulge - like component that appears late in these systems would have an unusually low optical surface brightness as it forms out of gas having very low surface densities ; assuming @xmath148 , as typical of old spheroid stellar populations , these bulges would have a b band surface brightness @xmath149 mag arcsec@xmath61 .",
    "such a low surface brightness is significantly lower than any of those of the objects studied in beijersbergen et al .",
    "however , although the bulge will be fainter than the disk and might be hardly recognizable in optical bands , it should still stand out when observed with longer wavelengths because of its intrinsically higher stellar density ( see figure 14 ) .",
    "many blue lsb galaxies or lsb dwarfs do not have significant spiral / non - axisymmetric structure , appearing rather amorphous or irregular ( de blok , van der hulst & bothun 1995 ) ; on the basis of our results , the simplest interpretation of these systems is that they are stable because they have fairly light disks , @xmath150 and/or halos as highly concentrated as expected in a lcdm model .",
    "most of the galaxies whose measured rotation curves are nourishing the debate on dark matter cores would fall into the latter category ; therefore one would be tempted to conclude that bars can not occur in these systems and hence can not be invoked to explain the present - day structure of their inner halo .",
    "however , we can not exclude that the available observations lack sufficient resolution and are still hiding some important clues to the past dynamical histories of these objects ( see de blok , walter & bell 1999 ) .",
    "new high - resolution observations of individual blue lsb galaxies at long wavelengths will show whether dim , red bulges are present in galaxies previously classified as blue , late - type lsbs and hence whether bar formation could have taken place in the past .",
    "only if such spheroidal components will turn out to be extremely rare we will conclude that bar formation , and thus bar / halo interactions , can be neglected for these galaxies .",
    "interestingly , the recent observations in j and k bands by galaz et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggest that at least a fraction of the systems that appear featureless in the optical hide a central red bulge or nucleus when observed in the near - ir .",
    "of course , high - resolution images might also reveal bar - like distortions . indeed",
    ", some bars are observed in a few lsb galaxies included in a recent sample used by swaters et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to measure h@xmath2 rotation curves ; these authors claim that the barred systems have slightly shallower halo inner slopes compared to the non - barred ones , although they admit that non - circular motions due to the bars themselves make the determination of the actual rotational velocity very hard and questionable in these cases .",
    "however , even though evidence of present or past bars will be found in a number of lsb galaxies , our simulations do not provide strong support for a scenario in which bars can significantly affect the structure of the dark halo .",
    "in fact , the bars arising in our simulated galaxies are rather short , from 3 to 8 times smaller than the halo scale radius , @xmath17 ( see section 2 ) , hence typically shorter than the long massive bars assumed in weinberg & katz ( 2002 ) ( but note that the bar in model lmd2c12b , which is the longest due to the large value of the spin parameter , approaches the size of the bar considered in that paper ) ; recent calculations by sellwood ( 2002 ) show that , no matter how effective is the transfer of angular momentum between the bar and the halo , bars up to 4 times smaller than @xmath17 do not store enough angular momentum to produce the observed large dark matter cores .",
    "a particularly short bar arises in light disks ( model lmd1c4 g ) , its size being @xmath151 times smaller than @xmath17 , hence smaller than any of the bars studied by sellwood ( 2002 ) .",
    "finally , the fact that all the bars in our simulations , and especially the gaseous ones , seem to undergo a fast morphological evolution , also goes in the direction of a modest dynamical impact on the dark halo .",
    "in this paper we have shown that bar formation in lsb galaxies is possible , yet the initial conditions required for this to happen apply to only a narrow region of the parameter space made available by currently favored hierarchical models of structure formation . in addition , the characteristics of the bars that eventually form in such systems as well as their rapid morphological evolution hardly support the idea that bar - halo interactions play a crucial role in shaping the inner structure of the dark matter halo .",
    "our main findings are summarized as follows ;    * the halo / disk mass ratio within the region where the disk lies determines whether the studied lsb models are stable or not .",
    "this ratio is fixed once both the halo concentration and the disk mass are fixed and sets the degree of swing amplification of @xmath94 modes .",
    "in particular , lsb galaxies with disks as massive as 10% of the halo mass can become bar unstable for quite a range of concentration values .",
    "* lsb galaxies with ( typical ) light disks ( @xmath87 ) can become bar unstable if their halo concentration is as low as @xmath25 and their disks are essentially gaseous and cold .",
    "such low concentrations are rare among lcdm halos .",
    "* bars forming in lsb galaxies are usually much shorter than the halo scale radius - they are not expected to contain enough angular momentum to turn the inner cusp of dark matter halos into a core .",
    "* both gaseous and stellar bars evolve into central bulge - like structures after a few gyr .",
    "the bar and the bulge have surface densities up to 2 order of magnitudes higher than the surrounding low surface density disks .",
    "radically different star formation histories are thus expected in the central part of the galaxy as opposed to the extended disk . *",
    "the structural properties of the final states ( after up to 10 gyr of evolution ) of bar unstable , massive lsb disks are consistent with those of the red , early - type lsb galaxies observed by beijersbergen et al .",
    "our secular evolution scenario naturally explains observed correlations like that between the disk and bulge scale lengths . *",
    "blue lsb galaxies included in samples used to measure rotation curves usually appear featureless in the optical ; our findings imply that that a dim , red bulge - like component must be present at their center if they ever formed a bar .",
    "future observations of these galaxies in the near infrared should reveal whether these hidden bulges exist in most lsbs ; first attempts in this direction ( galaz et al .",
    "2002 ) suggest that this might be the case .",
    "l.m . is grateful to victor debattista for carefully reading an early version of the paper and for providing plenty of useful comments and suggestions .",
    "we also thank james schombert , martin weinberg , neal katz and thomas quinn for interesting and stimulating discussions on lsb galaxies and on the dynamics of barred galaxies , and marcella carollo , julianne dalcanton and licia verde for helpful information on recent observations .",
