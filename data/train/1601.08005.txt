    "the experiments are performed using a sample of ultracold @xmath1cs atoms , released from a far - off - resonant optical dipole trap ( odt ) inside an ultrahigh - vacuum chamber .",
    "the small size of typically @xmath12  @xmath13 m full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the sample in the odt reduces the influence of electric - field gradients on the measured transition frequencies .",
    "typical samples contain @xmath14 atoms and have a translational temperature of 70  @xmath13k and a peak density of @xmath15  @xmath16 .",
    "details of the experimental setup can be found in ref .",
    "we describe here only the aspects relevant for the measurements presented in this article .",
    "the electric field is controlled by a set of eight electrodes in the vacuum chamber , which allows for independent adjustment of the field in all three spatial directions .",
    "stray electric fields are canceled by using a procedure based on the measurement of the quadratic stark effect of @xmath17 rydberg states  @xcite .",
    "the procedure is repeated regularly ( at least daily ) to ensure that residual electric fields never exceed 1  mv / cm .",
    "similarly , stray magnetic fields are measured by radio - frequency ( rf ) recordings of the @xmath18 transition in the @xmath19 ground state of cs and are reduced to below 2  mg by three external pairs of coils  @xcite .",
    "the atoms in the odt are first prepared in the upper hyperfine component of the 6s@xmath0 ground state ( @xmath20 ) by spatially - selective optical pumping .",
    "they are then excited in a single - photon transition to @xmath2p@xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) rydberg states .",
    "a cooper minimum in the photoexcitation cross section from the 6s@xmath0 ground state of cs to the @xmath2p@xmath0 rydberg states just above the ionization threshold leads to a strong reduction of the absorption cross section for these states at high values of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "we increase the power and the pulse length of the excitation laser to compensate for this effect .    for @xmath23 ,",
    "the rydberg atoms are detected by switching the electric potential at an additional electrode to a high value , which field ionizes the rydberg atoms and accelerates the resulting ions toward a micro - channel - plate detector  @xcite .",
    "the detector signal is recorded with a digital - storage oscilloscope .",
    "the digitized trace is transferred to a computer and is analyzed by a peak - finding algorithm to determine the number of detected ions . at values of @xmath2 lower than 42 , field - ionization is not efficient in the same configuration of applied electric potentials .",
    "we therefore introduce a delay of 100  @xmath13s between excitation and the application of the pulsed potential . during this delay",
    ", rydberg atoms can spontaneously ionize and the resulting ions are then extracted and detected as described above .",
    "possible ionization mechanisms include direct ionization by black - body radiation or black - body - radiation - enhanced field ionization  @xcite , interaction - induced penning - ionization of pairs of rydberg atoms  @xcite , and collisions between rydberg atoms and hot atoms from the background gas in the chamber .    a ring dye laser system ( coherent 899 - 21 ) , pumped by a frequency - doubled continuous - wave nd : yvo@xmath24 laser ( quantum finesse 532 ) , and a frequency - doubling unit ( coherent mbd 200 ) are used to produce frequency - tunable light for the excitation into rydberg states at wavelengths around 319  nm .",
    "the frequency of the ring dye laser is stabilized using a two - step locking scheme .",
    "first , the frequency is stabilized to an external reference cavity ( thorlabs sa200 - 5b ) .",
    "one of the cavity mirrors is mounted onto a piezoelectrical actuator which allows for tuning of the resonance frequency of the cavity .",
    "the error signal for the stabilization is derived using the pound - drever - hall technique  @xcite by modulating only a small part of the fundamental output of the ring laser with an electro - optical modulator .",
    "an analog proportional - integral ( pi ) controller feeds the error signal back to the electronic control box of the ring laser , which was modified according to ref .",
    "the closed - loop bandwidth of this lock is @xmath258  khz .",
    "second , slow drifts of the length of the reference cavity are observed by measuring the laser frequency with a wave meter ( highfinesse ws-7 ) .",
    "the measured frequency is stabilized to a chosen set point by applying a variable voltage to the piezoelectrical actuator of the reference cavity .",
    "the closed - loop bandwidth of this lock is @xmath2510  hz . the frequency of the laser is scanned in steps of typically 150  khz by varying the lock set point . while the absolute accuracy of the wave meter is specified as 60  mhz ( @xmath26 ) , the intrinsic allan deviation of the wave meter measurements is typically around 300  khz over periods shorter than one minute  @xcite , which was confirmed by own measurements .",
    "the absolute frequency of the excitation laser radiation is determined by overlapping a small part of the fundamental beam at @xmath25640  nm with light from a frequency comb ( menlo systems fc1500 - 250-wg ) on a fast photodiode and counting the frequency of the resulting beat note .",
    "the absolute accuracy of the wave meter is sufficient to unambiguously determine the mode number of the beating comb tooth .",
    "all frequencies reported in this article were obtained by direct comparison with the frequency of a rb oscillator ( stanford research systems fs725 ) having a stability of @xmath27 over a typical measurement time of 10  s and being disciplined by a gps receiver ( spectrum instruments tm-4 ) with a specified long - term stability of @xmath28 .",
    "the accuracy of this clock yields directly the accuracy of the optical frequency measurements  @xcite .",
    "the continuous uv light is chopped into short pulses of 3 to 20  @xmath13s length using the negative first diffraction order of an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) in single - pass configuration .",
    "the rf signal driving the aom is derived from a stable quartz oscillator at 110.000(1 ) mhz .",
    "its frequency was repeatedly controlled by recording and analyzing rf - leakage signals with an antenna and a fast - fourier transformation on a digital oscilloscope ( lecroy waverunner 604zi , specified clock accuracy at time of measurement : 4  ppm ) .",
    "the experimentally observed line widths are on the order of 1.2  mhz ( fwhm ) .",
    "possible contributions to the widths are the spontaneous decay of the rydberg states , the doppler broadening of the transitions , inhomogeneous broadening caused by residual electric fields , broadenings induced by rydberg - rydberg - interactions , the hyperfine splitting of the rydberg states , and the bandwidth of the excitation radiation .",
    "the natural line widths of transitions to @xmath29 rydberg states scale with the principal quantum number @xmath2 approximately as @xmath30 and are less than 10  khz for @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "their contributions to the experimental line widths are thus negligible .",
    "the motion of the atoms resulting from the finite temperature of the sample causes a homogeneous doppler broadening of the transitions in the ultraviolet with an estimated fwhm of 600  khz .",

    "the same holds for inhomogeneous broadenings by van der waals interactions between rydberg atoms , which scale as @xmath36  @xcite and with the rydberg - atom density @xmath37 as @xmath38 . after reducing the number of excited rydberg atoms per shot to below 10 atoms",
    ", we observe an almost constant line width in the range @xmath39 .",
    "a significant contribution from these two mechanisms to the observed line width can thus be excluded .",
    "the hyperfine interaction is a fermi - contact - type interaction and the coupling strength scales as @xmath30 . in the case of cs , the nuclear spin ( @xmath40 ) and the magnetic - dipole hyperfine coupling constants are large ( e.g. , @xmath41 ghz )  @xcite , leading , at our resolution , to significant hyperfine splittings even for high rydberg states  @xcite . using experimentally determined hyperfine splittings for selected @xmath42 states from ref .",

    "we have presented an experiment with which the lowest ionization energy of @xmath1cs was determined to be @xmath5{cm^{-1}}$ ] with a relative uncertainty of @xmath68 .",
    "the uncertainty is two orders of magnitude smaller than the best previous result  @xcite and is limited by experimental sources of error and to a lesser extent by correlations of the parameters in the quantum - defect model of the rydberg - atom term values and the ionization energy .",
    "the experimental uncertainties , especially those resulting from the laser bandwidth and from the determination of the residual ac stark shifts of the atoms in the odt , might be reduced by a factor of at least three by using a uv laser with a narrower bandwidth than the laser available for the present investigation , and by performing the experiment with a small sample of atoms in a completely field - free environment .",
    "the correlations of the parameters in the global fit might be reduced by increasing the number of fitted rydberg series to include , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath2s@xmath0 and @xmath2d@xmath69 , for which unfortunately no data of comparable precision is available .",
    "our analysis also resulted in improved energy - dependent quantum defects for the @xmath2s@xmath0 , @xmath2p@xmath0 , @xmath2p@xmath3 , and @xmath2d@xmath7 series of cs .    with the present results ,",
    "we demonstrate that ionization energies can be determined with a precision of @xmath70  @xmath65 ( 42  khz ) by combining ( ultra)cold atoms , frequency - comb - based calibration and rydberg - series extrapolation . given the improvement margins of the experiment , a precision on the order of 10  khz seems possible in the near future .",
    "cs presents distinct advantages for a precise measurement of ionization energies .",
    "it can be easily laser cooled to sub - mk temperatures ; its first ionization threshold is reachable from the ground state with a single uv photon ; its large mass reduces the doppler broadening , and the closed - shell nature of the cs@xmath71 ion core facilitates the rydberg - series extrapolation .",
    "it was therefore an ideal system to test the precision limits of the experiment .",
    "unfortunately , cs possesses too many electrons for being an attractive system for accurate _ ab - initio _ quantum - chemical calculations in the near future .    on the basis of the results presented in this article we anticipate that new methods of generating cold samples of few - electron molecules  @xcite and advances towards extending frequency combs to the far - uv range of the electromagnetic spectrum  @xcite will soon permit measurements of few - electron molecules with a similar accuracy .",
    "the most accurate determination of the ionization energy in a molecular system , h@xmath72 , has an uncertainty of 12  mhz  @xcite and has stimulated advances in the _ ab - initio _ calculations of molecular energies including adiabatic , nonadiabatic , relativistic and quantum - electrodynamics corrections  @xcite .",
    "such calculations can now reach an accuracy comparable to that of the experiments . the uncertainty in the electron - proton mass ratio ( currently @xmath73 , _",
    "i.e. _ , a fractional uncertainty of @xmath74  @xcite ) imposes a fundamental limit of a few khz to the accuracy of theoretical determinations of the ionization energy of h@xmath72  @xcite .",
