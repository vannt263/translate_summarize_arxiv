    "the spatial distribution of galaxies , _ large scale structure _ ( lss ) , provides fundamental knowledge about the formation and evolution of the density structure in our universe .",
    "a recent measurement of the cmb ( cosmological microwave background ) anisotropy by wmap ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) puts a stringent constraint on the primordial density fluctuations , and favors the @xmath2-dominated spatially flat cold dark matter ( lcdm ) model with a gaussian initial condition @xcite .",
    "one of the goals in the analysis of galaxy distribution is to test cosmological models in an independent and complementary manner to the cmb analysis .",
    "another goal is to understand galaxy clustering , with particular emphasis on galaxy biasing , which is a statistical relation of the clustering between galaxies and the underlying dark matter .",
    "recent wide - field galaxy surveys , such as sdss ( sloan digital sky survey ) and 2dfgrs ( two degree field galaxy redshift survey ) , indeed enable a detailed study of galaxy clustering with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "more conventional statistics for analyzing the galaxy distribution is the two - point correlation function , or the power spectrum in fourier space .",
    "two - point statistics have been extensively studied for more than 35 years since the pioneer work by @xcite , and have been applied to various redshift surveys , including sdss ( e.g. , @xcite for sdss galaxies ; @xcite for sdss quasars ) .",
    "they , however , can not fully describe the statistical nature of the galaxy distribution , because lss is highly non - gaussian due to the nonlinear gravitational evolution and nonlinearity in the galaxy biasing . to characterize the non - gaussian properties of the galaxy distribution",
    "requires higher order statistics beyond two - point statistics .",
    "motivated by this requirement , various statistics have been introduced as complementary tools to two - point statistics for the analysis of galaxy clustering : higher order correlation functions ( e.g. , peebles 1980 ) , genus statistics @xcite , minkowski functionals @xcite , minimum spanning trees @xcite , void statistics @xcite , and so on . while these statistics capture different parts of non - gaussian features , they are not completely independent of the two - point statistics .",
    "the fourier transform , @xmath10 , of a density fluctuation field is separately written in terms of the amplitude and the phase , @xmath11 , as @xmath12 the gaussian fields have a uniform distribution of the fourier phases over @xmath13 . therefore , characterizing the correlation of phases is expected to be a direct means to explore the non - gaussian features .",
    "furthermore , fourier phases are statistically independent information of the power spectrum , which is defined by @xmath14 .",
    "nevertheless , finding useful statistics of the fourier phases is not easy , mainly because of the cyclic property of the phase .",
    "for example , the one - point phase distribution turns out to be essentially uniform , even in a strongly non - gaussian field @xcite .",
    "for this reason , previous studies of the fourier phase have been mainly devoted to the evolution of phase shifts in individual modes @xcite , or the phase differences between the fourier modes @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently proposed , as a new measure of phase correlations , the distribution function of the `` phase sum '' , @xmath15 , where the corresponding wavevectors satisfy @xmath16 .",
    "although a connection between the higher order statistics and the phase correlations was suggested earlier @xcite , he discovered an important analytic relation between the distribution function of the phase sum and the polyspectra using perturbation theory .",
    "a subsequent numerical analysis by @xcite explained the behavior of the phase - sum distribution with respect to the density structure in real space . when a prominent density peak exists in a given sampling volume , the fourier phases of various modes are synchronized to have nearly zero values at the position of peak , and thus the phase sum distributes around zero .",
    "on the other hand , when several peaks with comparable heights exist , the synchronization of phases is diluted , and thus the phase - sum distribution becomes almost uniform .",
    "the phase - sum distribution is sensitive to the non - gaussian feature of the density field , especially the relative strength of the most high - density peak to other density peaks .",
    "the nonlinear gravitational evolution and the nonlinearity in the galaxy biasing statistically changes the relative strength of density peaks in galaxy distribution , and therefore the phase - sum distribution is a useful tool to probe the nonlinear effects .",
    "the present analysis applies , for the first time , the above phase statistics to the sdss galaxy catalogs to quantify the non - gaussianity in galaxy distributions .",
    "there are three possible sources of the non - gaussianity in the present galaxy density field : primordial density field , nonlinear gravitational evolution , and nonlinear galaxy biasing .",
    "recently , wmap showed that the primordial density field is well approximated by gaussian statistics .",
    "thus , the primordial non - gaussianity can be safely ignored in the following analysis , and the prominent source of non - gaussianity in the galaxy distribution is nonlinear gravitational evolution . in our analysis , we use the phase statistics as a cosmological tool independent of the two - point statistics .",
    "we compare the phase correlations of sdss galaxies with those of mock samples constructed from @xmath0-body simulations based on various cosmological models . for a fair comparison with observations , we consider the observational systematic effects including the survey geometry , the redshift distortion and the shot - noise due to the sparse sampling .",
    "we find that the sdss galaxy data agree very well with the lcdm model predictions with @xmath3 , which is consistent with the results of wmap .",

    "it is known that galaxy clustering depends sensitively on various properties of galaxies , such as the luminosity , color , morphology , and environment ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the two - point statistics using sdss galaxies by @xcite and @xcite clearly exhibits the luminosity and morphology dependence of the galaxy biasing ( see also @xcite for the dependence in three - point correlation functions ) .",
    "if the density fluctuation of galaxies , @xmath64 , is related to the mass density fluctuation , @xmath65 , as @xmath66 , their fourier transforms also have the linear relationship @xmath67 . decomposing the fourier wavevectors to the parts of amplitudes and phases ,",
    "the amplitudes change proportionally to @xmath7 regardless of the scale ; however , the phases are completely preserved under linear biasing .",

    "in fact , a subsequent numerical analysis confirmed the validity of the perturbative formula , even in a fairly nonlinear regime of clustering @xcite .    the dependence of the phase - sum distribution on the sampling volume can be naturally explained as follows : the synchronization of phases becomes weak when multiple density peaks with comparable heights exist ( section [ sec : intro ] ) . because the sampling volume is larger , the number of peaks increases , and thus the phase - sum distribution approaches being uniform .",

    "<S> we present a first analysis of the clustering of sdss galaxies using the distribution function of the sum of fourier phases . </S>",
    "<S> this statistical method was recently proposed by one of the authors as a new probe of the phase correlations of cosmological density fields . since the fourier phases are statistically independent of the fourier amplitudes , the phase statistic plays a complementary role to the conventional two - point statistics of galaxy clustering . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the distribution functions of the phase sum over three closed wavevectors as a function of the triangle configuration . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the observed distribution functions of the phase sum are in good agreement with the lowest - order approximation from perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> for a direct comparison with observations , we construct mock catalogs from @xmath0-body simulations taking account of the survey geometry , the redshift distortion , and the discreteness due to the limited number of data . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the observed phase correlations for the galaxies in the range of the absolute magnitude , @xmath1 , agree well with those for @xmath2-dominated spatially flat cold dark matter predictions with @xmath3 evolved from the gaussian initial condition . </S>",
    "<S> this agreement implies that the galaxy biasing is approximately linear in redshift space . instead , assuming that the galaxy biasing is described by a quadratic deterministic function at @xmath4[@xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> , we can constrain the ratio of the quadratic biasing parameter , @xmath6 , to the linear biasing parameter , @xmath7 , from the difference of phase correlations between observations and mock predictions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the resulting @xmath8 is well fitted by @xmath9 and is almost insensitive to the cosmology and luminosity in those ranges . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , @xmath8 is nearly zero when @xmath3 . </S>"
