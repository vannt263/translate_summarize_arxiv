    "one of the most compelling problems in modern dynamo theory is the formulation of a realistic coupling between the internal magnetic field and the external field in the atmosphere .",
    "in fact the boundary conditions for the electric and the magnetic field at the stellar surface put severe constraints on the allowed coronal field configurations , and it is often necessary to resort to very crude approximations for the latter .    the standard textbook boundary condition employed in mean - field dynamo theory amounts to consider a current - free field in the region @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the stellar radius , so that @xmath3 in this domain .",
    "although in the solar case this assumption is motivated by the possibility of describing the almost rigid rotation of the coronal holes in the lower corona @xcite , it be might incorrect to extend its validity in more active stars .    in fact , as current - free fields represents the states of minimum energy under the constraint",
    "that the normal component of the field at the photosphere is fixed , they can not provide the additional energy required to sustain a significant activity level .",
    "recent measurements of faraday rotation in the solar corona support the evidence for large scale coronal currents @xcite , an essential ingredient to explain coronal heating in terms of joule dissipation . on the other hand on much smaller scales",
    "the presence of currents is unavoidable in order to explain the twisted field structure of filaments and prominences .",
    "force - free magnetic fields , defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a scalar function , can be more appealing from the physical point of view , at least for very low plasma-@xmath6 values .",
    "however , recent investigations based on direct numerical simulations have shown that the free magnetic energy and the efficiency of coronal heating via currents dissipation are still very limited in these models @xcite .",
    "an important consequence of current - free boundary conditions is that the toroidal field must identically vanish in the all domain @xmath1 . in order to illustrate this point in detail",
    "it is convenient to introduce the scalar potential @xmath7 so that the toroidal field can be written as _",
    "-_+_. it is not difficult to show that , if @xmath8 is a single valued function , @xmath9 in a volume always necessarily implies @xmath10 everywhere @xcite .",
    "in particular , if the field configuration is spherically symmetric the azimuthal component of the magnetic field must vanish at the surface , so that @xmath11 , as imposed in most of the dynamo models ( see @xcite for an interesting discussion on this issue ) .",
    "spectropolarimetric observations of photospheric magnetic fields in solar - like stars have revealed surface toroidal field which are mostly axysimmetric and have a predominant toroidal component @xcite implying that most of the magnetic energy resides in the toroidal field .",
    "this is the case of the solar - like stars like hd72905 , with 82% of the magnetic energy stored in the toroidal field which is nearly completely axisymmetric ( 97% ) , or of the g8 dwarf @xmath12 boo a with 81% of toroidal energy of which 97% is due to the axisymmetric component , or the case of hd56124 with 90% of the energy in axisymmetric field configurations , and roughly the same strength of poloidal and toroidal component .",
    "the situation is even more dramatic if one considers m dwarfs like wx uma or ad leo where nearly all the energy is stored in an axysymmetric field with prominent photospheric non - zero toroidal component ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "while in the case of the sun a similar observational strategy has confirmed that the magnetic energy is mostly ( @xmath13% ) poloidal @xcite , it is clear that the boundary conditions based on current - free coronal field might not be correct for other , more active , stars .",
    "in fact it has been further noticed that fast rotating , low mass stars have on average stronger surface toroidal fields than solar - mass slow rotators @xcite .",
    "can this fact be explained as an enhanced dynamo action due a @xmath0 mechanism ?",
    "indeed , as strong toroidal fields can alter the average atmospheric structure there is no reason to assume that a current - free field is still a reasonable approximation to discuss the magnetic energy budget in these objects .",
    "the idea proposed in this paper is that on large scales and on time scales of the order of the stellar cycle , the external field can be considered harmonic so that : [ h1 ] ^2 + k^2 = 0 dynamo . ]",
    "it will then be shown that standard mhd continuity conditions at the surface naturally allow for non - zero surface toroidal fields which is directly extrapolated from the interior field produced by the dynamo . in this letter",
    "several solutions obtained for solar - like stars will therefore be discussed and analyzed .",
    "it turns out that depending on the strength of the differential rotation and the surface meridional circulation , it is possible to obtain surface fields whose energies distribution between toroidal and poloidal components is consistent with the observations .",
    "let us assume that the field periodically evolves with a characteristic cycle frequency @xmath14 so that @xmath15",
    ". thus reads [ helm ] ( ^2 + k^2)=0 where the wavenumber @xmath16 is considered to be real .",
    "clearly we must assume that @xmath17 otherwise the typical spatial structure of the field would be too short to be consistent with our quasi - homogeneous approximation . as we shall see , as long as @xmath18 our results are not quantitatively dependent on the value of @xmath16 .    as usual ,",
    "the boundary conditions are the continuity of the normal component of the magnetic field and the tangential component of the electric field across the stellar surface , [ boundary ] [ [ ] ] = 0 , [ [ ] ] = 0 where @xmath19 is the normal to the surface . in spherical symmetry",
    "the following decomposition for the magnetic field @xmath20 can be used [ deco ] = - - ( ) _ t+_p where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are scalar functions , @xmath23 is the toroidal component and @xmath24 is the poloidal one ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the vector helmholtz equation decouples in the two scalar equations    [ hel ] [ hela ] & & ^2 + k^2=0 + & & ^2 + k^2=0 [ helb ]    and variable separation in gives    [ d1 ] & & = r _ n^p_n ( ) + & & = _ n^p_n ( )    where @xmath25 is the normalized stellar radius @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the legendre polynomials and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the spherical bessel functions . it should be remarked that @xmath31 in does not necessarily imply @xmath32 in the all @xmath1 domain , as it must instead hold in the case of a current - free field ( vacuum boundary condition ) .",
    "the @xmath33-@xmath34 constants are complex numbers whose value must be determined by the boundary conditions imposed at the stellar surface and at some finite outer radius @xmath35 where a transition to a wind dominated field topology occur @xcite . for our purposes",
    "it will be sufficient to assume that at @xmath35 the solution is radially dominated so that by matching it with parker s wind solution , so that the field has the expected @xmath36 decay at large distances . ] [ obound ] b_(r=)=b_(r=)=0 . in the stellar interior",
    "the field is described by the mean - field dynamo equation [ induction ] = ( + ) - ( ) where , as usual , @xmath37 is a pseudo - scalar function representing the turbulent @xmath37-effect , @xmath38 is the mean flow and @xmath39 is the turbulent ( eddy ) diffusivity . as before @xmath40 and we apply the fundamental decomposition for @xmath20 .",
    "at last we write    [ d2 ] = r _ n^_n(x)p_n ( ) & & + = _ n^_n(x)p_n ( ) & &    where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the complex eigenfunctions of antisymmetric parity of the linear operator ( see @xcite for details ) .    the field at the inner boundary",
    "is assumed to be a perfect conductor , but the boundary conditions at the surface imply the continuity of @xmath42 , @xmath41 and their derivatives across the boundary .",
    "it is not difficult to show that , in order for the interior solution to be consistent with the external field in the following relation must hold at @xmath43 : [ boundary2 ] + _ n = 0 where @xmath44 are determined by imposing the outer boundary condition on @xmath35 .",
    "a similar equation can be obtained for the @xmath41 components .    .",
    "in this case @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "[ fig2],scaledwidth=32.0% ]",
    "let us specialize our formalism to the case of a solar - like star .",
    "we assume the following form for the velocity field @xmath48 and we model the solar - like differential rotation in the following way : ( r , ) = _ c + ( _ s()-_c ) where @xmath49 is the location of the convection zone in units of the stellar radius , @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the uniform angular velocity of the radiative core , @xmath52 . here",
    "@xmath53 is the surface differential rotation ( in principle obtained from observations ) . for actual calculations we fixed @xmath54 and @xmath55 but @xmath56",
    "is allowed to vary .",
    "the radial profile of the turbulent diffusivity is assumed to be the following : [ eta ] = _ c + ( _ t-_c)with @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath37 effect is proportional to @xmath58 and its radial profile is assumed to be uniformly distributed in all the convection zone ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the meridional circulation @xmath59 is obtained from the stream function @xmath60 which as explained in @xcite @xmath60 can be obtained from an underlying stellar model .",
    "the flow as usual is equatorwards at the equator and poleward at the surface .    as usual",
    ", let us introduce the following dynamo numbers , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the rotation rate at the equator and @xmath66 is the maximumm strength of @xmath67 at the bottom of the convection zone .",
    "the resulting eigenvalue problem can be conveniently solved by inverting a block - diagonal complex matrix @xcite which must be truncated to the desired numerical accuracy . for calculations we used the kinematic dynamo code ctdyn ,",
    "developed by the author and extensively tested in @xcite .",
    "our results are summarized in table ( [ tab1 ] ) .",
    ".summary of the numerical simulations .",
    "in particular it shows how @xmath68 depends on @xmath69 and various other input parameters (  vac \" stands for current - free boundary condition ) .",
    "@xmath70 is the model name , and in particular for model j the toroidal and poloidal field are displayed in at various values of the cycle phase .",
    "[ tab1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us first stress that the @xmath68 at the surface is non - zero and it is now an increasing function of @xmath69 , an effect clearly expected for an @xmath0 dynamo .",
    "the surface differential rotation also plays an important role because it strongly influences the value of @xmath68 , as it can be deduced by looking at models e and f for instance . on the contrary",
    ", it should also be noticed the decrease of @xmath68 as the flow is increased ( see models j , l , m for instance ) .",
    "this fact has a clear physical interpretation : as the flow is poleward below the surface , the toroidal belts become more and more confined below the surface at high @xmath71 .",
    "it is also reassuring to notice that , as long as @xmath72 our results are not sensitive to the choice of @xmath12 . on the other hand , with the new boundary conditions the value of the critical @xmath73 is in general smaller than with the standard current - free boundary conditions as it can be observed by looking at models f and g. we also verified that our results are not qualitatively dependent on the location of the external boundary @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , low mass stars with more extended convection zone have in general higher values of @xmath68 , if @xmath69 is large enough , as discussed in the model of .    if the dynamo action is instead driven by the meridional circulation ( as in mean field models of the solar dynamo ) the new boundary condition does not alter the internal dynamo action because the toroidal field is localized at the bottom of the convection zone .    in the case of a generic @xmath0",
    "advection - dominated dynamo action we observe a change of sign of the dimensionless ratio @xmath75 from positive ( in the norther hemisphere ) in the turbulent zone in the interior to negative in the exterior .",
    "the opposite happens in the southern hemisphere as one can see in . a similar change of sign between the turbulent zone and the exterior has also been observed in @xcite , although in our mean - field models the current helicity is mostly negative in the outer layers in the norther hemisphere .",
    "the description of the external field in terms of solution of the helmholtz equation allowed us to extrapolate the internal toroidal field generated by the dynamo on the photosphere , and finally to make contact with the observations .",
    "the assumption beyond this idea is the possibility of treating the corona as an external passive medium with effective macroscopic dielectric properties , if averaged over long enough time scales . although this approach oversimplifies the complex physics of the corona , in our opinion it represents a significant improvement of the current - free boundary conditions for which @xmath76 on the surface , at least in some class of very active stars .",
    "the resulting dynamo numbers are in general smaller than the standard critical dynamo numbers ; the ratio @xmath68 increases with @xmath69 and with a more extended convection zone , and decreases with @xmath71 .",
    "indeed , fast rotating stars with larger convection zone should approach a cylindrical rotation law in the interior with a smaller surface meridional circulation .",
    "a detailed study of all the parameter space and a comparison with the global topologies inferred from observations will be discussed in a longer paper .",
    "we also plan to extend this investigation including non - axisymmetric solutions of higher azimuthal modes .",
    "i would like to thank the colleagues of the mhd group of the leibniz institute for astrophysics in potsdam for important comments and hospitality .",
    "i am also indebted to rim fares for clarifications on zeeman - doppler imaging and on magnetic field topology reconstruction and to the anonymous referee for his constructive criticism ."
