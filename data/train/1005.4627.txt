    "density of hyperbolicity is one of the central problems in one - dimensional dynamics .",
    "hyperbolic systems have simple behavior and are easy to understand .",
    "hence the question whether any system in a given parameter space can be perturbed to a hyperbolic one is of great importance .",
    "recently , there has been major progress on this problem for real one - dimensional dynamics .",
    "lyubich @xcite and , independently , graczyk and witek @xcite solved the problem for the real quadratic family @xmath2 , while it was solved for real polynomials with real critical points by kozlovski , shen and the second author in @xcite and for general interval maps and circle maps in @xcite .",
    "for a discussion of related results , see @xcite .    as an example of questions that are left open by these results ,",
    "let us consider the most famous family of circle maps : the _",
    "arnold family _",
    "@xmath3 this family describes the behaviour of a periodically forced nonlinear oscillator , and has been used to model a variety of physical and biological systems .",
    "it is well - known that hyperbolicity is dense in the region where the map is a circle diffeomorphism , i.e.  for @xmath4 . in the non - invertible case , @xmath5 , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) implies that @xmath6 can be perturbed to a hyperbolic circle map , and indeed to a hyperbolic trigonometric polynomial of high degree .",
    "however , we would like the perturbation to be an element of the same family ; that is , we ask whether the set of parameters @xmath7 for which both critical points belong to the basins of periodic attractors is dense in the region @xmath5 ( figure [ fig : arnold ] ) .",
    "this question , and in fact even the density of _ structural stability _ ( see below ) , has so far remained open .    .",
    "[ fig : arnold]white regions correspond to points where a numerical experiment indicates both critical points being attracted to attracting cycles .",
    "the critical line @xmath8 is indicated in grey ; note that the arnold tongues in the invertible region lead to hyperbolic components above the critical line , but that other hyperbolic regions exist also . ]    as a further example , we discuss the families of _ real cosine maps _ and _ degenerate standard maps _ : @xmath9 these are natural families of transcendental entire functions .",
    "( the study of transcendental dynamics , which goes back to fatou , has received increasing attention recently , partly due to the discovery of deep connections with polynomial and rational dynamics .",
    "we refer e.g.  to @xcite for some examples . )",
    "again , @xcite implies that each of the functions above can be approximated by a hyperbolic _ polynomial _ of high degree , but we should look for hyperbolic perturbations within the families ; see figure [ fig : cosine ] .",
    "( in the case of @xmath10 , our definition of hyperbolicity will need to be adapted ; see definition [ defn : realhyperbolic ] below . )    . as in figure",
    "[ fig : arnold ] , white regions correspond to hyperbolic maps . ]",
    "we shall give positive answers to all of the above questions and in fact establish density of hyperbolicity in a large general class of parameter spaces of transcendental entire functions and circle maps . to do so , we must abandon the proof strategy of @xcite , which relies heavily on the use of _ polynomial - like mappings_. instead , we return to the methods of @xcite .",
    "the difficulty here is that we require global rigidity statements , in particular regarding the _ absence of invariant line fields _ on the complex plane , which become more difficult to establish given that our functions are transcendental . in order to prove our results",
    ", we shall need to combine and adapt a number of ingredients :    1 .",
    "rigidity results for maps of the interval and circle maps ; 2 .",
    "rigidity results for the dynamics of transcendental entire functions near infinity ; 3 .",
    "an argument to establish the absence of invariant line fields on certain subsets of the complex plane ; 4 .",
    "the function - theoretic construction of natural parameter spaces .",
    "as far as we know , density of hyperbolicity had not previously been established in any nontrivial family of transcendental functions .",
    "if @xmath11 is a transcendental entire function , we denote by @xmath12 the _ set of ( finite ) singular values _ of @xmath13 .",
    "that is , @xmath14 is the smallest closed set such that @xmath15 is an unbranched covering .    when studying density of hyperbolicity , it is reasonable to restrict to the _ speiser class _ of transcendental entire functions for which @xmath12 is finite . indeed , for maps with infinite sets of singular values",
    ", the associated natural parameter spaces will be infinite - dimensional , the number of periodic attractors may become infinite , there might exist wandering domains , and even density of structural stability may fail .",
    "in fact , it is not entirely clear whether `` hyperbolicity '' is a notion that makes sense when the set @xmath12 is unbounded .",
    "since we are interested in real dynamics , we will consider only _ real _ transcendental entire functions ; i.e.  those that satisfy @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that all singular values are also real ; i.e. we study the class @xmath17 this is a reasonable restriction if our goal is study hyperbolicity in the complex sense .",
    "it seems sensible to expect that density of hyperbolicity _ on the real line _ also holds without the assumption that @xmath18 , but our current methods will not yield this .",
    "we note that a function @xmath19 may have non - real critical _ points _ , but only real critical _",
    "values_.    to study density of hyperbolicity we need to first clarify what perturbations we allow .",
    "it is natural to only allow perturbations which preserve the global properties of the original map ( for example , if a function is bounded on the real line , the approximating map should have the same property ) .",
    "it turns out that the correct notion is to seek perturbations of a map @xmath13 that are of the form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 belong to the class @xmath23 of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of the complex plane that restrict to order - preserving homeomorphisms of the real line .",
    "our first result concerns maps @xmath19 that are bounded on the real axis .",
    "[ thm : perturbbounded ] suppose @xmath19 is bounded is on the real axis .",
    "then there exist @xmath24 arbitrarily close to the identity such that @xmath25 is entire and hyperbolic .",
    "another ( more practical ) point of view is to study perturbations that belong to natural families of functions in @xmath26 .",
    "using theorem [ thm : perturbbounded ] , we can deduce the following result in this spirit .",
    "we denote by @xmath27 the set of all affine maps @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",

    "@xmath13 is called _ hyperbolic _ if every singular value belongs to a basin of attraction .",
    "assumption ( [ item : numbersingular ] ) is needed : as in @xcite it is not hard to construct @xmath43-parameter families with @xmath44 so that _ no _ map within this family is hyperbolic .",
    "we note that it is possible to embed every @xmath19 with @xmath45 in an @xmath33-dimensional family @xmath46 satisfying ( [ item : numbersingular ] ) and ( [ item : nontrivial ] ) in a natural fashion ( see section [ sec : parameter ] ) . furthermore",
    ", if @xmath47 is bounded , then all elements of this family will also be bounded .",
    "as a particular case , the above theorems give density of hyperbolicity in the real cosine family mentioned above .",
    "it also holds for general real trigonometric polynomials for which all critical values are real .",
    "( see also corollary  [ cor : trigopol ] below for a more general statement regarding circle maps . )",
    "the set of parameters @xmath48 for which the cosine map @xmath49 is hyperbolic forms an open and dense subset of @xmath50 .",
    "more generally , let @xmath31 .",
    "then hyperbolicity is dense in the space of real trigonometric polynomials @xmath51 for which all critical values are real .",
    "all functions @xmath49 belong to the class @xmath26 , with exactly two critical values and no asymptotic values .",
    "furthermore , no two different maps @xmath49 are conjugate by a mbius transformation @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 ( lemma [ lem : cos ] ) .",
    "we note that if @xmath13 is a trigonometric polynomial and @xmath55 is entire with @xmath21 and @xmath22 close to the identity , then @xmath56 is conformally conjugate to a trigonometric polynomial of the same degree whose coefficients are close to those of @xmath13 ( lemma [ lem : trig ] ) .",
    "hence the claims above do indeed follow from theorems [ thm : densitybounded ] and [ thm : perturbbounded ] .    for functions that are unbounded along the real axis , such as the family @xmath10 , we need to relax our notion of hyperbolicity somewhat .",
    "the reason is that such maps may have singular values that `` escape to infinity '' ( i.e. , converge to infinity under iteration ) .",
    "such maps are not hyperbolic in the complex sense , as @xmath57 is not a hyperbolic attractor .",
    "however , such a singular value can not be perturbed into an attracting basin by a _ real _ perturbation . for example , consider the real exponential family , @xmath58 , @xmath59 . for @xmath60 , @xmath61 is hyperbolic , but for @xmath62 , the singular value @xmath63 , and indeed every real starting value @xmath64 , converges to @xmath57 under iteration . while these maps are not hyperbolic in the complex plane , it seems reasonable to describe their action on @xmath65 as hyperbolic , motivating the following definition .",
    "[ defn : realhyperbolic ] a function @xmath66 is called _ real - hyperbolic _ if every singular value either belongs to a basin of attraction or tends to infinity under iteration .",
    "when @xmath47 is bounded , this corresponds to the usual definition of hyperbolicity .",
    "we should note that , if @xmath46 is a family of functions in @xmath26 for which the number of singular values is constant , then any real - hyperbolic parameter @xmath67 for which there are _ no critical relations _ is _ real - structurally stable _ within the family . by this",
    "we mean that any nearby map @xmath46 is conjugate to @xmath68 on the real line .",
    "( however , they are not necessarily conjugate in the complex plane ; indeed @xmath69 and @xmath70 are not topologically conjugate for @xmath71 , see @xcite . ) here we say that @xmath13 has no critical relations if no critical point or asymptotic value of @xmath13 is eventually mapped onto a critical point .",
    "indeed , real - structural stability follows from the fact that @xmath68 and a nearby map will be combinatorially and hence topologically conjugate on the real line ( see lemma [ lem : comb - conj ] ) .",
    "it is reasonable to conjecture that real - hyperbolicity is dense in every full parameter space in @xmath26 . in this paper",
