    "the galactic center ( gc ) region of our galaxy is a unique concentration of stars and molecular clouds , in addition to sgr  a@xmath0 , a @xmath1  m@xmath2 massive black hole ( mbh ) at the gravitational center ( for a recent review , see genzel & eckart  1999 ) .",
    "the inner @xmath3  pc region of the galaxy is a site of a nuclear starburst and consequently should be populated by a variety of x - ray sources , such as x - ray binaries , supernova remnants , and young stellar clusters .",
    "_ asca _ revealed diffuse emissions of @xmath4 extent centered at sgr  a@xmath0 and asymmetrical structure extending @xmath5 along the galactic plane ( koyama et al .",
    "1996 ; maeda et al .",
    "the spectral characteristics were most remarkable , exhibiting many k - shell lines from highly ionized atoms , with particularly enhanced emission from he - like ( 6.70 kev ) and h - like ( 6.97 kev ) irons .",
    "early _ chandra _ results confirmed the _",
    "asca _ findings and resolved numerous x - ray structures : x - ray binaries , diffuse structures , emission from the supernova remnant sgr  a - east , emission from individual stars within the sgr  a region , and a possible x - ray counterpart of the massive black hole sgr  a@xmath0 with a luminosity of only 10@xmath6 erg  s@xmath7 ( baganoff et al .",
    "2000 ) , which is extremely low compared to typical massive black holes .    among these many x - ray objects ,",
    "the most massive molecular cloud sgr  b2 in the galaxy is extraordinary .",
    "it exhibits a very peculiar spectrum with a strong emission line at 6.4 kev , a low energy cutoff below 4  kev and a pronounced edge - structure at 7.1  kev .",
    "the x - ray image is shifted from the core of the molecular cloud toward the gc by about 1@xmath83 ( murakami et al .",
    "recently _ chandra _ confirmed these results : the extended structure of the 6.4 kev line image with a convex shape pointed towards sgr  a@xmath0 and its offset morphology from the cloud core ( murakami et al .",
    "a numerical simulation demonstrated that the offset morphology and the line and edge dominated spectrum are well reproduced by the reflection of external x - rays coming from the direction of the gc ( figure 2 , murakami et al .",
    "2000a ; also in sunyaev et al .",
    "1998 ) . based on this , they proposed sgr  b2 to be a new class of x - ray object , an _ x - ray reflection nebula _",
    "( xrn ) . however , there is no adequately bright source in the immediate sgr  b2 vicinity to fully account for the fluorescence .",
    "they suspected that the most likely source is an x - ray outburst from the mbh at sgr  a@xmath0 despite its considerable distance from sgr  b2 ( koyama et al .",
    "1996 ; murakami et al .",
    "their model requires an outburst of @xmath9 erg  s@xmath7 for at least 10 years and must have stopped at most 30 years ago to avoid detection by earlier x - ray astronomical instruments .",
    "such an outburst from a @xmath10  m@xmath2 mbh , perhaps caused by a surge in accretion rate , is consistent with the behavior of active galactic nuclei .",
    "the xrn scenario and the putative past x - ray outburst of the galactic nucleus sgr  a@xmath0 may indicate that there should be many other xrns in the gc region .",
    "we therefore examined the archival _ asca _ data of the gc region in detail , and found another xrn candidate in the sgr  c region , located at the same projected distance as sgr  b2 from the gc , but in the opposite direction .",
    "the _ asca _ observations of sgr  c were made on 1993 october  4 .",
    "all four focal plane instruments , two solid - state imaging spectrometers ( sis0 , sis1 ) and two gas imaging spectrometers ( gis2 , gis3 ) were operated in parallel , providing four independent data sets .",
    "details of the instruments , the telescopes and the detectors , are found in tanaka , inoue , & holt ( 1994 ) , serlemitsos et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , burke et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , ohashi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , makishima et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and gotthelf ( 1996 ) .",
    "each of the giss was operated in ph mode with the standard bit - assignment , while the sis was operated in 4-ccd bright mode .",
    "the data were post - processed to correct for spatial gain non - linearity .",
    "data taken at geomagnetic cutoff rigidities lower than 6  gv , at elevation angles less than 5@xmath11 from the earth rim , or during the passage through the south atlantic anomaly were excluded . after these filterings , the net observing time was 20  ksec .",
    "the key characteristic of xrns is a strong iron line at 6.4  kev ( koyama et al . 1996 ; sunyaev & churazov 1998 ; murakami et al .",
    "2000a ) , hence we made a narrow energy band image with a central energy of 6.4  kev and a width of twice the energy resolution ( fwhm ) : 5.87.0  kev for the gis .",
    "figure  1 shows the gis image overlaid with the contour map of the cold cloud density distribution contour by the radio observation of cs with the radial velocity of @xmath12  km  s@xmath7 to @xmath13  km  s@xmath7 ( figure  3 in tsuboi , handa , & ukita 1999 ) .",
    "the position accuracy is about 5 `` for the radio map , and 24 '' for the gis image ( gotthelf et al .",
    "the 6.4 kev band image shows an x - ray peak ( inner region of the solid circle ) near the molecular cloud core co  @xmath14 ( oka et al . 1998 ) , which is one of the giant molecular clouds in the sgr  c complex , with a mass of @xmath15 10@xmath16  m@xmath2 .",
    "we therefore suspect that the x - ray emission is associated with the molecular cloud sgr  c , although a more detailed comparison will require more accurate positional observations both in x - rays and radio bands .",
    "we made x - ray spectra using the x - ray photons in a circle of 2@xmath87 radius around the x - ray peak ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "since the sgr  c region is in the large scale gc plasma ( koyama et al .",
    "1996 ) , the spectrum may be contaminated by the emission of he- and h - like iron lines ( 6.70 kev , and 6.97 kev ) . in order to properly subtract these highly ionized iron lines , the background region",
    "is selected as a 2@xmath87 radius region with the same galactic latitude ( dotted circle in figure  1 ) .",
    "figure  2 shows the background subtracted gis spectrum .",
    "we made a model spectrum with a power - law continuum and a gaussian line , folding with the _ asca _ response function , and fitted it to the data .",
    "due to the limited statistics , we fixed the power - law photon index @xmath17 to be 2.0 ( number of photons @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the photon energy ) , the same value as assumed for sgr  b2 ( koyama et al .",
    "1996 ; murakami et al .",
    "the fit is acceptable , with the best - fit parameters shown in table  1 .",
    "the central energy of the line appears at 6.28@xmath20  kev , in agreement with the fluorescent line from neutral irons .",
    "the line equivalent width and absorption column density are both very large : @xmath15 0.8  kev and 1.3@xmath21  h  @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "since the galactic diffuse background may not be uniform , we checked the ambiguity of the background selection .",
    "we selected three other background regions with the same galactic latitude as the source region , and fitted them with the same model .",
    "the best - fit parameters of the line central energy and the absorption are in the range of statistical errors .",
    "the absorbed flux differs a little larger than the error , however this flux variation is not serious for the discussion in section 4 .    adding two narrow gaussian lines at 6.4 and 6.7 kev on a power - law continuum",
    ", we found that the 6.7-kev line from highly ionized iron is very weak ; the upper limit of 9 @xmath23 erg  s@xmath7  @xmath22 is about 1/4 of the best - fit value of the 6.4-kev line .",
    "we thus conclude that the emission line from the sgr  c cloud is dominated by the fluorescent line from cold irons .",
    "we also made an sis spectrum from the same region of gis , and fitted it with the same model as with the gis .",
    "the best - fit spectral parameters are shown in table  1 , and are consistent with those obtained from the gis spectrum .",
    "due to the limited statistics , the sis spectrum does not further constrain the spectral parameters .",
    "we thus discuss the x - ray properties of sgr  c using the spectral parameters obtained with gis only .",
    "we have found a hard x - ray enhancement near the sgr  c cloud on the 6.4  kev line map .",
    "the spectrum shows a strong fluorescent line at 6.4  kev and the large absorption in low energy band .",
    "these properties are good evidence that sgr  c is a new xrn ( sunyaev & churazov 1998 ; murakami et al .",
    "2000a ) .",
    "murakami et  al .",
    "( 2000a ) analyzed the spectrum of sgr  b2 , the xrn , and found that the equivalent width of the 6.4  kev line is 2.9@xmath24  kev , and the column density of hydrogen is 8.3@xmath25  h  @xmath22 .",
    "those of sgr  c are 0.8@xmath26  kev and 1.3@xmath27  h  @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the absorption of sgr  c is smaller than that of sgr  b2 by an order of magnitude .",
    "this is reasonable because the mass of the sgr  c cloud is about 1/7 of the sgr  b2 cloud ( oka et al .",
    "1998 ) , in spite of rather similar geometrical size .",
    "in fact , using the sgr  c cloud size of @xmath15 28  pc ( oka et  al .",
    "1998 ) , we can roughly estimate the column density to be 4 @xmath28  h  @xmath22 , which is almost equal to 1.3 @xmath29  h  @xmath22 , after taking account of the interstellar absorption to the sgr  c cloud of @xmath30  h  @xmath22 ( sakano et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the absorption column of 4 @xmath31 h  @xmath22 is in the optically thin range near 6.4  kev and above 7.1  kev energy , hence , unlike sgr  b2 , the 6.4  kev emission region should overlap the molecular core .",
    "this is in agreement with the observation , although the observational results still have significant uncertainty .      in the optically thin case ,",
    "the x - ray intensity of an xrn is simply proportional to the amount of the scattering matter and the flux of the irradiating x - rays .",
    "the absorption - corrected luminosity of the 6.4  kev line from sgr  c is 4 @xmath32 erg  s@xmath7 within a 2@xmath87-radius circular region .",
    "the required luminosity of the x - ray source irradiating sgr  c would be about 3 @xmath33 ( @xmath34/100 pc)@xmath35 erg  s@xmath7 , where @xmath34 is the distance from the irradiating x - ray source to sgr  c.    the brightest nearby x - ray source is 1e  1740.7@xmath362942 , which lies only @xmath15 0.4 degrees from sgr  c. during the present observation , its luminosity was @xmath37  erg  s@xmath7 in the 210  kev band ( sakano et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this luminosity , however , is two orders of magnitude less than that required to account for the fluorescent x - rays from sgr  c. even if we accumulate the x - ray fluxes from all cataloged bright x - ray sources near the gc ( sakano 2000 ) , we can explain only 2 % of the reflected luminosity of sgr  c. this fact strengthens the scenario that the x - rays from sgr  c , as well as those from sgr  b2 , is due to the reflection from an irradiating source which was very bright in the past but is presently dim .",
    "the x - ray fluxes of sgr  b2 and sgr  c can be consistently explained by one irradiating source , if it is located at almost the same distance from both of the xrns .",
    "this position falls near the galactic nucleus sgr  a@xmath0 , and the x - ray luminosity should be as luminous as 3 @xmath33  erg  s@xmath7 about 300 years ago , the light travel time from sgr  a@xmath0 to sgr  b2 and sgr  c.",
    "\\1 . we have discovered diffuse emission in the 6.4 kev band from the sgr  c region based on the _ asca _ observations .",
    "the line dominated spectrum and the image correlated with a molecular cloud are similar to those of the prototypical x - ray reflection nebula ( xrn ) sgr  b2 , and thus sgr  c can be regarded as a new xrn .",
