    "quantum chromodynamics before 1975 considered the following lagrangian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the diagonal , @xmath2-free , real quark mass matrix . but",
    "after 1975 , the following term is known to be prensent in general in a world without a massless quark , @xmath3 since this @xmath4 term violates cp invariance , the upper bound of the neutron electric dipole moment puts a strong constraint on the magnitude of @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "the smallness of @xmath4 has led to the strong cp problem , @xmath6why is @xmath4 so small ? \"  @xcite    we know that many small parameters in physics have led to new ideas , in most cases leading to new symmetries .",
    "for example , @xmath7 has led to supersymmetry , @xmath8 gev has led to @xmath9 chiral symmetry , etc . for the strong cp problem ,",
    "the nicest solution is the very light axion resulting from the peccei - quinn symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the reason that the axion solves the strong cp problem is the following .",
    "this argument is due to ref .",
    "@xcite . in the axion solution",
    ", @xmath4 is a dynamical field , but for a moment let us treat it as a parameter ( or coupling constant ) .",
    "the partition function in the euclidian space after integrating out the quark fields is @xmath10}\\equiv\\int [ da_\\mu]\\prod_i{\\rm det}(d^\\mu\\gamma_\\mu + m_i)\\exp[-\\int d^4x({1\\over 4g^2}f^2-i\\bar\\theta\\{f\\tilde f\\})]\\ ] ] where @xmath11 includes the factor @xmath12 .",
    "it is known that det factor in the above equation is positive @xcite .",
    "also note that the @xmath4 term is pure imaginary .",
    "therefore , using schwarz inequality , we obtain the following inequality @xmath13}\\le \\int [ da_\\mu]\\left|\\prod_i{\\rm det}(d^\\mu\\gamma_\\mu+m_i)\\exp [ -\\int d^4x({1\\over 4g^2}f^2-i\\bar\\theta\\{f\\tilde f\\})]\\right| \\nonumber\\\\ & = \\int [ da_\\mu]\\prod_i{\\rm det } ( d^\\mu\\gamma_\\mu+m_i)\\exp [ -\\int d^4x{1\\over 4g^2}f^2]=e^{-\\int d^4x v[0]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which gives @xmath14\\ge v[0].\\ ] ] thus @xmath15 is the minimum . however , if @xmath4 is a coupling constant , any @xmath4 can be a good coupling constant as any @xmath16 is allowed theoretically .",
    "the axion solution interprets @xmath4 as a dynamical field , introducing a kinetic energy term for for the boson field @xmath4 . in this case",
    ", we necessarily introduce a mass parameter @xmath17 , accompanying the axion @xmath18 , @xmath19 then the shape of the potential of @xmath18 is as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the hight of the potential is guessed to be of order @xmath20 .",
    "the current algebra calculation gives @xmath21 .",
    "since the instanton solution gives @xmath22 and @xmath23 appears in the form given in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , _ @xmath4 is a periodic variable with period @xmath24 . _",
    "since @xmath4 is a dynamical field , different @xmath4 s do not describe different theories , but merely different vacua .",
    "thus , as universe evolves , @xmath4 seeks the minimum of the potential @xmath15 .",
    "this mechanism explains very elegantly why @xmath4 is so small in our universe . the above proof assumed no cp violation except that from the @xmath4 term , and the weak cp violation shifts the minimum point very little , @xmath25  @xcite which is far below than the bound given by the neutron electric dipole moment .",
    "an important feature is that @xmath18 does not have any potential except that coming from @xmath26 , otherwise the mechanism does not work .",
    "the effect of weak cp violation introduces a potential , but as commented above the effect is very small .    to make @xmath4 dynamical",
    ", one must have a mechanism to introduce a scale @xmath17 .",
    "depending on the nature of @xmath18 , one can classify axion models into three broad categories : + ( i ) @xmath18 is the goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken chiral @xmath27 symmetry .",
    "the divergence of this @xmath27 current must carry the color anomaly @xmath28 so that @xmath29 coupling arises .",
    "@xmath30    \\(ii ) @xmath18 is a _ fundamental field _ in string models .",
    "the scale @xmath17 arises from the compactification .",
    "it is called the model - independent axion  @xcite + ( iii ) @xmath18 is a composite field .",
    "@xmath17 arises at the confinement scale  @xcite .",
    "+      because @xmath4 is a periodic variable , the axion potential looks like as the one shown in fig .  2 .",
    "in this example , the origin @xmath31 is identified with the vacuum @xmath32 both of which are denoted as black dots .",
    "thus , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the three degenerate vacua , distinguished by a black dot , a star , and a triangle .",
    "since the discrete symmetry of vacua is spontaneously broken in the evolving universe , there appear three kinds of domain walls , i.e. @xmath35 in our example , in the evolving universe .",
    "this leads to the so - called axionic domain wall problem  @xcite .",
    "however , if @xmath36 , there seems to be no domain wall problem even if they are formed in the evolving universe .",
    "this is because the string domain wall network system in the @xmath36 model can be erased easily .",
    "a large string attached with a large domain wall dies out due to punched holes in the wall expands with light velocity erasing the wall .    if a singlet scalar field develops a vev @xmath37 , usually the axion coupling to the gluons has the form @xmath38 which implies that the coupling is smaller by a factor @xmath39 .",
    "thus the axion mass is larger by a factor @xmath39 if one uses the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field .",
    "however , if one uses @xmath17 , there does not appear the dependence on @xmath39 as is evident from the definition of @xmath17 in eq .",
    "one can imagine a possibility that @xmath40 gev scalar vacuum expectation value with @xmath41 can be consistent with the cosmological bound .",
    "but in this case , of course , @xmath42 gev .",
    "@xmath43      string models include massless bosons @xmath44 , and dilaton @xmath45 . among these",
    ", @xmath46 is of our interest here .",
    "any @xmath47 dimensional index @xmath1 can take @xmath48 transverse directions for a massless particle",
    ". therefore , @xmath46 has @xmath49 physical degrees . in 4 dimensional minkowski space time , @xmath50 has one physical degree ; thus it is a pseudoscalar .",
    "the pseudoscalar is the dual of the field strength of @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is called the model - independent axion ( mia ) in string models  @xcite .",
    "the mia coupling is universal to all fermions @xmath54 of course , the coupling of @xmath53 is only of the derivative form , rendering the nonlinear global symmetry , @xmath55 ( costant ) .",
    "this symmetry is anomalous and the mia coupling is universal to all gauge groups where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are yang - mills and lorentz chern - simons three forms . ]",
    "@xmath58 since any superstring model possesses mia , the axion solution of the strong cp problem gets a firm theoretical support in string models .",
    "but the axion decay constant is too big in a naive string models  @xcite . in anomalous @xmath27 models , however ,",
    "the axion decay constant can be lowered  @xcite .",
    "remembering that the axion is a dynamical @xmath4 , we can easily derive its interaction terms .",
    "for this , we follow a simple route of effective field theory .",
    "the simplest axion example is the heavy quark axion  @xcite .",
    "note that the axion models should provide a pseudoscalar @xmath18 , coupling to @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath18 is housed in the complex scalar singlet field @xmath59 . by introducing a heavy quark @xmath60 ,",
    "the following yukawa coupling is introduced , @xmath61 this model posseses a global peccei - quinn symmetry , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "the vev @xmath64 gives a mass to @xmath60 , and produces a goldstone boson @xmath18 where @xmath65 .",
    "below the scale @xmath17 , the light fields are the gluons and @xmath18 .",
    "the lagrangian respecting the above symmetry is @xmath66 thus , minimally we created a dynamical variable @xmath67 .",
    "it is redefined as @xmath68 by shifting the @xmath18 field . from now on",
    ", @xmath69 implies @xmath4 .",
    "next , let us introduce the known light quarks",
    ". as the first extension , let us consider the up quark condensation in one - flavor qcd .",
    "the mass term in this theory is given by @xmath70 formally , we can assign the following @xmath27 chiral transformation , @xmath71 due to the above chiral symmetry , we expect the following effective potential below the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath72 , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the higher order terms , @xmath75 s are couplings of order 1 , @xmath76 , and the qcd scale @xmath72 is inserted to make up the correct dimension .",
    "in addition , @xmath77 , etc is multiplied to respect the @xmath27 symmetry .",
    "note that if @xmath78 and @xmath69 is not a dynamical variable , then the strong cp problem is not solved .",
    "note that , if @xmath79 then only the @xmath80-independent terms survive , leading to @xmath81 thus , redefining the @xmath82 field as @xmath83 @xmath84 the @xmath69 dependence is completely removed from @xmath85 .",
    "the @xmath69 parameter is unphysical if a quark is massless .",
    "namely , the massless up quark scenario solves the strong cp problem even though it obtains a constituent quark mass .",
    "the relevance of this solution hinges on the viability in hadron physics phenomenology @xcite . for @xmath86 , at the minimum @xmath87 , the mass matrix is @xmath88 it is easy to calculate determinant of @xmath89 @xmath90 for @xmath91 , we obtain @xmath92 .",
    "thus the axion mass is @xmath93 which is supposed to be positive .",
    "otherwise we should have chosen @xmath94 .",
    "this axion mass shows the essential feature : it is suppressed by @xmath17 and multiplied by @xmath80 .",
    "the rest is the condensation parameters .",
    "usually , the condensation parameters are given in two or three quark flavors .      for two flavors of @xmath95 and @xmath96",
    ", we can repeat the above argument with @xmath97 symmetry @xmath98 the effective potential respecting the above symmetry is @xmath99 we can diagonalize the @xmath100 mass matrix of @xmath101 and @xmath82 where the phases of @xmath102 and @xmath103 are proportional to @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "@xmath69 is proportional to @xmath106 .",
    "the axion mass is @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "the above mass formula is valid for the very light ( or invisible ) axion . for the pqww axion we need an extra consideration of separating out the longitudinal degree of the @xmath109 boson . below the chiral symmetry breaking scale",
    "the axion lagrangian is @xmath110 the interaction terms depend on models .",
    "the ksvz axion  @xcite introduces a heavy quark @xmath60 , @xmath111 where @xmath59 provides @xmath18 .",
    "the light quarks does not transform under the shift of @xmath18 . at tree level",
    ", there does not exists an axion - electron coupling and it can be induced at one - loop order .",
    "the dfsz axion  @xcite introduces two higgs doublets @xmath112 where @xmath18 resides mostly in @xmath59 with a small leakage to @xmath113 and @xmath114 ; phases of @xmath115 where @xmath116 . depending on models , @xmath117 , or the third higgs doublet",
    "@xmath118 can couple to the electron .",
    "for the first two cases , the electron coupling arises at tree level , @xmath119 .      in view of the possible detection of the cosmic axions in a high - q cavities immersed in the strong magnetic fields  @xcite ,",
    "it is important to know the axion  photon  photon couplings .",
    "more than a decade ago  @xcite , it was calculated , but the current citation of the coupling is not accurate .",
    "the details of the ksvz and dfsz couplings are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . the chiral symmetry breaking at 100 mev shifts the @xmath121 coupling .",
    "thus the coupling is usually expressed as @xmath122 where we used @xmath123 in the last equation .",

    "the peccei - quinn charge is derived from the currents obtained from the lagrangians given in eqs . ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) , @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the ratio of the higgs doublet vev s .",

    ", there can be many heavy quarks which carry nontrivial peccei - quinn charges , e.g. as in ref .",
    "for example , superstring models usually have more than 400 chiral fields . also , the light quarks are most likely to carry the peccei - quinn charges .",
    "therefore , these effects add up .",
    "in superstring , different models give different values for @xmath134 .",
    "if the standard string model is known , we can predict the exact value of @xmath134 in such a model .",
    "for a sufficiently large @xmath17 , axions produced in the stellar core escape the star easily , which provides an efficient way of the energy loss mechanism . comparing this axion emission process with the standard energy loss mechanism through neutrino emission",
    "gives a bound on @xmath17 .",
    "the production cross section is the dominant bottle neck .",
    "thus the stellar bound is such that enough axions are not produced , giving a lower bound on @xmath17 .",
    "any axion model has the primakoff process of the axion production and nucleon collision process of the axion production .",
    "the dfsz model has additional compton type axion production and similar electron ( or positron ) scattering axion production processes .",
    "but for @xmath135 gev which is of our interest here , both the ksvz and dfsz models have similar lower bounds .",
    "the astrophysical bounds are reviewed extensively in the literature  @xcite .",
    "for example , from sun one obtains @xmath136 gev , from red giants one obtains @xmath137 gev , from globular clusters one obtains @xmath138 gev . for the supernova , iwamoto and others studied before the discovery of sn1987a  @xcite . but these pre - sn1987a papers failed to give a strong lower bound .",
    "after sn1987a , many groups obtained the lower bound of order @xmath139 gev  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy of the numerical studies before and after the discovery of sn1987a was due to the axion couplings used in the analyses .",
    "of course , the correct coupling is of the derivative form @xmath140 with nucleon @xmath141 .",
    "the correct goldstone boson nature of the pion is also important as pointed out in ref .",

    "but the condition for @xmath36 is not necessary if the reheating temperature after inflation falls below @xmath17 . in supergravity models , the gravitinos which interacts very weakly with observable sector particles decay so late in cosmic time scale that they can dissociate the preciously nucleosynthesized light elements unless @xmath149 gev  @xcite .",
    "these arguments favor a low reheating temperature , presumably below @xmath17 .",
    "then the axionic strings and domain walls are not important at present .",
    "thus the reliable constraint from cosmology is the cold axion energy density  @xcite .",
    "this arises from the reason of the invisible axion s extremely feeble coupling so that its lifetime is many orders larger than the age of the universe .",

    "therefore , only @xmath36 models are viable . even for the @xmath36 case , the string - wall system generates considerable energy .",
    "one group asserts that the string - wall system outweighs the cold axions  @xcite , while the other group advocates energy density of axions from walls is comparable to or smaller than the cold misalignment axions  @xcite . the difference comes from the different assumptions on the nature of axions radiated from the axionic walls whether they are cold  @xcite or hot  @xcite .",
    "recent estimate of the axion energy density from axion walls by battye and shellard is dominated by the axionic string loops  @xcite , @xmath169\\left ( { f_a\\over 10^{12}\\ { \\rm gev}}\\right)^{1.18}\\ ] ] where @xmath170 is roughly denoting the loop creation size relative to the horizon size and @xmath171 is the back reaction decay rate . for @xmath172",
