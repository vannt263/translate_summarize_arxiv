    "the importance of investigations of globular clusters ( gcs ) has been reassessd in recent years ( ashman & zepf 1998 , kissler - patig 2000 ) , particularly since the globular cluster systems ( gcs ) of disk galaxies can be used to study the dynamical formation history of their host galaxies .",
    "the rapid dynamic formation scenario of our galaxy was first proposed by eggen , lynden - bell & sandage ( 1962 ; hereafter els ) based on apparent correlations among the kinematic properties and metallicity indicators of the halo and disk stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "previous studies interpreted the properties of the gcs in relation to the formation of our galaxy .",
    "maline , hartmann & mathews ( 1991 ) treated the gcs of the galaxy as a tracer of its chemical evolution and concluded that the galaxy was formed by an inhomogeneous collapse .",
    "kinman ( 1959 ) demonstrated that the gcs of our galaxy as a whole has a small net rotation and frenk & white ( 1980 ) suggested that the difference in rotational velocity between the f - type ( metal - poor ) and g - type ( metal - rich ) gc groups is only marginally significant in our galaxy .",
    "huchra et al .",
    "( 1982 ) also discovered a rotating system of m31 gcs .",
    "zinn ( 1993 ) pointed out that inner `` old halo '' clusters have rapid rotation , small velocity dispersion , and flattened orbits and suggested that these properties are evidence of the dissipational collapse formation of our galaxy .",
    "minniti ( 1996 ) studied the kinematics of gcs and stars in the galactic bulge and concluded that the metal - rich gcs and stars in the galactic bulge have similar kinematic properties to the inner `` old halo '' population ( cf .",
    "zinn 1993 ) and that the galactic bulge was formed by dissipational collapse .",
    "recently , chiba & beers ( 2000 ) discussed a new scenario for the formation of our galaxy from studying the proper motions of metal - poor halo stars in the solar neighborhood obtained by hipparcos .    in studying the global dynamic evolution of galaxies ,",
    "it is advantageous to use the kinematic properties of the gcss of those galaxies , because most gcs should have been formed before , during , or immediately after the collapse of their host galaxies ( fall & rees 1985 ) .",
    "those gcs , therefore , can give us information on the dynamic evolution that occurred during those epochs .",
    "we discuss the dynamic formation scenario of disk galaxies using the kinematic property of the gcs , especially the relation between metallicity and the ratio of the rotational velocity to the velocity dispersion .",
    "we construct simple models to simulate the evolution of the chemo - dynamic properties of the gcss of disk galaxies in section 2 and compare the observed properties of the gcss of our galaxy and m31 with those derived from these simple models in section 3 . in section 4 , we discuss the importance of observing gcss in s0 and sa type galaxies .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we try to recompile the gcs data of m81 and propose that the chemo - dynamic evolution of the m81 system may differ from those of the galaxy and m31 .",
    "we then conclude that we must investigate the detailed kinematics of the m81 gcs , because the quality and quantity of the data on m81 gcs is poor .",
    "in this section , we investigate the time variation of the rotational velocity of the collapsing protogalactic gas of the disk galaxy from which gcs were formed , and search for a relation between the metallicity @xmath3 and the normalized specific rotation @xmath4  of gcs , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the mean rotational velocity and the velocity dispersion of the gcs , respectively .    in order to make the dynamic models of disk galaxy formation treatable , we assume that the protogalaxies underwent homologous dynamic contraction along a family of self - consistent density - potential pair solutions of the poisson equation by conserving its angular momentum .",
    "the axisymmetric models adopted in this paper are those derived by miyamoto & nagai ( 1975 ) and their density @xmath7 and the gravitational potential @xmath8 are given by    @xmath9    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the total mass of the galactic disk and the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the time - dependent scale lengths along the r and z directions , respectively . solutions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) for the density - potential pair satisfy the poisson equation given by    @xmath14    for simplicity , we assume that @xmath15 at all times , which is acceptable for typical disk galaxies .",
    "the contraction profile of the protogalaxies is then expressed by the variation of the scale length @xmath12 as a function of time @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the total angular momentum @xmath17 of the protogalaxies is conserved during the collapse phase and its direction is perpendicular to the galactic disk .",
    "the expression for the total angular momentum is given by    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the rotation velocity parallel to the galactic disk and the projected surface density defined by    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the volume density of the galaxy .",
    "for practical calculation purposes , we adopt the radius @xmath23 and the half thickness @xmath24 .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath25 at these radius and half thickness defined by @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where the @xmath28 is the central mass density of a disk galaxy .    since",
    "a flat rotation curve is a typical property of disk galaxies , we assume that    @xmath29    this requires that when the density profile varies with the time - dependent scale radius @xmath12 , the angular momentum distribution is adjusted to make up the flat @xmath30 , whereas the total angular momentum of the galaxy is conserved",
    ".    the flat rotation velocity is then given by    @xmath31    where the moment of inertia @xmath32 is defined by    @xmath33    for simplification , in this paper , we assume that the spatial distribution , angular momentum , total energy , and flat property of the rotation curves of these gcs have been frozen and conserved since the time of gcs formation .",
    "furthermore , we assume that once gcs form in the collapsing protogalactic gas , they are disconnected from the collapsing gas system . if the kinematical energy of gcs were not conserved , the @xmath34 should be larger than that of conserved case for metal - poor clusters",
    ". however the @xmath35 also should be larger , so the effect of the dissipation for @xmath4  can be negligible .    under these assumptions ,",
    "the mean rotational velocity @xmath36 of gcs observed at present(@xmath37 ) would be equivalent to the mean rotational velocity @xmath38 during the formation of those gcs .",
    "the age - metallicity relation that translates @xmath16 to @xmath3 is discussed in section 2.3 .",
    "other velocity components @xmath39 and @xmath40 depend on @xmath36 and the present gravitational potential @xmath41 . if the disk galaxies are well virialized , those velocity components are given by    @xmath42    we then derive the formulation for the observational , normalized specific rotation @xmath4  of an disk galaxy from those three velocity components and the inclination @xmath43 of the disk projected onto the celestial sphere .",
    "by contrast , the observed @xmath4  of our galaxy is derived by assuming that the observer is at the solar radius ( see appendix ) .",
    "the parameters adopted in this paper are : the scale length @xmath44 of a typical disk galaxy at present is @xmath45kpc , hence @xmath46kpc ( e.g. helmi & white 1999 , patsis & grosbl 1996 ) , the initial(@xmath47 ) disk radius of a galaxy is @xmath48 ( e.g. , rees & ostriker 1977 ) , and the present flat rotation velocity is @xmath49 ( e.g. , rubin & ford 1970 , burton & gordon 1978 ) .      it is not straightforward to solve the time variation of the scale radius a(t ) of the gas self - consistently .",
    "instead , we adopt three models for describing the collapse profiles of protogalaxies for consideration .",
    "\\(1 ) exponential collapse : in this model , we assume that the scale size of the protogalaxy decreases exponentially with time , and that @xmath12 can be written in the form    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the timescale of collapse and @xmath53 is the initial size of the protogalaxy . of the three models , this represents a moderate collapse .",
    "\\(2 ) delayed collapse : in this model , the size of the protogalaxy decreases gradually with time initially and then , after some epoch , it decreases more rapidly with time . for our galaxy ,",
    "based on zinn(1993 ) , chiba & beers ( 2000 ) , this scenario assumes that the halo was built up by numerous fragments falling into the galaxy ( e.g. , searle & zinn 1978 ) and that at some time the halo collapsed rapidly ( e.g. , els ) .",
    "we assume that the slow collapse process was dominant until @xmath54 and that the rapid collapse process became dominant after @xmath54 , namely    @xmath55    where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the long and short time scales ( i.e. , @xmath58 ) , characterizing the two - stage collapse taking place before and after the transition epoch @xmath54 .",
    "\\(3 ) early collapse : in this model , the protogalaxy experiences a rapid initial collapse , followed by a slow collapse .",
    "the equation describing this collapse profile is the same as for the delayed collapse model ; however , the time scale of the first collapse , @xmath56 , is smaller than that of the second collapse , @xmath57 .",
    "although this model is not supported by theoretical or observational evidence , we examine this model as an extreme case , in contrast to the delayed collapse model .",
    "the collapse profiles describing the time variation of @xmath12 for the protogalaxy in these three collapse models are shown in figure 1 .",
    "this subsection discusses the temporal evolution of metallicity , that is , the so - called age metallicity relation ( amr ) of disk galaxies under the assumption that the metallicity of a gc traces the chemical evolution of the collapsing protogalaxy",
    ". the age of a galaxy is defined as the elapsed time from the start of the initial collapse of the galaxy .",
    "the initial mass function and rate of star formation are probably dependent on the density and pressure of the collapsing gas .",
    "therefore , the amr might well be modified according to the phase of star formation . for simplification",
    ", however , we assume that the amr is independent of the dynamic effect .",
    "we adopt a simple closed - box model for the chemical evolution of disk galaxies .",
    "this simple closed - box model is based on hartwick s ( 1976 ) concept , introduced as a simple model for the chemical evolution of the galactic halo .",
    "we assume that the gcs were formed from the collapsing gas and that the gcs conserve their initial chemical composition . under this assumption",
    ", the chemical abundance in gcs should reflect the chemical abundance in the collapsing halo gas during the formation of those gcs .",
    "this simple closed - box model adopts the schmidt law @xmath59 for the star formation rate , where @xmath60 is the gas fraction of the galaxy .",
    "the amr of a disk galaxy is obtained by coupling the basic equations for chemical evolution ( tinsley 1980 ) with the simple closed - box model .",
    "it is given by    @xmath61    or @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the metallicity of the solar neighborhood , @xmath16 is the age of the galaxy since the onset of the initial collapse , @xmath64 is the time scale of the active star formation period , and @xmath65 is the yield of newly created elements .",
    "these equations are quoted from arimoto , yoshii & takahara ( 1992 ) . for our galaxy ,",
    "the observation implies @xmath66 in the halo . in this work",
    ", we assume that nearby disk galaxies are the same age as the galaxy , so they have the same star formation rate as the galaxy .",
    "figure 1 shows the collapse profiles of the scale radius @xmath12 for the three models studied in this paper .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of the normalized specific rotation @xmath4  of the disk galaxy as a function of metallicity @xmath67 for each of the three collapse models for @xmath68 .",
    "the exponential and delayed collapse models both show rather an abrupt increase in @xmath4  at @xmath69 for @xmath70 and at @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "the epoch of this abrupt increase in @xmath4  depends directly on the value of @xmath64 . for the early collapse model ,",
    "@xmath4  increases gradually in contrast to the exponential and delayed collapse models .",
    "thus , we can discriminate between the early collapse model and the other two models in terms of the increase in @xmath4 .",
    "figure 3 shows a relation similar to that of figure 2 , but for @xmath73 .",
    "again , we see an abrupt increase in @xmath4  at some @xmath67 for the exponential and delayed collapse models . in these two models ,",
    "the abrupt increase in @xmath4  is a universal property in contrast to the early collapse model .",
    "therefore , we can easily see whether the early collapse model adequately describes the dynamic collapse history of disk galaxies , by examining the observed @xmath4  of the gcss in disk galaxies .    from figures 2 and 3 ,",
    "we conclude that when @xmath74 and @xmath75 or @xmath76 are fixed in a model , the profiles of the increase in @xmath4  are very similar .",
    "in summary ,    \\(1 ) the evolution of the normalized specific rotation as a function of the metallicity of gcs , described by the relation @xmath4 can be used as a diagnostic tool to identify the collapse history of the halos of disk galaxies .",
    "\\(2 ) when the schmidt law index @xmath74 is fixed , the @xmath3-dependence of the ratio of @xmath4  is sensitive to the ratio @xmath75 , but is insensitive to the individual value of @xmath52 or @xmath64 for a common ratio of @xmath75 .",
    "we now compare the observed kinematic properties of gcss with those predicted from the simple models discussed in section 2 .",
    "the data of the gcs of our galaxy , which are used to derive the @xmath0-metallicity relation  presented in this paper , are based on the most recent catalogue of harris ( 1996 ) . in this catalogue",
    ", only the heliocentric velocity @xmath78 is available .",
    "first , we correct @xmath78 to @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the velocity of the lsr about the galactic center , and @xmath81 and @xmath82 are galactic longitude and latitude , respectively .",
    "therefore , we regard the mean radial velocity as the rotational velocity . in order to derive it",
    ", we divide the galactic disk into two regions : one includes longitudes with @xmath83 and the other includes longitudes with @xmath84 .",
    "then , we calculate the mean of radial velocity for each of the regions , @xmath85 and @xmath86 and regard @xmath87 as @xmath88 .",
    "we use [ fe / h ] as an indicator of the metallicity @xmath3 .",
    "we adopt the `` _ running mean _ ''",
    "method to evaluate @xmath4  from a limited number of available samples , and hence are interested only in global properties of the derived @xmath4  .",
    "the general properties of the derived @xmath0-metallicity relation  of the gcs of our galaxy ( figure 4 ) are as follows :    \\(1 ) the gcs having @xmath89 } } < -1.0 $ ] show only a modest net rotation @xmath90 .",
    "\\(2 ) the rotational velocity of gcs increases rather abruptly from @xmath89 } } \\sim -1.0 $ ] to @xmath89 } } \\sim -0.7 $ ] .    in our galaxy ,",
    "the metallicity distribution of the gcs shows the presence of two distinct components ( zinn 1985 ) .",
    "this bimodality suggests that two different formation processes were involved .",
    "it appears that one of the populations was mixed with the other at [ fe / h]@xmath91 .",
    "therefore , the assumption that the gcs was formed from the collapsing proto - galaxy might not hold in that range of metallicity .",
    "this paper examines the chemical evolution of gcs that formed during the halo collapse phase with various collapse profiles , but it does not consider the deviation of the age - metallicity relation of the disk population of gcs from that of the halo population .",
    "our simple model reproduces the general increasing trend of @xmath4  with increasing [ fe / h ] , but the low values of @xmath4  were reproduced at @xmath92[fe / h]@xmath93 .",
    "this might be due to a major merging episode that took place during this epoch , since major merger events can increase @xmath94 temporally and decrease net @xmath95 to lower @xmath4  .",
    "m31 , the nearest spiral galaxy , has a similar mass ( @xmath96 ; rubin & frod 1970 ) and morphological type ( sb ;",
    "de vaucouleurs et al . 1991 ) to our galaxy , and is a natural test bed to apply our scheme for studying chemo - dynamic evolution using its gcs .",
    "we recompiled the most recent gcs catalogue of m31 ( barmby et al .",
    "2000 ) to derive @xmath0-metallicity relation .",
    "we regard the mean radial velocity as the rotational velocity . in order to derive it",
    ", we divide the m31 disk into two regions : one has a direction along with major - axis of m31 disk from center of m31 and the other has the other direction .",
    "then , we calculate the mean of radial velocity for each of the regions , @xmath85 and @xmath86 and regard @xmath87 as @xmath88 .    by adopting the inclination of m31 , @xmath97 ( e.g. , rubin & ford 1970 )",
    ", we derived figure 5 for m31 , in the same manner as figure 4 .",
    "the overall property of @xmath0-metallicity relation  for m31 is similar to that for our galaxy . by comparing the observed @xmath0-metallicity relations of the gcss of our galaxy and m31 with the results of the simple model discussed in section 2",
    ", we arrived at the following two conclusions :    \\(1 ) the contraction of the protogalaxy of m31 followed a collapse profile similar to all collapse models .",
    "\\(2 ) the ratio of the collapse time scale to the star formation time scale should have been @xmath98 for the galaxy , while it should be @xmath99 for m31 , when the power index of the schmidt law for star formation is @xmath100 .",
    "for @xmath101 , it should be @xmath102 for the galaxy and @xmath103 for m31 .",
    "however , we notice that @xmath104 may be unusual value for that ratio .",
    "the range of @xmath75 is derived considering uncertainties of our model and the observed @xmath0-metallicity relation , i.e. if a model line with a @xmath75 is covered error bars of metal - rich gcs data points , this @xmath75 is accepted .",
    "we regard the range of @xmath105[fe / h]@xmath106 and @xmath107[fe / h ] as metal - rich gcs data points for our galaxy and m31 , respectively . for our galaxy ,",
    "we leave the point of [ fe / h]@xmath108 out of consideration , because it should be unexpected point for our model .",
    "recently , the hierarchical clustering model has been discussed as a standard galactic formation model ( e.g. , katz & gunn 1991 ) .",
    "merger events probably played a considerable role in triggering gcs formation ( ashman & zepf 1992 ) .",
    "there is evidence that some elliptical galaxies have undergone mergers ( e.g. , zepf & ashman 1993 ) .",
    "zepf & ashman ( 1993 ) predicted that the gcss of some elliptical galaxies have two peaks in their metallicity distribution .",
    "our simple model assumes that galaxies were formed through the monolithic collapse of primordial gas .",
    "our dynamical model is compatible with a hierarchical clustering model , if the clustering gas clumps are numerous and have small scale .",
    "however , if the clustering of gas clumps involves a major merger event , our model may not adequately describe the dynamic and chemical evolution of such a system .",
    "by contrast , for those dissipationless merger events that did not trigger the formation of gcs , only the kinematics of gcs were affected .",
    "in fact , kissler - patig & gebhardt ( 1998 ) found evidence for dissipationless merger events in the globular clusters kinematics of m87 .",
    "some s0 and sa galaxies might also have undergone dissipationless merger events ( e.g. , jore , broeils & haynes 1996 , mihos , walker & hernquist 1995 ) .",
    "the occurrence of similar dissipationless merger events is conceivable in disk galaxies .",
    "if dissipationless merger events played a significant role in disk galaxies , @xmath0-metallicity relation  can not be predicted using the simple models introduced in section 2 . in other words , if the formation of the gcs is affected by dissipationless merging events , we will find that its kinematical properties are more complicated and will not show the rather simple relations observed in our galaxy and m31 ( cf . figures 4 and 5 ) .",
    "we need to investigate the relation between the kinematics and metallicity for the gcss of early - type disk galaxies to see the extent of the role of dissipationless merging events in the formation of gcss .",
    "elaborate observational studies of the gcss of disk galaxies have been carried out during the last decade .",
    "after the galaxy and m31 , the gcs of m81 is one of the most extensively observed ( georgiev et al .",
    "1992 , 1993 , perelmuter & racine 1995 , perelmuter , brodie & huchra 1995 ) .",
    "perelmuter , brodie & huchra ( 1995 ) published kinematical data of the gcs of m81 .",
    "even so , at present only 25 m81 gcs are available for the study of their chemo - dynamical properties .",
    "figure 6 shows the @xmath0-metallicity relation  for m81 , indicating a increasing @xmath4  at all [ fe / h ] similar to our galactic and m31 gcs .",
    "m81 likely underwent a significant interaction with m82 and ngc 3077 , the massive member galaxies of the m81 group .",
    "the evidence for such an interaction is the neutral hydrogen stream between those galaxies that has been confirmed by 21 cm hi emission studies ( van der hulst 1979 , yun et al .",
    "therefore , the kinematics of the m81 gcs might have been modified by tidal effects more conspicuously than in the galaxy or m31 .    at present , our study is limited by the paucity of available data on the gcs of m81 .",
    "since the expected number of gcs in m81 is more than 150 , we are planning an extensive study of the properties of the gcs of m81 to constrain the scenario of m81 formation .",
    "we made a series of chemo - dynamic model calculations to predict the relation for gcss under the assumption that gcss are formed before or during the collapse of protogalactic gas clouds .",
    "three collapse profiles , e.g. , exponential collapse , delayed collapse , and early collapse , are assumed in our simple models . the power index @xmath74 of the schmidt law for the star formation process , the dynamic collapse time scale @xmath52 , and the star formation time scale @xmath64 are the free parameters chosen in this study .",
    "we analyzed the @xmath0-metallicity relations of our galaxy ( figure 4 ) and m31 ( figure 5 ) .",
    "the observed relations for these two disk galaxies of similar mass and morphological type are similar .",
    "they exhibit a rather sudden increase in @xmath4  at [ fe / h]@xmath109 for the galaxy and at [ fe / h]@xmath110 for m31 .",
    "this is consistent with chemo - dynamic model predictions of the formation of the gcss of these galaxies .",
    "however we have to notice that it is difficult to choose the parameter set ( @xmath56,@xmath57 ) for fitting the model with data points for early collapse model .",
    "it also suggests that the gcss of these galaxies were formed in a dynamic collapse , where the collapse time scale is as large as , or larger than , the star formation time scale , if the star formation process is proportional to the protogalactic gas density , namely @xmath100 .",
    "the collapse time scale should be at least an order of magnitude larger than the star formation time scale , if the star formation process took place more efficiently in an enhanced density region , as is the case for @xmath101 .",
    "we noticed a difference in the [ fe / h ] value at which the abrupt increase of @xmath4  takes place between the galaxy and m31 . by comparing these observed curves with the results of simple models , we derived ratios of the collapse time scale to the star formation time scale for the galaxy and m31 of @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively , when the power index of the schmidt law for star formation is @xmath100 . for @xmath101 ,",
    "those ratios are @xmath104 .",
    "this might be a evidence that the @xmath101 model is ruled out , however we have to construct more realistic chemo - dynamical evolution model for discussing whether it is ruled out or not . these differences in the [ fe / h ] value",
    "do not reflect a significant differences in the @xmath75 .",
    "we suggest that the difference of the @xmath0-metallicity relation  between galaxies should be a probe for studying the differences of formation scenarios of those galaxies , although we can not restrict the formation scenario of a galaxy from it .    for the gcss of both our galaxy and m31",
    ", we see that the value of @xmath4  is @xmath111 at @xmath112[fe / h]@xmath113 , which is not consistent with the models .",
    "since we assumed that the protogalactic gas was monolithic in our models , @xmath4  may have been affected by merger events during the epoch that correspond to that metal range .",
    "gcs are useful probes for investigating the chemo - dynamic properties of host galaxies",
