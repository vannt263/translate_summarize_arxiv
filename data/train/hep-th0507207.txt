    "in a previous publication  @xcite , we have explained how to determine numerically the spectrum of the quantum neumann model .",
    "the neumann model describes a particle on a sphere subject to a quadratic potential .",
    "it has been introduced in the nineteenth century by neumann  @xcite , who showed that it is integrable .",
    "more recently , moser  @xcite and mumford  @xcite have shown how it fits in the modern approaches to algebraically integrable systems and generalized the model to any number of dimensions .",
    "more to our point , the quantum version of the model is also integrable  @xcite .",
    "this means that its solution reduces to the resolution of a one dimensional schrdinger equation , as it is the generic behaviour for algebraically integrable systems .",
    "the notable feature compared to the textbook examples is that the different conserved quantities , which all appear in the same equation , must be solved for simultaneously .",
    "this is a non trivial problem which has been attacked in  @xcite .",
    "we will precise and prove some statements made in this paper .",
    "moreover , the neumann model is related with stckel systems as noted by gurarie and fully developed recently in  @xcite",
    ".    we will start with a brief presentation of the model and the equations which have to be solved .",
    "the physics of the model is driven by a general scale parameter  @xmath0 , which is proportional both to the strength of the interaction and the radius of the sphere .",
    "small values of @xmath0 correspond to a quantum regime and are next studied by perturbation theory .",
    "then , we introduce the semi  classical analysis which is appropriate for large values of @xmath0 .",
    "the comparison of energy levels obtained by semi  classical methods and by the numerical solution of the schrdinger equation shows that it is indeed the case .",
    "however , we find a small constant discrepancy between the two . in a last part , we recover this constant by analytic studies of the model at large @xmath0 according to these two methods .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given in terms of angular momenta @xmath1 : @xmath2 with the constraint @xmath3 .",
    "we assume @xmath4 . one can always shift all the @xmath5 by a constant since this merely adds a constant to @xmath6 .",
    "the system is classically and quantum mechanically integrable since the following quantities commute , classically and quantically : @xmath7    to solve the equations of motions , one introduces the  separated \" variables @xmath8 given as the roots of : @xmath9 positivity of @xmath10 implies that there is exactly one root in each interval @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "it has been shown in  @xcite that finding the common eigenvector for the @xmath12 with eigenvalue @xmath13 reduces to solving the unique one  dimensional schrdinger equation : @xmath14\\,\\psi(t)=0 \\label{lame}\\ ] ] this is a linear differential equation with singularities at the @xmath5 and at infinity .",
    "the situation is explained in more details in  @xcite .",
    "it can be useful to write the potential term in the form : @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "classically the action @xmath17 satisfies the separated hamilton - jacobi equation : @xmath18 in figure  1 we draw the different possibilities for the potential in the neumann case @xmath19 , with oscillator strengths 0 , 1 and @xmath20 .    , with @xmath21.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] [ figs ]    for @xmath0 large",

    "one goes from case d ) to case a ) either through the cases b ) or c ) . in case",
    "b ) , @xmath22 and @xmath23 both belong to the interval @xmath30 $ ] so that the allowed region corresponds to @xmath31 and @xmath32 describes the whole interval @xmath33 $ ] . in case c ) and d ) , @xmath22 is negative and @xmath23 is on either side of 1 .",
    "one of the @xmath8 describes the whole interval and the other is constrained away from 1 by @xmath23 .",
    "it is easy to check that no other configuration is compatible with the existence of @xmath34 and @xmath35 satisfying @xmath36 in the appropriate intervals . in the general case , we will show in the sequel that all the @xmath37 are real and belong to the interval @xmath38 $ ] , with @xmath39 supposed to be @xmath40 .",
    "there is therefore a total of @xmath41 possibilities for the relative positions of the @xmath37 and @xmath5 .    at @xmath42 ,",
    "the system reduces to a free particle on the sphere .",
    "the energy levels are given by the usual formula @xmath43 for spherical harmonics , but with a different choice of basis in the @xmath44-dimensional eigenspace .",
    "these basic functions are called spheroidal harmonics .",
    "these harmonics diagonalize the perturbation by the potential , so that energy levels separate linearly for small @xmath0 .    for large @xmath0 ,",
    "the potential term becomes dominant and the point is restricted to the vicinity of the two opposite poles @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 . in the next approximation , we can neglect the curvature of the sphere and we have two independent harmonic oscillators in @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the configuration around the two poles are linked by an exponentially small tunnelling amplitude , so that all states come in almost degenerate pairs .",
    "in the case @xmath42 , the singularity at infinity of the equation  ( [ lame ] ) becomes regular .",
    "even if the behaviour of the solution at infinity has no direct bearing on the physical wave function , it appears important for the characterization of the solutions and provides the quantization condition for the energy .",
    "indeed , recall that around a regular singularity at @xmath50 , a second order differential equation has two independent solutions of the form @xmath51 , with the exponents @xmath52 roots of a second order equation . at the finite singularities",
    "@xmath5 , the exponents are 0 and @xmath53 with respective monodromies @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we determined that to produce a single valued wave function on the sphere , the solutions must be of definite monodromy at each of the points @xmath5 .",
    "monodromy at infinity is the product of the monodromies at the @xmath5 and is therefore @xmath56 .",
    "since the exponent at infinity is solution of : @xmath57 and @xmath52 must be integer or half integer to get the right monodromy , we conclude that the energy @xmath58 is @xmath59 with any non negative integer @xmath60 .    for a given energy @xmath58",
    ", there is a second root @xmath52 which yields a solution vanishing at infinity",
    ". however it can not be the solution we are seeking with diagonal monodromy at the @xmath5 , since such a solution would be single valued and regular on a compact riemann surface . in the case where all monodromies are one , the solution has just one singularity , a pole at infinity and is therefore a polynomial of degree @xmath52 .",
    "these functions are known as spheroidal harmonics of first species  @xcite .    in order to find these polynomial solutions ,",
    "we write them in the form @xmath61 . inserting in equation  ( [ lame ] ) ,",
    "we get : @xmath62 as it should be , this equation requires that @xmath63 and we recover the value for the energy from the dominant term at @xmath64 .",
    "this equation is equivalent to the condition that its residues at the @xmath5 and @xmath65 all vanish .",
    "the residues at the @xmath65 give a system of non - linear equations which determine the @xmath65 : @xmath66 the residues at the @xmath5 then determine the conserved quantities as : @xmath67 the system of equations  ( [ eqzero ] ) can be seen as the condition of equilibrium of a system of points with logarithmic repulsive potentials , some of which being fixed . in this formulation , it is therefore clear that there is a unique solution with a definite number of @xmath65 in each of the intervals @xmath11 $ ] . in the case",
    "@xmath19 , this gives @xmath68 different solutions of degree @xmath69 .",
    "similar calculations can be done for solutions which are of the form @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a subset of the singularities .",
    "this gives spheroidal harmonics of the second , third and fourth species  @xcite for @xmath19 .",
    "the total number of these harmonics with energy @xmath72 is exactly @xmath73 , the known degeneracy of this energy level .",
    "numerical solutions of the system of equations  ( [ eqzero ] ) are easy to get by a multidimensional newton method and have been used to produce initial solutions in our previous paper .    from the knowledge of this @xmath42 solutions",
    ", we will describe the behaviour of the solutions for small @xmath0 .",
    "as soon as @xmath0 is different from zero , the solution gets an essential singularity at infinity .",
    "we therefore multiply the spheroidal harmonic by the simplest function singular at infinity , namely @xmath74 . in the vicinity of @xmath42",
    ", we expect @xmath75 to be small and neglect higher powers of @xmath75 . inserting in equation  ( [ lame ] ) gives : @xmath76 the term proportional to @xmath77 in this equation immediately gives that @xmath75 is proportional to @xmath0 , so that the hypothesis that @xmath75 is small is valid .",
    "@xmath78 here @xmath79 is the degree of the polynomial .",
    "the roots @xmath65 of the wave function satisfy equations which are small perturbations of equation  ( [ eqzero ] ) , hence are close to their values for @xmath42 .",
    "the term in @xmath80 then gives the perturbation of the energy : @xmath81 similar calculations can be done for the spheroidal harmonics of the other species and this nicely reproduces the slopes of the numerical results at small @xmath0 .",
    "as an integrable system , the neumann model lends itself to a simple semiclassical analysis writing basically that the bohr  sommerfeld conditions quantize the liouville tori .",
    "equivalently , the separated schrdinger equation can be analyzed by the wkb method .",
    "the presence of a singular factor in the first derivative term of the equation  ( [ lame ] ) seems to be a problem for the application of the wkb method in our case , but we will show that in contrast to what happens in the spherical symmetry case  @xcite , this does not cause troubles . in a first approach ,",
    "we write an expansion in powers of @xmath82 for the action @xmath17 such that @xmath83 : @xmath84 as usual the dominant term in @xmath85 does not depend on the first derivative term in the equation and gives for @xmath86 : @xmath87 the following term gives : @xmath88 due to the form of @xmath86 , the singular terms at @xmath5 cancel and one gets : @xmath89 at this order , the wave function is regular at the @xmath5 and one can also show that the following correction to @xmath17 is regular at @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast , the first correction is mildly singular at the turning point @xmath90 and the following correction @xmath91 has so bad singularities that the expansion breaks down . in the cases where the @xmath90 are away from the @xmath5 , the usual connection formulae around the turning point  @xcite justify an additional @xmath92 phase factor in the quantization conditions .",
    "another approach is to desingularize the equation  ( [ lame ] ) by introducing a new variable @xmath93 defined by the ( hyper-)elliptic integral  @xcite : @xmath94 the application of the chain rule gives : @xmath95 so that the schrdinger equation becomes : @xmath96 this equation has neither singularities nor first derivative term , so that the usual wkb formula gives : @xmath97 it should be emphasized that the variation of @xmath93 is alternatively real and purely imaginary when @xmath98 crosses the @xmath5 , introducing additional @xmath99 factors in the action . in the traditional @xmath19 case",
    ", @xmath93 is an elliptic integral and @xmath98 can be expressed with weierstra  elliptic functions .",
    "when @xmath98 goes from @xmath40 to @xmath100 , @xmath93 describes the boundary of the half  periods rectangle . in the cases where there are more singularities",
    ", it is possible that the @xmath98 variable is not well defined as an inverse function of @xmath93 , however this is of no consequence for the study of the schrdinger equation which proceeds separately on each of the intervals @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "the above elliptic formulation allows to demonstrate quickly the claim we have made that there must be in each interval @xmath101 $ ] a region where the product @xmath102 takes negative values .",
    "recall from  @xcite that the wave function is either even or odd under each parity operation @xmath103 . in terms of the @xmath98 variable ,",
    "this translates into monodromy around @xmath5 .",
    "now , the @xmath93 variable of the elliptic parametrization behaves as @xmath104 in the vicinity of @xmath5 so that the wave function is even or odd as a function of @xmath105 , which means that either @xmath106 or its derivative vanishes at each of the @xmath107 .",
    "multiplying eq .",
    "( [ ellequ ] ) by @xmath106 and integrating by parts , we then get for each @xmath108 : @xmath109 dx = 0\\ ] ] under the elliptic parametrization , the image of the real axis is a sequence of alternatively real and purely imaginary intervals , according to the sign of the product @xmath110 .",
    "the @xmath111 term has therefore the same sign as this product . since @xmath106 is real , eq .",
    "( [ ene ] ) can not be satisfied if the potential remains of the same sign as the kinetic term .",
    "this is equivalent to the condition @xmath36 at some point of the interval @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "finally , we prove that this allows to establish that quantum mechanically the @xmath112 obey the constraints we have discussed in the framework of the classical analysis .    the relative position of the @xmath5 and @xmath112 depends on the signs of the @xmath13 .",
    "the only one with a fixed sign is @xmath113 , which is positive .",
    "all combinations of the signs of the other ones are possible , which gives @xmath41 possibilities .",
    "we will show that each of these sign combinations corresponds to a unique set of relative positions of the @xmath112 .",
    "the fact that we identify @xmath114 necessary real zeroes of the potential shows that all @xmath112 must be real .",
    "more precisely , we will show that @xmath112 belongs to the interval @xmath115a_j , a_{j+1}[$ ] if @xmath116 is positive and to the interval @xmath115a_{j-1},a_{j}[$ ] otherwise .",
    "this means that we have to show that in the interval @xmath115a_j , a_{j+1}[$ ] , there is exactly one zero if @xmath116 and @xmath117 are of the same sign and two if @xmath116 is positive and @xmath117 is negative .",
    "if the @xmath118 are of the same sign , the potential reaches opposite infinite limits at the ends of the interval , so that it must have a zero in between . in the other case",
    ", the potential goes to positive infinity at the two ends of the interval and we proved that the potential must be negative somewhere in the interval .",
    "this is only possible if the potential has two zeroes which we identify as @xmath112 and @xmath119 .",
    "the only remaining thing to prove is that there is a zero in the interval @xmath115-\\infty , a_1[$ ] when @xmath120 is negative . in this case , we use the fact that @xmath121 is positive , so that the dominant term near @xmath40 is negative .",
    "the potential is positive at @xmath122 hence there must be a zero in between . since we identified @xmath114 zeroes , we have exhausted the whole set of zeroes for the potential and there can not be any other , proving in particular that all zeroes are real .      in fact , using any of the two wkb approaches , we get the same semiclassical quantization conditions : @xmath123 in the case where all the monodromies are one and @xmath112 is in the interval @xmath101 $ ] . the integer @xmath124 is the number of zeroes of the wave function in the interval @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "if the monodromy around @xmath125 is @xmath55 , we should add one half to @xmath124 .",
    "in the cases where @xmath112 is near @xmath126 or becomes smaller , the @xmath92 phase factor is no more a good approximation and we will postpone to further studies the relevant phase factors .",
    "this equation has already appeared in the literature , for example in  @xcite , where the refinement with the @xmath92 phase first appears in the last paper .",
    "it is introduced there using the machinery of maslov indices . in this case , the justification through the connection formulae is very direct , it simply uses the linear approximation of the potential around the turning point and consequently the asymptotic analysis of the airy function:@xmath127    .[ener1],width=566 ]    .[ener2],width=566 ]    in order to compare the semiclassical predictions to the exact numerical solutions found in  @xcite , we solve numerically the quantization conditions  ( [ semi ] ) and plot the resulting expression for the energy as a function of @xmath0 compared with two exact energy levels which are degenerate in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "we do this for a small number of energy levels in order to keep the graphs uncluttered and plot them for oscillator strengths equal to @xmath128 in fig .  2 and @xmath129 in fig .  2 , both in the case @xmath19",
    "in either figure , the three heavy lines are the wkb predictions .",
    "we see that the small @xmath0 regime is poorly accounted for , which is of no surprise since in this case , we are no longer in the situation a ) of fig",
    ".  1 and their should be phase corrections different from @xmath92 and moreover , we are in the deep quantum regime , where we do not expect wkb approximation to be good .",
    "nevertheless , we plan to study in further works the different cases of fig .  1 and the transitions between them .    the most notable feature of the curves plotted in fig .",
    "2 and  3 is that in the large @xmath0 limit , there is a small constant separation between the exact and wkb curves .",
    "this separation is independent both on the energy level and the oscillator strengths .",
    "this contradicts the naive expectation that the corrections to the wkb approximation are of order @xmath130 with respect to the order zero solution which has an energy of order @xmath131 .",
    "this order of the correction is true for the solution away from the turning points , but the difference from the airy function may create order @xmath82 correction to the phase as noted in  @xcite .",
    "it is however remarkable that this finite correction to the energy does not depend on the level , so that the transition energies have vanishing errors in the small @xmath82 regime .",
    "it is the purpose of the following section to show through perturbative computations the validity of this result .",
    "we first compute perturbatively for large @xmath0 or equivalently small @xmath82 the energy levels as obtained from the `` enhanced '' bohr  sommerfeld rules , and then as perturbations of quantum oscillators sitting around the pole of the sphere .",
    "we limit ourselves to the @xmath19 case and we fix the oscillator strengths to @xmath132 as in  @xcite . since @xmath0 is large , the point on the sphere is limited to the vicinity of the points @xmath133 , whose separated variables are @xmath134 and @xmath135 . with @xmath22 close to 1 and @xmath23 close to @xmath20 ,",
    "@xmath34 is classically limited to the interval @xmath136 $ ] and @xmath35 to the interval @xmath137 $ ] , which limits the point to the vicinity of the pole . to do our perturbative calculations , we will write @xmath138 and @xmath139 , so that @xmath52 and @xmath140 are small .",
    "the integrand in the bohr ",
    "sommerfeld rules takes the form : @xmath141 when integrating in @xmath136 $ ] , we can not expand the factors @xmath142 and @xmath143 , but all the others can be expanded around @xmath144 and in powers of @xmath140 .",
    "the resulting integrals are easily computable yielding : @xmath145 similarly for the integral in @xmath137 $ ] we keep the factors @xmath146 and @xmath147 and expand the others around @xmath148 in powers of @xmath52 .",
    "we then get the integral : @xmath149 we write that the first integral is equal to @xmath150 and similarly the second equal to @xmath151 which determines @xmath52 and @xmath140 : @xmath152 note that this justifies a posteriori the claim we made that @xmath52 and @xmath140 are small , and become smaller when @xmath0 increases .",
    "finally the energy @xmath153 takes the simple form , in which there is no mixing between @xmath154 and @xmath155 excitations : @xmath156 of course the first term corresponds to the energy of two independent harmonic oscillators of respective excitations @xmath154 and @xmath155 , and nicely fits the @xmath157 look of the energy levels at large @xmath0 apparent in the figures of  @xcite . the second and third term shift these square root terms towards their correct position , but miss it by a small constant . as we show below this small constant is accessible to a more correct quantum computation .",
    "the principle of this calculation is to work out a perturbation of harmonic oscillators .",
    "we detail it in the case @xmath19 and it is then convenient to go to the elliptic parametrization given by eq .",
    "( [ ellparam ] ) .",
    "we expand the change of variable in the vicinity of @xmath144 and @xmath148 .",
    "taking the origin in @xmath148 , we write @xmath158 which can be inverted to yield @xmath159 a similar computation gives the parametrization around @xmath144 @xmath160 these values of the variable @xmath98 will be used in the schrdinger equation  ( [ ellequ ] ) to express in terms of the variable @xmath93 the potential @xmath161 .",
    "the sign can change since in the calculation of @xmath93 , we forgot the imaginary unit @xmath99 which can appear according to the sign of the term under the square root .    in the large @xmath0 limit , @xmath22 is near @xmath162 and @xmath23 is near @xmath20 and the lowest relevant order for the potential for @xmath98 around @xmath20 is : @xmath163 which is the potential for a harmonic oscillator with energy @xmath164 and oscillator strength @xmath165 .",
    "this gives @xmath166 , which is exactly the semiclassical result at this order .",
    "similarly , @xmath167 . in order to choose the terms which will contribute to the next order , we should remember that for the harmonic oscillator , @xmath168 is of order @xmath169 .",
    "we therefore get corrections stemming from the variation of the oscillator strength , from the factor in front of @xmath170 and from anharmonic terms in @xmath171 which stem in part from the one in @xmath172 and in part from the product of the two @xmath168 terms occurring in both factors @xmath173 .",
    "the order one corrected potential is : @xmath174 with the anharmonic oscillator schrdinger equation written as @xmath175 , first order perturbation theory yields the energy levels @xmath176 .",
    "this result is easily obtained writing @xmath171 in terms of creation and annihilation operators . putting these corrections together ,",
    "we get : @xmath177 note that this only differs from the semiclassical result by the last term , independent on the @xmath178 .    a similar computation yields the potential developed around @xmath144 and the first order correction to the energy of the corresponding anharmonic oscillator gives @xmath179 whatever happens outside of these two regions",
    "is exponentially suppressed for large @xmath0 , since the wave function of the harmonic oscillator are already exponentially small there . combining the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    ", we obtain for the energy at this order in @xmath180 a result which differs from the semiclassical one of eq .",
    "( [ niveausc ] ) only by a constant @xmath181 this nicely reflects our findings on figs .  2 and  3 where @xmath182 .",
    "the interaction of the study of the neumann model and the generalized lam equation allowed us to give precise results on the behaviour of the spectrum in some limits .",
    "the generalized lam equation has independent interest since it is the most general linear differential equation of second order with only regular singularities at finite distance .",
    "we were able to precisely count the different cases for the positions of the zeroes of the potential , showing in particular that they are all real .",
    "it is also remarkable that there is a constant error in the wkb approximation .",
    "this error is however independent on the level , so that it does not appear in transition energies . in this integrable case",
    ", the wkb approximation gives pretty good results even for low excitation numbers and the further study of its behaviour around turning points at low energy could make it even more useful ."
