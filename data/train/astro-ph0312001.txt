    "dark matter ( dm ) has proved to be an essential component of the self  consistent cosmological framework , within which observations on a wide range of cosmic scales are generally interpreted . despite its pervasive role ,",
    "however , its nature is still elusive and its properties mostly speculative . in an attempt to gain insight of its fundamental characteristics , and motivated by the apparent conflicts faced by cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenarios when compared with observations on small cosmological scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have recently hypothesized that the gravitational attraction between dm and baryons may be suppressed on the kpc scale ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper i ) . the gravitational suppression ( gras )",
    "hypothesis was suggested by the simple observation that all the various inconsistencies between theory and observations appear to be characterized by a common physical length .",
    "gras minimally modifies the existing paradigm , i.e. it does not alter large  scale interactions or baryon and dm self  dynamics .    in paper i we modeled the effective force acting between visible and dark particles by adding a short  range yukawa contribution to the standard newtonian potential .",
    "we also investigated the consistency and universality of such an empirical gravitational paradigm , fixing the model parameters using observations of the rotation curves of low surface brightness ( lsb ) , gas  rich galaxies , the cores of which are thought to be dm  dominated .",
    "the scale length @xmath0 over which the yukawa contribution is effective is about one kpc , and its strength on small distances is equal and opposite to the newtonian one . in other words ,",
    "the inner dynamics of lsb galaxies seems to point towards a `` total suppression '' scenario , whereby dm is completely oblivious of normal matter in its immediate vicinity .",
    "the analysis of paper i was mainly concerned with rotationally supported disk galaxies having circular velocity of order @xmath1 km / s . here",
    ", we investigate consequences and predictions of the proposed gravity model on a class of systems having different matter distributions and dynamical symmetries , with characteristic velocities nearly a factor 10 smaller than those of typical lsb galaxies .",
    "in particular we aim :    \\a ) to assess the ability of the model in describing the kinematics of dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies , i.e. in a physical regime of spherically symmetric , pressure - supported , low - velocity , virialized systems .",
    "this study is motivated by recent claims ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) according to which a universal navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 , nfw ) dm profile can reproduce the shape of the velocity dispersion profiles of dsph galaxies only if a substantial ( and poorly justified ) amount of tangential anisotropy in the velocity distribution of dsph stars is assumed . by confronting kinematical data of dsph galaxies with the gras predictions ,",
    "we wish to verify whether the latter achieves the same interpretative success as with lsb galaxies    \\b ) to check the ability of gras in describing both kinematics and space distribution of stars perpendicular to the galactic disk in the vicinity of the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the presence of a spheroidal , non baryonic , dm halo embedding the thin galactic disk affects the density distribution of stars near the galactic plane @xcite , it is imperative to quantify the dynamical effects on stellar motions which are the consequence of gras .",
    "it has been noted @xcite that an intrinsically different non - newtonian theory ( modified newtonian dynamic : mond , by milgrom 1983 ) , while capable of explaining the flat rotation curves of galaxies without requiring the presence of a dark matter halo , leads to inconsistent predictions on the vertical component of the gravitational acceleration experienced by solar neighborhood disk stars .",
    "does gras score any better ?",
    "as in paper i , we model the proposed short - range modification of gravity by adding to the standard newtonian potential a repulsive yukawa contribution which is active only in the mixed ( dark  visible ) sector .",
    "we can then write the total gravitational potential acting on baryons as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 satisfies the usual poisson equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the baryonic and dm densities .",
    "the yukawa contribution @xmath7 typically dies out exponentially with a radial scale length @xmath0 , according to @xmath8 notice that @xmath9 is sourced by the dm energy density only .",
    "the resulting gravitational potential between a dm and a baryonic particle at a distance @xmath10 from each other goes like @xmath11 . in what follows",
    "we assume @xmath12 kpc as suggested by the study of lsb galaxies in paper i.",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies , being small and dm dominated , provide a test for the validity of gras in a low - velocity , shallow potential regime . since the typical luminous dimension of a dsph is @xmath13 kpc , its baryonic dynamics is expected to be strongly influenced by the specific form of our gravitational potential , which is significantly dampened with respect to the pure newtonian one on these scales .",
    "thus : given a realistic dm density profile , is the baryon dynamics derived within the gras paradigm in agreement with the observations of the stellar velocity dispersion in dsph galaxies ?",
    "the stellar radial velocity dispersion profile @xmath14 induced by the total potential @xmath15 can be obtained by solving the jeans equation for a pressure supported spherical system @xmath16 where @xmath17 accounts for the anisotropy in the stellar velocity field .",
    "the luminous component of a dsph galaxy is well described by the srsic profile @xcite @xmath18\\ ] ] with exponential index @xmath13 ( but see caldwell 1999 ) where @xmath19 is the surface brightness .",
    "the baryonic energy density @xmath20 can be obtained from @xmath19 by deprojection : @xmath21 ( see @xcite for an explicit analytical solution of this integral ) where @xmath22 is the baryonic mass - to - light ratio . to first approximation , @xmath22 is independent on the radius for the objects considered .",
    "the solution can be applied to equation and in the inversion of equation to obtain @xmath3 .",
    "the dm component @xmath6 is also needed , as it contributes to both the newtonian and the yukawa potentials .",
    "we describe @xmath6 via a generalized nfw profile of inner slope index @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the critical density of the universe , @xmath26 is a characteristic overdensity and @xmath27 a radial scale parameter .",
    "according to n - body simulations , @xmath28 @xcite and @xmath29 @xcite bracket the plausible range of variation of this parameter @xcite .",
    "the virial radius @xmath30 of an object is that within which the mean density is @xmath31 kpc .",
    "the radius @xmath27 marks the transition from the outer @xmath32 to the inner @xmath33 density behavior .",
    "a concentration parameter for the dm halo @xmath34 can be defined , which in n  body simulations exhibits a mild dependence on the total mass of the halo .",
    "we have not found explicit results for objects of masses @xmath35 , so we extrapolate the results of @xcite to small masses and use , for the nfw @xmath36 case , the formula @xmath37 while , for the steeper profile @xmath29 we set @xmath38 @xcite .    equation in the case of spherical symmetry reduces to @xmath39 and in paper i an integral expression for @xmath9 in terms of @xmath40 was outlined .",
    "however , for generic @xmath41 only numerical solutions of can be found , while the solution of the poisson equation can always be given in closed analytic form for any value of @xmath23 .",
    "once the total potential @xmath15 is obtained , equation can be solved for the radial velocity dispersion .",
    "a more useful quantity is the line - of sight velocity dispersion @xmath42 , which is related to @xmath43 through @xcite @xmath44 and provides a direct comparison with observations .",
    "spatially resolved kinematic data became recently available for two dsph galaxies : fornax ( mateo 1997 ) and draco ( kleyna 2002 ) . under the assumption that these galaxies are in dynamical equilibrium , as found by @xcite ) , we can compare the observed velocity dispersions with those predicted by gras .",
    "assuming that the measurement errors of the dsph velocity profiles are normally distributed ( possible systematics such as the influence of binary populations are negligible as shown for example by @xcite ) , we compare the observations of @xmath42 with equation ( 9 ) and constrain the scale parameters of the dm density profile via least square minimization .",
    "we also fix the parameters characterizing the stellar distribution ( i.e. the baryons properties ) as given by the observations , as shown in table 1 .",
    "numerical minimization is performed assuming as free parameters of the model the virial mass @xmath45 of the dark halo embedding the dsph and the velocity anisotropy parameter @xmath46 which , for simplicity , is assumed to be independent of the radial scale .",
    "thus , our results do not rely on any _ a - priori _ assumed anisotropic model : the velocity anisotropy is self - consistently evaluated by our fitting scheme .",
    "the resulting best fitting values are presented in table 2 .",
    "our results may be described as follow :    \\a ) the predicted gras gravitational acceleration generated by a two component fluid of baryons ( distributed according to the sersic profile ) and dm ( distributed according to the generalized nfw profile ) is in agreement with the stellar velocity dispersions observed in the dsph galaxies fornax and draco , if the stellar orbits are isotropic as shown in figs . 1 and 2    \\b ) the best fitting velocity anisotropy parameter @xmath47 derived within the gras gravitational paradigm is consistent with the results of n - body simulations of dm halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "table 2 shows that a newtonian analysis of the kinematics within a cuspy , nfw dm profile agrees with the observations only if the existence of a strong tangential anisotropy in the dsph stellar orbits is assumed ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the amount of tangential anisotropy needed to fit the profiles is , however , unphysically large if confronted with observations of stars in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the evidence that elliptical galaxies are moderately , radially anisotropic ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )    \\c ) the best fitting mass within the virial radius depends on the assumed concentration parameter ( eq .",
    "7 ) . for realistic values of @xmath48 , and for all gravity models",
    ", the mass of fornax and draco is larger than commonly assumed ( see @xcite for a similar conclusion ) .",
    "since in pressure supported systems there is a well known degeneracy of density profiles versus velocity anisotropy @xcite , the best fitting masses present a non negligible degree of covariance with respect to the best @xmath46 estimate . the more negative the @xmath46 parameter ( as in the newtonian case ) , the bigger is the inferred mass ( see table 2 ) .",
    "moreover , the steeper the cusp of the profile ( higher @xmath23 ) , the more tangential is the velocity distribution required to fit the data , in agreement with the finding of @xcite .",
    "we also note that our results for m@xmath49/l@xmath50 ( the mass - to - light ratio inside the dsph tidal radius @xmath51 ) agree in order of magnitude with other independent estimates based on newtonian analysis ( e.g. , kleyna et al .",
    "( 2001,2002 ) ; @xcite )    \\d ) dsph galaxies have low densities and therefore they lie in the regime of small accelerations for which mond provides an alternative interpretation of the observed kinematics , without reliance on the dm hypothesis .",
    "however , lokas ( 2001 ) and kleyna et al . ( 2001 ) found that the best fitting values of @xmath52 , the characteristic acceleration scale ( a@xmath53 cm s@xmath54 ) below which the laws of newtonian dynamics change , are different for different dsph ( low for fornax , much higher than expected in the case of draco ) .",
    "they concluded that the draco poses a serious problem for mond . at variance , the gras parameters are stable and robust even in the case of these two systems which have similar velocity dispersion but very different luminosities .",
    "we next test gras predictions in the sub - kiloparsec , small velocity regime of stellar kinematics in the direction @xmath55 perpendicular to the galactic disk . in the vicinity of the disk",
    "the gravitational potential can be locally described by @xcite @xmath56 in what follows , derivations with respect to @xmath55 and @xmath10 are meant while keeping the other coordinates  cylindrical and spherical respectively  fixed .",
    "moreover , equation is derived under the assumption that the rotation curve is flat ( @xmath57 ) which is , to a good approximation , a valid assumption at our position in the galactic disk .",
    "we also note that in the solar neighborhood the halo density is about one tenth of the disk baryonic density @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the halo effects on the nearby stellar dynamics can be treated as a perturbation , approximated by expanding in @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a single isothermal population of density @xmath59 with velocity dispersion @xmath60 is then described by the first moment of the boltzmann equation @xmath61 .",
    "we next estimate the correction terms introduced by gras into eq . .",
    "note that , since @xmath9 is spherically symmetric , @xmath62 where the height from the disk @xmath55 is small with respect to our distance @xmath10 from the center of the galaxy . in order to estimate the first term on the right hand side of we use equation .",
    "since the distance of the sun from the center of the galaxy is about 8.5 kpc , we expand the solution in the @xmath63 limit to obtain @xmath64 .\\ ] ] deviations from the newtonian equation are therefore expected at order @xmath65 in the halo density contribution .",
    "for instance , in the isothermal approximation @xmath66 , we obtain @xmath67 .\\ ] ] at the sun s location , the correction to the bahcall parameter @xmath68 is thus negligible and of order @xmath69 .",
    "we conclude that gras is fully compatible and does not compromise our current understanding of the kinematics in the solar neighborhood .",
