    "in the last four years , observations by using integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) of individual star - forming galaxies have revealed that galaxies at @xmath5 show a large variety of kinematic and dynamical properties .",
    "recent studies at @xmath6 have confirmed that in addition of the evidence of organized rotation non - negligible random motions are also detected at this redshift .",
    "in addition , it appears that large and massive disks with strong star formation already exist at @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however more numerous studies at @xmath7 have found an increase in non - circular motions relatives to lower redshift samples .",
    "indeed most of these high - redshift galaxies have high velocity dispersions .",
    "even when a large - scale velocity gradient throughout the galaxy is detected , the value of the ratio of @xmath8 is relatively low ( @xmath9 ) suggesting that it is unlikely for these galaxies to have a dynamically cold rotating disk of ionised gas similar to the local spiral galaxies ( @xmath10 @xcite ) .",
    "most of these ` heated disks ' appear also to be extremely rich in gas with evidence of high turbulent star formation@xcite .",
    "another significant difference in the properties of some of these high - redshift objects in comparison to the local universe is the increase in the irregular and asymmetric shape of these galaxies .",
    "although some of these irregular objects may be associated with mergers , the morphology and kinematics of the majority of them are incompatible with being ongoing mergers @xcite and suggest that they are rotationally supported @xcite .",
    "these so - called ` chain - galaxies ' have the appearance of giant highly clumpy disks .",
    "the objects can be kpc wide and as massive as @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "@xcite was the first to suggest that they could be the progenitor of @xmath12 spirals .",
    "although the origin of the ` heated disks ' remains uncertain and highly debated , recent theoretical studies @xcite propose a bimodality in galaxy type by @xmath13 with clumpy star - forming disks and spheroid - dominated galaxies with low star formation rates ( sfrs ) . at @xmath14 ,",
    "the disks should be stabilized by the dominant stellar disks and bulges , suggested that the redshift region of @xmath15 is a crucial step in the formation of massive disk galaxies .",
    "nowadays theoretical studies try to understand the formation and evolution of extended turbulent rotating disks , and observational studies , as the ones presented in this paper , probing the kinematics properties ( like observed morphology , dynamical mass , etc ) , the stellar population properties ( age of the population , stellar masses , etc ) , star forming rates , and the properties of the ionized gas ( mass de gas and gas fraction ) of the @xmath15 disks are mandatory for setting constrains on galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the columns are as follows : ( 1 ) redshift estimated from optical spectrum obtained with vimos , ( 2 ) vvds-22h wide field ( @xmath16 ) and vvds-02h deep field ( @xmath17 ) , ( 3 ) median seeing estimated from the psf stars ( one taken per hour of observation ) .",
    "[ runs ]    at lower redshifts , the velocity fields of spiral / rotating disk galaxies have been used to place important constraints on total masses and hence on dark matter halo masses @xcite .",
    "these rotating disks produce a tully - fisher relationship ( the scaling law between total dynamical mass and the luminous stellar mass ) which has apparently not evolved in slope and scatter since @xmath18 .",
    "therefore the large scatter found in previously reported tully - fisher relationships at moderate redshifts is produced by galaxies with perturbed rotation or complex kinematics .",
    "the importance of the role of the non - ordered motion through the gas velocity dispersion for galaxies showing a perturbed rotation was investigated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they defined a new tracer of galaxy - dark halo potential , which combines dynamical support from the rotation with that of the non - ordered motion .",
    "the new stellar mass tully - fisher relation shows no detectable evolution neither in slope or of its intercept up to z@xmath11.2 * * @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional velocity fields allow rotation curves to be deduced in a more robust manner than slit spectra * * @xcite .",
    "ifs allows pure rotationally - supported disks to be distinguished from other dynamically - disturbed galaxies , which include minor or major mergers , merger remnants and/or inflow / outflows .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the kinematic properties of the ionized gas and star formation rates of a sample of ten galaxies at @xmath19 selected in the vimos vlt deep survey ( vvds ) , using integral field unit ( ifu ) @xmath20-band and @xmath21-band spectroscopy with vlt / sinfoni .",
    "the results presented here are part of a study to investigate kinematics and physical properties of unbiased samples representative of the global intermediate and high-@xmath22 population .",

    "in addition , most of them have not yet converted the majority of their gas into stars ( six galaxies have their gas fraction @xmath4 50 per cent ) .",
    "therefore , the galaxies which already have a stable disk ( six of them ) would have their final stellar mass similar to the present - day spirals , to which these rotating systems can be seen as precursors .",
    "we also investigated the stellar mass tully - fisher relation at 1.2@xmath0z@xmath01.5 and found a scatter between the rd disk galaxies and the dd disk galaxies .",
    "we also found for this two groups of objects a change of the zero point in comparison with the stellar mass tully - fisher relation in the local universe , but this is speculative considering the statistics of our sample .    although , we have presented results on the dynamical structure and the physical properties of a small sample of star - forming galaxies at 1.0@xmath0z@xmath01.5 , we have been able to investigate the dynamical type and the physical properties of late - type objects at this intermediate redshifts .",
    "increasing the samples at different redshift ranges for which near - infrared ifs data and multi - wavelength broad - band photometric data can be obtained , will definitely develop our understanding of the dynamical characteristics and nature of various systems ( mergers , rotating disks , etc . ) and therefore will lead us to understand how galaxies have evolved to match the present - day hubble sequence .",
