    "two puzzles for a nucleon , which is believed to connect to its chiral properties , remain to be explained theoretically . the first one concerns with the mechanism for the stability of a nucleon ; the second one is the nucleon @xmath0 term discrepancy problem , which is made more severe by recent analysis of the pion  nuclon scattering data .",
    "\\1 ) despite the success of the bag and/or non - topological solitonic type of models for a nucleon in the case of a single nucleon , a serious potential problem for these models exists when one tries to describe many nucleon systems , like a nucleus , base on these models .",
    "on the one hand , there are empirical evidences which imply that a nucleon inside of a nucleus keeps most of its identity . on the other hand ,",
    "the theoretical models allow the solution for a nucleon inside a nucleus to change significantly compared to the free space solution to favor a bag or a soliton of multi - quarks rather than the phenomenologically successful picture of a nucleus that can be described using the nucleon and meson degrees of freedom .",
    "albeit arguments for a kind of equivalence between these two pictures were put forward in literature , the quantitative justification of this picture in realistic situations is still lacking .",
    "it implies that perhaps certain elements of an essential physics have not been understood so far .",
    "it is expected that a study of this possibility using the local theory recently developed could lead to a way out of the dilemma @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) due to the approximate chiral symmetry in strong interaction , which is only explicitly broken by a tiny current mass for the light quarks , the low energy dynamics involving pion is very accurately constrained by the chiral symmetry of qcd . indeed",
    "the goldberger ",
    "treiman relation , the adler ",
    "weisberger relation and other chiral relations are confirmed by data @xcite even with an extension of the pcac relation @xcite , which includes the possibility that there is a vector type virtual color superconducting phase .",
    "such an expected success fails to reappear in the next leading order in the current quark mass .",
    "the resulting nucleon @xmath5 term , which is a measure of the scalar charge of the nucleon multiplied by the current quark mass , seems to be poorly connected to the on shell pion nucleon compton scattering data .",
    "the analysis of the most current data @xcite generates even greater values for @xmath0 on the cheng  dashen point than the old one @xcite  making the descrepancy larger ( @xmath6 effect ) .",
    "the lattice qcd evaluation @xcite of the same quantity also produces a larger value . under the conventional chiral symmetry breaking picture",
    ", this is indeed very puzzling : why the leading order relations are so accurately confirmed by data and at the same time the next leading order one fails @xmath7 , given the fact that the expected error should be at most around @xmath8 with @xmath9 the mass of a pion and @xmath10 gev . assuming a large strangeness content for a nucleon may not be consistent with other observables for the nucleon @xcite .",
    "the way to resolve the nucleon @xmath0 problem without certain new insight about the structure of the nucleon is a challenge if the chiral symmetry is regarded to be only slightly broken at low energy , as it manifests itself in the leading order and in many other observables .",
    "the reason for the leading order results not to be affected by whether or not there is a metastable color superconducting phase @xcite is not hard to understand .",
    "the quantities that are sensitive to the possible metastable color superconducting phases are evaluated on the pion mass shell , resulting in a pion dominance .",
    "the quantity , namely @xmath11 , which is not evaluated on the pion mass shell is however a quantity that is insensitive to the low energy chiral dynamics .",
    "in fact the scale that determines the change of @xmath11 with the momentum transfer is controlled by a scale of order @xmath10 gev @xcite .",
    "the nucleon @xmath0 term on the other hand does not enjoy such an insensitivity .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study whether or not these difficulties of the conventional picture for the nucleon could provide a useful source of information for a semi - quantitative discussion of various basic properties of a nucleon in the light of the local theory developed recently .",
    "there are several new features in the local theory .",
    "first of all , it is based on an 8component `` real '' representation for fermions , which is not equivalent to the currently adopted frame ",
    "work for relativistic processes at finite density @xcite .",
    "some of the advantages of this representation are discussed in ref .",
    "second , the statistical gauge invariance , dark component for local observables and the statistical blocking effects can be studied in the new frame - work @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to study what is its implication on a possible simultaneous solution of the aforementioned problems .",
    "it serves as a further consistency check of the mechanisms proposed here and in our earlier publications .",
    "qualitative discussion of such a solution to the nucleon stability problem is proposed recently @xcite , in which it is argued that the statistical blocking effects of the strong interaction vacuum state can be the underlying physical mechanism for the stability of a nucleon inside of a nucleus and nuclear matter@xcite .",
    "it remains to be investigated quantitatively as to whether or not such a mechanism is right in the sense that 1 ) it respects constraints of the chiral ward ",
    "takahashi identities and 2 ) it could reproduce at least two of the most important physical properties of the nucleon , namely , its size and its mass with reasonable model assumptions and parameters",
    ". this work aims at a semi - quantitative study of this question .",
    "a model picture for the nucleon has to be established and the physics and order of magnitude estimate of the possible quantitative properties of the model could then be derived .",
    "the nucleon @xmath0 term problem is also not a qualitative problem in the local theory if one assumes that there is at least one metastable color superconducting phase @xcite .",
    "new developments are made both in the theoretical and phenomenological directions @xcite , which indicate that such a possibility can be oberved and further more is favored by the evidences considered .",
    "however these studies contains very little specific properties of the nucleon structure .",
    "it seems that a more quantitative study of the nucleon @xmath0 problem is the natural next step .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "section [ sec : global ] contains an introduction of the chiral models for low and intermediate energy strong interaction , a discussion of the vacuum phenomenology in terms of wave function renormalized quasi - particles of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , an introduction of a model for a nucleon and a determination of its size under such a scenario when the value of @xmath0 is kept constant . a semi - quantitative mechanism for the stability of a nucleon inside of a nucleus and/or nuclear matter",
    "is suggested and discussed in section [ sec : stability ] .",
    "it is based upon the local theory in which the fermion fields are represented by an 8-component `` real '' spinor . the possible role played by the metastable color superconducting phases for the strong interaction vacuum state",
    "is discussed in section [ sec : local ] .",
    "the discrepancy of the nucleon @xmath0 term extracted from different sources is resolved by assuming the existence of a virtual color superconducting phase for the strong interaction vacuum state , in which , a virtual color superconducting component for a nucleon lives . the difference in energy density between the true chiral symmetry breaking ground state and the virtual color superconducting phase",
    "is estimated based on available data .",
    "the section [ sec : discussion ] contains further discussions .",
    "a summary is given in the last section .",
    "the standard model for strong interaction is qcd from which relevant non - perturbative information about the vacuum and hadron structure interested in this study is not easy to extract .",
    "although lattice simulation could provide a first principle investigation of the problem , it is still not satisfactory .",
    "full qcd is also too complicated for the present purpose .",
    "simplified models constructed based on the slightly ( explicit ) broken chiral symmetry of the qcd lagrangian in the fermionic sectors are frequently used , which are regarded as corresponding to the effective lagrangian of qcd when the gluonic degrees of freedom are functionally integrated out .",
    "this effective lagrangian is further simplified by assuming that only 4-point contact 4-point quark ",
    "quark interaction terms are dominant .",
    "the well known t hooft interaction due to instanton @xcite is one of them .",
    "this kind of models are quite successful in describing a large collection of the hadronic phenomena ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "it indicates that these models contain elements of the truth about the physics of strong interaction .    in the present section ,",
    "attempts are made in the following to justify the picture that nucleons are made up of loosely bound constituent quarks in a chiral bag .",
    "the mass and wave function renormalization of these dressed quarks are generated by the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry , which is governed by an 4point quark ",
    "quark interaction .",
    "albeit the long range confinement effects are not considered in these models , they are expected to be reasonable ones for the ground state chiral properties of hadrons , in which quarks are not separated far apart .",
    "the underlying qcd plays very little direct role as far as the chiral properties are concerned once these quantities are renormalized using relevant data from observations .",
    "other quantities of interest here that detailed qcd dynamics may play more important role like the confinement , the wave function renormalization of the quark fields , the bag constant and the energy density of the possible virtual color superconducting phase are , instead of predicted by the models , fitted to experimental data . if possible , a comparison with available lattice qcd data is going to be carried out to test the consistency of the model assumptions .",
