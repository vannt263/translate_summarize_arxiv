    "<S> we show that for @xmath4 not too heavy , @xmath5 in the mssm with heavy sparticles can be substantially smaller than in the sm due the charged higgs box contributions and in particular due to the growing like @xmath6 contribution of the double penguin diagrams involving neutral higgs boson exchanges .    </S>",

    "<S> , it is particularly important to discuss possible effects of new physics contributions to @xmath7 processes : @xmath0 and @xmath8 mass differences and to the cp violation parameter @xmath2 . in general models of new physics </S>",
    "<S> fall into the two following broad classes : + @xmath9 models in which the ckm matrix remains the unique source of flavour and cp violation - so - called minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) models  @xcite and their generalizations ( gmfv models ) . in the gmfv models the non sm - like operators contribute significantly to the effective low energy hamiltonian  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + @xmath9 models with entirely new sources of flavour and/or cp violation . </S>",
    "<S> + on the basis of the analysis  @xcite we discuss here two examples of the gmfv models : the large @xmath3 limit of the 2hdm(ii ) and of the mssm , in which the ckm matrix is the only source of flavour and cp violation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the effective weak hamiltonian for @xmath7 transitions in the gmvf models can be written as follows [ heff ] h_eff^=2 = g_f^2m_w^216 ^ 2 _ i v^i_ckm c_i ( ) q_i  . where @xmath10 are the set of 8 dimension six @xmath7 operators  @xcite and @xmath11 are the appropriate ckm factors . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0,@xmath5 and @xmath2 can be expressed in terms of , respectively , three real functions  @xcite f^d_tt = s_0(x_t ) 1+f_d  , f^s_tt = s_0(x_t ) 1+f_s  , f^_tt = s_0(x_t ) 1+f _  , @xmath12 for @xmath13 gev . </S>",
    "<S> we have then @xmath14 the functions @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be expressed in terms of @xmath18 as @xmath19 + { 1\\over4r}c^{\\rm vrr}_1(\\mu_t)+ \\bar p_1^{\\rm lr } c^{\\rm lr}_1(\\mu_t )   + \\bar p_2^{\\rm lr } c^{\\rm lr}_2(\\mu_t ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\bar p_1^{\\rm sll}\\left[c^{\\rm sll}_1(\\mu_t)+c^{\\rm srr}_1(\\mu_t)\\right ] + \\bar p_2^{\\rm sll}\\left[c^{\\rm sll}_2(\\mu_t)+c^{\\rm srr}_2(\\mu_t)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where  @xcite @xmath20 and the factors @xmath21 are given in  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider first the 2hdm(ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> at 1-loop only the charged scalar is relevant for the box diagrams contributing to and mixing . for large @xmath3 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 the leading terms of such contributions to the wilson coefficients @xmath18 are of the order of ( see  @xcite for the complete expressions ) : @xmath23 for diagrams with @xmath24 , and @xmath25 for diagrams with @xmath26 . for large </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 the biggest contribution appears in @xmath27 and is further enhanced , compared to the sm amplitude , by the qcd renormalization effects  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is of the opposite sign than given by the @xmath28 box diagram and can be significant only for the @xmath29-@xmath30 mixing ( so that it can compete with the sm contribution - see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bcrs9 ] ) , for which it is of the order of @xmath31 similar contributions for @xmath32-@xmath33 and transitions are suppressed by factors @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , and thus very small .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     unfortunately , the new cleo experimental result for the process @xmath36 set the bound @xmath37 gev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the 2hdm(ii ) for the still allowed range of charged higgs boson mass the effects in @xmath8 can not be large .    as a second realistic gmfv model we consider the mssm with the ckm as the only source of flavour / cp violation . </S>",
    "<S> in the limit of heavy sparticles ( practically realized already for @xmath38 gev ) the 1-loop box diagrams involving charginos and stops are negligible . </S>",
    "<S> however , for large @xmath3 even if sparticles are heavy they can still compensate the @xmath39 contribution to the @xmath40 amplitude allowing for the existence of a light , @xmath41 gev ) , charged higgs boson  @xcite . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bcrs9 ] it follows therefore that , even for @xmath42 and already at the 1-loop level the contribution of the mssm higgs sector to the @xmath43 wilson coefficient can be non - negligible .    at the 2-loop level in the mssm one has to take into account the dominant 2-loop electroweak corrections , modifying the yukawa - type interactions . even for heavy sparticles these corrections can significantly modify  @xcite the 2hdm(ii ) relations between the masses @xmath44 and the yukawa couplings @xmath45 , as well as induce additional , @xmath46 , terms in the charged higgs - quark couplings  @xcite . for the @xmath7 processes the most important ( for non - negligible mixing of the top squarks ) </S>",
    "<S> is however their third effect , that is the generation of the flavour non - diagonal , @xmath3 enhanced couplings of the neutral higgs bosons to down - type quarks  @xcite . additional contributions to @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are then generated by the double penguin diagrams involving the neutral higgs bosons exchanges . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant terms obtained from such contributions are @xmath50 with @xmath51 given by ( the matrices @xmath52 and @xmath53 are defined in  @xcite ) : @xmath54 where the function @xmath55 is given in  @xcite and the factor @xmath56 reads as @xmath57\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath6 factor in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : babucor ] ) appears because the dominant part of the effective flavour off - diagonal yukawa coupling is given  @xcite by the flavour - changing chargino contribution to the @xmath58-quark self energy ( @xmath59 ) , multiplied by the tree - level yukawa coupling ( also @xmath59 ) . </S>",
    "<S> two powers of the external light quark masses in  ( [ eqn : babucor ] ) are canceled by the fermion propagators on internal lines .    for @xmath60 , @xmath61 is close to zero  @xcite , but the correction @xmath62 is proportional to @xmath63 which is not suppressed in this limit . </S>",
    "<S> approximating the dimensionless factor @xmath51 by unity , it is easy to see that in the case of the mixing this correction can be for @xmath64 and @xmath65 gev as large as @xmath66 i.e. of the same order of magnitude as the sm contribution to @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bcrs13 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> an important features of the double penguin contribution are : _ </S>",
    "<S> i ) _ its fixed negative sign , the same as the sign of the dominant effects of the charged higgs box diagrams at large @xmath3 ; _ ii ) _ its strong dependence on the left - right mixing of the top squarks - from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bcrs13 ] it follows that large values of the stop mixing parameter @xmath68 are excluded already by the present experimental data ; _ iii ) _ it does not vanish when the mass scale of the sparticles is increased uniformly - large effects decreasing @xmath5 can be present also for the heavy sparticles provided the higgs boson masses remain low . </S>",
    "<S> + summarizing , we found that : + @xmath9 the largest effects of new contributions for large @xmath3 are seen in @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding contributions to @xmath0 and @xmath2 are strongly suppressed by the smallness of @xmath58-quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> + @xmath9 the dominant contributions to @xmath5 for large @xmath3 originate from double penguin diagrams involving neutral higgs particles and , to a lesser extent , in the box diagrams with charged higgs exchanges . + </S>",
    "<S> * @xmath9 * the contribution of double penguins grows like @xmath6 and interferes destructively with the sm contribution , suppressing considerably @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> it depends strongly on stop mixing , excluding large values of the mixing parameter @xmath68 . </S>"
