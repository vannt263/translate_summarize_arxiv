    "this @xmath0 asymmetry is then partially reprocessed into a baryon asymmetry by standard model electroweak sphaleron processes @xcite , thus providing an explanation for the origin of the cosmic baryon asymmetry . in this framework",
    "the rh neutrinos only have yukawa interactions , which are responsible for a non - vanishing rh neutrino distribution as well as for the crucial @xmath0 washout processes .",
    "this picture is to some extent oversimplified and can dramatically change whenever the rh neutrinos possess additional interactions beyond those of the simplest type - i seesaw scenario .",
    "this is indeed what happens in seesaw models with spontaneous lepton number breaking in which rh neutrino masses rather than being put in `` by hand '' , arise via a dynamical mechanism , similar to the breaking of the standard model gauge symmetry .    in this paper",
    "we study the effects induced by these new right - handed neutrino couplings upon the rh neutrino distribution , which ultimately affect the resulting @xmath0 asymmetry . while similar considerations apply also to theories of gauged lepton number , such as models with a local u(1 ) lepton number symmetry @xcite , pati - salam  @xcite , left - right symmetric  @xcite , here we focus upon the simplest scheme based upon spontaneously broken ungauged lepton number  @xcite .",

    "these processes involve many free parameters .",
    "however , we have identified the two new parameters which best describe the implications of such scatterings in the generation of the @xmath0 asymmetry . within our simple description",
    "we have shown that scattering processes can change the conventional picture . first note that the heat bath will be populated with the intervening scalars , either produced by reheating or via their couplings with the standard model higgs . in this case the rh neutrino density in the thermal bath will be determined by the novel scattering reactions rather than by inverse decays . in the parameter regions where these reactions are slow in the relevant temperature range , their presence will tend to enhance the @xmath0 yield , provided the dirac neutrino yukawa couplings lie in the weak washout regime .",
    "a direct consequence of this is that of the @xmath0 asymmetry will no longer depend upon initial conditions , something inherent to the `` standard '' picture in the weak washout regime .",
    "in contrast , if the new scatterings are fast the rh neutrino distribution will closely follow a thermal distribution .",
    "although such effect will tend to suppress the @xmath0 yield , it need not invalidate the @xmath0 production mechanism , provided the cp - asymmetry is large enough .",
    "in any case , a proper treatment of the @xmath0 asymmetry generation mechanism within these schemes requires the inclusion of rh neutrino annihilations , as long as the relevant couplings are sizeable .    before closing let us mention that the presence of goldstone bosons , such as the majoron , if associated to low - scale symmetry breaking , may give rise to other non - standard signatures .",
    "for example , it can induce a large standard model higgs invisible decay mode  @xcite .",
    "the restrictions on the parameter space are determined by the upper limit on the invisible decay width of the higgs boson .",
    "the current upper bound given by the atlas collaboration  @xcite for the invisible decay mode branching ratio is not too stringent , allowing for invisible modes ranging from 10% up to 75% , and thus leaving large fractions of parameter space still open . in the next lhc",
    "run a better sensitivity to this mode will be possible .",
    "on the other hand , these schemes may also lead to exotic lepton flavor violating decays with majoron emission , such as @xmath197 or @xmath198  @xcite . in any case",
    "all these possibilities require low scale , which do not fit within the minimal dynamical leptogenesis schemes considered above . extended seesaw leptogenesis schemes with right - handed neutrino scatterings lie outside the scope of this paper .",

    "<S> in the simplest type - i seesaw leptogenesis scenario right - handed neutrino annihilation processes are absent . </S>",

    "<S> a prominent example is provided by models with spontaneous lepton number violation , where the existence of new dynamical degrees of freedom can play a crucial role . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , we provide a model - independent discussion of the effects of right - handed neutrino annihilations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the weak washout regime , as long as the scattering processes remain slow compared with the hubble expansion rate throughout the relevant temperature range , the efficiency can be largely enhanced , reaching in some cases maximal values . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the @xmath0 asymmetry yield turns out to be independent upon initial conditions , in contrast to the `` standard '' case . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> when the annihilation processes are fast , the right - handed neutrino distribution tends to a thermal one down to low temperatures , implying a drastic suppression of the efficiency which in some cases can render the @xmath0 generation mechanism inoperative . </S>"
