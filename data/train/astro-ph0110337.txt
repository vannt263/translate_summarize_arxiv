    "the spatial correlation function of galaxy clusters provides an important cosmological test , as both the amplitude of the correlation function and its dependence upon mean intercluster separation are determined by the underlying cosmological model . in hierarchical models of structure formation , the spatial correlation length , @xmath3 , is predicted to be an increasing function of cluster mass , with the precise value of @xmath3 and its mass dependence determined by @xmath4 ( or equivalently @xmath5 , using the constraint on @xmath6 from the local cluster mass function ) and the shape parameter @xmath7 . low density and low @xmath7 models generally predict stronger clustering for a given mass and a greater dependence of the correlation length upon cluster mass .    in this paper we utilize the las campanas distant cluster survey ( lcdcs ) to provide a new , independent measurement of the dependence of the cluster correlation length upon the mean intercluster separation ( @xmath8 ) at mean separations comparable to existing abell and apm studies .",
    "we first measure the angular correlation function for a series of subsamples at @xmath9 and then derive the corresponding @xmath3 values via the cosmological limber inversion @xcite .",
    "the resulting values constitute the first measurements of the spatial correlation length for clusters at @xmath10 .",
    "popular structure formation models predict only a small amount of evolution from @xmath11 to the present - a prediction that we test by comparison of our results with local observations .",
    "the recently completed las campanas distant cluster survey is the largest published catalog of galaxy clusters at @xmath12 , containing 1073 candidates @xcite .",
    "clusters are detected in the lcdcs as regions of excess surface brightness relative to the mean sky level , a technique that permits wide - area coverage with a minimal investment of telescope time .",
    "the final statistical catalog covers an effective area of 69 square degrees within a @xmath13 strip of the southern sky ( @xmath14 @xmath15 mpc at @xmath1=0.5 for @xmath5=0.3 @xmath16cdm ) .",
    "gonzalez et al . ( 2001@xmath17 ) also provide estimated redshifts ( @xmath18 ) , based upon the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) magnitude - redshift relation , that are accurate to @xmath215% at @xmath19 , and demonstrate the existence of a correlation between the peak surface brightness , @xmath20 , and velocity dispersion , @xmath21 .",
    "together these two properties enable construction of well - defined subsamples that can be compared directly with simulations and observations of the local universe .      to compute the two - point angular correlation function",
    ", we use the estimator of landy & szalay ( 1993 ) .",
    "we measure the angular correlation function both for the full lcdcs catalog and for three approximately velocity dispersion - limited subsamples at @xmath1@xmath20.5 ( figure [ fig : fig1]@xmath17 ) .",
    "we restrict all subsamples to @xmath18@xmath220.35 to avoid incompleteness , while the maximum redshift is determined by the surface brightness threshold of the subsample .",
    "the angular correlation function for the entire lcdcs catalog is shown in the upper panel of figure [ fig : fig1]@xmath23 , with logarithmic angular bins of width @xmath24=0.2 . modeling this correlation function as a power law , @xmath25 a least - squares fit for all lcdcs clusters over the range 2@xmath26 - 5@xmath27 yields @xmath28=1.83@xmath290.12 and @xmath30=56@xmath31 .",
    "the angular correlation function for the lowest redshift subsample is shown in the lower panel of figure [ fig : fig1]@xmath23 , overlaid with a best - fit power law .",
    "we derive best - fit values both allowing @xmath28 to vary as a free parameter and also fixing @xmath28=2.1  equivalent to the best - fit value for the lowest redshift subsample and the best fit value for the rosat all - sky survey 1 bright sample @xcite .",
    "we then apply a correction to these best - fit values to account for the impact of false detections in the lcdcs catalog , which for this data set act to suppress the amplitude of the observed correlation function .",
    "if we assume that the contamination is spatially correlated and can be described by a power law with the same slope as the cluster angular correlation function ( a reasonable approximation because for galaxies  which are likely the primary contaminant  @xmath28@xmath21.8 - 1.9 [ e.g. 2 , 19 ] ) , then the observed value of @xmath32 is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the fractional contamination . for detections induced by isolated galaxies of the same magnitude as bcg s at @xmath35 ( and identified as galaxies by the automated identification criteria described in gonzalez et al .",
    "( 2001@xmath17 ) , we measure that @xmath36 is comparable to @xmath37 , the net clustering amplitude for all lcdcs candidates at 0.3@xmath0@xmath18@xmath00.8 . for detections identified as low surface brightness galaxies ( including some nearby dwarf galaxies )",
    "we measure @xmath38 .",
    "while these systems are strongly clustered , we expect that they comprise less than half of the contamination in the lcdcs .",
    "for multiple sources of contamination the effective clustering amplitude @xmath39 , so the effective clustering strength of the contamination is @xmath40 even including the lsb s .",
    "the observed angular correlation function can be used to determine the three - space correlation length if the redshift distribution of the sample is known .",
    "this is accomplished via the cosmological limber inversion @xcite . for a power - law correlation function with redshift dependence @xmath41 , @xmath42",
    "the corresponding comoving spatial correlation length is @xmath43 , and the limber equation is @xmath44 }              \\left [          \\frac{\\int_{z1}^{z2 } ( dn / dz)^2 e(z ) d_{a}(z)^{1-\\gamma }         f(z ) ( 1+z ) dz }                                                               { \\left(\\int_{z1}^{z2 } ( dn / dz ) dz\\right)^2}\\right]^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the redshift distribution of the sample , @xmath46 is the angular diameter distance , and @xmath47 is defined as in peebles ( 1993 ) .",
    "because little evolution in the clustering is expected over the redshift intervals spanned by our subsamples ( see figure [ fig : cfvslocal ] ) , @xmath41 can be pulled out of the integral .    for the lcdcs we estimate the true redshift distributions of our subsamples based upon the observed distribution of estimated redshifts .",
    "if we approximate the redshift error distribution as gaussian with @xmath48 at @xmath1=0.5 @xcite , then the actual redshift distribution @xmath45 is approximately equal to the observed redshift distribution @xmath49 for a given subsample convolved with this gaussian scatter . to test the validity of this approach",
    ", we also try modeling @xmath45 using the theoretical mass function of sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) convolved with redshift uncertainty . comparing these two methods",
    "we find that the derived spatial correlation lengths agree to better than 3% for all subsamples .",

    "we opt to fix @xmath28=2.1 when deriving the correlation lengths in table [ tab : ro ] because @xmath28 is strongly covariant with @xmath32 and hence poorly constrained by the lcdcs data set . in no instance does this choice alter the derived @xmath3 value by more than 10% from the value obtained when @xmath28 is treated as a free parameter , but we caution that it can systematically bias the observed dependence of @xmath3 upon @xmath50 . for subsamples with best - fit values of @xmath28@xmath222.1 ,",
    "fixing gamma slightly increases the derived value of @xmath3 , which results in a mild steepening of the dependence of @xmath3 upon @xmath50 for the lcdcs subsamples .",
    "the cluster correlation function is predicted to not evolve significantly between @xmath1=0.5 and the present ; we thus compare the lcdcs results directly with local observations , as is shown in figure [ fig : cfvslocal ] for @xmath16cdm and @xmath60cdm . for both cosmologies",
    "the lcdcs values of @xmath3 are comparable to those from the edinburgh - durham galaxy catalogue @xcite , apm survey @xcite , and the mx survey northern sample @xcite , but smaller than those found by peacock & west ( 1992 ) for the abell catalog . also shown",

    "the other lines are analytic predictions based upon the work of sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) . like the apm data , the lcdcs results are consistent with the low - density models ( independent of @xmath61 ) .",
    "in contrast , the plotted @xmath60cdm model systematically underestimates both the local and @xmath1=0.5 data .",

    "2001@xmath23 for more detail ) .",
    "we find that our results can only be significantly altered if the uncertainty in the estimated redshifts is underestimated .",
    "if so , then the correlation lengths we derive would be systematically too small ( by @xmath22 @xmath15 mpc if @xmath62=0.25 , for example ) . the second most significant potential systematic arises from fixing @xmath28 , which as mentioned above may lead us to overestimate the dependence of @xmath3 upon @xmath50 .",
    "treating @xmath28 as a free parameter would reduce the derived @xmath3 values for the three subsamples ( in order of increasing @xmath50 ) by 0% , 7% , and 10% , but would not qualitatively change our results .",
    "the las campanas distant cluster survey is the largest existing catalog of clusters at @xmath1@xmath220.3 , providing a unique sample with which to study the properties of the cluster population .",
    "we use the lcdcs to constrain the cluster - cluster angular correlation function , providing the first measurements for a sample with a mean redshift @xmath1@xmath630.2 . from the observed angular correlation function ,",
    "we derive the spatial correlation length , @xmath3 , as a function of mean separation , @xmath50 . only modest evolution in the clustering amplitude",
    "is predicted between @xmath11 and present , and we thus compare our results directly with local data .",
    "we find that the lcdcs correlation lengths agree with results from local samples , and observe a dependence of @xmath3 upon @xmath50 that is comparable to the results of croft et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for the apm catalog .",
    "this clustering strength , its dependence on number density , and its minimal redshift evolution are consistent with analytic expectations for low density models , and with results from the @xmath16cdm hubble volume simulations .",
    "consequently , while statistical uncertainty limits our ability to discriminate between cosmological models , our results are in concordance with the flat @xmath16cdm model favored by recent supernovae and cosmic microwave background observations @xcite .",
    "a final result of this analysis is that it demonstrates the utility of large catalogs like the lcdcs that are statistical in nature . while the properties of any particular cluster in the lcdcs catalog are rather uncertain , the properties of the sample as a whole are well - defined , which is sufficient for constraining properties such as the clustering strength and evolution in the comoving number density .",
    "this statistical approach requires a relatively small investment in telescope time , and so can be extended in the future to much larger samples than the lcdcs .",
