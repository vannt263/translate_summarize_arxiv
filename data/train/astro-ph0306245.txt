    "type i x - ray bursts are well - understood as thermonuclear flashes on the surface of an accreting neutron star ( see lewin , van paradijs , & taam 1995 ; strohmayer & bildsten 2003 for reviews ) .",
    "the basic theory was outlined more than twenty years ago ( for an overview , see fujimoto , hanawa , & miyaji 1981 ; bildsten 1998 ) , successfully explaining the typical burst energies ( @xmath15@xmath16 ) , durations ( @xmath10@xmath17 ) , and recurrence times ( hours to days ) .",
    "however , detailed comparisons of theory and observations have had mixed success ( fujimoto et al .  1987 ; van paradijs , penninx , & lewin 1988 ; bildsten 2000 ; galloway et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the ultracompact binary 4u  1820 - 30 ( @xmath18 ; stella , priedhorsky , & white 1987 ) is a promising system for such a comparison .",
    "it has a known distance , being located in the metal - rich globular cluster ngc  6624 ( @xmath19fe@xmath20h@xmath21\\approx -0.4 $ ] , distance @xmath22 ) ; rich , minniti , & liebert 1993 ; kuulkers et al .",
    "it undergoes a regular @xmath23 day accretion cycle ( priedhorsky & terrell 1984 ) , switching between high and low states differing by a factor @xmath24 in accretion rate ( e.g.  see the _ rxte_/asm light curve in figure 1 of strohmayer & brown 2002 ) . in the low state ,",
    "regular type i bursts are seen ( @xmath25 days around the minimum luminosity ; chou & grindlay 2001 ) , with recurrence times @xmath26@xmath5 hours ( clark et al .",

    "no bursts are seen during the rest of the cycle , implying a `` non - bursting '' mode of burning ( e.g.  bildsten 1995 ) . in the low state , 4u  1820 - 30",
    "has also shown an extremely energetic ( @xmath27 ) `` superburst '' , likely due to deep ignition of a carbon layer ( strohmayer & brown 2002 ; see kuulkers et al .",
    "2002 and strohmayer & bildsten 2003 for a summary of superburst properties ) .",
    "different evolutionary scenarios for 4u  1820 - 30 have been proposed .",
    "those involving direct collision of a red giant and a neutron star ( verbunt 1987 ) , or formation of a neutron star - main sequence binary by tidal capture ( bailyn & grindlay 1987 ) or an exchange interaction ( rasio , pfahl , & rappaport 2000 ) followed by a common envelope phase , lead to accretion of pure helium from the helium core of the red giant .",
    "a different picture is that the mass transfer starts just after central hydrogen exhaustion ( tutukov et al .",
    "1987 ; fedorova & ergma 1989 ; podsiadlowski , rappaport , & pfahl 2002 ) , in which case the accreted material is again mostly helium , but contains some hydrogen ( @xmath13@xmath28% by mass ; fedorova & ergma 1989 ; podsiadlowski , rappaport , & pfahl 2002 ) .",
    "the observed energetics and recurrence times of the type i bursts from 4u  1820 - 30 fit well with a picture of accumulation and burning of helium - rich material . the ratio of persistent fluence ( persistent flux integrated over the burst recurrence time ) to burst fluence is @xmath29 ( haberl et al .",
    "1987 ) . for a gravitational energy @xmath30 mev per nucleon",
    ", this implies a nuclear energy release @xmath31 mev per nucleon , as expected for helium burning to iron group elements .",
    "the mass of helium required to power the observed energetics is roughly the mass accreted in the burst recurrence time at the inferred accretion rate .",
    "the burst fluence @xmath32 ( haberl et al .",
    "1987 ) implies a total burst energy @xmath33 , or a mass of helium @xmath34 .",

    ", a mass @xmath39 is accreted in 3 hours , in excellent agreement with the observed recurrence times .",
    "a previous comparison of theory with observations of 4u  1820 - 30 was carried out by bildsten ( 1995 , hereafter b95 ) , who conducted time - dependent simulations of pure helium burning on accreting neutron stars .",
    "he found good agreement with observed energetics and recurrence times , but for a somewhat hotter base temperature than expected . in this paper ,",
    "i calculate ignition models for type i bursts from 4u  1820 - 30 , and survey the conditions necessary to ignite helium at the inferred mass @xmath39 .",
    "i allow for a small amount of hydrogen in the accreted material , and show that this has a large effect on the burst recurrence time , because of extra heating from hot cno hydrogen burning as the layer accumulates .",
    "finally , i discuss what we might learn from simultaneous modelling of type i bursts and superbursts .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "the main results are presented in  2 .",
    "i calculate the critical mass needed for ignition , and show the effect of hydrogen on recurrence times and energetics .",
    "i compare these results to observations of type i bursts , and to evolutionary models .",
    "finally , i use the constraints from type i bursts to construct ignition models for superbursts from 4u  1820 - 30 , and compare to the model of sb02 .",
    "i summarize in  3 , and discuss the remaining open issues .",
    "the physics and different regimes of nuclear burning on accreting neutron stars have been described by several authors ( for reviews , see lewin , van paradijs , & taam 1995 ; bildsten 1998 ) .",
    "here , i follow the x - ray burst ignition calculations of cumming & bildsten ( 2000 , hereafter cb00 ) .",
    "i adopt plane - parallel coordinates in the thin accreted layer , and work in terms of the column depth @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the hydrostatic pressure , @xmath43 is the density , and @xmath44 the surface gravity .",
    "i assume a @xmath45 neutron star with radius @xmath38 , giving @xmath46 where the gravitational redshift is @xmath47 ( similar to the value @xmath48 recently inferred from absorption lines in _ xmm _ burst spectra of exo  0748 - 676 ; cottam , paerels , & mendez 2002 ) .",
    "i include general relativistic effects when calculating observable quantities .",
    "cumming et al .",
    "( 2002 ) showed that the newtonian equations of cb00 have the same form under general relativity , as long as @xmath49 and @xmath50 refer to rest mass rather than gravitational mass .",
    "the thermal profile of the accumulating layer is described by the heat equation @xmath51 , where the opacity @xmath52 is calculated as described by schatz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and the entropy equation @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the heat flux , and @xmath55 contains contributions from hot cno hydrogen burning and compressional heating .",
    "compressional heating always plays a minor role at these accretion rates , giving @xmath56 per nucleon .",
    "the hot cno energy production rate is @xmath57 ( hoyle & fowler 1965 ) , where @xmath58 is the cno mass fraction .",
    "i follow the changing hydrogen abundance with depth as described in cb00 ( see eqn .  [ 3 ] of that paper ) . unless otherwise stated , i set @xmath59 .",
    "triple alpha burning during accumulation is not included , this has only a small effect on the ignition conditions .",
    "i assume the individual cno abundances are those of the equilibrium hot cno cycle ( @xmath60o and @xmath61o ) . in the pure he case ,",
    "the accreted @xmath60n survives to a density @xmath62 , when it converts to @xmath60c by electron capture ( hashimoto et al .",
    "for the conditions here , no further processing occurs until helium ignites via triple alpha .    to find the thermal profile , i repeatedly integrate downwards through the accreted layer , iterating until @xmath63 at the base , where @xmath64 is the heat flux from deeper layers . here , @xmath65 is the energy per nucleon released in the crust from pycnonuclear and electron capture reactions which escapes from the surface .",
    "brown ( 2000 ) showed that @xmath66 mev per nucleon @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "i assume @xmath69 is set by the time - averaged local accretion rate @xmath70 , rather than the instantaneous rate @xmath50 , because the thermal time in the crust is much longer than the @xmath71 month luminosity cycle . throughout this paper ,",
    "i assume the instantaneous rate when bursts are seen is half the time - average rate , @xmath72 ( as inferred from the _",
    "rxte_/asm lightcurve ; e.g.  figure 1 of sb02 ) .",
    "the ignition column depth @xmath73 is found by increasing the depth of the layer until the condition for ignition , @xmath74 ( fujimoto , hanawa , & miyaji 1981 ; fushiki & lamb 1987b ; bildsten 1998 ) , is met at the base .",
    "here @xmath75 is the triple alpha energy production rate ( fushiki & lamb 1987a ) , and @xmath76 is a local approximation to the radiative cooling .",
    "the ignition criterion ( [ eq : ign ] ) says that ignition occurs when the heating from triple alpha is more temperature sensitive than the cooling , and is large enough to change the temperature of the layer .",
    "following cb00 , we include a multiplicative factor of 1.9 in @xmath75 to account for proton captures on @xmath77c when hydrogen is present .",
    "the advantage of this `` semi - analytic '' approach is that it allows a survey of parameter space , while still giving a good estimate of the ignition depth . cb00",
    "compared the ignition conditions predicted by equation ( [ eq : ign ] ) with time - dependent models in the literature . for mixed h",
    "/ he ignition , the agreement was to @xmath14@xmath78% , and better than a factor of two for pure he ignitions .",
    "in addition , i have compared results for pure helium with those of b95 . for a given @xmath50 ,",
    "i adjust the flux from the base to match the base temperature specified by b95 . for the @xmath50 s",
    "relevant to this paper , i find that the ignition column depth from equation ( [ eq : ign ] ) underpredicts the ignition column by @xmath14@xmath78% .",
    "i estimate the burst energy by assuming complete burning of the accreted layer , and taking a nuclear energy release @xmath79 mev per nucleon , where @xmath80 is the mass - weighted mean @xmath81 in the layer at ignition .",
    "this expression for @xmath82 includes 35% energy loss in neutrinos during hydrogen burning ( fujimoto et al .",
    "this is appropriate for rp - process hydrogen burning up to iron group , and may be an overestimate for small @xmath83 , in which case we underestimate the burst energy by up to @xmath84% for @xmath85 . assuming the layer of fuel covers the whole star , the total burst energy is @xmath86 , where the @xmath87 factor accounts for gravitational redshift .",
    "hydrogen burning gives @xmath88 mev per nucleon , so that even a small amount of hydrogen burning during accumulation dominates the @xmath89 mev per nucleon coming from the crust .",
    "for pure helium accretion , @xmath90 sets the temperature of the accumulating layer .",
    "if hydrogen is present , the flux from the hot cno cycle is @xmath91 . here , @xmath92 is the column density of the layer which is burning hydrogen : this is either the column depth at which hydrogen runs out , or the depth at which helium ignites , whichever occurs first . whether @xmath93 depends on @xmath92 since this measures the amount of hydrogen burning . the time to burn",
    "all the hydrogen is @xmath94 , or @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the energy release per gram from hydrogen burning ( unlike cb00 , we include the energy release from neutrinos here as given by wallace & woosley 1981 ) , and @xmath83 is the initial hydrogen abundance . if the burst recurrence time @xmath97 , then helium ignition occurs before hydrogen exhaustion , giving @xmath98 .",
    "then requiring @xmath93 gives @xmath99 if @xmath100 , all of the hydrogen is burned before helium ignites , giving @xmath101",
    ". then @xmath102 is required for @xmath93 .    equations ( [ eq : condition1 ] ) and ( [ eq : condition2 ] ) show that if hydrogen burning is to affect the temperature profile in the layer , both the amount of hydrogen and the metallicity must be large enough .",

    "2002 ) , satisfying equation ( [ eq : condition2 ] ) .",

    "several authors have presented observations of regular bursting from 4u  1820 - 30 ( the first source to exhibit x - ray bursts ; grindlay et al .  1976 ) .",
    "clark et al .  ( 1976 ) saw 10 bursts with sas-3 with a recurrence time of @xmath104 ( a @xmath5% variation ) , and mean fluence @xmath105 ( @xmath106@xmath107 ) .",
    "the persistent flux was @xmath108 of the peak flux seen in the high state .",
    "further sas-3 observations of the transition from low to high state found 22 bursts ( clark et al .  1977 ) .",
    "the recurrence time decreased from @xmath109@xmath110 hours as the flux increased by a factor of @xmath13 .",

    "these bursts show a transition from regular to irregular bursting as persistent flux increases ( cornelisse et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the simplest model is to consider pure helium accretion at the rate inferred from the x - ray luminosity in  1 , and to take @xmath117 mev per nucleon , as found by brown ( 2000 ) . as a useful reference point",
    ", i refer to this accretion rate as @xmath118 .",
    "figure 1 shows the temperature profile at ignition for this case ( lower curve ) . the recurrence time and burst energy are @xmath13 times larger than the observed values .",
    "ignition occurs at a column depth @xmath119 , giving a recurrence time of @xmath120 , and burst energy @xmath121 .",
    "a model with hydrogen gives much better agreement .",

    "unfortunately , this result can not be taken as evidence for the presence of hydrogen .",
    "a larger flux from below will also heat the layer and lead to earlier ignition . for pure helium accretion at @xmath126",
    ", i find that @xmath127 mev per nucleon is required to bring the recurrence time down to @xmath24 hours .",
    "this is larger than expected from heating in the crust ( brown 2000 ) .",
    "however , additional heating might be provided by a previous x - ray burst .",
    "most of the energy released in a burst is radiated from the surface of the star ; however , some energy is conducted inwards , and emerges on a longer timescale .",
    "this effect has been emphasized by taam and coworkers ( taam 1980 ; taam et al .",
    "1993 ) , who refer to it as `` thermal inertia '' . to estimate the size of this effect , i assume a fraction @xmath128 of the nuclear energy flows inwards , and is released at a constant rate between bursts .",
    "the extra flux is then @xmath129 , giving a contribution to @xmath130 of @xmath89 mev per nucleon @xmath131 .",
    "this is likely an overestimate , since the energy release decreases over time .",
    "a better estimate requires time - dependent simulations of a sequence of bursts . for",

    "( 1987 ) , @xmath142 hours .",
    "there a few points worth noting .",
    "first , the ignition depth in the helium models is sensitive to @xmath65 , since this sets the temperature of the accumulating layer . as @xmath130 increases , @xmath73 decreases .",
    "second , hydrogen models show two regimes of behavior . if @xmath97 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : th ] ] ) , hydrogen burning occurs throughout the accumulating layer .",
    "then @xmath73 depends on the metallicity @xmath58 which determines the amount of hot cno burning , but not on @xmath130 or @xmath50 .",
    "as @xmath58 decreases , @xmath73 increases .",
    "an extreme case is model 7 in table [ tab:1 ] ( @xmath143 ) , in which case little heating occurs and the ignition conditions are similar to pure helium . if @xmath100 , hydrogen runs out and ignition occurs in a pure helium layer .",
    "then @xmath73 is sensitive to @xmath50 , explaining the steep increases in @xmath137 and @xmath138 for the h models in figure [ fig : recur ] ( see cb00 for more discussion of these different regimes ) .    in general",
    ", the burst energy is @xmath144 in these models , by factors of up to @xmath145% .",
    "this discrepancy is easily accounted for by anisotropic burst emission ( e.g.  lapidus & sunyaev 1985 ; fujimoto 1988 ) ( although there may be other explanations , see discussion in  3.1 ) . for the remainder of this section , i renormalize the predicted fluence to agree with the _ exosat _ mean value ( haberl et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : f4 ] shows the expected _ variations _ in burst fluence and recurrence time as a function of persistent flux .",
    "i show hydrogen models with metallicity @xmath59 ( @xmath146 and @xmath147 ) , a low metallicity model @xmath143 ( @xmath146 ) , and a helium model with @xmath135 .",
    "i assume @xmath65 is independent of accretion rate , not including any variations with @xmath50 because of thermal inertia . in each case , i normalize the @xmath148@xmath50 relation to give @xmath149 for @xmath150 ( haberl et al .",
    "1987 ) . to do this",
    ", i write @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the gravitational energy release ( @xmath153 mev per nucleon for @xmath154 ) , and the factor @xmath155 accounts for the anisotropy of the x - ray emission , as well as additional uncertainties such as luminosity emerging at other wavelengths .",

    "the values of @xmath157 implied are @xmath158 @xmath159 for the pure he ( @xmath122 ) model .",

    "the expected variation of recurrence time with @xmath50 agrees qualitatively with the observed behavior in that recurrence time drops with increasing @xmath148 .",

    "gives @xmath166 for these observations , less than the exosat value and consistent with a longer @xmath137 .",

    "hydrogen models show a change in fluence of @xmath84% as the recurrence time varies over the observed range , whereas the helium and low metallicity models have roughly constant fluence .",
    "when hydrogen is present , the variation arises because the composition of the layer at ignition changes according to the amount of hydrogen burning that occurs during accumulation .",

    "( 1977 ) observations , measurements for individual bursts from haberl et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , and the mean fluence reported by clark et al .",
    "there is a @xmath171% variation in the reported fluences .",
    "however , the error in the sas-3 fluence measurements is likely larger than this . for example , a reanalysis by clark ( reported by vacca et al .",
    "1986 ) gave a @xmath172% reduction in the peak luminosities of individual bursts .",

    "it perhaps could be addressed with the bepposax data ( cornelisse et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the requirement that @xmath173 if hydrogen is present , or @xmath133@xmath174 for pure helium , is a new constraint on evolutionary models .",

    "however , the amount of neutrino emission is strongly dependent on the peak temperature , and therefore carbon fraction and ignition depth ( cb01 ) .",
    "time - dependent models are therefore necessary to predict the superburst fluence .",
    "cb01 showed that for small carbon mass fractions , the carbon burns stably as the layer accumulates .",
    "table 3 gives the minimum @xmath187 required for unstable ignition for each model .",
    "the range of values is @xmath193@xmath136 .",
    "less carbon is required for smaller @xmath65 , as shown by cb01 .",
    "the values of @xmath194 given here are a little larger than those shown in cb01 s figure 2 because the less massive heavy element ( @xmath186fe rather than @xmath195ru ) results in a shallower temperature gradient .",
    "the recurrence time for @xmath196 is @xmath84% lower than the recurrence time for @xmath197 .",
    "in general , the models of type i x - ray bursts presented in  2 give good agreement with observed recurrence times and energetics .",
    "the observed @xmath4@xmath5h recurrence times are reproduced for a pure he companion if the time - averaged accretion rate is @xmath198@xmath199 , or a hydrogen - poor companion if @xmath8@xmath200 .",
    "this difference comes about because of extra heating from hot cno burning during accumulation when hydrogen is present , leading to earlier ignition , and requiring a lower @xmath201 to match the observed recurrence times .",
    "for hydrogen to affect the temperature profile in the layer requires @xmath2 and @xmath202 . if spallation reduces the metallicity in the accreted layer ( bildsten , salpeter , & wasserman 1992 ) , hydrogen burning will no longer play a role , in which case the accreting layer behaves like pure helium .",
    "these conclusions constrain evolutionary models , although both pure helium evolutionary models and those with hydrogen can be found that are consistent with the data . a promising way to distinguish between different evolutionary scenarios is accurate fluence measurements as a function of @xmath50 .",
    "models with hydrogen predict @xmath84% variations in burst fluence as recurrence time varies , whereas pure helium models show a much smaller variation .    for most models , recurrence time",
    "is expected to vary as @xmath203 , because the ignition depth ( determined by hot cno burning or by the flux from the crust ) is insensitive to accretion rate . however , sas-3 observations showed a much shallower dependence than the expected @xmath168 : clark et al .",
    "( 1977 ) observed the persistent flux increase by a factor of @xmath13 while @xmath170 went from @xmath109 to @xmath110 hours .",
    "studies of timing and spectral behavior of lmxbs indicate that @xmath132 is not necessarily well - correlated with the underlying accretion rate ( e.g.  van der klis et al .",
    "the observed behavior then requires @xmath50 to increase less quickly than @xmath132 .",
    "it would be interesting to study burst properties as a function of an accretion rate indicator ( e.g.  position in the color - color diagram ) rather than @xmath132 .",
    "variations in heating with @xmath50 due to thermal inertia might play some role , something that should be checked with time - dependent simulations .",
    "alternatively , these observations might indicate new physics , for example that the accreting material covers only part of the star at lower accretion rates , reducing the amount by which the local accretion rate changes ( a possibility suggested for hydrogen accretors by bildsten 2000 ) . an interesting exception to",
    "the predicted @xmath168 behavior is for models with @xmath204 , when the time to burn all the hydrogen is @xmath24 hours , in the range of observed recurrence times . for @xmath204 and @xmath205 hours , the recurrence time is predicted to increase rapidly with decreasing @xmath50 , because hydrogen burning no longer occurs throughout the layer .",
    "however , this is even less consistent with the observed variations .",
    "the burst energy is overpredicted in these models , in common with studies of other bursters .",
    "galloway et al .  ( 2003 ) find a factor of @xmath164@xmath5 discrepancy for gs 1826 - 24 , and following bildsten ( 2000 ) propose that the accreted fuel only partially covers the neutron star surface . for 4u  1636 - 56",
    ", fujimoto et al .  ( 1987 ) proposed that vertical mixing driven by rotational shear in the incoming material led to early ignition , and reduced burst energies . here , i find discrepancies of less than a factor of 2 for 4u  1820 - 30 .",
    "this is easily accomodated , for example , by anisotropic burst emission ( lapidus & sunyaev 1985 ; fujimoto 1988 ) , and does not require incomplete spreading of the fuel or extra mixing .",
    "note however that the discrepancy increases if the neutron star radius is larger than the @xmath206 assumed here ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "i have concentrated on the recurrence time and total burst energy , and have not discussed other properties , such as the peak luminosity or burst duration .",
    "type i bursts from 4u  1820 - 30 generally show radius expansion , in which the luminosity reaches the eddington limit .",
    "kuulkers et al .",
    "( 2003 ) recently surveyed the peak luminosity of globular cluster bursters . for 4u  1820 - 30 , the average peak flux is @xmath208 , or a luminosity @xmath209 for a distance of @xmath210 kpc .",
    "the pure helium eddington limit is @xmath211@xmath212 for @xmath213@xmath214 ( not including general relativistic corrections ) .",
    "when hydrogen is present , the eddington luminosity is reduced by a factor @xmath215 .",
    "however , for small @xmath81 , this change is much less than the uncertainty in the neutron star mass , and so does not allow a determination of hydrogen content .",
    "the durations of bursts from 4u  1820 - 30 are @xmath216@xmath217 ( with exponential decay times @xmath218 ) , consistent with pure helium burning , in which the helium burns rapidly and the burst duration is set by the cooling time of the layer . for solar abundance of hydrogen ,",
    "slow hydrogen burning via the rp process ( wallace & woosley 1981 ) extends the decay time to @xmath219 ( hanawa , sugimoto , & hashimoto 1983 ; wallace & woosley 1984 ; hanawa & fujimoto 1984 ; schatz et al .",
    "however , for @xmath220 , most of the protons are able to burn by direct capture on carbon .",
    "therefore the small amount of hydrogen considered in this paper is not expected to substantially increase the burst duration .",
    "this is something that could be addressed by time - dependent simulations with increasing hydrogen fractions .      in  3",
    ", i used the @xmath50 s determined by matching the type i burst recurrence times to calculate superburst ignition conditions .",
    "for pure he accretion , the expected superburst recurrence times are @xmath221@xmath4 years ( for @xmath66@xmath136 mev per nucleon ) , much less than found by sb02 ( who took @xmath140 ) . if hydrogen is present , the smaller @xmath50 gives recurrence times @xmath222@xmath14 years .",
    "this approach of simultaneously modelling type i bursts and superbursts can be usefully applied to other superburst sources which exhibit regular type i bursts .",
    "a promising candidate is ks  1731 - 260 , for which observations of the quiescent flux constrain @xmath65 ( rutledge et al .",
    "in addition , these results emphasize that determining the superburst recurrence time would strongly constrain the local accretion rate and thermal structure of the star , and thereby composition of the accreted material",
    ".    a direct effect of hydrogen in the accreted material will be to reduce the amount of carbon made during h / he burning . for pure helium accretion , sb02 argued that carbon production occurs during stable burning at high @xmath50 , for which the temperature is low enough to give a high carbon yield ( brown & bildsten 1998 ) .",
    "however , if hydrogen is present , protons will rapidly capture on @xmath77c , initiating the hot cno cycle . in that case ,",
    "breakout reactions @xmath61o@xmath223,@xmath224 and @xmath60o@xmath223,p@xmath225 become possible ( wallace & woosley 1981 ; schatz et al .",
    "1998 ) , depleting the cno abundance , and reducing the carbon yield .",
    "for @xmath122 , there are enough protons for one proton capture on each @xmath77c .",
    "the outcome is probably different for @xmath187 above and below this value , which is within the range predicted by models ( podsiadlowski et al .",
    "2002 ) . for solar abundance of hydrogen ,",
    "schatz et al .  ( 1999 ) found stable burning gave @xmath226% ( still enough to ignite a superburst , however , as cb01 showed ) .",
    "calculations of the carbon production for stable helium burning with a small amount of hydrogen should be carried out .",
    "finally , it has been noted that the superburst from 4u  1820 - 30 is different from the superburst seen in other sources ( kuulkers et al .",
    "it was the most energetic , and is the only superburst so far to reach eddington luminosity .",
    "this is probably due to the low hydrogen abundance in the accreted material .",
    "a lower hydrogen abundance allows greater carbon production , and makes lighter ashes ( the heavy nuclei are probably iron group with @xmath227 rather than rp process ashes with @xmath228 ) reducing the opacity and giving a deeper ignition .",
    "both these effects give a larger nuclear energy release , which could explain the more energetic and luminous superburst .",
    "the calculations described here apply only to the low state , when regular type i bursts are seen , and do not address the disappearance of bursts in the high state .",
    "this is an important question to answer . in spherically - symmetric models ,",
    "burning becomes stable at high @xmath50 s because the temperature - sensitivity of the triple alpha reaction decreases with temperature , and the incoming helium then burns at the rate at which it accretes ( fujimoto , hanawa , & miyaji 1981 ; ayasli & joss 1982 ; taam , woosley , & lamb 1996 ) . however , the transition to stable burning for pure helium accretion occurs at @xmath229 ( b95 ; bildsten 1998 ) , much higher than 1820 - 30 s accretion rate .",
    "the extra nuclear energy release if hydrogen is present will decrease @xmath230 , but not enough to explain the observed transition .",
    "b95 suggested that the missing piece of physics was that the bursts become radiative rather than convective in the high state .",
    "the burning then proceeds as a slowly propagating `` fire '' over the stellar surface rather than dramatic type i bursts .",
    "however , the ignition of a local spot on the surface of the star is not understood , requiring stabilization of pressure gradients , perhaps by rapid rotation ( spitkovsky , levin , & ushomirsky 2002 ; zingale et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "4u  1820 - 30 fits into the pattern of bursting seen in other sources : a transition from frequent , regular bursting to infrequent , irregular bursting as accretion rate increases ( van paradijs , penninx , & lewin 1988 ) . by comparing _",
    "bepposax_/wfc data for 9 frequent bursters ( including 4u  1820 - 30 ) , cornelisse et al .",
    "( 2003 ) concluded that this transition occurs at a universal luminosity @xmath231 .",
    "if this behavior is common to all bursters , two explanations that have been put forward for hydrogen accretors may be relevant for 4u  1820 - 30 .",
    "first , narayan & heyl ( 2003 ) recently studied the linear stability of quasi - steady burning shells , finding that some stable burning occurs during accumulation for accretion rates near the transition to stability . whether this result applies to pure helium accretion should be investigated further .",
    "second , for hydrogen accretors , bildsten ( 2000 ) suggested that the fraction of the star covered with fresh fuel increases with increasing global @xmath11 , so that the local accretion rate @xmath50 _ decreases_. the observed transition is then from mixed h / he ignition ( @xmath97 ) giving frequent , regular bursts to pure he ignition , giving irregular , less frequent bursts ( @xmath232 ) .",
    "the different composition in 4u  1820 - 30 makes it difficult to apply the same explanation , and the regularity of the bursts perhaps implies complete covering .",
    "increasing area with @xmath233 would explain the small change in recurrence time seen by clark et al .",
    "accurate fluence measurements together with spectral fits to the radius as a function of @xmath137 are a way to test this picture .",
