    "since 1970s it is widely believed that quantum chromodynamics should accomodate a richer spectrum than just @xmath13 and @xmath14 resonances , many possible nonconventional structures are suggested , e.g. glueballs ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , ... ) , hybrid mesons ( @xmath17 ) and multiquark states(@xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) .",
    "unfortunately , so far there is still no uncontroversial evidence for nonconventional states experimentally except the hadronic molecules .",
    "the deuteron is a well - known example of hadronic molecule , and the approximate @xmath22 known nuclear levels are all hadronic molecule . in the past few years , many new states have been reported , a striking feature is that some of them are close to the thresholds of certain two hadrons , which inspires the possible interpretation of hadronic molecule .",
    "hadronic molecule is an old idea , about thirty years ago the possible hadronic molecules consisting of two charm mesons are suggested@xcite , and @xmath23 was proposed to be a p wave @xmath24 molecule @xcite . since in general molecule is weakly bound , the separation between the two hadrons in the molecule should be large .",
    "we can picture the two hadrons as interacting via a meson exchange potential @xcite . at large distance ,",
    "one pion exchange is dominant .",
    "guided by the binding of deuteron , tornqvist performed a systematic study of possible deuteronlike two - meson bound states @xcite .",
    "the role of pion exchange in forming hadronic molecules was studied by ericson and karl @xcite .",
    "recently close et al .",
    "@xcite performed a pedagogic analysis of the overall sign , in addition they included the contribution of the `` @xmath10 function '' term which gives a @xmath10 function in the effective potential when no regularization is used . in these original work , only long distance one pion exchange has been considered , and the short distance contributions are neglected . in ref .",
    "@xcite swanson assumed that the short distance dynamics is governed by the one gluon exchange induced constituent quark interchange mechanism , which results in state mixing .    in the model of the nucleon - nucleon interaction ,",
    "the long range part of the nucleon - nucleon force is quantitatively accounted for by the one @xmath25 exchange .",
    "however , the short and intermediate range interactions are governed by more complex dynamics . combining",
    "the well - established one @xmath25 exchange with the exchange of heavier bosons ( e.g. scalar and vector mesons ) to describe the behavior at short distance has been proved to be a very successful approach @xcite .",
    "physically , the scalar and vector meson exchange describes part of multiple pion exchange effects .",
    "for the two @xmath25 exchange , if they interact and correlate in a p wave state , such a exchange can be modeled by @xmath2 exchange . if the two correlated @xmath25 pair is in a s - wave state , durso et al . showed that one can approximate them by the exchange of a scalar @xmath1 meson @xcite .",
    "similarly , the correlated 3 @xmath25 exchange can be approximated by the exchange of one @xmath3 meson .",
    "inspired by the nucleon - nucleon interaction , we shall represent the short distance interactions by the heavier bosons @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 exchange instead of the quark interchange .",
    "the effective potential between two hadrons is obtained by summing over the interactions between light quarks or antiquarks as in the original work @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that one pion exchange between two light quarks results in two terms : the isospin dependent spin - spin interaction and tensor force . after taking into account the heavy bosons exchange , six additional terms",
    "appear including the spin - isospin independent central term , only isospin dependent term , isospin independent spin - spin interaction and tensor force , both isospin dependent and independent spin - orbit interactions .",
    "consequently the situation becomes more complex than the only one pion exchange model . in our model , both the `` @xmath10 function '' term and the s - d mixing effects would be considered , which have be shown to play an important role in the binding @xcite . in this work , we first give a good description of the deuteron in our model , which is an unambiguous hadronic molecule , then apply this formalism to the heavy flavor pseudoscalar - vector ( pv ) systems . thus the predictions for the possible heavy flavor pv molecules are base on a solid and reliable foundation .",
    "this is a greater advantage over other approaches dealing with the dynamics of hadronic molecule , such as one boson exchange in the effective field theory @xcite and residual strong force with pairwise interactions @xcite etc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the formalism of the one boson exchange model is presented , the effective potentials from pseudoscalar , scalar and vector meson exchange are given explicitly . in section iii , we give the meson parameters involved in our model and the boson - quark couplings which are extracted from the boson - nucleon couplings .",
    "the formalism is applied to the deuteron in section iv , the @xmath4 system and the molecular interpretation of x(3872 ) are investigated in section v. we further apply the one boson exchange approach to other heavy flavor pv systems in section vi , and possible molecular states are discussed .",
    "section vii is our conclusions and discussions section .",
    "the expressions for the matrix elements of the spin relevant operators are analytically given in the appendix .",
    "the construction of one - boson exchange interaction is constrained by the symmetry principle . to the leading order in the boson fields and their derivative , the effective interaction lagrangian describing the coupling between the constituent quarks and the exchange boson fields is",
    "as follows @xcite @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the constituent quark mass , @xmath28 is the constituent quark dirac spinor field , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the isospin - singlet pseudoscalar , scalar and vector boson fields respectively . in this work",
    "we take @xmath32 mev , since we concentrate on constituent up and down quarks .",
    "if the isovector bosons are involved , the couplings enter in the form @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively , where @xmath36 is the well - known pauli matrices . for the pseudoscalar",
    ", another interaction term is allowed @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the exchange pseudoscalar mass , this lagrangian has been used by tornqvist @xcite and close @xcite . by partial integration and using the equation of motion , one can easily show that @xmath39 and @xmath40 are equivalent provided the coupling constants are related by @xmath41    from the above effective interactions , the effective potential between two quarks in momentum space can be calculated straightforwardly following the standard procedure . to the leading order in @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the momentum transfer , the potentials are    1 .",

    "the effective potential in configuration space is obtained by fourier transforming the momentum space potential .",
    "@xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "however , the resulting potentials are singular , which contains delta function , so the potentials have to be regularized . considering the internal structure of the involved hadrons ,",
    "one usually introduces form factor at each vertex . here",
    "the form factor is taken as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the so - called regularization parameter , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the mass and the four momentum of the exchanged boson respectively with @xmath64 .",
    "the form factor suppresses the contribution of high momentum , i.e. small distance .",
    "the presence of such a form factor is dictated by the extended structure of the hadrons .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 , which governs the range of suppression , can be directly related to the hadron size that is approximately proportional to @xmath65 .",
    "however , since the question of hadron size is still very much open , the value of @xmath61 is poorly known phenomenologically , and it is dependent on the model and application . in the nucleon - nucleon interaction , the @xmath61 in the range 0.8 - 1.5",
    "gev has been used to fit the data .",
    "for the present application to heavy mesons , which have a much smaller size than nucleon , we would expect a larger regularization parameter @xmath61 . we can straightforwardly obtain the effective potentials between two quarks in configuration space . for convenience ,",
