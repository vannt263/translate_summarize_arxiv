    "one of the main difficulties for the grounding of a platform for quantum technologies is the effect of noise or `` decoherence '' on quantum states .",
    "no physical system is ever truly closed due to interactions with its environment . as a result of such interactions ,",
    "the quantum state of the system will approach classicality , thus ceasing to be of interest for quantum - empowered protocols  @xcite . before being able to create useful quantum technologies , we need to understand these processes , and eventually control them .",
    "an intriguing aspect of decoherence is that , in specific cases ( such as quantum stochastic resonance  @xcite , to throw an example ) , weak decoherence mechanisms give rise to sizeable advantages in , say , the performance of some quantum protocols or the transport of excitations across a quantum medium . such counterintuitive effects are tightly linked to quantum interference phenomena : decoherence changes the way the wave function of a given system evolves in time , thus affecting the occurrence of constructive and destructive interference .",
    " accidental \" constructive effects may be induced , without spoiling the working principle of a given quantum process , for sufficiently weak decoherence mechanisms .",
    "all this is particularly important ( and evident ) in the quantum walk framework  @xcite , whose advantage in terms of the spreading rate of the position of a walker on a given  path \" may be magnified by small degrees of phase noise . in this paper",
    ", we build on the already well established body of research into the behaviour of quantum walks when affected by decoherence , reported for instance in refs .",
    "@xcite and surveyed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "after quickly revisiting the paradigm of quantum walks , we proceed to discuss the protocol under investigation , introducing phase noise and addressing the performance of the scheme for various strengths of such mechanism .",
    "a quantum walk is best described as the quantum analogue of the classical random walk . however , unlike the classical random walk , the evolution of a quantum walk is entirely deterministic .",
    "quantum walks of course allow for superposition states of the walker , enabling them to exhibit interesting behaviours not shown by their classical counterparts . a comprehensive survey of quantum walks , covering both continuous and discrete time variants , and detailing the behaviours of quantum walks on various structures , can be found in ref",
    ".  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus on discrete time quantum walks .    a discrete time quantum walk operates within the hilbert space @xmath1 , where @xmath2  known as the position space  describes the position of the walker on a well - defined structure ( here we shall refer to this structure as the walk s _ terrain _ ) , and @xmath3  known as the coin space  describes an additional degree of freedom affecting the evolution of the walk : this degree of freedom determines the walker s behaviour in the next time step . for the evolution of the walk",
    ", we define two operators : the shift operator , @xmath4 , and the coin operator , @xmath5 .",
    "the shift operator will `` move '' the walker on to a new part of its terrain , depending on the coin state .",
    "for example , if the terrain of a walk is a graph , and the walker is on some vertex of the graph , the shift operator will move it along one of the vertex s edges to another vertex .",
    "the coin operator is analogous to the flipping of a coin in a classical random walk , it will act on the coin space which in turn affects how the walk shall evolve in its terrain when the shift operator is applied .",
    "we move the walker along by one step by applying the coin operator followed by the shift operator ; the state of the walker , starting in some initial state @xmath6 , is thus described after @xmath7 total steps by @xmath8^t { \\left\\vert\\psi(0)\\right\\rangle},\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the identity operator on the position space .",
    "in other words , we apply the coin operator and the shift operator @xmath7 times to the initial walker state .    in order to provide a complete view of the main features of the walk protocol",
    ", we now give some concrete examples of quantum walks .      to represent the walk terrain , a line",
    ", we shall use the set of integers .",
    "the walker can be anywhere on the line , so we give @xmath2 the basis @xmath10 .",
    "as previously described , each step of the walk involves a coin flip and a shift . in the walk on the line ,",
    "the walker has a `` choice '' of two directions , left and right . in the classical random walk , the decision of which direction to walk in at each step is reached by flipping a fair coin .",
    "likewise , in our quantum walk we shall use a coin space of degree two , viz .",
    "@xmath3 is given the basis @xmath11 .",
    "we decide to use the hadamard operator for our coin , as in ref .",
    "this has the effect of putting our walker into a superposition of coin states and will allow for interference to occur during the course of the evolution of the walk . with regards to the walker s behaviour on the terrain , the classical random walk will move one step to the left or one step to the right depending on the most recent coin flip .",
    "the same idea applies for the quantum walk .",
    "we define the shift operator as    @xmath12    ambainis _ et al . _",
    "have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the quantum walk on the line spreads out quadratically faster than the classical random walk on the line .      in general , a graph @xmath13 is specified by fixing a set of vertices @xmath14 along with a set of edges @xmath15 connecting them .",
    "@xmath16-regular graphs are graphs with @xmath16 edges attached to each vertex .",
    "we affix a label @xmath17 to each end of each edge , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ labelled_graph ] * ( a)*. the walker will traverse the graph s vertices , moving along the edges , so we define the position space @xmath2 as having the basis @xmath18 .",

    "we now give @xmath3 the basis @xmath20 .",
    "we then introduce the grover coin @xmath21 which , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , generalises the hadamard coin to hilbert spaces of dimension larger than 2 .",
    "in order for @xmath22 to be unitary , the conditions @xmath23 and @xmath24 have to hold ( with @xmath25 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be changed to vary the behaviour of the walk on the graph .",
    "we shall use a grover coin later on to perform the simulations at the core of our work .    as for the shift operator",
    ", this must take the walker along the appropriate edge to a new vertex , depending on the coin state .",
    "again , we state that this idea is a generalisation of the walk on the line in which we give the walker a choice of @xmath16 directions at each step rather than 2 .",
    "we define our shift operator as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and is labelled @xmath30 on @xmath31 s end , and @xmath32 is the label assigned to the destination node s end of the edge .",
    "the goal of the glued trees ( gt ) algorithm for quantum search is the following : beginning from the left - most vertex of a given gt graph , traverse the graph and reach the right - most vertex , referred to as the target vertex .",
    "childs _ et al . _",
    "@xcite use this algorithm to show quantum walk search to be fundamentally more effective than classical random walk search by presenting a class of graphs ( the gt graphs ) that force classical random walks to make exponentially many queries to an oracle encoding the structure of the graph , but that are traversable by quantum walks with a polynomial number of queries to such an oracle . in order to study the robustness of the algorithm to the detrimental effects of decoherence",
    ", we shall determine how effectively it achieves its goal when subjected to an increasing degree of phase damping noise .",
    "for this reason , we will focus on the probability that the walker is on the target vertex at the end of the walk .",

    ", we compare the behaviour of the walks affected by phase damping ( @xmath54 ) to that which is found for an ideal walk ( corresponding to @xmath55 ) .",
    "it is important to note that the probability depends on the initial coin state . in our study",
    "we have considered walks starting in the initial coin state that maximises the performance of the ideal protocol ( such state also depends on the way in which we label the graph ; in particular , for the labelling scheme that we have mainly used , this corresponds to @xmath56 , with @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) .",
    "however , we have tested different ways of labelling the graph ( and therefore different initial coin states that maximise the walk s performances ) and we have obtained results similar to those presented in the remainder of the paper .    in order to grasp the temporal behaviour of the walk",
    ", we consider the change in the probability distribution of the walker s position on the graph at time @xmath7 . in fig .",
    "[ nodeco ] we illustrate such a probability distribution for an ideal 25-step walk on the gt graph @xmath59 .",

    "we will now focus on the probability of the walker being on particular vertices on the graph and the overall vertex probability distribution for specific time steps . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effect of decoherence on the walk on the hypercube was studied quantitatively .",
    "starting from one corner , a decohered walker will reach the opposite corner in less time than in the ideal walk , hence highlighting a counterintuitive beneficial effect of such an incoherent process .",
    "our goal here is to address similar questions for the walk on a gt graph , as well as to investigate the limits of validity of the claim made in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a lingering effect of a decohered walk on the target vertex was suggested .",
    "we will thus look for the possibility that a decohered walk reaches the target vertex in less steps than the ideal one , and also attempt to determine whether it `` lingers '' on the target vertex for a longer time than in the ideal walk .",
    "here we present and discuss the results of our analysis , showing the behaviour of walks affected by decoherence of variable magnitude .",

    "[ target_over_time ] we plot how the probability of the walker being on the target vertex changes over time for various decoherence magnitudes , ranging from the ideal walk with @xmath60 to a decohered walk with @xmath61 .",
    "we see from this plot that the ideal walk takes 13 steps to achieve its goal of reaching the target vertex , where we say that the walker has reached some vertex @xmath31 on some step @xmath7 of the walk when there is a non - negligible probability of the walker being on @xmath31 on the @xmath62 time step .",
    "the ideal walker first appears on the target vertex on step 13 with probability @xmath63 , then the probability comes to a peak on step 16 with a value @xmath64 before steadily decreasing .",
    "we henceforth refer to the probability that a walker is on some vertex @xmath31 at a time step @xmath7 as @xmath31 s _ vertex probability _ at time step @xmath7 .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ target_over_time ] that , as @xmath53 decreases , the target vertex probability steadily decreases .",
    "the peak on step 16 decreases at a faster rate than the target vertex probabilities associated with steps 13 , 14 , 15 and 17 .",
    "some interesting behaviour can be observed on steps 21 through 27 of the walk .",
    "decoherence magnitude @xmath65 slightly increases the target vertex probability ; in other words , the ideal walker is less likely to be on the target vertex on steps 21 through 27 than the decohered walkers .",

    "decoherence has spread out the range of time steps over which the target vertex probability is large compared to the classical value . in line with the claims in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have indeed found that weak decoherence increases the target vertex probability for an extended number of time steps .",
    "however , when we consider the difference between the @xmath67 and @xmath60 walks on step 22 , we see that the difference between the two target probabilities is very small . in our simulations",
    "we have determined that there is a difference of approximately @xmath68 .",

    "[ target_over_mag ] , as previously discussed , is a plot of the effect of decoherence on the target vertex probability on various time steps .",
    "the curve representing step 16 illustrates the effect of decoherence very well , and confirms the results reported in ref .",

    "@xcite becomes exponentially less effective at achieving its goal as @xmath53 decreases .",
    "we shall now investigate the extent of the `` damage '' that decoherence has on the algorithm s effectiveness .",
    "we concede that as long as the target vertex probability is higher than the other vertex probabilities then the decoherence has not had a particularly damaging effect on the effectiveness of the scheme . on the other hand , if phase damping decreased the peak associated with the target vertex below the other probability peaks then the algorithm would end up in a state involving a more probable `` false - positive '' than a `` positive '' when affected by decoherence  we would say that this is a serious blow to any scheme s usefulness . in fig .",

    "@xcite is not affected to the extent previously described : the walker is never on a non - target vertex with greater probability than the target vertex when allowed to run for sufficient time and phase damping decoherence does not change this fact .        the authors of ref .",

    "we first simulated the walk with no decoherence to find how many steps it took to reach the target vertex ( we say that the walk has reached a vertex when the probability that the walker is on that vertex is non - negligible ) . we then included a range of decoherence magnitudes @xmath73 to see the extent of the drop in the target vertex probability at the end of the walk .",
    "we observed that the ideal walk found the target vertex at time step 13 , with a probability peak at step 16 ( for a gt graph @xmath59 ) .",

    "we also observed that a decoherence magnitude of @xmath65 boosted the target vertex probability very slightly above the ideal walk s ( @xmath60 ) vertex probability on steps 21 through 27 .",
