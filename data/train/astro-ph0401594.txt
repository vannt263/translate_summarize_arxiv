    "hubble space telescope images of the central region of the antennae colliding galaxies ( ngc  4038/4039 ) ( whitmore et al .  1999 ) reveal star - bursting regions which have not only formed single young massive star clusters ( ymc or super stellar clusters , ssc ) but dozens or even hundreds of these star clusters together in confined areas ( knots ) forming actually star cluster complexes .",
    "we refer to these complexes as super - clusters ( kroupa 1998 ) .",
    "one very prominent example is knots . with its age of about @xmath2  myr",
    "it is in a stage where most of the star clusters have already merged in the centre , forming a super stellar cluster spanning several hundred parsec in radius .",
    "the shape of the surface - brightness profile of knots is exponential in the central region and follows a power law in the outer parts .",
    "but these super - clusters are not only found in the centres of strongly interacting and star - bursting galaxies .",
    "they are also found in tidal tails , pulled out from gas - rich interacting galaxies .",
    "furthermore larsen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found an example of such a super - cluster in an ordinary , quiet disc galaxy ( ngc  6946 ) .",
    "this super - cluster contains one very massive ( @xmath3  m@xmath4 ) star cluster and more than a dozen smaller clusters .",
    "all together this object has a mass in stars of about @xmath5  m@xmath4 .",
    "these super clusters are already beyond their gas - expulsion phase and are old enough ( @xmath6  myr ) to be less centrally concentrated if they were simply expanding .",
    "therefore it is very likely that the star clusters inside these objects are bound to each other .",
    "so far no data is available of the velocity dispersion of the clusters in the super - clusters , but the difference of mean radial velocity of two clusters in the same super - cluster in the antennae , measured by mengel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , of about @xmath7  kms@xmath8 is not in contradiction with this assumption .    in a pioneering investigation of the dynamical evolution of such objects , kroupa ( 1998 )",
    "showed that the constituent clusters in these star cluster complexes merge in a few super - cluster crossing - times forming compact spheroidal dwarf galaxies that may have a high specific frequency of globular clusters and capture field stars leading to complex chemical- and age - distributions .    at a recent survey of star clusters and",
    "dwarf galaxies around the central galaxy of the fornax cluster , hilker et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and phillipps et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found small , bright ( absolute @xmath9-band magnitudes of @xmath10 to @xmath11 ) and extended objects , too large for globular clusters and too small for dwarf galaxies .",
    "shape and appearance make these objects very small counterparts to m  32 .",
    "they call them ultra - compact dwarf galaxies with sizes of about @xmath12  pc and effective radii ( half - light radii ) of @xmath13-@xmath14  pc ( drinkwater et al .  2003 ) .",
    "they have velocity dispersions of about @xmath14  kms@xmath8 implying mass to light ratios of @xmath15 to @xmath16 , which leaves no room for dark matter .    in a survey of s0 galaxies",
    "larsen & brodie ( 2000 ) found intermediate aged , faint , metal - rich star clusters ( faint fuzzies ) with large effective radii of greater than @xmath2  pc rotating within the disc .",
    "one of the s0 galaxies has a nearby dwarf companion which could have triggered star formation during a tidal interaction .    in a recent paper bekki et al .",
    "( 2003 ) argue that the ucds could be the cores of dwarf galaxies which got rid of their envelope and dark matter halo due to tidal stripping . according to them",
    "ucds are the cores of destroyed nucleated dwarf galaxies .",
    "still they admit that these cores could have formed out of the merging of several star clusters .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0-cen with its spread in age and metalicity leads to a new formation scenario with @xmath0-cen as an ucd ( zinnecker et al .",
    "1988 , tsuchiya et al .",
    "2003 , bekki & freeman 2003 ) .",
    "according to these authors @xmath0-cen may be the core of a nucleated dwarf galaxy which got stripped of its dark matter halo and the stars in the envelope , placing the `` naked '' core at the position of @xmath0-cen today .",
    "this scenario needs exquisite fine tuning between the orbital shrinkage rate due to dynamical friction and mass - loss from the satellite such that only the core is left without dark matter and stellar envelope .",
    "@xmath0-cen is the most massive globular cluster in the milky way .",
    "it contains about @xmath17  m@xmath4 ( meylan et al .",
    "1995 ) and it orbits the milky way in a slightly inclined ( mostly within the disc ) , retrograde orbit well within the solar radius .",
    "it shows rotation with a maximum rotation speed of @xmath18  kms@xmath8 ( freeman 2001 ) and is slightly flattened .",
    "some observational properties of @xmath0-cen can be found in tab .",

    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the most interesting property of @xmath0-cen is its metalicity and age distribution .",
    "it has a mean metalicity of @xmath19fe / h@xmath20 = -1.68 $ ] ( meylan et al . 1995 ) and exhibits three different metalicity peaks ( hilker & richtler 2000 ) .",
    "but the stars do not only show a spread in metalicity but also in age .",
    "the estimated values for the age - spread vary in the range of @xmath21@xmath22  gyr .",
    "finally the different populations of @xmath0-cen show differences in their spatial distribution and kinematics .",
    "the older metal - poor stars are rotating while the younger metal - rich stars are more centrally concentrated and show no signs of rotation .    while the study reported here agrees with the suggestion that @xmath0-cen is an ucd ( fellhauer & kroupa 2002a , b ) , a different scenario for the formation is proposed .",
    "if a gas - rich dwarf galaxy fell into the milky way during the early build - up phase , this infall could have triggered a local star - burst within the dissolving dwarf forming a star cluster complex ( @xmath1 super - cluster ) .",
    "the star clusters in this super - cluster then merge and form a compact merger - object .",
    "the large age - spread and the spread in metalicities can be accounted for by the capture of an underlying population of old stars , which surround the super - cluster and have the same orbit .",
    "these stars can be leftovers of the destroyed dwarf galaxy which triggered the star burst .",
    "they can not be stars from the milky way disc because of the retrograde orbit of @xmath0-cen .",
    "the relative velocity between the milky way stars and @xmath0-cen is too large to capture them . but",
    "stars from the destroyed dwarf galaxy , having the same overall streaming motion , could be easily captured by the potential well of the newly forming merger - object .",
    "the main difference between this model and the `` standard '' infall model of @xmath0-cen as the stripped core of a dwarf galaxy is that instead of having formed as the core of a dwarf galaxy before the infall , it is formed when the dwarf galaxy falls into the milky way .",
    "@xmath0-cen would be born off - centre , with the surrounding dwarf galaxy in the stage of dissolution .",
    "thus there is no need for the degree of fine - tuning required by the `` standard '' infall model .    in section",
    "[ sec : setup ] the setup of the models is explained followed by a brief description of the simulation code superbox ( fellhauer et al .",

    "the stars have velocities according to the epicyclic approximation , which leaves them unbound to each other but forming a quasi - stable configuration in phase - space .",

    "the medium level grids cover the volume of the super - cluster resolving the forces between the star clusters .",

    "1999 ) , and changing to linear fading at the point where the starburst99 code becomes unreliable ( as described in fellhauer & kroupa 2001a ) , the evolution of the merger - object can be placed into a kormendy diagram .",
    "[ fig : korm ] nicely shows that the model evolves from the most massive super - clusters in the antennae to the approximate location of @xmath0-cen today .",

    "in contrast , the models described here propose that @xmath0-cen has formed when the dwarf galaxy fell into the milky way and got destroyed .",
