    "by far the most abundant nuclei in the universe are hydrogen and helium , still little modified from their primordial ratio of about 12 to 1 by number . of all elements",
    "however the most abundant absorber is helium , because it is far less ionized than hydrogen ; under the hard photoionizing conditions of intergalactic space at redshifts greater than 2 , heii outnumbers hi by a factor @xmath3 of the order of 100 , and has a greater lyman-@xmath1 line opacity by a factor of @xmath4 .",
    "this transition is therefore the most sensitive observational probe of diffuse matter .",
    "helium opacity is measurable almost everywhere  as opposed to hi absorption which over most of redshift space ( between the hi lyman-@xmath1 forest lines ) has a very low optical depth .",
    "heii lyman-@xmath1 absorption occurs in the deep ultraviolet ( 303.8     in the rest frame , four times shorter than hi lyman-@xmath5 ) , and can only be observed from space , in a small number of high redshift quasars which lie by chance on relatively clean lines of sight with little foreground absorption .",
    "three quasars are currently known for which the heii lyman-@xmath1 transition is accessible to _ hubble space telescope _ ( hereafter _ hst _ ) spectroscopy , along with one more quasar at slightly lower redshift which has been observed by the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) .",
    "recent observational progress on heii lyman-@xmath1 studies began with jakobsen et al.s ( 1994 ) discovery of the  heii gunn - peterson effect \" in q0302 - 003 ( @xmath6 ) , followed closely by davidsen et al.s ( 1996 ) higher - resolution hut observation of hs  1700 + 64 ( for which heii at @xmath7 was inaccessible to _ hst _ spectrographs ) , and tytler s and jakobsen s observation ( tytler & jakobsen 1996 ; jakobsen 1996 ) of the faintest of the heii quasars , pks  1935 - 692 ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "these papers established the presence of absorption at low resolution and suggested the increase of the mean opacity with redshift , as expected in models of cosmic ionization .",
    "later , goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) observations of q0302 - 003 ( hogan , anderson & rugers 1997 ; hereafter har97 ) and the brighter quasar he  2347 - 4342 at @xmath8 ( reimers et al .",
    "1997 ) added enough resolution to begin to resolve some features of the helium lyman-@xmath1 forest and to cross - correlate with the absorption observed at the same redshift in hi , allowing studies of matter in the gaps between the hi forest lines .",
    "these data have provided the best constraints on diffuse matter at these redshifts , and estimates of gas density give broad agreement with predictions based on numerical simulations of galaxy formation and extrapolations from the observed hi lyman-@xmath1 forest ( croft et al .",

    "the detection of the  proximity zone \" around q0302 - 003 ( har97 ) also allowed us to deploy a new set of arguments constraining ionizing conditions at those redshifts , giving broad agreement with model expectations ( haardt & madau 1996 ; fardal , giroux , & shull 1998 ) .",
    "the introduction of the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( hereafter , stis ; kimble et al .",
    "1998 ) allows further improvements , including larger spectral range ( allowing study at lower redshift on the same lines of sight ) , better background subtraction ( allowing more precise estimates of high optical depths ) , and better sensitivity ( allowing more precise optical depth estimates and in some cases higher spectral resolution ) .",
    "we have used new stis data together with archival _",
    "hst_/ghrs data to study the faint quasar pks  1935 - 692 in enough detail to detect the hi correlation and the proximity zone , with comparable quality to the ghrs results on q0302 - 003 .",

    "( 1997 ) , supporting the idea that these few lines of sight can be used to draw general conclusions about the cosmic evolution of baryon distribution and ionization .",
    "the new _ hst _ data discussed herein were taken on 23 july 1998 ( ut ) using stis .",
    "the g140l grating and the fuv - mama detector provide good throughput at modest 1.2    spectral resolution , and cover a wide wavelength range of 11501720   .",
    "the 0.2@xmath9 stis slit was chosen as a compromise to limit geocoronal contamination , while still providing good uv throughput .",
    "the spectra were taken in  time - tag \" mode , to eventually allow for even subtle comparisons of data taken during low vs. high background intervals , etc .",
    "however in this initial study , we report merely on the combined observations obtained by summing together the time - tag observations of the july 1998 visit ( i.e. , our initial analysis here treats the stis data as though they were simple ",
    "accum \" observations ) .",
    "the spectra discussed here were processed through the standard stsci / stis data reduction pipeline ; absolute wavelengths should be calibrated to better than 0.6   , with the accuracy of absolute spectrophotometry better than @xmath1010% ( and relative wavelengths and photometry somewhat more accurate ; e.g. , see baum et al .",

    "the pipeline calibrated stis spectrum is shown in figure 1 , overplotted with an error spectrum which assumes @xmath11 statistics ( errors plotted are per pixel , with 2 pixels per 1.2   resolution element ) .",
    "these stis data present a marked improvement over earlier ghrs and faint object spectrograph data on pks  1935 - 692 for a number of reasons : stis has much lower instrumental background which is monitored simultaneously with the science data , excellent uv throughput , capability for efficient target acquisition permitting observations in a small aperture , and as a long - slit device much improved subtraction and monitoring of geocoronal contamination ( e.g. , compare figures 2a and 2b ) .",
    "these aspects are especially important for pks  1935 - 692 , which has the lowest flux near heii of any of the four  heii gunn - peterson \" quasars discussed to date , and because geocoronal lyman-@xmath1 contaminates the spectral region of interest shortward of heii .",

    "a chance superposition of a strong hi lyman limit system causing the absorption break seems unlikely , as our stis spectrum does not reveal any higher order hi lyman series absorption at @xmath15 with hi column density in excess of about 10@xmath1610@xmath17@xmath18 , as would likely be detectable if an unrelated low redshift hi lyman limit system were the cause of the break near 1271   .",
    "the most persuasively identified heii absorption features are those matching redshifts of hi features , including the break and a prominent void ( see below ) .",

    "a very similar shelf was also detected in q0302 - 003 by har97 , and as we argued there such a shelf may plausibly be attributed to a  proximity effect \" , due to the fact that more of the helium is doubly ionized proximal to the hard radiation field of the quasar .    at 1246.5  ",

    "second , the feature is strongly detected in stis data from each of the 5 _ hst _ orbits , examined separately . finally , this feature is also independently seen in a 41,000  s ghrs spectrum of pks  1935 - 692 available from the _ hst _ archive ( see figure 2b ) , and therefore is surely not an instrumental artifact .",
    "( note that the zero - level of the ghrs spectrum in figure 2b is unreliable , as the ghrs data were taken using a @xmath20 aperture and are evidently strongly contaminated by geocoronal lyman-@xmath1 and oi 1302    airglow ) .",
    "blueward of the proximity shelf and recovery void , the flux at @xmath211242    in pks  1935 - 692 is further depressed , which we again attribute ( see also jakobsen et al . 1994 , davidsen et al .",

    "for comparison to the results of various other studies , we estimate that the total heii optical depth toward pks  1935 - 692 outside the quasar proximity zone ( and excluding the void at 1246.5 ) , including both cloud and diffuse contributions is @xmath22 at 95% confidence ( but note the 99% confidence interval includes infinite optical depth ) . here",
    "we have compared the marginally detected mean flux of @xmath23 erg / sec/@xmath24/  averaged over the 12251240    region shortward of the shelf / void , to a representative value of @xmath25 erg / sec/@xmath24/  longward of the break ; the flux longward of the break is estimated from the average flux in the 13051320    region , although this value is also typical of the continuum level over a much broader 13001550    region , as may be seen in figure 1 .",
    "[ if we consider data from all _ hst _ orbits except the second , the mean flux in the 12251240    region is @xmath26 erg / sec/@xmath24/ , and hence @xmath27 . ]",

    "the region blueward of geocoronal lyman-@xmath1 in pks  1935 - 692 may potentially prove of interest with additional data and more sophisticated reductions , but we do not consider it further in this initial study . the strong low - redshift hi lyman-@xmath1 feature at 1583    evident in figure 1 ( see jakobsen 1996 ) might be expected to cause strong hi lyman limit absorption below @xmath30  ",
    ". related @xmath31 lyman-@xmath32 and lyman-@xmath33 absorption is likely present near 1336    and 1266   , respectively , although the former is probably blended with interstellar cii absorption , and the latter hard to interpret in detail as it falls in the proximity shelf and hence is blended with heii absorption .    a more restricted portion of our new pks  1935 - 692 stis spectrum is displayed in figure 3 , to facilitate comparison with simple models for the heii absorption .",
    "following our procedure detailed in har97 , we overlay the observed spectrum with a synthetic spectrum generated from models which assume that the absorption arises entirely from helium in the same clouds that cause the hi lyman-@xmath1 forest absorption . in making these models",
    ", we begin with an optical echelle ctio spectrum of pks  1935 - 692 kindly made available by outram et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and derive hi line lists ( from fitted voigt profiles via vpfit ; webb 1987 ) . then , using the hi line parameters down to a threshold column density of @xmath34  @xmath18 , the hi forest cloud doppler parameters , redshifts , and column densities are used to predict the heii absorption from the same clouds , and the predicted heii absorption degraded to the stis resolution .",
    "we also include in our models the opacity contribution from the strong hi system at @xmath31 ( using an hi column density estimated from applying vpfit to the stis spectrum ) .",
    "the most prominent features of the heii absorption , the major heii break itself near 1271    and the marked void at 1246.5   , are accurately predicted from the hi cloud models .",

    "in addition we note the hint of a correlation with several other observed heii absorption features , in particular a tendency of the heii flux to recover in the voids or gaps between hi lines . with these new results ,",
    "the correlation of some heii features with hi clouds has thus been demonstrated in all three of the heii quasars observed with _",
    "hst _ resolution : q0302 - 003 ( har97 ) , he  2347 - 4342 ( reimers et al . 1997 ) , and pks  1935 - 692 ( this work ) .    correlating the hi and heii absorption yields constraints on the ionizing spectrum , cloud properties and diffuse gas density which can not be deduced from hi absorption alone .",
    "we derive some specific constraints in  4 .",
    "the models displayed in figure 3 assume two constant ratios of heii to hi for all the clouds , @xmath35 , corresponding to a spectral slope @xmath36 ( roughly appropriate near the quasar ) , and @xmath37 ( roughly appropriate to our limit derived below far from the quasar ) .",
    "a change in @xmath3 indeed appears to be required by the data .",

    "( 1997 ) find @xmath38 for typical radio - quiet quasars , but a somewhat steeper spectral slope of @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) for radio - loud objects , and one might roughly estimate @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) from the nearby continuum data displayed in figure 1 for pks  1935 - 692 itself . for such reasons ,",
    "the models displayed in figure 3 are only illustrative .",
    "these models also assume @xmath43 corresponding to pure  turbulent \" broadening , giving the maximal heii / hi optical depth .",
    "the predicted absorption depends sensitively on @xmath44 , as illustrated in figure 4 , which shows the maximal and minimal predicted absorption for @xmath37 and @xmath45 .    for all the models ,",
    "the heii absorption indicates the presence of some additional gas undetected in hi , especially in most of the voids .",
    "of course the gas might be detected in hi with better optical data . because the hi optical depth is so much smaller than that of heii , the model predictions from hi magnify small observed optical depths which are sensitive to noise and to systematic uncertainties such as the continuum level . in this work",
    "we do not attempt a detailed reconstruction of these effects but note that the heii data require diffuse heii absorption from material undetected in hi at the level of the current optical data ( corresponding to @xmath46 0.1 ) , although the amount of this material required differs substantially in various portions of the spectrum .",
    "for example , note in figures 3 and 4 the substantial model flux near 1230    that is not evident in the heii observations .",
    "it is clear that heii data provide the best information about the low - density gas at most redshifts , and this will be true even with much better hi optical data .",
    "the properties of the absorption we find are similar in virtually all respects to those we found for q0302 - 003 , and we interpret our results in parallel with our paper on that quasar .",
    "we summarize the arguments here and the new quantitative results on pks  1935 - 692 ; for a more detailed discussion including the derivations , assumptions , and further references , see the corresponding sections ( noted below ) of har97 .      for several arguments concerning the absorption in the proximity shelf we wish to understand at a rough quantitative level the influence of the quasar on the ionization of the surrounding gas .",
    "pks  1935 - 692 is fainter than q0302 - 003 by a factor of about 0.6 , at close to the same redshift , so estimates of its ionizing influence on the foreground gas scale by this factor .",
    "we assume that the heii ionizing continuum flux ( 228   ) is comparable to that longward of 304   , probably a fair assumption since the heii lyman-@xmath1 emission line , where much of the internally absorbed ionizing continuum would be reradiated , is not strong .",
    "however it is important to allow for the possibility of other sources of absorption much farther along the line of sight , such as an accumulation of hi lyman continuum absorption at lower redshift than the gas in the proximity zone .",
    "suppose absorption reduces the observed 304     flux by a total factor @xmath47 ; conversely , given the observed flux , the flux that would be observed at the continuum edge if unabsorbed increases to @xmath48 , ( or @xmath49 ) .",
    "we assume an intrinsic power law spectral energy distribution @xmath50 where typically @xmath51 .",
    "then , at a wavelength offset @xmath52 from the heii edge we are viewing absorption by heii which sees an ionizing spectral flux from the quasar , @xmath53 and the ionizing photon flux @xmath54 these estimates are for @xmath55 , and differ by factors of order unity for other cosmological models .",
    "we apply this estimate recognizing that uses of the quasar flux for ionization arguments in the following two subsections will be subject to time variability of the source , so it is not possible to calibrate the errors in these estimates precisely .      with this ionizing flux ,",
    "the time it takes to ionize helium in a sphere out to a distance from the quasar corresponding to spectral offset @xmath52 is ( in a flat cosmological model , and ignoring recombinations ) : @xmath56 since this is a plausible lifetime for the quasar , the shelf can be explained as due to the second ionization of the helium by the light of the quasar itself , even if @xmath57 is not much larger than unity .",
    "assume this is the case .",
    "then it may be that the size of the region influenced primarily by quasar ionization is limited by the quasar lifetime , or that the edge is defined by the point at which the quasar light matches the general intergalactic background . in the latter case",
    ", we can use the proximity effect to estimate the background ionizing flux ; in the former case , it gives an upper limit to the background flux .",
    "taking @xmath5820    as the point where the quasar ionizing flux is equal to the ionizing background , the ionizing spectrum has a specific intensity @xmath59 , implying a soft spectrum , with ratio of hydrogen to helium intergalactic ionizing fluxes @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath57 is of the order of unity , this large ratio implies a very soft spectrum , consistent with the idea that breakthrough has not yet been achieved at 228    ( e.g. , reimers et al . 1997 ) ; for consistency with other estimates and models ( e.g. haardt & madau 1996 ) which give @xmath61 , we require @xmath62 , or an observed quasar flux smaller by a comparable factor from its average over the last ionization - response time ( @xmath63 years ) .      in the region near the quasar where its flux dominates the photoionization , we can use estimates of the mean optical depth @xmath64 to estimate the density of diffuse gas .",
    "we use the above estimate (  4.1 ) for the intensity of ionizing radiation at a spectral offset @xmath52 , tied to the observed quasar flux , to give the heii / he ratio .",
    "we assume the standard primordial helium abundance by number @xmath65 to derive a total mass density from @xmath66 .",
    "absorption is computed in the optically - thin limit ( that is , not counting atoms whose absorption is hidden in saturated lines ) and ignoring recombinations ( a valid assumption for low overdensity ) .",
    "relaxing either of these assumptions results in a larger density , so a lower limit to the required overall gas density is @xmath67    this limit may be applied to our data on the proximity shelf in the voids between hi clouds , where the absorption is likely dominated by underdense diffuse gas",
    ". we should adopt @xmath68 in foreground absorption , and an optical depth @xmath641 in the proximity zone ( crudely accounting for the discrete cloud contribution to the opacity ) , to derive a lower limit on @xmath69 .",
    "( the limit is again subject to uncertainty from quasar variability over @xmath70 year timescales , and so can not be precisely calibrated ; to lower the limit however , the quasar in this case would have to have been dimmer in the past , making the large proximity zone discussed in  4.2 even harder to explain ) .",
    "the allowed range for the total baryon density from nucleosynthesis and from low redshift direct measurements is about @xmath71 to @xmath72 ( see fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1998 ) .",
    "thus a substantial fraction of all the baryons is needed in diffuse , optically - thin gas to produce the observed absorption in the near - quasar region .",
    "this also accords with expectations from gravitational - instability models .",
    "note that the  near - quasar region \" extends over about 4,000 km / sec , many correlation lengths , so the distribution of the gas , clouds and dark matter over this region is probably typical of the universe as whole , even if the ionization state is not .",
    "the low-@xmath73 void at 1246.5    in pks  1935 - 692 can be explained as a modest underdensity ( @xmath74 ) of gas , extending over a fairly large interval 3    @xmath75 1000 km / sec .",
    "this type of structure is expected on occasion .",
    "we now turn to results which are pure foreground effects , not dependent on the properties of the quasar .",
    "first , a conservative lower limit on the gas density can be derived from simply assuming that all of the helium is in the form of heii .",
    "this yields @xmath76[(1+z)/4.185]^{-3/2}.\\ ] ] at any given redshift , this is the density implied to achieve an optical depth @xmath64 .",
    "if one considers the integrated contribution of all matter then this applies regardless of saturated lines or thermal broadening , since it simply counts the mean number of atoms needed to achieve a given optical depth and this increases with any saturation . in the gaps",
    "far between identified lines , we know there is still absorption ( beyond the thermal wings of the lines ) and this gives the minimal amount of matter required to produce absorption at those redshifts .    we can reverse this argument if , as observed , some flux is detected far from the quasar .",
    "it is implausible to evacuate gas to a very low density ( e.g. @xmath77 ) by gravitational instability .",
    "if detectable flux gets through then over some redshift intervals the helium is mostly doubly ionized heiii .",
    "there may be unresolved gaps between heiii regions of high opacity but they can fill at most a fraction @xmath78 of the volume where @xmath79 is the smoothed optical depth .",
    "note that reimers et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found evidence in he  2347 - 4342 for large ( 610  ) regions of the spectrum consistent with zero flux ( see figure 5c ) .",
    "if zero - flux regions are large and common then the epoch of heii ionization is being observed .",
    "the fact that no definitive evidence appears for such regions in pks  1935 - 692 ( nor in ghrs spectra for q0302 - 003 ) is consistent with heii ionization being mostly finished .",
    "the differing results for he  2347 - 4342 may be due to real variations in conditions over the limited spectral ( redshift ) regions analyzed thus far , or chance differences between the lines of sight , or to artifacts caused by the imperfect control of backgrounds in ghrs ( e.g. , har97  2 , heap 1997 ) . for example , if we re - reduce the reimers et al .",

    "which mean ghrs background count rates were @xmath80 counts / sec / diode ) , we find more consistency with the spectra of the other two quasars , including a proximity shelf from the quasar itself ( see figure 5d ) . on the other hand , such a re - reduction may also yield a biased estimate of the zero - level , because for ghrs ( unlike stis ) background noise events ( which occur in  bursts \" ) are not measured strictly simultaneously with the on - object counts .",
    "the true situation should be resolved soon with additional stis data on all three quasars .      as in q0302 - 003",
    "and he  2347 - 4342 , we find gaps in the hi forest lines where there is no recovery in the helium spectrum ( e.g. , see figures 34 near @xmath101230 ) .",
    "the ratios of hi and heii optical depths in such ( hi ) gaps can be used to derive the spectral hardness , without knowing the gas density but again assuming primordial abundances . in a conspicuous lyman-@xmath1 void ( e.g. , near @xmath81   ) , the average optical depth of diffuse hi absorption allowed by our current data is about 0.05 .",
    "the optical depth of heii is at least of order unity , requiring @xmath3 @xmath82 , in rough agreement with , e.g. , haardt & madau s ( 1996 ) prediction .",
    "the ratio can be used to constrain the spectrum in the usual way .",
    "this limit and the following can be made more reliable with a better signal - to - noise spectrum of the hi forest .      using this limit on the spectrum ,",
    "we can deduce a limit on the igm density , tied not to the ionizing flux from the quasar ( as we did above ) but to the cosmic ionizing flux at the hi lyman edge , @xmath84 ( in units of @xmath85 ) , which has other observational constraints such as the hi clouds proximity effect .",
    "suppose that there is a smooth density of gas at all redshifts , even in the voids ; the fact that flux gets through on average means that the density can not be too high . calculating the gunn - peterson optical depth for smooth photoionized gas yields @xmath86 as in q0302 - 003 we thus get an upper limit @xmath690.02 by using representative values estimated above of @xmath3@xmath87 and @xmath643 , and using typical estimates @xmath88 ( haardt & madau 1996 )",
    "the assumptions leading to this limit are conservative in most respects .",
    "modest density perturbations lead to more recombinations , therefore more absorption for a given mean density .",
    "it is true that the absorption per atom is reduced in highly saturated lines , but we know that the saturated material is dominated by the clouds already detected in the hi lines",
    ". therefore , material between the identified hi forest clouds can not be repository for a large number of baryons far in excess of the nucleosynthesis value of @xmath89 . since helium is an inert gas , this argument applies even to models where the hydrogen is locked up in molecular or solid form .",
    "there is broad consistency with a picture in which some helium absorption occurs in the same clouds giving rise to the hi lyman-@xmath1 forest , but with additional helium absorption by material with @xmath90 that is essentially similar to the hi forest clouds , albeit at a lower density and filling a substantial fraction of the space between them .",
    "the total amount of material in this latter form is comparable to , but possibly somewhat smaller than , that in the clouds ; it is certainly not much greater .",
    "these constraints on the overall distribution of baryonic material can not be derived on the basis of the hydrogen data alone , although they agree with the expectations for the baryon density derived from nucleosynthesis , and with the gravitational - instability formation model of the clouds .",
    "this overall picture is consistent for all three currently known quasars where heii lyman-@xmath1 is observable with _ hst _ , and therefore may be representative of the universe generally at @xmath91 .",

    "<S> we present a new _ hst_/stis spectrum of the @xmath0 quasar pks  1935 - 692 and summarize the spectral features shortwards of 304    in the rest frame likely to be caused by foreground heii lyman-@xmath1 absorption . in accord with previous results on two other quasars at similar redshifts , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate a correlation with the hi lyman-@xmath1 forest absorption , and show that much of the helium absorption is caused by a comparable quantity of more diffuse gas with @xmath2 , that is not detected in hi . the helium ionization zone around the quasar </S>",
    "<S> is detected as well as a void seen in both hi and heii . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the absorption are in broad agreement with those of the other quasars and with models of the protogalactic gas distribution and ionization at this redshift .    </S>",
