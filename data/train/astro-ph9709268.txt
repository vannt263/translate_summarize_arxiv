    "the analysis of the phase - space distributions of cluster galaxies helps to constrain models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "in particular , it is important to distinguish among galaxies of different luminosities and morphological types , as they may not have formed and evolved in the same way .",
    "moreover , it is important to know the phase - space distributions of different cluster galaxies for a proper determination of the cluster mass ( girardi et al .",
    "1996 ) .    the observational evidence that early - type galaxies occupy denser environments than late - types dates back to curtis ( 1918 ) and hubble & humason ( 1931 ) , and was quantified by oemler ( 1974 ) .",
    "melnick & sargent ( 1977 ) showed that the relative fraction of s0 and spiral galaxies depends on the distance from the cluster centre .",
    "most subsequent studies were based on the data sample of dressler ( 1980a ) containing over 6000 galaxies in 55 cluster fields . while dressler ( 1980b ) concluded that the basic correlation is between morphology and _ local density _ in clusters , sanroma & salvador - sole ( 1990 ) and whitmore & gilmore ( 1991 ) , based on the same sample ,",
    "have independently reached the conclusion that the fundamental correlation is between morphology and _ global cluster properties , _ such as the the clustercentric distance . for more complete reference",
    ", we refer the reader to whitmore et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .",
    "more recently , ellipticals and s0 were found to have smaller velocity dispersions ( @xmath1 in the following ) than spirals and irregulars ( tammann 1972 ; melnick & sargent 1977 ; moss & dickens 1977 ; sodr et al .",
    "1989 ; biviano et al .",
    "1992 , hereafter b92 ; stein 1997 , hereafter s97 ) .",
    "as morphologies are usually more difficult to reliably determine than colours , and colours and morphologies are correlated , many authors have analysed the correlation between kinematics and colours .",
    "andreon ( 1996 ) , biviano et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , colless & dunn ( 1996 ) , all found that the ratio between the @xmath1 of the blue and the red galaxy populations in the coma cluster is @xmath21.4 .",
    "similar evidence has recently been found by carlberg et al . (",
    "1997 ) in their analysis of the cnoc survey medium - z clusters . based on a sample of @xmath3 galaxies in 15 clusters ,",
    "s97 has recently confirmed the larger @xmath1 for spirals as compared to early - type galaxies , and has shown that within the class of early - type galaxies , s0 have a larger @xmath1 than ellipticals .",
    "further , possibly related , observational evidence is the existence of luminosity segregation : the most luminous galaxies are closer to the cluster centres ( e.g. rood & turnrose 1968 , capelato et al .",
    "1981 , yepes et al .",
    "1991 ) , and have a significantly lower velocity dispersion ( rood et al . 1972 ,",
    "chincarini & rood 1977 , struble 1979 , kent & gunn 1982 , b92 , s97 ) .",
    "the anti - correlation between luminosity and velocity dispersion seems however to hold for the very bright galaxies only ( luminosity @xmath4 ) , and to depend on the galaxy morphological type , being strongest for ellipticals ( b92 , s97 ) .",
    "s97 in particular has pointed out that there is no evidence whatsoever for a @xmath1luminosity ( anti-)correlation in galaxies other than ellipticals .",
    "only very recently , large data - sets have allowed the analysis of the velocity dispersion profiles ( _ vdp  _ in the following ) of galaxies of different properties .",
    "mohr et al . (",
    "1996 ) have shown that the emission - line galaxies in the a  576 cluster have a steeper _ vdp  _ than non - emission - line galaxies ; biviano et al .",
    "( 1997 , hereafter b97 ) have come to the same conclusion on the basis of the enacs data - set of 75 clusters ( see katgert et al .",
    "1996 , hereafter k96 ) .",
    "a similar difference is found between the _ vdp  _ of red and blue galaxies in 15 clusters from the cnoc survey ( carlberg et al .",
    "1997 ) .    from the theoretical side , the evidence for segregation is interpreted either as arising in a different formation process for galaxies of different luminosities and/or morphologies , or as being due to a different evolutionary history ( the `` nature vs. nurture '' problem ) .",
    "many physical processes can affect the morphology , luminosity , and velocity of a galaxy .",
    "dynamical friction can slow down the more massive galaxies , circularize their orbits ( den hartog & katgert 1996 and references therein ) , and enhance their merger rate ( mamon 1992 , 1996 and references therein ) ; ram pressure and collisions can transform a star forming galaxy into a quiescent one ; tidal effects can truncate the galaxy sizes and reduce their luminosities while producing a reservoir of debris for centrally located cd galaxies ( oemler 1992 , whitmore 1994 , and references therein ) .",
    "the steep _",
    "vdp  _ and large @xmath1 of star - forming galaxies , as compared to quiescent ones , suggests that star - forming galaxies are falling into the cluster , maybe for the first time ( b97 ) .",
    "in this paper we revisit these issues , via the analysis of a large data - set of about 2000 cluster galaxies , partly based on the enacs catalogue ( k96 , katgert et al .",
    "1997 ) , and partly drawn from the literature .",
    "taking a step further from previous studies on segregation , we distinguish spirals into two classes ( early- and late - type ) , and determine the _",
    "vdp  _ of ellipticals , s0 , early - spirals and late - spirals .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in   2 we describe the data - sample , in   3 we address the issues of segregation in velocities and spatial segregation , and determine the _",
    "vdp  _ for different morphological classes ; in   4 we discuss our findings , and in   5 we give our conclusions .",
    "the data sample on cluster galaxies which we use in this paper is a merging of the enacs data - base ( k96 and katgert et al .",
    "1997 ) and available data from the literature , which includes the december 1994 version of zcat ( huchra et al .",
    "1995 ) . coordinates and redshifts are available for all galaxies in our data sample , and magnitudes and morphological types are available for most of them .    in compiling this data - base , we had to make a compromise between collecting as much data as possible , and keeping the data - base homogeneous .",
    "for this reason , before putting together data from different sources , we first compared the different redshift estimates for galaxies common to different data - sets . only when the average velocity difference of all common galaxies was not statistically significant ( at the 90  % confidence level ) and less than 200  km  s@xmath5 , were the different source redshift scales considered compatible and the data - sets merged together .",
    "for a comparison of enacs and literature data we refer the reader to k96 .    in merging different data - sets , one has to take special care not to insert the same galaxy twice .",
    "this may happen if the galaxy coordinates in either of the two data - sets are not accurate enough .",
    "for the enacs clusters , we made use of the ( unpublished ) catalogue of galaxies obtained by scanning film copies of the serc blue survey and glass copies of the first palomar sky survey , with the _ astroscan _ measuring machine ( k96 and references therein ) .",
    "this catalogue was used in preparing the optopus observations ; for all detected galaxies a photometric parameter was derived , which was later converted into an isophotal magnitude ( @xmath6 ) using ccd - observations for calibration ( more details are given in k96 ) .",
    "this photometric catalogue is meant to be complete , but only for selected cluster regions specifically chosen for the optopus observations . when a galaxy with a redshift measurement from the literature was located in the optopus plate cluster regions , it was possible to find a corresponding entry in the _ astroscan _ catalogue .",
    "if the galaxy already had an enacs redshift measurement , this was adopted ; otherwise , the literature redshift was used , but the coordinates and magnitudes were taken from the _ astroscan _ catalogue , for a better consistency with other enacs galaxies .    for the non - enacs clusters , or for regions of the enacs cluster not covered by the optopus plates , we took a conservative approach and rejected all suspected double entries for the same galaxy .",
    "the decision was based upon similarity of coordinates ( up to 30 \" difference ) , and galaxy properties like redshift , and/or magnitude , and/or morphology .",
    "we may have eliminated galaxy pairs , but this is not a concern for the present analysis , as long as the probability for galaxies to be in pairs does not depend strongly on their morphological type and/or luminosities .",
    "the average galaxy velocity uncertainty in our final data - set , using the errors quoted in the original references , is 69  km  s@xmath5 , and the maximum quoted uncertainty is 276  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "external errors are likely to be larger , due to the non - perfect match of the redshift scales of merged data - sets",
    ".    magnitudes were corrected for galactic absorption , using the extinction - maps of burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) , and the relations between @xmath7 and absorption in several magnitude bands as given by colless ( 1989 ) , oemler ( 1974 ) , and postman & lauer ( 1995 ) .",
    "we applied k - corrections using the relations given by colless ( 1989 ) , postman & lauer ( 1995 ) , sandage ( 1973 ) , and schneider et al .",
    "all magnitudes were then converted to enacs @xmath6 magnitudes .",
    "when possible , the linear regression between the enacs and the literature magnitudes for common galaxies was used as a conversion formula . otherwise , we used relations given in the literature to convert from total to isophotal magnitudes , when needed , and from different bands to the red bandpass ( ref.s mentioned above and : dickens et al .",
    "1986 , lugger 1989 , oegerle & hoessel 1989 , and sharples et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "the uncertainty of enacs magnitudes is @xmath8  mag ( and even lower for galaxies in clusters with ccd - calibration , see k96 ) .",
    "the uncertainty of the magnitudes taken from the literature is probably larger ( @xmath9  mag ) , because of the additional error introduced in transforming them to the enacs bandpass .",
    "all the morphological type estimates were taken from the literature , as there is no morphological information available in the enacs data - set .",
    "several methods have been proposed in the literature for defining cluster membership . as",
    "a large part of our data comes from enacs , it would be natural to follow k96 s methodology of fixed gaps : redshift boundaries for a cluster are defined such that the closest non - cluster member in redshift space is separated by at least 1000  km  s@xmath5 from either of the two boundaries .",
    "however , a fixed gap of 1000  km  s@xmath5 is a valid choice only for the relatively homogeneous enacs sample , but can not work for all data - sets , simply because the average density of observed galaxies per redshift interval may change ( as a consequence of one survey being deeper than another ) . as an example , the fixed gap fails to effectively identify the coma cluster in redshift space .    for this reason",
    ", we adopted a gap that depends on the galaxy density per redshift interval along the line - of - sight to a given cluster , and we call it the density - gap , equal to @xmath10  km  s@xmath5 , where @xmath11 is the total number of galaxies with measured redshift in the cluster region .",
    "this expression was derived from simulations of the occurrence of gaps of a given size in gaussian distributions with varying numbers of objects . when applied on the enacs data - base it identifies similar systems as those identified using the fixed gap criterion ( see also adami et al .",
    "1997a ) .    using the density - gap method we identified the main systems along the lines of sight .",
    "for the cluster a  548 alone we also applied a splitting in coordinate space , since it is clearly bimodal in projection ( escalera et al .",
    "1994 ) .    in order to further reject possible remaining interlopers",
    ", we then applied the method of den  hartog & katgert ( 1996 ) to the systems with at least 50 galaxies ( the method is unreliable for poorer data - sets ) .",

    "centres were defined by choosing the peak of the x - ray emission , when available , or the location of the cd , when present , or else the isodensity contour peak ( as in adami et al .",

    "( 1993 ) have shown that changing the cluster membership criterion changes the cluster @xmath1 estimate if only 10 galaxies per cluster are available . as a consequence , we considered in our analysis only those clusters with at least @xmath55 galaxy members within a circle of 1  h@xmath5  mpc radius ( the minimum number of cluster galaxies in our sample is 18 , in the cluster a  978 ) .",
    "the final sample contains 1997 galaxy members from 40 nearby clusters ( counting the subclusters in a  548 as two independent systems ) .",
    "the mean cluster redshifts range from 0.013 to 0.075 ; the absolute r@xmath56 magnitudes of cluster galaxies range from -23 to -16 ; the morphological fractions of the 1997 galaxies are : 24  % ellipticals ( e , hereafter ) , 49  % s0 , 21  % early spirals ( sa to sb in the hubble sequence , globally labelled se , hereafter ) , and only 6  % late spirals or irregulars ( sl , hereafter ) .",
    "these fractions are similar to the average fractions for all kinds of clusters ( spiral poor , spiral rich and cd ) as given by oemler ( 1974 ) .    in table  1",
    "we list for each system the cluster abell number , the number of very bright galaxies ( i.e. those with a cd morphology and those separated by a gap of at least 0.5 mag from the fainter galaxies ) , the total number of redshifts , the mean redshift of the cluster , the clustercentric distance that defines the region analysed in this paper , the velocity dispersion and its bootstrap error based on 1000 resamplings , the type of the selected centre ( `` i '' means the centre was chosen at the isodensity peak , `` cd '' that it coincides with the position of the cd galaxy , `` x '' that it coincides with the position of the x - ray peak ) , and the relevant references to the collected data .",
    "while this paper was being written , the data - set of stein ( 1996 ) on cluster galaxies became available .",
    "as this data - set is not included in our compilation , it makes sense to compare stein s determinations of the cluster parameters with ours .",

    "we find an average difference of 37  km / s in the @xmath1 estimates , and of -122  km / s in the average velocity estimates , both within their 1-sigma uncertainties .",
    "our results are based on the analysis of a synthetic cluster that we have created by joining all 40 cluster samples ( as in b92 ; see also b97 and s97 ) . in the synthetic cluster ,",
    "galaxy distances are in unit of h@xmath5  mpc from the centre of the cluster they belong to .",
    "galaxy absolute magnitudes , @xmath57 , are obtained from apparent magnitudes by using the mean cluster distances , and galaxy velocities are referred to the cluster average velocities and scaled by the cluster velocity dispersions , @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are , respectively , the galaxy and the cluster indices .    in order to check the results obtained on the synthetic cluster , the same analysis was also performed on a single cluster , coma ( a  1656 ) , for which a large enough data - sample was available .",
    "the morphological fractions of coma galaxies are similar to those of the synthetic cluster .    in all following analyses ,",
    "error - bars are obtained from a bootstrap technique with 1000 resamplings .      in order to test for the presence of luminosity segregation in velocity space ,",
    "we have computed the ( normalised ) velocity dispersion , @xmath61 , of the synthetic cluster for galaxies of different ( absolute ) magnitude , without making any distinction according to the morphological type . in fig .",
    "1a we plot @xmath61 vs. mag using 0.5-mag bins ; it can be seen that the velocity dispersion is roughly independent of magnitude for @xmath62 but monotonically decreases at brighter magnitudes , from @xmath63 at @xmath64 , to @xmath65 at @xmath66 .",
    "the difference between the velocity dispersions for galaxies brighter and , respectively , fainter than @xmath64 is significant at the 0.999 confidence level , according to an f - test .",
    "galaxies brigther than this magnitude limit are moving more slowly than other cluster galaxies .",
    "while it is well known that most cd and d galaxies sit at the bottom of their cluster potential wells , there are at most 31 such galaxies in our sample ( see table  1 ) , as compared to 166 galaxies brighter than @xmath64 ; this effect thus concerns the 4 brightest galaxies of each cluster on average .",
    "this segregation in the velocity space may be interpreted as evidence that the brightest cluster galaxies have reached energy equipartition as a consequence of dynamical friction ( e.g. capelato et al .",
    "1981 ) . for a constant galaxy",
    "mass - to - light ratio , energy equipartition implies @xmath67 . for @xmath68",
    "this relation is consistent with our data : the regression line between @xmath69 and @xmath57 , has a slope of @xmath70 . the same relation ( normalized at @xmath64 )",
    "is also shown superposed on the data points in fig .",
    "in order to analyse the dependence of luminosity on the galaxy morphological class , we have repeated the previous analysis on the three subsamples of e , s0 and se@xmath71sl ( early- and late - spirals and irregulars are considered together to avoid poor statistics ) .",
    "the @xmath1-magnitude relation for e is similar to that for all galaxies together ( see fig .",
    "2a ) , and the @xmath61 of e brighter than @xmath64 is significantly lower than the @xmath61 of fainter e ( 0.99 confidence level , according to an f - test ) . on the other hand ,",
    "this magnitude dependence is not found for the galaxies of other morphological classes .",
    "we then computed @xmath61 separately for e , s0 , se and sl of all luminosities ( see fig .",
    "in general , later morphological type galaxies have a larger velocity dispersion than early type galaxies , although there is no significant difference between the s0 and the se @xmath1 .",
    "the e @xmath1 is 15  % lower than the s0@xmath71se @xmath1 , and the latter is 20  % lower than the sl @xmath1 .",
    "an f - test qualifies these differences as significant at more than 0.999 confidence level .",
    "we have then considered the coma ( a  1656 ) cluster independently . in order to achieve a higher signal - to - noise , we used in this case bins of 1  mag , instead of 0.5  mag .",
    "we do not need to consider normalized velocities in this case , as all galaxies belong to the same cluster .",
    "similarly to what was found for the synthetic cluster sample , in the coma cluster there is evidence for both luminosity and morphology - based segregation in velocity ( see fig .  3 ) . in this case",
    "however , the velocity dispersion seems to monotonically increase with magnitude up to the fainter magnitude bin , where @xmath72  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the difference between the @xmath1 of galaxies in the brightest magnitude bin and that of galaxies in the adjacent magnitude bin , is consistent with the energy equipartition model , but the global trend is not .    as far as the morphological segregation is concerned , in general later types",
    "seem to have larger @xmath1 , but the only significant difference is between the @xmath1 of e and the @xmath1 of other galaxies .      in the analysis of the spatial segregation , we have to take into account the fact that our sample is not magnitude complete .",
    "magnitude incompleteness is not a problem for the analysis of segregation in velocity , since velocities and magnitudes of cluster galaxies are mostly uncorrelated . on the other hand ,",
    "observational biases may induce a spurious variation of the average galaxy magnitude with clustercentric distance that may be taken for evidence of spatial luminosity segregation .",
    "in particular : ( i ) the limiting magnitude of galaxies selected for observations with multi - fiber spectroscopy is generally brighter in fields of higher galaxy density ( i.e. in the cluster centres ) ; ( ii ) deep observations generally only cover small fields of view , i.e. the cluster centres and not the wider external regions . note however that the two biases result in opposite selection effects .",
    "we think that these biases do not seriously affect our analysis for the following reasons : ( i ) the enacs sample ( which constitutes a large part of our sample ) is free of these observational biases ( katgert et al .",
    "1997 ) ; ( ii ) our analysis is limited to the inner cluster regions , where the sampling may be less inhomogeneous ; ( iii ) the combination of several samples is likely to further reduce the problem , unless all samples are biased the same way .    in fig .",
    "4 we plot the average magnitude vs. clustercentric distance .",
    "note that the total number of galaxies per bin ranges from 92 to 316 , large enough to provide an adequate sampling of the luminosity function at the bright end .",
    "galaxies in the central bin are clearly brighter than those in the adjacent bin . in other bins",
    "the magnitude decreases towards the outer parts of the ( synthetic ) cluster .",
    "it is difficult to see how observational biases can produce an artificial decrease of the magnitude with increasing clustercentric distance , while leaving , at the same time , an opposite trend just in the very centre of a cluster .",
    "it is possible that a real effect , spatial segregation of the very bright galaxies , is seen superposed on a more general trend that is created by an observational bias .",
    "the evidence for spatial segregation must however be considered as tentative only .",

    "not surprisingly so , since most cluster galaxies are e and s0 . there are notable differences among the _ vdp  _ of the different classes :    * the late - type galaxies have a decreasing _ vdp  _ in the centre , while the early - type galaxies have an increasing _ vdp  _ out to 0.2  h@xmath5  mpc ; * the _ vdp  _ of e , s0 and se are similar for distances @xmath78  h@xmath5  mpc , and nearly flat , while the sl _",
    "vdp  _ is different and decreasing .",
    "interpreting these differences requires some modelling of the _ vdp  _ .",
    "we have fitted the _",
    "vdp  _ using simple kinematical models in which we take into account the 3d galaxy distribution , as obtained from the king profiles ( see   3.2 ) , and in which we allow the radial velocity profile to vary linearly with clustercentric distance , while the anisotropy , @xmath79 , is allowed to vary only when a constant anisotropy model could not provide a reasonable fit .",
    "we found that the steep rise of the e _",
    "vdp  _ requires a substantial degree of tangential anisotropy in the centre ( @xmath80 ) and more or less isotropic orbits outside 0.20.3  h@xmath5  mpc .",
    "the same is true for the s0 _ vdp  _ , although in this case only a modest tangential anisotropy is needed in the cluster centre ( @xmath81 ) . on the other hand , both the se and the sl _",
    "vdp  _ are sufficiently well fitted by constant anisotropy models ( with decreasing radial velocity dispersion with radius ) , with @xmath82 for se , and @xmath83 for sl .",
    "based on a data - set of @xmath84 galaxies in 40 abell clusters , we have found that the galaxy phase - space distributions depend on the galaxy morphological types and luminosities .",
    "these results are based on a synthetic cluster , generated by combining all available cluster samples , and also on the coma cluster sample alone , for which enough data are available to allow such an analysis .",
    "both the galaxy velocity dispersion and the average clustercentric distance are smaller , on average , for earlier type galaxies ; galaxies brighter than @xmath64 have a smaller velocity dispersion than the other cluster galaxies , and the average magnitude of galaxies within 0.1  h@xmath5  mpc from the cluster centre is @xmath85  mag lower than the average magnitude of the other cluster galaxies ( although the statistical significance of this last result is not well established , as it may be biased by the incompleteness of our sample ) . note that the decrease of @xmath1 with magnitude only concerns e.    these findings confirm previous ones : the evidence for morphological segregation dates back to curtis ( 1918 ) and humason et al .",
    "( 1956 ) , with regards to the spatial distribution , and to tammann ( 1972 ) , melnick & sargent ( 1977 ) , and moss & dickens ( 1977 ) with regards to the velocity distribution .",
    "the evidence for luminosity segregation dates back to rood & turnrose ( 1968 ) , with regards to the spatial distribution , and to rood et al .",
    "( 1972 ) with regards to the velocity distribution ( see   1 for reference to more recent works ) .",
    "the large size of our data - set has allowed us to go beyond these early results and get a better insight into these topics :    1 .   within the spiral class ,",
    "we have considered separately early - spirals and late - spirals @xmath71 irregulars , and have shown that their distributions are different .",
    "we have combined the spatial and velocity distributions to determine the _ vdp  _ of each morphological class , and have shown that they are different .",
    "modelling of these _ vdp  _ has allowed us to show that the e and s0 orbits are predominantly tangential in the cluster core , and isotropic outside , while se and sl orbits have some degree of radial anisotropy ( more marked for sl ) .",
    "the central 3d velocity dispersions ( in normalized units ) are 1.4 , 1.8 , 2.1 and 2.4 for e , s0 , se and sl respectively , and the sl 3d-@xmath1 is larger than the e , s0 and se 3d-@xmath1 at all radii . the se and sl _",
    "vdp  _ are steeper than the e and s0 _ vdp  _ ; a peaked density profile can produce a steep _ vdp  _ ( den hartog & katgert 1996 ) , but in our sample we see the opposite , late - type galaxies are characterized by _ flatter _ density profiles and at the same time _ steeper _ _ vdp  _ than early - type galaxies",
    ". more likely , the different morphological - type populations do not share the same dynamical status : if s0 are the virialized cluster population , the fact that the sl kinetic energy is almost twice the s0 kinetic energy in the cluster centre indicates that sl are a bound yet not virialized cluster population .",
    "their radial anisotropy then suggests that sl may be falling into the cluster for the first time , similarly to what has been suggested for narrow - angle - tail radio sources ( odea et al .",
    "these conclusions recall those of b97 about emission - line galaxies , and those by tully & shaya ( 1984 ) about spirals in the virgo cluster .    on the other hand , the low velocity dispersion of e , their tangential anisotropy , and their central location , are all suggestive of a phase - space distribution modified by the process of dynamical friction ( den hartog & katgert 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , if the mass - to - light ratio of cluster galaxies is not a steep function of their luminosities , it is easy to show that the timescale of the dynamical friction process is @xmath86  gyr for @xmath68 ellipticals in the cluster core ( sarazin 1986 ) .",
    "consistently with this scenario , faint e ( @xmath87 ) , i.e. those less affected by the process of dynamical friction ( assuming they are also less massive ) , do not share the same _ vdp  _ as bright e , their orbits being more isotropic and their _",
    "vdp  _ more isothermal ( a different kinematics for bright and faint galaxy in the coma cluster was already suggested by biviano et al .",
    "our analysis of the phase - space distributions of @xmath84 cluster galaxies has shown that they differ according to the galaxy luminosities and morphological types .",
    "we have interpreted these differences as evidence that the elliptical phase - space distribution is evolving towards energy equipartition ( e.g. capelato et al . 1981 ) , while , at the other extreme , the late spirals are still falling into the cluster for the first time ( e.g. melnick & sargent 1977 , moss & dickens 1977 , b97 ) .",
    "the phase - space distributions of s0 and early spirals are intermediate between these two extremes .",
    "these findings constrain theories of cluster formation and evolution , as they suggest an ongoing evolution of the cluster population through the process of dynamical friction and of secondary infall .",
    "the comparison of the phase - space distributions of distant cluster galaxies with local ones is needed to shed light on this topic .",
    "observations with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( e.g. dressler & smail 1997 ) and/or accurate spectroscopy on 8  m class telescopes should make such a comparison feasible soon .    we wish to thank dr .",
