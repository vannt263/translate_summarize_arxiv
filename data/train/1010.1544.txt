    "the rotatable willi detector @xcite , shown in fig.[willi ] . is a modular system , each module being formed by a scintillator layer , 3 cm thickness in al frame , 1 cm thickness , operating for all azimuth angles and down to 45@xmath1 zenith inclination .",
    "the detector permits the measurement of the energy deposited by traversing muons and additional , for muons stopped in the detector , the moment of decay up to 50 @xmath2s .",
    "the active layers of the detector are plates of scintillators of 1 m@xmath3 which are read by two photomultipliers mounted on opposite corners of each plate , using alternatively corners .",
    "the main aim of willi detector is to determine the muon charge ratio by measuring the life time of stopped muons in the detector layers : the stopped positive muons decay with a lifetime of 2.2 @xmath2s , while negative muons are captured in the atomic orbits , leading to an effectively smaller lifetime depending on the stopping material .",
    "the muon charge ratio is determined from the measured decay curve of all muons stopped in the detector , by fitting the measured decay spectrum with the theoretical curve .",
    "the simulations of the eas have been performed with corsika program @xcite , based on six different models for the description of the high - energy hadronic interaction : dpmjet ii.5 @xcite , qgsjet @xcite , venus @xcite , sibyll @xcite and three different models for the description of low - energy hadronic interaction : gheisha @xcite , urqmd 1.1 @xcite and dpmjet , which includes some extensions allowing the simulation of hadronic interaction down to 1 gev ; the threshold is set by default to elab = 80 gev / n .",
    "the local geomagnetic field is included in corsika in the approximation of homogeneous field , as described by the international geomagnetic reference field for the year 2000 @xcite . the geomagnetic cutoff is calculated with a monte carlo procedure of the possible particle trajectories in the back - tracking method , enabling the calculation of a table of allowed and forbidden trajectories @xcite",
    ". the particle tracking is based on geant 3.21 , @xcite starting at 112.83 km , the top of the atmosphere as defined in corsika .",
    "in view of detailing geomagnetic effects , the muon fluxes have been calculated @xcite for two different locations with different magnetic cutoff : hiroshima ( 34@xmath1 n , 132@xmath1 e ) with the geomagnetic cutoff 11.6 gv and bucharest ( 44@xmath1 n , 26@xmath1 e ) with geomagnetic cutoff of 5.6 gv @xcite .",
    "fig.[flux ] ( left ) compares for bucharest and hiroshima the muon flux calculated with corsika with the semi - analytical formulae of nash @xcite and geiser @xcite .",
    "we see that at low muon energies ( @xmath0 1 gev ) the muon flux is significantly influenced by the geomagnetic field and dependent on the particular observation site , and from the direction of muon incidence . the muon flux for incident energies @xmath0",
    "1 gev was compared with corsika simulations using dpmjet and qgsjet2 models for hadronic interactions , see fig.[flux ] ( right ) .",
    "the simulated data for atmospheric muons obtained with corsika code , using both dpmjet and qgsjet interaction models , are in good agreement with measured data of willi detector for the whole azimuth range and a mean zenith angles of 35@xmath1 .",
    "the charge ratio r@xmath4(@xmath5/@xmath6 ) of the atmospheric muons provides a sensitive test of the simulation of the fluxes as different charges have different path lengths from the production level to the detector , and consequently the decay probability for low - energy muons is modified .",
    "this influence leads to the latitude effects of the flux and to the so - called east west effect @xcite , which is more pronounced at lower muon energies and with larger observation angles , see fig.[charge_ratio ] ( left ) .    for the investigation of the azimuthal dependence of the charge ratio of atmospheric muons ,",
    "a series of measurements @xcite has been performed on four azimuth directions of incidence of the atmospheric muons : north , east , south , west , ( n , e , s , w ) for muons with inclined incidence , mean value at 35@xmath7 and mean incident energy 0.5 gev / c .",
    "the results are displayed in fig.[charge_ratio ] ( right ) .",
    "the good agreement between the measurements and simulations data indicates that corsika code describes well the azimuth variation i.e. the east - west effect observed by willi .",
    "the okayama group reported less pronounced azimuth dependence @xcite for muon incident energies above 1 gev .",
    "we are building a small scintillator detector array nearby willi in order to trigger the muon detection of willi by events of small showers and to determine the average charge ratio within eas @xcite .",
    "the mini - array is formed by 12 detector stations , each being a scintillator plate , 3 cm thickness , divided in 4 parts ( 0.475 x 0.475 m2 - see fig.[willi_eas ] ) .",
    "it is expected that like for the east -west effect of atmospheric muons , the mean charge ratio is affected by the geomagnetic field , especially when - like it is the case with willi - low energy muons are registered .",
    "the simulations of muon charge ratio performed with corsika based on qgsjet model performed for h , see fig.[distance ] , and fe showers with primary energy 10@xmath8 ev , show azimuthal variation , more pronounced with increasing distances of willi detector , from the shower core @xcite .     of the mean muon density distribution of proton - induced eas of inclined showers ( @xmath9 = 45@xmath1 ) incident from the north with the primary energy of 10@xmath8 ev at various distances r from the shower axis , width=188 ]    the simulations studies of the possible configurations of the mini - array have been performed with corsika based on qgsjet model for a mini array with detector stations placed at different distances from willi detector and with different distances between the modules . the quality of the shower core reconstruction was checked for all the cases .",
    "fig.[reconstruction ] shows the reconstructed shower cores for 250 h incident showers placed in one position for 30@xmath1 incident angles ( left ) and the quality of reconstruction for 750 h incident showers uniform distributed on the array s surface for 20 , 30 and 45@xmath1 zenithal incidences ( right ) @xcite .",

    "three different interaction models , qgsjet2 , epos and sybill , have been used .",

    "the simulations of the muon flux for low energy ( @xmath0 1 gev ) , using two interaction models ( dpmjet and qgsjet2 ) have been compared with results of the measurements performed with willi detector , noticing good agreement for both , with very small differences .",

    "the simulations of eas muon charge ratio performed for the real condition of the experiment willi - eas , using two interaction models , dpmjet and qgsjet2 , indicate small differences between them , which become more pronounced for higher inclination of willi .    the present work has been possible due to the support of the romanian authority for scientific research cncsis - uefiscsu 567 by the projects : grant pnii - idei no.461/2009 , code 1442/2008 and pnii - parteneriate 82 - 104/2008 and project pn 09 37 01",
