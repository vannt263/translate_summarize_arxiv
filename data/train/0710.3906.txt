    "most of the stars in our galaxy form in groups or clusters @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to understand the star formation history , the shape of the mass function , and the formation of massive ( m @xmath0 m@xmath1 ) stars in our galaxy , the star formation process must be studied in its most common environment  a cluster .",
    "as stars form from their initial reservoir of gas and dust , they interact with their environment and heat the surrounding material , thus affecting future star formation .",
    "one of the first effects a protostar has on its environment is radiative heating from the accretion luminosity and , subsequently , nuclear fusion .",
    "the radiation efficiently heats the dust , which in turn heats the gas through collisions .",
    "young stars also affect their environment via strong winds and ionization , but this only occurs when they are very massive and have evolved past the very early stages of star formation .",
    "we assume that the massive stars in our sample are very young and are accreting at very high rates ( @xmath2yr ) .",
    "this high accretion rate allows the infalling mass to absorb all of the stellar uv photons @xcite .",
    "many groups use large scale computer simulations to model clustered star formation .",
    "this is a complicated process requiring many assumptions in order to make the problem tractable .",
    "@xcite and martel , evans , & shapiro ( 2006 ) assume that the gas is isothermal . @xcite",
    "go beyond this assumption by using a barotropic equation of state .",
    "however , until recently , no one has included the effect of radiatively heating the dust and gas by the stars formed in the simulation .",
    "@xcite have included an approximate radiative transfer method , which works well in optically thick regions .",
    "their method assumes that the gas temperature is equal to the dust temperature throughout their simulation .",
    "this approximation is only valid at high densities when the dust and gas are collisionally coupled .",
    "here we develop a method that explores the effect of radiative heating and the dust and gas energetics for a range of optical depths and densities .    in our method",
    "we include various heating and cooling processes to calculate the dust and gas temperature .",
    "stars can heat dust grains more effectively than the gas because dust grains have broad - band absorption properties .",
    "although we will not be explicitly modeling the motion or energy density of dust grains , we assume the dust and gas are well - mixed and the dust grains transfer energy to gas particles through collisions using the energy transfer rate discussed in @xcite .",
    "the gas is heated by collisions with hot dust grains and cosmic rays .",
    "it can cool through co and other molecular line emission .    in this paper , we calculate the dust and gas temperature in a field of stars . the dust temperature around a single source",
    "is calculated using a look - up table which we develop here . with this look - up table and an approximation to the flux - temperature conversion",
    ", we calculate the dust temperature in the field .",
    "our look - up table is needed since the calculation of a single dust temperature distribution can take longer than a minute on current desktops and would take a substantial fraction of a large - scale simulation s computations .",
    "therefore we outline our method here which can be used to decrease the time spent on the calculation of the dust temperature in future studies of clustered star formation .    with the calculated value of the dust temperature , we derive the gas temperature field for a distribution of stellar sources , as in a young stellar cluster .",
    "the effect that protostars have on heating their environment using a hydrodynamic and gravity simulation will be addressed in a future paper . in this paper , we first discuss the calculation of the dust temperature for single and multiple sources (  [ sec : analy ] ) , then we describe our gas temperature calculation (  [ sec : gas ] ) , and finally , we show some dust and gas temperature distributions when multiple sources are present (  [ sec : multiple ] ) .",
    "we consider two methods of calculating the dust temperature when there are multiple heating sources .",
    "the first approach assumes radiative equilibrium after summing up the flux of multiple sources heating a dust grain .",
    "this approach makes simplifying assumptions about the dust absorption and emission properties .",
    "the second approach uses the one - dimensional spherical radiative transfer code dusty ( nenkova , ivezi , & elitzur 2000 ) , to add up the energy density contributed by multiple sources ; the dust temperature distribution is calculated separately for each source , then the temperatures are converted to energy densities ( assuming radiative equilibrium ) , which are summed together and then converted back to a temperature .",
    "we first discuss the analytic approach (  [ sec:1 ] ) , then the numerical approach to calculating the dust temperature (  [ sec:2.2 ] ) , and finally we compare and analyze the two approaches (  [ sec : compare ] ) .",
    "the rate of energy absorbed by a dust grain in a field of @xmath3 stars is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the radius of star @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the flux density at the stellar surface of star @xmath6 ( which we assume is a blackbody ) , @xmath8 is the dust grain s absorption efficiency as a function of frequency , @xmath9 is the projected surface area of the grain exposed to the star s light , and the separation between the star @xmath6 and the dust grain is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the location of star @xmath6 and @xmath12 is the position of the dust grain . substituting in the planck function for star @xmath6 at temperature @xmath13 and assuming @xmath14 equation ( [ eq:10 ] ) becomes @xmath15 where @xmath16 and the functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 are defined as the gamma and riemann zeta function .",
    "the same assumptions can be made about the emission of the grain except that the grain emits in all directions ( i.e. @xmath9 becomes @xmath19 ) , the grain is emitting instead of the star ( i.e. @xmath13 becomes @xmath20 ) , and the dust grain s emission efficiency is @xmath21 these assumptions give @xmath22 assuming radiative equilibrium and removing the dependence on stellar radius with @xmath23 , @xmath20 at position @xmath12 is given by @xmath24^{1/(4+\\beta_e)}\\ ] ]    if we assume that grains absorb like graybodies ( @xmath25 ) where stars emit most of their luminosity ( uv ) , then @xmath26 .",

    "using this approximation , we obtain @xmath29^{1/(4+\\beta_e)}\\ ] ] notice that the dependence on stellar temperature disappears in this case .",
    "the value of @xmath30 , where the uv wavelength range is @xmath31 , can be calculated from observations or from a dust grain model .",
    "we compare various values from the literature to the value derived from the dust we use in our models ( see table [ tab : a ] ) .",
    "our dust model is a combination of oh5 dust @xcite and @xcite dust as described in @xcite . for oh5 dust",
    ", we calculate the value of @xmath30 assuming a @xmath32k blackbody .",
    "@xmath33 is the stellar flux weighted average absorption efficiency of the dust and @xmath34 is the absorption cross - section for a dust grain .",
    "therefore , @xmath35    now we consider the various dust models in table [ tab : a ] and fix the value of @xmath36 , the dust grain s emission efficiency exponent . from equation ( [ eq : td ] ) , the form of the dust temperature profile becomes @xmath37^{1 / ( 4+\\beta_{e})},\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is fixed and the values of @xmath39 for each model are given in table [ tab : a ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : sig ] we compare oh5 dust to an analytic approximation ( see equation [ eq : be ] ) normalized at @xmath40 m and vary the value of @xmath36 .",
    "the line with @xmath41 fits well at long wavelengths but not at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the opposite is true for @xmath42 .",
    "since we expect long wavelength emission to dominate these clouds , we adopt an analytic approximation of oh5 dust with @xmath43 as our `` analytic solution '' in the following sections .",
    "another method of calculating the dust temperature around multiple sources uses the code dusty which we have set up with oh5 dust opacities @xcite using the method described in @xcite .",
    "dusty is a one - dimensional spherical radiative transfer code @xcite .",
    "once a dust temperature distribution is derived around a single source , we use it to estimate the dust temperature around multiple sources , using some of the assumptions in the previous method , which we explain in more detail below . using dusty to calculate",
    "the dust temperature around a young star is the most accurate solution ; however , this program can take over 1 minute to run for low optical depths with yet longer run times for larger @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , we calculate the dust temperature profile for various combinations of luminosity , outer radius , and density profile to create a look - up table .",
    "( the parameters we consider are discussed in  [ sec : par ] . )",
    "we then assume that the dust temperature profile around a single source is of the form given in equation ( [ eq : td ] ) , i.e. @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are functions of the density profile and dust properties .",
    "this assumption is valid when the dust is optically thin . although the gas and dust are denser closer to the central source and likely to be optically thick , we are mainly interested in the temperature distribution far from the central source where the physical processes we consider are dominant and the dust and gas are optically thin to the cloud exterior .",
    "for example , close to a forming star [ @xmath48 au @xcite ] there may be a disk , which is not represented by our assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "therefore , it is not useful to model the dust temperature close to the star because it will be affected by the presence of a disk .",
    "for each set of parameters , we run dusty and solve for a value of @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( see  [ sec : par ] ) .",
    "since we are only interested in the dust temperature far from the source , we fit the outer 25% of the dust temperature profile in @xmath49 space using least - squares fitting in order to determine the values of @xmath47 and @xmath46 in equation ( [ eq : a ] ) .",
    "we call these values of @xmath47 and k our `` fit solution '' . in order to calculate the dust temperature of a region heated by more than one protostar , we add up the flux at the region of interest using @xmath50 combining equations ( [ eq : a ] ) and ( [ eq : b ] ) , we derive @xmath51 in general , we assume @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are defined as the flux - weighted averages of the @xmath46 and @xmath47 values that contribute to the flux at point @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath55 and @xmath56 where the sums are from @xmath57 to the total number of stars , @xmath3 .    therefore , equating ( [ eq : q ] ) and ( [ eq : r ] ) and solving for @xmath58 ) gives , @xmath59^{1/ ( 4 + \\bar{\\beta})}.\\ ] ] using equation ( [ eq : a ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath60^{1/ ( 4 + \\bar{\\beta})}\\ ] ] the equation we used to calculate the dust temperature in a field of sources .",
    "we assume the dust and gas are well - mixed and have the same density profile , offset only by the dust to gas mass ratio ( @xmath61 ) described in ",
    "[ sec : gas ] , i.e. @xmath62 we assume @xmath63 , which gives @xmath64 .",
    "the density profile of the gas is parameterized with @xmath65 and @xmath66 using @xmath67    we choose an inner radius of the dust distribution to be fixed at @xmath68au .",
    "this number is smaller than the average sizes of more evolved disks [ i.e. @xcite find disk diameters of 50 - 1000 au for disks in orion ] , which would be considered sub - grid physics in a simulation of clustered star formation with moderate resolution .",
    "however , we find that the choice of the inner radius does not greatly affect the values of @xmath47 and @xmath46 for our models since we are not modeling the increase in temperature where the dust becomes optically thick .",
    "the luminosity required to reach a dust destruction temperature of @xmath69 k at @xmath70 using the analytic solution is @xmath71 .",
    "this is outside our sample range of luminosities ; therefore we can neglect the effects of dust destruction .",
    "we also vary the outer radius , @xmath72 , to obtain a range of values .",
    "we find that our values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 do not strongly depend on @xmath72 .    in all cases ,",
    "the stellar input spectrum is assumed to be a blackbody with temperature @xmath73 .",
    "this value does not strongly influence the output temperature distribution at outer radii since the light is quickly reprocessed by the dust to longer wavelengths .",
    "we model the entire parameter space listed in table [ tab:2par ] with two exceptions .",
    "first , we limit the density at the inner radius to be less than @xmath74@xmath75 , because at higher densities dynamical effects may become important since the free - fall time becomes small as the density increases .",
    "second , we limit the mass of the envelope to be less than @xmath76 @xmath77 since a larger envelope would likely produce a cluster of stars ( assuming a star formation efficiency of 10% and a maximum stellar mass of 100 @xmath77 ) which would break the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "therefore , combinations of large @xmath66 and large @xmath65 may not be represented in our models . based on these restrictions , of the 5049 possible models in our parameter space , we model 3231 or 64% of them . in figure",
    "[ fig : mass ] we show the luminosities and masses modeled in our parameter space .",
    "figure [ fig : alpha ] shows the relationship between the values of @xmath44 , @xmath66 and @xmath65 for the models in our parameter space .",
    "figures [ fig : fidno ] and [ fig : fidl ] compare the two methods of calculating the dust temperature around a single source .",
    "the analytic solution uses oh5 dust parameters with @xmath78 as described in  [ sec:1 ]",
    "which best matches the dust properties used in the dusty solution in figure [ fig : sig ] .",
    "figure [ fig : fidno ] shows that the analytic solution captures the _ shape _ of the dusty temperature profile , but at high @xmath44 it overestimates the _",
    "magnitude_. if we only vary the luminosity ( see figure [ fig : fidl ] ) the offset of the analytic solution to the dusty solution changes , therefore a simple adjustment to the analytic solution based on luminosity would not correct the analytic solution .",
    "the fit solution described in  [ sec:2.2 ] appears to be the best fit , as shown in figures [ fig : fidno ] and [ fig : fidl ] .",
    "figure [ fig : kbeta ] shows histograms of @xmath46 and @xmath47 derived from our fit solution for our parameter space . while most models cluster around the analytic solution , there is a spread that is dependent on some of the input parameters . in figure",
    "[ fig : kbetaalpha ] we show how the values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 depend on the @xmath66 parameter .",
    "models that are far from the analytic solution ( i.e. @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) tend to have small values of @xmath66 .",
    "in figures [ fig : kall ] and [ fig : betaall ] , we show how different parameters determine the values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "figure [ fig : kall ] shows that luminosity and the value of @xmath46 are positively correlated .",
    "although we have explicitly removed the luminosity dependence from equation ( [ eq : a ] ) , there is still some dependence of @xmath46 on luminosity .",
    "this can be understood in terms of radiative trapping",
    ". for high luminosities , more photons at shorter wavelengths exist farther from the star , which increases the size of the region of high optical depth and therefore increases the value of k. also , as @xmath66 increases , @xmath46 decreases .",
    "increasing @xmath66 shrinks the size of the region of high optical depth due to the buildup of material close to the star which absorbs the high energy photons .",
    "figure [ fig : betaall ] shows that as @xmath66 decreases and luminosity increases , @xmath47 moves farther from the analytic solution .",
    "the drastic drop of @xmath47 at high luminosities can be understood by comparing the two models shown in figure [ fig : fidl ] . in the two models , the radius at which the dust temperature turns up ( i.e. , when the material changes from optically thin to optically thick ) moves out in radius as the luminosity increases .",
    "since we model the value of @xmath47 using only the outer 25% of the material , we expect to be considering only the optically thin material . however , as the luminosity increases , the radius at which the transition from optically thick to optically thin material moves outward . therefore , at higher luminosities , our calculation of @xmath47 becomes influenced by the optically thick region .",
    "this is the reason @xmath47 moves away from the optically thin analytic solution as luminosity increases .    in order to calculate values of @xmath47 and @xmath46 not modeled in our parameter space ,",
    "we interpolate between known values in our look - up table .",
    "we use the method for interpolating in two or more dimensions described in chapter 3 of @xcite .",
    "this method involves solving successive one - dimensional interpolations .",
    "we modified the polin2 subroutine to interpolate in 4 dimensions .",
    "the actual method of interpolation that we used was the polynomial interpolation method over 3 known quantities from the subroutine polint in @xcite .",
    "we tested our interpolation method by calculating extra models , not included in our model grid , and comparing the results between the real solution and the interpolated value .",
    "the results are tabulated in table [ tab : interp ] .",
    "we have varied all of the parameters by different amounts and found that the largest percent difference from the model to the interpolated value is @xmath81 .",
    "the largest differences occur at the extremes of the parameter - space at small @xmath66 and large luminosity .",
    "large errors at small values of @xmath66 are likely due to the large scatter of values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 at small @xmath66 ( see figures [ fig : kall ] and [ fig : betaall ] ) .",
    "the large differences at large luminosities are probably due to the rapid change of the value of @xmath47 with luminosity ( see figure [ fig : betaall ] ) .",
    "although @xmath46 does not change as much as @xmath47 , the value of @xmath46 is dependent upon the value of @xmath47 .    based on the previous discussion in this section , we use the numerical dust temperature method described in  [ sec:2.2 ] to calculate the dust temperature in the remainder of the paper . since we are primarily interested in the dust temperature far from the luminosity source , we find that we can model the _ shape _ and _ magnitude _ of the dust temperature distribution most accurately with the numerical dust temperature method",
    ". there might be some error in the calculation of @xmath46 and @xmath47 for models with large luminosities or small @xmath66 s .",
    "however , we do nt expect very small values of @xmath66 to be common @xcite . also",
    ", stars that will eventually have high luminosities are rare and will take awhile to reach this state , therefore we do not expect many stars to have high luminosities during the early stages of star formation which we model .",
    "after the dust temperature as a function of distance from luminosity sources is derived for positions near stars in a cluster using the look - up table , the gas temperature can be calculated assuming gas energetics balance .",
    "we calculate the gas temperature using a gas - dust energetics code which includes energy transfer between gas and dust via collisions , heating by cosmic rays , and molecular cooling ( see @xcite and the appendix in @xcite for a more detailed description ) .",
    "we assume that the dust to gas mass ratio is @xmath82 @xcite and the grain cross - section per baryon is @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the cosmic ray ionization rate is @xmath84 s@xmath85 @xcite and the energy deposited per cosmic ray ionization is @xmath86 ev @xcite in our models .",
    "we take the fractional abundance of co relative to h@xmath87 to be @xmath88 from figure 8a of @xcite .",
    "we assume that the region we are studying is deep within a larger molecular cloud .",
    "therefore , there is no interstellar radiation field impinging on the outer bounds of the cloud and the photoelectric effect on pah s is not present .",
    "the model dependent input parameters are t@xmath89 , local density , column density , and local velocity dispersion ( b ) .",
    "t@xmath89 is calculated with the procedure described in  [ sec:2.2 ] . local density and column density",
    "can be derived from our input density profile .",
    "the column density is calculated radially from the point of interest to the edge of the system .",
    "the edge of the system is defined as either the point at which the density is lowest or some fiducial value ( as discussed later in ",
    "[ sec : multiple ] ) .",
    "the velocity - spread parameter , @xmath90 , is defined for a maxwellian velocity distribution as @xmath91 @xcite and is assumed to be 1 km / s throughout this paper .",
    "figure [ fig : compare ] shows the variation of gas temperature with distance from a stellar heating source for two values of x(co ) .",
    "close to the source , the dust and gas temperature are coupled due to collisional interactions of the dust with the gas .",
    "as the density decreases , collisions between the dust and gas become less frequent and the gas is able to cool via molecular ( mainly co ) rotational transitions .",
    "then as the density continues to drop and there is less co to cool the gas , cosmic ray heating becomes the dominant heating source and the gas temperature increases . for a gas with less co ( x(co)@xmath92 ) ,",
    "the cooling is not as efficient and the temperature is larger . as various other parameters",
    "change in our models , different heating and cooling terms dominate and the minimum and maximum temperatures vary .",
    "we discuss this in more detail in the following section (  [ sec : multiple ] ) .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : compare ] , the gas temperature falls below @xmath93k when gas collisions are the dominant cooling method .",
    "our gas cooling rate calculations are based on the work of @xcite and @xcite which only extend down to 10k because the -co collisional rates were not defined below 10k at the time of their work .",
    "we expect the cooling rate to drop drastically as the temperature approaches zero and we have attempted to adjust our cooling rate calculation to account for this .",
    "our first attempt to calculate the cooling rate ( @xmath94 ) below 10k involved calculating the rate of change of log @xmath94 with log @xmath95 between 20k and 10k ( @xmath96log@xmath94/@xmath96log@xmath95 ) and applying it to temperatures below 10k .",
    "this method has been used in @xcite successfully when dust - gas collisions , rather than -co collisions , are the dominant mode of energy transfer at low temperatures . however , for our models , -co collisions dominate at low temperatures and to take this into account we modify the method of calculating @xmath96log@xmath94/@xmath96log@xmath95 using the large velocity gradient model ( lvg ) . instead of extrapolating the cooling rate to low temperatures",
    ", we extrapolate the co rate coefficients from @xcite from 10k to 5k",
    ". then we calculate @xmath96log@xmath94/@xmath96log@xmath95 between 10k and 5k using the lvg model .",
    "we apply the new values of @xmath96log@xmath94/@xmath96log@xmath95 between 10k and 5k to our gas energetics model . in figure",
    "[ fig : compare ] we compare the temperature derived using the old and new method of calculating the gas temperature .",
    "our change increases the temperature by approximately 1k at the minimum value .",
    "in order to calculate the gas temperature between two sources , we must first calculate the dust temperature .",
    "we do this using the formalism discussed in  [ sec:2.2 ] .",
    "once we have determined the dust temperature , we can use our energetics algorithm to calculate the gas temperature . around each source",
    "we place a density profile . in order for this to be realistic",
    ", we choose a density , @xmath97 at which we have the two density profiles meet .",
    "the value of @xmath97 sets the distance between the sources , i.e. smaller values of @xmath97 place the sources farther apart .",
    "figure [ fig : two ] shows the dust and gas temperature profile for increasing values of @xmath97 , i.e. smaller separations .",
    "an interesting feature of this plot is that if we only look at the region between the two sources , we find a large variation in gas temperature .",
    "this is due to the higher densities sampled as the sources move closer together .",
    "the top panel shows sources that are far apart and we see that the maximum gas temperature between the two sources is @xmath98k and the minimum gas temperature is @xmath99k .",
    "cosmic ray heating , though relatively weak , can warm the material sufficiently far from luminous sources .",
    "as the sources move closer together , cosmic rays become less important until the temperature between the sources ceases to increase , whereas dust heating becomes more important and the gas is not able to cool efficiently and the minimum temperature between the sources rises .      here",
    "we calculate the gas and dust temperature distribution around three sources .",
    "the three sources were placed on three of the corners of a square with sides of length 1000au .",
    "the least luminous source was placed on the corner between the other two sources .",
    "the parameters assumed for each source are given in table [ tab : source ] as well as the position of the sources in a 2000au x 2000au grid .",
    "we calculate the dust temperature using the method described in  [ sec:2.2 ] and show the results in figure [ fig : tdust3 ] .    in order to determine the gas temperature ,",
    "we first calculate the density ( @xmath100 ) and column density ( @xmath101 ) at each point in the grid due to all three sources , individually .",
    "then , at each point we choose the source which gives the highest value of @xmath101 and use that source to calculate @xmath101 , @xmath100 , and the gas temperature .    in order to calculate @xmath101",
    ", we integrate from the point of interest to the `` edge '' in the direction radially away from the source .",
    "we tested two methods of defining the `` edge . ''",
    "our first method , the `` length of square method , '' integrates from the point of interest to 2000au from the source ( figure [ fig : td32000con ] and [ fig : td32000surf ] ) .",
    "the value of 2000 au was chosen to equal the length of the side of the square in which we place our sources .",
    "our second method , the `` edge of square method , '' integrates from the point of interest to the edge of the region studied ( figure [ fig : td3econ ] and [ fig : td3esurf ] ) . using this method , the integration length depends on the direction of integration . in both cases ,",
    "we find that the gas and dust temperature are not equal , unless we are in a region of high density close to a luminosity source as seen in figures [ fig : td32000con ] and [ fig : td3econ ] . in these high density regions , the dust and gas temperature",
    "are coupled through collisions .",
    "as the density decreases , the gas temperature drops rapidly , compared to the dust temperature , due to the ability of the gas to cool through molecular transitions .",
    "another interesting feature of these plots is the detectability of source 1 , the dimmest object in the region , even though it is close to source 2 , the brightest source in the region .",
    "two differences between the two methods of calculating @xmath101 are evident in figures [ fig : tdust3 ] - [ fig : td3econ ] .",
    "the first is the the square shape of the contours near the edges when using the edge of square method in figure [ fig : td3econ ] .",
    "this is an artifact of a square region of interest .",
    "the second difference is the gas temperature near source 1 .",
    "it appears to be shifted in the direction of source 2 for the length of square method ( figure [ fig : td32000con ] ) and is shifted in the opposite direction for the edge of square method ( figure [ fig : td3econ ] ) . for both methods ,",
    "the dust temperature and gas - dust collisional heating is the same in this region .",
    "therefore , the molecular cooling rate and the column density must be different .",
    "for the length of square method the calculation of @xmath101 is dominated by source 2 near source 1 .",
    "this is the reason the gas temperature contour around source 1 is shifted toward source 2 .",
    "the value of @xmath101 drops as we move across source 1 .",
    "this causes a shift in the gas temperature toward source 2 even though the dust temperature on either side of source 1 is symmetric . for the edge of square method , source 1",
    "is able to increase the value of @xmath101 on the side facing away from source 2 over the value calculated from source 2 .",
    "this increase in @xmath101 causes the gas temperature to increase as well .",
    "although neither of these methods is entirely correct , we use the length of square method ( adjusted for the size of the square ) in the following figures due to the square edge effects of the edge of square method .    in figure",
    "[ fig : z31 ] , we compare the gas and dust temperature far from the sources when we replace the three sources with a single source at the location of source 2 .",
    "we use the same parameters as source 2 for our single source , however we have increased its luminosity to 130@xmath102 .",
    "this figure illustrates the difficulty in determining the number of sources responsible for heating the gas and dust and highlights the need for adequate spatial resolution .    in figure",
    "[ fig : zoomout ] , we have zoomed out of the region of interest .",
    "notice that the dust temperature steadily decreases as the distance from the central three sources increases .",
    "yet , the gas temperature slowly begins to rise .",
    "this is due to the decrease of effectiveness of co cooling and the increase in heating by cosmic rays as the density decreases .",
    "we have presented a method for calculating the dust and gas temperature between stellar sources . the analytic method that we investigated for calculating the dust temperature was not accurate enough .",
    "instead , our chosen method of calculating the dust temperature uses a simple radiative transfer code which we use to create a look - up table . once we have derived the dust temperature , we are able to calculate the gas temperature by balancing various energy processes .",
    "we include dust - gas collisional heating , molecular cooling , and cosmic - ray heating .",
    "when we have balanced the energies , we are able to derive the gas temperature .",
    "other methods which set the gas temperature and dust temperature equal assume the gas and dust are opaque everywhere , which is not always true . in figure",
    "[ fig : perdiff ] , we show the percentage difference between the gas and dust temperature , as well as the density , for the distribution of sources discussed in  [ sec : three ] .",
    "these two figures show that the largest percentage difference between the dust and gas temperature occurs where the density is the lowest .",
    "therefore , at low densities ( @xmath103@xmath75 ) , assuming equal dust and gas temperatures is not appropriate .",
    "we plan to use the method discussed in this paper to model a region of clustered star formation with the three - dimensional hydrodynamics code discussed in @xcite .",
    "our method of calculating the gas and dust temperature distribution in a field of young stars will enable us and others to more accurately model clustered star formation observationally and in future simulations .",
