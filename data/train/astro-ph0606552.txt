    "we are entering the era of precision cosmology , with future high precision cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data in the offing .",
    "if the physics governing the evolution of the photon distribution can be modelled reliably , this data offers an almost unique opportunity to measure a large number of cosmological parameters accurately and distinguish models of the early universe .",
    "it is widely recognized that small second ( and higher ) order effects can effect the cmb power spectra at the several - percent level : these include the kinetic and thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effects  @xcite and cmb lensing  @xcite . as well as the cosmological parameters of most interest , there are however also other uncertain parameters governing the background evolution of the universe that can be of comparable importance .",
    "here we focus on the ionization history , parameterized as the ionization fraction as a function of redshift .",
    "the broad details of recombination are well understood  @xcite .",
    "direct recombination to the ground state is ineffective as it releases a high energy photon that immediately ionizes another atom : it can only be important if the photon is sufficiently cosmologically redshifted before encountering another atom .",
    "the dominant mechanism is in fact capture to an excited state followed by a two - photon transition to the ground state .",
    "however there are many excited states in both hydrogen and helium , giving many possible recombination channels .",
    "furthermore level populations may be out of equilibrium , requiring a full multi - level atom evolution to calculate the recombination rate accurately  @xcite .",
    "this can only be done to the extent that the different transition rates are known ( or can be calculated ) , in particular excited state two - photon transition rates are not known very well and are potentially important  @xcite .",
    "the two - photon rates can also differ significantly from their empty - space value due to induced decay by cmb photons  @xcite .",
    "most current cmb power spectrum calculations use the effective model used in the code recfast  @xcite .",
    "however the ionization fraction from this code differs by several percent from a more recent calculation in @xcite that includes additional transitions .",
    "level splitting and other neglected effects can also have percent - level effects on the cmb power spectra  @xcite .",
    "furthermore there is no full calculation with any quantification of the error . when high resolution cmb data are available we will either need to be able to calculate the recombination history sufficiently accurately that errors can be neglected , or we will need to include uncertainties in any analysis . not surprisingly assuming an incorrect history can give biased constraints on the cosmological parameters inferred from cmb data  @xcite .",
    "our aim in this paper is to see whether a crude parameterization of uncertainties in recombination can be used with future data to give reliable parameter constraints when considerable uncertainties remain in the details of recombination .",
    "the detailed task of improving recombination models and parameterizing residual uncertainties is an important challenge for the future .",
    "once recombination has proceeded to reduce the residual ionized density to a low level the details are no longer important for the cmb : the electron density is so low that few cmb photons are scattered .",
    "however at some point first collapsed objects will form , and at some later time high - energy photons emitted by ( for example ) quasars or stars of various populations can cause the universe to reionize @xcite .",
    "current observations of quasar absorption spectra only put a lower bound on reionization redshift , giving evidence for the first neutral hydrogen on our light cone at @xmath0 @xcite . exactly how the ionization fraction evolved between the low level remaining after recombination and @xmath0",
    "is unknown in any detail .",
    "the main cmb constraint on reionization comes from the large scale polarization signal generated by scattering of the cmb quadrupole during reionization .",
    "this gives a characteristic bump in the large scale polarization power spectra on scales larger than the horizon size at reionization , and the exact details of the shape of the bump can in principle be used to constrain the ionization history @xcite .",
    "scales smaller than the horizon size are uniformly damped , leading to a suppression of the acoustic peaks of @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the optical depth to reionization ; the small scales can not therefore be used to constrain the details of the history , only the total optical depth . beyond linear theory",
    "there are also tiny secondary anisotropies on small scales that we do not discuss further here @xcite .",
    "the current constraint on the optical depth from the wmap three - year polarization observations is @xmath3  @xcite , significantly smaller than @xmath4 favoured by the one - year data ( which had unsubtracted foreground contamination ) .",
    "the new value may be more consistent with simple reionization scenarios , though the lower fluctuation amplitude measured by the three - year data makes this interpretation unclear ; for discussion see @xcite .    since there is currently no convincing model of the reionization history we attempt to constrain it in a relatively model independent way .",
    "@xcite suggest a binned fit and performed a principal component analysis with fisher matrix techniques .",
    "they showed that the first two to three eigenmodes should be fairly well constrained with future observations , but other details are effectively unconstrained by the cmb alone . in the second part of this paper we investigate how the reionization history binned in redshift can be constrained with current , perfect , and simulated planck  @xcite data .",
    "the general constraints we obtain are rather weak , however distinct models of reionization can be distinguished . unless there is a convincing physical model for how reionization proceeds , flexible modelling of the reionization history",
    "is required in order not to obtain biased constraints on the optical depth ( and hence the amplitude of primordial fluctuations and @xmath5 inferred from the cmb ) .",
    "since details of reionization are only important on large scales , and details of recombination are only important on small scales , the two effects are virtually independent .",
    "we start by describing our parameter estimation and forecasting methodology , then move on to consider recombination and reionization separately .",
    "we make use of standard markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods to sample from the posterior distribution of the parameters given real or forecast data .",
    "extra parameters governing the ionization history are added to the code camb  @xcite ( based on cmbfast  @xcite ) for computing the cmb anisotropies .",
    "this is then used with a modified version of cosmomc  @xcite to generate samples from the posterior distribution .    for idealized forecasting work",
    "we assume that the temperature @xmath6 and polarization @xmath7 fields ( including noise ) are statistically isotropic and gaussian , and take the @xmath8-polarization signal to be negligible .",
    "we shall assume that foreground sources of polarization can be accurately subtracted using multi - frequency observations .",
    "the covariance over realizations is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an assumed isotropic noise contribution , and we take the noise on @xmath7 and @xmath6 to be uncorrelated .    for a given sky realization one can construct estimators of the @xmath11 given by @xmath12 so that @xmath13 .",
    "the likelihood for the matrix of the estimators @xmath14 given a theoretical matrix @xmath15 , assuming @xmath16 and @xmath17 are gaussian , is then @xmath18 + \\log |{\\bm{c}}_l| \\right\\}.\\ ] ] we calculate the expected log likelihood for each set of parameters @xmath19 .",
    "for some fiducial model with parameters @xmath20 this is given by @xmath21 where the average is over data realizations that could come from the @xmath20 model .",
    "hence the distribution we sample from is the exponential of @xmath22 + \\log    now includes all the different @xmath23 , @xmath24 modes ( we use @xmath25 ) .",
    "the mean log likelihood peaks at the true model @xmath26 , and the shape of the likelihood encapsulates any important degeneracies in the data . to this extent",
    "our method is superior to fisher - based estimates that can be misleading if the posterior is significantly non - gaussian .",
    "posteriors obtained using the mean log likelihood method are approximately the same width as those obtained in most actual realizations of @xmath27 close to the fiducial model .",
    "our method of using mcmc has the benefit of being immediately applicable to real data , allowing us to test much of the parameter estimation pipeline for consistency by forecasting .",
    "note that even though the mean log likelihood peaks at the true model , if the posterior is non - gaussian marginalized constraints on individual parameters need not peak at the true model values .    for our fiducial models we take the best fit six parameter wmap three - year concordance @xmath28cdm model @xcite .",
    "the parameters we vary are the baryon density @xmath29 , dark matter density @xmath30 , approximate ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at last scattering @xmath31 ( from which we derive the hubble parameter @xmath32 ) , constant scalar adiabatic spectral index @xmath33 and scalar adiabatic amplitude @xmath34 at @xmath35 parameterized with a flat prior on @xmath36 .",
    "when considering recombination we assume sharp reionization with optical depth @xmath2 ( fiducial value @xmath37 ) .",
    "we neglect the neutrino masses , and assume negligible tensor and non - adiabatic modes .",
    "fiducial values for other model parameters are @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "we assume a fixed helium fraction of @xmath43 ; marginalizing over uncertainties in this parameter would be trivial , with the effect depending on what ( if any ) external constraint is assumed .    for the planck  satellite",
    "we take a toy model with isotropic noise @xmath44 on large scales , with an effective gaussian beam width of @xmath45 arcminutes @xcite .",
    "since our purpose here is to isolate the effects of reionization we shall not include complicating secondary signals such as sz or cmb lensing , though these must of course be accounted for when analysing real future data .",
    "the lensing effect can be included easily enough and , once included consistently , has little effect on the recovered parameters at planck  sensitivity @xcite .",
    "thermal sz can in principle be removed using the frequency information .",
    "kinetic sz is more difficult to model  @xcite , though expected to be a small signal at @xmath46 ; future work is required to model it sufficiently accurately for reliable parameter estimation . in principle",
    "it might be necessary to model the sz signal as a function of reionization parameters since the kinetic sz signal comes from the inhomogeneous reionization epoch .",
    "indeed ultimately the sz signal may provide a useful constraint on the ionization history , though here we focus on what can be learnt using only the linear polarization signal .",
    "before discussing the effect of uncertainties in the recombination history , we will briefly review the the standard recombination dynamics as implemented in the widely used recfast  code . for full",
    "accuracy one has to do a radiative transfer calculation accounting for many different levels of the hydrogen and helium atoms .",
    "however , for simplicity , we follow the notation of recfast  and describe the recombination process for an _ effective 3-level _ atom , i.e. a two - level atom plus continuum .",
    "detailed balance equations for the proton fraction @xmath47 and singly ionized helium fraction @xmath48 lead to  @xcite : @xmath49 and @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the ionization fraction , @xmath52 is the total density of ionized and neutral hydrogen .",
    "the relation between the recombination coefficients @xmath53 and the photoionization coefficients @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 .",
    "the frequencies @xmath56 are from the characteristic wavelength of the atomic transitions under consideration as indicated by their indices . note that the hydrogen recombination rate @xmath57 in recfast  includes a fudge parameter @xmath58 to effectively describe the multilevel atom .",
    "@xmath59 is the he / h number ratio .",
    "the terms in brackets of expression and are from the detailed balance between recombination and photoionization , while the multiplied terms take into account redshifting of the lyman-@xmath53 photons for the hydrogen atom and for hei the @xmath60 photons via the @xmath61-factors .",
    "further the rates of the two photon decays are given by @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "the recombination and photoionization rates depend on the temperature of the baryons and photons , where the evolution of the baryon temperature @xmath64 is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the radiation temperature , @xmath67 is the radiation constant , and the thomson scattering cross section @xmath68 . for further details and the exact values of the constants",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "we can now discuss two slightly different calculations of the recombination history as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : recomb ] .",
    "one calculation uses recfast , the other is altered at the several - percent level by allowing for additional transitions .",
    "this is achieved using the model of @xcite by modifying the two - photon einstein coefficients @xmath28 to allow transitions from upper levels and making them temperature dependent , i.e. @xmath69 where the sum runs over the upper levels , @xmath56 are the particular transition frequencies and @xmath70 the upper level einstein coefficients with @xmath71 the statistical weights of the states",
    ". the @xmath61 factors also have a less important modification following @xcite .",
    "this particular modification may not be at all accurate , but we can take the difference between these two results to indicate the level of current theoretical uncertainty in the recombination history .",
    "accounting for more transitions generally increases the recombination paths and hence speeds up recombination .",
    "one of the main effects is to slightly shift the redshift of maximum visibility , and hence the angular scale of the cmb acoustic peaks .",
    "however the exact shapes of the cmb power spectra are sensitive to the full shape of the recombination curve : the small scale peak suppression and polarization are quite sensitive to the width of recombination . for percent - level accuracy in the power spectra , the ionization fraction needs to be known to percent - level or better through the peak of the visibility .",
    "helium recombination is more complicated than hydrogen , but also less important : the significant difference between the hei recombination histories only has a percent - level effect on the observed cmb spectrum on small scales due to the slightly modified diffusion damping length .    the dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : recomb_planck ] show the bias on parameter constraints from planck  if an incorrect recombination history is used that differs by as much as the @xcite corrections to recfast .",
    "it should therefore be a matter of some priority to continue the work of  @xcite and @xcite to include all transitions that might be important , and to quantify the importance of poorly known transition rates on the predictions .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the use of a crude ad hoc parameterization that can be used to obtain correct cosmological parameter constraints given the current level of uncertainties .",
    "we regard this as a proof of principle rather than a recommendation for practice .",
    "it may be a useful guide to where most effort needs to be concentrated to obtain more accurate results in future .",
    "we base our calculations on the recfast  code .",
    "we evolve these same equations , with modifications incorporating additional parameters . in recfast",
    "the effect of out of equilibrium distributions lead to a faster rate of hydrogen recombination than in a simple analysis .",
    "this is accounted for by multiplying the recombination coefficient by a ` fudge factor ' f , fixed to 1.14 in recfast  to match their full multi - level atom results .",
    "other authors get slightly different values  @xcite .",
    "we take f to be a free parameter that effectively governs the speed of the end of recombination .    at earlier times recombination",
    "is dominated by the two - photon transitions , accounted for in recfast  only from the lowest excited state .",
    "the calculation of @xcite includes additional transitions from higher states , and there are also corrections from induced decay  @xcite .",
    "we parameterize the uncertainties governing the two - photon transitions by using an effective two - photon rate @xmath62 parameterized by @xmath72.\\ ] ] here @xmath73 is the ( fixed ) empty - space 2s-1s two - photon rate , and the two parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 measure an additional early and late contribution to the two - photon rate from extra transitions and induced decay .",
    "this model is not well motivated physically , but has the benefit of being fairly well constrained from the data .",
    "the exponential form allows it to capture exponential behaviour from boltzmann - factors governing populations of excited states .",
    "since the cmb is only weakly sensitive to the helium recombination , we use the single parameter @xmath76 so that the effective two - photon helium transition rate is given by @xmath77 .",
    "we do not change anything else .",
    "although rather ad hoc , we expect that these parameters should be able to describe most changes to the recombination rate , and have a physical interpretation as measuring an effective rate at four different levels of ionization .",
    "alternative parameterizations are discussed by @xcite .",
    "[ fig : recomb_planck ] shows the parameter constraints from our planck  mean log likelihood forecasting function , using two different fiducial models of recombination .",
    "including marginalization over the four additional recombination parameters allows the cosmological parameters to be extracted correctly in both cases , though with increased error bars .",
    "the posterior of the recombination parameters clearly shows that @xmath74 and @xmath58 can be constrained away from zero , though the other two parameters are poorly constrained . with good polarization data",
    "the parameter @xmath58 is in fact very benign : varying only @xmath58 recovers cosmological parameters with essentially the same error bars as fixing it to 1.14 ( the recfast  value ) .",
    "however varying the rate of the two - photon hydrogen transitions shifts the redshift of maximum visibility , hence the large increase in the posterior range of @xmath78 that governs the positions of the acoustic peaks .",
    "since our parameterization only allows for speeding up of transitions relative to recfast , the posterior distributions are non - gaussian with a tail to larger @xmath78 corresponding to faster recombination , and a one - sided increase to the matter density posterior .",
    "we have only considered basic 6-parameter cosmological models here , and more general models may be more degenerate with the recombination parameters , though a running spectral index can be constrained well even with the extra parameters .",
    "since details of recombination only significantly affect the small scale power spectrum , the impact of standard recombination uncertainties is rather mild when considering only the current wmap three - year data : parameter constraints are affected only by a fraction of the error bar , comparable to the effects of different priors , likelihood modelling approximations , and secondary signals .",
    "for this reason we have not presented constraints on the recombination parameter space for wmap ; recfast  is sufficiently accurate to obtain reliable parameters at the moment .",
    "our ad hoc parameterization may also pick up ( and partly correct for ) many non - standard processes , for example annihilating dark matter could inject energy during and after recombination .",
    "low values for the free fudge parameter @xmath58 would be likely to fit these models better , corresponding to the increased ionization fraction at the end of recombination in these scenarios @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : nonstandard ] shows an ionization history with dark matter annihilation from @xcite , compared to a recfast  history with lower value of the fudge parameter @xmath58 .",
    "the shape at the tail end of recombination is somewhat similar , even though the ( very small ) ionization fraction at late times is significantly different .",
    "the resulting @xmath11 agree to below a percent except for few - percent change to the large - scale polarization signal . as we have seen @xmath58",
    "can be constrained well , largely as a result of planck s good polarization sensitivity , so models with significant annihilation should also be clearly distinguishable . if we treat the annihilation rate as a free parameter , but fix recombination otherwise to recfast , our forecast for planck  suggests homogeneous rates today of @xmath79 per proton will be detectable at @xmath80-confidence , consistent with the forecast of @xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with the constraint on the fudge parameter @xmath58 shown in figure  [ fig : recomb_planck ] when comparing the annihilation history with the similar @xmath81 model shown in figure  [ fig : nonstandard ] .    if the annihilation rate is much higher than that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonstandard ] the fudge parameter @xmath58 will no longer be able to mimic the decay well .",
    "this is because higher annihilation rates give a significant contribution to the optical depth from the lower redshift ionization fraction , and also change the @xmath82 polarization signal more radically .",
    "such large annihilation rates should however be clearly distinguishable using an appropriate model .",
    "physically motivated dark matter candidates are generally expected have a small effect on the cmb power spectra due to decay or annihilation @xcite .",
    "constraints on dark matter annihilation from recent data via the effect on the ionization history are given in @xcite , so we do not consider non - standard models any further here .",
    "ad hoc models for the injection of lyman-@xmath53 photons during recombination could also delay the time of maximum visibility @xcite , so more general parameterizations allowing for slower recombination would be needed to pick up and account for more general models .",
    "models which increase the ionization fraction significantly at quite low redshift can give rise to significant optical depth @xcite .",
    "these models are likely to be ultimately quite well constrained by the large scale polarization signal as part of the recombination component .",
    "an alternative way of modifying the precise details of recombination is to increase the temperature of the matter ( baryons ) , @xmath64 , by the injection of energy , assuming the production of lyman-@xmath53 photons to be inefficient .",
    "such a possibility has been considered previously in @xcite and achieves modifications to the ionization history by shifting the balance between recombination and cooling .",
    "a simple phenomenological model would be to consider the input of energy with a gaussian profile centred around @xmath83 with width @xmath84 .",
    "this can be achieved by inclusion of an extra term in recfast  ( eq .  ) @xmath85\\,,\\ ] ] which , in the absence of any cooling processes and assuming that @xmath86 , would lead to an increase in the matter temperature @xmath87 .",
    "this would require the input of a total energy of @xmath88 per baryon over the period of heating . in any given scenario cooling processes will suppress the effect substantially , but it is still possible to increase the temperature of the igm enough for it to have an observable effect on the cmb anisotropies .",
    "we have investigated the constraint imposed by the current wmap data on @xmath89 as a function of @xmath90 , marginalizing over @xmath91 and the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : heat ] .",
    "we see that for late ( @xmath92 ) and early times ( @xmath93 ) large amounts of energy ( @xmath94 ) can be input without changing the cmb anisotropies ; at low redshift heating effects are swamped by reionization .",
    "large heat inputs may be constrained in other ways , for example , by spectral distortions in the cmb , however any reasonable heat input is not constrained by observational limits on spectral distortions @xcite .",
    "there are tight constraints of @xmath95 for @xmath96 , @xmath97 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 ( all limits are @xmath101 ) .    by considering a fiducial model with @xmath102 , we have also used simulated planck  likelihood functions to show that more stringent constraints will be possible in the near future in the range @xmath103 , as show by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : heat ] .",
    "in order to constrain the reionization history of the universe we bin the ionization fraction in redshift bins with @xmath104 we further introduce a maximum redshift @xmath105 above we follow the standard recombination history without reionization and a minimum redshift @xmath106 below which we assume complete reionization . in practice",
    "we require the ionization history to be smooth , so we join the bins using a @xmath107-function .",
    "we neglect helium reionization at @xmath108 as this only has a very small effect on the cmb . note",
    "that since a constant @xmath109 electron density falls off as @xmath110 in matter domination , the visibility per redshift interval scales like @xmath111 , and hence @xmath109 bins of fixed redshift width contribute somewhat more to the optical depth at higher redshift .",
    "the choice of best bin widths and offset is not obvious without any clear theoretical priors on the expected reionization history .",
    "these could be taken as additional parameters , but for simplicity we fix them here ; we choose the first bin to start at @xmath112 where we think the ionization fraction first was last significantly less than unity .",
    "if the binning is in phase with any features in the ionization history the reconstruction will be much cleaner .",
    "it may therefore be a good idea to use two separate reconstructions offset by half a bin for comparison .",
    "we consider three fiducial reionization histories that all have an optical depth @xmath113 .",
    "the first is a `` standard '' reionization history with sharp complete reionization at a redshift @xmath114 .",
    "the second scenario is a dragged out reionization and the third a double reionization scenario ( for possible physical models and discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "the latter two are modelled using a series of narrow bins in redshift adjusted to give the same total optical depth .",
    "other cosmological parameters are set to the values for the best fit six parameter wmap three - year concordance model @xcite .",
    "figure ( [ fig : fiducialmodels ] ) shows the reionization histories and polarization power spectra for the three fiducial models .",
    "the temperature power spectra are virtually identical , so polarization information is essential .",
    "the accuracy with which the spectra can be measured is limited by cosmic variance on these large scales even if noise and foreground uncertainties were negligible .",
    "this limits the amount of information that can be extracted from the cmb even with perfect data .",
    "the fast and dragged reionization histories give rather similar power spectra , however the double reionization history , which has two distinct peaks in the visibility function , gives a clearly different prediction ( for further discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "if fast reionization is assumed , the inferred optical depth would be incorrect if in reality there is double reionization  @xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig : reion_wrongparams ] .",
    "since the small scale @xmath11 scales with the amplitude as @xmath115 , an incorrect optical depth also means that the cmb constraint on the amplitude ( and hence e.g. @xmath5 ) would also be incorrect . modelling",
    "the reionization history therefore has the joint aims of learning as much as we can about how the universe reionized , at the same time as allowing other cosmological parameters to be constrained reliably .",
    "it is important to be aware of ones priors when using different parameterizations . in particular , when binning some function , introducing many new parameters with flat amplitude priors can correspond to unintended priors on other parameters .",
    "for example , consider the case when we somehow measure only the total optical depth @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath2 is the only parameter we might get @xmath116 , and for simplicity suppose the posterior is gaussian . now say we bin the reionization history in @xmath117 bins that contribute equally to the optical depth so that @xmath118 . then if each bin posterior is uncorrelated and gaussian we have @xmath119 : we have measured each bin to have about the same small contribution to the optical depth without having any relevant data !",
    "this reflects the much larger parameter space volume where all the bins have approximately the same contribution than when most of the contribution is coming from just a few bins .",
    "looking at it the other way , consider @xmath117 bins with total optical depth @xmath118 where @xmath120 , so we treat the contributions to @xmath2 as though independent .",
    "if we have a flat prior on @xmath109 in each bin with @xmath121 , we have a flat prior on the optical depth from each bin of @xmath122 for @xmath123 ( and zero otherwise ) .",
    "the prior on the total @xmath2 is then @xmath124 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{{\\rm{d}}k}{2\\pi } e^{i k \\tau }",
    "\\prod_{n=1}^n \\left [ \\frac{e^{-ik\\tau_n^{(1)}}-1}{-ik\\tau_n^{(1)}}\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & \\sim & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}e^{-(\\tau-\\bar{\\tau})^2/2\\sigma^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the exact integral gives a prior for @xmath2 that is piecewise polynomial , peaking at @xmath125 and with variance @xmath126 .",
    "this approximates a gaussian for large @xmath117 . for bins with equal @xmath127",
    "the exact result is @xmath128 assuming we are in the region where the posterior favours @xmath129 , the binning prior will therefore favour higher values of @xmath2 than using a flat prior on @xmath2 . for",
    "@xmath2 close to zero the prior goes like @xmath130 : you are very unlikely to get all the bins very close to zero .",
    "a good data constraint generally has an exponential likelihood function , so the prior is only logarithmically important compared to the log likelihood , however for large numbers of bins the prior can have a significant effect . in the absence of a strong constraint from the data , assuming a flat prior on a large set of reionization bins",
    "will therefore favour posterior constraints where each bin has a small contribution to the optical depth and the total @xmath2 is higher than you would get from no binning .",
    "it is important to use as much prior information as possible to get relevant results : _ if you use a prior you do nt believe , you should nt in general believe the posterior either_.      figure  [ fig : wmap3 ] shows the constraint from current wmap data @xcite when three and seven reionization bins are used .",
    "the wmap polarization results are noise dominated , so the constraint is very weak .",
    "as shown in the figure , the conclusions one might come to depend on the prior : using more bins indicates that the ionization fraction is constrained to be lower at intermediate redshift than when using only three , if one considers the allowed @xmath131 regions . with only wmap data the result is",
    "largely prior driven .",
    "since most people s prior does not correspond to a random set of amplitudes in seven bins ( e.g. most people probably expect at most one local maximum ) , most people should not believe the result . when better data is used the effect of an unbelievable prior",
    "is much less important , but can still pull results in a direction you do nt really believe .",
    "an alternative parameterization using a bin with a free @xmath132 is described in @xcite , though this is not significantly constrained by the data either ( as expected  @xcite ) .    in order to test",
    "how well cmb observations can constrain reionization in principle we assume that all cosmological parameters , apart from the bins in the ionization fraction , are fixed .",
    "we then use the mean log likelihood from noise - free full - sky data to forecast the reconstruction constraints , using data from @xmath133 where the reionization signal is important .",
    "we use @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 . in the top panel of figure  [ fig : recon ] we show the reconstructed ionization histories for the three fiducial models . from these plots",
    "we see that for perfect data we can distinguish the double reionization scenario from the other two fiducial models at many sigma .",
    "note however that the error bars are correlated , and any detailed hypothesis test should take this into account or work directly from the chains .",
    "models can be distinguished even if they appear consistent in a marginalized error - bar plot : the regions in the full @xmath137-dimensional parameter space may be different even if the projections are the same .",
    "a reionization binning is a nice way to see what sharp redshift information is available , but models that differ by broader features ( for example the sharp and dragged models ) may be better modelled using a more targeted parameterization  for example a couple of parameters governing the slope of @xmath109 as it goes from @xmath138 at @xmath112 to zero at higher redshift .",
    "we next include noise expected from the plancksatellite and allow the other cosmological parameters to vary . the result",
    "is shown in the middle panel of figure [ fig : recon ] .",
    "it is hard to distinguish the three fiducial models at the 2-@xmath139 level by comparing a number of marginalized reionization redshift bin constraints .",
    "this is largely because there is a degeneracy between the bins over the reionization peak : planckcannot resolve the redshift of the start of reionization accurately enough to distinguish high @xmath109 followed by low @xmath109 from the case where two bins contribute more equally .",
    "this is apparent in the ( anti-)correlation of the error bars : when @xmath109 is significant there is a @xmath140 anti - correlation between adjacent points .",
    "if we include a prior that @xmath141 at @xmath142 , the constraint using @xmath143 bins looks much better ( bottom panel of figure [ fig : recon ] ) , though the bins are now fine - tuned to a priori knowledge about the expected form of the history .",
    "bin anti - correlations are still large at @xmath144@xmath145 .",
    "our conclusions are not changed significantly if we instead fix the cosmological parameters : planck  constrain the other parameters well , and on large scales the reconstruction is noise and cosmic variance limited .",
    "the constraint on @xmath2 when seven bins are used is consistent with the fiducial value , whichever ionization history is used : see figure  [ fig : reion_wrongparams ] .",
    "note that our analysis is assuming statistical isotropy ; if the large scale cmb is not isotropic as suggested by numerous analyses of the wmap data , it may be much harder to model or learn anything about the late time ionization history .",
    "alternatively it is possible that the signal from a well understood ionization history could be used to learn more about the structure of the large scale universe .",
    "an alternative to our binned parameterization would be to use a reduced set of well constrained fisher pca components identified by @xcite .",
    "however these have unphysical negative ionization fractions , and the physical interpretation is clearer in easily distinguishable models using our direct redshift binning .",
    "also the pca components depend on the fiducial model ( or an iterative scheme ) , so a one - off binned parameter run is simpler to use in practice .",
    "we have investigated the extraction of pca components from our posterior bin parameter chains , however the results we obtained appear not to be very useful and rather different from the fisher components of @xcite .",
    "this can be partly explained because infinitesimal derivatives about a fiducial model generally give different covariance estimates than samples from posteriors generated using physical priors ( e.g. that @xmath146 ) accounting for the full non - gaussian posterior shape .",
    "modelling the ionization history is crucial to interpret high precision observations of the cmb correctly .",
    "uncertainties in the details of recombination affect the small scale anisotropies , and an incorrect model can lead to strongly biased parameter constraints .",
    "we have made a first step towards modelling recombination uncertainties using an ad hoc parameterization governing the recombination rate at four different ionization fractions .",
    "this was good enough to recover parameter estimates that are consistent , but at the cost of larger error bars .",
    "there is clear motivation for future work to pin down the recombination history in more detail theoretically , with quantification of errors on any poorly measured important parameters . in principle",
    "future work could do a full multi - atom calculation for each cosmological model , including free parameters with error bars for all rates that are not known very accurately . in practice",
    "it is likely to be possible to devise an accurate small set of effective equations that can be evolved quickly , along the lines of the current recfast  code .",
    "using a free parameterization has the advantage of being able to look for any surprises , for example energy injection from annihilating particles , however if the standard model predictions are not well nailed down it may be hard to distinguish subtle unexpected effects from uncertainties in the expected model .",
    "the reionization impacts the large scale cmb polarization anisotropies .",
    "our conclusions effectively agree with previous work , though our direct binning approach is somewhat different .",
    "ideal data can do quite well at distinguishing distinct models , and even planckmay be able to separate the most clear - cut cases .",
    "we concentrate on planck , also there are ground based probes which could provide useful information about reionization .",
    "in particular the background imaging of cosmic extragalactic polarization ( bicep ) has in principle the ability to measure features in the first trough in the e - mode anisotropies , which at least to some degree could constrain the details of the reionization history @xcite .",
    "however the error bars remain quite large even with ideal data , and the cmb is ultimately not going to be the best way to learn about the reionization history observationally : 21 cm emission is likely to be a much better tracer . allowing for different models in a cmb analysis is however crucial to obtain unbiased constraints on the optical depth ( and hence the underlying perturbation variance ) if the optical depth is quite large .",
    "of course if the optical depth is observed to be low , so we know reionization must all have happened around @xmath112 , the modelling for the history becomes less important as there is then little room more complicated reionization scenarios .",
    "alternatively a consensus may arise that the reionization history is expected to be monotonic ( e.g. see @xcite ) , in which case modelling is less important and significantly simpler .",
    "we thank douglas scott , wan yan wong , steven gratton , george efstathiou and anthony challinor for discussion and xuelei chen for his modified version of camb .",
