    "while the theoretical analysis discussed in this talk does involve the observed mass values of the top - quark , @xmath12 boson , and the @xmath13-quark , it is not a matter of any presently available empirical data disagreeing with a standard model ( sm ) prediction .",
    "instead , the interest is because of some theoretical patterns of the helicity amplitudes for @xmath0 decay .",
    "the theoretical patterns involve both the standard model s decay helicity amplitudes , @xmath14 , and the amplitudes @xmath15 in the case of an additional @xmath16 tensorial coupling of relative strength @xmath17 . to focus the discussion , in this talk",
    "the @xmath5 amplitudes are interpreted as corresponding to the observed top - quark decays @xmath0 [ 1 ] .",
    "this identification hypothesis might be excluded by future theoretical analysis and/or empirical data ; in ( i ) , alternatives to this identification were considered [ 2 ] .",
    "experimental tests and measurements in ongoing and forthcoming [ 1,3,4 ] top - quark decay experiments at hadron and @xmath18 colliders should be able to significantly clarify matters .",
    "the explicit expressions for these amplitudes , and other details , are given in ( i ) and in a  hep - ph \" preprint ( ii ) [ 2 ] .",
    "measurement of the sign of the @xmath19 , due to the large interference between the @xmath20 and @xmath21 amplitudes , could exclude such a large chiral weak - transition - moment in @xmath22 decay in favor of the sm prediction . on the other hand , measurement of",
    "the sm predicted fraction of final @xmath20 versus final @xmath21 bosons for this decay mode would not distinguish between the two cases .",
    "the definitive empirical test must establish the sign of @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the relative phase of the two @xmath25 amplitudes , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , c.f .",
    "table 1 below .    in the @xmath28-quark rest frame ,",
    "the matrix element for @xmath29 is @xmath30 where @xmath31 in terms of the @xmath32 and @xmath13-quark helicities . due to rotational invariance",
    ", there are four independent @xmath33 amplitudes for the most general lorentz coupling .",
    "we use the jacob - wick phase - convention for the amplitudes and use the subscript  @xmath34 \" to identify the amplitude s associated coupling ; in this paper @xmath35 sm , @xmath36 for only the additional @xmath37 tensorial coupling , and @xmath38 for @xmath39 when @xmath40 . with respect to the latter case ,",
    "the lorentz coupling involving both the sm s @xmath41 coupling and an additional @xmath3 tensorial coupling of arbitrary relative strength @xmath8 is @xmath42 where @xmath43 , and @xmath44 thus , for @xmath45 in @xmath46 units , which corresponds to the ( + ) amplitudes , the lorentz structure of the effective coupling is very simple @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the w - boson s relativistic four - velocity .",
    "the interest in these particular couplings arose as a by - product of a consideration [ 6 ] of future measurements of competing observables in @xmath50 decay .",
    "in particular , we considered the sm s the @xmath51 coupling values of helicity decay parameters versus those for ",
    "@xmath41 @xmath52 single additional lorentz structures .",
    "\" it was found that versus the sm s dominant l - handed @xmath13-quark amplitudes , there are two  dynamical phase - type ambiguities \" produced respectively by an additional @xmath53 coupling and by an additional @xmath3 tensorial coupling , see the @xmath54 and @xmath55 columns of table 1 .",
    "such a dynamical - ambiguity produced physically by the additional lorentz structure is to be contrasted to the mathematical forcing of a  phase - ambiguity \" by simply changing by - hand the sign of one , or more , of the four helicity amplitudes @xmath56 . by tuning the effective - mass - scale associated with the additional coupling constant ,",
    "the additional @xmath53 coupling , @xmath36 coupling , has respectively changed the sign of the @xmath57 , @xmath58 amplitude . in @xmath59 units ,",
    "the corresponding effective - mass scales are @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "the numerical patterns shown in the table in the case of the additional @xmath62 coupling are not surprising for the @xmath53 coupling because it only contributes to the @xmath20 amplitudes .",
    "however , associated with the additional @xmath3 tensorial coupling , labeled @xmath36 in this table , three interesting numerical puzzles arise at the @xmath63 level in the ( + ) amplitudes versus the sm s pure @xmath41 amplitudes .",
    "the 1st puzzle is that the @xmath64 amplitude has the same value as the @xmath65 amplitude in the sm ; see the corresponding two  220 \" entries in the top of table 1 . from the empirical t - quark and w - boson mass values , the mass ratio @xmath66 .",
    "this can be compared with the puzzle s associated mass relation @xmath67 @xmath68 which follows by setting @xmath69 and then expanding in @xmath70 the @xmath64 amplitude , with @xmath71 $ ] in @xmath72 units . since empirically @xmath73 ,",
    "there is only a 4th significant - figure correction from the finite b - quark mass to the only real - valued solution @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) of this mass relation .",
    "the @xmath63 level of agreement of the two  220 \" entries of table 1 is due to the present central value of @xmath76 , and to the central value and @xmath77 precision of @xmath78 .",
    "the error in the empirical value of the mass ratio @xmath79 is dominated by the current @xmath80 precision of @xmath81 .",
    "the 2nd and 3rd numerical puzzles are the occurrence of the same magnitudes of the two r - handed b - quark amplitudes @xmath82 for the sm and for the additional @xmath37 tensorial coupling .",
    "this is shown in the @xmath83 and @xmath84 columns in the bottom half of table 1 .",
    "as explained below , for @xmath45 the magnitudes of these two r - handed moduli are actually exactly equal and not merely numerically equal to the @xmath85 level .",
    "we will next discuss different types of helicity amplitude relations involving both the standard model s decay helicity amplitudes , @xmath1 , and the amplitudes @xmath86 in the case of an additional @xmath3 tensorial coupling of relative strength @xmath8 .",
    "these relations in some cases  explain \" and in other cases analytically realize as theoretical patterns , these and other numerical puzzles of table 1 .",
    "helicity amplitude relations of types ( i ) and ( ii ) are exact ratio - relations holding for all @xmath87 and @xmath88 values , . by the type ( iii )",
    "ratio - relations holding for all @xmath89 and @xmath90 values , the twb - transformation @xmath91 @xmath92 where @xmath93 @xmath94 characterizes the mass scale @xmath95 .",
    "the parameter @xmath96 is the velocity of the @xmath12-boson in the t - quark rest frame .",
    "somewhat similarly , the amplitude condition ( iv ) , @xmath97 with @xmath98 , and the amplitude condition ( v ) , @xmath99 with @xmath100 , determine respectively the scale of two additional 4x4 twb - transformation matrices @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "thereby , ( iv ) and ( v ) characterize the values of the mass ratios @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath105 denotes small corrections .",
    "it is not understood why the values are simple for the parameters @xmath106 and @xmath13 .",
    "the first type of ratio - relations holds separately for @xmath107 , @xmath38 ; ( i ) : @xmath108    the second type of ratio - relations relates the amplitudes in the two cases ( ii ) : two sign - flip relations , note sign changes of amplitudes in table 1 , @xmath109 @xmath110 and two non - sign - flip relations @xmath111 @xmath112    the third type of ratio - relations , follows by determining the effective mass scale , @xmath8 , so that there is an exact equality for the ratio of left - handed amplitudes ( iii ) : @xmath113 this was the tuning condition used to produce the dynamical phase - ambiguities of table 1 [ 6 ] .",
    "equivalently , @xmath114 follows from each of : @xmath115 @xmath116 @xmath117 alternatively , the value of @xmath8 can be characterized by postulating the existence of a twb - transformation @xmath91 @xmath92 where @xmath93 @xmath94 , with @xmath118 $ ] and analogously for @xmath5 .    assuming ( iii ) , the fourth type of relation is the equality ( iv ) : @xmath119 where @xmath98 .",
    "this is equivalent to the velocity formula @xmath120 for @xmath121 . for @xmath122 , ( iv )",
    "leads to the mass relation discussed above , eq.(5 ) .",

    "but by lorentz invariance @xmath96 must depend on @xmath125 . accepting ( iii ) as exact",
    ", we interpret this to mean that @xmath126 . as shown in ( ii ) , the @xmath127 corrections in @xmath106 , required by lorentz invariance , arise from @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",

    "if one does not distinguish the @xmath38 versus sm indices , respectively of the rows and columns , these three twb - transformation matrices have some simple properties , for details see ( ii ) : the anticommuting 4x4 matrices @xmath141 with @xmath106 arbitrary , and @xmath142 satisfy the closed algebra @xmath143=2\\overline{q},[\\overline{m},\\overline{q } ] = 2\\overline{p},[\\overline{p},\\overline{q}]=2\\overline{m}$ ] .",
    "the bar denotes removal of the overall  @xmath96 \" factor , @xmath144 .",
    "note that @xmath142 is not a twb - transformation ; @xmath142 is obtained from the first listed commutator .    including the b matrix with both @xmath106 and @xmath13 arbitrary , the",

    "this has generated an additional twb transformation @xmath148 ; but @xmath149 and @xmath150 are not twb transformations .",
    "the elements of the three logically - successive twb transformations are constrained by the exact helicity amplitude ratio - relations ( i ) and ( ii ) . thereby , the type ( iii ) ratio - relation fixes @xmath45 and the overall scale of the twb - transformation matrix @xmath151 .",
    "somewhat similarly , the amplitude condition ( iv ) with @xmath98 and the amplitude condition ( v ) with @xmath100 determine respectively the scale of the twb - transformation matrices @xmath101 and @xmath102 and characterize the values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the overall scale can be set here by @xmath76 or @xmath152 .",
    "from the perspective of further  unification \" , @xmath78 is more appropriate since its value is fixed in the sm .",

    "@xmath153 has a distinctively different reality structure , and time - reversal invariance property versus the first class @xmath154 [ 8 ] .    in the present context",
    ", supersymmetry could provide a more general and useful off - shell theoretical framework in which to consider these theoretical patterns of the helicity amplitudes for @xmath155 decay .",
    "form factor effects would naturally occur . in the extant mssm literature ,",
    "see more complete references in ( ii ) , sizable  one - loop - level \" reductions in the @xmath155 partial decay width have been reported : from sm higgs and additional mssm s higg s there is a small @xmath156 correction .",

    "including some two - loop - level corrections and susy qcd corrections in the summary of [ 10 ] a @xmath159 reduction is reported .",
    "it is to be emphasized that , firstly , the ( + ) partial width considered in the present paper constitutes a very large , net @xmath160 reduction versus the born - level sm value and that , secondly , these cited susy calculations have been for the partial width , so other couplings instead of an additional effective @xmath37 tensorial coupling , might be predominantly responsible for these reported reductions .",
    "empirically , important tests of the physical relevance of the theoretical patterns to the observed top - quark decays are : ( a ) measurement of the sign of the @xmath161 helicity parameter via determination of stage - two spin - correlation observables [ 5 ] for the @xmath162 channel . these values for @xmath163",

    "( c ) measurement of the partial width for @xmath171 , e.g. by single top - quark production at a hadron collider [ 11 ] .",
