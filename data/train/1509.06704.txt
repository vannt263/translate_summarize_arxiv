    "statistical systems of many particles have been object of intense analysis for a long time , both from the perspective of physics and mathematics .",
    "the study of a particular type of interacting particle systems , the so - called determinantal point processes ( and their cousins , pfaffian processes ) , has been especially fruitful in the past thirty years .",
    "this success can be explained both by the ubiquitous character and flexibility of these models ( describing the eigenvalues of several random matrix ensembles , non - intersecting diffusion paths , random growth models , random tilings , to mention a few ) and the introduction of new tools , intrinsically related with the analytic theory of orthogonal polynomials and their generalizations .",
    "a common feature of these models is that either the joint probability density , the correlation functions , the normalization constant or the generating function can be expressed as a determinant ( resp .",
    ", a pfaffian ) , and the right selection of the functions appearing in these determinants unveils the integrable structure of the underlying processes .",
    "another unified property of these models is the possibility to put them in the framework of the so - called log gases , where the particles behave as charges on one or two dimensional sets , subject to the logarithmic interaction .",
    "the best known case is the spectrum of some unitary matrix ensembles @xcite , described in terms of classical families of orthogonal polynomials on the real line .",
    "their zeros , all real and simple , satisfy an electrostatic model that goes all the way back to stieltjes @xcite , and solve a minimization problem for the associated ( logarithmic ) energy . in other words , the zeros provide an equilibrium configuration on the conducting real line .",
    "similar situation occurs for some non - intersecting paths models or for the six - vertex model in statistical mechanics @xcite , to mention some more examples .",
    "another classical framework for orthogonal polynomials ( orthogonality on the unit circle ) , developed in the seminal works of szeg @xcite , is connected to the analysis of the ising model @xcite .",
    "further immediate generalizations of the problems above oblige us to leave the real line and extend the notion of orthogonality and the associated log gas models to the complex plane .",
    "the so - called _ non - hermitian orthogonal polynomials _ appear naturally in approximation theory , as denominators of rational ( e.g.  pad ) approximants to analytic functions @xcite , or equivalently , in the study of continued fractions .",
    "electrostatic models on a conducting plane are also associated with the polynomial solutions of certain linear differential equations @xcite .",
    "recently , non - hermitian orthogonality found its way to areas with a much more `` modern '' flavor , playing the crucial role in the description of the rational solutions to painlev equations @xcite , in theoretical physics @xcite and in numerical analysis @xcite .",
    "observe that due to analyticity , there is a certain freedom in the choice of the integration contour for the non - hermitian orthogonal polynomials , which means that the location of their zeros is a priori not clear . as it follows from the fundamental works of nuttall @xcite and stahl @xcite",
    "( see also the survey @xcite ) , the limiting zero counting measure of these polynomials can be characterized in terms of certain max - min problems of the logarithmic potential theory , where the energy is minimized on each compact set , but these minima are maximized over an appropriately chosen class of contours .",
    "these questions ( whose simplest example is the chebotarev s problem @xcite about the selection of sets of minimal logarithmic capacity ) are closely related to the free boundary problems in the theory of partial differential equations .    motivated by his study of convergence of pad approximants to functions with branch points , stahl @xcite not only proved that the zeros of the associated non - hermitian orthogonal polynomials distribute asymptotically as the equilibrium measure on the set of minimal capacity within the appropriate class ( proving in passing their existence ) , but also characterized these sets in terms of a symmetry property , now known as the _ @xmath1-property_.",
    "these ideas were considerably extended by gonchar and rakhmanov @xcite to include the case when the orthogonality weight depends on the degree of the polynomial .",
    "the electrostatic model features now a non - trivial external field ( or background potential ) that persists in the asymptotic regime ; in consequence , the notion of the @xmath1-property had to be extended to deal with this external field .",
    "the resulting gonchar - rakhmanov - stahl ( or grs ) theory allows to formulate conditional theorems of the form : `` _ _ if _ _ there exists a compact set with the @xmath1-property corresponding to the associated electrostatic model , then the weak limit of the zero counting measures of the related non - hermitian orthogonal polynomials is the equilibrium measure of this set '' .",
    "however , the existence of such compact sets is a problem from the geometric function theory , and it usually has to be settled in each concrete situation , basically from scratch .",
    "there are very few genuinely general rigorous results in this sense , for instance the most recent one of kuijlaars and silva @xcite settling down the existence for polynomial external fields on the plane , and also the contribution by kamvissis and rakhmanov @xcite which deals with the green potential instead of the logarithmic potential .",
    "the notion of the @xmath1-property found also a natural interpretation in the light of the deift - zhou s non - linear steepest descent method for the riemann - hilbert problems @xcite .",
    "one of the key steps in the asymptotic analysis is the deformation of the contours , which transforms oscillatory behavior into a non - oscillatory plus exponentially decaying one .",
    "this deformation consists in `` opening of lenses '' along the level sets of certain functions ( known as _",
    "@xmath2-functions _ ) .",
    "it is precisely the @xmath1-property of these sets which guarantees the exponential decay on all non - relevant contours .",
    "the available log gas models on the conducting plane suggest to extend the analysis of the equilibrium distributions ( local energy minima on the prescribed sets ) to the study of saddle points of the logarithmic energy on the plane .",
    "this yields the notion of _ critical measures _",
    ", studied systematically in @xcite , following the original ideas in the unpublished manuscript @xcite .",
    "the advantage of dealing with saddle points of the energy is the possibility to avoid the complications of the free boundaries , as well as to use variational techniques that go back to the work of lwner and schiffer .",
    "one of the main conclusions of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) is the fact that the cauchy transform of any critical measure satisfies ( a.e .  on the plane ) a quadratic equation , known as the _ spectral curve _ in the context of random matrix theory .",
    "an immediate consequence of this fact is that the support of such a measure is a finite union of analytic curves , all of them being trajectories of the same quadratic differential on the plane .",
    "quadratic differentials are known to play an essential role in the study of conformal and quasi - conformal mappings , univalent functions , etcetera .",
    "teichmller @xcite , based on the fundamental work of grtzsch , formulated a principle according to which quadratic differentials and their singularities are associated with the solutions of extremal problems in geometric function theory .",
    "although he did not prove any general result supporting his principle , we should give credit to teichmller for putting spotlight on quadratic differentials .",
    "schiffer @xcite introduced several variational techniques in the geometric function theory , allowing to find differential equations for the boundaries of the extremal domains , which in turn give a more formal connection with quadratic differentials .",
    "see @xcite for further details .    as it was mentioned above",
    ", the riemann - hilbert asymptotic analysis for @xmath3 matrix - valued functions characterizing the non - hermitian orthogonality provides another natural connection with quadratic differentials : the `` right '' level curves for the @xmath2-functions , that usually have a quite complicated structure , are trajectories of a suitable quadratic differential .",
    "thus , the problem of existence of the appropriate curves can be reduced to the question about the global structure of such trajectories .",
    "this is not a simplification ( the description of the global structure can be a formidable task ) , but it opens the gate to other techniques from the geometric function theory .",
    "these ideas have been successfully applied by bertola @xcite , being closely related ( in fact , in some sense equivalent ) to the max - min approach mentioned before , see also @xcite . in the same spirit and in a much more explicit form , quadratic differentials also appeared in similar asymptotic problems in @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that in all these problems , the underlying quadratic differentials are defined on the complex plane .",
    "returning to our motivation rooted in the interacting particle systems , recent works have showed that more general models , such as the hermitian matrix model with an external source @xcite , the two - matrix model @xcite , some classes of non - intersecting paths @xcite or the normal matrix model @xcite require considering log gases with more than one group of charges . in this case , standard orthogonal polynomials are not enough , and we must turn to the so - called _ multiple orthogonal polynomials _ and to the associated vector equilibrium problems @xcite .",
    "the connection of these two notions was put forward first by gonchar and rakhmanov  @xcite , motivated by the analytic theory of hermite  pad approximants .",
    "the reader interested in further details is advised to look into the monograph by nikishin and sorokin  @xcite , which features a nice introduction to vector equilibrium problems from the approximation theory s perspective .",
    "although the analytic theory of multiple orthogonal polynomial is still in its infancy , two somewhat extreme cases are fairly well understood ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the first one , known as the angelesco system , corresponds to orthogonality with respect to measures living on disjoint sets , whose asymptotics is described by a vector equilibrium for repelling systems of charges .",
    "the other one , called the nikishin system , where on the contrary the orthogonality is defined on the same set for all measures , is governed by a system of mutually attracting charges . in both situations the size of the charged ensembles is fixed . from the recent works of aptekarev @xcite and rakhmanov",
    "@xcite it became apparent that the `` intermediate '' cases require more complex log - gases models for their asymptotic descriptions , mixing both attracting and repelling charges , as well as allowing for charges `` flowing '' from one ensemble to another , see sections [ sec : mainresults ] and [ section_general_variational ] below .",
    "in the context of the non - hermitian orthogonality , multiple orthogonal polynomials yield naturally the notion of the _ critical vector - valued measures _ , defined again as saddle points ( and thus , solutions of some variational problems ) for the total logarithmic energy .    in the same vein as the standard non - hermitian orthogonality can be characterized by a @xmath3 matrix valued riemann - hilbert problem @xcite , the multiple orthogonality can be associated with larger ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) matrix valued riemann - hilbert problems @xcite . some heuristics ( that in some situations can be made rigorous using the wkb approximation arguments @xcite ) indicates that the asymptotics of multiple orthogonal polynomials ( and the critical vector - valued measures ) can be described using higher - order algebraic equations .",
    "this is indeed the case , as it follows from some previous works and from the results of this paper .",
    "some instances of the critical vector - valued measures have appeared in literature , basically in the study of the limit zero distribution of some multiple orthogonal polynomials satisfying non - hermitian orthogonality conditions .",
    "the most studied cases are those presenting strong symmetry , so that the support of these measures can be easily derived . other works , such as @xcite ,",
    "consider non - symmetric situations .",
    "their basic approach is to start from a general form expected for a cubic equation that should govern the system , and then make a genus ansatz , hence reducing the free parameters of the equation to a minimum .",
    "although a vector equilibrium is present , due to the explicit form of the deduced algebraic equation its detailed study is not needed and usually bypassed .",
    "moreover , in such situations there is no external field involved , which is indeed a considerable simplification , even in the scalar case .",
    "one of our main motivations is to understand the structure of the critical vector - valued measures with harmonic external fields .",
    "we follow the approach initiated in @xcite , and show that the variational method , applied to critical measures , allows to deduce the corresponding algebraic equation ( spectral curve ) and the associated trajectories of a quadratic differential , now on a compact riemann surface instead of the plane , whose analysis will be the central part of this paper .",
    "assume we are given a vector of three non - negative measures @xmath6 , compactly supported on the plane .",
    "for the interaction matrix @xmath7 and vector of real - valued functions ( `` external fields '' ) @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 are polynomials are rational , we restrict ourselves here to the given matrix @xmath7 and the polynomial external fields ; these choices avoid some technicalities related to cumbersome notation and the order or coincidence of the poles .",
    "] , and denoting by @xmath11 the logarithmic energy of two compactly supported measures @xmath12 and @xmath13 , we consider the total energy functional of the form @xcite @xmath14    matrix @xmath7 is symmetric , singular and positive - semidefinite .",
    "its only non - zero eigenvalue ( of order 2 ) is @xmath15 , and the corresponding eigenspace is given by the vectors @xmath16 ( in what follows , @xmath17 stands for the transpose ) satisfying @xmath18 as it will be seen below , the external fields in must satisfy the compatibility condition of @xmath19 being an eigenvector for the eigenvalue @xmath15 , that is , @xmath20 we complete the description of the electrostatic model by introducing the constraints on vector - valued measures under consideration : given a parameter @xmath21 $ ] , we require that @xmath6 satisfies @xmath22 denotes the total mass ( total variation ) of the measure @xmath12 .",
    "it should be pointed out that a particular case of this model ( with all @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) appears in the work of aptekarev @xcite and rakhmanov @xcite in their study of hermite - pad approximants @xcite .",
    "notice that @xmath7 in contains submatrices that are the interaction matrices both for the angelesco and for the nikishin cases .",
    "let us denote by @xmath25 the plane lebesgue measure on @xmath26 .",
    "we are interested in the existence of critical vector - valued measures within a family @xmath27 of measures @xmath6 satisfying plus the following conditions :    * each @xmath28 , @xmath29 , is a non - negative borel measure , supported on a compact set in @xmath26 of zero plane lebesgue measure , @xmath30 and such that the energy @xmath31 , defined in , is finite . *",

    "<S> saddle points of a vector logarithmic energy with a vector polynomial external field on the plane constitute the _ vector - valued critical measures _ , a notion that finds a natural motivation in several branches of analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we study in depth the case of measures @xmath0 when the mutual interaction comprises both attracting and repelling forces .    for arbitrary vector polynomial external fields we establish general structural results about critical measures , such as their characterization in terms of an algebraic equation solved by an appropriate combination of their cauchy transforms , and the symmetry properties ( or the @xmath1-properties ) exhibited by such measures . in consequence , we conclude that vector - valued critical measures are supported on a finite number of analytic arcs , that are trajectories of a quadratic differential globally defined on a three - sheeted riemann surface . </S>",
    "<S> the complete description of the so - called critical graph for such a differential is the key to the construction of the critical measures .    </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate these connections studying in depth a one - parameter family of critical measures under the action of a cubic external field . </S>",
    "<S> this choice is motivated by the asymptotic analysis of a family of ( non - hermitian ) multiple orthogonal polynomials , that is subject of a forthcoming paper . here </S>",
    "<S> we compute explicitly the riemann surface and the corresponding quadratic differential , and analyze the dynamics of its critical graph as a function of the parameter , giving a detailed description of the occurring phase transitions . when projected back to the complex plane </S>",
    "<S> , this construction gives us the complete family of vector - valued critical measures , that in this context turn out to be vector - valued equilibrium measures . </S>"
