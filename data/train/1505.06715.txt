    "ladder systems have been the focus of much theoretical and experimental work over more than two decades .",
    "one theoretical motivation was to investigate the dimensional crossover between the well - known one - dimensional ( 1d ) physics and the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case , in the search of 2d non - fermi liquid physics .",
    "a second reason stems from experiments and the study of ladder compounds , such as the famous telephone number one sr@xmath1ca@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 which has a superconducting phase at high pression and for a small hole density .",
    "@xcite    the simplest ladder model is that of a two - leg ladder , made of two coupled fermionic chains . in stark contrast to the single chain case , the two - leg ladder system displays a superconducting phase with @xmath5-wave superconductivity for repulsive interactions which stems from the doping of a spin - gapped mott insulating phase at half - filling .",
    "@xcitethis gave the belief that the two - leg ladder problem already contains seeds of the rich physics of the cuprates .",
    "two - leg ladders have thus become over the years a fundamental system for the study of low - dimensional strongly correlated fermions .",
    "various exotic quantum phases have been predicted theoretically depending on the form of the coupling between the two chains and the filling.@xcite experimental realizations of two - leg ladder systems are clearly called for , in particular , to investigate the rich physics of the weak - coupling regime . in this respect ,",
    "ultracold fermionic gases are a promising way to study two - leg ladder problems thanks to the high level of control on interchain hopping and interactions .",
    "@xcite the ladder geometry might be created by considering double - well optical lattices for instance.@xcite    a second possible way is to load a two - component fermi gas in a optical lattice and consider higher - lattice orbitals , typically the @xmath0-band , to simulate a fermionic two - leg ladder system .",
    "more precisely , we consider , in this paper , a two - component fermi gas which is loaded in a 1d optical lattice ( running along the @xmath6-direction ) with moderate strength of ( harmonic ) confining potential @xmath7 in the direction ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) perpendicular to the chain .",
    "@xcite it is assumed that all the @xmath9-level of the oscillator are fully occupied while the @xmath0-level , i.e. , @xmath10 , are partially filled .",
    "the resulting lattice fermionic model has been derived in refs . within the tight - binding approximation and takes the following form : @xmath11 ,     \\label{pbandmodel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the orbital index and @xmath13 is the  spin  index or internal components of the underlying cold atoms . in eq .",

    "model ( [ pbandmodel ] ) can be viewed as a two - chain fermionic system without interchain hopping but with density - density interchain interactions and pair - hopping processes between the two orbitals ( see fig . [",
    "fig : p - band-2leg ] ) .    -band model ( [ pbandmodel ] ) .",
    "the orbital degrees of freedom plays the role of the legs of the ladder . besides the kinetic term with amplitude @xmath18 for each orbital , there are local interactions at each site @xmath15 : density - density intra - orbital ( amplitude @xmath19 , in red ) and inter - orbital ( amplitude @xmath20 , in green ) , orbital exchange ( amplitude @xmath20 , in blue ) and inter - orbital pair - hopping that breaks u(1)@xmath21 generically ( amplitude @xmath20 , in orange ) .",
    "[ fig : p - band-2leg ] ]    the continuous symmetry of model ( [ pbandmodel ] ) for general @xmath22 is : @xmath23 , where u(1)@xmath24 denotes the u(1 ) ( charge ) symmetry related to the conservation of the total number of atoms , while @xmath25 is the internal global su(2 ) ( spin ) symmetry of the two - component fermi gas .",
    "we note that the u(1)@xmath26 continuous symmetry for the orbital degrees of freedom is explicitly broken in eq .",
    "( [ pbandmodel ] ) .",
    "however , the use of harmonic potential in the @xmath8 direction implies a constraint of the two coupling constants @xmath22 and the investigation of model ( [ pbandmodel ] ) along the harmonic line @xmath27 enjoys an u(1)@xmath26 symmetry corresponding to rotation along the @xmath28-axis in the orbital subspace . the u(1)@xmath21 symmetry is trivially realized when @xmath29 where the model reduces to two decoupled su(2 ) hubbard chains .",
    "finally , the @xmath30 case displays also an u(1)@xmath26 symmetry since it is directly related to @xmath29 after a redefinition of the orbital pseudo - spin operator .",
    "we consider , in this paper , the most general case where @xmath22 are not fine - tuned for two main reasons . on the one hand ,",
    "departure from the harmonic line @xmath27 can be investigated by breaking the axial symmetry of the 2d harmonic trap with the introduction of quartic potentials .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the harmonic line has been wrongly identified in refs .   and",
    "we want to make contact with their results obtained when @xmath31 .    at half - filling",
    ", it has been shown that model ( [ pbandmodel ] ) along the harmonic line with repulsive interaction describes a haldane phase @xcite of the spin-1 heisenberg chain .",
    "@xcite the latter is known to be the paradigmatic 1d topological phase protected by symmetry.@xcite for an attractive interaction , a haldane phase for the charge degrees of freedom @xcite has also been predicted in ref .   by means of a strong - coupling approach and density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations .",
    "@xcite in ref .",
    ", it has been shown that there is adiabatic continuity between weak and strong coupling regime and these two haldane phases are related by a spin - charge interchange symmetry .",
    "the half - filled @xmath0-band model ( [ pbandmodel ] ) along the harmonic line thus paves the way to realize experimentally non - trivial haldane phases in the context of cold fermions .    in this paper , by means of a low - energy approach and dmrg calculations , we map out the zero - temperature phase diagram of the @xmath0-band model ( [ pbandmodel ] ) for incommensurate filling and at quarter filling which best avoids three - body looses . in stark contrast to the conclusion of ref .",
    "for attractive interaction , we show that the @xmath0-band model ( [ pbandmodel ] ) away from half - filling does not behave as an attractive 1d hubbard chain with the formation of a 2@xmath32 cdw but instead is a representative of the physics of two - leg fermionic ladders .",
    "in particular , we find that the hallmark of its phase diagram is the emergence of various competing superconducting phases for attractive and repulsive interactions as well as a mott transition with the formation of fully gapped bond - ordering waves ( bow ) .",

    "the charge excitations are described by the bosonic field @xmath47 and its dual field @xmath48 .",
