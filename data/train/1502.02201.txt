    "with the enhancement of the observational instruments , more and more astronomical objects have been discovered continuum radiation from the radio to the x - rays , including active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite , the sun , cool star @xcite and gamma ray burst ( grb ) @xcite , for instance .",
    "recently , the relation between the radio and x - ray emission among different scale objects obtained much attention .",
    "the radio flares and soft x - rays of dwarf m - star uv ceti were observed simultaneously by vla and rosat / hri telescope respectively@xcite . for active cool stars",
    ", @xcite gave a tight correlation between the quiescent radio and x - ray emission , where @xmath5 , known as the g@xmath6del - benz relation . during the rosat all - sky survey accompanied by mostly simultaneous vla observations , @xcite also gave a tight correlation between radio and x - ray luminosities of m dwarfs .",
    "@xcite showed the soft x - ray and radio luminosities of solar flares and the coronae of main - sequence , late - type stars follow the relation , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a coefficient and different types of stars have different values .",
    "@xcite suggested that the heating mechanism of stellar corona is a flare - like process , and in the review , @xcite discussed various aspects of stellar flares . @xcite",
    "discussed a few aspects of radio and x - ray studies of solar - like stars , and gave that nonthermal radio and thermal soft x - ray emissions from solar - like stars provided direct information on particle acceleration and coronae heating in the magnetically confined outer atmospheres .",
    "@xcite found that there is a more tight correlation between the radio and x - ray fluxes of accretion disks in radio - quiet quasars as in coronally active stars , @xmath9 ( with a 1@xmath10 scatter of about a factor of 3 in @xmath0 ) .",
    "they proposed that most of the radio emission might come from coronae , and the coronae are magnetically heated .",
    "@xcite showed that the x - ray and radio emission are coupled in some sources . continued radio and x - ray monitoring of some sources",
    "should reveal the causal relationship between the accretion flow and the powerful jet emission . here",
    "we try to extend the @xmath11 relation to grbs .",
    "grbs are high energy @xmath12-rays lasting from several milliseconds to a few thousand seconds , and they are the most powerful explosions in the universe @xcite .",
    "grbs were discovered in the late 1960s by the military vela satellites @xcite , and caused the great interests of people afterwards .",
    "because the duration of the grb explosion is very short , the precise location can not be determined in the beginning .",
    "also bepposax satellite , launched on 30 april 1996 , confirmed the cosmological distance of grbs in 1997 @xcite . with the launching of space missions ( such as _ swift _ and _ fermi _ ) ,",
    "they have greatly enriched our knowledge of this phenomenon . with the more and more observational data ,",
    "statistical studies have summarized some empirical relationship , such as @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 @xcite and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "a dedicated theoretical study for the @xmath19 relation suggests that it can be a justification of the central engine models of grbs @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite found a uniform correlation between the synchrotron luminosity and doppler factor for both grbs and blazers , which implies that they may share some similar jet physics .",
    "the recent work by @xcite on sw j1644 + 57 ( a tidal disruption event candidate which launches a relativistic jet ) may support this similarity . in their work ,",
    "the radio light curve of sw j1644 + 57 were the successfully interpreted with the afterglow jet model .",
    "the discovery of the long - lived afterglows at x - ray , optical and radio wavelengths advanced the study of large samples of grbs .",
    "@xcite gave a catalog of radio afterglow of grbs over a 14 year period from 1997 to 2011 , and also include the 11hr x - ray observations in it .",
    "these progresses make it possible to extend the @xmath11 relation to grbs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ main ] , we give the samples selection and analysis of solar flares , cool stars , agns and grbs data .",
    "we end with brief conclusion and discussion in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "we investigate the @xmath20 relation of objects in different scales , including stars , agns , and grbs .",
    "the data of the solar flares and cool stars are taken from @xcite , who tabulated the data of @xcite .",
    "solar flare soft x - rays are conventionally measured in a narrow and harder band than the stellar sources , and the data points from the solar flares are for different classes that may deviate from the overall linear relation @xcite .",
    "we take the @xmath0 and @xmath1 of agns from @xcite .",
    "our analysis focus on @xmath0 and @xmath1 for grbs . based on the radio peak flux densities and luminosity distances @xmath21 calculated from the redshift @xmath22 , we can obtain the radio luminosity of grbs afterglow , @xmath23 . for grbs , we chose 47 samples with both radio and x - ray observations .",
    "they are listed in table 1 . before grb 111215a ,",
    "42 grbs are taken from @xcite .",
    "also we can obtain bursts radio frequency and peak flux densities in their table 3 , x - ray flux at 11hr after burst in their table 6 .",
    "for the other five bursts we have used : grb 111215a : @xcite for redshift , @xcite for radio peak flux density , and in it s figure 3 , there are five radio light curves at 5.8 , 8.4 , 19.1 , 24.4 and 93ghz , but from their profiles , the first three may result from the positive and negative shock , and the remaining two may result from external shock , so we chose the peak flux density of 8.4ghz .",
    "grb 120326a : @xcite for redshift , @xcite for radio peak flux density .",
    "grb 130427a : @xcite and @xcite for redshift , @xcite for radio peak flux density .",
    "grb 130603b : @xcite for redshift , @xcite for radio peak flux density .",
    "grb 130907a : @xcite for redshift , @xcite for radio peak flux density .",
    "the x - ray flux at 11hr of these five bursts are taken from swift - xrt products for grbs .    in figure 1 , we give the distribution of the 15 solar flares ( black dot circles ) , 65 cool stars ( blue stars ) , 149 agns ( red triangles ) and 47 grbs ( black solid circles ) objects in the @xmath20 plane . the black solid line in lower panel , @xmath24 is the best fit , and compared to the red dashed line , @xmath25 .",
    "remarkably , all of them appear to follow a similar @xmath20 relation , despite they span @xmath26 orders of magnitude in luminosity between these different types of active objects .",
    "we investigate the @xmath20 relation mentioned by @xcite with our larger samples .",
    "@xcite gave the linear relation @xmath27 for radio quiet quasar ( rqq ) .",
    "in figure 1 , we plot the @xmath0 and @xmath1 on @xmath28 coordinates of our 276 samples , and gets a slightly modified relation @xmath29 with a correlation coefficient @xmath30 . as a comparison",
    ", we have also selected all the 47 grbs , trying to examine the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the best fitting result is @xmath31 with a correlation coefficient @xmath32 .",
    "these correlations can be translated to @xmath33 and @xmath34 the correlation eq.([eq : total ] ) coincide with @xcite , and also can be seen that the @xmath35 correlation discovered by @xcite is confirmed in eq.([eq : grb ] ) with a slightly different slope .",
    "the slope of this correlation becomes flatter when the samples are expanded .    ) .",
    "the lower panel contains 15 solar flares ( black dot circles ) , 65 cool stars ( blue stars ) , 149 agns ( red triangles ) and 47 grbs ( black solid circles ) objects in the @xmath3 plane . the black solid line , @xmath24 is the best fit .",
    "the red dashed line indicates @xmath25.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    [ fig : ge ]",
    "the search of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in grbs was done in this work .",
    "we found the @xmath11 correlation for solar , cool stars and agns can be extended to grbs .",
    "even astrophysical phenomenons are divided into different classes , they still have common features on some properties .",
    "that implies they essentially may have some commonality .",
    "@xcite presented a model of magnetic loop which only have one free parameter , the thermal plasma density , indicating a possible co - spatiality of the two emissions , radio emission and x - ray emission . on the other hand ,",
    "the positive correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is natural .",
    "however , the detailed underlying nature of this relation is still unclear .    not like the other objects , the radio and x - ray data of grbs are not simultaneous .",
    "the radio peak of grb afterglows are generally at several days or even months , while the x - ray data are frozen to be at the 11 hours of the observer s frame .",
    "one reason is that the simultaneous data is very rare .",
    "thanks to the fast corresponding of _ swift _ xrt , the x - ray data can be obtained very quickly .",
    "but it also decays quickly , and fades out in a few days .",
    "there is no fast slewing radio telescope to observe the very early radio emission .",
    "also notice the radio emission is alway optically thick in the early stage , its luminosity is depressed and sensitively related to its size .",
    "therefore , even occasionally the grb location is inside the field of view of a radio telescope , it is very hard to be detected because of the faint luminosity .",
    "later on , with the expansion of the grb ejecta , the radio emission emerges while the x - ray fades away .",
    "that means the simultaneous radio and x - ray luminosities may not obey the proportional relation . from the light curves of grb x - ray afterglows , the x - ray luminosity at 11 hours generally represents a typical x - ray emission .",
    "the correlation of the peak radio luminosity and x - ray luminosity at 11 hours may indicate their energy source origin should be related , rather than microphysical radiation mechanisms .",
    "this extension to the various objects may also indicates the radio and x - ray emission may have the same engine while presenting in two different bands .",
    "the fundamental plane between @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath36 is even tighter in stellar mass and supermassive black holes @xcite . though the grb is believed harboring a stellar mass black hole , the fundamental plane is not extending to grbs .",
