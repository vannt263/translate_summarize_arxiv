    "we are concerned only with the appearance of @xmath454 for @xmath455 , and we have schematically @xmath456 where @xmath457 is an overall bosonic factor and the @xmath458 indicate grassmann variables other than the ones of interest . the overall supercharge delta function has been used to write the latter pair of delta functions so that they each depend on only two of the four grassmann variables of interest .",
    "then the identity is applied to carry out the grassmann integrals , and we find @xmath459 the detailed form of the spinor products @xmath460 , @xmath461 , @xmath430 , and @xmath462 depends on the particular box coefficient under consideration .",
    "we have applied generalized unitarity to calculate the all - multiplicity , nnmhv contributions to one - loop scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric yang - mills and supergravity .",
    "our results for the nnmhv box coefficients in sym are expressed in a manifestly dual superconformal form @xcite , reflecting the proposed duality between dual wilson loops and sym scattering amplitudes at weak coupling .",
    "the interesting effects of collinear and infrared processes on conformal symmetry @xcite requires further study .",
    "does the combination of superconformal and conjectured dual superconformal symmetries @xcite fix the form of scattering amplitudes in @xmath8 yang - mills ?",
    "we also calculated the @xmath3-point mhv and nmhv one - loop amplitudes in sugra .",
    "the requisite tree amplitudes which are sewn together for the coefficients of quadruple cuts were calculated in .",
    "the amplitudes we present are generating functions for the scattering of any of the particles in the supermultiplet appearing as external states .",
    "the use of an on - shell superspace formalism described in ref .",
    "@xcite allows scattering amplitudes with external gluon or graviton states to be easily extracted with grassmann - valued operators .    in this paper",
    "we proved that the ordered gravity subamplitudes introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite may be sewn together to produce ordered box coefficients from which the complete , physical box coefficients are obtained by permuting all the external legs .",
    "the ordered subamplitudes are not physical quantities , but they do yield a more efficient means of calculating sugra amplitudes . instead of permuting over all the legs for each tree amplitude in a quadruple cut , the ordered trees may be sewn directly and then permuted over only the external legs at the end .",
    "this allows the box coefficients to be represented concisely , for arbitrary multiplicity scattering processes .",
    "here we describe the checks we have performed on our results .",
    "the results for sym box coefficients have been numerically checked against the box coefficients for the amplitude @xmath463 presented in ref .",
    "the complex conjugate of this seven - gluon amplitude can be considered a nnmhv amplitude and allows a non - trivial verification of our box coefficients .",
    "we note that the coefficients presented in ref .",
    "@xcite multiply box functions instead of the box integrals alone , where the box functions are scalar box integrals multiplied by the appropriate @xmath221 . thus in comparing our results",
    "we find relations between our coefficients such as @xmath464    for the sugra box coefficients we have numerically verified that the mhv one - loop amplitudes for the scattering of four , five , and six gravitons matches the results in ref .",
    "@xcite up to overall normalization of the amplitudes .",
    "the complex conjugate of the five - point mhv coefficients match our nmhv result , and likewise the six - point mhv amplitude , upon conjugation , agrees with our nnmhv box coefficients .",
    "recall that the ordered box coefficients we calculated yield physical sugra amplitudes by summing over permutations of the external legs . then , after this permutation sum is carried out , the physical amplitudes for the scattering of gravitons can be extracted by grassmann - valued operators .",
    "for instance , we find the relation @xmath465^\\ast      \\textrm{tr}^2[1(2 + 3)4(5 + 6 ) ] \\\\ & \\qquad =      \\int       d^8\\eta_3\\ , d^8\\eta_4\\ , d^8\\eta_5\\ , d^8\\eta_6      \\sum_{\\sigma(23),\\sigma(56 ) } d_{1,2,4,5}^{4m}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the mhv amplitudes we have checked against have few external legs and thus do not require all the box functions which appear in the all - multiplicity nnmhv boxes .",
    "nevertheless , they provide an affirmation of our method for producing physical amplitudes from ordered box coefficients .",
