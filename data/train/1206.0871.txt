    "let @xmath3 be a space endowed with a probability measure @xmath4 , and let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be @xmath7 independent random variables with values in @xmath3 , distributed according to @xmath4 ; from the statistical point of view , @xmath8 is the set of given data .",
    "let @xmath9 be a loss function which associates a real number @xmath10 to any real - valued measurable function @xmath11 defined on @xmath3 and any point @xmath12 .",
    "denote by @xmath13 the loss function @xmath14 associated with @xmath11 and set @xmath15 to be the associated risk .",
    "the risk of any statistic @xmath16 is defined by @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath18 be a class ( usually called the _ model _ ) of real - valued measurable functions defined on @xmath3 .",
    "in learning theory , one wants to assume as little as possible on the class @xmath18 , or on the measure @xmath4 .",
    "the aim is to use the data to construct learning algorithms whose risk is as close as possible to @xmath19 ( and when this infimum is attained by a function @xmath20 in @xmath18 , this element is called an _ oracle _ ) .",
    "hence , one would like to construct procedures  @xmath21 such that , for some @xmath22 , with high probability , @xmath23 the role of the _ residual term _ ( or _ rate _ ) @xmath24 is to capture the `` complexity '' of the problem , and the hope is to make it as small as possible .",
    "when @xmath24 tends to zero as @xmath25 tends to infinity , inequality ( [ eqoracle - inequality ] ) is called an _",
    "oracle inequality_. when @xmath26 , we say that @xmath27 satisfies an _ exact oracle inequality _",
    "( the term _ sharp _ oracle inequality has been also used ) and when @xmath28 it satisfies a _ nonexact oracle inequality_. note that the terminology `` risk bounds '' has been also used for ( [ eqoracle - inequality ] ) in the literature .",
    "a natural algorithm in this setup is the _ empirical risk minimization procedure _ ( erm ) ( terminology due to @xcite ) , in which the _ empirical risk _ functional @xmath29 is minimized and produces @xmath30 .",
    "note that when @xmath31 does not achieve its infimum over @xmath18 or if the minimizer is not unique , we define @xmath32 to be an element in @xmath18 for which @xmath33 .",
    "this algorithm has been extensively studied , and we will compare our first result to the one of .",
    "one motivation in obtaining nonexact oracle inequalities [ equation ( [ eqoracle - inequality ] ) for @xmath34 is the observation that in many situations , one can obtain such an inequality for the erm procedure with a residual term @xmath24 of the order of @xmath1 , while the best residual term achievable by erm in an exact oracle inequality [ equation ( [ eqoracle - inequality ] ) for @xmath35 will only be of the order of @xmath36 for the same problem .",
    "for example , consider the simple case of a finite model @xmath18 of cardinality @xmath37 and the bounded regression model with the quadratic loss function [ i.e. , @xmath38 with @xmath39 for some absolute constant @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "it can be verified that for every @xmath42 , with probability greater than @xmath43 , @xmath32 satisfies a nonexact oracle inequality with a residual term proportional to @xmath44 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is known @xcite that in the same setup , there are finite models for which , with probability greater than a positive constant , @xmath45 can not satisfy an exact oracle inequality with a residual term better than @xmath46 .",
    "thus , it is possible to establish two optimal oracle inequalities [ i.e. , oracle inequalities with a nonimprovable residual term @xmath24 up to some multiplying constant ] for the same procedure with two very different residual terms : one being the square of the other one",
    ". we will see below that the same phenomenon occurs in the classification framework for vc classes .",
    "thus our main goal here is to present a general framework for nonexact oracle inequalities for erm and rerm ( regularized erm ) , and show that they lead to fast rates in cases when the best known exact oracle inequalities have slow rates .",
    "although the improved rates are significant , it is clear that exact inequalities are more `` valuable '' from the statistical point of view .",
    "for example , consider the regression model with the quadratic loss .",
    "it follows from an exact oracle inequality on the prediction risk [ equation ( [ eqoracle - inequality ] ) for @xmath26 ] , another exact oracle inequality , but for the estimation risk @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the regression function of @xmath50 given @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the @xmath53-norm with respect to the marginal distribution of @xmath51 . in other words ,",
    "exact oracle inequalities for the prediction risk @xmath54 provide both prediction and estimation results ( prediction of the output @xmath50 and estimation of the regression function @xmath49 ) whereas nonexact oracle inequalities provide only prediction results .    of course , nonexact inequalities are very useful when it suffices to compare the risk @xmath55 with @xmath56 ; and the aim of this note is to show that the residual term can be dramatically improved in such cases .",
    "the first result of this note is a nonexact oracle inequality for the erm procedure .",
    "to state this result , we need the following notation .",
    "let @xmath57 be a class of real - valued functions defined on  @xmath3 .",
    "an important part of our analysis relies on the behavior of the supremum of the empirical process indexed by @xmath57 @xmath58 where for every @xmath59 , we set @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "recall that for every @xmath62 , the @xmath63 norm of @xmath64 is @xmath65 we will control the supremum ( [ eqsupremum - empirical - process ] ) using the quantities @xmath66 note that for a bounded class @xmath57 , one has @xmath67 and in the sub - exponential case , @xmath68 ( this follows from pisier s inequality ) ; cf .",
    "lemma 2.2.2 in @xcite . throughout this note",
    "we will also use the notation @xmath69 and for any pseudo - norm  @xmath70 on @xmath71 , we will denote by @xmath72 the diameter of  @xmath57 with respect to this norm .    observe that the desired bound depends on the @xmath73 behavior of the _ envelope function _ of the class , @xmath74 .",
    "although this extension seems minor at first , the examples we will present show that the assumption is not very restrictive and allows one to deal with lasso - type situations , in which the indexing class is very small  something which is impossible under the @xmath75 assumption . on the other hand",
    ", it should be emphasized that this is not a step towards an unbounded learning theory . for such results",
    ", the analogous assumption should be that the class has a bounded diameter in @xmath73 , which is , of course , a much weaker assumption than a @xmath73 envelope function and requires different methods ; see , for example , @xcite .    to obtain",
    "the required bound , we will study empirical processes indexed by sets associated with @xmath57 , namely , the star - shaped hull of @xmath57 around zero and the localized subsets for different levels @xmath76 , defined by @xmath77 given a model @xmath18 and a loss function @xmath9 , consider the loss class and the excess loss class @xmath78 and the excess loss class .",
    "we will assume that an oracle @xmath20 exists in @xmath18 , and from here on set @xmath79 .",
    "[ theoa ] there exists an absolute constant @xmath80 for which the following holds .",
    "let @xmath18 be a class of functions and assume that there exists @xmath81 such that for every @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "let @xmath84 , set @xmath85 for which @xmath86 and put @xmath87 an increasing function satisfying that for every @xmath42 , @xmath88 then , for every @xmath42 , with probability greater than @xmath43 , @xmath89    although the formulation of theorem [ theoa ] requires that for every @xmath90 , @xmath91 , we will show that if @xmath9 is nonnegative , this condition is trivially satisfied for @xmath92 .",
    "unfortunately , this type of condition is far from being trivially satisfied for the excess loss class @xmath93 , which is one of the major differences between exact and nonexact oracle inequalities . indeed ,",
    "bernstein condition _",
    ", that for every @xmath94 , @xmath95 ( see @xcite or section [ seccomments ] below ) , used in to obtain exact oracle inequalities with fast rates ( rates of the order of @xmath1 ) , depends on the geometry of the problem @xcite and may not be true in general .",
    "theorem [ theoa ] is similar in nature to corollary  2.9 of @xcite and a detailed comparison between the two results can be found in section [ seccomments ] .",
    "theorem [ theoa ] is similar in nature to theorem 2 in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath96 be a nondecreasing , continuous function , for which @xmath97 and @xmath98 is nonincreasing .",
    "set @xmath18 to be a class of functions where there is some @xmath99 such that @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "if @xmath102 for any @xmath103 satisfying @xmath104 , and @xmath105 is the unique solution of the equation @xmath106 , then for every @xmath107 , with probability greater than @xmath108 , @xmath109    one of the applications of the above theorem in learning theory is for the loss function @xmath110 .",
    "it leads to an exact oracle inequality for the erm procedure , preformed in a class @xmath18 of vc dimension ( see @xcite for more details ) , and with a residual term of the order of @xmath111 .    in comparison , in the same situation , for every @xmath82 , @xmath112",
    "therefore , it follows from theorem [ theoa ] , the argument used to obtain equation ( 29 ) in @xcite ( or example 3 in @xcite ) and the peeling argument which will be presented in ( [ eqpeeling - shahar ] ) below , that for every @xmath107 , with probability greater than @xmath43 , @xmath113    the residual term @xmath114 obtained in @xcite is optimal , but since it heavily depends on the parameter @xmath115 , it ranges between @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( up to a  logarithmic factor ) .",
    "in particular , it can be as bad as the _ square root _ of the residual term of the nonexact oracle inequality ( [ eqmassart - neoi ] ) in the same situation .",
    "the main difference between the two results is that the condition @xmath118 for every @xmath94 is always satisfied whereas the condition that for every @xmath82 @xmath119 depends on the relative position of @xmath50 and @xmath18 , and thus on geometry of the system @xmath120 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the residual term in ( [ eqmassart - neoi ] ) always yields fast rate even for hard classification problem such that @xmath121=1/2 $ ] .",
    "this means that while the prediction problem in classification is completely blind to the geometry of the model , the estimation problem is influenced in a  very strong way by the geometry of @xmath120 .",
    "thus , estimating the regression function ( or the bayes rule ) is in general much harder than predicting the output  @xmath50 .",
    "another related result is the one in @xcite where ( among other results ) an exact oracle inequality is proved for the erm with a residual term  @xmath122 .",
    "the residual term is controlled using the empirical oscillation @xmath123 indexed by @xmath124 , and by the @xmath53 diameter @xmath125 @xmath126 note that all the quantities @xmath127 , @xmath128 from @xcite , @xmath122 from @xcite , @xmath129 from @xcite or theorem [ theoexact - oracle - ineq - erm ] below , define the residual terms of the oracle inequalities as a fixed point of some equation .",
    "those appear naturally either from _ iterative localization _ of the excess risk , converging to @xmath122 @xcite , or from an `` isomorphic '' argument @xcite identifying the `` level '' @xmath130 at which the actual and the empirical structures are equivalent .",
    "we refer the reader to those articles for more details .",
    "results in @xcite were obtained under the boundedness assumption @xmath131 because the necessary tools from empirical processes theory , like contraction inequalities @xcite , only hold under such an assumption . in particular , these results do not apply even to the gaussian regression model .",
    "the approach developed in this work provides a slight improvement , since risk bounds hold if the envelope function @xmath132 is sub - exponential ( which is the case for the gaussian regression model with respect to the square loss ) .",
    "one should also mention the subtle but significant gap between the _ margin assumption _ and the bernstein condition which we use .",
    "both state that for every @xmath94 , @xmath133 for some constant @xmath134 . however , in the margin condition @xmath49 has the minimal risk _ over all measurable functions _",
    "( for instance , @xmath49 is the regression function in the regression model with respect to the quadratic loss ) , while in a bernstein condition @xmath20 is assumed to minimize the risk _ over @xmath18_.    the two conditions are equivalent only when @xmath135 ( and thus @xmath136 ) .",
    "but in general , they are very different . as a simple example , in the bounded regression model [ i.e. , @xmath137 with respect to the quadratic loss , the margin assumption holds with @xmath138 whereas the bernstein condition is not true in general . for more details on the difference between the margin assumption and the bernstein condition",
    "we refer the reader to the discussion in @xcite .",
    "the second type of application we will present deals with nonexact regularized oracle inequalities . usually a model @xmath18 is chosen or constructed according to the belief that an oracle @xmath20 in @xmath18 is close , in some sense , to some minimizer @xmath49 of the risk function in some larger class of functions  @xmath139 [ e.g. , in the regression model ,  @xmath49 can be the regression function and @xmath140 .",
    "hence , by choosing a  particular model @xmath141 , it implicitly means that we believe @xmath49 to be close to  @xmath18 in some sense .",
    "it is not always possible to construct a class @xmath18 that captures properties  @xmath49 is believed to have ( e.g. , a low - dimensional structure or some smoothness properties ) . in such situations , one is not given a single model @xmath18 ( usually the set @xmath139 is too large to be called a model ) , but a functional @xmath142 , called a _",
    "criterion _ , that characterizes each function according to its level of compliance with the desired property  and the smaller the criterion , the `` closer '' one is to the property .",
    "for instance , when @xmath139 is an rkhs , one can take @xmath143 to be the norm in the reproducing kernel hilbert space , or when  @xmath139 is the set of all linear functionals in @xmath144 , one may chose @xmath145 for some @xmath146 $ ] .",
    "the extreme case here is @xmath147 and @xmath148 is the cardinality of the support of @xmath115 ; thus a small criterion means that @xmath115 belongs to a low - dimensional space .    instead of considering the erm over the too large class @xmath139 ,",
    "the goal is to construct a procedure having both good empirical performances and a  small criterion .",
    "one idea , that we will not develop here , is to minimize the empirical risk over the set @xmath149 @xcite , and try to find a  data - dependent way of choosing the radius @xmath150 .",
    "another popular idea is to regularize the empirical risk : consider a nondecreasing function of the criterion called a _ regularizing function _ and denoted by @xmath151 and construct @xmath152 with the obvious extension if the infimum is not attained .",
    "the procedure ( [ eqrerm ] ) is called _ regularized empirical risk minimization procedure _ ( rerm ) .",
    "rerm procedures were introduced to avoid the `` over - fitting '' effect of large models @xcite , and later used to select functions with additional properties , like smoothness ( e.g. , svm estimators in @xcite ) or an underlying low - dimensional structure ( e.g. , the lasso estimator ) .    in this setup , we are interested in constructing estimators @xmath27 realizing the best possible trade - off between the risk and the regularizing function over  @xmath139 : there exists some @xmath22 such that with high probability @xmath153 using the same terminology as in ( [ eqoracle - inequality ] ) , inequality ( [ eqoracle - ineq - penalized ] ) is called a _",
    "regularized oracle inequality_. when @xmath26 , ( [ eqoracle - ineq - penalized ] ) is called an _ exact regularized oracle inequality _ , and when @xmath28 , ( [ eqoracle - ineq - penalized ] ) is called a _",
    "nonexact regularized oracle inequality_.    following our analysis of the erm algorithm , the next result is a regularized oracle inequality for the rerm . but before stating this result , one has to say a word on the way the regularizing function @xmath154 and the criterion @xmath143 are related .",
    "the choice of @xmath154 is driven by the complexity of the sequence @xmath155 of models @xmath156 for any @xmath157 , the complexity of @xmath158 is measured by @xmath159 defined as above for some fixed @xmath84 by @xmath160 hence , @xmath161 is a `` level '' in @xmath162 above which the empirical and the actual structures are equivalent ; namely , with high probability , on the set @xmath163 , @xmath164 thus , the function @xmath165 captures the `` isomorphic profile '' of the collection @xmath166 .",
    "up to minor technical adjustments , the regularizing function , defined formally in ( [ eqpenalty - tilde ] ) , is @xmath167 .",
    "we will study two separate situations , both motivated by the applications we have in mind . in the first ,",
    "@xmath143 will be uniformly bounded and may only grow with the sample size @xmath25that is , there is a constant @xmath168 satisfying that for every , @xmath169 .",
    "the second case we deal with is when the `` isomorphic profile '' @xmath165 tends to infinity with @xmath150 . for technical reasons",
    ", we also introduce an auxiliary function @xmath170 , defined in the following assumption .",
    "[ assthm - b ] assume that for every @xmath171 , @xmath172 a.s . and that there are nondecreasing functions @xmath173 and @xmath174 such that for every @xmath157 and every @xmath175 , @xmath176 let @xmath84 and consider a function @xmath177 nondecreasing in its first argument and such that , for any @xmath157 and @xmath42 , @xmath178    assume that either :    * there exists @xmath179 such that for every @xmath180 and in this case define @xmath181 , for all @xmath84 and @xmath42 , or * the function @xmath165 tends to infinity with @xmath150 and there exists @xmath182 such that @xmath183 , for all @xmath157 and @xmath42 and , in this case , let @xmath184 be any function in @xmath185 and define @xmath170 such that , for every @xmath42 and @xmath84 , @xmath186,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath187 is the generalized inverse function of @xmath127 [ i.e. , @xmath188 , for all @xmath189 and @xmath190 is some absolute constant .",

    "the bernstein - type condition @xmath197 holds when @xmath9 is nonnegative and sub - exponential for @xmath198 .",
    "therefore , and contrary to the situation in exact oracle inequalities , the `` geometry '' of the family of classes @xmath155 does not play a crucial role in the resulting nonexact regularized oracle inequalities .",
    "observe that now the choice of the regularizing function in terms of the criterion is now made explicit : @xmath199      the formulation of theorem [ theob ] seems cumbersome , but it is not very difficult to apply it  and here we will present one application dealing with high - dimensional vectors of short support .",
    "other applications on matrix completion , convex aggregation and model selection can be found in @xcite .",
    "formally , let @xmath200 be @xmath7 i.i.d .",
    "random variables with values in @xmath201 , and denote by @xmath202 the marginal distribution of @xmath51 .",
    "the dimension @xmath203 can be much larger than @xmath25 but we believe that the output @xmath50 can be well predicted by a sparse linear combination of covariables of @xmath51 ; in other words , @xmath50 can be reasonably approximated by @xmath204 for some @xmath205 of short support ( even though we will not require any assumption of this type to obtain our results ) .",
    "these kind of problems are called `` high - dimensional '' because there are more covariables than observations .",
    "nevertheless , one hopes that under the structural assumption that @xmath50 `` depends '' only on a few number of covariables of @xmath51 , it would still be possible to construct efficient statistical procedures to predict @xmath50 .    in this framework , a natural criterion function is the @xmath206 function measuring the size of the support of a vector .",
    "but since this function is far from being convex , using it in practice is hard ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to consider a convex relaxation of the  @xmath206 function as a criterion : the  @xmath0 norm @xcite .    in what follows",
    ", we will apply theorem [ theob ] to establish nonexact regularized oracle inequalities for @xmath0-based rerm procedures , and with fast error rates  a  residual term that tends to @xmath207 like @xmath1 up to logarithmic terms .",
    "the regularizing function resulting from theorem [ theob ] for the @xmath2-loss ( @xmath208 ) will be the @xmath209th power of the @xmath0-norm .",
    "in particular , for the quadratic loss , we regularize by @xmath210 , the _ square of the @xmath0-norm _ , @xmath211 while the standard lasso is regularized by the @xmath0 norm itself .",
    "this choice of the exponent is dictated by the complexity of the underlying models : the sequence of balls @xmath212 trough the isomorphic profile function @xmath165 .",
    "observe that since @xmath213 when @xmath214 , a nonexact oracle inequality for the lasso estimator itself follows from theorem [ theob ] , but with a slow rate of @xmath36 .",
    "using the @xmath209th power of the @xmath0-norm as a penalty function for the @xmath2-risk yields a fast @xmath1 rate ( see theorem [ theoc ] ) .",
    "we will perform this study for the @xmath2-loss function , and in which case , for every @xmath215 , @xmath216 the following result is obtained only under the assumption that @xmath50 and @xmath217 belong to @xmath218 .",
    "since there are no `` statistically reasonable '' @xmath219 variables for , it sounds more `` statistically relevant '' to assume that @xmath220 , @xmath221 are almost surely bounded when one wants results for the @xmath2-risk with @xmath222 , or that the functions are in @xmath223 for @xmath224 ( e.g. , linear models with sub - gaussian noise and a sub - gaussian design satisfy this condition ) .",
    "[ theoc ] let @xmath208 .",
    "there exist constants @xmath191 and @xmath192 that depend only on @xmath209 for which the following holds .",
    "assume that there exists @xmath225 such that @xmath226 , @xmath227 .",
    "for @xmath42 and @xmath228 , let @xmath229 and consider the rerm estimator @xmath230 then , with probability greater than @xmath195 , the @xmath2-risk of @xmath231 satisfies @xmath232 where @xmath233 .",
    "procedures based on the @xmath0-norm as a regularizing or constraint function have been studied extensively in the last few years .",
    "we only mention a small fraction of this very extensive body of work @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is almost impossible to make a proper comparison even with the results mentioned in this partial list .",
    "some of these results are close enough in nature to theorem  [ theoc ] to allow a comparison .",
    "in particular , in @xcite , the authors prove that with high probability , the lasso satisfies an exact oracle inequality with a residual term @xmath234 up to logarithm factors , under tail assumptions on @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in",
    "@xcite , upper bounds on the risks @xmath235 $ ] and @xmath236 were obtained for a weighted lasso @xmath231 when @xmath237 for @xmath238 with short support .",
    "exact oracle inequalities for rerm using an entropy - based criterion or on an @xmath239 criterion ( with @xmath240 close to @xmath241 ) were obtained in @xcite for any convex and regular loss function and with fast rates .",
    "similar bounds were obtained in @xcite for a  rerm using a weighted @xmath0-criterion . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that the lasso and dantzig estimators @xcite satisfy oracle inequalities in the deterministic design setup and under the rec condition .",
    "in fact , in most of these results the authors obtained exact oracle inequalities with an optimal residual term of @xmath242 , which is clearly better than the rate @xmath243 obtained in theorem [ theoc ] for the quadratic loss and in the same context .",
    "however , it is important to note that all these exact oracle inequalities were obtained under an assumption that is similar in nature to the restricted isometry property ( rip ) , whereas in theorem [ theoc ] one does not need that kind of assumption on the design .",
    "although it seems strange that it is possible to obtain fast rates without rip there is nothing magical here .",
    "in fact , the isomorphic argument used to prove theorem [ theob ] ( and thus theorem [ theoc ] ) shows that the random operator @xmath244 satisfies some sort of an rip , which actually coincides with the rip property in the noise - free case @xmath245 for an isotropic design .",
    "this indicates that rip is not the key property in establishing oracle inequalities for the prediction risk , but rather , the `` isomorphic profile '' of the problem at hand , which takes into account the structure of the class of functions .    finally , a word about notation .",
    "throughout , we denote absolute constants or constants that depend on other parameters by @xmath246 , @xmath40 , @xmath192 , @xmath247 , etc .",
    "( and , of course , we will specify when a constant is absolute and when it depends on other parameters ) .",
    "the values of these constants may change from line to line .",
    "the notation @xmath248 ( resp . , @xmath249 ) means that there exist absolute constants @xmath250 such that @xmath251 ( resp . , @xmath252 ) .",
    "if @xmath253 is a  parameter , then @xmath254 means that @xmath255 for some constant @xmath256 depending only on @xmath257 .",
    "we denote by @xmath258 the space @xmath144 endowed with the @xmath239 norm @xmath259 .",
    "the unit ball there is denoted by @xmath260 and the unit euclidean sphere in @xmath144 is @xmath261 .",
    "in this section we obtain a general bound on @xmath262 for the @xmath2-loss when @xmath208 , and show that a bernstein - type condition is satisfied under weak assumption on the loss function .",
    "the _ isomorphic property _ of a functions class measures the `` level '' at which empirical means and actual means are equivalent .",
    "the notion was introduced in this context in  @xcite .",
    "although it is not a necessary feature of this method , if one wishes the isomorphic property to hold with exponential probability , one can use a  high probability deviation bound on the supremum of the localized process . a  standard way",
    "( though not the only way , or even the optimal way ! ) of obtaining such a  result is through of talagrand concentration inequality @xcite applied to localizations of the function class , combined with a good control of the variance in terms of the expectation ( a bernstein - type condition ) . when applied to an excess loss class , this argument leads to exact oracle inequalities ; see , for example , @xcite .",

    "in contrast , because there are functions @xmath516 that can have an arbitrarily small expectation , the complexity of the localized subsets of the star hull of  @xmath503 ( normalized properly , of course ) can even increase as @xmath103 decreases .",
    "this happens in very simple situations ; for example , even in regression relative to  @xmath284 , if @xmath517 , the complexity of the localized sets remains almost stable and starts to decrease only at a very `` low '' level @xmath103 .",
    "this is the reason for the phase transition in the error rate ( @xmath518 ) that one encounters in that problem .",
    "the first term is due to the fact that the complexity of the localized sets does not change as @xmath103 decreases  up to some critical level , while the second captures what happens when the localized sets begin to `` shrink . ''",
    "a concrete example of this phenomenon is treated in the supplementary material @xcite in the convex aggregation context ."
