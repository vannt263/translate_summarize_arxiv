    "it is very easy to derive a cross section or an @xmath0-matrix from a potential ; the reverse is much harder , but can now routinely be achieved for a wide range of cases .",
    "here we introduce the ip ( iterative - perturbative ) inverse scattering method , with the emphasis on its range of applicability , illustrated by a few diverse successful applications .",
    "we hope to inspire applications that we have not thought of .",
    "alternative methods exist for some tasks to which ip inversion can be applied ( e.g.  conventional om searches to obtain potentials from scattering data , and weighted trivially equivalent potentials ( telps ) to derive dpps ) but ip inversion not only has advantages in these cases but also gives reliable results where no other techniques are available .",
    "` inverse scattering ' usually refers to the derivation of the potential corresponding to given @xmath0-matrix elements or phase shifts ; it may be contrasted with the trivial forward case .",
    "this is case 1 of table  [ trad ] .",
    "we shall say little about case 2 of the table , but we will mention case 3 , direct inversion from observables to potential , since the ip method can readily be convoluted with case 2 inversion to yield a very powerful case 3 alternative to conventional optical model searches .",
    ".traditional characterization of forward and inverse scattering cases .",
    "the @xmath7 symbolizes all observables ( analyzing powers , etc ) ; @xmath8 includes @xmath2 etc ; @xmath9 includes spin - orbit and tensor terms . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^ \" , ]     [ phe8 ]      the breakup for this case  @xcite was calculated using the same model for @xmath10he as ref .",
    "@xcite . however the dpp is now very different , having a long range attractive tail generated by the coulomb dipole interaction .",
    "2 shows the short range repulsive / emissive dpp in the surface region .",
    "local regions of emissiveness are a common feature of local potentials representing the highly non - local and @xmath12-dependent dynamical polarization contributions ; unitarity is not broken .",
    "the dpp is not well - defined for @xmath13 fm .",

    "[ pbhe6 - 1 ]    fig .",
    "3 shows the long range attractive and absorptive potentials generated by the dipole coupling ; the real part is appreciable out to 60 fm .",
    "both the real and imaginary dpps strongly influence the elastic scattering differential cross section .",
    "he incident on @xmath11pb , 27 to 66 mev , the dpp outside the nucleus . ]",
    "[ pbhe6 - 2 ]      ` direct data @xmath5 inversion ' is an alternative  @xcite to optical model fitting with parameterized forms for determining potentials from data , especially when there are many data and many parameters .",
    "this is the case for @xmath14-@xmath15he scattering when there is a full set of polarization observables ( including all 3 tensor analyzing powers ) for many angles , all for many energies ranging from 4 to 13 mev",
    "@xcite fitted 1000 data points ( five observables , a wide angular range and many energies ) to produce a multi - component ( wigner and majorana , central , spin - orbit and tensor ) multi - energy potential ( components were functions of energy ) giving a reasonable representation of shape resonances .",
    "this would have been a formidable task for standard optical model codes since they would have had to include the coupled channel calculation for the tensor interaction within the search .",
    "\\1 . systematic crc calculations followed by inversion of the resulting elastic @xmath2",
    "provides a method for establishing shell corrections to the nucleon om potential .",
    "+ 2 . there exists much data for the elastic scattering of neutrons from @xmath16c .",
    "inversion of phase shifts fitted to this data would yield a potential model fitting the non - resonant scattering , allowing an extrapolation to higher neutron energies . comparing the potential derived in this way with theoretical and standard empirical om potentials would support ( or the opposite ) the neutron scattering data as well as the theoretical models .",
    "the ip algorithm appears to be indefinitely generalizable , and has found wider applications than originally envisaged , so are there new applications to nuclear data evaluation ? any suggestions ?",
