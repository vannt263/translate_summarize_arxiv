    "the hot diffuse x - ray emitting gas ( intracluster medium , icm for short ) provides a powerful tool to inspect the internal dynamics of galaxy clusters . for the typical density and temperature of the intracluster gas ,",
    "the main emission mechanism is the bremsstrahlung and , for a large amount of clusters , the radiative cooling time in the central regions is significantly shorter than the hubble time . as a consequence ,",
    "if no additional heating mechanism is present , the gas cools and is expected to flow inwards , forming a _ cooling flow_. the standard model of cooling flows ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) predicted the gas to be a multiphase medium in which there is a broad range of temperatures and densities present at all radii .",
    "mass deposition rates were estimated to be as large as hundreds of solar masses per year @xcite .",
    "this model was strengthened by the general thought that in presence of magnetic fields the thermal conduction must be highly suppressed @xcite , which is a necessary condition for the multiphase cooling to operate .",
    "in fact , no heating exchange between the different phases must occur in order that they may coexist .",
    "there is some observational evidence that modest magnetic fields are present throughout the intracluster medium .",
    "the current measurements of intracluster magnetic fields are based on faraday rotation measure ( rm ) in radio sources seen through clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; direct evidence also comes from measurements of extended regions of radio synchrotron emission in clusters ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "both the excess rm values and the radio halo data suggest modest magnetic fields , at a few microgauss levels , throughout the cluster .",
    "recent and _ chandra _ observations have shown that in the central regions , the temperature drops to about one third of its overall mean value and there is no evidence of temperatures smaller than @xmath2 kev @xcite , suggesting that the gas does not cool below these cutoff temperatures . moreover , the new estimated mass deposition rates are significantly smaller than those evaluated by using previous x - ray satellites data @xcite .",
    "lastly , the new data show that clusters spectra are better represented by a single ( or double ) temperature model rather than the standard multiphase ( multi - temperature ) cooling flow model @xcite .",
    "these new results clearly show that the standard cooling flow model is not a satisfying description of the internal dynamics of the icm .",
    "some source of heat which stops the cooling flow and balances radiative losses must be sought .",
    "the nature of this source and the origin of the heat mechanism is still unclear .",
    "one possible candidate is thermal conduction .",
    "recent works by @xcite and @xcite show that in the presence of turbulent magnetic fields , the conductivity can be as large as a fraction of the spitzer value and thus can play a significant role in balancing cooling flows . as a consequence",
    ", thermal conduction has been recently re - introduced as a possible heat source to balance the energy losses ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , as we will discuss more in detail in  [ sub : cond ] , thermal conduction fails in supplying the needed heat in the central regions ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "heating from a central active galactic nucleus is another possibility .",
    "the idea is supported by the fact that most of `` cooling clusters '' host a central active galactic nucleus with strong radio activity @xcite .",
    "several models in the literature explore agn heating processes to assess if they can balance the radiative losses .",
    "one of the most appealing mechanisms involves buoyant gas bubbles , inflated by the agn , that subsequently rise through the cluster icm heating it up @xcite .    however , all the models predicting that radiative cooling is balanced only by energy input from the central agn fail @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite analyzed several heating mechanisms induced by the central agn and concluded that no simple mechanism is able to quench the cooling flow .",
    "moreover , the required mechanism needs a finely tuned heating source .",
    "indeed , the heat source must provide sufficient energy to stop the cooling flow , but not enough to trigger strong convection or the metallicity gradients observed in all cooling flow clusters @xcite would be destroyed . as a consequence",
    ", an agn can be an efficient mechanism in the very center of the cluster but it is unlikely to be strong enough to provide energy to the outer parts of the `` cooling region '' .",
    "so , it may be viewed as complementary to thermal conduction which fails in quenching the cooling flow in the innermost regions .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite concluded that both thermal conduction and heating from a central agn can play an important role in balancing the cooling .",
    "in particular , @xcite ( rb02 hereafter ) developed a model where both thermal conduction and heating from a central agn co - operate in balancing the radiative losses .",
    "one of the main advantages of this model is that it reaches a stable final equilibrium state and it is able to reproduce the main observed quantities , such as the temperature profile ( with a minimum temperature @xmath3 kev ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use m87/virgo observations of three satellites ( namely , _",
    "chandra _ and _ beppo - sax _ ) to test various heating models on this cluster . to this end",
    ", we apply to the m87 data the deprojection technique to recover some physical quantities of the icm such as the gravitational mass , the entropy and the heating required to balance the cooling flow .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : sp2d ] we report details about the analysis of the three ( _ chandra _ , and _ beppo - sax _ ) m87 datasets ; in  [ sec : depro ] , we revise briefly the spectral deprojection technique that we adopt for our analysis ; in  [ sec : m87 ] , we deproject the m87 data , we test that the spherical symmetry hypothesis holds and we derive the gravitational mass for m87 ; in  [ sec : heat ] , we determine the amount of extra - heating needed to balance the cooling flow when thermal conductivity is assumed to operate at a fraction of the spitzer value .",
    "lastly , in  [ sec : concl ] we summarize our results .",
    "thanks to its proximity , the virgo cluster and its giant elliptical central galaxy m87 , represent an incomparable target to inspect the internal properties of the icm . aiming to a precise characterization of the icm , we use observations of the three satellites _",
    "chandra _ , and _ beppo - sax_. these satellites views are complementary : the sharp psf ( @xmath4 ) of _ chandra _ can provide a precise analysis of the innermost ( say @xmath5 kpc ) regions of m87 ; the large collecting area and its wide field of view allow a good inspection of the intermediate regions ( up to @xmath6 kpc ) ; in the outermost regions of the cluster , where the angular resolution is less critical and data are highly contaminated by the background , _ beppo - sax _ is a better choice and data can be collected out to a radius of @xmath7 kpc .",

    "the regions are the same as those presented in m02 , apart from the annuli in the @xmath8 arcmin range which have been taken 0.5 arcmin wide instead of 1 arcmin wide . unlike @xcite , we decided to use annuli at least @xmath9 wide in order to avoid possible psf contaminations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "for a detailed description of the mos psf see @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to m02 for all the details of the spectral analysis procedure and remind the reader that the accumulated spectra in all the regions are fitted with two different models : ( i ) a single temperature ( 1 t ) model ( _ vmekal _ in ) and ( ii ) a two temperature ( 2 t ) model ( _ vmekal _ + _ vmekal _ in ) .",

    "note that , as we will discuss in the next paragraph , for _ beppo - sax _ data , only the 1 t model has been used to fit the accumulated spectra",
    ".      for each region observed with or _",
    "chandra _ , an f - test is used to establish whether the 2 t model provides a better description of the data with respect to the 1 t model .",
    "we used two different criteria for and _ chandra _ data to select the regions represented by a 2 t model . as far as data are concerned , for those regions",
    "whose f - test provides a probability @xmath40 , the 2 t description is retained , whereas for those regions whose f - test provides a probability @xmath41 , the 1 t description is adopted .",
    "the regions having an f - test probability within the [ 0.90 - 0.95 ] range have been rejected and excluded from the analysis .",
    "a somewhat more stringent criterion has been adopted for the _ chandra _ data , regions with f - test probability within the [ 0.75 - 0.98 ] range have been rejected , because of the lower statistical quality of the latter dataset .",
    "it is worth noting that m02 shows ( using data ) that the regions which are better represented by a 2 t model match the radio `` arms '' which are visible in the m87 map at 90 cm @xcite . at large radii , where we have no evidence of a second temperature component from the data , we will use the results of 1 t fits to the _ beppo - sax _ data , which , because of its limited spectral coverage , is insensitive to the cooler component .    while the cool component is related to the radio `` arms '' , the hot component in the regions described by the 2 t model , is very similar to the 1 t gas of the other regions which do not feature strong radio emission and are located at similar radial distances from the cluster core . in fig .",

    "[ fig : cfrt_s ] shows that for those annuli where we have 1 t and 2 t regions , the temperature of the hot component of the 2 t regions is not separate from the temperature of the single phase gas of the 1 t regions .",
    "so , the hot component and the single phase gas are distributed in a regular and symmetric fashion . as far as only the hot component",
    "is considered for the 2 t regions , the cluster appears to be approximatively spherically symmetric , which is an important condition for the application of the deprojection technique .",
    "as already outlined , for each region we consider the emission integral @xmath42 and the emission - weighted temperature @xmath10 .",
    "for those regions fitted by the 2 t model , we retain the @xmath42 and @xmath10 related to the hot component .",

    "the @xmath42 is the sum of the @xmath42 of the regions along the ring .",
    "some attention must be paid in this averaging ( or summation for @xmath42 ) procedure as some portions of the observed regions can be masked .",
    "in fact , there are some pixels of the field of view of the different instruments which must be rejected for different reasons : ( i ) they are ccd hot or dead pixels ; ( ii ) they correspond to the gaps between nearby ccds ; ( iii ) they correspond to regions which are never observed by the instruments ( for mecs ) or which are partially outside the field of view ; ( iv ) they correspond to some point source contaminating the x - ray cluster emission ; ( v ) they correspond to the excluded agn rectangular regions ( _ chandra _ ) . as a consequence , even if the geometrical area ( or equivalently the emitting volume ) of the regions belonging to the same ring is the same , the effective emitting area ( or volume ) is a fraction of the geometrical area depending on the number of rejected pixels .",
    "the measured @xmath42 in each region accounts for photons coming from the effective emitting area ( or volume ) ; hence , each @xmath42 must be renormalized .",
    "the factor of normalization is given by the ratio @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the geometric area of the region and @xmath45 is the total area of the rejected pixels in the region .",

    "the main advantage in using this technique is that deriving the electron density @xmath12 from @xmath42 is straightforward without any assumption on its functional shape .",

    "it is worth noting that eq .",
    "( [ eq : depro ] ) is derived using the onion  peeling procedure where the contribution to the emission in each shell is obtained from the projected quantity by subtracting off the emission contribution of the outer shells starting from the edge of the cluster and moving inwards .",

    "for the temperature profile , we find the following best - fit values : @xmath86 kev , @xmath87 kev , @xmath88 . for what concerns the electron density , we find @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 @xmath50 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xmath50 .",
    "the inferred best fit values have large statistical errors .",
    "this is due to the large number of free parameters adopted .",

    "for the radius @xmath98 we decided to use the value of the @xmath99 inferred from the best fit of the temperature profile , which defines the scale radius for the rise of the temperature . having fixed the values of @xmath98 and @xmath95 , we find : @xmath100 , @xmath101 @xmath50 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 @xmath50 .",

    "however , we should like to verify if any correlation of the hot component with the radio emission exists , invalidating our assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "to this aim , we divided the cluster in sectors and deprojected separately each sector .",
    "again we consider only the hot component for the 2 t regions .",
    "the sectors have been chosen according to the radio emission regions : the @xmath106 $ ] , @xmath107 $ ] and @xmath108 $ ] sectors have been cumulated together to form the non - radio sector .",
    "furthermore , we analyzed separately each of the following sectors : @xmath109 $ ] , @xmath110 $ ] , @xmath111 $ ] , @xmath112 $ ] which correspond or are close to the radio emission arms .",
    "the _ chandra _ data are not suitable to perform such a study , because the statistics is not very high . in this case",
    ", possible azimuthal variations can be hidden by errors .",
    "therefore , in order to verify the assumption of spherical symmetry , we consider only the data ( circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : t2d - ei ] ) . nevertheless , also with data , it is quite difficult to use small sectors to perform sector - by - sector comparisons since their statistics is not very high .",
    "a significant comparison can be made between the whole cluster and the non - radio selected sector . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ne_tslice ] ( in panel ( a ) and ( b ) respectively ) we compare the @xmath12 and @xmath10 profiles for the whole cluster ( filled dots ) with the non - radio sector ( open diamonds ) . in general , no significant differences are evident .",
    "the profiles of the electron density are almost identical whereas there is a slight tendency of the temperature calculated on the whole cluster to be smaller than the temperature of the non - radio sector .",
    "the difference is due to the fact that in the non - radio sector only 1 t regions contribute , while in the whole cluster profile also the contribution of the hot component temperature of the regions described by a 2 t model is accounted .",
    "this temperature is slightly smaller than the overall temperature and produces a mild decrease of the whole cluster temperature profile with respect to the non - radio sector temperature profiles .",
    "however , differences are well within 1@xmath113 ; thus , excluding the radio emission sectors ( or the regions described by the 2 t model ) does not affect significantly the results and no evident azimuthal asymmetry can be highlighted .",
    "we can conclude that the spherical symmetry assumption , which is an important condition for our analysis , is tenable .",
    "it is also worth noting that , in order to derive most of the other physical quantities ( mass , conduction , entropy , etc . )",
    "a smoothing operation on @xmath10 and @xmath12 is necessary , so that the small differences reported above would not anyhow affect our results .",

    "thus , assuming that the blobs are tied to the bubbles and that they occupy similar volumes , their density contrast with the surrounding icm will be small . in fig .",
    "[ fig : velb ] the dotted line plots the bubble rise velocity @xmath211 for a @xmath243 . starting from the rise velocity , it is straightforward to derive the rise timescale of the bubbles . for a density @xmath220 and a bubble radius of @xmath53 pc ,",
    "the risetime is @xmath181 yr at @xmath244 kpc and it becomes even larger for smaller bubbles and smaller density contrasts , holding @xmath245 . as outlined previously , this value is significantly larger than the duty cycle timescale @xmath179 of intermittency of the agn , so that the ratio @xmath246 and the mechanism approaches the steady state .",
    "it is worth noting that the above picture refers to radio bubbles and cool x - ray blobs located in the lobes .",
    "however , the heating process related to the rise of the bubbles must be isotropic throughout the cluster in order to balance the cooling flow . under the assumption that the radio galaxy is intermittent on a short timescale",
    ", the mechanism is expected to heat isotropically the icm since it is likely that no direction is preferred for the agn ejection ; we also recall that when the agn is turned off the bubbles continue their rise within the icm heating it up ; within this picture , by averaging on a cooling time , the radio bubble populations are likely to be isotropically distributed in the cluster .    nevertheless , the cool x ",
    "ray blobs are detected only in the lobes regions .",
    "so the picture emerging here is that of an agn which injects radio bubbles , in all the directions , through a succession of outbursts . in the lobes ,",
    "the outburst is occurring at the present time and , here , also the cool x - ray blobs are present .",
    "they are tied to the radio bubbles and the magnetic fields shield them from collisions with icm particles .",
    "the thermal conduction is inhibited allowing the cool blobs to survive in a hotter ambient medium . in the halo , where the radio bubbles have been injected during a past activity of the agn",
    ", only `` old '' populations of bubbles which are buoyantly rising are present .",
    "it is likely that the cool blobs which were tied to the radio bubbles when the agn was active there , have thermalized , the magnetic fields slow down but do not stop entirely thermalization so that only a single phase gas is detected in the halo regions .",
    "the crisis of the standard cooling flow model brought about by _",
    "chandra _ and observations of galaxy clusters , has led to the development of several heating models with the aim of identifying a mechanism able to quench the cooling flow .",
    "we have used observations of virgo / m87 to inspect the dynamics of the gas in the center of the cluster , and to study the heating processes able to balance radiative losses .",
    "we combined the observations of three satellites , namely , _",
    "chandra _ and _ beppo - sax_. by means of the spectral deprojection technique , we inferred the profiles for the temperature @xmath10 and the electron density @xmath12 for m87 .",
    "the temperature profile drops by a factor of @xmath127 in the inner ( @xmath247 kpc ) .",
    "the electron density @xmath12 is well described by a 2-@xmath83 profile .",
    "starting from these profiles , we derived some related physical quantities such as the gravitational mass and the entropy profile .",
    "the gravitational mass profile shows a plateaux at @xmath248 kpc , which could correspond to the edge of the central cd .    in agreement with @xcite and @xcite",
    "results on a set of cluster , we found that the thermal conduction in m87 can balance the cooling flow only in the outer part of the core ( say , @xmath249 kpc ) , while in the inner @xmath126 kpc , where the temperature profile becomes flatter and the conduction is no longer efficient , some extra - heating is required .",
    "we have determined the extra - heating needed to balance the cooling flow in m87 , assuming a thermal conduction efficiency @xmath158 with respect to the spitzer value , and an outflow mass rate @xmath250 .",
    "the high quality of our combined dataset allows us to inspect properly the innermost regions , deriving an accurate profile for the extra - heating term @xmath251 in the regions where thermal conduction is not sufficient to quench the cooling flow .",
    "several models and simulations concerning heating mechanisms through buoyant gas in the cluster icm have been recently proposed in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "we have assumed that the heating is provided by the central agn by means of deposition of buoyant bubbles in the icm according to the model proposed by @xcite .",
    "the bubbles rise through the icm and expand doing work on the surrounding plasma and heating it up .",
    "we fitted the extra - heating required in m87 , with the heating functions proposed by rb02 ( see eqs .",
    "[ eq : hbr ] - [ eq : qint ] ) .",
    "the rb02 model seems suitable to describe the behavior of the data . by fixing the adiabatic index @xmath252 ( relativistic bubbles ) , we find a scale radius @xmath192 kpc and @xmath253 , which corresponds to a central agn luminosity @xmath254 .",
    "the scale radius is of the order of the extension of the agn jet and the inferred agn luminosity is similar to the one estimated by @xcite and @xcite @xmath255 .",
    "smaller conductivity efficiencies ( @xmath204 ) or larger outflow mass rates ( @xmath256 ) provide agn luminosities ( @xmath257 ) which are somewhat higher than the estimations of @xcite and @xcite . however , if the efficiency of the thermal conduction is reduced ( @xmath204 ) the model functions of rb02 seem no longer suitable to describe the heating needed to balance the cooling flow . for higher conduction efficiencies ( @xmath258 ) or smaller outflow rates values ( @xmath259 ) the inferred luminosity",
    "is slightly reduced ( @xmath260 ) .",
    "the different values derived for @xmath173 are of the same order of the luminosity measures for the agn luminosity in m87 obtained by @xcite and @xcite . in all the cases considered ,",
    "the inferred scale radius @xmath175 , which fixes the radius at which bubbles are deposited and start rising , is @xmath210 kpc which approximatively corresponds to the agn jet extension .    finally , we discussed a scenario where the bubbles are filled with relativistic particles and magnetic field , responsible for the radio emission in m87 . in this scenario",
    "the density contrast @xmath225 is expected to be as large as 1 .",
    "the buoyant velocity @xmath211 of the bubbles can be derived by balancing the buoyant force with the drag force .",
    "for small bubbles , the rise velocity is subsonic . under the hypothesis of equipartition between relativistic particles and magnetic field in the bubbles and of equilibrium pressure with the thermal icm",
    ", we evaluated the filling factor @xmath132 of the radio bubbles .",
    "we find @xmath261 which is of the same order of the filling factor of the cool thermal component observed in the regions of the radio lobes ( m02 ) .",
    "hence , we suggest that this cool thermal component is structured in blobs tied to the radio bubbles . the thermal conduction , which should rapidly thermalized the cool blobs , is suppressed by the magnetic fields of the radio bubbles .",
    "the density contrast of the buoyant bubble+blob system is @xmath262 further reducing the rising velocity .",
    "the radio galaxies are likely to be intermittent on a timescale @xmath263 yr and they are supposed to heat the icm through a succession of outbursts . during each outburst a population of radio bubbles is injected into the icm .",
    "the bubbles rise buoyantly in the intracluster gas , heating it up .",
    "the outbursts follow each other on small timescale @xmath179 which is much shorter than the rise timescale @xmath264 yr of the bubbles so that the mechanism is isotropic throughout the cluster and approaches the steady state .",
    "the x  ray cool blobs are detected in the radio lobes where the injection of radio bubbles is occurring at the present time .",
    "the blobs are tied to the radio bubbles so that the thermal conduction is highly suppressed by the magnetic fields . in the radio halo ,",
    "the radio bubbles injection occurred in the past .",
    "the radio bubbles are buoyantly rising in the cluster atmosphere and it is likely that the x  ray cool blobs which were tied to the bubbles when the agn was active in those directions , have in the meanwhile thermalized so that only a single phase thermal component is present here .    the authors wish to thank luigina feretti and mariachiara rossetti for useful discussions .",
    "the authors are pleased to acknowledge the referee c. kaiser whose useful comments and suggestions have significantly improved the paper .",
    "by using eq . ( [ eq : depro ] ) the deprojected variable @xmath62 is obtained from @xmath63 by subtracting off the contribution of the outer shells , starting from the outermost annulus and moving inwards .",
    "this basic prescription assumes that there is no emission beyond the maximum radius @xmath77 .",
    "thus , the basic recipe ( [ eq : depro ] ) must be corrected to account for a contribution to the x  ray spectra from the gas beyond @xmath77 .        where @xmath266 is the area of the ring , @xmath63 the variable to be deprojected and @xmath267 the correction factor of the ring .",
