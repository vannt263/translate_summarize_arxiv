    "given the forthcoming operation of the lhc , perhaps the dominant role of experimental flavor studies in particle physics will be supplanted by discoveries in the so - called new physics .",
    "even if flavor physics faces an unsure future , all would acknowledge its remarkable recent progress via the observation of rare phenomena such as cp - violation in @xmath5-mesons or particle - antiparticle mixing for @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons .",
    "if new physics is indeed observed , the continued exploration of rare observables could well be an asset in deciphering exotic lhc events .",
    "my purpose in this talk is to describe two recent theoretical contributions to @xmath7 mixing  @xcite . both ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite should be considered in the context of the recent hfag values  @xcite , @xmath8 in light of the physical review letters criteria of observation ( @xmath9 ) or evidence ( @xmath10-to-@xmath11 ) , we see that the above @xmath12 determination for @xmath13 amounts to a measurement ( @xmath14 ) . as such , we all await improvments in sensitivity for charm mixing .",
    "the observed signal is seen to occur at about the @xmath15 level .",
    "whether or not this is the magnitude expected for the sm signal is a topic i will discuss shortly . at any rate ,",
    "i wish to also consider the possibility of a np component in @xmath7 mixing amplitude , @xmath16 the relative phase between @xmath17 and @xmath18 is not known .",
    "thus , in our detailed study of various np contributions to @xmath13 in ref .",
    "@xcite we most often compared the np predictions to @xmath19 windows relative to the central @xmath13 value of eq .",
    "( [ xy ] ) .      an important technical aspect of refs .",
    "@xcite is the process of relating an amplitude at some np scale @xmath20 to one at , say , the charm scale @xmath21 .",
    "this takes the form @xmath22 where the prefactor @xmath23 has the dimension of inverse - squared mass , the @xmath24 are dimensionless wilson coefficients , and the @xmath25 are the effective operators . at the leading order of dimension six , it turns out that there are _ eight _ four - quark operators , @xmath26 any given np contribution will often involve several of these , but in all events never more than these eight .",
    "the evolution is determined by solving the rg equations obeyed by the wilson coefficients , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the @xmath29 anomalous dimension matrix  @xcite .",
    "the output of this calculation is a set of rg factors @xmath30 which are expressed in terms of ratios of qcd fine structure constants evaluated at different scales , _",
    "e.g. _ as with @xmath31      one needs ultimately to evaluate the @xmath7-to-@xmath32 matrix elements of the eight operators @xmath33 . in general , eight non - perturbative parameters would need to be evaluated by some means such as a lattice determination .",
    "as a practical matter , the method used in refs .",
    "@xcite is to introduce a ` modified vacuum saturation ' ( mvs ) , where all such matrix elements are written in terms of the known matrix elements of ( v - a)@xmath34(v - a ) and ( s - p)@xmath34(s+p ) matrix elements @xmath35 and @xmath36  @xcite , @xmath37 where the number of colors is @xmath38 and , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we define @xmath39 with the above theoretical machinary in hand , we are now ready to consider sm and np contributions to @xmath7 mixing .",
    "one can use quarks or hadrons as the basic degrees of freedom in carrying out the sm analysis of @xmath7 mixing . in principle",
    ", these should give the same result .",
    "however , as we shall see , rather different features appear in each description .      at leading order in the sm , the ope for @xmath7 mixing consists of two dimension - six four - quark operators  @xcite .",
    "the next order contains fifteen dimension - nine six - quark operators . for each increasing order in the ope , there are still more local quark and gluon operators and the problem of determining operator matrix elements becomes ever more severe .",
    "for this reason , the dimension six sector has received by far the most attention .    .",
    "]    the dimension six amplitude is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : loop ] .",
    "since the @xmath40-quark is essentially decoupled due to the tiny @xmath41 value , only the light @xmath42 quarks propagate in the loop .",
    "the cabibbo dependence of this diagram , @xmath43 , itself seems to suggest that the experimental signal ( near the @xmath44 level ) is easily understood .",
    "but not so fast ! for convenience , let us set @xmath45 .",
    "then the only mass ratio that appears in the problem is @xmath46 table  [ tab : qkmix ] examines one of the loop - functions for @xmath1 and shows the results of carrying out an expansion in powers of @xmath47 .",
    "we see that the contributions of the individual intermediate states in the mixing diagram are _ not _ intrinsically small  in fact , they begin to contribute at @xmath48",
    ". however , flavor cancellations remove all contributions through @xmath49 for @xmath1 , so the net result is @xmath50 .",
    "charm mixing clearly experiences a remarkable gim suppression !",
    "we understand the reason for this .",
    "@xmath7 mixing vanishes in the limit of exact su(3 ) flavor symmtery .",
    "it is nonzero only because flavor su(3 ) is broken , and indeed , @xmath7 mixing occurs at second order in su(3 ) breaking  @xcite .",
    "a factor of @xmath47 will accompany each order of su(3 ) breaking and the rate difference @xmath51 will experience an additional factor of @xmath47 due to helicity suppression .",
    ".flavor cancellations in @xmath1 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     .05in[tab : bigtable ]    the broad menu of np models which were analyzed is listed in table  [ tab : bigtable ] .",
    "the extensive content of this list ( _ e.g. _ there are _ four _ different susy realizations and _ three _ involving large extra dimension ) indicates how rich the field of np models has become .",
    "of course , the subject of np is by now fairly mature ( in preparing this talk , i realized that my first paper on charged higgs bosons  @xcite was written nearly 30 years ago ! ) and thus many models have been well exposed to the scrutiny of experiment .",
    "this would seem to imply that parameter spaces for the various models have shrunk so much that a measurement like @xmath7 mixing would have little impact .",
    "in fact , in giving this talk in several venues i challenged each audience to predict how many of the 21 models considered here were constrained by the @xmath7 mixing values or equivalently how many evaded constraint . before answering this question",
    ", we consider a specific np example in some detail .",
    "suppose a _",
    "vector - like _ quark of charge @xmath52",
    "@xcite is added to the sm .",
    "recall that a vector - like quark is one whose electric charge is either @xmath53 or @xmath54 and which is an @xmath55 singlet .",
    "both choices of charge are actually well motivated , as such fermions appear explicitly in several np models .",
    "for example , weak isosinglets with @xmath56 appear in @xmath57 guts  @xcite , with one for each of the three generations ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath5 ) .",
    "weak isosinglets with @xmath60 occur in little higgs theories  @xcite in which the standard model higgs boson is a pseudo - goldstone boson , and the heavy iso - singlet @xmath61 quark cancels the quadratic divergences generated by the top quark in the mass of the higgs boson .",
    "[ t ]    -exchange .",
    "[ qfig2],width=151 ]    we restrict our attention here to the @xmath60 case . since the electroweak quantum number assignments are different than those for the sm fermions , flavor changing neutral current interactions will be generated in the left - handed up - quark sector .",
    "thus , there will also be fcnc couplings with the @xmath62 boson  @xcite .",
    "these couplings contain a mixing parameter @xmath63 which is constrained by the unitarity condition @xmath64 a tree - level contribution to @xmath65 is thus generated from @xmath62-exchange ( see fig .",
    "[ qfig2 ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate that @xmath66 where we have made use of eq .",
    "( [ setofoperators ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ me_mvs ] ) .",
    "the result is displayed in the graph of fig .",
    "[ singletquark23fig ] , which contrasts a @xmath67 window ( dashed lines ) about the hfag central value with the np prediction @xmath68 ( solid line ) , as a function of the mixing parameter @xmath63 .",
    "the bound on @xmath63 from @xmath7 mixing turns out to be roughly two orders of magnitude better than that from the ckm unitarity constraint .     as a function of the mixing parameter @xmath63 in units of @xmath69 in the @xmath52 quark singlet model .",
    "the @xmath70 experimental bounds are as indicated , with the yellow shaded area depicting the region that is excluded.,width=302 ]    upon performing analogous analyses for the other np models , we arrive at a set of constraints ( mainly in the form of graphs ) like the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ singletquark23fig ] .",
    "it is not possible here to summarize the results for all 21 models of table  [ tab : bigtable ] .",
    "one must refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for that . however , we can answer the question raised earlier about how many models avoid being meaningfully constrained by the @xmath7 mixing data .",
    "the answer is just 4 of the 21 models , which came as a surprise to many .",
    "these 4 models are split susy , universal extra dimensions , lr symmetric and flavor - conserving higgs doublet .",
    "it is of interest to briefly consider a few of these , in order to understand how the @xmath7 mixing constraints can be evaded :    1 .",
    "split susy  @xcite : this is a relatively new variant of susy ( 2003 - 4 ) in which susy breaks at a very large scale @xmath71  tev .",
    "all scalars except the higgs have mass @xmath72 whereas fermions have the usual weak - scale mass .",
    "it is known that large @xmath7 mixing in susy will involve squark amplitudes .",
    "but since squark masses in split susy are huge , the mixing becomes suppressed .",
    "universal extra dimensions  @xcite : ued is a variant of the idea that tev@xmath73-sized extra dimensions exist .",
    "there are no branes appearing in this approach , so all sm fields reside in the bulk and just one extra dimension is usually considered .",
    "each sm field will have an infinity of kk excitations .",
    "it turns out that gim cancellations suppress all but a few b - quark kk terms , but these are ckm inhibited .",
    "so we see that supressions can arise from more than one source and that the suppressing mechanism will depend on the specific model .",
    "at long last , signals for @xmath13 and @xmath51 have been observed . these experimental findings ,",
    "although greatly welcome , whet our appetite for ever more precise determinations .",
    "hopefully these will be forthcoming , so we can put aside any lingering concerns that all the excitement has been the result of statistical fluctuations .    the sm analysis , as is so often the case , is not without its difficulties . at the quark level , theoretical analysis in the dimension six sector through nlo gives @xmath74 .",
    "these values are tiny compared to the reported experimental signals .",
    "it is evident that the triple sum over the operator dimension @xmath75 , the qcd coupling @xmath76 and the mass expansion parameter @xmath47 of eq .",
    "( [ mr ] ) is slowly convergent .",
    "this approach remains inconclusive at best .",
    "a more promising avenue is to study @xmath51 with the hadronic degree of freedom .",
    "this yields a plausible , and quite possibly correct , explanation for reaching the @xmath77 level . again",
    ", however , the effect of strong interaction uncertainties mars predictive power .    finally , the work of refs .",
    "@xcite has explored which np models can yield sizable values for @xmath13 , @xmath51 and which can not .",
    "charm mixing data has been found to infer useful constraints on np parameters spaces , and as should be clear to all , provides a most welcome addition to the high energy physics community .",
