    "the total mass of a cluster of galaxies is dominated by dark matter , which couples only through gravity with ordinary matter .",
    "therefore , to map the density profile of a cluster , one needs to find how luminous matter in a cluster is related to its gravitational potential .",
    "each way of doing so leads to a method of cluster mass mapping . assuming some sort of dynamical balance established",

    "an extended object in a non - uniform gravitational field feels a distorting tidal force .",
    "the tidal force from the mass of a cluster can change the shape of its galaxies in a way that the radial orientation angles ( see the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : illu ] for an illustration ) of elliptical galaxies in a cluster show an anisotropic distribution toward the cluster center different from the isotropic distribution of field galaxies ; this phenomenon is referred to as radial alignment ( ra ) .",
    "if ra really exists and is caused by the tidal effect of the cluster mass , then a new link between an observable , i.e. the radial angle distribution ( rad ) of elliptical galaxies , and the gravitational potential of the cluster can be found .",
    "the idea that the cluster tidal force can cause ra was first proposed by thompson @xcite , in order to explain  a possible indication that the galaxies are preferentially aligned along the radius vector to the center of the cluster \" for the coma cluster @xcite . in recent years",
    ", more observational evidence has been found to support this idea @xcite . theoretically , @xcite studied the dynamical process of shape changing of an elliptical galaxy under the cluster s tidal field using n - body simulations , and showed an alignment tendency between the galaxies major axes with the radial direction",
    ". @xcite found strong ra of dark matter substructures in a cluster halo in n - body simulations .",
    "@xcite studied a gaseous ellipsoid of uniform density orbiting in the logarithmic potential , and discussed the application of their result to the alignment of galaxies in rich clusters .",
    "they concluded that inside a critical radius , galaxies would be disrupted by the tidal force of the cluster , whereas beyond the critical radius the major axes of elliptical galaxies are locked in radial direction .",
    "none of the previous works take the intrinsic ellipticity distribution of galaxies into consideration . in @xcite",
    "all elliptical galaxies intrinsic shape were set spherical , unlikely in real cases . in our work , the ellipticity distribution of field elliptical galaxies , which can be thought unaffected by environment , is used as the intrinsic ellipticity distribution .",
    "this work aims to formulating an analytic model to simulate ra quantitatively .",
    "section 1 is to verify qualitatively that the shape changing timescale for most galaxies in a cluster is short enough compared with the keplerian motion period so that we can ignore the dynamical process of tidal distortion and assume an equilibrium shape of the galaxy . in section 2",
    "we calculate the equilibrium shape of an elliptical galaxy analytically .",
    "then the projection effects are included and rad is generated by a monte - carlo method .",
    "finally the observed rads of the clusters abell  2744 are compared .",

    "the einstein summation convention is used in this work .",
    "we define a tidal potential corresponding to the tidal force , which is @xmath7    the mass distribution of the cluster is treated as spherically symmetric , so its gravity acting on a mass element can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the enclosed mass in radius @xmath5 , and @xmath10 denotes the gravity potential caused by the mass gradient . here since @xmath11 @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath12 substituting equations  ( [ p_c ] ) and ( [ p_c_l ] ) into equation  ( [ t_p ] ) , and neglecting the variation of @xmath9 in small scale , we obtain @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the component of @xmath4 along @xmath0 , and @xmath15 is the perpendicular component , which are illustrated in fig .

    "we find that the galaxies with @xmath47 only compose 0.1% the volume of the cluster .",
    "thus for a rich cluster like a2744 , the condition @xmath48 is satisfied for most galaxies , which means that the tidal force is weak compared with the self - gravity of these galaxies .",

    "it follows that the galaxy will remain close to the stationary equilibrium state determined by the instantaneous value of the tidal potential , where the equilibrium shape of the galaxy will coincide with the iso - potential surface of the equilibrium state @xmath56 .",
    "undoubtedly , an elliptical galaxy with a central luminous ellipsoid and dark matter halo component is a very complex entity , and therefore , we need to assume some necessary simplifications and assumptions in order to be able to study mathematically the deformation of such a complicated system under the tidal force from a cluster .",
    "since we only consider the tidal distorsion within the effective radius @xmath57  kpc , therefore hereafter the effect of dark matter is neglected ( see section 2 for details ) .",

    "comparing the observed rads in fig .",
    "[ fig : observe ] with the simulated ones in fig .",
    "[ fig : shi ] , we conclude that the observed non - uniform rads are due to the tidal effects of these clusters .    in our model ,",
    "the gravitational interaction between two nearby galaxies is neglected .",
    "we treated the galaxies as if they were moving under a smooth averaged field .",
    "in fact when two galaxies get close , the tidal effects from the nearby galaxy will weight over the entire cluster .",
    "this will increase the randomness of rad of the whole cluster , because encounter events are random and the effects are local .",
    "the non - spherical symmetry and substructures of the cluster are also not included , since we applied the isotropic nfw mass profile .",
    "those effects will be included in our following works .",
    "our simulations place galaxies in the region where the self - gravity of the galaxies are far greater than the tidal force from the cluster , so tidal disruption of galaxies has not been taken into consideration .    in section 2",
    ", we assumed that a galaxy has a trace - free quadrupole oscillation under the weak tidal distorsion like a star with a period @xmath146  gyr .",
    "however , an elliptical galaxy is a stellar system rather than a fluid system , and the oscillation can be quickly damped by landau damping @xcite .",
    "therefore , the time needed from the beginning of deformation to finally settling on the equilibrium state is indeed the damping time scale @xmath147 , if @xmath148 . in a finite stellar system like an elliptical galaxy , the time scale of damping the quadrupole oscillation ( *",
    "* @xmath149 mode ) is shorter than @xmath150 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "therefore an elliptical galaxy will remain on the stationary equilibrium after @xmath151 , which is also shorter than @xmath152 .",
    "therefore @xmath56 is a good approximation , where @xmath72 is instantaneous .    in the monte - carlo simulations , the initial ellipticity distribution and the effective density of the galaxies",
    "are chosen as those of field galaxies .",
    "there is evidence showing that differences might exist between the density of cluster galaxies and field galaxies @xcite ; it is however possible that these differences are caused by the tidal effect we calculated here , which may change the density and ellipticity distributions of the member galaxies of a cluster .",
    "although different initial ellipticity distribution and effective density chosen do not change our conclusion qualitatively , these will become important when analyzing rad quantitatively .",
    "the effects of weak lensing are also not taken into consideration , which would cause images of some of galaxies in the far and back side of the cluster stretched along the tangential direction , and thus may weaken the observed ra by the tidal force of the cluster .",
    "finally , in this work we aim to study the possibility of radial alignment of elliptical galaxies , the original orientations of which are random , under the tidal force in a cluster .",
    "there are certainly other possibilities of radial alignment ; for example , the galaxies entering the cluster could be radially pre - aligned , since tidal forces are ubiquitous .",
    "however , the issue is beyond the scope of the present work , and could be an interesting topic of future investigations .",
    "it is possible to even infer the original orientation and ellipticity distributions of galaxies by studying the observed distributions using our analysis method , if the gravitational field of the cluster is determined independently with other methods .",
    "once again , this could be an interesting topic of future investigations .",

    "<S> unlike the random radial orientation distribution of field elliptical galaxies , galaxies in a cluster are expected to point preferentially towards the center of the cluster , as a result of the cluster s tidal force on its member galaxies . in this work an analytic model </S>",
    "<S> is formulated to simulate this effect . </S>",
    "<S> the deformation time scale of a galaxy in a cluster is usually much shorter than the time scale of change of the tidal force ; the dynamical process of the tidal interaction within the galaxy can thus be ignored . </S>",
    "<S> an equilibrium shape of a galaxy is then assumed to be the surface of equipotential , which is the sum of the self - gravitational potential of the galaxy and the tidal potential of the cluster at this location . </S>",
    "<S> we use a monte - carlo method to calculate the radial orientation distribution of these galaxies , by assuming the nfw mass profile of the cluster and the initial ellipticity of field galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the radial angles show a single peak distribution centered at zero . </S>",
    "<S> the monte - carlo simulations also show that a shift of the reference center from the real cluster center weakens the anisotropy of the radial angle distribution . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the expected radial alignment can not be revealed if the distribution of spatial position angle is used instead of that of radial angle . </S>",
    "<S> the observed radial orientations of elliptical galaxies in cluster abell  2744 are consistent with the simulated distribution .    </S>",
