    "the discovery of the non extensive nature of black hole entropy @xcite has lead to entropy bounds on matter , and to the proposal of the holographic principle ( see @xcite for a review )  a conjecture regarding the reduction of the number of degrees of freedom needed to describe a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "later , it was discovered that other thermodynamic quantities of fields in a black - hole background also scale as the surface area of its horizon , and consequently , it was hypothesized that it is the entangled nature of the quantum state of the system inside and outside the horizon , which leads to area - scaling .",
    "this view has received some support from the area - scaling properties of entanglement entropy in flat space @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study area - scaling of two point functions of a certain class of quantum field theory bulk operators in minkowski space , to be defined shortly .",
    "we shall show , under weak assumptions , that quantum expectation values of operators restricted to a region of space will scale as its surface area , regardless of the region s geometry .",
    "this area - scaling property may then be used to establish area - scaling of thermodynamic quantities @xcite , and in some sense , a bulk - boundary correspondence @xcite .",
    "the two point functions we wish to consider are the expectation values of a product of two operators which are restricted to some regions @xmath0 and @xmath1 of minkowski space . in order to restrict operators to a region @xmath2",
    ", we use operator densities @xmath3 , and define @xmath4 .",
    "we show that if the connected two point function of the operator densities @xmath5 , @xmath6 satisfies the following conditions :    * @xmath7 is short range : at large distances it behaves like @xmath8 , with @xmath9 , [ l : two ] * @xmath7 is not too singular at short distances .",
    "explicitly , we require that for small @xmath10 , @xmath11 with @xmath12 ,    and if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are finite , then the connected two point function @xmath13 is proportional to the area of the common boundary of the two regions @xmath0 and @xmath1 : @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is the boundary of @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is its area .",
    "this implies that the fluctuations ( or variance : @xmath18 ) of the operator @xmath19 scale as the surface area .",
    "in particular , the energy fluctuations inside @xmath16 will be proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "this is discussed at length in @xcite .    in section [ s : cal_of_corr ]",
    "we give a detailed proof of the area - scaling property of two point functions of bulk operators satisfying conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "section [ s : explicit_cal ] contains an explicit calculation of energy fluctuations , and fluctuations of the boost operator .",
    "we discuss these results in section [ s : discussion ] .",
    "we shall first give a general explanation as to why conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) are required for area - scaling , and outline the proof for area - scaling of two point functions .",
    "a more detailed discussion will then follow .    in order to evaluate @xmath20",
    ", we may express it as follows , @xmath21 the integral has been factored into a product of a purely geometric term @xmath22 , and an operator dependent term @xmath23 . using @xmath24 , we may integrate eq.([e : ov1ov2 ] ) by parts .",
    "the surface term then vanishes due to conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) , and we get @xmath25    to proceed we note that the geometric term is of the form : @xmath26 we show in the next subsection that @xmath27 , with @xmath16 a volume term , @xmath28 a surface area term , and g numerical coefficients .",
    "there are some geometries for which this scaling is more obvious : for example , if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are disjoint volumes with a common boundary which may be approximated as flat , then one may carry out the integral in eq.([e : defofdv1v2 ] ) by switching to ` center of mass coordinates ' @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . restricting the value of @xmath31 to be equal to @xmath10 , results in confining @xmath32 to be , at most , a distance of @xmath33 from the boundary .",
    "the integral over the @xmath32 coordinate will give a term proportional to @xmath34 , s being the area of the boundary .",
    "the remaining integral over the @xmath35 coordinate will give a term proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "combining these results , we get the claimed form of @xmath37 ( the volume term vanishes in this case ) .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath38 . in this case",
    "an integral over the center of mass coordinate @xmath32 will yield , to leading order , a volume dependent term .",
    "the remaining integral over the @xmath35 coordinate will give the appropriate powers of @xmath10 .",
    "using these two simple cases , one can now construct @xmath37 for general geometries by dividing one of the volumes , say @xmath0 , into sub - volumes which are either contained in @xmath1 , just touching @xmath1 , or disconnected from @xmath1 . in order for the appropriate form of @xmath37 to follow",
    ", one would need that the coefficient @xmath39 be exactly the same for both cases described above .",
    "this requires a more detailed calculation and is shown in the following subsection .",
    "going back to eq.([e : partshandwaving ] ) , we observe that the integral comes from the region @xmath40 , and that the contribution of the volume dependent term of @xmath37 will vanish @xmath41 .",
    "the leading contribution to the integral will come from the surface term , which gives area - scaling behavior of two point functions , as claimed .",
    "the vanishing of the contribution of the volume term is a result of properties ( i ) and ( ii ) of @xmath42 , which make the surface term vanish when integrating eq.([e : ov1ov2 ] ) by parts , and of the special polynomial dependence of @xmath43 on @xmath10 .",
    "as we have shown schematically , the area - scaling properties of correlations depend on the properties of the geometric term defined in ( eq.([e : defofdv1v2 ] ) ) . in this subsection",
    "we shall study it in some detail .",
    "first we note that there exists a @xmath44 and @xmath45 , such that @xmath46 for @xmath47 or @xmath48 : define @xmath49 . for @xmath50",
    "there are no values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 which will have a non zero contribution to the integral , and therefore @xmath46 for this region .",
    "similarly @xmath53 .    for the cases where @xmath54 ( that is , the closed sets @xmath0 and @xmath1 are not disjoint ) , we shall show that @xmath43 satisfies @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath39 are constants which depend only on the dimensionality of space , explicitly @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 is the common boundary of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath59 is the part of the boundary when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are on opposite sides of the boundary , whereas @xmath60 is the part of the boundary when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are on the same side of the boundary .",
    "the first term is a volume dependent term .    to solve the integral ( [ e : defofdv1v2 ] ) we switch to a ` center of mass ' coordinate system ( shown in fig .",
    "[ f : def_of_coords ] ) : @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , so that @xmath35 points from @xmath61 to @xmath62 , and @xmath32 points to the middle of @xmath35 ( since @xmath63 ) . in this new coordinate system , @xmath64    in order to carry out the integration",
    ", we wish to use a generalized ` radial ' coordinate @xmath65 such that @xmath66 will define the boundary @xmath67 of @xmath0 , and generalized ` angular ' coordinates @xmath68 which will define solid angles on the boundary .",
    "to define such a coordinate system we foliate space into surfaces which , when very close to @xmath67 , are parallel to it .",
    "@xmath65 is chosen to be the coordinate which points to different leaves of the foliation .",
    "@xmath66 , as stated , defines the surface @xmath67 .",
    "we also choose @xmath65 such that for a point @xmath32 for which @xmath69 is small enough , then @xmath69 will specify the distance of @xmath32 from the boundary . @xmath68",
    "are generalized angles on each hyper - surface .",
    "the unit volume in this coordinate system is @xmath70    for the vector @xmath35 we choose a polar coordinate system : @xmath71 for a given point @xmath32 , the integration over the angular coordinates of @xmath35 will give us the solid angle subtended by all allowed values of @xmath72 , when it is centered at @xmath32 . in preparation for performing the integral in eq.([e : dv1v2integral ] ) for a general geometry ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : general case ] ) we first consider several particular cases .",
    "+ * case 1 * : regions which have a common boundary , but no common interior .",
    "here we expect to have @xmath73    fixing @xmath10 to have some small value , we look at all values @xmath35 is allowed to have for a fixed value of @xmath32 . defining @xmath74 , then since @xmath61 and @xmath62 are on different sides of the boundary @xmath75 , @xmath32 is restricted to a distance of @xmath33 from @xmath76 ( see fig.[f : range_of_r ] ) .",
    "therefore @xmath77 in this case @xmath78 is the region of angular integration for each leaf of the foliation .",
    "we denote the range of angles which define the common boundary as @xmath79 , so that @xmath80 we note that with this definition we may also write @xmath81    for a certain point @xmath82 close to the boundary : @xmath83 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ f : allowed_r_1 ] ) , the angular integration over @xmath35 will be restricted to a region @xmath84 .",
    "therefore we have : @xmath85    changing variables to the dimensionless variable @xmath86 , and integrating over the angular coordinate @xmath87 we obtain , @xmath88 this is an exact expression .    expanding the integrand on the r.h.s .",
    "of eq.([e : dlem1exact ] ) in powers of @xmath10 , we obtain @xmath89 where @xmath90 we will show that @xmath87 is a function of @xmath91 only , and obtain an explicit expression for it .    for very small @xmath10 , we look at a point @xmath32 , a distance @xmath83 from the boundary , and calculate the solid angle subtended by a vector @xmath35 centered at @xmath32 whose one end is in @xmath0 , and other end is in @xmath1 .",
    "since we are taking the limit where @xmath40 , the shape of the boundary close to the point @xmath32 may be considered flat ( shown in fig .  [ f : allowed_omega_1 ] ) .",
    "therefore @xmath87 is the solid angle generated by @xmath35 when very close to a flat surface .    defining the z - axis as the axis perpendicular to the surface",
    ", we get that the angle @xmath92 between the z - axis and @xmath35 can range over values from @xmath93 to @xmath94 , with @xmath95 for @xmath96 and @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "note that in any case @xmath99 , implying that @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath101 , @xmath102 we note that @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the partial beta function .",
    "the full solid angle of a d - dimensional sphere is given by @xmath105 putting eq.([stam1 ] ) into eq.([e : dlem1expansion ] ) , we get @xmath106 integrating over the angular coordinates we are left with @xmath107 and plugging this into eq.([e : dlem1exact ] ) , will give us : @xmath108\\\\ \\label{e : lem1complem2 }      & = \\frac{\\xi^{d}}{2}c_d s(b )          \\int_{0}^1          \\left (              1-\\frac{b_{\\zeta^2}(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{d-1}{2})}{b(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{d-1}{2 } ) }          \\right )          d\\zeta          + \\mathcal{o}(\\xi^{d+1}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so now we have to evaluate the integral @xmath109 which can be done by changing the order of integration .",
    "the result is that @xmath110    expressing the beta function as a product of gamma functions , and using the explicit expression @xmath111 , we get the final result @xmath112 + * case 2 * : next we consider geometries where @xmath113 , for which we expect to have : @xmath114    we consider the same foliation of space as before . in this case , even at small @xmath10 , we integrate over points inside @xmath16 .",
    "the angular integration over @xmath35 will be constrained only when the region where @xmath32 is a distance of @xmath33 from the boundary .",
    "therefore : @xmath115 the first expression is the unconstrained part , and the second expression is the constrained part .",

    "we shall have : @xmath126 consider @xmath0 and its complement in @xmath1 : @xmath127 .",
    "we may write @xmath128 .",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath127 are disjoint sets with a common boundary , therefore they satisfy the conditions of case 1 . applying the results of case 1 to @xmath0 and @xmath127",
    "we get @xmath129 using case 2 to calculate @xmath130 , we find that the surface terms in @xmath131 exactly cancel each other .",
    "+ * case 4 * : @xmath0 is contained in @xmath1 and they do have a common boundary . in this case",
    "the result is that @xmath132    defining the common boundary of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as @xmath133 , we consider @xmath134 , the complement of @xmath1 . since @xmath1 and @xmath134 have the same boundary then @xmath135 .",
    "since the interior of @xmath134 is disjoint from the interior of @xmath0 ( @xmath136 ) , it satisfies the conditions for case 1 , so that @xmath137 . using case 3",
    ", we also have that @xmath138 , so that @xmath139 , which gives the deired result . +",
    "* case 5 * : @xmath0 and @xmath1 have no common boundary and are not disjoint .",
    "we have already seen that this is correct if @xmath0 is fully contained in @xmath1 .",
    "what is left , is to check the case when only part of @xmath0 is contained in @xmath1 . in this case",
    "we may define @xmath141 , and @xmath142 ( so that @xmath143 ) .",
    "the boundary of @xmath144 has a common boundary with @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath145 is the complement of @xmath144 relative to @xmath1 , any boundary of @xmath145 which is not a boundary of @xmath1 is also a boundary of @xmath144 , and since @xmath1 does not have a common boundary with @xmath0 , any boundary of @xmath144 which is common to @xmath0 must also be common to @xmath145 .",
    "therefore to leading order , @xmath146 we are using here somewhat imprecise notation as we are not differentiating between the set @xmath147 and its volume .",
    "+ * general geometries * : in order to avoid problems with infinities we consider :    1 .",
    "regions @xmath0 and @xmath1 whose common boundary has a finite number of connected components . 2 .   both volumes are connected .",
    "an example of regions satisfying these conditions is given in fig .",
    "[ f : general case ] .",
    "the idea is to divide @xmath1 into subsets , such that each subset of @xmath1 will either contain a single connected subset of the boundary of @xmath0 which is common to @xmath1 , or no such boundary at all : consider a single connected part of @xmath148 , which we denote by @xmath76 .",
    "we shall construct a volume @xmath149 such that ( a ) @xmath150 and ( b ) @xmath151 has no other common boundaries with @xmath0 , and does not contain a boundary of @xmath0 .",
    "this construction is achieved by first enclosing @xmath76 within a volume @xmath152 such that @xmath152 does not contain , and is far enough from , any other boundary of @xmath0",
    ". then we define @xmath153 . that @xmath154 is obvious from the definition .",
    "condition ( a ) is satisfied since @xmath76 is common to both @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "condition ( b ) is satisfied since if @xmath151 has another boundary with @xmath0 or contains a boundary of @xmath0 then this must be contained in @xmath152 or a boundary of @xmath152 , which is a contradiction .",
    "this procedure can be applied consecutively to all common components of the boundary of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in such a way that all the @xmath151 are disjoint ( if they are not disjoint we may get rid of their common part by a redefinition ) .",
    "thus we obtain a finite collection of sub - volumes @xmath157 that are contained in @xmath1 , and that satisfy @xmath158 . in words : the common boundary of the @xmath157 s with @xmath0 is equal to the common boundary of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "we also define @xmath159 , so that @xmath160 .",
    "@xmath161 will have no common boundary with @xmath0 .",
    "this follows from observing that if it does have a common boundary with @xmath0 then this boundary must not be a boundary of @xmath1 with @xmath0 since all of these appear in the @xmath157 s .",
    "since @xmath161 is the complement of @xmath162 with respect to @xmath1 , then @xmath162 must also have a boundary common to @xmath0 which is not common to @xmath1 , but this is not allowed by construction .",
    "now , @xmath163 since it satisfies the conditions in case 5 . also we note that for each @xmath164 , the interior of @xmath157 is either contained in @xmath0 or disjoint from @xmath0an observation which follows from the fact that no interior of @xmath157 contains a boundary of @xmath0 and so can not cross from the interior to the exterior of @xmath0 .",
    "this implies that for indices @xmath164 for which @xmath165 , we get @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the surface area of the common boundary of @xmath1 and @xmath0 for which , close to the boundary , the interiors are not disjoint .",
    "@xmath168 is similarly defined .",
    "we also note , that using case 4 , @xmath169 , for @xmath170 ( or @xmath171 ) .",
    "therefore , the leading order behavior of @xmath172 is @xmath173 which reduces to @xmath174 this completes the proof of our claim regarding the leading order behavior of the geometric term @xmath43 .",
    "going back to eq.([e : ov1ov2 ] ) , we can now evaluate : @xmath175    first we integrate by parts ( see eq.([e : partshandwaving ] ) ) , @xmath176 consider the surface term . for finite and non zero @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath177 vanishes and",
    "therefore the surface term vanishes .",
    "when @xmath54 , we note that at small @xmath10 , since @xmath178 , then @xmath179 and because of condition ( i ) this term vanishes .",
    "we shall see that the limit @xmath180 poses a special problem , and may require the introduction of a long - distance ( ir ) cutoff .",
    "we now have : @xmath181 where we have defined @xmath182 .",
    "since @xmath183 is constant for small @xmath10 then in order for @xmath20 to converge at the lower limit , we need that condition ( ii ) be satisfied .    introducing a short - distance ( uv ) cutoff scale @xmath184 , @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the scaling dimension of @xmath187 : @xmath188 here",
    "we have introduced explicitly the parameter ` m ' to allow for the possibility that the theory contains other dimensionful parameters in addition to @xmath184 ( such as masses , or an ir cutoff ) . for simplicity ,",
    "we have introduced a single such parameter .",
    "@xmath189 is dependent on the ( dimensionful ) geometric parameters of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "an explicit expression for @xmath186 is obtained by noting that if @xmath190 has scaling dimension @xmath191 , then @xmath192 has dimension @xmath193 , so that @xmath187 has dimension @xmath194 .",
    "also , @xmath183 scales as @xmath195^{d-1}$ ] , so that the geometric parameters in @xmath196 are now scaled to a length @xmath197 .    taking the shortest scale in the problem to be @xmath197",
    ", we wish to take the limit @xmath198 .",
    "when both regions are disjoint and @xmath199 , we find that the integral in eq.([stam2 ] ) vanishes .",
    "this is supported by numerical results where it is seen that disjoint volumes have zero covariance as long as the distance between them is larger than the uv scale @xcite . if the regions have some overlap or a common boundary then @xmath200 .",
    "since @xmath201 is constant at small @xmath10 then @xmath202 will be constant for all but very large @xmath203 .",
    "this will then allow us to evaluate @xmath20 as @xmath204 as long as there are no contributions from the ` rescaled infinity ' .",
    "writing out @xmath205 , or @xmath206 , we get that @xmath207 @xmath208 is the mutual surface area .",
    "we have established that @xmath20 scales linearly with the area of the common boundary , to leading order in the geometric parameters .",
    "the remaining terms in eq.([e : finalresult ] ) that contain additional geometric parameters , such as @xmath45 , and @xmath209 ( for @xmath210 ) , are subleading and scale with a smaller power of the area .",
    "for example , if the spatial regions are @xmath211-dimensional spheres of radii @xmath212 then the subleading terms scale as @xmath213 with @xmath214 .",
    "we would like to point out that the leading power of @xmath184 in the expansion of @xmath215 may appear in one of the subleading terms , where it would appear multiplied by one of the other dimensionful parameters which we have denoted by @xmath216 .",
    "indeed , introducing an ir scale @xmath217 in the theory may spoil the area - scaling behavior .",
    "we shall show an example of this in the next section .",
    "we have carried out several independent calculations of the energy fluctuations , and ` boost generator fluctuations ' of a free massive scalar field in various volumes @xcite .",
    "we present some of these calculations here .      as an explicit example",
    ", we wish to find the two point function for the energy operator in a volume @xmath16 of minkowski space for a free massless scalar field .",
    "this is given by @xmath218 which may be written in the form @xmath219 where for a free field theory , @xmath220    to find an expression for @xmath221 , we switch to a coordinate system where : @xmath222 in this form , we may do all angular integrations : @xmath223 switching to polar coordinates in the remaining two dimensional system : @xmath224 and noting that integrations over the @xmath225 and @xmath226 variables are independent , we can now evaluate the integral by imposing an exponential cutoff @xmath227 .",

    "treating the ir scale as a dimensional parameter of dimension -1 , we see that according to ( [ e : finalresult ] ) it may contribute a factor of @xmath217 to the fluctuations .",
    "it is a simple matter to generalize equation ( [ e : boostflucs1 ] ) to boosts in the other directions , yielding @xmath243 we get that the fluctuations are not proportional to the surface area .",
    "as stated earlier this is due to the ir cutoff we imposed on directions parallel to the boundary of half of space .",
    "we have shown that under conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) , two point functions of bulk operators restricted to some regions of minkowski space will scale as the surface area of the common boundary of the two regions , independently of their geometries .",
    "generally , one would expect that fluctuations , quantum or statistical , scale as the volume in which they are being measured , and not as the surface area of the volume . in a thermodynamic context ,",
    "fluctuations of observables represent thermodynamic quantities .",
    "energy fluctuations for example , correspond to heat capacity , which is usually extensive .    we have found instead ,",
    "that fluctuations scale as the area of the region of space in which they are being measured .",
    "we can give a thermodynamic interpretation to the quantum fluctuations that we have calculated by considering not an observer making quantum measurements inside the volume @xmath16 , but a different observer who has no access to the region outside @xmath16 .",
    "if the initial state of the system in the whole space is @xmath244 , then an observer that has no access to the region outside @xmath16 will see a state described by the density matrix @xmath245 .",
    "it is possible to show @xcite that for any operator @xmath246 which acts only inside the region @xmath16 , @xmath247 .",
    "therefore , the quantum fluctuations seen by the first observer ( which have area - scaling properties ) , are the same as the statistical fluctuations seen by the second observer . for the latter observer ,",
    "fluctuations of , say , the energy , are a measure . of the heat capacity , which according to",
    "the above result is proportional to the surface area of @xmath16 and not to its volume .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem then generalizes this result for fluctuations of other operators , implying that thermodynamic quantities have area - scaling behavior @xcite .",
    "going one step further , if the volume @xmath16 is chosen to be half of minkowski space , then @xmath248 is the density matrix for an accelerated observer @xcite .",
    "one can calculate the heat capacity of rindler space radiation by the above method , yielding , again , an area dependent quantity .",
    "this is consistent with area - scaling behavior of unruh radiation @xcite .    these area dependent fluctuations also give evidence for a boundary type theory .",
    "if one considers correlations between two operators @xmath249 , then these correlations vanish when no common boundary exists  implying that the information content of the system exists on the boundary .",
    "this line of thought is further developed in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that since , in general , @xmath250 , then when @xmath1 is the complement of @xmath0 , we get that the vacuum is an entangled state ( see @xcite for a discussion of this ) .",
    "this implies , due to bell inequalities , that such correlation functions can not be reproduced by a local classical setup .",
    "finally , a proposed application of this area - scaling behavior was recently given by @xcite to explain the harrison - zeldovich spectrum .",
