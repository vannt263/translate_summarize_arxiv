    "<S> we investigate the coupling between a quantized electromagnetic field in a cavity resonator and a coulomb interacting electronic system in a nanostructure in an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> effects caused by the geometry of the electronic system and the polarization of the electromagnetic field are explicitly taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results demonstrate that the two - level system approximation and the jaynes - cummings model remain valid in the weak electron - photon coupling regime , while the quadratic vector potential in the diamagnetic part of the charge current leads to significant correction to the energy spectrum in the strong coupling regime . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that a coupling to a strong cavity photon mode polarizes the charge distribution of the system requiring a large basis of single - electron eigenstates to be included in the model . </S>"
