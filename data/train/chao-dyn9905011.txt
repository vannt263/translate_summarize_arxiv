    "surfaces of section were conceived by poincar as a means to decompose bounded classical motion into discrete maps of the section onto itself .",
    "even if the longterm motion is chaotic in some sense , there are many important cases where the single return map is well behaved , so that the complex intermingling of trajectories results from repeated iterations .",
    "if a section is badly chosen , the first return map may well be singular and discontinuous with fractal boundaries between continuous regions .",
    "evidently , such a poincar map will not be a useful tool for the study of the classical motion .",
    "there are many systems for which no single surface exists that leads to a well behaved poincar map , though these have not been much studied for obvious reasons .",
    "it is only with the work of bogomolny @xcite that surfaces of section where brought into quantum mechanics . at first",
    "this was viewed as an essentially semiclassical extrapolation of poincar s method , while limiting the section to position space instead of the classical phase space .",
    "however , the approach of rouvinez and smilansky @xcite and prosen @xcite , allows us to define the transformation , undergone by the finite hilbert space corresponding to the section , as the product of two unitary scattering matrices .",
    "these describe the two alternative unbounded motions , obtained by substituting either side of the system by a semi - infinite tube . defining the scattering operators as @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the energy of the open system , the condition for a bound state to exist at a certain energy is just that @xmath4 , or @xmath5 has a unit eigenvalue .    the observation that a `` bad '' choice of section results in a maze of contributing orbits has a parallel in quantum mechanics that the correponding scattering exhibits multiple resonances . for example , consider the system in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . for the good choice of section ,",
    "the classical orbits return to @xmath6 after a short time on the right side , whereas the return map for @xmath7 will be very complex .",
    "this corresponds to a smooth energy dependence of all the elements of the scattering matrix @xmath8 ( for the open system obtained by joining an open tube to the left of @xmath6 ) , as opposed to a spiky energy dependence of @xmath9 due to many resonances .",
    "let us now consider the case where the system under study is actually the open system depicted in fig .  [ fig1](b ) , obtained by joining a narrow open tube to the left of @xmath7 in system ( a ) .",
    "the `` natural section '' that describes this new scattering problem would then be @xmath7 , but having seen that this is a `` bad choice '' for the closed system , we would also like to bypass it in the description of the new open system ( b ) .",
    "it may then be advantageous to decompose this open resonant system using a `` good '' section @xmath6 , just as in the case of the closed system .",
    "indeed , we may consider the latter as the limit of a family of open systems in which the `` bad '' section is pushed evermore to the left until the opening at @xmath7 has zero width .",
    "the system ( b ) will then be decomposed into the auxiliary systems of fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the novelty with respect to the closed problem is that now there are modes entering the scattering region between @xmath6 and @xmath7 from the tubes both to the left and to the right of fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) .",
    "the important point is that the classical orbits remain only a short time in the scattering region , leading to simple mappings among the surfaces @xmath6 and @xmath7 and nonresonant energy dependence of the @xmath0-matrices .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present the general method for the decomposition of a resonant scatterer into two less resonant scatterers by means of a surface of section .",
    "if the optimal decomposition renders both the resulting scatterers nonresonant , the objective is reached and the resonances will result from multiple scattering across the surface , as will be explicitly shown in sec .  [",
    "sec : resonance ] .",
    "if there is no choice of section for which one of the components is not resonant , we can clearly decompose it in the same manner and so on until all the components are nonresonant .",
    "a similar sequence of decompositions may be required for a bound system",
    ". there may not be any surface that avoids resonances in @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "the further decomposition of either scatterer proceeds exactly as for initially open systems .",
    "first we review multichannel scattering theory on the energy shell , establishing the notation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : decomposition ] , we decompose the scatterer through a surface of section .",
    "the way that the resonant structure emerges from the decomposed scatterers is described in the following section .",
    "particular attention is given to the time delay , as an overall indicator of resonance .",
    "semiclassical approximations are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : semiclassical ] .",
    "these are not valid across a discontinuity , so that the local treatment for its traversal follows in sec .",
    "[ sec : discontinuities ] .",
    "we conclude with a numerical calculation for a semiseparable scatterer which allows us to evaluate the discontinuous approximation advanced in the previous section .",
    "we also verify that the localization of resonance peaks of the time delay is accurately determined by the determinant of a quantum poincar map for the open system .",
    "we here review the theory of scattering on the energy shell so as to define the notation .",
    "careful definition of the context determines the scope of the following theory in its present form .",
    "a general scatterer connects regions where asymptotic states , modes or channels , propagate independently . without loss of generality , we may model the scatterer as a cavity connecting entrance leads@xcite . in many important cases , such as in mesoscopic devices , this structure is immediately evident , but even the scattering of waves from a localized object may be considered as radial backscattering along a tube of angular width @xmath12 . defining @xmath13 as the longitudinal coordinate along the @xmath14-th lead and letting @xmath15 represent the transverse coordinates ,",
    "the asymptotic region is specified by the requirement that , as @xmath16 , the hamiltonian @xmath17 becomes independent of @xmath13 : @xmath18 here we assume that the scattering region lies near the origin of @xmath13 and that @xmath13 is always positive in the asymptotic region .",
    "we also assume bounded motion in the transverse directions , implying that @xmath19 has a discrete infinite spectrum of states @xmath20 with energies @xmath21 .    the hilbert space for the stationary solutions of the schrdinger equation are decomposed into orthogonal subspaces in the asymptotic region of each lead .",
    "the @xmath14-th subspace is a superposition of states @xmath22 where @xmath23 in other words , the interaction between the transverse states @xmath24 is switched off as @xmath13 enters the asymptotic region .",

    "[ sec : semiseparable ] , since it already exhibits all the resonant structure of the general case . in the trivial case of a semi - infinite tube ,",
    "[ fig2](c ) , again @xmath82 and @xmath83 is given by ( [ diagonal1 ] ) , whereas @xmath84 assuming dirichlet boundary conditions at the end of the tube .",
    "it is important to remember that the generalized @xmath0-matrices defined in this section have infinite dimension .",
    "only the blocks made up of all the open channels will be unitary .",
    "for this reason , the identification of the open channels for reflection with a unitary @xmath0-matrix in ( [ scatback ] ) is only valid because there are no open transmission channels .",
    "all projections of a unitary matrix into a subspace define a dissipative matrix with eigenvalues having moduli smaller than one , unless there is no interaction with the subspace that has been projected away@xcite .",
    "the addition of closed modes does not alter the dissipative nature of the reflection matrices in the general case where transmission is present .",
    "let us assume that neither matrix @xmath11 or @xmath10 exhibits a sensitive energy dependence .",
    "as previously discussed , such a situation can always be reached in a sequence of decompositions .",
    "( even if the scatterer has a fractal structure , the wavelength settles the smallest scale of the fractal that can be resolved , and thus the number of auxiliary sections will be finite . )",
    "the sensitive energy dependence characteristic of a resonant scatterer then emerges from the possibility that one of the eigenvalues of @xmath85 or @xmath86 approaches the value one . in both cases",
    "the _ spectral determinant _ @xmath87 as we show in @xcite , any block with a smaller dimension than that of a full unitary matrix will generally have eigenvalues with moduli smaller than one . if the channels on the right are closed , @xmath88 will be unitary , for the channels with real @xmath89 , but the product with @xmath90 will still be dissipative .",
    "so we never have exactly zero in ( [ determinant ] ) for scattering situations ; indeed these singularities characterize bound states .",
    "we may consider the bound states of closed systems as the limit of scattering systems in which the channels both to the right and to the left are closed .",
    "the condition ( [ determinant ] ) is then precisely the well established condition for the existence of an eigenstate @xcite .",
    "clearly , the order of the matrices @xmath90 and @xmath88 makes no difference to the bound state theory , though it does affect the full scattering problem .",
    "for the rest of this section this effect will be unimportant , so we shall abreviate both products @xmath85 and @xmath86 as simply @xmath91 .",
    "the fact that @xmath91 is a dissipative matrix allows us to expand @xmath92 we can thus interpret the formulae for each of the various scattering submatrices as the result of multiple reflections within the resonant region , each one contributing a term to the total scattering matrix .",
    "note that ( [ geometric ] ) only converges for a scattering system . for a bound system ,",
    "this is only a formal equality .",
    "therefore , we can regularize the bogomolny theory for a closed system by considering it as the limit of a scattering system .",
    "the fact that @xmath91 is a well behaved operator with finite trace leads to the fredholm expansion @xmath93 where the spectral determinant @xmath94 and @xmath95 this is a similar expansion to that used by georgeot and prange @xcite , but their theory is a reworking of the semiclassical theory , as compared to the exact result . in practice",
    ", one must work predominantly with the open channels contemplated by the semiclassical theory ( see next section ) , but this finite matrix can be supplemented by as many closed channels as necessary to obtain convergence .",
    "the main point of the present theory is that we can define a _ resonant envelope _ for the energy dependence of all the matrix elements of @xmath0 as the graph of @xmath96 .",
    "certainly , there is a complex coupling among the different transverse states that varies smoothly with energy , so that this graph is not strictly an envelope .",
    "even so , it is only at the peaks of @xmath96 that we will find sharp resonant amplitudes of any element of the @xmath0 matrix . not all the peaks of @xmath96 will manifest themselves for a single matrix element , but it is not surprising that collective properties of the @xmath0-matrix can be much more sensitive to this function of the surface of section .",
    "indeed , the _ wigner delay time _ , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the number of open channels in @xmath0 , measures the globally resonant nature of the scatterer , _",
    "i.e. _ , the peaks in @xmath99 correspond to the energies of longest permanence in the scattering region for some channel .",
    "near such a peak , we may factor the rapidly varying part of @xmath0 in ( [ scatback ] ) , or in the more general cases , as @xmath100 where @xmath101 has no peaks .",
    "it follows that near the resonant peaks @xmath102 thus , we obtain the peaks of @xmath103 , where we define the _ section time delay _",
    "@xmath104 we shall verify the validity of this approximate form of the time delay for a numerical example in sec .  [",
    "sec : semiseparable ] .",
    "the first step towards a semiclassical approximation of the preceeding theory is the truncation of the generalized @xmath0-matrices , which are restricted to the open channels .",
    "the reflections are then described by square sub - matrices , whereas the blocks accounting for transmission will be generally rectangular .",
    "even though all the elements of ( [ transref1]-[transref4 ] ) are then well defined , this approximation introduces spurious discontinuities in their energy dependence as each new channel is opened .",
    "the semiclassical theory can only avoid these by some form of complex continuation of the classical motion .",
    "it should be noted that , even so , the discontinuities in energy do reflect some of the qualitative features of the full quantum theory , so that energy integrals may be quite reasonable . in any case",
    ", we expect that truncation will be a good approximation in an energy range with a constant number of open channels , in the limit when this number is large .",
    "we now associate the transverse eigenstates @xmath105 singled out by ebk - quantization ( see e.g. , @xcite ) on a given section @xmath106 to the invariant tori for the classical hamiltonian @xmath107 defined by ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",

    "both the new torus and the basis tori are closed curves ( for nonresonant scattering ) so there will be an even number of branches .",
    "caustics , leading to spurious singularities in ( [ miller ] ) , occur when the intersection of the tori is non - transverse , i.e. , where two intersections coalesce . in this region",
    "the matrix element should be expressed in terms of airy functions instead of ( [ miller ] ) ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as we shall discuss below , this simple picture of a returning torus that overlaps with the basis of tori is fragmented into a fractal mosaic for a very resonant system .",
    "however , we can now keep to a simple description for each nonresonant scatterer into which the section decomposes the original resonant system .",
    "it is important to note that we need not worry about the problem of quantizing a compact phase space .",
    "our torus basis is infinite , though we are concerned with the projection within a classically invariant region ( which grows with @xmath3 ) .",
    "the matrix elements among the open channels in the semiclassical approximation depend only on the classical dynamics within this region .",
    "the discrete action variables form a very privileged basis .",
    "we can not transform @xmath126 to the ( semiclassical ) @xmath127 basis without doing a fourier sum over elements @xmath128 that lie outside the open region , not defined semiclassically .",
    "the same difficulty involves passing to the @xmath129 representation of @xmath126 .",
    "however , the semiclassical evaluation of unitary transformations relies entirely on the stationary phase approximation . we can thus make ordinary semiclassical changes of bases within the allowed region by assuming that there are no stationary phase points outside it .    for scattering where",
    "the open channels are not restricted to a single lead , we must consider the conservative classical map defined on the union of several surfaces of section , as shown in fig .",
    "again , the classical motion takes place on the region ( [ restriction ] ) for each section , so that the allowed region will vary from section to section .",

    "the elements of the reflection block are still given by ( [ miller ] ) , whereas the transmission elements from the @xmath14-lead to the @xmath130-lead depend of the generating functions @xmath131 for the canonical transformation @xmath132 in the form @xmath133 \\ ; .",
