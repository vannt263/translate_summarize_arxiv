    "a fundamental obstacle for practical usage of the estimators is that a description by a finite time series will necessarily incur inaccuracies  since @xmath0 time series of length @xmath13 ( i.e. , @xmath20 quantities ) are used to estimate the independent elements of the `` true '' covariance matrix , the error committed ( the `` noise - to - signal ratio '' ) will be governed by the `` rectangularity ratio '' of @xmath7 , @xmath21 .",

    "they are important because they represent uncorrelated causes ( `` principal components , '' `` explicative factors '' ) for the correlations of the objects at the same moment of time ( the temporal index @xmath5 will thus be skipped below ) ; indeed , diagonalizing the ( symmetric and positive - definite ) matrix @xmath24 , , yields a linear decomposition , , into uncorrelated factors of variances given by the eigenvalues , .",

    "a financial interpretation is that the eigenvectors describe uncorrelated portfolios ( investments of part of one s wealth into asset @xmath4 ) while the corresponding eigenvalues quantify their risks ( this is important for the markowitz risk assessment method  @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest situation is , in which case the mean spectrum of the estimator @xmath22 ( which is known as the `` wishart random matrix ''  @xcite ) is given by the famous `` marenko - pastur ( mp ) distribution ''  @xcite ( cf .",

'' in the first approximation , , i.e. , just one factor , the market , governs the behavior of all the assets .",
    "furthermore , the eigenvectors corresponding to the intermediate peaks describe portfolios of strongly correlated assets from industrial sectors .",
    "to summarize , the bulk of the spectrum may be thought to represent a pure noise , whereas the spikes which leak out of it carry relevant information about the true structure of equal - time correlations .",
    "this use of the mp distribution for discerning the true information from noise has led to a number of `` cleaning schemes '' devised to construct a covariance matrix which better reflects experimental data . for instance , in the `` eigenvalue clipping '' method  @xcite , consists of the empirical eigenvalues lying above and their eigenvectors , while the eigenvalues below the upper mp edge , supposedly originating purely from the measurement noise , are all replaced by a common value such that the trace of the covariance matrix is unaltered .",
    "this scheme has been argued  @xcite to slightly outperform classical cleaning methods such as the `` shrinkage algorithm ''  @xcite .",
    "these discoveries commenced a series of applications of rmt to econophysics .",
    "in particular , an important research program is to construct more realistic `` priors '' @xmath24 which  unlike the trivial case above  already incorporate some features of the market , then perform the pca of the estimator @xmath22 , and compare it with empirical data .",
    "more generally , one should assume a certain jpdf @xmath36 , dependent on parameters which describe some aspects of the market dynamics , and compare the spectra of both estimators @xmath22 and @xmath23 with empirical data , thereby assessing the parameters of the selected jpdf .",
    "in particular , quite naturally , it will be demonstrated that true correlations between different assets but at the same moment of time are more visible in the spectrum of @xmath22 , while @xmath23 becomes very useful for investigating true time - lagged correlations . in the next sec .",
    "[ ss : modelsofspatialandtemporalcorrelations ] , a few such forms of the jpdf used in this paper will be introduced .      as explained above , a basic approach to distinguishing relevant information about the true correlations in a given complex system from the measurement noise inevitably present in any covariance estimator",

    "<S> the random matrix theory method of planar gaussian diagrammatic expansion is applied to find the mean spectral density of the hermitian equal - time and non - hermitian time - lagged cross - covariance estimators , firstly in the form of master equations for the most general multivariate gaussian system , secondly for seven particular toy models of the true covariance function . for the simplest one of these models , the existing result is shown to be incorrect and the right one is presented , moreover its generalizations are accomplished to the exponentially - weighted moving average estimator as well as two non - gaussian distributions , student t and free lvy . </S>",
    "<S> the paper revolves around applications to financial complex systems , and the results constitute a sensitive probe of the true correlations present there . </S>"
