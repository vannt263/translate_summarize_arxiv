    "electron - lattice coupling has profound effects on the behavior of conjugated polymers .",
    "it is responsible for the self - trapping of excited states and plays a vital role in determining the interconversion between excited states .",
    "predicting interconversion rates is important for understanding many electronic processes in conjugated polymers , _",
    "e.g. _  the determination of the singlet exciton yield in light emitting polymers .",
    "although not ( directly ) addressed here , the formation of quinoid - like structures in poly(para - phenylene ) is largely responsible for the tendency of these molecules to planarize in the excited state .",
    "electron - electron interaction is also important in conjugated polymers .",
    "it is responsible for excitons with large binding energies and a large singlet - triplet exchange gap .",
    "the inter - play of both electron - lattice and electron - electron interactions leads to a complicated , but interesting description of the excited states . in this paper",
    "we use the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite method to solve the pariser - parr - pople - peierls model - a @xmath6-electron model that treats both electron - lattice and electron - electron interactions .    poly(para - phenylene ) has a @xmath7 ground state .",
    "the lowest lying optically allowed state is the @xmath0 state , and since this is the emitting state in leds , its behavior is obviously important .",
    "another important state is the @xmath2 state . in light",
    "emitting polymers it is argued that this is the @xmath8 state@xcite , which is strongly dipole connected to the @xmath0 state and consequently plays an important role in non - linear spectroscopy . as a consequence of both strong electronic correlations and electron - lattice coupling in linear polyenes ,",
    "the relaxed energy of the @xmath2 state lies below the relaxed energy of the @xmath0 state , rendering these systems non - electroluminescent .",
    "we investigate the behavior of this state in poly(para - phenylene ) .",
    "because charge carriers are injected with arbitrary spin , triplet formation is also of importance , so we also explore the behavior of the @xmath1 state .",
    "the phenyl - based conjugated polymers are extrinsically semiconducting as a consequence of the chemical structure determined by the @xmath9 bonds in the absence of @xmath6-conjugation .",
    "thus , with all bond lengths equal there is still a semiconducting band gap .",
    "however , as for linear polyenes with extrinsic dimerization , coupling of the @xmath6-electrons to the lattice is still important , as it causes bond lengths to change resulting in exotic types of bound non - linear excitations . understanding how the non - interacting description of the excited state structures change as a consequence of electronic interactions is a key goal of this work . to facilitate this goal , we map the excited state structures of poly(para - phenylene ) into the more familiar description of mid - gap single - particle states and the associated solitons of linear polyenes .",
    "electron - lattice coupling in light emitting polymers has been investigated by a number of groups using a variety of methods .",
    "_ studied the relaxation of the @xmath10 singlet and triplet in short poly(paraphenylene vinylene ) oligomers by solving intermediate neglect of differential overlap models using multi - reference configuration interactions .",

    "@xmath11 ev in the four - ring oligomer is considerably smaller than our results as presented in section iv.b .",
    "ambrosch - draxl _ _ et al.__@xcite performed a density functional theory calculation on the ground state neutral structure of ppp , while zojer _ _ et al.__@xcite performed semi - empirical austin model 1 calculations on the ground state neutral and charged structures of ppp .",

    "we compare their predictions to ours in the results section .",
    "to our knowledge , this work presents the first large - scale calculation of the relaxation energies and geometrical structures of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 states in poly(para - phenylene ) oligomers .",
    "the experimental relaxation energies of the lowest - lying singlet exciton and doped polaron in a wide variety of polymers of different conjugation lengths has recently been presented by wohlgenannt@xcite .",
    "other experimental results are discussed in the results section , iv.b .",
    "extensive investigations of the excited states of poly(para - phenylene ) for fixed geometries within the pariser - parr - pople model , solved by the dmrg method , are described in ref@xcite .    in the next section",
    "we introduce the pariser - parr - pople - peierls model of conjugated polymers .",
    "next , we solve the pariser - parr - pople - peierls model in the non - interacting limit , namely the peierls model .",
    "we discuss soliton wavefunctions and soliton - antisoliton confinement",
    ". then we solve the full interacting model with the dmrg technique .",
    "we briefly discuss the dmrg algorithm before describing the results .",
    "finally , we summarize and conclude .",
    "the pariser - parr - pople - peierls model , @xmath12 , is a tight - binding model of the @xmath6-electrons that includes both long range coulomb interactions and electron - lattice coupling .",
    "the electrons and lattice are coupled together by the effects of changes in the bond lengths both on the one - electron transfer integrals and the coulomb interactions .",
    "we treat these effects up to first order in the change of bond length . as the density - density correlator , @xmath13 , decays rapidly with distance@xcite , it is also a reasonable approximation to retain changes in the coulomb potential for only nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "we thus define the pariser - parr - pople - peierls model as , @xmath14    @xmath15    is the bond - order operator , where @xmath16 creates an electron with spin @xmath9 in the @xmath6-orbital on site @xmath17 .",
    "the one - electron transfer integral is @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the displacement of the @xmath17th atom from its equilibrium position .",
    "thus , we define , @xmath21 as the change in length of the @xmath17th bond from its initial - undistorted - value ( determined by the @xmath9 bonds ) .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling constant is , @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the ohno potential , @xmath24 for the _ reference _ ( that is , the undistorted ) structure , where the bond lengths are in @xmath25 .",
    "we set @xmath26 ev , @xmath27 ev , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ev@xmath30 and the undistorted bond length as @xmath31 @xmath25 .",
    "the parameters used are essentially those of ref@xcite , with @xmath32 and @xmath33 chosen such that if the bond lengths are those of ref@xcite , the transfer integrals are as well , while @xmath34 was chosen to obtain good agreement with the ground state structure used in ref@xcite .    the second term on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ eq:7.1 ] ) is the change in the coulomb interactions from changes in bond length , where @xmath35 it is instructive to re - write this term as @xmath36 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ eq:7.4 ] ) . expanding and resuming",
    "we see that this term has two components .",
    "one component is the electron - phonon coupling arising from the change in the ionic potentials , @xmath37 the other component represents the changes in the nearest neighbor electron - electron interaction from the change in bond length , @xmath38 the first term on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ eq:7.1 ] ) is just the electron - phonon coupling arising from the change in the kinetic energy .",
    "notice that this model does not describe free rotations of phenyl rings relative to one another .",
    "thus , its applicability is to ladder poly(para - phenylene ) , where the stereo - chemistry causes the rings to have a planar geometry , or polymers in the solid state , where ring rotations are more restricted .",
    "as described in previous papers @xcite , by using the hellmann - feynman theorem we can derive a self - consistent equation for @xmath39 for any state , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the density - density correlator for the @xmath17th bond . @xmath42",
    "is determined by imposing constant chain lengths , @xmath43 , implying that , @xmath44 where the over - bar represents the spatial average .",
    "in this section we describe the solutions of the pariser - parr - pople - peierls model in the non - interacting limit ( @xmath45 ) , namely the peierls model .",
    "[ fi:1 ] shows the fractional change in transfer integrals for the ground state , @xmath46 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "the bonds are defined by fig .",
    "since the bonds are initially all of the same length , we see that the coupling of the @xmath6-electrons to the lattice has caused an effective ` bond ' alternation .",
    "the phenyl - ring bonds shorten while the bridging bond lengthens .",
    "this is the benzoid structure , as the phenyl - ring bonds are roughly all of the same length .    to see this effective bond alternation we define the summed bond distortions as",
    ", @xmath47 and @xmath48 then we defined the normalized , staggered and summed ` bond ' alternation , @xmath49 , as , @xmath50    fig .",
    "[ fi:4 ] shows @xmath49 for the ground state . under this mapping",
    "the phenyl ring is equivalent to a double bond ( or dimer ) and the bridging bond is a single bond . as for polyenes ,",
    "this effective alternation increases the semiconducting band gap .",
    "note that end - effects coupled to the constraint of an overall constant contour length causes the oscillations in @xmath49 : there are greater distortions in the phenyl rings at the end of the chain than in those in the middle of the chain .",
    "thus , in the middle of the chain the summed distortion in bond lengths in a phenyl ring is not quite equal and opposite to the distortion of the bridging bonds .",
    "next consider the @xmath51 excited state structure , shown in fig .",
    "this is the quinoid structure , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fi:2 ] ( b ) .",
    "in contrast to the ground state , there is now a significant variation in the bond lengths in the phenyl - ring : bonds labelled 1 shorten , while bonds labelled 2 lengthen .",
    "the bridging bond also shortens .    at first sight the excited state lattice distortions of poly(para - phenylene ) represented in fig .",
    "[ fi:1 ] do not resemble that of a linear polyene .",
    "we therefore might enquire whether the geometrical defects ( for example , solitons , polarons , _ etc . _ ) and their associated mid - gap electronic states also exist in an analogous manner in poly(para - phenylene ) . to show that bond defects do exist in an analogous manner to linear polyenes we again consider the summed bond distortions , defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq:12.11 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath51 state structure is illustrated in this way in fig .",
    "the relaxed @xmath51 state creates a ` polaronic ' structure , whereby the average bond length in the phenyl ring increases while the bridging bond length decreases , but there is no reversal in bond distortions from the ground state .",
    "this polaronic structure of excited states occurs in extrinsically semiconducting polymers where the ground state is non - degenerate : reversing the sign of the bond distortions gives a higher energy@xcite . a bond defect , or soliton , separates two regions of opposite bond distortions .",
    "creating a soliton and antisoliton pair and moving them apart creates a region of reversed bonds .",
    "thus , there is a linear confining potential between the soliton and antisoliton for large separations . as in linear polyenes ,",
    "these bond defects are also associated with mid - gap states .",
    "associated with the two - mid gap single - particle states of the excited state are a bonding , @xmath52 , and anti - bonding , @xmath53 , molecular orbital ( where @xmath17 is a site index ) .",
    "these molecular orbitals are analogous to the bonding and anti - bonding orbitals of molecular hydrogen@xcite . the molecular orbitals are constructed from localized wannier functions , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which represent the soliton and anti - soliton respectively . in particular , @xmath56 or inverting , @xmath57 and @xmath58 in linear polyenes with",
    "degenerate ground states the soliton and antisoliton are widely separated . however , as described above , they are confined in extrinsic semiconductors .",
    "this confinement is illustrated for poly(para - phenylene ) in fig .",
    "[ fi:3 ] , which shows the soliton and antisoliton probability density summed over each phenyl ring , @xmath59 we see that the soliton and anti - soliton wavefunctions are centered on neighboring phenyl rings in the middle of the chain .",
    "we now use this description of the molecular orbital defect states ( eq .",
    "[ eq:18 ] ) to describe the excited states . as first shown by ball _",
    "for _ trans_-polyacetylene@xcite , as a consequence of spin and spatial symmetries the relaxed @xmath0 and @xmath1 states have quite different solitonic characteristics .",
    "these differences become important when the spin degeneracy is lifted by electronic interactions , and they help explain the quite different geometrical distortions of these two states in the interacting limit .",
    "we first review the argument of ref@xcite .",
    "first , let us consider the singlet , @xmath60 state . we write this as , @xmath61 where @xmath62 represents the occupied sea of valence states and",
    "@xmath63 creates an electron with spin @xmath9 in the mid gap state @xmath64 .",
    "if @xmath65 and @xmath66 creates an electron in the states @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively , then @xmath69 inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq:4.20 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq:4.19 ] ) , we have @xmath70 @xmath71 creates a pair of electrons in the soliton , so it is negatively charged and spinless , while the anti - soliton contains no electrons , so it is positively charged and also spinless .",
    "similarly , @xmath72 creates a pair of electrons in the anti - soliton , while the soliton contains no electrons .",
    "the @xmath73 state is therefore a linear superposition of spinless positively and negatively charged soliton - antisoliton pairs .",
    "a similar argument applies to the triplet , @xmath74 state , @xmath75 showing that it is a linear superposition of neutral spin-@xmath76 soliton - antisoliton pairs .",
    "electronic interactions have a significant affect on these states .",
    "the spinless oppositely charged solitons of the @xmath77 state bind to form an exciton - polaron .",
    "conversely , the neutral spin-@xmath78 solitons of the @xmath79 state do not bind , but cause a locally strong lattice distortion .",
    "we investigate these structures in the next section .    to aid in our understand of exciton - polaron structures ( to be described below ) and relaxation energies , we also investigate charged ( polaron ) states in the non - interacting limit .",
    "[ fi:4 ] shows the polaronic structure associated with a doped particle .",
    "table [ ta:2 ] lists the relaxation energies of the @xmath51 , @xmath80 and charged ( polaron ) states for different oligomer lengths .",
    "we note that the relaxation energy of the @xmath51 state is considerably greater than for the polaron , and that the relaxation energies reduce as the oligomer lengths increase .",
    ".the relaxation energies of the @xmath51 , @xmath80 and charged ( polaron ) states for para - phenylene oligomers ( in ev ) calculated from the peierls model . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ ta:1 ]    table [ ta:1 ] lists the vertical and relaxed energies of the @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 states for @xmath81 and @xmath82 ring para - phenylene oligomers . as in linear polyenes@xcite ,",
    "the relaxation energy of the @xmath0 state is small , whereas the relaxation energy of the @xmath1 state is large .",
    "the experimentally determined relaxation energy of the @xmath0 state in the related polymer poly(para - phenylene vinylene ) has been reported as @xmath83 in ref@xcite .",
    "we may also deduce the relaxation energy in poly(para - phenylene ) and ladder poly(para - phenylene ) from fig .  3 of ref@xcite by noting that the ratio of the intensities of the @xmath84 to @xmath85 vibronic peaks in the absorption or emission spectra is @xmath86 , the effective huang - rhys factor .",
    "the relaxation energy is then @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the characteristic phonon frequency @xmath89 ev .",
    "thus , using @xmath90 for ladder poly(para - phenylene ) , @xmath91 for poly(para - phenylene ) and @xmath92 ev gives relaxation energies of @xmath93 ev and @xmath94 ev for ladder poly(para - phenylene ) and poly(para - phenylene ) , respectively .",
    "the larger relaxation energy for poly(para - phenylene ) is expected , as the rings are free to rotate , and this result is consistent with a calculated value of @xmath95 ev reported in ref@xcite .",
    "the relaxation energy of the @xmath0 state in the interacting limit is intermediate between the relaxation energy of the @xmath51 state and polaron in the non - interacting limit , as listed in table [ ta:2 ] .",
    "this illustrates the exciton - polaron nature of the @xmath0 state , as further discussed below .",
    "the relaxation energy of the @xmath2 state is also large , but not large enough to cause an energy level reversal of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 states .",
    "the difference in relaxation energies between the @xmath1 and @xmath0 states increases the @xmath85 energy singlet - triplet exchange gap from the vertical gap of @xmath96 ev to @xmath97 ev , in good agreement with experiment@xcite .",
    "we also see that the relaxation energy reduces with chain size , consistent with an increased delocalization of the excitations and consequently a diminished effective electron - lattice coupling , and in agreement with a wide number of experimental results@xcite .",
    "next , we consider the associated geometrical structures .",
    "these are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fi:5 ] for the normalized changes in transfer integrals and in fig .",
    "[ fi:6 ] for the staggered , summed bond distortions . as predicted ,",
    "the ground state alternation is enhanced in the interacting limit over the non - interacting limit by @xmath98 .",
    "the bond lengths , calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fi:2 ] .",
    "the @xmath99 state is now an exciton - polaron@xcite .",
    "its structure is qualitatively similar in both the non - interacting and interacting limits , as the soliton - antisoliton confinement due to linear confinement arising from the effective extrinsic bond alternation has a rather similar effect to electron - hole attraction .",
    "however , as already predicted , the @xmath100 state has a more pronounced distortion because it has some covalent character .",
    "indeed , there is a change of sign in the effective bond alternation .",
    "the middle bridging bond becomes a ` short ' bond , while the adjacent phenyl - ring become ` long ' bonds .",
    "similarly , the @xmath2 state shows a significant structural distortion , with a change of sign of the bond alternation .",
    "the lattice distortions of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 states - as defined by the summed bond distortions of eq .",
    "( [ eq:12.11 ] ) and shown in fig .  [ fi:6 ] - are qualitatively similar to those of linear polyenes with extrinsic dimerizarion@xcite .    the different relaxation energies and geometrical structures of the singlet and triplet @xmath101 states in the interacting limit",
    "is obviously related to the different kind of solitons comprising these states , as described in section [ se : ni ] . in particular ,",
    "the electronic interactions induce a strong coupling of the neutral soliton to the bond - order correlation , causing a significant distortion for the triplet state .",
    "in contrast , the charged solitons weakly couple to the bond - order correlation , and thus the singlet state is more weakly coupled to the lattice . since the @xmath2 state has an admixture of charged and neutral solitons , it also couples more strongly to the lattice than the @xmath99 state .",
    "understanding electron - lattice relaxation , self - trapping and calculating huang - rhys factors has important implications for predicting electronic processes in conjugated polymers , for example , exciton migration , recombination and inter - conversion mechanisms . by solving the pariser - parr - pople - peierls model of conjugated polymers for poly(para - phenylene ) by the dmrg method",
    "we have shown that the lattice relaxation of the @xmath0 state is quite different from that of the @xmath1 and @xmath102 states .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0 state is rather weakly coupled to the lattice and has a rather small relaxation energy @xmath3 ev .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath1 and @xmath102 states are strongly coupled with relaxation energies of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ev , respectively . by analogy to linear polyenes , we argue that this difference can be understood by the different kind of solitons present in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 states .",
    "the difference in relaxation energies of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states accounts for approximately one - third of the exchange gap in light - emitting polymers .",
    "the results of this calculation present a number of questions .",
    "first , are vertical and relaxed states solvated by the environment by the same amount ? if not , then the energy gap between the vertical and relaxed states for a polymer in the solid state will be different from that predicted here .",
    "second , is the large relaxation energy of the @xmath2 state evident experimentally ?",
    "finally , are the different relaxation energies of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states relevant to the issue of the singlet - triplet exciton fraction in light emitting polymers@xcite ?",
