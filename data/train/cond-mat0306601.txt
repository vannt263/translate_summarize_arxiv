    "lvy flights ( lfs ) are stochastic , markov processes , which differ from regular brownian motion by the occurrence of extremely long jumps , whose length is distributed according to a lvy stable law with the long tail @xmath4 , such that its second moment diverges @xcite .",
    "this property strongly contrasts the classical gaussian description of diffusion processes which possess finite moments of any given order @xcite .",
    "given their markov nature , the divergence of the variance of an lf might disqualify them as physically meaningful model processes for diffusing particles with a finite mass .",
    "yet , lfs have important applications to processes , in which no finite velocity is required , such as in the energy diffusion in single molecule spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "an impressive experimental evidence of lvy processes was reported by the group of walther in the study of the position of a single ion in a one - dimensional optical lattice , in which diverging fluctuations could be observed in the kinetic energy @xcite . from a phenomenological point of view",
    ", lfs have been used to describe the dynamics observed in plasmas @xcite or in molecular collisions @xcite .",
    "they have also been successfully applied to describe the statistics encountered in the spatial gazing patterns of bacteria @xcite , albatross birds @xcite , or even spidermonkeys @xcite .",
    "probably the earliest application of lfs , however , may be in the modelling of financial markets @xcite .",
    "lfs were shown to give rise to surprisingly rich band structures in periodic potentials @xcite .",
    "reverse engineering methods have been developed to construct a langevin system with lvy noise to produce a pre - defined steady state @xcite .",
    "we also note that the stationary state of lfs in a confining external potential is expected to approach to the one of lvy walks for long times @xcite ( the spatiotemporally coupled version of lfs which have converging moments of any order ) , and therefore the more straightforward determination of the solution for lfs can be used to gain insight into lvy walks .",
    "the theory of homogeneous lfs is pretty well understood .",
    "thus , lfs in the continuum limit can , inter alia , be described by continuous time random walks with long - tailed , asymptotic power - law jump length distributions @xcite , or alternatively by a langevin equation with @xmath3-correlated , lvy noise @xcite .",
    "both descriptions can be mapped onto the ( space- ) fractional diffusion equation @xcite @xmath5 is most easily defined in terms of its fourier transform @xcite @xmath6 . in the following we restrict our analysis to the range @xmath7 . in the limit",
    "@xmath8 , naturally , equation ( [ fde ] ) reduces to the classical diffusion equation , which described gaussian transport . from the fourier",
    "transform of equation ( [ fde ] ) , @xmath9 , we conclude that the characteristic function is @xmath10 i.e. , exactly the characteristic function of a symmetric lvy stable law of index @xmath11 @xcite . in position space , expression ( [ levychar ] ) can be represented exactly in terms of fox @xmath12-functions @xcite , but for our purposes in what follows , it is enough to remember that for large @xmath13 , we find @xmath14",
    ". also the general formulation of lfs in external potentials and in phase space seems well founded , in terms of fractional klein - kramers equations ; see , e.g. , references @xcite .",
    "however , much less is known about the actual behaviour of lfs in external potentials @xmath15 , i.e. , about the properties of the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath16 in the presence of such a @xmath15 .",
    "one of the few solved examples is the one of lfs in a harmonic potential @xcite , whose solution always follows the same stable law of index @xmath11 , like in the regular ornstein - uhlenbeck process the pdf always stays gaussian . in general , lfs in the presence of an external potential field in the overdamped case are governed by the ( space- ) fractional fokker - planck ( or einstein - smoluchowski ) equation @xcite @xmath17 which has the characteristic property that the drift term enters with the usual first order derivative and thus preserves its additive quality such that for a constant force @xmath18 the solution is given by the drift - free pdf taken at the similarity variable @xmath19 , and for a general external potential the stationary solution differs from the boltzmann distribution .",
    "this latter property is in contrast to an alternative lf model suggested in reference @xcite .",
    "an a priori unexpected behaviour of lfs was obtained recently as solution of the fractional fokker - planck equation ( [ ffpe ] ) , namely the occurrence of bimodal solutions ( pdfs with two maxima ) and the finiteness of the second moment in the presence of superharmonic potentials of the form @xcite @xmath20 note that the amplitude @xmath21 has dimension @xmath22={\\rm g}\\cdot{\\rm cm}^ { -2m}/{\\rm sec}^{2}$ ] .",
    "thus , for a potential of the form @xmath23 with @xmath24 , a turnover can be tuned from the properties of the solution of the harmonic problem ( mono - modal , diverging variance ) to a finite variance and bimodal solution by varying the ratio @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "if such bimodality occurs , it results from a bifurcation at a critical time @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "a typical result is shown in figure [ figint1 ] , for the quartic case @xmath27 and lvy index @xmath28 : from an initial @xmath3-peak , eventually a bimodal distribution emerges .",
    "note that we use dimensionless quantities in the plots , as introduced below .",
    "the location of the global maximum / maxima is displayed in figure [ figint2 ] , where the bifurcation is a distinct mark . in the same figure ,",
    "the value of the pdf @xmath29 at the newly emerging humps is compared to the value at the origin .    in what follows",
    ", we briefly review the description of lfs in external fields in terms of the langevin equation with white lvy noise and the space - fractional fokker - planck equation , as well as the properties of lfs in superharmonic potentials ; and we present two proofs , for both the finite variance in these cases and the existence of multi - modality .",
    "we then proceed to show that for potentials steeper than ( [ superharm ] ) with @xmath27 , even a tri - modal pdf can be obtained . in two phase diagrams",
    ", we can classify the existence of the different @xmath30-modal states in dependence of the potential exponent @xmath31 and the lvy index @xmath11 ; and the critical bifurcations between different @xmath30-modal domains as a function of time @xmath32 and potential exponent @xmath31 . in the appendix",
    ", we discuss the numerical methods from which the pdfs are obtained .",
    "in this section , we formulate the dynamical description of lfs on the stochastic differential ( langevin equation ) and the deterministic ( fractional fokker - planck equation ) levels . for the latter ,",
    "we also discuss the corresponding form in fourier space .        on the level of the stochastic description , our starting point is the overdamped langevin equation @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an external force with potential @xmath35 with @xmath21 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the particle mass , @xmath38 the friction coefficient , and @xmath39 represents a stationary white lvy noise with lvy index @xmath11 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we employ the white lvy noise @xmath39 such that the process @xmath40 which is the time integral over an increment @xmath41 is an @xmath11-stable process with stationary independent increments . restricting ourselves to symmetric lvy laws ,",
    "this implies the characteristic function @xmath42 the constant @xmath43 in this description has the meaning of the intensity of the langevin source , and @xmath44={\\rm cm}^{\\alpha}/\\sec$ ] .    in figure",
    "[ noise ] , we show realisations of white lvy noises for various values of @xmath11 . the sharply pronounced ` outliers ' , due to the long - tailed nature of the lvy stable distribution , are distinct , in comparison to the gaussian case @xmath8 .",
    "the langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) is still of the markov - type , and it is therefore fairly straightforward to show that the corresponding fluctuation - averaged ( deterministic ) description is given in terms of the space - fractional fokker - planck equation ( [ ffpe ] ) @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we derive solution of equation ( [ ffpe ] ) for the @xmath3-initial condition @xmath45    the space - fractional derivative @xmath46 occurring in the fractional fokker - planck equation ( [ ffpe ] ) is called the riesz fractional derivative , defined through @xmath47 where we use the following abbreviations : @xmath48 and @xmath49 for , respectively , the left and right riemann - liouville derivatives ( @xmath50 ) ; and @xcite @xmath51 is the gilbert transform operator . the definitions for @xmath52",
    "demonstrate the strongly non - local property of the space - fractional fokker - planck equation , i.e. , strong correlations in @xmath53 .",
    "passing to dimensionless variables @xmath54 with @xmath55",
    "the starting equations take the form ( we omit primes below ) @xmath56 instead of the langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) , and @xmath57 instead of the fractional fokker - planck equation ( [ ffpe ] ) , and @xmath58      if @xmath59 denotes the characteristic function ( cf ) , i.e. , fourier transform of @xmath16 , we write @xmath60 where we use the sign @xmath61 to denote a fourier transform pair . since @xcite @xmath62 and @xmath63 we obtain @xmath64 for all @xmath65 s .",
    "the equivalent of the fractional fokker - planck equation ( [ ffpe1 ] ) for the cf then follows immediately , @xmath66 with the initial condition @xmath67 and the normalisation @xmath68 the external potential @xmath15 turns into the linear differential operator in @xmath69 , @xmath70 next , making use the following ` inverse ' expressions @xmath71 and @xmath72 we obtain the explicit expression for the external potential operator , @xmath73 ( -1)^mk\\frac{d^{2m}}{dk^{2m}}h\\hat{f } , & c=3,5,7,\\ldots \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] note that for the even potential exponents @xmath74 , @xmath75 , we find the simplified expression @xmath76 we see that the force term can be written in terms of fractional derivatives in fourier space , and therefore it is not straightforward to calculate even the stationary solution of the fractional fokker - planck equation ( [ ffpe1 ] ) in the general case @xmath77 .",
    "in particular , in this latter case , the non - local equation ( [ ffpe1 ] ) in @xmath53-space translates into a non - local equation in @xmath69-space , where the non - locality shifts from the diffusion to the drift term .",
    "in the preceding section , we discussed some elementary properties of the space - fractional fokker - planck equation for lfs , in particular , we pointed out the spatially non - local character of equation ( [ ffpe1 ] ) , and its fourier space counterpart ( [ ffpef ] ) . in this section ,",
    "we determine the analytical solution of the fractional fokker - planck equation .",
    "we start with the exactly solvable stationary quartic cauchy oscillator , to demonstrate directly the occurring bimodality , and then move on to the general case .",
    "the major results will be the determination of @xmath30-modality , finite variance , and the parametric dependence of the associated bifurcations .",
    "let us first regard the case of the stationary quartic potential with @xmath78 for the cauchy - lf with @xmath79 , i.e. , the solution of the equation @xmath80 or , @xmath81 in fourier space .",
    "its solution is @xmath82 whose inverse fourier transform results in the simple analytical form @xmath83 as shown in figure [ fig0 ] , this solution has _ two global maxima _ at @xmath84 apart from a local minimum at the origin ( the position of the initial condition , that is ) and its variance @xmath85 is _ finite _ , due to the long - tail asymptotics @xmath86 .",
    "these two distinct properties for lfs will turn out to be a central theme in the remainder of this work .      returning to the general case ,",
    "we rewrite equation ( [ ffpef ] ) in the equivalent integral form , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the cf of a free ( homogeneous ) lf .",
    "this relation follows from equation ( [ ffpef ] ) via formally treating it as a non - homogeneous linear differential equation of first order , where @xmath89 plays the role of the non - homogeneity .",
    "then , ( [ ffpef ] ) is obtained from variation of constants .",
    "( differentiate equation ( [ conv ] ) to return to ( [ ffpef ] ) . )",
    "equation ( [ conv ] ) can be solved formally by iterations : let @xmath90 then @xmath91 @xmath92 etc . invoking the definition of the convolution , @xmath93 and using @xmath94 we arrive at the formal solution @xmath95 this procedure is analogous to perturbation theory , @xmath96 playing the role of the interaction term , see , for instance , reference @xcite , chapter 16 .    applying a laplace transformation , @xmath97 to equation ( [ conv1 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the fourier ",
    "laplace transform of the homogeneous lvy stable pdf .",
    "thus , we obtain the equivalent of solution ( [ conv1 ] ) in @xmath100-space : @xmath101 ^{n}\\widetilde{\\widehat{p } } _ { \\alpha } ( k , s).\\ ] ] this iterative construction scheme for the solution of the fractional fokker - planck equation will turn out to be useful below .      for the case of the unimodal initial condition",
    "@xmath102 we now proof the existence of a finite bifurcation time @xmath103 for the turnover from unimodal to bimodal pdf . at this time , the curvature at the origin will vanish , i.e. , be an inflection point : @xmath104 introducing @xmath105 equation ( [ bif ] ) is equivalent to ( note that the cf is an even function ) @xmath106    the bifurcation can now be obtained from the iterative solution ( [ conv3 ] ) ; we consider the specific case @xmath78 . from the first order approximation @xmath107 and we have @xmath108 combining these two expressions , we produce @xmath109 or , after inverse laplace transformation , @xmath110 the first approximation to the bifurcation time @xmath103 is then determined via equation ( [ bif1 ] ) , i.e. , we calculate @xmath111 to obtain @xmath112 in figure [ fig2 ] , we show the dependence of this first approximation @xmath113 as a function of the lvy index @xmath11 ( dashed line ) , in comparison to the values determined from the numerical solution of the fractional fokker - planck equation ( [ ffpe1 ] ) shown as the dotted line .",
    "the second order iteration for the pdf , @xmath114 , can be obtained with maple6 , from which in turn the second approximation for the bifurcation time is found in analogy to above procedure .",
    "the result is displayed as the full line in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the two approximative results show in fact surprisingly good agreement with the numerical result of the full pdf .      in this subsection",
    "we demonstrate that the stationary solution of the kinetic equation ( [ ffpe1 ] ) has a non - unimodal shape . for this purpose ,",
    "we use an alternative expression for the fractional riesz derivative ( compare , e.g. , reference @xcite ) , @xmath115 valid for @xmath116 .",
    "this definition can be obtained by ` regularisation ' of our definitions ( [ riesz1 ] ) to ( [ riesz2a ] ) for @xmath117 ; however , expression ( [ riesz3 ] ) is also valid at @xmath118 . in the stationary state ( @xmath119 )",
    ", we get from equation ( [ ffpe1 ] ) : @xmath120 thus , it follows that at @xmath1 ( strict inequality ) @xmath121 or , from definition ( [ riesz3 ] ) and taking into account that @xmath122 is an even function , @xmath123 from this latter relation , we can immediately obtain proof the non - uni - modality of @xmath124 , which we produce in two steps :    \\(1 ) if we assume that the stationary pdf @xmath125 is unimodal , then due to the symmetry @xmath126 , it necessarily has one global maximum at @xmath127 . in this case the integrand in equation ( [ cond ] ) must be negative , and therefore contradicts equation ( [ cond ] ) . therefore , @xmath125 is non - unimodal .",
    "\\(2 ) we can in addition exclude @xmath128 , as in this case the integrand will be positive , which is again in contradiction with equation ( [ cond ] ) .    since @xmath129 at @xmath130 , basing on statements ( 1 ) and ( 2 )",
    ", one may conclude that the simplest situation is such that @xmath131 exists with the property @xmath132 and , @xmath133 i.e. , the condition for two - hump stationary pdf for all @xmath1 . at intermittent times , however , we will show that also a tri - modal state may exist .",
    "we now derive the power - law asymptotics of the stationary pdf @xmath125 for external potentials of the form ( [ superharm ] ) with general @xmath36 . to this end",
    ", we note that at @xmath135 , it is reasonable to assume @xmath136 since the region of integration for the right - side riemann - liouville derivative @xmath137 , @xmath138 , is much smaller than the region of integration for the left - side derivative @xmath139 , @xmath140 , in which also the major portion of @xmath125 is located .",
    "thus , at large @xmath53 we get for the stationary state , @xmath141 equivalently , this corresponds to the approximative equality @xmath142 we are seeking asymptotic behaviours of @xmath125 in the form @xmath143 ( @xmath144 , @xmath145 .",
    "after integration of relation ( [ cond1 ] ) , we find @xmath146 the integral on the right hand side can be approximated through @xmath147 thus , we identify the powers of @xmath53 and the prefactor , with the results @xmath148 and @xmath149 by symmetry of the pdf we therefore recover the general asymptotic form @xmath150 for all @xmath134 .",
    "this result is remarkable , for various reasons :    \\(i ) despite the approximations involved , the asymptotic form ( [ as ] ) for arbitrary @xmath36 matches exactly previously obtained forms , such as the exact analytical result for the harmonic lf ( linear lvy oscillator ) , @xmath151 reported in reference @xcite ; the result for the quartic lvy oscillator with @xmath78 discussed in references @xcite ; and the case of even power - law exponents @xmath74 ( @xmath152 ) given in reference @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) the prefactor @xmath153 is independent of the potential exponent @xmath31 ; in this sense , @xmath153 is ` universal ' .",
    "\\(iii ) for each value @xmath11 of the lvy index the critical value @xmath154 exists such that at @xmath155 the variance @xmath156 is infinite , whereas at @xmath157 the variance is _",
    "finite_.    \\(iv ) we have found a fairly simple trick to construct stationary solutions at large @xmath53 in the form of inverse power series .",
    "in this section , we show results for the pdf of the fractional fokker - planck equation ( [ ffpe1 ] ) obtained via two different numerical techniques , one being the grnwald - letnikov method , which is based on an iterative solution of the deterministic dynamical equation ( [ ffpe1 ] ) by replacing the riesz fractional derivative with grnwald - letnikov operators ; the other being the langevin method , in which the langevin equation with lvy noise , equation ( [ langevin ] ) is integrated numerically .",
    "both methods lead to analogous results , and they also produce results for the pdf which are in perfect agreement with above analytical results . we present the numerical results in two subsections , devoted to the two numerical methods . these methods themselves are discussed in the appendix .        before , we have proved the existence of a bimodal stationary state for the quartic ( @xmath78 ) lvy oscillator .",
    "this bimodality emerges as a bifurcation at a critical time @xmath158 , at which the curvature at the origin vanishes .",
    "this scenario is replaced for @xmath2 , as displayed in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "thus , there obviously exist two timescales , the critical time for the emergence of the two off - centre maxima , which are characteristic for the stationary state ; and a second one , which is designated to the relaxation of the initial central hump , i.e. , the decaying initial distribution @xmath102 .",
    "the formation of the two off - centre humps while the central one is still present , is detailed in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "this existence of a transient tri - modal state was found to be typical for all @xmath2 .    in figures",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , we show additional details of the tri - modal state .",
    "thus , figure [ fig5 ] depicts a bifurcation diagram for the abovely shown process ; the initial mono - modal pdf bifurcates to a tri - modal one , before it finally turns over to bimodality . in figure",
    "[ fig6 ] , these two turnover times are displayed as function of the lvy index @xmath11 . clearly , there is always a gap between these two time scales , leaving the intermittent time for the tri - modal state , and for @xmath159 , this region shrinks , both curves converge to infinity , as in the regular gaussian case no such bifurcation exists .      above findings",
    "can be put in context with the purely bimodal case discussed earlier . a convenient way of displaying the @xmath30-modal character of the pdf in the presence of a superharmonic external potential of the type ( [ poti1 ] ) is the phase diagram shown in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "there , we summarise the findings that for @xmath160 the bifurcation occurs between the initial mono - modal and the stationary bimodal pdf at a finite critical time , whereas for @xmath2 , a transient tri - modal state exists . moreover , we also include the shaded region , in which @xmath31 is too small to ensure a finite variance .",
    "complementarily , in figure [ fig8 ] , the temporal domains of the @xmath30-modal states are graphed , and the solid lines separating these domains correspond to the critical timescales . again , the transient nature of the tri - modal state is distinct .",
    "as explained in the appendix , this method directly integrates the langevin equation for white lvy noise , the latter being portrayed in figure [ noise ] .",
    "typical results for the sample paths under the influence of an external potential ( [ poti1 ] ) with increasing superharmonicity are shown in figure [ fig9 ] in comparison to the brownian case ( i.e. , white gaussian noise ) .",
    "for increasing the external exponent @xmath31 , the long excursions , which are typical for homogeneous lfs are increasingly suppressed . in the harmonic case @xmath151 still present ( in this case , the variance is diverging ) , they are clearly confined for @xmath1 . note the comparable ordinate windows in comparison to the significantly different scale in the homogeneous case of figure [ noise ] . for all displayed cases ,",
    "however , the qualitative behaviour of the noise under the external potential is different from the brownian noise even in this case of strong confinement . in the same figure",
    ", we also show the curvature of the external potential .",
    "additional investigations have shown that the maximum curvature is always very close to the positions of the two maxima , leading us to conjecture that they are in fact identical .",
    "the latter observation is further investigated in figure [ fig10 ] . on a linear scale ,",
    "the potential well and its curvature are compared to the stationary pdf , clearly demonstrating the proximity of maximum curvature and the two maxima .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] also corroborates on the basis of the langevin method the asymptotic inverse power - law behaviour derived in equation ( [ as ] ) .",
    "finally , in figure [ fig11 ] , we display the time evolution of the pdf in the three different modality - regimes according to figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "the comparatively noisy result is due to a small number of trajectories used for the statistical average , due to the rather computation intensive program .",
    "by combining analytical and numerical results , we discussed lfs in a superharmonic external potential of power @xmath31 . depending on the magnitude of this exponent @xmath31 , different regimes could be demonstrated .",
    "thus , for @xmath151 , the character of the lvy noise imprinted on the process , is not changed by the external potential : the resulting pdf has lvy index @xmath11 , the same as the noise itself , and will thus give rise to a diverging variance at all times .",
    "conversely , for @xmath1 , the variance becomes finite if only @xmath161 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the pdf leaves the class of lvy stable pdfs and acquires an inverse power - law asymptotic behaviour with power @xmath162 .",
    "obviously , moments of higher order still diverge .",
    "apart from the finite variance , the pdf is distinguished by the observation that it bifurcates from the initial mono - modal to a stationary bimodal state .",
    "if @xmath2 , there exists a transient tri - modal state .",
    "this richness of the pdf both during relaxation and at stationarity , depending on a competition between lvy noise and steepness of the potential contrasts the universal approach to the boltzmann equilibrium , solely defined by the external potential , in classical diffusion .",
    "it may be speculated what the exact kinetic reason for the occurrence of the multiple humps is . due to the observation that the non - transient humps seem to coincide with the positions of maximum curvature of the external potential",
    ", one may conclude that the potential at these points changes almost abruptly ( especially for larger @xmath31 ) from a rather flat to a very steep slope , towards which the random walker is driven by the diffusivity .",
    "i.e. , in comparison to the harmonic and subharmonic cases , the restoring force close to the origin is comparably weak .",
    "the different regimes for @xmath1 can be classified in terms of critical quantities , in particular , the bifurcation time(s ) @xmath158 and the critical external potential exponent @xmath163 .",
    "lfs in superharmonic potentials can then be conveniently represented by phase diagrams on the @xmath164 and @xmath165 plains .",
    "the numerical solution of both the fractional fokker - planck equation in terms of the grnwald - letnikov scheme used to find a discretised approximation of the fractional riesz operator shows reliable convergence , as corroborated by direct solution of the corresponding langevin equation .",
    "our findings have underlined the statement that the properties of lfs , in particular under non - trivial boundary conditions or in an external potential are not fully understood .",
    "the general difficulty , which hampers a similarly straightforward investigation like in the regular gaussian or the subdiffusive cases , is connected with the strong spatial correlations of the problems , manifested in the integrodifferential nature of the riesz fractional operator .",
    "for this reason it is already non - trivial to determine the stationary solution of the process .",
    "we expect , by the fact that diverging fluctuations appear to be relevant in physical systems , a range of yet unknown properties of lfs remain to be discovered .",

    "this work is supported by the intas project 00 - 0847 .",
