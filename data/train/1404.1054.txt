    "the nature of dark matter ( dm ) remains an open question . at the fundamental level ,",
    "dm is expected to be described in terms of a quantum field theory . at the effective level , however , a description in terms of classical particles is usually considered , see e.g. the large literature on n - body simulations  @xcite .",
    "most current efforts are focused on detecting a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , both by direct  @xcite and indirect  @xcite searches . in the case of wimps",
    "its present - day abundance is fixed at the time when dm decoupled from the thermal plasma .",
    "if the interaction of dm lies at the weak scale , with a mass of the particle in the range of @xmath1 ( as expected from the supersymmetric extensions to the standard model ) , the energy density of these particles coincides `` miraculously '' with the observed one  @xcite .",
    "however , alternatives exist and deserve careful scrutiny , either to constrain the associated parameter space , and thus phenomenology , or to dismiss them as viable candidates .",
    "one such proposal considers that the abundance of dm is fixed by an asymmetry between the number densities of particles and antiparticles  @xcite , similarly to the baryons and leptons in the universe .",
    "if the particle interactions in the early universe are strong enough to guarantee thermal equilibrium , and dm is further composed of a spin-0 quantum field , the zero mode could have developed a bose - einstein condensate where a description in terms of a classical field would be warranted .",
    "classical coherent states can also emerge nonthermally , no asymmetry required , by means of the vacuum misalignment mechanism  @xcite .",
    "similar ideas have been considered previously in the literature under many different names , such as scalar field  @xcite , bec  @xcite , q - ball  @xcite , fuzzy  @xcite , boson  @xcite , or even fluid  @xcite , dm ; see also refs .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "a natural realization of this scenario can be provided by the axion  @xcite . originally introduced to solve the charge - parity violation problem in qcd  @xcite ,",
    "the axion was soon recognized as a promising candidate for dm . in this case",
    "the size of the condensate is so small  @xcite that , most probably , dm halos made of axion - balls could not be distinguished from the ones simulated with n - body codes by means of galactic dynamics and/or lensing observations  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that with an appropriate choice of the parameters in the model ( see the next two paragraphs for details ) , it could be possible to develop single structures with the size of a galaxy  @xcite .",
    "for practical purposes we will restrict our attention to the case of a massive , self - interacting , complex scalar field with an internal @xmath2 global symmetry satisfying the klein - gordon equation @xmath3 here the box denotes the dalembertian operator in four dimensions , with @xmath4 the mass of the scalar particle and @xmath5 a dimensionless self - interaction term . as long as the interaction between bosons is repulsive , @xmath6 , a universal mass density profile for the static , spherically symmetric , regular , asymptotically flat , self - gravitating equilibrium scalar field configurations emerges in the weak field , thomas - fermi regime  @xcite of the einstein - klein - gordon system with the following analytic form : @xmath7 in the effective description above there are two free parameters : first , the size of the gravitating objects , @xmath8}\\right)^2 \\,\\textrm{kpc}\\,,\\ ] ] a parameter that , as manifest from the equation , depends directly on the bare constants of the theory in the combination @xmath9 ; second , the value of the mass density at the center of the configuration , @xmath10 , a quantity that in principle can vary from galaxy to galaxy . here @xmath11 is the total charge in the system , that in this case coincides with the total number of particles , and for convenience we have defined the dimensionless constant @xmath12 .    the mass density profile in eq .",
    "( [ density ] ) describes only the diluted configurations of a scalar field in a regime of weak gravity ; in terms of particle numbers that translates into ( see e.g. eq .  ( 25 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath13 the inequalities in eq .",
    "( [ eq : inequalities ] ) demand @xmath14 ; that is guaranteed if the combination @xmath9 for the mass and self - interaction terms of the scalar boson is well below the planck scale .",
    "it is precisely the very large value expected for the constant @xmath15 what makes possible to blow up the compton wavelength of the scalar particle , @xmath16 , up to galactic scales , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : rmax ] ) above",
    ". only configurations with masses @xmath17 in the range from @xmath18 up to @xmath19 can be described by the expression in eq .",
    "( [ density ] ) .",
    "then , in order to have an halo model for objects of at least @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) we need a scalar dm particle with @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .        the density profile in eq .",
    "( [ density ] ) was derived under the assumption that all the dm particles are in a condensate , while in a more realistic situation probably only a fraction of them would be represented by the coherent classical state .",
    "( that seems indeed necessary in order to explain the flattened rotation curves in large spirals , where observations suggest @xmath24 at large radii . ) unfortunately , there is not yet a satisfactory description that includes this effect ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a proposal in this direction ) .",
    "nevertheless , this halo model can still be deemed appropriate to test the self - interacting scalar field dm scenario if we carefully choose observations that are sensitive only to the mass contained up to a radius smaller or comparable to @xmath25 , where the condensate is expected to dominate the distribution of dm .",
    "one should then look at the profile in eq .",
    "( [ density ] ) not necessarily as a dm halo model for the whole galaxy , but for the core of the self - gravitating object only .",
    "the dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) satellites of the milky way are probably the most promising objects to test dm models as far as structure formation is concerned .",
    "these old , pressure - supported systems are the smallest and least luminous known galaxies , and there is strong evidence that they are dm - dominated at all radii , with mass - to - light ratios as large as @xcite @xmath26_{\\odot}\\,.\\ ] ] the dynamics of these objects , for instance , could allow us to determine whether dm halos are cored or cuspy : since the concentration of baryons in these galaxies is so low , effects such as the adiabatic contraction and/or supernova feedback can not alter significantly the shape of the original halo .",
    "current data do not yet conclusively discriminate between cuspy and cored profiles  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the kinematics of the eight classical dsph satellites of the milky way to determine whether a self - interacting scalar particle in a condensate is able to reproduce the galaxies internal dynamics and , if so , under what conditions on the theory input parameters . in this respect ,",
    "our study extends previous analyses carried out for the generalized hernquist  @xcite and burkert  @xcite profiles to the dm halo model in eq .",
    "( [ density ] ) .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the purpose of this paper is not to compare the profile in eq .",
    "( [ density ] ) with other halo models in the literature , but , rather , to use dsph dynamics to test the self - consistency of the scalar field dark matter scenario .",
    "we find that the eight classical dsphs indicate a scale radius of the order @xmath27 a value in tension with previous results found using the rotation curves of low - surface - brightness ( lsb ) and dwarf galaxies  @xcite ; see also refs .",
    "@xcite for bigger galaxies .",
    "our findings strongly disfavor a _ self - interacting condensate dm halo model _ or , if one hypothesizes that the condensate describes only the core of galaxies , they indicate that the relevance of the coherent state to describe dm in larger galaxies is , at best , negligible .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies are simple , old systems composed of a dm halo and of a stellar population .",
    "rotation in these galaxies is negligible , and the stellar component is supported against gravity by its random motion . therefore the observation that can be used to test dm models is not rotation curves but , rather , the line - of - sight velocity dispersions .",

    "since the scale radius is a constant in the theory one could perform a combined analysis for the eight galaxies keeping this quantity fixed . for the purpose of this paper , however , this procedure is not warranted ; instead we estimate @xmath25 for each galaxy , and we then compare the values obtained for the different galaxies .",
    "we will also contrast our results against previous constraints arising from the study of the rotational curves of lsb and dwarf galaxies . as we show below",

    "an upper limit to the mass of these objects stems from the requirement that the dynamical friction decay time not be larger than the age of the universe  @xcite , although there are no model independent limits on the total mass of these galaxies .",
    "finally , it is also interesting to note that observations suggest a decline in the velocity dispersion profiles at large projected radii  @xcite , whereas the predicted profiles for large values of the scale radius grow at large radii .",
