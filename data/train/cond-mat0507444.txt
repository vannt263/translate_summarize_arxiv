    "the dynamics and the storage and retrieval properties of multi - state attractor neural networks have been studied over some time now and numerous results are available ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . the majority of the results obtained on the storage and retrieval properties concern sequential updating of the neurons .",
    "recently , it has been realized that synchronous updating of the spins in disordered systems can lead to different physics @xcite-@xcite .",
    "for example , for binary spins , it is known that the phase diagram of the sequential and synchronous little - hopfield neural network @xcite in the replica - symmetric approximation are different @xcite , whereas the phase diagrams of the sherrington - kirkpatrick model @xcite are the same @xcite .",
    "for the three - state ising ferromagnet the same stationary solutions appear except for negative couplings , while for the blume - emery - griffiths ferromagnet the phase diagram for synchronous updating is much richer @xcite .",
    "for the three - state ising neural network the possible different physics between sequential and synchronous updating has not yet been studied .",
    "looking at the literature we see that using sequential updating the equilibrium properties of the @xmath0-ising model for the fully connected architecture have been studied in @xcite and @xcite making a replica symmetric ansatz .",
    "the results for the extremely diluted architecture appeared in @xcite and have been extended later to the whole dilution range in @xcite .",
    "the layered architecture with variable dilution has been examined recently @xcite .",
    "nothing has been reported on the equilibrium properties for the recurrent architectures , however , when synchronous updating is used . on the other hand , concerning dynamics no calculations were done for the @xmath0-ising model with sequential updating . for synchronous updating the work of @xcite on the exactly solvable extremely diluted asymmetric little - hopfield model has been extended to the @xmath0-ising model in @xcite .",
    "later on , the dynamics for the fully connected and the extremely diluted symmetric @xmath0-ising architecture have been solved in @xcite and , respectively , @xcite .",
    "the latter studies make use of the so - called signal - to - noise analysis ( see , e.g. , @xcite for references on this method ) .",
    "an extension to the whole dilution range , in analogy with @xcite has not yet been given .",
    "the aim of this work is precisely to fill the gaps mentioned above with a report on the study of the @xmath1-ising network with synchronous updating and variable dilution and a detailed comparison of the results obtained with the ones for sequential updating .",
    "first , the thermodynamic and retrieval properties are examined using replica symmetric mean - field theory .",
    "capacity - temperature phase diagrams are derived for several values of the pattern activity and different gradations of dilution . apart from the appearance of cycles",
    "the asymptotic behaviour is almost identical to the one for sequential updating .",
    "the spin - glass region is visibly enhanced , while the retrieval region , however , is only marginally enhanced .",
    "only the addition of self - couplings can enlarge the retrieval region substantially , especially in the case of strong dilution .",
    "a calculaton of the information content shows that both for synchronous and sequential updating the three - state networks are robust against the interference of static noise coming from random dilution .",
    "next , the dynamics of the model is studied using the generating function technique @xcite . as an illustration",
    "some typical flow diagrams for the overlap order parameter are presented .",
    "it is possible to extract the result for sequential updating from the one for synchronous updating . as in the hopfield model",
    "@xcite one can argue that the signal - to - noise analysis used before in the literature is a short memory approximation correct up to the third time step . and",

    "the phase diagrams and retrieval properties are discussed for arbitrary temperatures as a function of the gain parameter , the amount of dilution and the strength of the self - coupling .",

    "since this method is really standard by now , at least for sequential updating , we refrain from giving any detailed calculations but concentrate on the main results and the differences between sequential and synchronous updating . indeed , some complications arise due to the symmetry between the two types of spins in the hamiltonian .    starting from the replicated partition function , performing the dilution average and the average over the condensed ( @xmath37 ) and non - condensed ( @xmath38 ) patterns we obtain for the replicated free energy density @xmath39 with @xmath40 the symbol",

    "we remark that the corresponding result for sequential dynamics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) is recovered by assuming @xmath50 and rescaling the temperature with a factor 2 .",
    "furthermore , we notice that compared with sequential updating , the replicated free energy ( [ eq : qisingp : fe_n ] ) is more involved .",
    "it is clear that a priori the matrices appearing in this expression are not necessarily symmetric .",

    "one notices that the results for sequential and synchronous updating ( without self - coupling ) are almost coincident . in all cases ,",
    "we find that the quality of the retrieval properties is affected very little , unless the amount of dilution is high .",

    "recently , by a comparison with the generating functional analysis ( gfa ) , it has been found @xcite for the hopfield model that the application of this method in the study of the dynamics involves a short - memory approximation implying that the results are only exact up to the third time step , although they stay very accurate in the retrieval region for further time steps , but not so in the spin - glass region .",
    "it has also been shown that the signal - to - noise analysis can be made exact , leading to the same results as the generating functional analysis .    therefore , it is interesting to reconsider the dynamics for the @xmath1-state ising model using this generating functional technique , which was introduced in @xcite to the field of statistical mechanics and , by now , is part of many textbooks .",

    "we have studied the statics and dynamics of the three - state ising neural network model with synchronous updating of the neurons and variable dilution .",
    "we have followed as closely as possible the discussion for the hopfield model adapting the methods to the multi - state nature of the neurons .",
    "although the equations that describe both statics and dynamics are formally rather similar to those of the hopfield model , we have seen that the physics behind it is quite different .",
    "we have examined the thermodynamic and retrieval properties for this model using replica symmetric mean - field theory and have made a detailed comparison of the results with those for sequential updating .",
    "capacity - temperature phase diagrams are derived for several values of the pattern activity and different gradations of dilution .",
    "apart from the appearance of cycles the asymptotic behaviour is almost identical to the one for sequential updating .",
    "the spin - glass region is visibly enhanced , while the retrieval region , however , is only marginally enhanced .",
    "only the addition of self - couplings can enlarge the retrieval region substantially , especially in the case of strong dilution .",
    "a calculation of the information content shows that both for synchronous and sequential updating the three - state networks are robust against the interference of static noise coming from random dilution .",
    "concerning the dynamics , we have extended the generating functional analysis to the study of @xmath0-state spins . as an illustration",
    "some typical flow diagrams for the overlap order parameter are presented in the case @xmath1 .",
    "it is possible to extract the result for sequential updating from the one for synchronous updating .",
