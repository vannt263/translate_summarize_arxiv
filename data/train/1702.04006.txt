    "blazars are the most powerful active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with relativistic jets oriented close to the line of sight .",
    "the jet radiation dominates their broadband emission , especially at @xmath1-rays where the inverse compton ( ic ) hump of the blazar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) peaks around tens or hundreds of mev . the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard the _ fermi _  satellite @xcite has already detected thousands of blazars , thus confirming that they are the most numerous population in the @xmath1-ray sky ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . nonetheless , high - redshift blazars above a redshift of 3.1 are missing in the _ fermi _  catalogs , possibly due to the shift of the ic peak to lower frequencies in which lat is less sensitive . the newly released pass 8 photon data set @xcite , with an improved event - level analysis ,",
    "substantially enhances the sensitivity of the lat at all energies and in particular at lower energies ( i.e. , @xmath8200mev ) .",
    "this increases the capability of the lat to detect spectrally soft , potentially high-@xmath9 blazars .",
    "these objects typically have large bolometric luminosities ( @xmath1010@xmath11erg s@xmath12 ) and host powerful relativistic jets ( @xmath13 for a given accretion efficiency ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in general",
    ", they harbor extremely massive black holes ( @xmath14 ; * ? ? ?",
    "since blazars are highly beamed , the detection of a single blazar implies the existence of @xmath15 ( i.e. , @xmath16400@xmath17600 , @xmath18 is the bulk lorentz factor ) misaligned blazars with similar properties .",
    "therefore , the detection of high-@xmath9 blazars can constrain models of supermassive black hole formation in the early universe ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that the detection of new high-@xmath9 blazars will test the hypotheses of blazar evolution , since these high redshifts constrain the time available for such extreme objects to grow .",
    "motivated by the recent release of the sensitive pass  8 dataset , we perform a systematic search for new @xmath1-ray emitters beyond @xmath2 and in this letter we report the first detection of five @xmath19 @xmath1-ray emitting blazars . throughout",
    ", we adopt a @xmath20cdm cosmology with the hubble constant @xmath21  km  s@xmath12  mpc@xmath12 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "in order to search for high-@xmath9 blazars , we start from the @xmath161.4million quasars included in the million quasar catalog ( mqc ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we select all @xmath19 sources and retain only radio - loud ( rl ) quasars with @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the ratio of the rest - frame 5 ghz ( extrapolated from 1.4 ghz , considering a flat radio spectrum ) to optical @xmath26 band flux density @xcite , assuming an optical spectral index @xmath170.5 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "these 1103 objects represent our parent sample and we analyze lat data for all of them according to the following procedure .",
    "for each object we use @xmath1692 months ( from 2008 august 5 to 2016 april 1 ) of _ fermi _  pass  8 source class photons and analyze them following the standard data reduction procedure , but with a few modifications as mentioned below .",
    "we define a region of interest ( roi ) of 15@xmath28 radius centered on each quasar and define a sky model that includes all @xmath1-ray sources detected in the third _ fermi_-lat catalog ( 3fgl ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , within the roi and the isotropic and galactic diffuse emission models @xcite .",
    "the parameters of all sources within the roi and power - law normalization factors of the diffuse models are optimized so that the sky model reproduces the data as best as possible .",
    "this is done via a binned likelihood method and we measure the significance of the detection by means of the maximum likelihood test statistic ts= 2@xmath29 , where @xmath30 represents the likelihood function , between models with and without a point source at the position of the quasar . the targets of interest are modeled with a simple power - law model leaving the prefactor and the photon index free to vary during the likelihood fitting .",
    "we consider a source to be significantly detected if ts@xmath31 ( 4.2@xmath32 ; * ? ? ?",
    "since we are dealing with faint sources , we modify the standard data reduction procedure as follows .",
    "we expand the energy range considered so it spans 60 mev to 300 gev .",
    "this allows the analysis to be more sensitive to spectrally soft @xmath1-ray sources , i.e. , blazars whose high - energy peak is shifted to lower energies ( @xmath161@xmath1710mev ) as typical for high-@xmath9 blazars .",
    "moreover , pass  8 provides an increase in the acceptance at @xmath8100mev by up to 75% , with respect to pass 7 , which translates into an improved sensitivity for high-@xmath9 blazars .",
    "because the energy resolution becomes increasingly worse at low energies we enable the energy dispersion correction in the analysis for all sources except the empirical diffuse models .",
    "a novelty introduced by pass  8 is the characterization of the photons in psf ( point - spread function ) type events , which sub - classify the events into four quartiles by quality of angular reconstruction , with the lowest quartile ( psf0 ) and highest quartile ( psf3 ) having the worst and the best , respectively , direction reconstruction . in order to take full advantage of this improvement",
    ", we perform a component - wise data analysis for each psf event type by considering the product of the likelihood function ( sum of the logarithms ) for the four psf event types , using the summed likelihood method of the science tools .    as in the case of our target sources",
    ", there could be faint gamma - ray emitters present in the data but not in the 3fgl catalog .",
    "thus , we rely on an iterative procedure to discover , localize , and insert such sources into the sky model .",
    "this is done by generating a residual ts map for each roi .",
    "the spatial positions of unmodeled excesses with ts@xmath3325 are optimized and inserted into the sky model with power - law spectra .",
    "this procedure is iterated until no significant unmodeled emission remains in the roi .",
    "our systematic search for significant @xmath1-ray emitters among a large sample of rl quasars has led to the detection of five sources . a likelihood ratio ( lr )",
    "method ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) associates the detected @xmath1-ray sources and their radio counterparts ( from nrao vla sky survey or nvss ; * ? ? ?",

    "] , we found that the probability that any of the newly detected @xmath1-ray sources are spurious is negligible .",
    "the basic information for these objects is presented in table [ tab : basic_info ] where we also show the results of the lat data analysis . as can be seen ,",
    "all the objects are extremely rl and @xmath1-ray luminous quasars . according to our analysis , _",

    ", high - redshift blazars are brighter at hard x - rays than in the @xmath1-ray band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , probably due to the shift of the blazar sed to lower frequencies .",
    "this could be due to the intrinsic shift of the high - energy peak to lower energies as the bolometric non - thermal luminosity increases .",
    "another possible reason for the shift could be the fact that the high - energy emission of such high - redshift blazars is powered via ic scattering off photons from the torus rather than the broad - line region ( blr ) , which also contributes to the lowering of the frequency of their sed peak @xcite . alternatively , the sed peaks can also shift to lower energies provided the emission region is within the dense blr photon field . in this case",
    ", an efficient cooling of the emitting electrons will cause the lowering of the sed peaks @xcite .",
    "the shift of the sed causes their @xmath1-ray spectra to become steeper and to move slightly outside , or at the limit , of the _ fermi_-lat band .",
    "indeed , all the blazars discovered here exhibit steep @xmath1-ray spectra ( @xmath36 , see table [ tab : basic_info ] ) .",
    "this suggests their ic peak lie at mev energies .    in figure [ fig:3lac ] ,",
    "we compare these newly detected distant objects with the blazars included in the third catalog of _",
    "fermi_-lat detected agn ( 3lac ; * ? ? ?",
    "as can be seen in the left panel , these sources occupy the region of high @xmath1-ray luminosities ( @xmath37 ergs@xmath12 ) and soft photon indices ( @xmath38 ) , typical of powerful blazars . the right panel of figure [ fig:3lac ] compares the redshift distributions of these newly discovered high-@xmath9 blazars with that of the 3lac blazars .",
    "though the population of distant blazars is small , this work opens a window for the study of high-@xmath9 blazars and may have a major impact on constraining the various physical parameters associated with the blazar population ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a relevant discussion ) .    in order to understand the broadband behavior of these high-@xmath9 blazars we look into the literature for multi - frequency information . though there is a paucity of such data , we found a few noteworthy observations that support the blazar nature of these objects .",
    "nvss j064632 + 445116 was predicted as a candidate @xmath1-ray emitter by @xcite , whereas nvss j135406@xmath17020603 is included in the roma - bzcat .",
    "the quasar nvss j212912@xmath17153841 is a hard x - ray spectrum luminous blazar and included in the 70 month _",
    "swift_-burst alert telescope catalog @xcite .",
    "nvss j151002 + 570243 is one of the best studied among all of the objects and exhibits an intense and hard x - ray spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we generate broadband seds of the three objects that have archival x - ray observations and model them using a simple one zone synchrotron - ic emission approach prescribed in @xcite . in brief",
    ", the model assumes a spherical emission region located at a distance @xmath39 from the central engine and filled with a population of highly energetic electrons that follow a broken power - law distribution . in the presence of a tangled magnetic field ,",
    "the electrons lose energy via synchrotron , synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) , and external compton ( ec ) processes . for the latter ,",
    "the seed photons originate from several external agn components : photons directly emitted from the accretion disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , from blr @xcite and from the infrared torus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the calculated jet powers and sed parameters are given in table [ tab : sed_par ] and the modeled seds are shown in figure [ fig : sed ] .    in each of the three objects ,",
    "the ir - uv emission is found to be dominated by an extremely luminous accretion disk ( @xmath40 ergs@xmath12 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectra , on the other hand , are hard and the entire x - ray to @xmath1-ray band of the sed can be explained by the ic scattering off the photons originating from the blr .",
    "a strong accretion disk radiation implies a dense blr photon field surrounding the jet , which in turn is observable in the form of broad optical emission lines . according to our sed modeling analysis , a large blr",
    "radiative energy density indicates that most of the high - energy emission originates from the interaction of the blr photons with the jet electrons .",
    "this suggests that the cooling of the electrons will be efficient , and accordingly the synchrotron emission will peak at low frequencies , which is supported by the modeling results .",
    "this indicates the location of the @xmath1-ray emitting region to be inside the blr .",
    "however , it should be noted that with the sparse available observations , it is not possible to tightly constrain the location of the emission region .",
    "the compton dominance ( ratio of the ic to synchrotron peak luminosities ) of each of the three sources is also very large ( @xmath4 , table [ tab : sed_par ] ) , a characteristic feature exhibited by powerful blazars .",
    "other sed parameters are similar to those generally observed in high-@xmath9 blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . though the data used here are mostly non - simultaneous , they indicate a _",
    "typical _ state of the blazar rather than any period of specific activity . also , the @xmath1-ray photon statistics are not good enough to search for temporal variability .",
    "overall , the _ fermi_-lat detection and the available data confirm the blazar nature of the 5 high-@xmath9 rl quasars .",
    "powerful blazars are generally found to host massive black holes at their centers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is , therefore , of great interest to determine the black hole mass of these @xmath1-ray detected quasars . in table",
    "[ tab : basic_info ] , we report the black hole masses for each of the five sources using information that we could find / derive from the optical spectroscopic information available in the literature @xcite . furthermore",
    ", we also derive the masses by modeling the observed ir - uv emission for three objects ( figure [ fig : sed ] ) with a standard accretion disk and the results are presented in table [ tab : sed_par ] .",
    "both methods predict the existence of massive black holes ( @xmath41 ) and match reasonably well within a factor of @xmath16three0.4 dex ) associated with the virial bh mass estimation methods ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ", except for nvss j151002 + 570243 , for which the modeling approach predicts a higher black hole mass .",
    "in particular , the object nvss j212912@xmath17153841 hosts one of the most massive black holes , @xmath167",
    "@xmath42 m@xmath43 , ever found in @xmath1-ray emitting blazars , confirmed both from optical spectroscopic and disk modeling approaches .    at redshifts between 3 and 4 ,",
    "the space density of black holes with @xmath44 hosted in jetted agn is  50gpc@xmath45 @xcite .",
    "this estimate is based on the luminosity function reported in @xcite , which , at those redshifts , relies only on five blazars .",
    "this work finds two more blazars hosting massive black holes ( @xmath46@xmath47 ) in the same redshift range , considering black hole masses derived from the optical spectroscopic information .",
    "adopting @xmath48 , derived from our sed modeling , these two objects imply the presence of @xmath16675 ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) similar systems , but with jets pointing in all directions , in the same redshift bin .",
    "the number density related to these two sources can be computed as @xmath50 gpc@xmath45 , where @xmath51=0.52 is the fraction of the sky covered by our parent sample , @xmath52=0.84 is the fraction of sources in the parent sample with a spectroscopic redshift , @xmath53=0.66 is the fraction of @xmath1-ray sources that are associated and @xmath54gpc@xmath45 is the available volume where these sources could have been detected @xcite .",
    "this brings the estimate of the space density of massive black holes hosted in jetted systems to 68@xmath55gpc@xmath45 . already at redshift 4",
    ", this implies that there is a similar number of massive black holes hosted in radio - loud and radio - quiet systems and that , given their strong evolution , above that redshift most massive black holes might be hosted in radio - loud systems @xcite .",
    "this clearly shows that the radio - loud phase may be a key ingredient for quick black hole growth in the early universe . to this end",
    ", the detection of high-@xmath9 blazars becomes very important .",
    "currently , the most promising approaches are , ( 1 ) lowering the energy threshold of the lat , and ( 2 ) using _",
    "nustar_. however , the optimal instrument would be a sensitive all - sky mev telescope , e.g. , e - astrogam @xcite and amego .",
