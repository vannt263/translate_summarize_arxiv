    "of particular interest is the case where @xmath170 grows like a constant proportion of @xmath15 , as in recent work by wadayama @xcite .",
    "note that the counting bound now gives a lower bound of @xmath171 , while , for coupon - collector reasons , the iid random approach here inevitably leads to the suboptimal @xmath172 .",
    "we now show the full result of lemma [ hardlem ] .",
    "we use the same random construction as the special case described in section [ secproof ] , but now take @xmath173 , so @xmath174 , where @xmath81 is a parameter to be chosen later ( simply taking @xmath76 as in section [ secproof ] gives @xmath175 ) . within the group testing literature , different values of @xmath85 have also been considered . for example , the value @xmath176 ( which gives an average of one defective per test ) has been considered before by many authors @xcite , while sejdinovic and johnson @xcite consider the more general @xmath177 for noisy group testing .",

    "now , @xmath193 when @xmath194 or , since @xmath174 , @xmath195 then , in light of the above , we will split between the three cases : first , @xmath196 ; second , @xmath197 ; and third , @xmath198 .",
    "for the first case , @xmath196 , the maximum of is attained at @xmath199 , giving the bound @xmath200 summing over this range for @xmath94 yields @xmath201 provided that @xmath202 for some @xmath125 , then this can be made arbitrarily small for @xmath15 sufficiently large .",
    "for the second case , @xmath197 , the maximum is attained at @xmath192 , giving the bound @xmath203 then we have that @xmath204 where we called @xmath205 , and we have used that @xmath206 .",
