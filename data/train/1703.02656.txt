    "exoplanet research is moving beyond an era dominated by discovery and statistics and into one in which characterization of planets and their atmospheres takes a leading role .",
    "pioneering surveys by ground - based telescopes using the doppler radial velocity ( rv ) method @xcite , and the corot satellite using the transit photometry method @xcite segued to the _ kepler _ mission and its transit survey of almost 200,000 stars @xcite .",
    "the yield of thousands of candidate or confirmed exoplanets has enabled statistical descriptions of the planet population down to earth - size or smaller .    however , the information provided by a transiting exoplanet mission like _ kepler _ and its successor _ k2 _ is limited to the orbital period and radius of the planet , assuming the radius of the star is known .",
    "this is true of any  white light \" measurement where only the signal integrated over the full wavelength range of the instrument response is recorded . to validate and characterize transit detections ,",
    "additional data obtained from the ground or space are usually needed .",
    "future space - based exoplanet surveys , i.e. the transiting exoplanet survey satellite ( _ tess _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the planetary transits and oscillations ( _ plato _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will target brighter stars suitable for such follow - up over much of the sky .",
    "in addition to rv observations to measure planet mass , spectral ( wavelength - dependent ) information is valuable or crucial in at least three other aspects : validation of the planet and confirmation of its host star , distinguishing between reflected and emitted light from the planet as observed during opposition and secondary eclipse , and detection of any atmosphere in transmitted light during a primary transit .",
    "validation of the transiting object as a planet and identification of the correct host star often requires other observations , sometimes at multiple wavelengths . to cover large areas of sky , transit surveys use large pixel sizes ( 21  for _ tess _ ) , meaning a non - negligible probability that background stars or stellar companions contribute to the flux in the photometric aperture of a target .",
    "the additional sources dilute the transit signal , meaning that the transiting object is actually larger than apparent .",
    "in addition , a fainter , blended star rather than the target star may be the source of the signal .",
    "blended eclipsing binaries with a large contrast ratio or at much greater distances than the target star can produce `` false positives '' that mimic some aspects of a planetary transit signal .",
    "these scenarios have motivated a variety of methods to identify false positives , including analysis of the transit photometry itself @xcite , and high - resolution imaging of the host star to identify other blended sources in the transit survey ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another approach is to measure the transit depth at different wavelengths ; if the host star has a different color than other stars that contribute to the photometric flux then the transit depth will vary with wavelength @xcite .",
    "for example , the transit will be deeper at longer wavelengths if the actual source of the signal is redder than the target star .",
    "additional observations are invariably required to obtain planet properties other than radius and orbital period ; foremost among these are planet mass , which can be measured by rv measurements or the method of transit timing variation @xcite , and presence and composition of any atmosphere .",
    "estimation of both mass and radius allows a planet to be placed on a mass - radius diagram and compared to interior models .",
    "these comparisons can , for example , identify planets that are almost exclusively rocky - metal , with no or only a thin atmosphere , as well as planets with much lower densities that can be explained only by a thick envelope of hydrogen and helium which are incondensible and have a low molecular weight . in intermediate regions of the mass - radius diagram",
    "the models are degenerate , i.e. there are multiple possible bulk compositions , and mass and radius alone are not sufficient @xcite .",
    "in these cases , identification of a h - he envelope by independent means is valuable .",
    "information on any atmosphere is also crucial to understanding the formation , chemistry , surface conditions , and potential habitability of a planet .",
    "one approach to detecting and characterizing the atmosphere of an exoplanet is by observations at multiple wavelengths when either the planet passes in front of the host star ( primary transit ) , or when the star occults the planet ( secondary eclipse ) @xcite . in the former case , variation in the absorption of the atmosphere due to atomic or molecular lines or scattering cause small changes in the apparent radius of the planet with wavelength . in the latter ,",
    "the atmosphere manifests itself by reflection and emission and hence changes in the secondary eclipse depth that are wavelength - dependent .",
    "the primary _ tess _ mission will survey most of the sky and is expected to detect @xmath4 planets @xcite around relatively bright stars suitable for such follow - up .",
    "these observations can be performed by ground - based telescopes but variable atmospheric absorption and the finite duration of continuous observations limit accuracy and completeness .",
    "ground - based spectroscopy on the future generation of extremely large telescopes ( elts ) hold promise for exoplanet characterization , but the time available will greatly limit the task of screening thousands of planets .",
    "highly accurate spectrophotometric observations can be performed above the atmosphere by the _",
    "hubble _ space telescope ( _ hst _ ) or the future _ james webb space telescope _",
    "( _ jwst _ ) , but these are even more heavily competed for .",
    "what are needed are means to cheaply and rapidly screen most or all _ tess_-detected planets to identify those objects of particularly interest , e.g. those most likely to have a detectable atmospheric signal .    at the time of writing , no space satellite other than _ hst _ offers spectroscopy or multi pass - band photometry from space . in the absence of such observations ,",
    "limited spectral information can be still be extracted if the pass - bands of two measurements are substantially different , i.e. if one is redder or bluer than the other .",
    "in particular , the deep - depleted charge - coupled detectors ( ccds ) to be used in the cameras of the transiting exoplanet survey satellite ( _ tess _ ) have substantial response at @xmath5 m and beyond @xcite .",
    "this red response distinguishes them from the conventional ccds used in other cameras , i.e. that of the the nasa _ kepler _ satellite @xcite and the upcoming characterizing exoplanet satellite ( _ cheops _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and _ plato _ missions , which have declining sensitivity beyond @xmath6 m and virtually no response beyond 0.9 - 1 @xmath1 m .",
    "figure [ fig.bandpass ] show the relative response functions of the _ kepler _ , _ cheops _ , and _ tess _ ( that of _ plato _ is not yet available ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrated how the combination of photometry from _ kepler _ and _ tess _ can distinguish between the contributions of reflected light and thermal emission to the total signal from a `` hot '' jupiter - size planet on a close - in orbit . while _ kepler",
    "_ photometry is more sensitive to bluer wavelengths and thus the reflected signal , _ tess _ is more sensitive to redder wavelengths and the thermal emission from the hot day - side of the planet . by observing the depth of the secondary eclipse with both instruments , and making assumptions about the reflected and thermal spectra",
    ", the two signals can be separated , allowing both the geometric albedo and the day - side temperature to be independently estimated .",
    "the drawback of this strategy is that the primary _ kepler _ mission observed only 0.28% of the sky , and the successor k2 mission is restricted to fields near the plane of the ecliptic , which _ tess _ will not observe .",
