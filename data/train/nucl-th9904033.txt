    "the reduction of the absorption strength of high energy real photons on nuclei is known as shadowing effect .",
    "this effect is generally described considering the real photon as a superposition of a bare photon and of a hadronic fluctuation with the same quantum numbers @xmath1 . within this model",
    "the shadowing is produced by the coherent multiple scattering of the hadronic intermediate state on different nucleons inside the nucleus .",
    "the amount of the shadowing mainly depends on macroscopic nuclear parameters like the mass number a and the radius @xmath2 , and on properties of the hadronic fluctuation like the coherence length @xmath3 and the interaction cross section @xmath4 with the nucleon .    in earliest simple models @xcite , the hadronic component of the photon is given by the low - lying vector mesons @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "these vector meson dominance ( vmd ) models qualitatively reproduce the photonuclear absorption cross section behavior in the several gev domain @xcite .",
    "generalized vector meson dominance ( gvmd ) models @xcite , which include higher mass vector mesons and non diagonal terms , better explain higher energy real photon absorption and virtual photon absorption in deep inelastic electron scattering .    on the contrary , at low real photon energies",
    "most of the calculations fail to reproduce the experimental results @xcite .",
    "two recent vmd calculations , that describe the vector - meson mass distributions with @xmath7-functions @xcite and consider an energy independent vector - meson nucleon cross section @xmath8 @xcite , do not predict the nuclear damping of the photoabsorption strength observed below 2 gev , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the carbon case .",
    "in addition they also underestimate the experimental shadowing effect between 2 and 3 gev .",
    "the result of a gvmd calculation @xcite , in which the energy behavior of @xmath8 cross section is taken into account , is also given in fig .",
    "it clearly shows a better agreement with the experimental shadowing ratio , but it is not able to reproduce the absolute value of the total photonuclear cross section .",
    "the shadowing phenomena , also observed in deep inelastic lepton nucleus scattering , is also studied within a vmd model in which the photon hadronic spectral function is derived from the empirical cross sections of the _ @xmath9 hadrons _ processes @xcite .",
    "besides the vector meson mass spectra , this model also includes the low energy @xmath10 non - resonant production , and the high energy quark - antiquark continuum .    the importance of the hadronic spectral function in the description of the process is shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] where the coherence length @xmath11 of vector mesons of lower mass @xmath12 are given as a function of the photon energy @xmath13 .",
    "the shadowing effect starts to manifest at an energy for which @xmath14 is bigger than the typical intranucleon distance ( @xmath15 fm ) so that scattering on at least two nucleons is possible .",
    "then the strength of the effect starts to saturate at an energy for which @xmath14 is bigger than the nuclear size ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "clearly a low energy shadowing can be only induced by the lowest mass hadronic components of the photon spectral function and by their possible modifications in the nuclear medium .",
    "both the reduction of the vector - meson mass @xcite and the modification of the @xmath0-meson spectral function @xcite can decrease the photon energy at which the coherence length starts to exceed the intranucleon distance thus producing an earlier onset of the shadowing effect .    in this paper",
    "a model is derived to describe the photonucleon and the photonuclear total absorption cross sections above the nucleon resonance region ( @xmath17 1.65 gev ) .",
    "in particular the experimental hadronic spectral function , vector - meson nucleon cross sections and effective @xmath0-coupling constant are taken into account . a possible modification of the hadronic spectral function inside the nuclear medium is also considered .",
    "in the description of the photohadronic absorption process , the physical photon is considered as a superposition of a bare photon and a hadronic component made up of a quark - antiquark state ( @xmath18 ) .",

    "the hadronic components of the absorbed photon are mainly formed by strongly correlated @xmath18 pairs , while at higher energy @xmath18 pairs from the so - called continuum are also important .      the hadronic contribution to the photoabsorption cross section on the proton",

    "<S> a model based on the hadronic fluctuations of the real photon is developed to describe the total photonucleon and photonuclear cross sections in the energy region above the nucleon resonances . </S>",
    "<S> the hadronic spectral function of the photon is derived including the finite width of vector - meson resonances and the quark - antiquark continuum . </S>",
    "<S> the shadowing effect is evaluated considering the effective interaction of the hadronic component with the bound nucleons within a glauber - gribov multiple scattering theory . </S>",
    "<S> the low energy onset of the shadowing effect is interpreted as a possible signature of a modification of the hadronic spectral function in the nuclear medium . </S>",
    "<S> a decrease of the @xmath0-meson mass in nuclei is suggested for a better explanation of the experimental data .    </S>",
