    "the area of quantum gravity has not yet converged into a single theory and at present several rival theories co - exist .",
    "nevertheless , certain common or global features like noncommutativity at lengths less than @xmath0 @xcite , a new uncertainty principle including gravity effects @xcite , the avoidance of physical singularities @xcite ( e.g. replaced in the noncommutative geometry by a desitter core ) , black hole remnants @xcite etc . are expected .",
    "the noncommutative aspect of spacetime has been recently applied to the final state of a black hole @xcite .",
    "the starting point of these new developments is the commutation relation @xmath1=\\theta^{\\mu \\nu}$ ] .",
    "based on such a commutation relation one can show that one of the effect of non commutativity is to replace point - like objects by de - localized matter sources which turn to be of gaussian form .",
    "following @xcite we can take , instead of the point mass @xmath2 , described by a @xmath3-function distribution , a static , spherically symmetric , gaussian - smeared matter source @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the dimension of the underlying manifold .",
    "this observation gave rise to new models of mini black holes @xcite where the singularity at the origin is replaced by a self - gravitating droplet .",
    "although the issue of smearing point - like structures might not be the only fingerprint of the noncommutative geometry , these models explicitly reveal its importance .",
    "for instance , the central singularity is replaced by a desitter core ( droplet ) and the metric can have two horizons depending whether the black hole mass exceeds a certain critical mass @xcite . in schwarzschild coordinates , these horizons leave unphysical singularities in the metric components .",
    "we will present a coordinates extension in the following sections of the paper .",
    "it is therefore of some importance to find a maximal atlas for this metric and its interpretation .",
    "for any metric in general relativity with apparent unphysical singularities there is a continued interest in finding maximal singularity - free extensions @xcite .",
    "such maximal atlases often shed new light on the manifold under consideration . in particular ,",
    "this is true for metrics which are partly motivated by a quantum mechanical property such as the noncommutativity of the coordinate operators .",
    "new phenomena closely related to this quantum nature of spacetime can emerge .",
    "indeed , for the metric inspired by noncommutative geometry which we study in the present paper , the maximal atlas reveals the existence of black hole tunnels connecting parallel universes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we will discuss the singularities of the metric which emerge in the framework of noncommutative geometry when a point - like structure is smeared by the so - called gaussian prescription .",
    "section iii treats the new transformation of the schwarzschild coordinates which leads to the maximal atlas .",
    "section iv continues these considerations and discusses the determination of the constants in the transformation .",
    "section v interprets the results in terms of a penrose diagram .",
    "section vi is devoted to the extreme case where the mass is equal to a critical mass . in section vii",
    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "the replacement of the sharp point - like structure discussed above suggests that the metric can be based on the gaussian mass distribution , @xmath6 the ansatz of an anisotropic perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor taken together with two equations of state in which the pressure is determined by the tolman - oppenheimer- volkov equation leads to the noncommutative geometry inspired schwarzschild solution @xcite given by @xmath7 where @xmath2 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath8 is a parameter encoding noncommutativity and @xmath9 is the incomplete lower gamma function .",
    "the singularities of the metric are determined by the equation @xmath10 according to @xcite there are three possible scenarios , namely    1 .",
    "if @xmath11 , the function @xmath12 never vanishes , 2 .   if @xmath13 , @xmath12 vanishes just at one value @xmath14 ( extremal black hole ) , 3 .",
    "if @xmath15 , there exist @xmath16 with @xmath17 such that @xmath18    a striking feature of the metric ( [ ncss ] ) is the absence of a true singularity at @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , the above classification is of numerical nature since the equation @xmath20 can not be solved in closed form .",
    "we prove below that in the case that the black hole mass exceeds the critical mass @xmath21 the roots of the equation @xmath20 are simple .",
    "this result will play an important role in the following considerations .",
    "first we need to clarify the nature of the critical mass @xmath21 , which turns out to be the minimal mass to have horizons . therefore ,",
    "if we employ the horizon equation to define a function @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a solution of the equation @xmath20 , we obtain @xmath24 thus , having considered the derivative @xmath25 , we can look for @xmath26 such that the latter vanishes , i.e. @xmath27 .",
    "we do this in order to define @xmath28 .",
    "one can easily show that the above derivative vanishes if and only if @xmath29 from the properties of the gamma function one can easily derive the following result @xmath30 and as a consequence @xmath31 where @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "( [ extreme ] ) can now be written as @xmath33 which admits a unique solution if and only if @xmath34 .",
    "we can conclude that there exists a unique horizon radius @xmath26 , corresponding to the critical mass @xmath21 . with this in mind we can establish the following lemma    [ lemma1 ]",
    "let @xmath15 and @xmath17 such that @xmath35 .",
    "then , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are simple zeroes of ( [ zeroes ] ) .",
    "we give the proof for a generic solution @xmath38 of the horizon equation @xmath39 .",
    "therefore @xmath23 corresponds either to @xmath40 or @xmath41 . notice that if the limit @xmath42 is finite , then @xmath38 is a simple root .",
    "since @xmath12 is differentiable on the interval @xmath43 we can expand it in a taylor series and we obtain @xmath44.\\ ] ] hence , @xmath45 and in order to show that @xmath38 is a simple zero we need to prove that @xmath46 .",
    "taking into account the fact that @xmath47\\ ] ] where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to the horizon radius and comparing the above equation with the eq .",
    "( [ extreme ] ) , we can see that @xmath48 vanishes if and only if @xmath49 .",
    "this implies that @xmath13 which is at variance with the initial assumption . as a result",
    "we can conclude that @xmath50 for @xmath15 and @xmath51 .",
    "we show that the singularities of ( [ ncss ] ) can be removed by a suitable coordinate transformation as in the case of the reissner - nordstrm solution . in order to do that we shall follow @xcite . like in the kruskal approach",
    "@xcite we introduce coordinates @xmath52 and @xmath53 such that the original metric goes over to @xmath54 with the requirement that @xmath55 .",
    "this will happen if @xmath56 and @xmath57 satisfy the non homogeneous system of first order nonlinear partial differential equations @xmath58=g_{00}(r),\\label{tre}\\\\ & & f^2(u , v)\\left[(\\partial_r v)^2-(\\partial_r u)^2\\right]=-g_{00}^{-1}(r),\\label{quattro}\\\\ & & \\partial_r u~\\partial_t u-\\partial_r v~\\partial_t v=0 . \\label{cinque}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the next step is to find a suitable transformation of the variable @xmath59 such that the above system becomes a homogeneous system of pdes .",
    "if we multiply ( [ quattro ] ) by @xmath60 and we introduce a new spatial variable @xmath61 defined through @xmath62 then we have @xmath63 with @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 where @xmath59 is a function of @xmath67 .",
    "we want to show that @xmath56 and @xmath57 satisfy a wave equation .",
    "if we consider the combinations ( [ kru_4])@xmath68([kru_5])@xmath69([kru_6 ] ) we arrive at the following equations @xmath70 while taking the square roots of the above equations only those choices of the sign are allowed for which the determinant of the jacobian of the transformation @xmath71 does not vanish identically .",
    "hence , we require @xmath72 clearly , there are four possible choices of the sign .",
    "if we consider for example the case @xmath73 we would obtain @xmath74 which implies @xmath75 .",
    "the same happens if we consider @xmath76 on the other hand the choice @xmath77 leads to the equations @xmath78 we require that @xmath79 in that part of the manifold which is described by the coordinates @xmath80 . in the next section we will show that the above condition is indeed satisfied .",
    "finally , it is not difficult to verify that the choice @xmath81 is equivalent to the previous one in the sense that both give rise to the same wave equations .",
    "thus , from ( [ pre_wave ] ) we can derive the following wave equations : @xmath82 with the solutions @xmath83 substituting ( [ sol_wave ] ) into ( [ kru_4 ] ) or ( [ kru_5 ] ) gives @xmath84 with @xmath85 , @xmath86 whereas ( [ kru_6 ] ) gives a trivial identity .",
    "note that ( [ condition ] ) fixes the relative signs of the functions @xmath87 and @xmath88 since by definition of the function @xmath89 we have @xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 for @xmath93 . moreover , if we substitute ( [ sol_wave ] ) into ( [ kru_10 ] ) the invertibility condition simplifies to the requirement @xmath94 clearly , ( [ kru_11 ] ) is not satisfied for @xmath95 .",
    "this means that on the spheres with radius @xmath96 the transformations from spherical coordinates to ones which we are constructing , are not invertible .",
    "however , this is not really a problem since our goal is to construct several charts patching different regions of the manifold and by construction we will see that the transfer functions between these charts are always invertible . finally , if we compute @xmath97 and @xmath98 with the requirement that @xmath99 we end up with the following equations : @xmath100 summing the above equations we obtain @xmath101 hence , once we solve for @xmath87 the unknown function @xmath88 can be determined from @xmath102 since the variables @xmath103 and @xmath104 in ( [ eq_1 ] ) can be regarded as independent variables , we can set both sides in ( [ eq_1 ] ) equal to a separation constant @xmath105 . the factor",
    "@xmath106 has been introduced in order to simplify the left hand side of ( [ eq_1 ] ) .",
    "hence , the solutions read @xmath107 with @xmath108 . however , this condition on @xmath9 is always satisfied as we shall see in the next section .",
    "guided by the principle that we wish to derive the most simple expressions for @xmath56 and @xmath57 we can choose without loss of generality , @xmath109 . taking into account the definition of the tortoise coordinate @xmath104 we obtain , @xmath110      let @xmath111 denote the specific coordinates @xmath112 specialized for the region @xmath113 characterized by @xmath91 . in this region @xmath90 and equation ( [ condition ] ) requires that we choose @xmath87 and @xmath88 with a positive relative sign .",
    "this implies that the constants @xmath114 and @xmath115 have to be chosen with the same sign .",
    "the simplest choice is @xmath116 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath117 and @xmath118 in the next section we shall see that the requirement @xmath119 fixes the value of the separation constant @xmath9 .",
    "the constant @xmath120 can be fixed by requiring that the inverse transformation from the coordinates @xmath121 to the coordinates",
    "@xmath122 gives ( [ ncss ] ) again and we find that @xmath123 .",
    "thus , we conclude that @xmath124 clearly , we still have the possibility to choose the functions @xmath87 and @xmath88 both with negative signs so that their relative sign is again positive . in this case",
    "we get a new set of coordinates representing a portion of the manifold ( we call it region @xmath125 ) which is isometric to region @xmath113 . in particular ,",
    "the coordinates which map such a region are @xmath126 note that @xmath127 is always negative as it should be according to the present choice of the relative sign of the functions @xmath87 and @xmath88 whereas @xmath128 can assume both negative and positive values .",
    "region @xmath129 is obtained by deriving the corresponding transformation when the radial coordinate varies in the interval @xmath130 . in this case @xmath131 and the relative sign of the functions @xmath87 and @xmath88 must be negative . if we choose @xmath132 we get @xmath133 clearly , we are also free to make the opposite choice .",
    "this is equivalent to the transformation @xmath134 .",
    "thus , region @xmath135 is isometric to region @xmath129 and it is described by the coordinates @xmath136 in the next section we shall discuss that the overlapping conditions at @xmath95 are satisfied .",
    "it is evident that the inverse transformations can only be given implicitly since from ( [ stella ] ) we see that @xmath137 can not be inverted in terms of elementary functions .",
    "however , from the following relations @xmath138 we see that in the @xmath112-plane , the lines @xmath139const are straight lines @xmath140const whereas lines @xmath141const are represented by the hyperbolae @xmath142const .",
    "let us first consider the singularity at @xmath40 .",
    "lemma  [ lemma1 ] ensures that @xmath40 is a simple zero of the metric coefficient @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the following taylor expansion holds in a neighborhood of @xmath40 , namely @xmath143 with @xmath144 on the other hand the expansions of the tortoise coordinate @xmath104 and of the functions @xmath145 are @xmath146.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , we have @xmath147.\\ ] ] from lemma  [ lemma1 ] it follows that @xmath148 can never vanish and we can choose @xmath9 so that the singularity at @xmath40 is cancelled .",
    "this happens if @xmath9 is chosen to be @xmath149 clearly , it is not possible to cancel both singularities at once . in order to remove the singularity at @xmath41 we can proceed as we did above and we find that @xmath150 if we choose @xmath151 in the @xmath112 coordinates we can proceed from an arbitrarily large @xmath59 towards smaller @xmath59 across the set @xmath152 .",
    "if we want to continue further across @xmath153 we have to go back to the coordinates @xmath112 and choose @xmath154 . in this way we can continue across @xmath153 and reach @xmath19 since it is not a singularity for the metric ( [ ncss ] ) and even continue through this timelike surface .",
    "we now analyze the motion of a radial observer inside the noncommutative geometry inspired schwarzschild black hole . in doing",
    "so we will not address issues of stability which we postpone to a future investigation .",
    "when the observer enters the event horizon at @xmath37 but has still not crossed the second horizon at @xmath36 , the radial coordinate @xmath59 becomes timelike , implying that the motion proceeds with decreasing @xmath59 . once the observer has crossed the cauchy horizon at @xmath36 , the coordinate @xmath59 becomes spacelike again .",
    "this means that we have two possible kinds of motion given by increasing and decreasing values of @xmath59 . at this point",
    "the observer can take two decisions : either to cross the timelike surface @xmath19 in order to approach an asymptotically flat region or to reverse his / her course as is the case in the reissner - nordstrm metric @xcite . by taking the latter decision ,",
    "the observer will cross another copy of the surface @xmath153 .",
    "having entered the new region @xmath93 the radial coordinate becomes again timelike and the observer is forced to cross a new copy of the event horizon @xmath37 . in this way the observer will emerge out of a white hole in an asymptotically flat universe .",
    "however , the journey of the observer might not finish here since he still has the possibility to enter the noncommutative inspired schwarzschild black hole living in this new universe .",
    "[ myfigure ]    the result is the possibility to make a trip through an infinite number of universes connected by black hole tunnels . in order to depict the dynamics described above",
    "we shall construct a penrose diagram ( see fig .",
    "1 ) for the spacetime structure of the maximal extended schwarzschild solution inspired by noncommutative geometry .",
    "first of all , we observe that the radial null geodesics in the metric ( [ transf ] ) are @xmath155 .",
    "for this reason it is convenient to switch to null coordinates @xmath156 , @xmath157 with @xmath158 and @xmath159 in order to apply the so - called penrose transformation @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "it is clear from ( [ undici ] ) that the equation of the apparent singularity at @xmath37 reads @xmath162 .",
    "thus , in the @xmath163-plane the equation @xmath164 becomes @xmath165 whereas @xmath166 reads @xmath167 .",
    "moreover , the null infinities @xmath168 and @xmath169 are mapped into @xmath170 and @xmath171 . in this way we mapped the @xmath112-plane in the square @xmath172\\times[-1,1]$ ] where as usual we can introduce new coordinates @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "we recall that the coordinate singularity at @xmath37 has equation @xmath175 .",
    "the null infinities are now straight line segments with equations @xmath176 and @xmath177 , while the lines @xmath141const in the subspace @xmath178 which are represented by the hyperbolae @xmath142const are still hyperbolae in the @xmath179-plane with equation @xcite @xmath180=1,\\quad \\alpha:=\\frac{1-c}{1+c } , \\quad c:=e^{2pq}=\\mbox{const}.\\ ] ] concerning the regions @xmath181 we just repeat the above procedure with @xmath182 and @xmath183 . in this way we can patch together conformal diagrams of different parts of the original manifold and we end up with the penrose diagram shown in the rectangle in the centre of fig.1 . radial null geodesics would be represented by straight lines parallel to the horizons @xmath96 . since no future - directed null geodesic can go from region @xmath129 to region @xmath113 or @xmath125 we conclude that @xmath184 is an event horizon .",
    "note that the present situation is very different from the classical schwarzschild or the reissner - nordstrm case since there is no central singularity at all .",
    "this point allows to interpret the noncommutative inspired schwarzschild solution as a series of open tunnels connecting infinitely many asymptotically flat universes . however , there is also an alternative interpretation when we restrict our attention to the thick - line rectangle of fig.1 .",
    "in fact , we realize that the upper tunnel ( the strip where in the reissner - nordstrm case we would expect to have the central singularity ) is a copy of the lower tunnel . this suggests that we might identify the two tunnels . if we do that , the manifold becomes finite and cyclic in the timelike coordinate .",
    "in the extreme case @xmath13 the metric ( [ ncss ] ) becomes @xmath185 where @xmath186 is a differentiable and not vanishing function in the interval @xmath43 . in order to derive the maximal extension",
    "we shall follow the procedure adopted in @xcite . to this purpose",
    "we consider the surface @xmath178 and we write ( [ ncsse ] ) as follows : @xmath187\\left[dt + \\frac{dr}{(r - r_{0})^2\\phi(r)}\\right]\\ ] ] by introducing null coordinates @xmath188 and @xmath189 defined as @xmath190 @xmath191 our metric becomes @xmath192 where now @xmath59 is a function of @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the surface @xmath193 is made of radial null geodesics corresponding to lines parallel to @xmath194 and @xmath195 in the @xmath196-plane .",
    "[ myfigure1 ]    the metric ( [ ncsserf ] ) is regular for all real values of @xmath188 and @xmath189 . in order to understand where the coordinate singularity @xmath26 lies in the @xmath196-plane",
    "we need to study the signs of @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "first of all , notice that @xmath199 thus , the problem reduces to finding the signs of @xmath200 and @xmath201 . using the software maple we find the following numerical values @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "this implies that the coordinate singularity @xmath26 is at @xmath204 and @xmath205 when we move toward it from @xmath206 and at @xmath207 and @xmath208 when we approach it from @xmath209 , keeping in mind that these two regions will be covered by two different coordinate patches . with respect to the first coordinate patch",
    "the spatial infinity is at @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "again we can make the infinities finite by means of the transformation @xmath210 and @xmath211 , the nice feature of which is that we can lay the images of @xmath212 side by side in the two patches .",
    "with respect to the coordinate patch in the region @xmath206 the image of @xmath212 is the point with coordinates @xmath213 and @xmath214 whereas the choice of the coordinate patch relative to the region @xmath209 sends @xmath26 to @xmath215 and @xmath216 . in passing we",
    "note that spacelike infinity is mapped also to the point @xmath217 in the @xmath218-plane .",
    "putting all this information together we can construct an infinite chain of conformal diagrams as shown in fig.2 . in the present case the spacelike variable @xmath59 does not become timelike when we cross the event horizon .",
    "as we did in the non extreme case with respect to the thick - line rectangle we can identify the square at the bottom with the square at the top . proceeding like",
    "that we obtain a manifold which is cyclic in the timelike coordinate .",
    "if we divide the quantum black hole physics into the three categories : ( i ) problems zeroing around the central singularity ( final stage of a black hole ) @xcite , ( ii ) those zeroing around the horizon ( hawking evaporation ) @xcite and ( iii ) those around the question regarding the existence of bound orbits in the outer regions @xcite , this article addresses the first issue in the framework of noncommutative geometry .",
    "we found a maximal singularity - free extension of the noncommutative geometry inspired schwarzschild metric .",
    "the new coordinate chart we derived in the text has the advantage that we can illustrate more clearly the overall topology of the non extreme and extreme noncommutative geometry inspired schwarzschild manifold .",
    "the penrose diagrams are shown in figs.@xmath219 and @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "the most striking feature of the manifold is black hole tunnels connecting different universes and/or a cyclic structure of the manifold in the time coordinate after identification of two parts of the penrose diagram ( see fig .",
    "1 ) is performed .",
    "this together with the absence of a central singularity reveals the main difference as compared to the classical schwarzschild black hole structure . by some minor modification",
    "the method we used can be applied to derive the maximal extension of the noncommutative geometry inspired reissner - nordstrm black hole @xcite .",
    "finally , the stability issue of the tunnels has been examined in @xcite , where it has been shown that the cauchy horizon of the noncommutative geometry inspired schwarzschild black hole is stable under massless scalar perturbations governed by a wave equation modified accordingly to noncommutative geometry .",

    "<S> we derive a transformation of the noncommutative geometry inspired schwarzschild solution into new coordinates such that the apparent unphysical singularities of the metric are removed . moreover , we give the maximal singularity - free atlas for the manifold with the metric under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> this atlas reveals many new features e.g. it turns out to describe an infinite lattice of asymptotically flat universes connected by black hole tunnels . </S>"
