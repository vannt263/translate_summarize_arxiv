    ", step meandering is caused by an energy barrier , the ehrlich - schwoebel ( es ) barrier @xcite , which suppresses the attachment of surface atoms to the step from the terrace above .",
    "the preferential attachment from below implies that protrusions in the step are amplified , leading to a linear diffusional instability .",
    "recent experimental measurements of the meander wavelength on vicinal copper surfaces @xcite show significant disagreement with the predictions of the bz theory .",
    "this has lead to a search for alternative sources of instability @xcite .",
    "the most prominent alternative mechanism is the kink ehrlich - schwoebel effect ( kese ) , which invokes a kinetic barrier that prevents atoms diffusing along step edges to cross corners or kinks @xcite . in close analogy to the es instability of singular crystal surfaces @xcite , this induces a destabilizing mass current along the step .    in this article",
    "we present kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations of step meandering which display both types of instability within a single model .",
    "the relative importance of the kese vs. the bz instability can be tuned through the facility of step edge diffusion . by explicitly relating the parameters of the kmc model to those of the continuum theory ,",
    "we show that the meander wavelength can be quantitatively predicted in both instability regimes .",
    "our study thus proves the feasibility of extracting kinetic barriers from experimental meander morphologies .",
    "the simulations also provide some insight into the long - time behavior of the meander amplitude which can be compared to the predictions of nonlinear continuum equations @xcite .    the model employed in our work",

    "the simulation results are presented in section [ results ] .",
    "we provide some discussion of the applicability of the kese scenario to the experiments @xcite on cu(100 ) in section [ exps ] , and conclude in section [ conclusions ] .",

    "edge diffusion is facilitated compared to detachment if @xmath22 ( called hereafter _ model ii _ ) .",
    "model ii also contains a kink es barrier , since atoms can not round corners without detaching from the edge .",
    "the simulations were carried out on rectangular lattices with periodic boundary conditions in the step direction and helical boundary conditions in the direction of the vicinality .",
    "the initial step spacing was typically @xmath23 ( exceptions are noted in the figure captions ) .",

    "the temperature was @xmath29 k , the diffusion prefactor @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) for model i ( model ii ) and the deposition flux was varied in the range these choices were motivated mainly by our desire to study the variation of the meander wavelength over a range of control parameters without being strongly affected by finite size effects and limited computer time . in particular , the different diffusion prefactors for the two models were chosen only to be able to study both models in the same range of flux and temperature , and do not carry any physical significance .",

    "some aspects of the temporal evolution of the pattern will be addressed in sect.[time ] .",
    "before turning to the quantitative analysis of the simulations , we summarize the available theoretical predictions for the length scale of the meander instability .      the bz analysis proceeds by solving a diffusion equation for the adatom concentration with boundary conditions given by the attachment - detachment kinetics at the steps .",

    "we estimate @xmath54 in fact the rate of attachment from the upper terrace depends on the microscopic configuration of the step . a direct test of the relation ( [ k - coef ] )",
    "is presented below in sect.[schwoebel ] .",
    "the expression used above for the edge mobility @xmath38 is valid only on length scales longer than the kink distance @xmath55 . on shorter scales",
    "edge diffusion is much more efficient , and the expression for the characteristic meander wavelength must be replaced by@xcite @xmath56 when edge diffusion dominates and @xmath57 .",
    "step meandering due to the kese can be discussed @xcite in analogy to the es instability of a one - dimensional surface @xcite .",
    "the characteristic wavelength depends on the one - dimensional _ nucleation length _",

    "in contrast to the mobility @xmath38 , the edge diffusion coefficient @xmath65 refers to the motion of an edge atom along a _ straight _",
    "step without kinks , and is given by @xmath66 in the sos model .    it should be noted that ( [ weak1],[nuclen ] ) apply to a 1d surface in the absence of desorption ; for a step this translates into neglecting the detachment from the step .",
    "this approximation clearly breaks down as the bond breaking barrier @xmath8 approaches zero . including the detachment from the step introduces a new length scale into the problem , namely the diffusion length @xmath67 . here",
    "@xmath68 is the time an adatom diffuses along a straight step before being `` evaporated '' to the terrace , and @xmath69 the distance the atom travels along the step in time interval @xmath68 .",
    "a lower bound for @xmath68 is given by the detachment rate from the straight step @xmath70 .",
    "in reality detached atoms have a high probability of re - attachment and thus the real evaporation time @xmath68 is longer",
    ". a lower bound for the diffusion length then reads @xmath71 . repeating the calculation of the nucleation length for a 1d surface with desorption @xcite ,",
    "one arrives at an expression for the nucleation length in the limit @xmath72 , which reads @xmath73 the same result can be obtained also by applying the scaling arguments of jensen _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in one dimension . for general values of @xmath69",
    ", @xmath58 is given as the solution of a transcendental equation .",
    "a simple expression interpolating between the two cases ( [ nuclen ] ) and ( [ nuclen_det ] ) reads @xmath74.\\ ] ] in the case of a weak kese , repeating the calculation of politi and villain @xcite with desorption , one finds @xcite that for    @xmath75 the most unstable wavelength is of the order @xmath76 which replaces ( [ weak1 ] ) .",
    "figure [ wavelen ] shows the meander wavelength as a function of deposition flux obtained from our kmc simulations .",
    "the wavelength was extracted from the profiles directly by measuring the distance between subsequent minima in a single profile .",
    "the error bars refer to the variation of the wavelength within a single profile . for model",
    "i the wavelength is found to scale as @xmath77 , in qualitative agreement with both the bz - length @xmath78 and the nucleation length @xmath79 in the detachment - dominated limit ( eq.([nuclen_det ] ) ; for model i @xmath80 ) .",
    "quantitatively the results are found to agree with @xmath78 for the parameters used in the simulations , while the nucleation length @xmath79 is smaller by approximately a factor @xmath81 .",
    "a more convincing piece of evidence for the bales - zangwill mechanism is the dependence of the meander wavelength on the ehrlich - schwoebel barrier @xmath9 , which is discussed below in section [ schwoebel ] .",
    "the nucleation length is obviously independent of @xmath9 .    for model ii the meander wavelength scales as @xmath82 , which disagrees with the bz theory but is    consistent both with the modified bz length ( [ opl - edge - diff ] ) , and with the nucleation length ( [ nuclen ] ) in the absence of detachment .",
    "however , eq.([opl - edge - diff ] ) predicts a prefactor that is one order of magnitude too large .",
    "this is not surprising , since ( [ opl - edge - diff ] ) was derived for steps close to thermal equilibrium @xcite ; under growth conditions the kink density is much larger than its equilibrium value .    including detachment and using the lower bound @xmath71 as an approximation for the diffusion length yields an upper bound for the nucleation length .",
    "expressions ( [ nuclen ] ) and ( [ nuclen_intrp ] ) thus give lower and upper bounds for the nucleation length , which differ approximately by a factor of 2 .",
    "the lower bound ( [ nuclen ] ) is seen to quantitatively describe the simulation data for model ii , which shows that for model ii the detachment may be neglected .",
    "this confirms that one - dimensional nucleation is the relevant wavelength selection mechanism under conditions of facile edge diffusion , in accordance with the conclusions from previous experimental @xcite and simulational @xcite work on surfaces vicinal to cu(100 ) .",
    "the meander wavelength by itself does however not uniquely specify the instability mechanism .",
    "the bz theory predicts a band of unstable wavelengths extending over the interval @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath78 , as given by ( [ linstab ] ) , is the wavelength of perturbations with the maximal growth rate .",
    "numerical studies of a nonlinear evolution equation for the in - phase meander show that initial wavelengths between @xmath85 and @xmath86 are preserved during growth @xcite .",
    "thus deviations from the bz prediction ( [ linstab ] ) can be attributed partly to a wavelength different from @xmath78 which dominates the spectrum of initial perturbations . in this context",
    "it is important to note that , for small fluxes , the    wavelength measured for model ii is _ smaller _ than the minimal unstable wavelength @xmath85 of bz theory ; this can be seen by shifting the short - dashed line in fig.[wavelen ] , which represents @xmath78 for model ii , downward by a factor of @xmath87 .",
    "this proves that for model ii an instability mechanism different from the bz mechanism ",
    "the kese  is the cause of the meander .      which of the two meander mechanisms is operative depends on the importance of step edge diffusion and on the strength of the kese barrier .",
    "in our sos model both are controlled by the bond breaking barrier @xmath19 .",
    "thus decreasing @xmath19 should lead to a crossover from the kese instability to the bz instability .",
    "simulation results for various values of @xmath8 are shown in fig .",
    "[ wl_vs_ebb ] .",
    "the wavelength was determined by counting the number of minima in the step profile on a finite sample . reported",
    "wavelengths are averages over 5 independent runs and the error bars are the standard deviations . since the bond breaking barrier enters the kink energy through ( [ ek ] ) , the predicted length scales ( [ linstab ] ) and ( [ nuclen_intrp ] ) both increase with decreasing @xmath19 in a qualitatively similar manner .",
    "in addition , the decrease of the kese barrier implies a transition from the strong kese to the weak kese regime .",
    "the numerical data clearly show that for @xmath88 the meander wavelength is set by the nucleation length @xmath79 , while for @xmath89 ev the simulations are consistent only with the bz length , because the nucleation length is considerably smaller , and    the weak kese length ( [ weak ] ) is much larger than the actual meander wavelength .      as a further test of the bz prediction ( [ linstab ] )",
    "we have measured the meander wavelength in model i for different values of the es barrier . at @xmath29 k and with the barrier @xmath90 ev used above , the schwoebel length @xmath91 and @xmath92 , so that @xmath93 in eq . ( [ linstab ] ) . to study the effect of a finite es length we carried out simulations with a single terrace@xcite of width @xmath94 , varying the es barrier between @xmath95 ev and 0.20 ev ( @xmath96 ) , while keeping the other barriers at the values given previously .",
    "again , the average wavelengths were calculated from 5 independent runs .",
    "figure [ finite_les ] shows that the dependence of the meander wavelength on the es barrier is qualitatively described by bz theory , but eq.([linstab ] ) is not quantitatively accurate .",
    "the true es length appears to be smaller than that given in ( [ k - coef ] ) by about a factor 1/4 , which corresponds to a reduction of the es barrier by 0.04 ev .",
    "this can not be a simple effect of step roughness , since the implementation of the es barrier used in the present work in fact implies that the approach to a kinked step involves a _ higher _ barrier than to a straight step .",
    "this issue deserves further consideration .",
    "the two models can be distinguished with regard to the dynamics of meander formation . for model",
    "i the steps meander in - phase from the beginning , whereas for model ii the meander starts with random phase shifts between the steps ( compare the early time configurations in    figures [ 3d - prof_i ] and [ 3d - prof_ii ] ) .",
    "later on , as the meander amplitude grows and the step - step interaction through the diffusion field becomes effective , the correlations between the steps grow , leading asymptotically to an in - phase step train . in the light of the two different mechanisms these observations are easy to understand : since for model i the meander is due to the bz instability , the step train is expected to be in - phase from the beginning , this being the fastest growing mode @xcite ; for model ii the meander starts independently at each step since the meander is due to the local adatom dynamics at the step edge .",
    "we turn next to the time evolution of the meander amplitude , which also differs for the two models ( fig.[wi_vs_ml ] ) .",
    "we consider the step width @xmath97 defined by @xmath98^{2 } , \\ ] ] where the @xmath99-coordinate is directed along the step , @xmath100 is the step length and @xmath101 is the step position relative to its mean . for model ii , @xmath102 increases very rapidly at the beginning , but asymptotically saturates @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for model i the step width was found to increase linearly in time for the longest times we could access@xcite .",
    "both observations are at variance with the predictions of a nonlinear step evolution equation for the in - phase meander @xcite , which predicts that @xmath103",
    ".    our results also contradict earlier monte - carlo simulation @xcite , in which the steps were described by single valued functions , thus prohibiting step overhangs and voids , and nucleation on the terraces was not allowed for . in these simulations a regime with @xmath103 was observed at long times .",
    "a direct comparison of the two sets of simulations is not possible , however , because of the rather different choice of parameters . in the earlier work @xcite , the concentration of adatoms was set to a value @xmath104 , which is several orders of magnitude larger than in our simulations .",
    "in fact , at such high adatom concentrations step flow is hardly possible , if the nucleation on the terraces is not artificially suppressed .",
    "for this reason we can not reproduce the conditions used in the earlier simulations@xcite .    the linear amplitude growth in model i suggests that minima and maxima of the step meander move at different velocities",
    ". this may be due to diffusional screening which prevents adatoms to reach the narrow fjords separating the cells in the upper panel of fig.[averprof ] .",
    "in model ii the fjords are wider , because adatoms are able to fill them up through edge diffusion .",
    "the saturation of the amplitude in model ii may be related to the stabilizing character of the kese step current at large slopes @xcite .",
    "in this section we briefly comment on the relevance of our work for the experimentally observed meander instability @xcite on surfaces vicinal to cu(100 ) . in these experiments two different vicinal surfaces were considered , which consist of dense packed @xmath105 steps , and open @xmath106 steps , respectively .    for the dense packed @xmath105 steps ,",
    "edge diffusion is much more facile than detachment , so the scenario of our model ii should apply . indeed , using the expression ( [ nuclen ] ) for the one - dimensional nucleation length to interpret the experimentally measured activation energy @xmath107 of the meander wavelength , @xmath108 , one obtains an energy barrier @xmath109 for diffusion along a straight edge , which is consistent with the estimate @xmath110 derived from the analysis of time - dependent stm observations @xcite . also the flux dependence of ( [ nuclen ] ) as @xmath111 agrees with the experimental power law exponent of @xmath112 .",
    "what is missing to complete the picture is some direct experimental evidence for a ( strong ) kese at the @xmath105 step @xcite .",
    "here we want to point out that indirect evidence for a kink es barrier follows from a comparison of the growth experiments @xcite with step fluctuation measurements . using the accepted value @xcite @xmath113 for the kink energy , the measurement of the prefactor of the temporal step correlation function @xcite yields the estimate @xmath114 for the activation energy of the step edge mobility @xmath38 .",
    "it was mentioned above in section [ predictions ] that , in the absence of a strong kese , this can be identified with the energy barrier @xmath115 for the detachment of a step adatom from a kink . in a simple bond counting approximation ( which is supported by effective medium ( emt ) @xcite and embedded atom ( eam ) @xcite calculations ) the detachment barrier",
    "is given by @xmath116 .",
    "using the value of @xmath117 determined from the meander wavelength of the @xmath105 step this yields @xmath118 , which is much smaller than the step fluctuation estimate of @xmath119 .",
    "the discrepancy strongly suggests that the migration of atoms along the kinked step is suppressed by an additional kink es barrier @xmath120 .",
    "the quantitative analysis @xcite shows that for @xmath121 , the activation energy for @xmath38 is given by @xmath122 , which , using the numbers quoted above , yields the estimate @xmath123 . in agreement with semiempirical calculations @xcite ,",
    "the additional kink barrier is found to be comparable to the barrier @xmath117 for diffusion along a straight step .",
    "the situation is rather different for the open @xmath106 step , at which a meander instability with similar characteristics has been observed @xcite .",
    "_ identify the measured wavelength for the open step with the one - dimensional nucleation length ( [ nuclen ] ) .",
    "this interpretation seems questionable for the following two reasons .",
    "first , since the open step can be viewed as being composed entirely of @xmath105 kinks , the edge diffusion barrier @xmath117 is expected to be much larger than along the close packed step @xcite , while the additional barrier for detachment from a kink ( which is related to the energy of @xmath124 kinks ) is much smaller @xcite . under these conditions the initial growth of the step is not well described by the picture of one - dimensional nucleation .",
    "second , symmetry arguments @xcite show that the step edge current induced by the kese should _ stabilize _ , rather than destabilize the open step . thus the mechanism which could lead to an instability on the scale of the nucleation length",
    "is absent .",
    "this leaves the bz instability as the most plausible instability mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , neither the activation energy ( as estimated from known energetic parameters @xcite ) nor the @xmath125-dependence predicted by ( [ linstab ] ) matches the experimentally determined meander wavelength @xcite .",
    "in addition , in kmc simulations of cu(100 ) , the surface composed of @xmath106 steps was found to be stable @xcite ; possibly this reflects the stabilizing kese .",
    "the experimentally observed instability of the open step thus poses a major puzzle at the moment .",
    "in summary , we have studied the unstable growth dynamics of vicinal surfaces using an sos model with two different choices of atomic processes .",
    "it was shown that in both cases the steps form an in - phase wave pattern . the formation mechanism and",
    "the wavelength of the pattern depends on whether the diffusion of adatoms along the step edges is significant or not . in the case where step edge diffusion is negligible",
    "the wavelength was found to be correctly predicted by the continuum theory of bz , while in the case of facile edge diffusion ( combined with an es barrier at kinks ) it is set by the one - dimensional nucleation length .    in both cases",
    "good agreement between the kmc simulations and the analytic predictions ( [ linstab ] ) and ( [ nuclen ] ) for the meander wavelength was achieved _ without any adjustable parameters_.",
    "however , the asymptotic time evolution of the step profile disagrees with the prediction of an effective step evolution equation @xcite .",
    "whether this disagreement is due to different physics described by the continuum and discrete models or due to the approximations made deriving the step equation remains to be clarified .",
