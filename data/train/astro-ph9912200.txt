    "massive hot stars are relevant objects in many areas of astrophysics .",
    "they are the main sources of photoionization of their surrounding interstellar medium , and they contribute to the chemical and dynamical evolution of the host galaxy through their stellar winds and supernova explosions .",
    "they are also the precursors of wolf  rayet stars and lbvs and constitute excellent probes of evolutionary models . for these reasons , advances in our understanding of these objects have an impact on other fields of astrophysics .    in spite of all this",
    ", few attempts have been made to analyse massive o stars quantitatively .",
    "the most comprehensive study up to now has been that of herrero et al .",
    "( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) , who analysed 24 stars from spectral types b0 to o5 .",
    "detailed quantitative analyses of massive stars of early spectral type have been even more scarce .",
    "conti & frost ( @xcite ) first made a systematic analysis of the earliest spectral types , comparing with theoretical predictions by auer & mihalas ( @xcite ) , but only for gravities of @xmath5= 4.0 .",
    "later , kudritzki ( @xcite ) studied hd  93250 , an o3  v star , using models similar to those of auer & mihalas ( @xcite ) , and kudritzki et al .",
    "( @xcite ) studied the spectrum of @xmath6 pup and showed that the star has a low gravity ( of the order of @xmath5= 3.5 ) and a high helium abundance ( @xmath7= @xmath8(he)/(@xmath8(h)+@xmath8(he))= 0.14 ) .",
    "kudritzki & hummer ( @xcite ) list 15 stars earlier than spectral type o6 ( only three classified as supergiants ) , with parameters determined using the same methods .",
    "puls et al .",
    "( @xcite ) list 22 stars earlier than o6 in the milky way and the magellanic clouds , still taking advantage of the optical analysis , but already incorporating the effects of sphericity and mass - loss .",
    "pauldrach et al .",
    "( @xcite ) analysed melnick 42 and @xmath6 pup , using only the uv spectrum , and taresch et al .",
    "( @xcite ) made a very detailed analysis of hd 93129a using the uv and fuv spectrum .",
    "finally , de koter ( @xcite ) has used the uv ov   line at 1371    to determine the temperature of very hot stars in r136a .",
    "all these studies have revealed a number of problems in the analyses of these stars , related to our incomplete understanding of these objects . in paper",
    "i , the so  called helium and mass discrepancies , already present in the previous literature ( see kudritzki et al .",
    "@xcite ; voels et al .",
    "@xcite ; groenewegen et al .",
    "@xcite ; herrero et al .",
    "@xcite ) were shown to be systematic .",
    "these refer to the discrepancy in the values of the stellar mass and the photospheric helium abundance obtained from the analysis of the spectrum using state - of - the - art model atmospheres and evolutionary models .",
    "the explanation of these discrepancies is still unclear ( for recent working directions , see howarth @xcite ) .    in paper",
    "i we already noted the correlation between the mass discrepancy and the distance of the star to the eddington limit , indicating that the plane ",
    "parallel geometry and the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption could be the reason for the low stellar masses derived .",
    "however , the use of wind techniques in the same work already indicated that the discrepancy could be reduced , but not solved , by including mass - loss and sphericity effects .",
    "this was later confirmed in an analysis of hde  226868 ( herrero et al .",
    "@xcite ) , where the authors used unified model atmospheres to determine the mass of this star , the optical counterpart of cygnus x1 , by combining the spectroscopic analysis with the orbital data .",
    "a similar result has been obtained by israelian et al .",
    "( @xcite ) in an analysis of hd  188209 .",
    "the inclusion of mass - loss and sphericity did not seem to have any effect on the helium discrepancy either ( herrero et al . ,",
    "@xcite ) in spite of the variations that strong winds could introduce in the helium profiles as compared to static , plane  parallel atmospheres ( schaerer & schmutz @xcite ) .",
    "one of the reasons for this weak influence was the fact that the study in paper i was limited to spectral types of o5 or later , because it was found that above 40000  k the neutral helium singlet and triplet lines gave different stellar parameters .",
    "herrero ( @xcite ) suggested that this was due to the neglect of the so - called _ line - blocking _ , the uv background opacity due to metal lines , during the line formation calculations .",
    "also the inclusion of microturbulence in these calculations can reduce this difference ( mcerlean @xcite ; smith & howarth @xcite ; villamariz & herrero , in prep . ) .",
    "in this paper we study a few stars of early spectral type in an attempt to cover several objectives .",
    "first , we would like to extend our sample from paper i towards earlier spectral types and thus cover the whole region of interest in the hr diagram with plane  parallel analyses to see their complete behaviour .",
    "although the plane  parallel models will have difficulties in explaining even the optical spectrum of these very hot stars ( see sect .",
    "[ anap ] ) , this first step is needed for the subsequent application of more sophisticated models , which will use the experience gained and the parameters obtained as input .",
    "an analysis of line - blocking effects is mandatory here , as it has been seen to have an influence for the higher temperatures .",
    "then , we will repeat the analyses using spherical models with mass - loss , and present the study of some effects that both can influence the determination of stellar parameters and that will help us to gain new insight into the physics of these stars . having these parameters determined , we can try to establish conclusions with respect to the use of different model atmospheres and techniques for the analysis of very early spectral types .",
    "we will compare the results of the spherical models with mass - loss with those from plane ",
    "parallel , hydrostatic model atmospheres as well as with the results obtained using the somewhat approximate technique employed by puls et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .    in sect .",
    "[ secobs ] we present the observations .",
    "the effects of line - blocking in plane ",
    "parallel models are treated in sect .",

    "[ numef ] contains a qualitative study of some effects of interest which explain some difficulties found in the preceding section .",
    "then we present our discussion ( sect .",
    "[ discu ] ) and conclusions ( sect .",
    "[ conc ] ) .",
    "the observations were carried out with the 2.5  m isaac newton telescope at the roque de los muchachos observatory on la palma during two different observational runs , in 1991 september and 1992 august . we have observed the spectral region between 4000 and 5000  , and the region around h@xmath1 .",
    "the intermediate dispersion spectrograph was used with the h 2400 b grid in the blue and the h 1800 v grid in the red , attached to the 235 mm camera , which resulted in spectral resolutions of 0.6 and 0.8  , respectively , measured on the cu  ar arc .",
    "the main difference between both runs was the size of the ccd detector , with a larger wavelength coverage per exposure ( 400    instead of 220    in the blue ) during the second run .",
    "table  [ obs ] gives the stellar identification ( usually the hd number ) , star name , ob association to which the star belongs , spectral type and the night in which the stellar spectrum was obtained .",
    "[ obs ]    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ vescfig ] shows the correlation between escape velocities and terminal wind velocities .",
    "we see that the diagram using evolutionary masses shows a good linear correlation between both quantities , whereas that with the spectroscopic masses shows a weaker correlation .",
    "however , the last diagram is in better agreement with the theory of radiatively driven winds .",
    "this theory predicts for the o - star domain ( i.e. , if the force - multiplier parameter @xmath9 is small , cf .",
    "friend & abbott @xcite ; kudritzki et al .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath10 with @xmath11 the escape velocity and @xmath12 one of the line force multiplier parameters ( the coefficient in the exponent of the line strength distribution function ) . with typical values for ob stars of @xmath12=",
    "0.60.7 we obtain values of 3.35.2 for the ratio of terminal - to - escape velocity .",
    "this range of values is in agreement with those found here for the spectroscopic masses ( see table  [ vesc ] ; note that the only point deviating from this range corresponds to hd15570 , whose gravity and spectroscopic mass are very uncertain , and that hd5689 , which is the leftmost point in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ vescfig ] , would lie in the middle of the range if the absolute magnitude of a luminosity class iii object were assumed ) .",
    "on the other hand , we derive very low ratios between terminal and escape velocities when using evolutionary masses ( see table  [ vesc ] ) , with an average ratio of 2.57 , corresponding to @xmath12= 0.53 ( which would be very low for the considered spectral range ) . thus , fig .",
    "[ vescfig ] seems to indicate that the evolutionary masses are _ systematically _ too large ( via the corresponding escape velocities ) , whereas the spectroscopic ratios are closer to the theoretically expected range . in fig .",
    "29 we can see this result , already contained in former papers ( groenewegen et al .",
    "@xcite ; lamers & leitherer @xcite ) , from a slightly different point of view . here",
    "we have plotted the ratio of evolutionary - to - spectroscopic mass versus the ratio of spectroscopic - to - evolutionary @xmath12 .",
    "we see that , except for the odd case hd5689 , there is a strong correlation , indicating the relation between mass discrepancy and our present knowledge of radiatively driven winds .",
    "( note moreover that hd5689 would perfectly fit into the correlation when an absolute magnitude of -5.78 is assumed , as appropriate for an o6 iii star , but note also that the terminal velocity for this star was derived from the spectral type  terminal velocity relation from haser @xcite , as was that of cyg ob2@xmath137 )",
    ". we should stress that we adopt a @xmath14law for the wind velocity and determine then the @xmath12 s directly from the derived relation between @xmath15and escape velocity .",
    "thus the agreement of the spectroscopic @xmath12 s with the predictions of the radiatively driven wind velocity results in mutual support .    at present",
    "it is still unclear whether the inconsistency found is due to some physical effects that should be incorporated into the evolutionary or into the atmospheric models , although the former are perfectly able to explain the discrepancy , at least qualitatively , when introducing mixing effects ( heger @xcite ) that could also affect surface abundances .",
    "[ alfarat ]    spherical models with mass - loss do not contribute to reduce the helium abundances found with plane ",
    "parallel models . in previous analyses ( herrero et al .",
    "@xcite ; israelian et al .",
    "@xcite ) in which we used hei   @xmath164387 , 4922 and heii   @xmath04541 as temperature indicators , the derived helium abundances were similar . as a result of the new indicator , the helium abundances had now to increase . however , we see that the stars of larger gravity ( hd 15558 and hd 15629 ) do not seem to show he overabundances .",
    "normal supergiants lie between the former and the fast rotators , that show the largest overabundances , in agreement with results from paper i and the possibility that rotation plays a fundamental role in the chemical evolution of single stars .",
    "however , it is not clear whether a difference exists in the mass discrepancy between the rapid rotators and the other stars , or a correlation between the mass and helium discrepancies , that could indicate an overluminous evolution , as predicted by evolutionary rotating models ( see langer & heger @xcite , maeder @xcite or meynet @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we should stress here that we do not consider hd 5689 as really showing such a large mass discrepancy as it appears to do in tables 2 and 3 , but that it is a problem of the stellar classification ( or a problem of assigning the star to the cas ob7 association ) .",
    "derivation of the mass  loss rates has been hindered by our finding of the inconsistency between h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 in those cases in which the wind is particularly strong .",
    "thus we have found that both lines can demand mass  loss rates that differ up to a factor of two .",
    "we prefer the values given by h@xmath1because it is more sensitive to mass - loss , and attribute the problem to difficulties in describing the wind in the transition zone .",
    "ir observations and analyses giving information about this zone should help in the future to solve the problem",
    ".    from the three stars for which we had some information about mass  loss rates derived from radio emission , only one ( for which in addition only an upper limit from radio fluxes is available ) shows agreement between the h@xmath1 and radio values . for the other two , radio mass  loss rates are a factor of three to four lower than h@xmath1 mass  loss rates ( and",
    "thus h@xmath2 values would be in between ) .",
    "however , several facts should be taken into account before claiming that there is a contradiction between both sets of values .",
    "first , the concerned stars are only two particular , rather special cases ( one , hd15570 , is a very extreme o star , and the other , hd210839 , is a strong non - radial pulsator , rapid rotator with a probably non  spherically symmetric wind , cf .",
    "5.2 ) ; secondly , what we actually obtain from the observations are q values , proportional to ( @xmath17 ) for h@xmath1 , and to ( @xmath18 ) for radio and thus the derived values depend on the particular set of chosen stellar parameters ; and thirdly , also the proportionality constants in the case above depend on model details ( for example , lamers & leitherer @xcite , assume that he is doubly ionized in the wind of hd210839 between 10 and 100 stellar radii , whereas our calculations indicate that from 28 stellar radii upwards , he is single ionized , which would have an immediate effect on the derived radio mass  loss rates , increasing them ) . thus , we can not state that there is a general problem ( or even a particular one ) , or decide which value we should prefer for each object .",
    "having derived all parameters we can obtain the modified wind momenta of all stars for which the radiation - driven wind predicts a tight correlation with luminosity .",
    "our results are given in table 3 and plotted in fig .",
    "[ wlrfig ] , together with the data given by puls et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for galactic supergiants .",
    "we see that our points for supergiants agree well with theirs ( we have discussed the differences in the individual studies ) .",
    "we have also plotted the regression lines derived from the supergiants from puls et al . and",
    "from all the supergiants ( the former and ours ) to stress this point .",
    "we see that both regression lines are quite parallel , indicating that the new values do not significantly change the known wlr .",
    "we have presented the spectra of seven galactic luminous o stars , that have been analysed by means of non - lte , plane ",
    "parallel , hydrostatic model atmospheres , including line - blocking , and by means of spherical , mass - losing models .",
    "we have used these analyses to study some additional effects ( physical as well as due to applied approximations ) that have an influence on the results .",
    "we have shown that line - blocking has to be taken into account when analysing very hot stars , in plane  parallel as well as in spherical models with mass - loss .",
    "line - blocking indirectly affects the spectral - line diagnostics through changes in the level populations of he .",
    "although for the spherical models with mass - loss we only made simulations , this is clearly one direction for future model improvements . in particular , we obtained very interesting results concerning the heii@xmath04686 line and the blue wing of h@xmath1(actually , concerning the corresponding heiiblend ) .",
    "one of the conclusions of the present paper is that around 50000 k ( the exact value depending on gravity ) we reach the limit of applicability of plane  parallel , hydrostatic models to real massive stars .",
    "this conclusion can be further refined , if we take into account the fact that line - blanketed models could give lower temperatures , or if we consider that spherical models with mass - loss will demand larger gravities .",
    "the final result would be models less affected by radiation pressure , larger masses and a cooler temperature scale .",
    "spherical models with mass - loss are thus needed to analyse these stars . we had to correct the gravities of all stars ( except hd 5689 ) when using these models , sometimes with increments as large as 0.25 dex .",
    "part of the differences in the stellar parameters derived from both sets of models are due to a change in the preferred temperature indicator",
    ".    our spherical models with mass - loss are also still not free from internal inconsistencies .",
    "for some models with strong winds , we see that heii@xmath164200 , 4541 give different temperatures , although we expect that inclusion of line - blocking will reduce this discrepancy , and will strongly improve the fits of heii@xmath04686 and the blue wing of h@xmath1 . we have also found that for stars with strong winds there is a difference in the mass  loss rates derived from h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 , that can reach a factor of two .",
    "we do not find good agreement with the two cases for which we have mass  loss rates from radio fluxes , although it is not possible to derive any firm conclusion from this fact .",
    "the helium and mass discrepancies found here are in agreement with the findings of paper i. the only difference is that we find a mass discrepancy also for luminosity class v stars , but this is actually misleading .",
    "what we find is that the luminosity class v stars analysed here have gravities lower than usual for their spectral classification .",
    "the conclusion of paper i should then be changed to state that we do not find the mass discrepancy for stars with high gravities .",
    "at least a part of this effect is attributed to the fact that the intense radiation field affects the wings of the balmer lines also for these stars .",
    "an additional possibility is that they actually never reach the zero - age main sequence ( see , for example , hanson @xcite ) .",
    "spherical models with mass - loss largely reduce the mass discrepancy . without solving it completely , the problem lies now in the systematic trend of spectroscopic values to be lower than evolutionary ones , but most of the individual values now agree within the formal error bars .",
    "we have also shown that the spectroscopic masses agree better with the predictions from the radiatively driven wind theory , because they give ratios of the terminal wind velocity to the escape velocity ( or equivalently , values of the @xmath12 line force parameter ) that are in the range predicted by that theory .    from the point of view of individual stars ,",
    "we have analysed some of the most massive and luminous stars in the milky way .",
    "we have found that three of them ( cyg ob2 @xmath137 , hd15570 and hd15558 ) have particularly large initial masses , around or in excess of 100 @xmath4(depending on the technique used for the mass derivation ) .",
    "cyg ob2@xmath137 , hd14947 and hd210839 have so extreme mass  loss rates that the wings of h@xmath2 are strongly affected , and in hd15570 the wind is so strong that the exercise of deriving the gravity from the wings of h@xmath2 results in highly uncertain values . on the other hand , we find that hd 5689 , the less luminous object in our sample , could have been wrongly assigned to cas ob7 , and might be a runaway star .",

    "<S> we present observations and analyses of seven galactic o stars of type o6 and earlier . </S>",
    "<S> the analyses are carried out using nlte plane  </S>",
    "<S> parallel , hydrostatic models as well as nlte spherical models with mass - loss . with detailed calculations for the former and simulations for the latter </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that the flux blocking due to uv metal lines is important for these objects , in agreement with previous studies , and the way the mechanism operates is explained . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the plane  </S>",
    "<S> parallel , hydrostatic unblanketed model atmospheres have increasing difficulties in fitting the early - type spectra of massive stars , and for 50000  k and above a fit seems to be impossible . </S>",
    "<S> the gravities derived are relatively low even for the luminosity class v stars . </S>",
    "<S> these objects also show the mass discrepancy found in earlier studies , indicating that sphericity and mass - loss are important , even at their higher gravities . </S>",
    "<S> we then perform an analysis using spherical models with mass - loss . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that gravities should be increased by 0.10.25 dex , reducing , but not solving , the mass discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> we show that spectroscopic masses are in better agreement with the theory of radiatively driven winds than evolutionary masses are . </S>",
    "<S> a helium abundance larger than solar is also obtained for most objects . + some additional effects ( partly related to present approximations ) that have an influence in our analyses are studied . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that heii@xmath04200 is less sensitive to details of the model calculations than heii@xmath04541 and thus it is preferred for temperature determinations , with the consequence of lower effective temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the fits to heii@xmath04686 are improved when the upward rates of the heii resonance lines are reduced ( with respect to the conventional treatment adequate for lines formed in expanding atmospheres ) , either by setting them in detailed balance or by artificially adding extra opacity sources that simulate line blocking . the heii blend with h@xmath1 is also affected . </S>",
    "<S> + some stars of our sample have such high mass  loss rates that the derivation of gravities from the wings of balmer lines , in particular h@xmath2 , becomes doubtful . for the most extreme objects , the mass  loss rates needed to fit h@xmath1   are different from those needed to fit h@xmath2 , by a maximum factor of two . </S>",
    "<S> + from the point of view of individual stars , we have analysed some of the most massive and luminous stars in the milky way . according to our analysis </S>",
    "<S> , three of them ( cyg ob2 @xmath3 , hd 15570 and hd15558 ) have particularly large initial masses , close to or in excess of 100 @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the least luminous object in our sample , hd 5689 , could have been erroneously assigned to cas ob7 and might be a runaway star . </S>"
