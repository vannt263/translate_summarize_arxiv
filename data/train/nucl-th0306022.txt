    "the @xmath4-decay results have been used for identifying the shell closure effects for quite some time now , including even the very weak , sub - shell closures .",
    "for example , the z=64 sub - shell was first noted by observing the systematics of @xmath4-decay energies @xcite , and later by a dip at z=64 in the measured @xmath4-decay reduced widths @xcite , of a few n=84 isotones in its neighborhood . in the recent past ,",
    "some of us and collaborators @xcite have coupled the @xmath4-decay studies with the exotic cluster - decay result of the observed spherical closed - shell daughter ( @xmath13pb or a neighbouring nucleus ) , called cluster radioactivity @xcite .",
    "this allowed us to predict two other new spherical closed - shell daughter radioactivies , namely @xmath14sn and @xmath15sn daughter radioactivies @xcite , and also a deformed daughter radioactivity at z=74 - 76 and n=98 - 104 @xcite .",
    "the spherical @xmath14sn daughter radioactivity has been emphasized also by poenaru , greiner and gherghescu @xcite , and a couple of , so - far unsuccessful , experimental attempts have also been made to observe it as the ground - state decay of @xmath16ba nucleus produced in heavy - ion reactions @xcite .",
    "this decay is now believed to belong to an excited compound nucleus decay , studied for @xmath9c decay of @xmath17ba@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the cluster decay studies are also used to point out the shell stabilizing effects of the parent nucleus @xcite .",
    "thus , both the cases of large and small decay rates ( equivalently , the small and large decay half - lives ) are found important , the large ones refering to closed shell effects of the daughter nucleus and the small ones to closed shell effects of the parent nucleus .",
    "in other words , taking a clue from the experiments , in a decay calculation , the presence of a known spherical or deformed daughter should result in a large decay rate ( small decay half - life ) or alternatively , a large decay rate ( small decay half - life ) should refer to the existence of a known or un - known ( new ) , spherical or deformed , closed shell for the daughter nucleus .",
    "in the above mentioned calculations , we have so - far investigated the alpha and/or cluster decays of various neutron - deficient and neutron - rich rare - earths @xmath19xe to @xmath20gd @xcite and the even - a deformed and superdeformed @xmath21hg nuclei @xcite . in mercury nuclei",
    ", the superdeformation begins at the @xmath22hg isotope , and the axes ratios are @xmath231.7:1 @xcite .",
    "note that the superdeformation here refers to the observation of ( excited ) superdeformed band(s ) in these nuclei , though their ground - state deformations are not very much different from other neighbouring nuclei .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , where the data for ground - state quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath24 is taken from the calculations of mller et al .",
    "@xcite , since a similar data from experiments is not available for all the nuclei studied here . on the other hand ,",
    "a deformed or normal deformed nucleus is one where superdeformed band(s ) are not observed and it comes from the well known mass region @xmath25 of deformation . in the above stated nuclei , the closed shell effects of both the daughter products and the parent nuclei were analyzed .",
    "the stability of parent nuclei was also studied for the mass region a=68 - 82 @xcite , which includes several deformed and superdeformed nuclei ( here , both in the ground states ) .",
    "however , there are several other regions of various deformations and superdeformations in the mass regions a=130 - 158 and 180 - 198 @xcite whose decay characteristics still remain to be probed .",
    "the aim of this paper is to make a complete analysis of the decay properties of nuclei in these two mass regions , in order to get a general picture of how the deformed , in particular the superdeformed , nuclei behave against the @xmath4 and heavier cluster decays .",
    "the superdeformed nuclei are expected to be more instable , though , like for the mass region a=68 - 82 @xcite , the following analysis does not seem to support this contention .",
    "instead , the superdeformed nuclei are found to be rather poor @xmath4 emitters , as compared to their lower mass , normal deformed nuclei .",
    "they are , however , shown to be the better @xmath4 emitters than the heavier mass ( heavier than superdefomed nuclei ) , normal deformed nuclei .",
    "the same is found true for cluster decay results .",
    "such an un - expected situation is presented by the presence of known and/or un - known ( new ) closed shell effects of the daughter products . also , the closed shell effects of either the protons or neutrons , as well as the neutron / proton asymmetry , of the parent nucleus play a role .",
    "the other nuclei that have superdeformations identical to those of @xmath26hg nuclei are the @xmath27au , @xmath28tl , @xmath29pb and @xmath30bi nuclei .",
    "then , there are several rare - earths , from @xmath31sm to @xmath32dy and @xmath33er , which have even more strongly superdeformed shapes with axes ratios @xmath232:1 . also , some other rare - earths , the @xmath34la to @xmath35nd , have superdeformed species with axes ratios @xmath231.5:1 . in this paper",
    ", we choose to work specifically with both the odd- and even - a @xmath0nd , @xmath1gd and @xmath36pb parents , which comprise the three regions of different superdeformations mentioned above , along with some normal deformed nuclei .",
    "note that @xmath37gd are known @xmath4-stable nuclei , but are found to be of interest from the point of view of heavy - cluster instabilities and the associated closed shell effects ( section iii.b.2 ) .",
    "we have also included in our analysis here , the already studied @xcite mercury nuclei , extended to both the odd- and even - a @xmath2hg , and the heavier @xmath5pb nuclei where some experimental data for @xmath4-decays are available .",
    "thus , the cases of both the normal deformed and superdefomed nuclei , and the spherical closed shell nuclei at and around z=82 , n=126 , are covered in our study .",
    "figure 1 shows that all the superdeformed nuclei chosen here come from the transition ( both lighter and heavier ) regions of known deformed nuclei in the mass region @xmath25 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the calculations are made by using the preformed cluster - decay model ( pcm ) of gupta and collaborators @xcite whose brief outline is presented in section ii .",
    "section iii deals with the calculations and results obtained from this study .",
    "a summary of our results and conclusions are presented in section iv .",
    "the preformed cluster - decay model ( pcm ) is a well established method for cluster decay studies .",
    "we refer the reader to original papers @xcite or the reviews in refs .",
    "@xcite for complete details on the model . in the pcm , the decay constant @xmath38 ( or , inversely , the decay half - life time t@xmath39 ) is the product of the cluster preformation probability p@xmath40 , the barrier impinging frequency @xmath41 , and the barrier penetration probability p , = ln2=p_0_0p .",
    "[ eq:1 ] for calculating p@xmath40 and p , the authors introduced , respectively , the dynamical collective coordinate of mass asymmetry @xmath42=(a@xmath43-a@xmath44)/a , with a = a@xmath43+a@xmath44 , and relative separation r between the two fragments , via the stationary schrdinger equation h(,r)_n(,r)=e_n_n(,r ) . [ eq:2 ] the potential part of the hamiltonian in this equation is defined by v(,r)=_i=1 ^ 2 b_i(a_i , z_i)++v_p , [ eq:3 ] given as the sum of the experimental binding energies @xcite and the coulomb and nuclear proximity @xcite potentials .",
    "the fragmentation potential v(@xmath42 ) and the scattering potential v(r ) are obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) , respectively , for fixed r and @xmath42 .",
    "the r is fixed at the touching configuration , r = c@xmath45=c@xmath43+c@xmath44 , the c@xmath46 being the sssmann central radii @xmath47 ( in fm ) with r@xmath46 as the equivalent spherical radii @xmath48 fm ; and @xmath42 is fixed by the emitted cluster .",
    "the charges z@xmath46 in ( [ eq:3 ] ) are fixed by minimizing the potential ( without vp ) in the charge asymmetry coordinate @xmath49=(z@xmath43-z@xmath44)/z , with z = z@xmath43+z@xmath44 .    in principle ,",
    "the two coordinates are coupled , but in view of the defining equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) , the schrdinger equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) is solved in the decoupled approximation of @xmath42 and r - motions . only the ground - state ( @xmath50=0 ) solution is relevant for the cluster decay to occur in the ground - state of the daughter nucleus .",
    "then , for @xmath42 motion , the properly normalized fractional cluster preformation probability is p_0(a_2)=|()|^2 , [ eq:4 ] with @xmath51 taken as the classical hydrodynamical mass of krger and scheid @xcite . for the r - motion",
    ", we use the wkb approximation for calculating the penetrability p. in pcm , the penetration is considered to begin at @xmath52 and end at @xmath53=q - value of the decay .",
    "finally , the impinging frequency @xmath41 in the pcm is defined by considering that the total kinetic energy , shared between the two fragments , is the positive q - value .",
    "then , _ 0=velocity=. [ eq:5 ] here r@xmath40 is the equivalent spherical radius of the parent nucleus and ma@xmath44 is the mass of emitted cluster .",
    "in this section , we present our calculations first for @xmath4-decay , compared with the experimental data , wherever available .",
    "then , we analyze the cluster - decay calculations with a view to look for the role of known magic shells in both the daughter and parent nuclei , and the possible new closed - shell daughter products presenting the signatures of a new radioactivity , if any .",
    "the cluster decay calculations are presented separately for each set of nuclei .    figures 2 and 3 show the fragmentation potentials for nd and pb nuclei , as the representatives of the two mass regions ( a=130 - 158 and 180 - 198 ) studied here .",
    "the experimental binding energies used are from the 1995 tables of audi and wapstra @xcite .",
    "we notice that in each case , the potential energy minima occur at @xmath54he and other n = z , @xmath4 nuclei , as well as at n@xmath55z , non-@xmath4 nuclei for all the parents in the heavier mass region ( a=180 - 198 ) and for only the heavier parents in the lighter mass region a=130 - 158 .",
    "this means that the @xmath4-nuclei decay products are energetically more favoured for the lighter isotopes of nd and gd parents in the lighter mass region a=130 - 158 , and the non-@xmath4 decay products become equally favourable for all the hg and pb parents in the heavier mass region a=180 - 198 and for the heavier isotopes of nd and gd parents in a=130 - 158 mass region .",
    "we are interested only in the potential energy minima because the preformation factors p@xmath40 for nuclei at the minima are the largest , compared to their neighbours , as is depicted in fig . 4 for nd and gd and in fig . 5 for hg and pb parents ,",
    "where , for some clusters belonging to the minima in the fragmentation potentials , the ( negative ) logarithm of the preformation probability p@xmath40 is plotted as a function of the mass number of the parents .",
    "we notice that in all cases , like in our earlier calculations @xcite , the preformation factor is largest for @xmath54he and it goes on decreasing as the size of the cluster increases .",
    "another point of interest to note in these figures is the change of clusters for the heavier parents ( see the dashed parts of lines ) .",
    "for example , in both the figs . 4 and 5 , the cluster @xmath56o for @xmath57gd and @xmath58hg nuclei changes to @xmath56c for heavier @xmath59gd and @xmath60hg nuclei .",
    "however , then the q - value ( for @xmath56c cluster combination ) is so small ( see fig .",
    "6 ) that the penetrability is almost negligible ( and hence of not much interest to include such clusters any further in our analysis ) .",
    "figure 6 also reveals that the q - value is negative ( or nearly zero ) for @xmath4-decay of @xmath61gd , and for both the @xmath4 and @xmath8be decays of gd nuclei heavier than @xmath62gd .",
    "the fact that the penetrabilities p are small ( @xmath63 large ) for smaller q - values , is evident from figs . 7 and 8 , which give ,",
    "similar to figs .",
    "4 and 5 , the results of our calculation for the barrier penetrability p. we further notice in fig . 7",
    "that the penetrability p is in general small ( large @xmath63 ) for non-@xmath4 clusters in the light mass region a=130 - 158 .",
    "the combined effect of the preformation probability p@xmath40 and penetrability p gives the measurable decay half - life time t@xmath39 , since the impinging frequency @xmath41 is almost constant .",
    "the resulting t@xmath39 are presented in figs . 9 and 10 , where their logarithms are plotted with respect to the mass number of the parent nuclei .",
    "the structural information obtained from these calculations for each set of parents is discussed separately in the following sub - sections .",
    "note , however , in fig .",
    "9(b ) that @xmath62gd is almost stable against @xmath4 and @xmath8be decays ( large t@xmath39-values ) , but could be of interest for other heavier cluster decays , as is discussed in section iii.b.2 .",
    "we have noted above that the preformation factor p@xmath40 is largest for @xmath54he .",
    "this is of the order of @xmath64 for all superdeformed @xmath65nd , superdeformed and some heavier mass , normal deformed @xmath57gd nuclei ( superdeformation in gd nuclei stops at @xmath66gd , and gd nuclei beyond @xmath62gd are @xmath4-stable , @xmath670 ; q - value is small but positive for @xmath4-decay of @xmath62gd , though experimentally it is a known @xmath4-stable nucleus ) , all superdeformed and some lighter mass ( mainly odd - a ) , normal deformed @xmath68hg ( here superdeformation begins at @xmath22hg ) and all superdeformed @xmath69pb nuclei .",
    "however , p@xmath40 is much larger , @xmath70 , for almost all lighter mass , normal deformed @xmath71hg and @xmath72pb nuclei .",
    "this suggests that superdeformed nuclei are the poorer @xmath4-emitters , as compared to their light mass , normal deformed species .",
    "interesting enough , the same result is born out in the calculated @xmath4-decay half - lives t@xmath73 , plotted in fig .",
    "11 as @xmath74t@xmath73 versus parent mass number , and compared with the available experimental data ( taken from refs .",
    "we have also included here ( see inset , fig .",
    "11 ) the other heavier isotopes of pb in order to include the lone experimetal data for @xmath75pb , in the neighborhood of doubly magic @xmath13pb nucleus . the fig .",
    "11 presents not only the interesting comparison of calculated results with experiments , but also interesting shell structure effects of both the parent nuclei and their daughter products which are mostly known but not yet observed experimentally via @xmath4-decay studies ( the @xmath4-decay experimental data are not yet complete ) .",
    "we have also compared our results and the available experimental data with another calculation due to the generalized liquid drop model ( gldm ) @xcite in table 1 .",
    "we notice that the pcm and the gldm calculations give identical results , both within one order of magnitude of the experimental data .",
    "the following results are evident from fig .",
    "11 : ( i ) the pcm calculations compare nicely with experiments , showing even the ( small ) odd - even effects in both the light mass , normal deformed @xmath71hg and @xmath72pb nuclei .",
    "the odd - even effects seem to become weaker in all the superdeformed and heavier normal deformed nuclei studied here ( see e.g. @xmath76gd or @xmath77hg nuclei ) .",
    "the data are not yet enough to show the odd - even effects as clearly as are given by the calculations .",
    "the comparison between the experimental data and our calculations for all the five @xmath76gd isotopes ( containing no apparent odd - even effects ) and the single @xmath75pb parent in very heavy mass region are also particularly striking .",
    "( ii ) the light mass , normal deformed @xmath71hg and @xmath72pb parents are clearly the better @xmath4 emitters ( smaller @xmath78 values ) , as compared to their heavier and superdeformed counterparts and the superdeformed @xmath65nd and @xmath57gd parents .",
    "this also includes the heavier , normal deformed @xmath79gd nuclei .",
    "however , the superdeformed nuclei are better @xmath4 emitters than the heavier mass , normal deformed nuclei . in other words ,",
    "the superdeformed nuclei are though better @xmath4 emitters than the heavier mass , normal deformed ( heavier than the superdeformed ) nuclei , but both are poorer @xmath4 emitters as compared to the light mass , normal deformed nuclei .",
    "( iii ) the large ( peaking of ) @xmath78-values for @xmath61gd and @xmath80pb parents show the shell closure effects ( strong stability ) of magic n=82 and 126 coupled with their semi - magic z=64 and magic z=82 , respectively .",
    "( iv ) the above noted peaking effect of @xmath78 at the spherical magic shells of the parents could be interpreted as the signature of the change of a shell from the deformed to the spherical one or one can say the presence of a ( spherical or deformed ) closed - shell daughter at the bottom(s ) or valley(s ) of such a peak .",
    "one such result is evident for the minimum ( valley ) at @xmath81gd , which refers clearly to n=82 spherical daughter @xmath82sm for its @xmath4 decay .",
    "a similar minimum at @xmath83nd could be due to the mid - shell effect of magic z=50 and sub - magic z=64 for the ( weakly deformed ) daughter @xmath84ce .",
    "such peaking effects are also visible in the superdeformed hg and pb nuclei . apparently , all these results clearly establish the credentials of pcm for its possible predictions for the heavier - cluster decays and the associated shell structure effects , studied in the following sub - section .",
    "we have seen above , and is also known from our earlier calculations @xcite , that as the n : z ratio of parent nuclei increases , the n@xmath55z , non-@xmath4 nuclei cluster emissions become equally , or even more , probable as compared to n = z , @xmath4 nuclei cluster emissions ( see , e.g. , the crossing over of the curves for @xmath9c and @xmath85c clusters in fig .",
    "4(b ) for heavier gd parents or in fig .",
    "5(a ) for hg parents ; p@xmath40 becomes larger for @xmath85c , as compared to that for @xmath9c ) .",
    "hence , the @xmath4-nucleus cluster emission effects must be more prevalent for parents in the low mass region a=130 - 158 and the non-@xmath4 nuclei cluster emissions for parents in the heavier mass region a=180 - 198 . we know that all the radioactive exotic cluster - decays from the parent masses a@xmath86222 consist of only non-@xmath4 nuclei clusters @xcite , such as @xmath85c , @xmath87o , @xmath88f , @xmath89ne , @xmath90 mg and @xmath91si .",
    "secondly , it is interesting to note that , though the cluster preformation factors p@xmath40 are of similar orders for both the chosen regions of parent nuclei ( compare figs . 4 and 5 ) , the penetrabilities p are much smaller ( larger @xmath92p ) for parents in the lighter mass region a=130 - 158 ( compare figs . 7 and 8) .",
    "this means that , like for @xmath4-decays , the cluster - decay rates for parents in the lighter mass region are also expected to be smaller ( larger cluster - decay half - lives ) than for parents in the heavier mass region .",
    "in other words , the parents in lighter mass region a=130 - 158 are likely to be more stable against cluster decays , than the parents in heavier mass region a=180 - 198 .",
    "we discuss these results in the following for each set of parent nuclei separately .",
    "first of all we look at the calculations in figs .",
    "4(a ) and 7(a ) , respectively , for the preformation probability p@xmath40 and penetrability p for nd parents .",
    "we notice that -log@xmath93p@xmath40 for the lightest two clusters @xmath8be and @xmath9c are structure - less ( remains almost constant ) , but for heavier clusters develop into maxima ( minima for p@xmath40 ) each at the even - a parents @xmath83nd and @xmath94nd which grow as the size of the cluster increases . on the other hand , for the penetrability",
    ", -log@xmath93p is structure - less for all clusters , except for a steep rise for @xmath8be decay and small maximum ( minimum for p ) at @xmath83nd ( or a minimum at @xmath95nd ) for its @xmath85c decay .",
    "the fact that these maxima and minima are simply the result of an odd - even effect in nd nuclei is evident from the almost constant cluster decay half - lives t@xmath96 in fig .",
    "the notable exception is again for @xmath8be decay , where the decay half - life is an ever increasing function of parent mass , with t@xmath9710@xmath14(s ) and hence stable against such a decay .",
    "the interesting result is that some heavy clusters , like @xmath98si , have decay half - lives of the same order as for the light clusters like @xmath9c and @xmath56o .",
    "these are apparently due to , say , the neighbouring z=50 magic shell in @xmath99te daughter , or the mid - shell effects of the known neutron magic shells , in @xmath56o decay of @xmath95nd parent .",
    "the decay half - lives are , however , large @xmath10010@xmath101 ( s ) . in other words ,",
    "the nd parents are as stable , rather more stable , against cluster decays as they are against @xmath4-decays .      for gd parents , the p@xmath40 in fig .",
    "4(b ) seem to behave smoothly , except for a small minimum at @xmath81gd parent , which turn into a minimum at @xmath102gd and a maximum at @xmath81gd parent for the heavier clusters . also , the division between the superdefomed and normal deformed nuclei is evident at @xmath103gd where p@xmath40 increases suddenly ( @xmath92p@xmath40 decreases ) for all the clusters and stays nearly independent of the mass of normal deformed parents ( except for small oscillations , the odd - even effect ) . on the other hand , the p in fig .",
    "7(b ) show the maxima , minima structure for different light clusters at any one of the parent nuclei @xmath104gd .",
    "the heavier clusters are all peaked around @xmath61gd .",
    "these results combine to give four significant minima for t@xmath96 in fig .",
    "9(b ) : one at @xmath66gd for @xmath8be decay , another at @xmath103gd for @xmath9c decay , the third one at @xmath62gd for @xmath85c decay and finally the fourth one at @xmath105gd for @xmath106o decay .",
    "all these minima refer to n=82 magicity of the respective daughters @xmath107nd , @xmath108ce , @xmath108ce and @xmath109ba . in other words , these are the only four isotopes of gd ( @xmath110gd ) which are prone to heavier cluster decays , though the predicted decay half - lives are large @xmath10010@xmath111 - 10@xmath112(s ) .",
    "note that one of these parents ( @xmath66gd ) is a superdeformed nucleus whereas the other three heavier ones ( @xmath113gd ) are normal deformed nuclei .",
    "also , of these four , @xmath8be and @xmath9c decays of @xmath66gd and @xmath103gd , recpectively , are more probable ( smaller t@xmath96 )",
    ". then , there are some maxima appearing in fig .",
    "9(b ) , mainly at @xmath61gd , which refer to the stability of this parent nucleus against the cluster decays due to its n=82 shell closure .",
    "note that @xmath61gd is already stable against @xmath8be decay ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "thus , the structure effects of both the parent(s ) and daughters come into play in the cluster - decay properties of gd nuclei , but the predicted cluster decay half - lives are beyond the limits of the present measurements , which go only upto @xmath10010@xmath115(s ) @xcite .      in this sub - section",
    ", we discuss the results of our calculations for normal deformed @xmath71hg and superdeformed @xmath77hg nuclei , presented in figs .",
    "5(a ) , 8(a ) and 10(a ) for p@xmath40 , p and t@xmath96 , respectively .",
    "first of all , we notice a number of minima and maxima in fig .",
    "5(a ) for p@xmath40 , which correspond to the odd - even effects of the parents",
    ". then , the p@xmath40 increases suddenly ( @xmath92p@xmath40 decreases ) near the transition point of deformed to superdeformed region where it has the largest value for almost all the cluster preformations in @xmath116hg , the normal deformed nucleus at the transition .",
    "as we shall see below for the t@xmath96 calculations , this result corresponds exactly to the one observed for the @xmath4-decay half - lives of gd isotopes in fig .",
    "11 , i.e. of the change of shape in going from a maximum ( peaking ) to the minimum ( valley ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the p are nearly smooth functions of the parent mass , except for a noticeable minimum ( enhanced penetrability ) at @xmath117hg , and/or for some clusters at @xmath22hg , in fig .",
    "the resulting t@xmath96 in fig .",
    "10(a ) show interesting maxima and minima , like for p@xmath40 , for normal deformed @xmath118hg nuclei , referring to the larger stability of the even parents ( at maxima ) relative to the odd parents ( at minima ) .",
    "then , a ( broad ) minimum or valley of instability ( smaller values next to a maximum in t@xmath96 ) occurs for the normal deformed and superdeformed transitional nuclei @xmath6hg .",
    "the above noted stability of even - a @xmath118hg nuclei point to the closed shell effects of these parents at z=80 ( in the neighborhood of magic z=82 ) coupled with a magic or semi - magic nature of their neutron shells with n=96,98,100,102 and 104 . on the other hand ,",
    "the instabilty of @xmath6hg parents , against various clusters , reflect the closed shell effects of the daughter nuclei , like @xmath119os , @xmath120w , .. , etc . , referring to z=76,74 , .. and n=106,104,102 , .. closed or near - closed shells . coupling the results of both the stability and instability in this region , with the fact that @xmath8be and @xmath9c are shown as the most probable cluster decays ( smallest t@xmath96-values ) , the z=76 or 74 and n=96 - 104 seem to point to the major ( deformed ) closed shells .",

    "the net result is a shallow minimum in t@xmath96 for heavier clusters , like @xmath126o and @xmath127ne , from @xmath60pb or @xmath125pb parents , which means the shell stabilizing effects of the daughters @xmath128w and @xmath129hf .",

    "specifically , the @xmath65nd , @xmath131gd , @xmath132hg and @xmath69pb nuclei are studied , which also include the normal deformed nuclei on both the lighter and heavier sides of the superdeformed nuclei .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath4-decay of pb nuclei , we have also considered the very heavy isotopes upto @xmath75pb which means including also the spherical closed shell effects of @xmath13pb with doubly magic z=82 and n=126 .",
    "the main idea of this work is to look for new ( spherical or deformed ) closed shells via cluster decay studies or , in other words , the possible signatures of any new cluster radioactivity in the superdeformed nuclei .",
    "a parent nucleus is stable against @xmath4 and other cluster - decays , if the decay half - lives are large . on the other hand",
    "if the decay half - life is small ( measurable or close to measurable ) then , in view of the so - far observed radioactive decays , it must refer to the closed shell effects of the daughter product(s ) .",
    "based on such an analysis for both the @xmath4 and heavier cluster decays , we have obtained the following results from the chosen nuclear mass regions .",
    "the superdeformed nuclei are better @xmath4 emitters , as compared to their heavier mass , normal deformed isotopes , though both of these are poorer @xmath4 emitters than their lighter mass , normal deformed species .",
    "the closed shell effects of the parents ( for @xmath61gd and @xmath13pb parents ) , at the spherical sub - magic z=64 , magic n=82 and doubly magic z=82 , n=126 , are evident in terms of the maxima or peaking of the @xmath4-decay half - lives , whereas the same for daughter nuclei @xmath133ce and @xmath134sm ( for @xmath83nd and @xmath81gd parents , respectively ) are given as minima or valleys in @xmath4-decay half - lives due to the mid - shell effect of the magic z=50 and sub - magic z=64 , and the n=82 magic shell .",
    "these are the known shell closure effects , which apparently are nicely reproduced in the pcm calculations .",
    "the calculated cluster - decay half - lives show that the lighter mass region a=130 - 158 is more stable ( larger t@xmath96 values ) than the heavier mass region a=180 - 198 .",
    "the light mass region presents the closed shell effects of known magic z=50 or n=82 shells ( for @xmath56o decay of @xmath95nd , @xmath8be decay of @xmath66gd , @xmath135c decays of @xmath136gd , respectively , and @xmath106o decay of @xmath105gd ) , with the predicted cluster decay half - lives beyond the present measurable limits of the experiments(t@xmath13710@xmath111(s ) or more ) . on the other hand , the heavier mass region a=180 - 198 present not only the stability effects of neighbouring z=82 magic shell for even - a @xmath118hg parents , but also interesting new possibilities of deformed - daughter cluster radioactivity at z=72 - 76 and n=96 - 104 for @xmath6hg and @xmath7pb .",
    "in other words , new deformed magic shells are likely to occur at z=72 - 76 and n=96 - 104 for various cluster decays of @xmath6hg and @xmath7pb .",
    "the best , observable cases are predicted to be @xmath8be and @xmath9c decays of @xmath10hg and/or @xmath11pb parents ( with t@xmath13710@xmath106 and 10@xmath88 ( s ) , respectively ) .",
    "the interesting point is that in both the nuclear regions under study , more of these nuclei are normal deformed nuclei rather than superdeformed ones .",
    "in fact , they lie at the transition between the normal deformation and superdeformation , but more towards the region of normal deformation .",
    "the best possible cases also come from the normal deformed regions . in other words",
    ", the region of the change of shape , i.e. the valley(s ) in the immediate neighbourhood of a peak , seems to be the criterion for the location of new magicities or for the new cluster radioactivity(ies ) .",
