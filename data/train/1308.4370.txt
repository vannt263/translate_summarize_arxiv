    "a gravitational perturber moving through a gaseous background creates a density wake in the medium .",

    "the gravitating object induces small disturbances in the far - field ambient medium ( i.e. in streamlines with large impact parameters ) and , consequently , the far - field density structure of the wake can be derived in linear perturbation theory ( dokuchaev 1964 ; ruderman & spiegel 1971 ) . using this approach ,",
    "ostriker ( 1999 ) derived the density wake behind a gravitational body of mass @xmath0 moving at velocity @xmath2 on a straight - line trajectory through a homogeneous infinite medium with unperturbed density @xmath15 and sound speed @xmath16 , when the perturber is dropped at @xmath17 . for subsonic perturbers",
    ", the isodensity contours are closed ellipsoids , which do not contribute to the drag force , except in the outer parts of the wake where the ellipsoids are not closed .",
    "supersonic perturbers generate a density wake only within the rear mach cone .    here",
    ", we are interested in the dynamical friction , that is , the drag force onto the perturber due to the gravitational interaction with its own induced wake .",
    "thus , once the density of the wake is known , the drag force @xmath18 can be computed as the gravitational force between the perturber and its wake .",
    "the drag force is usually written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the coulomb logarithm .",
    "for subsonic perturbers , i.e. @xmath21 , ostriker ( 1999 ) found that , at times satisfying @xmath22 , the coulomb logarithm is @xmath23 where @xmath5 is the minimum radius of the effective gravitational interaction of a perturber with the gas . in practice , for a point mass object , @xmath5 is taken as the radius at which the linear approximation breaks down . for supersonic perturbers ,",
    "the coulomb logarithm is given by @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( ostriker 1999 ) .",
    "snchez - salcedo & brandenburg ( 1999 ) tested numerically ostriker s formula when the perturber is extended .",
    "this could represent a globular cluster orbiting in the gaseous halo of its host galaxy , a young massive star cluster in a merging system , an elliptical galaxy depleted of gas in the intracluster medium , or a galaxy cluster in a major merger environment ( e.g. , naiman et al .",
    "snchez - salcedo & brandenburg ( 1999 ) found that ostriker s formula describes successfully the temporal evolution and magnitude of the force experienced by a plummer perturber , when its mass @xmath0 is small enough so that the gas response to the perturbation is linear .",
    "for supersonic perturbers , they inferred @xmath27 , where @xmath1 is the core radius .",
    "kim & kim ( 2009 , hereafter kk09 ) carried out axisymmetric numerical simulations to study the flow past a plummer sphere in the linear and in the nonlinear regimes .",
    "for the linear supersonic regime , they found that the minimum radius in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ostriker2 ] ) depends slightly on the mach number : @xmath28 . moreover , they found in their simulations that the drag force is highly suppressed in the nonlinear regime as compared to the linear case .    in this paper ,",
    "we revisit the drag force on an extended ( non - accreting ) gravitating object with a range of velocities relative to the ambient medium .",
    "our aim is to provide a physically more motivated and more accurate formula for the drag force in both the linear and nonlinear cases . in section [ sec : radius ] , we briefly recapitulate the relevant scales in the problem , discuss the ambiguity in the definition of the minimum radius and describe the numerical code adopted in this paper .",

    "consider the flow pattern past a gravitational object .",
    "the inner structure of the wake ( in the vicinity of the object ) depends on the adopted equation of state for the gas ( e.g. , @xmath29 , if the gas behaves as a polytrope , @xmath30 ) and depends also on whether the perturber is a point mass gravitational potential or a non - point mass distribution ( e.g. , naiman et al .",
    "2011 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the drag force may depend on @xmath29 and on the adopted inner conditions .",
    "for instance , lee & stahler ( 2011 ) found that , for subsonic perturbers with @xmath31 , the drag force felt by a point mass ( accretor ) is higher than what ostriker s formula predicts for extended non - accretors . for hypersonic perturbers , however , cant et al .",

    "one expects that the minimum radius @xmath5 in equation ( [ eq : ostriker2 ] ) may be expressed as a certain combination of the three characteristic radii .",
    "the linear analysis is expected to provide a good estimate of the drag force in circumstances where the depth of the external gravitational potential @xmath41 is small as compared to @xmath42 , so that the disturbances are small at any location .",
    "therefore , the linear analysis is tacitly assuming that the gravitational potential is non - divergent .",
    "for an extended perturber with softening radius @xmath1 , the perturbation is linear at any location if the parameter @xmath43 .",
    "in this situation , the only relevant characteristic radius is @xmath1 and , hence , one expects a relationship between @xmath5 and @xmath1 : @xmath44 . in this case , the response of the fluid is linear at any position and , therefore , the drag force is expected to vary with @xmath45 according to equations ( [ eq : rephaeli])-([eq : ostriker2 ] ) . in other words , @xmath46 is expected to depend very weakly on the mach number in order to preserve the functional dependence with @xmath45 .",

    "i.e. when the perturber has travelled a distance of @xmath99 , the drag force using @xmath97 is twice the drag force when a @xmath5-value of @xmath100 is used instead .",
    "since the drag force in the linear regime is used as the reference value , it is important to have a robust determination of @xmath5 .",

    "the maximum of the mass density in the wake created by a core ( non - diverging ) potential is not situated at the minimum of the gravitational potential but it is placed behind it . in the linear regime , the minimum radius @xmath5 can not be much larger than a few softening radii because beyond those distances from the perturber , the wake density is almost undistinguishable from the wake created by a point mass . in particular , for the plummer sphere with core radius @xmath1 , we confirm our previous result that the minimum radius for the drag force is @xmath185 .",
    "thus , @xmath5 is fairly independent of the mach number .",
    "we must emphasize that in the linear regime , the dependence on the particular radiative cooling and heating of the gas is through the sound speed @xmath16 .",
    "if we keep @xmath3 fixed and reduce @xmath1 , we have models with higher @xmath12 and , hence , the gas dynamics around the body becomes nonlinear .",
    "when @xmath49 ( i.e. @xmath50 ) , the radius @xmath1 becomes irrelevant as far as the drag force is concerned .",
    "thus , the minimum radius @xmath5 must be related with the bondi scale and/or the `` accretion '' radius .",
    "using axisymmetrical simulations , we found that the drag force can be described well by using ostriker ( 1999 ) formula with @xmath7 for perturbers with @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "however , at @xmath11 , the drag force can be equally explained using @xmath188 or @xmath189 .",
    "the latter possibilities imply that @xmath183 at the hypersonic limit , which resembles the scaling found for a point - mass ( accreting ) perturber by cant et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .    at large enough times",
    ", the wake can be decomposed into the nonlinear part , which has reached a quasi - stationary state and a growing far - field wake .",
    "our working formula for the drag force naturally includes the fact that at times @xmath190 , the material that is being incorporated into the wake has large impact parameters and thus can be described using the linear theory , implying that @xmath158 . on the contrary , the formula proposed by kk09 , @xmath160 , does not match this condition , meaning that this relationship between @xmath18 and @xmath148 should break down at a certain @xmath191 .",
    "we tested kk09 formula and found that it underestimates the drag force , especially at large times ( long wakes ) .",
    "applied to a perturber in orbit , kk09 argue that since @xmath192 , then the orbital decay timescale of a cored perturber declines as @xmath193 ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "our formula has the classical dependence @xmath194 , where the dependence of @xmath20 on @xmath0 is very weak .",
    "thus , perturbers with an initial orbital radii much larger than @xmath3 decay in a characteristic timescale @xmath195 .",
    "we are grateful to dgtic - unam for allowing us to use its kanbalam and miztli clusters , where all the simulations were performed .",
    "some preliminary simulations were carried out using atocatl at ia - unam .",
