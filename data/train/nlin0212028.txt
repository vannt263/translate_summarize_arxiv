    "nematic liquid crystals , the simplest type of intrinsically anisotropic fluids , continue to provide model systems for a wide variety of interesting nonlinear dynamical phenomena like optical instabilities @xcite , flow - induced nonlinear waves @xcite , critical properties of nonequilibrium transitions @xcite , and in particular electrically or thermally driven convection instabilities @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .    in nematics the mean orientation of the rod - like molecules is described by the director @xmath0 .",
    "electroconvection ( ec ) driven by an ac voltage @xmath1 at frequency @xmath2 is commonly observed in thin nematic layers sandwiched between glass plates with transparent electrodes using nematics with positive conductivity anisotropy ( @xmath3 ) and negative or slightly positive dielectric anisotropy @xmath4 . in the",
    "well studied _ planarly _ aligned case , where @xmath0 is anchored parallel to the bounding plates along a direction which we will take as @xmath5 ( we choose the layer in the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane ) ec sets in directly from the homogeneous state at a critical voltage @xmath7 and leads slightly above threshold to ordered roll patterns associated with a periodic director distortion with the critical wave vector @xmath8 . here",
    "we will only consider the most common situation where the bifurcation is supercritical and leads to stationary rolls with @xmath9 parallel to @xmath10 ( normal rolls ( nrs ) ) . in the usual low - frequency conduction regime , where the wavelength is controlled by the cell thickness",
    ", this may exclude in particular very low frequencies where the rolls at threshold may be oriented obliquely ( depending on the material ) . in nrs near threshold",
    "the director remains in the @xmath5-@xmath11 plane , i.e. , perpendicular to the roll axis .",
    "the investigation of homeotropically oriented cells using nematics with manifestly negative dielectric anisotropy @xmath12 was initiated rather recently , see @xcite for experimental and @xcite for theoretical work . in this case",
    "the director is initially oriented perpendicular to the layer , i.e. , in the @xmath11 direction , so the system is isotropic in the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane .",
    "then the first instability is the spatially homogeneous freedericksz transition where the director bends away from the @xmath11 direction , singling out spontaneously a direction @xmath13 in the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane .",
    "after the transition the slow , undamped variation of the in - plane director @xmath13 ( the goldstone mode ) may be described by an angle @xmath14 . at higher voltages",
    "there is a further transition to ec which is in many respects similar to that in cells with planarly aligned nematics .",
    "however , now the goldstone mode has to be included in the description even right at threshold .",
    "it turns out that the torque arising when the in - plane director and the wavevector are ( slightly ) misaligned is destabilizing , i.e. , it acts to increase the misalignment ( `` abnormal torque '' ) .",
    "then the in - plane director in nrs is not perpendicular to the ( local ) roll axis .",
    "these nrs with a misaligned in - plane director were termed `` abnormal rolls '' ( ars ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore one may expect spatio - temporal disorder right at threshold and this has indeed been observed , at least in the oblique roll regime , where one expects faster dynamics @xcite . for nrs the experimental situation is not totally clear @xcite .    by applying an in - plane magnetic field , which now defines the @xmath5 direction and exerts an aligning torque on @xmath13 , the disorder at threshold can be suppressed .",
    "indeed the situation then is similar to that in the planar case .",
    "however , for a small field a small abnormal torque will suffice to overcome the magnetic alignment , and then one has a transition to ordered ars , where the in - plane director is homogeneously rotated out of the @xmath5 direction . for nrs",
    "this symmetry breaking is spontaneous , either to the left or to the right , and the transition is described by a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation , which has been verified experimentally @xcite .    in the planarly aligned case one also has a transition to ordered ars , although this occurs at a distance from threshold such that a quantitative description is more difficult .",
    "since now the director is aligned at the cell boundaries the distortion of the in - plane director is confined to the center part of the cell leading to a twist distortion . incidentally ,",
    "this is the reason why the phenomenon has been identified only recently in planar convection @xcite . by applying a magnetic field in the @xmath6 direction",
    "one can now destabilize @xmath13 and thus move the ar transition downward towards the primary instability .",
    "the ar transition merges with the primary bifurcation when the field reaches the strength of the twist freedericksz field .",
    "when the two transitions are near each other a simple reduced description can be used .",
    "this shows that the two classes of systems are in many ways similar .    above the ar transition one",
    "often observes more complicated structures with or without defects .",
    "in particular , in homeotropic ec , modulations of the ar mode have been observed which leave the roll pattern ( i.e. , its phase ) virtually unchanged @xcite .",
    "ideally , such structures can be considered quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) with spatial variations only perpendicular to the ( normally oriented ) rolls .",
    "we wish to address in particular such structures by studying the simplest set of coupled amplitude equations capable of describing the ar scenario .",
    "these equations were first derived for homeotropic systems near threshold @xcite but with a slight generalization they can also illustrate the planar case .",
    "we here present for the first time 1d solutions of the appropriate type .",
    "we will then briefly discuss the destabilization of these 1d structures .",
    "finally we present a new class of fully ordered 2d solutions occurring at higher voltage ( or smaller magnetic fields ) involving periodic arrangements of defect chains ( or bands of defects ) .",
    "we call them static chevrons since they are reminiscent of the dynamic chevrons observed in the dielectric range of ec , and more recently , also in homeotropic convection @xcite",
    ".    our results could also be of relevance for the higher - frequency dielectric regime , where the rolls are very narrow and therefore the orienting effect of planar boundary conditions is substantially weaker than in the conduction range .",
    "recently the weakly nonlinear description of the dielectric regime in planarly aligned systems has been investigated in detail @xcite .    in sec .",

    "we start by discussing domain walls that connect the two variants of ar solutions and their interaction . near the ar transition ( @xmath35 near 1 ) domain walls attract each other , so that modulated states are unstable .",

    "( [ eq : a ] ) leading to @xmath71 in this equation all modulated states ( they can be expressed in terms of an elliptic integral ) are unstable , although their lifetimes are exceedingly long due to the exponentially weak ( attractive ) interaction between well separated domain walls ( see below ) .",

    "the walls can connect only to the ar states and @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) for @xmath72 , this limit has to be clarified .",

    "[ fig : wall ] .",
    "the fields go to their ar values at spatial infinity .",
    "however , in the wall region the field @xmath14 exhibits an overshoot approaching the values @xmath80 of ( [ eq : front ] ) .",
    "the overshoot becomes longer and approaches nearer to @xmath80 as @xmath81 .    in order to understand this behavior better we study the spatial decay of the solution into the ar state",

    "they are @xmath82 for @xmath72 the exponents are complex and tend to zero , which explains the slow decay .",

    "the problem is formulated as follows : two walls are placed symmetrically around the origin at positions @xmath86 .",

    "we now focus on the region @xmath88 , write the amplitude and angle as @xmath89 and substitute these expressions into eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a],[eq : phi ] ) . in the spirit of small variations _ and _ slow ( `` slaved '' ) dynamics we keep the terms linear in @xmath90 and @xmath15 , but neglect the ones that are small and contain time derivatives @xmath91 where the dot denotes time derivatives and the argument of all functions is @xmath92 .    to satisfy the boundary conditions one needs @xmath93 and @xmath94 at @xmath87 .",
    "at the other end @xmath95 the perturbations @xmath90 and @xmath15 should vanish . multiplying ( [ eq : perturbed ] ) by the adjoint of the translational mode @xmath96 and integrating from zero to infinity , we obtain an equation which has on the right hand side only the boundary terms at @xmath87 . on the left hand side",
    "the integrals may be extended to @xmath97 with negligible error leading to @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",

    "@xmath83 , i.e. , for @xmath105 , the interaction is repulsive or attractive depending on the distance between walls .",

    "in general , the 2d modulated states reached slightly below the destabilization of 1d periodic modulations are delicate and we have not been able to find a truly static one .",
    "the near - periodicity of the final states in both spatial directions is readily seen in the figures resulting from our simulations .",
    "an interesting point is that the defects which are typically created in these processes also show strong 2d correlations .",
    "in fact a slightly disordered defect lattice is the usual outcome of such numerical simulations .",
    "an example of a reasonably developed defect lattice is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : latticea ] through the field @xmath149 .",

    "we used the value @xmath151 and the other parameters as in ( [ eq : paramvalues ] ) .",
    "the initial 1d periodic state is then unstable and evolves into the defect lattice .",
    "the time evolution shows that the state has some substantial dynamics but it always remains close to the picture of fig .",
    "[ fig : latticea ] . finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : latticephi ] we give the @xmath14 field of the defect lattice of fig .",
    "[ fig : latticea ] .",
    "the @xmath14 field is predominantly varying in the @xmath5 direction with small modulations in @xmath6 .",
    "on further reducing the parameter @xmath35 the resulting pattern becomes progressively more disordered . a defect chaotic state is eventually obtained for small values of the parameter . in fig .",
    "[ fig : chaotic ] we show such a state for @xmath106 .",
    "these defect - chaotic states deserve to be studied on their own right but a full investigation of this problem is beyond the scopes of the present paper .",
    "it is not easy to predict in what way the states that we study here would appear in an experiment .",
    "details of the experimental procedure could be important and the final result can be complicated as is indicated , e.g. , by fig .  7 in @xcite where roughly periodic states without defects are found . in order to observe defect lattices in homeotropic cells",
    "one should remain at small values of @xmath30 so that the director angle does not become very large .",
    "otherwise a transition to crazy rolls occurs first , which entails formation of disclinations in the director field @xcite .",
    "also , at higher values of @xmath30 , mean - flow effects not included in our simple description become important .",
    "let us describe the protocol of a numerical simulation which may give some guidance for experiments .",
    "the simulations are performed on a @xmath147 domain .",
    "we start at a field @xmath35 above @xmath131 ( @xmath152 ) with small spatially random initial conditions of the fields @xmath153 .",
    "experimentally this corresponds to jumping from below the ec threshold directly into the region of stable ars .",
    "typically , large domains with both ar states appear , separated by walls in the @xmath5 direction .",
    "we then jump to @xmath145 where ars are destabilized while defects are created and a state with 2d correlations sets in .",
    "the final state is roughly periodic with period 12.8 in the @xmath5 direction ( 5 periods in the domain ) and 16 in the @xmath6 direction ( 4 periods in the domain ) .",
    "the defects are also roughly ordered in a lattice .",
    "after this we increase @xmath35 gradually in steps of @xmath154 and let the system relax in every step for 1000 time units .",
    "although the system never relaxes to a static state , we observe clearly correlations in both spatial directions with the defects approximately ordered in arrays until @xmath155 is reached . for @xmath156",
    "the defects annihilate and the system relaxes to a static 1d periodic state with period 12.8 .",
    "the process described above seems robust in our simulations .",
    "note the interesting fact that there is a range of stable coexistence of the fully ordered 1d state ( it is stable down to @xmath157 ) and the 2d solution .",
    "defect lattices have in fact been observed in planar ec @xcite at fairly high frequencies .",
    "a theoretical description for these systems by a much more elaborate quantitative theory has been developed recently @xcite .",
    "here we will relax the condition @xmath125 by reducing @xmath126 ( slightly ) below @xmath127 .",
    "this has no influence on the 1d solutions and their stability with respect to @xmath5 dependent fluctuations and increases the range of stability with respect to @xmath6 variations .",
    "in fact the critical value of @xmath35 for the zig - zag destabilization of the periodic solutions ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : limits ] ) is reduced .",
    "for example , the period 9.14 is stable in the range @xmath158 which should be compared to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pstability ] ) . for values of @xmath35 beyond the instability the states that we obtain are similar to the ones found above for @xmath159 .",
    "namely , we observe states with 2d order close to the instability point ( with some hysteresis ) , which get progressively less ordered as @xmath35 is decreased .",
    "when @xmath126 is decreased further the stable range of the periodic solutions extends to progressively lower values of @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath160 the 1d solutions with period 9.14 are stable down to @xmath66 .    for @xmath66",
    "we obtain a novel static pattern containing lines ( or bands , i.e. , multiple lines ) of defects along the @xmath6 direction which resemble the usual chevron states , except that those are dynamic . in figs .  [",
    "fig : chevrona ] and [ fig : chevronphi ] such a solution is presented for @xmath161 .",
    "the defects ( zeros of @xmath149 ) are located at the dark points in fig .",
    "[ fig : chevrona ] . within one band",
    "all defects have the same topological charge and this is alternating from band to band .",
    "the dark regions between defect bands imply a small value of @xmath149 .",
    "as one sees from fig .",
    "[ fig : chevronphi ] the field @xmath14 varies periodically essentially only in @xmath5 , and thus is very reminiscent of the 1d patterns discussed before .",
    "we call these new patterns `` static chevrons '' .",
    "they are formed from random initial conditions .",
    "the static chevrons persist for small nonzero values of the parameter @xmath35 .",
    "if we let the chevron states be created for @xmath64 and then increase @xmath35 the static chevrons persist up to @xmath162 for the parameters used here . increasing @xmath35",
    "further ( @xmath163 ) we observe that more defect bands are created , that is , we have chevrons with a shorter period , but these are now the dynamic chevrons presented previously for @xmath159 @xcite . for even larger values of @xmath35",
    "one reaches the much less correlated defect chaotic state discussed before . for @xmath126",
    "closer to @xmath127 the correlations become weaker .    to gain an understanding of static chevrons we first note that the states between the defect bands should be interpreted as ( approximately ) homogeneous states with nonzero wavenumber @xmath164 in the @xmath6 direction , i.e. , with complex amplitude @xmath165 where the sign in the exponent alternates between neighboring regions and the magnitude of @xmath164 is related to the number of defects @xmath166 per unit length in one band through the relation @xmath167 this follows directly from the fact that each defect contributes a phase change of @xmath168 , depending on its topological charge . in the simulations we find that @xmath14 and @xmath164 take values close to @xmath169 in the region between the defect bands while @xmath46 is small as was already mentioned .",
    "the uniform solutions are described by equating the right - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:0d ] ) to zero .",
    "the resulting cubic equation for @xmath47 can be written as @xmath170 ( \\phi_0- c_2 p )        + h\\ , c_2 ^ 2\\ , \\phi_0 = 0 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath72 one of the solutions tends to @xmath171 and the other two tend to @xmath172 here one has to impose the additional restriction that @xmath173 , since otherwise @xmath174 is not positive for @xmath35 slightly away from zero . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phip ] @xmath14 is sketched for these limiting solutions as a function of @xmath164 ( solid lines ) .",
    "the solution ( [ eq : phic2p ] ) is the continuation of the nrs to nonzero @xmath164 .",
    "similarly , ( [ eq : arp ] ) represents the continuation of ars .",
    "the two lines join at point b in fig .",
    "[ fig : phip ] .",
    "we can now see that the states between the defect bands given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : betweenchevrons ] ) correspond ( approximately ) to the continued ars of eq .",
    "( [ eq : arp ] ) with the _ maximal _ @xmath175 .",
    "thus the defect bands connect between the two symmetry degenerate versions of this state .",
    "a simple stability analysis explains why this state is selected .",
    "we write @xmath176 and @xmath177 and linearize eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a2d.scaled],[eq : phi2d.scaled ] ) in @xmath178 . for @xmath179",
    "the two equations separate and we obtain the following expression for the growth rate of the mode involving @xmath90 @xmath180 one easily checks that all states are unstable against fluctuations along @xmath6 except for the state ( [ eq : betweenchevrons ] ) , which is marginally stable .",
    "the latter is denoted by the letter a in fig .",
    "[ fig : phip ] .",
    "the static chevron states which are periodic and describe spatial oscillations between the states ( [ eq : betweenchevrons ] ) need not be themselves marginally stable . on the contrary , they are numerically found to be quite robust .",
    "this observation is in agreement with the results of sec .",
    "[ stability ] that the 1d periodic states are stable even for parameter values for which the uniform states are unstable .",
    "the effect of the value of @xmath126 on the chevron states is rather profound .",
    "this is seen by the ( approximate ) relation giving the density of defects in the chevrons which can be found using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : defdensity ] ) and ( [ eq : betweenchevrons ] ) : @xmath181 thus , as @xmath126 approaches @xmath127 the defect bands become broader ( the separation between defects inside a band is rather independent of parameters ) . in the limit @xmath182 one",
    "expects existence of an infinite lattice of defects with the same polarity , but this is not accessible numerically , and presumably also not experimentally . on the other hand , as @xmath126 decreases , the number of defects per unit length decreases quickly reaching a situation with a single chain in a band .",
    "decreasing @xmath126 further one reaches a critical value below which no defects are created .",
    "instead one has the 1d periodic modulations without defects which are here stable also for @xmath60 ( see above ) .",
    "we have mentioned already that static chevrons persist to slightly nonzero @xmath35 . in order to understand the defect - free regions for this case",
    "we have studied the homogeneous solutions as obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : arp ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phip ] we also show @xmath47 for the case @xmath183 ( dashed ) . analyzing the stability we found that there is a small interval around the states with maximal @xmath175 which are stable .",
    "this shows that the disappearance of static chevrons for increasing @xmath35 is not a result of the homogeneous regions becoming unstable , but rather the defect bands destabilize , which is also observed in simulations .",
    "motivated in particular by experiments in electroconvection in homeotropically aligned nematics @xcite we have studied some classes of modulated solutions of the ginzburg - landau equation for the complex order parameter @xmath16 describing the bifurcation to a stationary roll pattern , coupled to a weakly damped ( or even undamped ) homogeneous mode @xmath14 describing the orientation of the in - plane director , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a2d.unscaled],[eq : phi2d.unscaled ] ) ( unscaled ) or eqs .  ( [ eq : a2d.scaled],[eq : phi2d.scaled ] ) ( scaled ) . the most important parameter @xmath35 in these equations",
    "gives the ratio of the aligning torque on the director over the destabilizing torque of normal rolls .",
    "the latter is proportional to the supercriticality parameter @xmath30 .",
    "another important parameter @xmath39 in the equations characterizes the action of the gradient of the in - plane director on the phase of the rolls , which can be controlled experimentally by varying the frequency .",
    "our study is relevant for @xmath40 , which is the case in the upper - frequency conduction range and presumably also in the dielectric range @xcite .",
    "the solutions we considered are characterized by modulations in the direction perpendicular to normal rolls ( parallel to the wave vector ) .",
    "there exists a surprisingly rich spectrum of stable solutions of this type even in the range of control parameter where most homogeneous states have lost stability .",
    "the simplest type has only variations in the direction of the wavevector ( 1d structures ) .",
    "when such variations arise they lead to the creation of defects , except in a small control parameter region where 2d defect - free modulations may exist metastably .",
    "the solutions with defects range from essentially fully spatially ordered defect lattices to defect chaos with various degrees of spatial correlations .",
    "their detailed study appears interesting , but is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the complexity of the solutions , as well as their dynamics , generally increase with decreasing @xmath35 .",
    "for very small values of @xmath35 , however , defects show the tendency to order along chains ( or bands ) yielding chevron structures .",
    "one mechanism for the generation of dynamic chevrons has been related to a turing instability @xcite .",
    "we have found for @xmath184 a new type of fully ordered , static chevrons that appear more related to the 1d structures .",
    "focusing on the in - plane (= @xmath185 ) director field , the modulations occur along the direction of prealignment of the in - plane director ( from this point of view they give rise to `` bend '' distortions ) .",
    "in fact , there is a long history of observations of such modulated states under an electric field in highly - doped mbba @xcite and other nematic materials @xcite at high frequency , often without detectable convection rolls .",
    "they come under the name of `` wide domains '' @xcite or `` prechevrons '' @xcite .",
    "since such structures can not be explained purely statically , it seems reasonable to assume that they are secondary structures of the type discussed here .",
    "the mechanism for the generation of the primary roll pattern , which may not be visible , is presumably different from the usual carr - helfrich mechanism .",
    "in fact , it was shown that the driving mechanism persisted above the nematic - isotropic transition @xcite . moreover , in @xcite it was shown that a treatment of the bounding plates by tensides led to a considerable increase of the frequency range where the wide domains appeared . these findings , which are consistent with some old results @xcite , indicate that an isotropic mechanism with rolls confined to the boundaries is involved .",
    "it was found that even after the wide domains have formed the usual electroconvection would set in at the expected threshold @xcite . in the dielectric regime",
    "this would lead directly to perfectly ordered chevrons that have an appearance like the static chevrons presented above .    while states modulated only along the direction of the wavevector have been observed to some extent ,",
    "the observation of corresponding two - dimensional modulations without defects is lacking .",
    "this may be due to the small parameter range where such 2d modulations occur and also because of their apparent metastability .",
    "an experimental effort in this direction appears interesting .",
    "the present results suggest that the objective should be to observe successively the 1d and 2d modulations and the chevron states and to test if they can be related to each other according to the present theory .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : a2d.scaled],[eq : phi2d.scaled ] ) also allow for solutions which are modulated only along the rolls ( perpendicular to the prealignment of the in - plane director , giving rise to a `` splay '' distortion ) .",
    "then the phase of the patterning mode ( i.e. , the phase of @xmath16 ) comes into play , and the periodic solutions in fact correspond to zig - zag patterns .",
    "such states are of relevance for smaller values of @xmath39 , in particular for @xmath41 . near the zig - zag instability of normal rolls , which occurs at @xmath186 , and",
    "thus precedes the transition to abnormal rolls for @xmath41 , the periodic patterns are unstable . for smaller values of @xmath35 ( larger @xmath30 )",
    "there are various types of periodic patterns .",
    "the scenario is enriched by the fact that the usual defects ( point dislocations ) can extend in the direction perpendicular to the rolls to form phase slip lines @xcite .    in order to extend the treatment to larger @xmath30",
    "one has to use more complicated equations derivable from an extended nonlinear analysis , which includes in particular mean flow . for planar convection in the conduction regime",
    "the analysis has been carried out and relevant solutions involving in particular realistic defect lattices have been studied @xcite . for the dielectric regime",
    "an extended weakly nonlinear study was presented in @xcite .",
    "the system appears interesting in view of its parameters @xmath187 calculated under neglect of flexoelectric effects , which are of more relevance in the dielectric regime ( note that in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath188 correspond to our @xmath189 ) .",
    "there is hope to find static chevrons if the aligning torque could be made sufficiently small by applying a destabilizing magnetic field .",
    "one might use this technique also in the conduction range where @xmath126 is substantially smaller than @xmath127 @xcite .",
