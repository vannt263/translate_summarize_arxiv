    "one of the classical problems in discrete geometry , raised by p. erds in 1946 @xcite , is the following : given @xmath2 points in the plane , how many unit distances they may determine ?",
    "the key definition related to the question of p. erds is that of a _ unit distance graph_. a graph @xmath1 is a _ unit distance graph _ in @xmath0 if its set of vertices is a finite subset of @xmath0 and the edges are formed by the pairs of vertices which are at unit distance apart . in terms of distance graphs the question is to determine the maximal number of edges in a planar unit distance graph on @xmath2 vertices . in this paper",
    "we focus on the questions of this type for _",
    "diameter graphs_. a graph @xmath11 is a _ diameter graph _ in @xmath0 , if @xmath12 is a finite set of diameter 1 , and edges of @xmath1 are formed by the pairs of vertices that are at unit distance apart .",
    "diameter graphs arise naturally in the context of the finite version of the famous borsuk s problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite for the survey on borsuk s problem ) , which is stated as follows : is it true that any ( finite ) set of unit diameter in @xmath0 can be partitioned into @xmath13 subsets of strictly smaller diameter ?",
    "the finite version is equivalent to the following question concerning diameter graphs : is it true that any diameter graph @xmath1 in @xmath0 satisfies @xmath14 ?",
    "a question about diameter graphs analogous to the question from the first paragraph has a simple answer : any set of @xmath2 points in the plane generates at most @xmath2 diameters , or any diameter graph on @xmath2 vertices in the plane has at most @xmath2 edges .",
    "this was proved by h. hopf and e. pannwitz in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this result leads to a simple proof of the fact that borsuk s question for finite sets in the plane have a positive answer .",
    "indeed , it is easy to derive combinatorially that any graph @xmath1 on @xmath2 vertices with at most @xmath2 edges and such that any of its subgraphs has at least as many vertices as edges satisfies @xmath15 .",
    "a. vzsonyi conjectured that any diameter graph in @xmath16 on @xmath2 vertices has at most @xmath17 edges .",

    "vzsonyi s conjecture was proved independently by b. grnbaum @xcite , a. heppes @xcite and s. straszewicz @xcite .",
    "an interesting generalization of this result to the case of @xmath18-th diameters was obtained by f. mori and j. pach @xcite .    while the maximum number of edges in a diameter graph in @xmath19 is linear in the number of vertices , it becomes quadratic already in @xmath20 . to put the discussion in a more general context , we introduce the following notations .",

    "we follow the approach suggested by f. mori and j. pach and confirm this conjecture ( and its spherical version ) in our paper , which together with theorem [ thph ] and its spherical analogue from @xcite , mentioned in the previous section , gives us the proof of schur s conjecture both in the space and on the sphere . another problem",

    "therefore , for the halfspace formed by @xmath251 that contains @xmath191 , which we denote by @xmath315 , we have @xmath316 , while for the other ( denoted by @xmath256 ) it is the other way around .",
    "next , one can see that @xmath317 this is due to the fact that any point from @xmath318 projects from above inside the convex hull @xmath129 of the vertices of the reuleaux simplex @xmath319 ( see observation [ obs01 ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath320 .",
    "since the rotation is made continuously , we may for sure assume that the angular distance between @xmath191 and @xmath202 is less than @xmath321 .",

    "therefore , the projection of @xmath332 should fall inside @xmath129 , and , since there is more than one point in @xmath78 , we are done by lemma [ lemimp ] .",
    "thus , the second event either leads us to a contradiction , if we assume that there is no common vertex of @xmath275 and @xmath276 , or gives the common vertex of @xmath275 and @xmath276 .",

    "denote by @xmath202 the projection of @xmath191 to @xmath251 .",
    "if @xmath374 for some @xmath222 in @xmath375 , then @xmath376 this statement follows from the spherical pythagoras theorem ( point 9 from the previous subsection ) and from observation [ obs2 ] .",
    "the proof of the lemma in the spherical case should start from one of the following chain of inequalities : either @xmath377 or @xmath378 here @xmath208 are the projections of @xmath204 to the base of the rugby ball .",
    "the second inequality in both chains is justified using the previous point ( and also the next two points ) . in the euclidean case",
    "the choice of one chain of inequalities depends on which point among @xmath207 is closer to @xmath76 ( this gives us the first inequality in both chains ) . in the spherical case",
    "we can also choose one chain , since @xmath379 and by the last property from point 9 from the previous subsection , combined with observation [ obs2 ] , @xmath380 .",
    "the angle inequality holds since the vertices @xmath381 form a quadrangle with two right angles , while the sum of the angles in a quadrangle on the sphere is more than @xmath382 .",
    "* we have to verify that lemma [ lemred ] works in the spherical case .",
    "the proof goes word for word , but we present it here with the proof for the seek of clarity .",
    "[ lemreds ] consider a closed halfsphere @xmath238 in @xmath337 bounded by a diametral hypersphere @xmath239 .",
    "let @xmath240 be a sphere with center in @xmath158 , where @xmath241 .",
    "let @xmath183 be an open region on @xmath240 , @xmath242 consider two points @xmath243 @xmath244 .",
    "then one can find a point @xmath245 such that    * @xmath383 , if @xmath247 ; * @xmath384 , if @xmath249 .",
    "the equality from the statement of the lemma is obvious since @xmath183 and @xmath250 both lie on @xmath240 . as for the inequality , consider the two - dimensional diametral sphere @xmath251 that contains the points @xmath252 . the diametral circle @xmath253 splits @xmath251 into two closed halfspheres @xmath254 .",
    "let @xmath255 .",
    "there is at least one point @xmath245 in @xmath256 , which is different from @xmath257 .",
    "then we have the inequality for the angles @xmath385 and , by the spherical law of cosines ( [ cos ] ) we get that @xmath386 this is because the first summand in ( [ cos ] ) stays the same in both cases , while in the second one the only change is that the last multiple gets smaller . note that we do not need to put any restrictions on @xmath387 , as it is done in the end of point 9 of the previous subsection",
    ".    * iv . *",
    "the rest of the proof of the spherical version of lemma [ lemimp ] goes the same , since the projections of the set @xmath129 behave the same as in the euclidean case .",
    "+ having finished the description of the changes in the proof of lemma [ lemimp ] in the spherical case , we return to the proof of the theorem . as in the euclidean case , spheres @xmath280 lie in the hyperplane @xmath110 , which is orthogonal to @xmath76 .",
    "the first thing we note is that @xmath280 is a @xmath97-sphere that is not diametral .",
    "it would be diametral only if both @xmath95 and @xmath388 are diametral , which is not the case .",
    "thus , by point 6 from the previous subsection , the minimal plane that contains @xmath280 is of codimension 1 .",
    "next , note that @xmath389 this is due to the fact that both centers of @xmath95 and @xmath388 lie in @xmath76 .",
    "hence , the same should hold for @xmath110 , and by point 5 from the previous subsection we obtain the desired orthogonality .    combining the spherical version of lemma [ lemimp ] and the fact that @xmath110 is orthogonal to @xmath76 with the euclidean proof , we almost come to the last case in which we have one vertex of @xmath276 in @xmath390 while the rest lie in @xmath391 .",
    "however , we should make sure that the circumscribed ball considerations still work in the spherical case . indeed , suppose we are given two unit simplices @xmath275 , @xmath276 on @xmath3 vertices .",
    "suppose @xmath276 lies inside the @xmath3-dimensional ball @xmath107 of diameter @xmath392 , which is a ball of minimal diameter that contains @xmath275 .",
    "denote by @xmath393 the circumscribed ball for @xmath276 .",
    "then , if @xmath107 and @xmath393 do not coincide , the intersection @xmath394 is contained in a ball of smaller radius . indeed , if we choose an arbitrary point @xmath395 on the open segment connecting the centers @xmath396 of @xmath107 and @xmath393 , respectively , then by the last property in point 9 from the previous subsection , combined with the fact that @xmath397 for any @xmath398 we have @xmath399 since either @xmath400 or @xmath401 is at least @xmath347 .",
    "we obtain that @xmath276 is contained in a ball of radius strictly smaller than @xmath392 , which is impossible .",
    "thus , the centers of @xmath107 and @xmath393 coincide , and the rest of the argument in this case works exactly as for the euclidean space .    returning to the last part of the proof , one can translate it word for word from the euclidean case .",
    "we note that the plane @xmath251 satisfies the following equation : @xmath402 , which is why @xmath403 . indeed , @xmath404 and @xmath405 is less than a halfball , while @xmath406 is bigger than a halfball .",
    "similar reasoning applies for the inclusion @xmath407 .    finally , consider the case when @xmath332 falls into @xmath300 and , moreover , @xmath332 coincides with @xmath202 . to conclude the proof ,",
    "we need to check that the arc on which @xmath408 lie projects inside the spherical convex hull of vertices @xmath120 .",
    "this is equivalent to the statement that the circle @xmath409 and the sphere @xmath95 touch at @xmath224 ( in the plane @xmath76 ) . in that case",
    "the circle would lie in the exterior of the ball @xmath107 .",
    "the fact about touching is clear , so the point @xmath332 lie in @xmath283 , and we can apply the spherical analogue of lemma [ lemimp ] .",
    "the proof is complete .",
