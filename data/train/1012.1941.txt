    "as a typical family of strongly - correlated electron materials , transition metal oxides ( tmos ) possess immense novel functionalities that have drawn intensive interest in the fields of fundamental condensed matter physics , materials science , and electronic applications .",
    "the signature of tmos is the collective electron behaviors determined by the delicate equilibrium of multiple low energy excitation states or competing ground states that are sensitively influenced by doping , strain induction , or the application of external field . in the tmos with reduced dimensionality , broken symmetry , or spatial confinement ,",
    "the coupling between different degrees of freedom is normally enhanced and exotic phenomena emerge .",
    "a tremendous amount of evidence has shown that thin films , superlattices and heterostructures of tmos display an even richer diversity of remarkable properties that are related , but not identical to the bulk phenomena@xcite .",
    "one of the important and intriguing discoveries is the quasi - two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) formed at the interface between srtio@xmath0 and laalo@xmath0 @xcite , which might be the basis of the transformative concept for the new generation of electronic devices .",

    "therefore the fabrication of artificial oxide heterostructures with desired functionalities must be controllable with atomic precision .",
    "among all the techniques for the growth of low - dimensional materials , pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) and oxide molecular beam epitaxy ( ombe ) , developed with the intensive efforts to grow the high - temperature superconductor films over the past two decades , have been demonstrated to be effective for the tailored construction of multilayered oxide films @xcite .",
    "besides the capability to achieve the precision of monoatomic layer along the growth direction , it is also promising in tuning the in - plane microscopic structures in atomic scale .",

    ", width=307 ]    considering the fact that titanium oxide have lower surface free energy as compared to the srtio@xmath0 @xcite , the under - coordinated ti induced by sputtering is driven to diffuse towards the surface upon annealing . such a process is further assisted by the attractive interaction with the oxygen vacancies in the surface region that could also be induced by ar@xmath12 bombardment @xcite",
    ". therefore the established thermodynamic equilibrium can be described as a ti - enriched surface covering the stoichiometric srtio@xmath0 bulk crystal . as the sputtering dose increases , the depth of the affected region increases and consequently the overall amount of ti defects available to diffuse to the surface increases .",
    "such an increase can not be detected by xps since the depth of xps signal is much smaller than that of the region affected by sputtering . however , after annealing , the increment of the surface ti concentration will be fully manifested by xps within few top layers . on the other hand , it is commonly agreed that the formation energy and the migration barriers of oxygen vacancies are low in the bulk srtio@xmath0 crystal . therefore the oxygen ions diffuse to the surface upon annealing , keeping the metal cations sufficiently coordinated to reduce the surface energy .",
    "more importantly , such a mechanism determines the intrinsic dependence of the surface chemical composition of srtio@xmath0(110 ) on the sputtering dose , offering the tunability of different reconstructions by adjusting the sputtering dose that is equivalent to evaporating sr or ti metal .    to further examine the properties of the srtio@xmath0(110 ) surface with different reconstructions ,",
    "the xps core - level and valence - band spectra are carefully compared .",
    "figure  12  ( a ) shows the ti _",
    "2p _ core - level spectra taken from the monophased ( 4@xmath11 ) and ( 6@xmath18 ) surface , respectively .",
    "the ( 4@xmath11 ) surface shows mainly the ti@xmath8 characteristic , while the ( 6@xmath18 ) surface also shows the existence of the ti@xmath34 species as revealed by the low - energy shoulder @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the chemical composition analyses that indicates the ti enrichment on the o termination .",
    "figure  12  ( b ) compares the valence - band spectra of the ( 4@xmath11)- and ( 6@xmath18)-reconstructed surface",
    ". the highest occupied state is determined by linearly extrapolating the onset edge of the signals in the spectra .",

    "e__@xmath36 in the ( 6@xmath18 ) phase , indicating the existence of the ti@xmath34 species @xcite that is consistent with the ti  _ 2p _ core - level spectra .",
    "the appearance of the in - gap states also suggests that the o - terminated srtio@xmath0(110 ) surface can be stabilized by filling electrons to the new states , in addition to the stoichiometry modification and adsorption of ( charged ) clusters as on the ( 4@xmath11 ) surface that also could be responsible for the charge compensation .",
    "since the surface electronic structure is varied with different reconstructions , the initial epitaxial growth behavior is also influenced .",
    "figure  13 shows the different adsorption behaviors of sr and ti metals on the ( 4@xmath11)- and ( 2@xmath18)-reconstructed surfaces . with @xmath170.02  ml sr",
    "adsorbed onto the ( 4@xmath11 ) phase at rt , there are round protrusions appearing in the stm image , darker and smaller than those original clusters , as shown in fig .  13  ( a ) . by the statistics of the density of the adsorbed clusters , we found that sr adsorbs as isolated single adatoms on top of the 4@xmath1stripes . increasing the sr dosage results in a higher density of the adatoms",
    "whose distribution still strictly follows the stripes .",
    "the sr atoms adsorbed on the ( 2@xmath18 ) phase aggregate into randomly distributed clusters with nonuniform size .",
    "this might be the result of the strong interaction of sr atoms with the ( 2@xmath18)-reconstructed surface due to its high reactivity .",
    "however , the adsorption behavior of ti atoms is different from that of sr adatoms .",
    "they aggregate into randomly distributed clusters with nonuniform size on the both ( 4@xmath11 ) and ( 2@xmath18 ) reconstructions .",
    "we establish a clear phase diagram of the srtio@xmath0(110 ) surface , as shown in fig .",
    "14 . the surface reconstruction phase can be tuned from the ( 5@xmath11)- to ( 4@xmath11)-reconstructed surface of the srtio termination , then to the ( 2@xmath18)- and finally to the ( 6@xmath18)-reconstructed surface of the o termination .",
    "all the structural phase transitions are reversibly driven by the change of the [ ti]/[sr ] , which can be tuned by adjusting the sputtering dose or the amount of sr / ti adsorption .",
    "these two tuning methods are equivalent because the under - coordinated ti induced by sputtering tend to diffuse towards the surface upon annealing",
    ". the electronic states of pure ti@xmath8 valence are detected on the ( 4@xmath11 ) surface .",
    "in contrast , they are mixed with ti@xmath34 on the ( 6@xmath18 ) surface .",
    "this causes the o termination more active than the ( 4@xmath11)-reconstructed srtio termination , resulting in the different absorption behaviors during the initial epitaxial growth .",
