    "some of the underlying ideas date back to lorenz early studies , in 1965@xcite .",

    ".    a `` covariant '' set of vectors would seem _ not _ to require gram - schmidt constraints , or lagrange multipliers , because orthogonality is not required .",
    "even so , all the existing computational algorithms which have been developed to find covariant vectors begin by finding the orthonormal gram - schmidt vectors .",
    "_ two sets _ of gram - schmidt vectors are the next requirement , the usual forward - in - time vectors @xmath78 and the not - so - usual backward - in - time set @xmath79 .",
    "this second set of vectors is obtained by post - processing the time - reversed phase - space trajectory .    in time - reversible energy - conserving hamiltonian mechanics",
    "the reversed trajectory can be as `` natural '' as the forward trajectory .",
    "in dissipative systems , with phase - space shrinkage , the stored and reversed trajectory is typically `` unnatural '' , and would violate the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "unlike the gram - schmidt forward and backward vectors [ we will denote them by @xmath78 and @xmath79 ] , the covariant vectors @xmath80 are defined so as to be _ identical _ , at least for hamiltonian mechanics , in the two time directions , that is , `` covariant '' .",
    "the gram - schmidt behavior , with the forward and backward vectors generally different , is a symmetry breaking whose source is not at all apparent in the underlying time - symmetric differential equations of motion .",
    "the differential equations for the time development of the covariant vectors account for the simultaneous stretching and rotation of an infinitesimal phase - space hypersphere .",
    "evidently the _ maximum _ growth ( and maximum shrinkage ) rates correspond to the usual largest lyapunov exponents forward and backward in time , @xmath81 and @xmath82 in an @xmath37-dimensional phase space . another covariant offset vector parallels the local direction of the phase - space velocity , @xmath83 . the remaining @xmath84 covariant vectors require more work .",
    "the difference between the gram - schmidt and covariant phase - space vectors is illustrated for the simple harmonic oscillator in figure 2 .",
    "the relatively readable wolfe - samelson approach@xcite begins with the gram - schmidt sets @xmath85 , forward and backward in time .",
    "then covariant unit vectors are associated with the long - time - averaged individual lyapunov exponents , beginning with the second ( or , using time symmetry , beginning with the next - to - last and working backwards ) .",
    "the covariant vectors are then expressed as linear combinations of ( some of ) the forward and backward gram - schmidt vectors .",

    "second _ covariant vector can be written as a linear combination of the first two gram - schmidt vectors : @xmath87 the constants @xmath88 are then determined by solving a relatively simple eigenvalue problem . likewise , the next - to - last covariant vector can be written in terms of the first two gram - schmidt vectors from the time - reversed trajectory : @xmath89 in general the @xmath90th covariant vector can be expressed as a sum of @xmath90 gram - schmidt vectors with the constants @xmath91 determined by solving a set of linear equations .",
    "all of these vectors are _ unit vectors _ , with length 1 .",
    "the many method variations ( using the first few , the last few , or some of _ both _ sets of gram - schmidt vectors ) are discussed in wolfe s thesis , which is currently available online .",
    "the appendix of romero - bastida , paz , lpez , and rodriguez work@xcite , as well as the kuptsov - parlitz review@xcite are also useful guides .",
    "the main difficulty in putting all of this work into perspective is a result of the fractal / singular nature of the phase - space vectors .",
    "this structure can be traced to bifurcations in the past history and/or in the future evolution of a particular phase point .",
    "this sensitivity to initial conditions means that slightly different differential - equation algorithms can lead to qualitatively different trajectories , making it hard to tell whether or not two computer programs are consistent with one another .",
    "the best approach to code validation is to reproduce properties of the covariant vectors which are insensitive to the integration algorithm .",
    "we will consider some of these properties for our three example oscillator models .",
    "the first of our three illustrative oscillator problems is an equilibrium problem in hamiltonian mechanics , a harmonic oscillator with unit frequency and with a scale factor @xmath21 set equal to 2 : @xmath92 the local lyapunov exponents for such an oscillator depend upon @xmath21 and vanish in the usual case where @xmath93 .",
    "a @xmath20 phase - space plot of a typical orbit for @xmath94 was shown in figure 1 .",
    "the oscillator orbit we choose to analyze is the ellipse shown there : @xmath95 the local lyapunov exponents describe the instantaneous growth rates of infinitesimal `` offset vectors '' comoving with the flow .",

    "scaled harmonic oscillator it is possible to solve analytically for the gram - schmidt vectors forward and backward in time as well as the covariant vectors and all the corresponding local exponents , @xmath97 once the initial conditions are specified . see figure 2 for an illustration of the following choice of initial values , at @xmath98 : @xmath99 in the course of the motion , with period @xmath100 , the first forward gram - schmidt vector @xmath101 , which is generally identical to the first covariant vector , turns out to be _ always _ radial .",
    "this vector is necessarily perpendicular to @xmath102 .",
    "the vectors @xmath103 and @xmath104 generally differ .",

    "_ linearized _",
    "small-@xmath106 motion equations .",
    "because the oscillator motion equations _ are _ linear , these oscillator results are correct for finite , not just infinitesimal , vectors .",
    "the gram - schmidt lyapunov exponents can be calculated as lagrange multipliers which maintain the orthonormal relations between @xmath107 in both the forward and the backward directions . for this simple problem",
    "the vectors are unchanged by time reversal , @xmath108 .",
    "the first vector is not constrained in orientation , but is restricted to constant length by the lagrange multiplier @xmath30 : @xmath109 using @xmath30 in either the @xmath110 or @xmath111 equation gives a differential equation for the unit vector @xmath112 , which simplifies with the definition of a new variable , the angle @xmath113 : @xmath114 @xmath115   \\longrightarrow\\ ] ] @xmath116 although the probability density for @xmath117 [ or @xmath118 ] diverges , whenever @xmath119 [ or whenever @xmath120 ] , the probability density for @xmath121 , which describes the nonuniform phase - space rotary motion , is well - behaved , as shown in figure 3 .",

    "the _ general _ features illustrated by this problem include ( 1 ) the orthogonality of the gram - schmidt vectors , ( 2 ) the possibility of obtaining a `` reversed '' trajectory by using a stored forward trajectory , changing only the sign of the timestep @xmath126 , ( 3 ) the identity of the first gram - schmidt vector with the first covariant vector , and ( 4 ) the identity of the trajectory direction with the covariant vector corresponding to the time - averaged exponent @xmath127 . in the next problem we study the directions of the forward and backward vectors and show that they typically differ , though the _ time - averaged _ exponents ( for a sufficiently long calculation ) agree , apart from their signs .",
    "here we consider the second model oscillator .",
    "its _ nonequilibrium _ temperature profile , @xmath129 provides both chaotic and regular solutions , depending on the strength of the temperature gradient .",

    "for the smaller value @xmath130 , the _ second _ lyapunov exponent vanishes , @xmath131 .",
    "its probability density , shown in figure 6 , is quite different to that of the second covariant exponent , @xmath132 , which remains parallel to the trajectory direction at all times . for the larger limit - cycle value , @xmath133 ,",
    "the longtime orbit is a limit cycle , with period 8.650 . on this limit cycle",
    "the largest lyapunov exponent is identical to the largest covariant exponent , and necessarily vanishes .",

    "the three - dimensional system of motion equations , @xmath136 can be `` reversed '' in either of two ways : ( 1 ) replace @xmath137 by @xmath138 in the fourth - order runge - kutta integrator or ( 2 ) leaving @xmath139 unchanged , change the _ signs _ of the momentum @xmath18 and the friction coefficient @xmath43 so that the underlying physical system traces its coordinate history backward in time , @xmath140 . in either case longtime stability with decreasing time",

    "we have adopted the first reversibility definition throughout the present work .",
    "it is necessary to recognize that the `` motion '' ( forward in time ) we analyze _ is _ dissipative , though time - reversible , while the reversed motion ( backward in time and contrary to the second law of thermodynamics ) is actually so unstable ( because @xmath141 ) as to be unobservable unless the trajectory has been stored in advance .",

    "the gram - schmidt vectors differ , reflecting the past and steadfastly ignorant of the future .",
    "consider a purely - hamiltonian situation , the sudden inelastic collision of two rapidly - moving blocks , converting ordered kinetic energy to heat .",
    "the gram - schmidt vectors turn out to be more localized in the forward direction of time than in the ( completely unphysical ) reversed direction , where the particle trajectories have been stored@xcite .",
    "the phase - space directions corresponding to maximum growth and decay ( easy to calculate by singular value decomposition of the symmetrized @xmath24 matrix and relatively smooth in phase space , rather than multifractal ) show the same time symmetry as do the covariant vectors .",
    "this time symmetry seems unhelpful for describing the irreversibility of this purely - hamiltonian shockwave process .",
    "we like the time asymmetry of the gram - schmidt vectors , reflecting as they do the past - based nature of the second law of thermodynamics .    despite the norm - independence of the lyapunov vectors",
    "it is apparent that `` local '' ( in phase - space or in time ) lyapunov exponents depend on the chosen coordinate system .",
    "even the simple harmonic oscillator considered here shows coordinate - dependent local exponents .",
    "the time symmetry - breaking associated with time - reversible dissipative systems ( like the three - dimensional and four - dimensional oscillator models studied here ) prevents backward analyses unless trajectories are stored .",
    "lyapunov instability helps _ attract _ a repellor state ( violating the second law ) to the law - abiding strange attractor . like the overall trajectory ,",
    "the gram - schmidt vectors are themselves unstable to symmetry breaking .",
    "a reversed trajectory calculation will not also reverse the gram - schmidt vectors unless those vectors too are stored from a forward trajectory .",
    "the covariant vectors are the same going forward and backward in time .",
    "the symmetry breaking which naturally occurs can only be avoided by repeating a trajectory , making it possible to find the covariant solution .    despite the double - precision accuracy of runge - kutta solutions",
    "it is difficult to validate computer programs for dissipative chaotic systems precisely due to their lyapunov instability .",
    "for this reason the squared projections of the offset vectors and the exponent histograms are good choices for validation .",
    "the details of specific program results necessarily vary and reflect the fractal nature of the phase - space singularities describing the inevitable past and future bifurcations .",
    "the fractal nature of these singular points frustrates any attempt to gain accuracy through mesh refinement .",
    "both the covariant and the gram - schmidt exponents share this fractal nature , but differently .",
    "the gram - schmidt vectors are analogous to passengers reactions to a curvy highway while the covariant view is that of a stationary pedestrian observer .",
