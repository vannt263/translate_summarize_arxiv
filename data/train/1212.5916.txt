    "<S> the quantum admittance of an interacting / coupled mesoscopic system and its series expansion are obtained by using the refermionization method . with the help of these non - perturbative results , it is possible to study the dependencies of the admittance according to the applied dc voltage , temperature , and frequency without any restriction on the relative values of these variables . </S>",
    "<S> explicit expressions of the admittance are derived both in the limits of weak and strong interactions / coupling strength , giving clear indication of the inductive or capacitive nature of the mesoscopic system . </S>",
    "<S> they help to determine the conditions under which the phase of the current with respect to the ac voltage is positive . </S>"
