    "many significant experiments concerning topics related to quantum information processing , such as quantum teleportation  @xcite , dense coding  @xcite , quantum key distribution  @xcite , and controlled - not gate  @xcite , have been conducted using polarization - entangled photon pairs generated via spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) processes with @xmath4-barium borate ( bbo ) crystals @xcite",
    ". however , these sources have relatively low ( @xmath5 140 hz / mw ) brightness ( @xmath6 ; coincidence counts per second per pump power , without loss - correction ) because of inefficient collection of the generated photons and small nonlinear coefficient . to date",
    ", considerable efforts have been made towards achieving greater brightness and higher entanglement quality in such cases .",
    "in particular , in the early 2000s , nonlinear crystals with periodically poled ( pp ) structures and quasi - phase - matching ( qpm ) conditions yielded remarkably increased brightness  @xcite without polarization entanglement . to realize polarization - entangled photon - pair sources with qpm crystals , schemes involving post - selection  @xcite , crossed crystals  @xcite , a folded mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi )  @xcite , a polarization sagnac interferometer ( psi )  @xcite , two crystals sagnac interferometer  @xcite , and linear double - pass geometry  @xcite have been demonstrated , which are applied under collinear conditions . in particular ,",
    "two outstanding schemes have been reported by fedrizzi _",
    "et al_.  @xcite and steinlechner _ et al_.  @xcite , who detected 271- and 390-khz / mw / nm spectral brightness ( @xmath7 ; @xmath6 per bandwidth ) and more than 99% fidelity with one of the bell states using type - ii and type-0 spdc processes with a pp potassium titanyl phosphate ( ktiopo@xmath0 ; ppktp ) crystal , respectively , with stable configurations .",
    "however , the schemes reported in those studies involve an intricate alignment or specialized optics such as a dual - wave plate , a specifically tailored wave plate , and a temperature - stabilized compensation crystal .    here , we demonstrate a polarization - entangled photon - pair generation scheme  @xcite based on a type - ii non - collinear ppktp crystal and employing a continuous - wave ( cw ) pump laser  @xcite and an mzi - configured distinguishability compensator  @xcite . our source is stable and relatively easy to build up because of the simple configuration and lack of specialized optics .",
    "the pump - power @xmath8 dependence of the source is examined in order to estimate the @xmath6 and pair - production - rate ( loss - corrected @xmath6 ) , and the crystal - temperature @xmath9 dependence is monitored in order to demonstrate wavelength ( @xmath10 ) tunability .",
    "we also conduct quantum state tomography ( qst ) @xcite to evaluate the entanglement quality of the generated states .",
    "the detected @xmath6 , @xmath10 tunability , and concurrence ( one of proper measures of the degree of entanglement  @xcite ) are 4.2 khz / mw , 0.198 nm/@xmath11c , and 0.975 , respectively .",
    "we expect that enhanced @xmath6 , @xmath7 and a greater degree of entanglement can be achieved if optimized focusing parameters , a longer crystal , and a shorter coincidence window are employed .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s2 ] , we introduce and explain the experiment setup of our polarization - entanglement photon - pair source and measurement apparatus using a schematic diagram . in section  [ s3 ] , we briefly describe the qpm condition of the type - ii non - collinear spdc process and the theoretical foundation behind the expected pair - production - rate through comparison with a type - ii collinear psi setup .",
    "we also provide the results of numerical calculations , which are used as a reference for comparison against the experimental results presented in section  [ s4 ] . from those experimental results , we estimate and discuss the @xmath6 , pair - production - rate , @xmath10 tunability , entanglement quality , and stability of our source .",
    "finally , a summary is presented in section  [ s5 ] .     of @xmath12406.2 nm and a full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) bandwidth of @xmath13 = 0.2(1 ) ghz .",

    "a single - longitudinal - mode cw laser is employed as a pump , having a center wavelength @xmath21 and full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) bandwidth @xmath22 measured at approximately 406.2 nm and 0.2 ghz , respectively ; these measurements were obtained using a spectrometer ( _ ocean optics _",

    ", we select two spatial modes ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) that are tilted at approximately 0.85@xmath11 relative to the @xmath18-axis , cento - symmetric to each other , and along the @xmath30-plane .",
    "the two spatial modes are collimated by a lens ( @xmath14 = 200 mm , arc - b ) .",
    "each photon ( @xmath25 or @xmath27 polarized ) of a pair can be emitted in either of the two modes ( @xmath28 or @xmath29 ) , but the counterpart photon must then be emitted in the other direction ( i.e. , @xmath29 or @xmath28 , respectively ) , in accordance with the law of conservation of momentum for near - degenerate cases ( @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the center wavelengths of the @xmath25 and @xmath27 polarized photons , respectively ) . therefore ,",
    "if all other degrees of freedom are indistinguishable , the polarizations of a photon pair in modes @xmath28 and @xmath29 are entangled as @xmath34 .",

    "furthermore , in general , the refractive indices of the @xmath25 and @xmath27 polarizations in the crystal differ , so photons of two polarizations in a given mode are temporally distinguishable because of the group velocity difference ; this holds even for the degenerate case .",
    "thus , the generated polarization state is entangled with other degrees of freedom as @xmath35 . to compensate for this distinguishability",
    ", we adopt an additional setup  @xcite which consists of a zero - order half - wave plate ( hwp ) at 45@xmath11 , an optical delay line ( odl ) , and a broadband pbs .",
    "after proper adjustment of the odl , the polarization states of a photon - pair in modes @xmath36 and @xmath37 of fig .",

    ". the fast axes of the qwp are fixed at 45@xmath11 from the horizontal direction , and we adjust the hwp angle to obtain @xmath40 .    to measure the polarizations of the generated state , we introduce polarization analyzers consisting of a qwp and a broadband linear polarizer ( lp ) .",
    "after passing the analyzers , the photons are coupled into smfs for 780 nm via aspheric lenses ( @xmath41 = 8 mm ) and detected using single - photon counting modules ( spcm ) .",
    "electric pulses from the spcm are counted by a field - programmable gate array ( fpga ) system calibrated for single and coincidence counts ( coincidence window @xmath23 55 ns ) .",
    "we also measure the photon @xmath10 values in modes @xmath36 and @xmath37 using a wavelength tunable filter ( tf , fwhm = 1.82 nm ) . in fig .",

    "ktp is a biaxial crystal and its refractive indices for principal axes depending on wavelength and @xmath9 have been well studied  @xcite . here",

    "we should note that numerically calculated values of @xmath55 differ depending on the references used for the sellmeier formulas , as these expressions are empirical relationships obtained from individual finite experimental datasets .",

    "the datapoints colored blue , green , red , and black correspond to @xmath95 = 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "the total duration of the data measurement for the results shown in fig .",
    "[ homp ] was more than 1 h.    , where @xmath19 = @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the datapoints colored in blue , green , red , and black correspond to @xmath95 = 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively . ]    the experimental configuration , especially the compensation section , employed in the approach presented in this study is based on mzi .",
    "thus , the phase stability is fundamentally limited , because of the vibrations of the optic mounts .",
    "however , the sagnac configuration is robust against this effect . if we denote the two optical path lengths from the ppktp crystal to the pbs in modes @xmath28 and @xmath29 in fig .  [ setup ] as @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively , the @xmath19 difference between the superposed two states in eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) induced by the difference in optical path length is @xmath100 , where @xmath101 = @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , the total phase fluctuation @xmath103 due to the optics vibration @xmath104 in the mzi can be expressed as @xmath105 , where @xmath106 and @xmath107 is the number of independent optics in the mzi .",
    "the order of @xmath104 is typically sub - micrometer in the case on a vibration - isolated optical table .",
    "for example , for parameters of @xmath108 = @xmath109 @xmath23 50 nm , @xmath110 nm , @xmath107 = 5 , and @xmath104 = 0.1 @xmath16 m , the expected value of @xmath103 is approximately 0.017 @xmath111 2@xmath112 ( @xmath71 2% ) .",
    "thus , the phase fluctuations are negligible ( @xmath113 ) in our experimental results ( @xmath114 10 nm ) . moreover , for the degenerate case ( @xmath115 = @xmath39 ) , @xmath103 can be fully neglected ( as in the sagnac configuration ) , because @xmath116 = 0",
    ". this may be comprehensive in terms of quantum mechanics .",
    "the two superposed states @xmath117 and @xmath118 of a photon pair immediately after generation via spdc are simultaneously influenced by the phase fluctuations of the optics in the mzi ; thus , this phase can be factored out as an overall phase .",
    "we have demonstrated a stable and bright polarization - entangled photon - pair source obtained via a type - ii non - collinear spdc process with a 10-mm - long ppktp crystal .",
    "the detected brightness was 4.2 khz / mw , and the spectral - pair - production - rate was estimated as being 74 khz / mw / nm .",
    "further , we expect that a spectral - pair - production - rate of more than 293 khz / mw / nm can be achieved via optimization of the focusing conditions and through use of a 25-mm crystal , or photon collection using mmf as previous studies  @xcite .",
    "this expectation is based on the fact that the non - collinear setup can collect twice the number of photon pairs as a collinear setup .",
    "our setup is as stable as the sagnac configuration for the degenerate case .",
    "although this stability decreases with increased wavelength non - degeneracy , the instability is acceptable if the non - degeneracy is not excessive compared with the mzi compensator instability . for various photon - pair wavelengths ( @xmath119 : 808 - 816 nm ) obtained by controlling the crystal temperature ( 62 - 102@xmath11 ) , the fidelities with one of the bell states ( @xmath120 ) and",
    "the concurrences of the generated states were estimated as being approximately 0.97 - 0.98 , despite the large coincidence window ( 55 ns ) .",
    "therefore , our source is bright , wavelength - tunable , and relatively stable ( comparable to the sagnac configuration setup ) with no requirement for specialized optical components .",
    "further , this source has high entanglement quality ; thus , we expect that it will be utilized in various experiments concerning quantum information processing .",
