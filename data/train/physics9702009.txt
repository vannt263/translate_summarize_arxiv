    "the determination of spatial scales within the collisionless shock front is one of the central problems for observational shock physics .",
    "the width of the shock ramp , defined as the main transition layer between upstream to downstream plasma , is of particular interest . without spacecraft measurements in a spatial",
    "rather then temporal frame of reference , it is impossible to make any comparisons between observations and theoretical models .    for bow shock studies ,",
    "generally one of two methods has been applied to transform the time series observed by in - situ magnetometers into a spatial magnetic field profile : ( 1 ) the comparison of shock observations made by multiple spacecraft with known separations in time and space ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( 2 ) the comparison of the temporal duration of the shock foot feature as observed by a single spacecraft with the spatial foot length predicted by a model based on the motion of specularly reflected ions ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "both methods assume that the bow shock is stationary and one - dimensional , and each has its own limitations .",
    "the first is not reliable when the time delay between spacecraft observations is too large @xcite ( non - stationarity can affect the results ) or too small ( relative errors become large ) .",
    "also , large transverse spatial separations of the spacecraft with respect to the shock front can introduce error due to the three - dimensional nature of the bow shock .",
    "the second method is not applicable to laminar shocks ( shocks observed during low mach number and low plasma @xmath0 conditions ) .",
    "ion reflection does not play a dominant dissipative role at such shocks , and so there is little or no foot structure available to measure .",
    "( in high mach number shocks , the second method can also be problematic , since the ion reflection is clearly not specular @xcite which affects the model s predictions . )    because of these limitations , it is desirable to have another independent method for determining shock scale lengths , particularly for laminar shock observations made by a single spacecraft . in this paper , we make use of the noncoplanar component of the magnetic field in the shock ramp in order to estimate a scale size which can in turn be compared with spacecraft observations of low mach number shocks . in section 2",
    "we briefly outline the theoretical basis of this method , and then apply the technique to an example of a bow shock observation made by the isee spacecraft ( section 3 ) . in section 4 , we examine the results obtained from a variety of low mach and low @xmath0 bow shock observations , and find that the proposed method works well , even for shocks which are not strictly laminar .",
    "within the ramp layer of a fast collisionless shock ( such as the earth s bow shock ) , the magnetic field is observed to rotate out of the coplanarity plane ( the plane defined by the shock normal and the upstream and downstream magnetic field vectors ) @xcite .",
    "the analytical relation between this noncoplanar component and the main magnetic component of the shock profile was first derived by @xcite phenomenologically in an integral form ; its approximate nature has been shown observationally by @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite examined the noncoplanar relation using a general two - fluid hydrodynamics approach , and carried out the derivation with only the widely accepted assumptions of shock stationarity , one - dimensionality , and quasi - neutrality . in the coplanarity",
    "coordinate system where @xmath1 denotes the direction along the shock normal , @xmath2 is along the magnetic field component in the shock plane , and @xmath3 is directed out of the coplanarity plane , the general expression for the noncoplanar magnetic field component ( @xmath4 ) is as follows : @xmath5 in the limit @xmath6 , and where @xmath7 is the number density ; @xmath8 is the @xmath1 component of the hydrodynamic velocity ; @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( number flux conservation ) ; and @xmath11 are components of the pressure tensor .",
    "it has been shown by @xcite that the appearance of @xmath12 is mainly due to the presence of reflected ions , and that @xmath13 for low mach number shocks @xcite .",
    "for laminar shocks it is expected @xcite that the relative contribution of the pressure terms is @xmath14 l and therefore the following approximate expression holds : @xmath15 where @xmath16 ( i.e. , @xmath17 would be the wavenumber of a whistler , phasestanding upstream of the ramp ) , @xmath18 is the angle between the upstream magnetic field and the shock normal , @xmath19 is the alfvnic mach number , and @xmath20 is the ion intertial length .",
    "it should be emphasized that is a differential analog of the integral relation developed by @xcite .",
    "however , should be applied only within the ramp where the main contribution @xmath21 is not small , otherwise the term @xmath22 can dominate .    therefore , by estimating the slope of the main magnetic field component ( @xmath23 ) in the vicinity of the maximum noncoplanar component in an observed shock ramp , one can determine an independent estimate of the velocity of the shock front from .",
    "it is then straightforward to transform the observed temporal shock profile into a spatial one suitable for comparison with theory , other shock observations , and/or simulations .",
    "an advantage of the method outlined above is that it gives the scale in the relative physical units and not absolute units .",
    "it encounters , however , the same difficulties from the determination of the vector basis @xmath24 , as all other methods .",
    "further difficulties can arise from since it is sensitive to gradients in the field profile ; noise and wave activity associated with an observation of a bow shock can make the measurement of @xmath23 difficult , and traditional filtering techniques do not preserve gradients well . for laminar shocks ,",
    "a simple variation of the method approximates the shock ramp profile with a hyperbolic tangent function along the @xmath1 direction : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 refer to the total field upstream and downstream of the shock front , and the coefficient 3 ensures that @xmath28 of the magnetic field variation occurs within the ramp , @xmath29",
    ". in this case , from one immediately has an expression for the ramp width : @xmath30 this approach requires accurate measurements of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , but is less sensitive to the local @xmath31 gradient than the direct application of to an observed shock profile .",
    "in the present section we apply the proposed method to a quasi - perpendicular collisionless shock crossing that was observed by the isee-1 and -2 spacecraft on november 26 , 1977 , 06:10 ut . the magnetic profile of this shock was measured by the isee-1 and -2 ucla fluxgate magnetometers @xcite .",
    "data is filtered to obey the nyquist criterion and then sampled at the rate of 16 vectors per second . by averaging over a minute of data upstream and downstream of the shock front and applying the coplanarity theorem , the shock normal is determined , and the angle between the shock normal and the upstream magnetic field is found to be @xmath32 . figure  [ s0066nif ]    [ ] [ ] @xmath33 [ b][t]@xmath34 [ b][t]@xmath35 [ b][t]@xmath4 [ b][t]@xmath31 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37.,title=\"fig : \" ]    shows the high - resolution isee-1 observation of total magnetic field and its three components @xmath38 , rotated into coplanar coordinates .",
    "plasma measurements of the upstream solar wind are obtained from the isee-1 and isee-3 solar wind experiments @xcite , and are used to calculate the following parameters : ion inertial length , @xmath39 ; the alfvnic mach number @xmath40 ( so that @xmath41 ) ; and electron and ion beta , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .    in order to remove short wavelength noise while maintaining the gradients within the shock profile ,",
    "the data was denoised applying a discrete wavelet transform ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( using the daubechies-10 wavelet ) and removing the 6 finest scales .",
    "this approximately corresponds to the removal of scales shorter than @xmath44 data points , which in turn roughly corresponds to 4 second averaging for this 1/16 sec .",
    "resolution observation .",
    "although substantial oscillations persist in the upstream and downstream regions , the behavior of @xmath4 and @xmath31 within the ramp is consistent with the theoretical prediction , as seen in figure  [ s0066nifdn6 ] .",
    "[ ] [ ] [ b][t]@xmath34 [ b][t]@xmath35 [ b][t]@xmath4 [ b][t]@xmath31     comparison of @xmath45 with the slope of @xmath31 gives the following shock velocity estimate from the noncoplanarity : @xmath46 .",
    "independently , the shock velocity estimated from the isee-1 and isee-2 spacecraft separation is @xmath47 ( separation @xmath48 along the shock normal and ramp crossing time separation of 3.5 s ) .",
    "the two estimates agree within 50% deviation .    applying the hyperbolic tangent approximation from equation ,",
    "the ramp width is estimated to be @xmath49 .",
    "measuring the ramp based upon two - spacecraft comparisons , ramp width is found to be @xmath50 .",
    "( the temporal duration of the isee-1 ramp observation is approximately 10.25 sec . )",
    "uncertainty in both calculations is primarily dominated by the uncertainty in the shock normal determination ( which is in turn a result in deviations from the upstream and downstream field measurements ) .",
    "these two estimations of ramp width agree within 20% .",
    "in order to estimate the reliability of the method outlined in the previous section , we compare the results of the proposed approach from a variety of low - mach number shock observations .",
    "table 1    contains relevant parameters for a selection of shocks observed by the isee spacecraft : the alfvenic mach number ( @xmath19 ) , ratio of criticality ( @xmath51 ) , @xmath18 ( as determined by coplanarity ) , total @xmath0 of the upstream plasma , the variation of the normal component of the magnetic field during the observation of the shock ramp ( normalized by the maximum noncoplanar component in the ramp , @xmath52 ) , and the results from estimating ramp width using equation ( @xmath53 ) and from the comparison of the isee observations ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "these shocks were selected for their low-@xmath0 , low - mach number , quasi - perpendicular ( @xmath55 ) characteristics , as well as being observed at times when the isee-1 and -2 spacecraft configurations were ideal for determining fine spatial scales ( i.e. , small spatial and temporal separations between observations , and @xmath18 s calculated by coplanarity and by using an ellipsoidal model of the bow shock agree within @xmath56 ) .",
    "nearly - perpendicular shocks ( @xmath57 ) are avoided due to the difficulties of determining the shock normal vectors from coplanarity for such shocks .",
    "also , perpendicular shocks may not have the same whistler mode structure as shocks with lower @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "many of these shocks have been examined previously by @xcite .    for six out of seven shocks ,",
    "agreement between observations and predictions is very good ( within 30% ) ; in comparison , a study of shock velocities based upon two spacecraft observations and on estimations of shock foot length reports agreement within 35% for only half of the shocks examined @xcite .",
    "also , observation and prediction using the method outlined in this paper are comparable even when the shock is no longer strictly laminar : several of the shocks listed in table  1 are slightly supercritical ( i.e. , the ratio of criticality is greater than 1 ) and are associated with a plasma @xmath0 that is nt especially low ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the shock observed on 79 august 13 , 1427 ut is an exception : equation does not accurately estimate its ramp width .",
    "this can be explained by considering the effects of turbulence as evidenced in the deviations of the @xmath35 field component within the ramp layer .",
    "equation assumes @xmath35 to remain constant throughout the shock observation , but in reality this is not always so .",
    "two dimensional disturbances and plasma turbulence on the shock front can obscure the coplanarity rotation . within the shock ramp on 79 aug .",
    "13 , fluctuations of @xmath35 are on the order of @xmath59 , resulting in an under - estimated ramp width from . even with the somewhat stringent requirements placed on selecting the shocks listed in table 1 , non - stationarity and turbulence are still a factor which can not be ignored . in figure  [ stat ] ,    [ t][b]@xmath52 [ b][t]@xmath60   remains constant throughout the shock ramp , the prediction of ramp width is the most accurate .",
    "open squares indicate supercritical shocks.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the ratio of observed and predicted ramp widths are compared with the deviation of @xmath35 ( normalized to the maximum @xmath4 component ) .",
    "the shock ramps that agree best with the prediction also have the most constant @xmath35 components , and even a noticeable deviation in @xmath35 can still result in a reasonable estimation of ramp width .",
    "the light data points in figure  [ stat ] correspond to supercritical shocks ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "we have examined the relationship between the noncoplanar component and gradient of the main component of the magnetic field within the collisionless shock ramp layer . by estimating the scale size of the ramp width based upon this relationship and comparing that length with the temporal duration of a shock ramp observation , the velocity of the shock speed in the spacecraft frame can be calculated .",
    "the observed temporal shock profile can then be transformed into a spatial frame , suitable for comparison with other shock observations and with theory .",
    "based upon a sampling of bow shock observations made by the isee-1 and -2 spacecraft , we conclude that this technique is a satisfactory alternative when two - spacecraft comparisons are not feasible , provided that mach number and plasma @xmath0 are low ( although not strictly laminar ) and the rotation of the shock profile into the coplanarity plane is fairly clean .",
