    "zeus is one of the two colliding beam detectors operating at the hera electron - proton collider at desy , germany . in september 2000",
    ", hera completed an eight year running period which provided measurements of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) physics cross sections over a kinematic regime that spans several orders of magnitude of the dis parameters , bjorken @xmath0 and photon virtuality @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "for the determination of the cross section @xmath2 the accurate knowledge of the luminosity @xmath3 is required since @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the corrected measured rate of a particular dis process . in zeus experiment",
    "the most accurate luminosity measurement achieved is 1.1% .",
    "currently hera is undergoing a luminosity upgrade and is scheduled to start the new physics run in august 2001 .",
    "the goal is to increase the peak luminosity from @xmath6 before the upgrade , to @xmath7 after the upgrade . the required accuracy in the luminosity measurement after the upgrade is @xmath8 .",
    "the current zeus luminosity monitoring system has to be modified in order to meet the required accuracy because of two new major problems after the hera luminosity upgrade :    1 .",
    "significant increase in the synchrotron radiation ( sr ) .",
    "increase in the number of overlayed events ( pile - up ) for the physics process ( @xmath9 ) used to measure luminosity , to @xmath10 per hera bunch crossing .    the luminosity spectrometer presented in these proceedings is a new method of measuring luminosity at zeus which solves the problem of sr and pile - up , meeting the requirements in the luminosity accuracy imposed by the zeus physics goals .",
    "zeus has been succesfully measuring luminosity using the bethe - heitler ( b - h ) @xmath11 brehmsstrahlung process which is known theoretically within @xmath12 .",
    "the photon is radiated with a very small angle with respect to the e - p axis ( @xmath13 ) and in the past , the rate of these photons was measured by a calorimeter positioned in the hera tunnel 107 meters away from the interaction point . after the luminosity upgrade , @xmath14 of sr",
    "is expected to hit the photon calorimeter at peak luminosity .",
    "consequently one has to either shield and upgrade the calorimeter or find some other method of measuring the luminosity .",
    "zeus decided to do both .",
    "the proposed and approved new luminosity system for zeus is shown in figure  [ global ] .    in this figure",
    "the photon rate is measured by two independent methods .",
    "first the upgraded old method ; a combination of two filters and two aerogel cerenkov counters is placed in front of the photon calorimeter in order to block the sr and correct for the photon energy loss in the filter .",
    "the calorimeter energy resolution depends on the accuracy of the energy loss correction performed .",
    "the photon pile - up problem though is not solved and certain corrections have to be performed in order to reduce the systematic error due to pile - up . the second and new method of measuring luminosity is the luminosity spectrometer which solves both the sr and pile - up problems by placing two small existing tungsten scintillator calorimeters away from the sr plane .",
    "the photon rate is measured indirectly by counting @xmath15 coincidences of photons converted in the photon pipe exit window ( about 10% ) .",
    "the spectrometer has small acceptance in coincidences @xmath16 and no acceptance in low energy photons , so that the probability of a pile - up photon coincidence is small .",
    "the major contribution in the total systematic error of this method is due to the error in the knowledge of the acceptance .",
    "the luminosity spectrometer consists of two well understood small ( @xmath17 ) tungsten scintillator calorimeters which provide the energy and position of the incident electron , and of a dipole magnet to separate the @xmath15 pair .",
    "the calorimeter ( former zeus beam pipe calorimeter bpc ) characteristics are listed in table  [ bpc ] .    0.1 in    .",
    "_ bpc characteristics .",
    "_ [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ summary ]    the counting , thermal @xmath18 background and proton - beam background errors are currently expected to be relatively low so they are not taken into account .",
    "the theoretical calculation of the cross section error was taken as @xmath12 .",
    "the total systematic error is calculated by summing all errors in quadrature .",
    "the total systematic error is expected to be below @xmath19 .",
    "the luminosity spectrometer method for measuring luminosity in the zeus experiment at hera was presented .",
    "zeus is measuring luminosity by counting photons produced by the bethe - heitler @xmath11 process .",
    "a 10% of these photons are converted in a thin exit window .",
    "the spectrometer measures the converted photon rate by counting @xmath20 coincidences in two small well understood calorimeters .",
    "the calorimeters are away from the sr plane and pile - up is a secondary effect .",
    "the spectrometer acceptance is measured using an independent device , the 6 m e - tagger . the tagger has almost 100% acceptance in b - h electrons in an energy window where the spectrometer acceptance is maximized .",
    "the electron and photon energy sum equals the electron beam energy ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "detailed calculations show that the luminosity spectrometer can measure luminosity with an accuracy better than 1.4%  @xcite ."
