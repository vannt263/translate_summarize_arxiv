    "the moduli of quadrilaterals and rings are some of the fundamental tools in geometric function theory , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to report on our experimental work on the numerical computation of the moduli of quadrilaterals , based on the algorithms and software of @xcite and motivated by the geometric considerations in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the methods considered here may be classified into two classes :    * methods based on the definition of the modulus and on conformal mapping of the quadrilateral onto a canonical rectangle , * methods based on the solution of the dirichlet - neumann problem for the laplace equation .    with the exception of a few special cases both methods lead to extensive numerical computation .",
    "for both classes of methods there are several options , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . among other things ,",
    "historical remarks are given in @xcite .",
    "we study the case of a polygonal quadrilateral and the way its modulus depends on the shape of the quadrilateral .",
    "following the approach of @xcite our main method is the adaptive finite element method afem of klas samuelsson and it belongs to class ( 2 ) .",
    "we compare this method to a method of class ( 1 ) , the schwarz - christoffel method of l.n .",
    "trefethen @xcite and its matlab implementation , the sc toolbox written by t.  driscoll @xcite .    in the two test cases we have used ,",
    "the performance of the sc toolbox was superior to afem .",
    "on the other hand , the afem software applies also to computation of moduli of polygonal ring domains as shown in @xcite .",
    "afem also has an advantage in the problems where the quadrilateral has a large number of vertices .",
    "this situation arises when approximating nonpolygonal quadrilaterals ( e.g. example [ hyprect ] ) .",
    "we will report our results also in @xcite .",
    "a jordan domain @xmath0 in @xmath1 with marked ( positively ordered ) points @xmath2 @xmath3 is a quadrilateral and denoted by @xmath4 we use the canonical map of this quadrilateral onto a rectangle @xmath5 , with the vertices corresponding , to define the modulus @xmath6 of a quadrilateral @xmath7 the modulus of @xmath8 is @xmath9    we mainly study the situation where the boundary of @xmath0 consists of the polygonal line segments through @xmath2 ( always positively oriented ) . in this case , the modulus is denoted by @xmath10 . if the boundary of @xmath0 consists of straight lines connecting the given boundary points , we omit the domain @xmath0 and denote the corresponding modulus simply by @xmath11 .    the following problem is known as the _ dirichlet - neumann problem_. let @xmath0 be a region in the complex plane whose boundary @xmath12 consists of a finite number of regular jordan curves , so that at every point , except possibly at finitely many points of the boundary , a normal is defined .",
    "let @xmath13 to be a real - valued continuous function defined on @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath14 where @xmath15 both are unions of jordan arcs . find a function @xmath16 satisfying the following conditions :    1 .",
    "@xmath16 is continuous and differentiable in @xmath17 .",
    "2 .   @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath19 denotes differentiation in the direction of the exterior normal , then @xmath20    one can express the modulus of a quadrilateral @xmath21 in terms of the solution of the dirichlet - neumann problem as follows .",
    "let @xmath22 be the arcs of @xmath12 between @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 respectively .",
    "if @xmath16 is the ( unique ) harmonic solution of the dirichlet - neumann problem with boundary values of @xmath16 equal to 0 on @xmath27 , equal to 1 on @xmath28 and with @xmath29 on @xmath30 then by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* /thm 4.5 ) : @xmath31 we also have the following connection to the modulus curve family ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the family of all curves joining @xmath27 and @xmath28 in @xmath0 .",
    "another approach is to use the _ schwarz - christoffel formula _ to approximate the conformal mapping @xmath34 onto the canonical rectangle .",
    "this formula gives an expression for a conformal map from the upper half - plane onto the interior of a @xmath35-gon .",
    "its vertices are denoted @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are the corresponding interior angles .",
    "the preimages of the vertices ( prevertices ) are denoted by @xmath38 .",
    "the schwarz - christoffel formula for the map @xmath34 is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a ( complex ) constant .",
    "the main difficulty in applying this formula is that the prevertices @xmath41 can not , in general , be solved for analytically . by using a mbius transformation , one may choose three of the prevertices arbitrarily .",
    "the remaining @xmath42 prevertices are then obtained by solving a system of nonlinear equations .",
    "several methods for solving this problem are discussed in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the matlab toolbox by t. driscoll @xcite contains a collection of algorithms for constructing schwarz - christoffel maps and computing the moduli of polygonal quadrilaterals .",
    "the toolbox also gives an estimate for the accuracy of the numerical approximation of the modulus .",
    "the solutions of the dirichlet and the dirichlet - neumann problems can be approximated by the method of finite elements , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "hence , this method can also be used to approximate the modulus of quadrilaterals and rings .",
    "the dirichlet - neumann problem can be numerically solved with afem ( adaptive fem ) numerical pde analysis package by klas samuelsson .",
    "this software applies , e.g. , to compute the modulus ( capacity ) of a bounded ring whose boundary components are broken lines .",
    "examples and applications for this software are given in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite a theoretical formula for computing @xmath43 was given with its implementation with mathematica .",
    "this led to a study of the modulus of quadrilateral in @xcite .",
    "in the course of the work on @xcite , the variation of the modulus was studied when one of the vertices varies and others are kept fixed , and several conjectures were formulated . for these purposes , neither the theoretical algorithm in @xcite nor the implemented mathematica program based on it was no longer adequate and we started to look for a robust program to compute @xmath44 it seems that the afem software of samuelsson is very efficient for this purpose .",
    "as in @xcite we use the afem software of samuelsson for computations involving moduli of polygonal quadrilaterals .",
    "we study the function @xmath50 an analytic expression for this function has been given in @xcite : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and the decreasing homeomorphism @xmath53 is defined by @xmath54 here @xmath55 is the _ gaussian hypergeometric function _ , @xmath56 is the _ shifted factorial function _ , and the _ elliptic integrals _",
    "@xmath57 are defined by @xmath58        the function @xmath60 is the modulus of the parallelogram with opposite sides @xmath61 and @xmath6 , respectively , and we see that there are three cases @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in the first case the function is monotone increasing with respect to @xmath65 , in the second case the function @xmath66 is constant and in the third case decreasing .",
    "[ mrem ] the modulus @xmath71 has an analytic expression if @xmath72 bowman @xcite ( see also @xcite ) gives a formula for the conformal modulus of the quadrilateral with vertices @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath61 when @xmath64 as @xmath76 where @xmath77 therefore , the quadrilateral can be conformally mapped onto the rectangle @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath75 , @xmath61 , with the vertices corresponding to each other .",
    "it is clear that @xmath80 the formula @xmath81 is given in @xcite .",
    "as far as we know there is neither an explicit nor asymptotic formula for the case when the angle @xmath82 of the trapezoid is equal to @xmath83 we compute the modulus @xmath84 by using the square frame capacity formula , afem and schwarz - christoffel toolbox .",
