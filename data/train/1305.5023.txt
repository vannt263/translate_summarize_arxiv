    "several wide - field surveys with large ground- and space - based telescopes will produce over a hundred million photometric data which are larger than spectroscopic data by two or three orders of magnitude .",
    "the most representative survey should be the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et  al .",
    "2000 ) , which greatly promotes the development of modern astronomy and improves the methods of analyzing massive astronomical data .",
    "many advanced data mining and machine learning algorithms ( see reviews written by zhang et  al . 2008 , borne 2009 and ball & brunner 2010 ) have been successfully applied to deal with problems caused by massive astronomical data sets , such as galaxy classification , quasar candidate selection , photometric redshift estimation and so on . in the next decade , the ongoing and planned multiband photometric surveys , for instance , the above mentioned sdss , the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ; lawrence et  al .",
    "2007 ) , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; tyson 2002 ) , the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs ; kaiser et  al . 2002 ) and so on , will bring many more challenges for astronomers .",
    "this situation will make the technologies of data mining and machine learning become more popular among the astronomical community .",
    "photometric redshifts are a very important and powerful statistical tool for providing distances of celestial objects to study the evolutionary properties of galaxies and cosmology .",
    "photometric redshifts are those derived from only images or photometry .",
    "so far the techniques of photometric redshifts have been in a bloom while deep multicolor photometric surveys have been carried out , with lots of objects inaccessible to spectroscopic observations or too time consuming with the available instruments .",
    "the techniques are divided into two types : empirical methods and the template - fitting approach .",
    "empirical methods use a subsample of the photometric data with spectroscopic redshifts as a training set for the redshift estimators , this subsample describes the redshift distribution in magnitude and color space empirically and is utilized to construct regressors to predict photometric redshifts .",
    "a lot of machine learning techniques show good performance on the problem of determining photometric redshifts of galaxies or quasars .",

    "this method will be used to determine the photometric redshifts of quasars which are much more challenging than those of galaxies because there is a catastrophic failure in estimating photometric redshifts of quasars when the spectroscopic redshift is less than 3 .",

    "2004 ; richards et  al .",

    "2004 ) . in the following",
    "we apply @xmath0-nearest neighbor with multiband data based on the sdss ( the sloan digital sky survey ) , ukidss ( the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ) and wise ( the wide - field infrared survey explorer ) databases to solve this problem .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 describes the characteristics of data used in this experiment in detail . in section  3.1",
    ", we present the principle of @xmath0nn , and discuss some detail of it .",
    "section  3.2 demonstrates the performance of @xmath0nn using multiband datasets for estimating photometric redshifts of quasars . in section  4 , we give the conclusion and what should be improved in the future work .",
    "there are three data sets used in this work .",
    "the first set is generated from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et  al .",
    "2000 ) which could be one of the most ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy . since we focus on the photometric redshift estimation of quasars , we use the samples of the quasar catalogue v ( schneider et  al .",
    "2010 ) with highly reliable redshifts as our basic data set . based upon the sdss dr7 ( abazajian et  al .",
    "2009 ) , quasar catalogue v contains 105,783 spectroscopically confirmed quasars and represents the conclusion of the sdss - i and sdss - ii quasar survey .",
    "we cross - identify all quasars in this table with the ukirt ( uk infrared telescope ) infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) ( warren et al .",
    "2000 ; lawrence et al . 2007 )",
    "data release eight ( dr8 ) and the whole data release of the nasa s wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; wright et al .",
    "2010 ) , respectively .    for the cross - matching of quasar catalogue v with ukidss dr7",
    ", we adopt the closest counterparts within 3 arcsec radius between the positions in the two catalogs . in order to avoid the area of lower galactic latitudes which is crowed with many stellar objects , we only adopt the data in the ukidss large area survey ( las ) ( wu et  al .",
    "2010 ) . in the left panel of figure",
    "[ fig : or ] , the distribution of the positional offset between sdss and ukidss is shown by a dotted line .",
    "it clearly shows that almost all ( 99.68% ) of the closest counterparts are within 0.5 arcsec of the sdss positions .",
    "we then cross - match quasar catalogue v with wise pre within 6 arcsec radius given that the angular resolution of wise is 6.1 arcsec , 6.4 arcsec , 6.5 arcsec and 12.0 arcsec in the four bands ( w1 , w2 , w3 , w4 ) , respectively . in the left panel of figure  1 , the positional offset distribution of the cross - match result of the two data sets is indicated by a solid line and it is found that 86.74% of the cross - match sources have offsets smaller than 1 arcsec and 95.57% of them have offsets smaller than 2 arcsec .         as a result , in order to improve the probability and reliability of cross - identification , the cross - match radius between sdss and ukidss dr8 is taken 0.5 arcsec , the radius between sdss and wise is set 2 arcsec .",
    "thus the number of quasars for the sdss - ukidss and sdss - wise samples is 25184 and 100208 , respectively . for the sdss - ukidss and sdss - wise samples obtained by the front steps ,",
    "the same sdss i d of sources are collected as the sdss - ukidss - wise sample .",
    "the number of this sample is 24089 .",
    "consequently , the number of sdss - ukidss - wise quasars is smaller than the other two quasar samples .    in the right panel of figure  1",
    ", we plot the redshift histogram of quasars for the four samples of sdss , sdss - ukidss , sdss - wise and sdss - ukidss - wise .",
    "the distributions of the sdss and sdss - wise samples are very similar , those of the sdss - ukidss and sdss - ukidss - wise samples are just alike . considering galactic extinction , magnitudes from sdss",
    "are corrected by the dust reddening map of schlegel et  al .",
    "since ukidss and wise surveys both use the vega magnitude system , we decide to convert dereddened sdss ab magnitudes to vega magnitudes using the rules described by hewett et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in the following experiments , @xmath3 all points to dereddened sdss @xmath3 in vega system , respectively .",
    "in pattern recognition , the @xmath0-nearest neighbor algorithm ( @xmath0nn ) is a simple method for classifying objects by the closest training examples in the feature space when data labels are discrete or for regressing objects based on the average of its nearest neighbors in the feature space when data labels are continuous .",
    "the solution is defined as follows : given a collection of data points and a query point in an @xmath4-dimensional feature space , find the data point closest to the query point .",
    "it is a type of instance - based learning , or lazy learning algorithm ( no explicit training step is required ) that has been shown to be very effective for a variety of problems in many fields .",
    "when @xmath0nn is used to estimate photometric redshifts , it simply assigns the property value of the unknown object to be the average of the spectral redshift values of its k nearest neighbors .",
    "sometimes it is helpful to weight points so that adjacent points contribute more to the predicted value than distant points .",
    "the main idea behind @xmath0nn is that similar training samples have similar output values , but it is sensitive to the local structure of the data .    in the field of machine learning",
    ", fast nearest neighbor search is a hot issue .",
    "given the high computational cost of @xmath0nn , the modern @xmath0nn normally works based on some data structure such as kd - tree or ball - tree .",
    "when the dimensionality of sample is less than 20 , kd - tree is a better choice for @xmath0nn .",
    "ball - tree is more suitable for high - dimensional problems and the brute force approach can be more efficient than a tree - based approach when dealing with small samples . for brute - force @xmath0nn , the distances between all pairs of points in the sample need to be computed during the neighbor search .",
    "apparently , brute - force neighbor searches are very appropriate for small samples .",
    "but while the number of samples increases , the brute - force approach ca nt work quickly . to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "various tree - based data structures have been proposed .",
    "the kd - tree data structure holds the points in a tree , which recursively splits the points into two groups along data axes and stops until one of the termination criteria is met .",
    "it is very fast to construct a kd - tree .",
    "although the kd - tree approach shows great efficiency in low - dimensional neighbors search , it becomes invalid while the dimension becomes very large due to so called  curse of dimensionality \" .",
    "based on this status , the ball - tree data structure was designed to enable fast nearest neighbor searching in high - dimensional spaces .",
    "the ball - tree is made up of a series of  balls \" and  nodes \" . in the ball - tree structure , the internal node ,",
    "a node within a node is differentiated by the region including all of its derivative balls .",
    "based on the spherical geometry of the ball - tree nodes , such trees might perform faster if they capture the true distribution of data in a high dimensional space . about the detailed introduction and comparison of brute force , kd - tree and ball - tree",
    "can refer to the web +  http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html \" .    for estimating photometric redshifts of quasars with multiband datasets , knn based on kd - tree should be the right choice .",
    "there is a small detail of @xmath0nn needed to be discussed that which kind of distance is the best measured method for determining photometric redshifts .",
    "actually , we have compared the performances of three kinds of distances ( euclidean , chebychev and cityblock ) used by @xmath0nn for quasar candidate selection ( peng et al .",
    "euclidean distance is the most common use of distance .",
    "when people talk about distance , this is what they are referring to .",
    "euclidean distance examines the root of square differences between the coordinates of a pair of objects .",
    "chebyshev distance ( i.e. the maximum value distance ) defined on a vector space where the distance between two vectors is the greatest of their differences along any coordinate dimension .",
    "in other words , it examines the absolute magnitude of the differences between the coordinates of a pair of objects .",
    "cityblock distance , also named manhattan distance , examines the absolute differences between the coordinates of a pair of objects .",
    "the performance of @xmath0nn has no obvious difference using different distance definition .",
    "we even try to use cosine distance to improve the performance of @xmath0nn for photometric redshift estimation but there is no sufficient evidence to prove which kind of distance is best suitable for our problem .",
    "therefore , in this work we use euclidean distance to find the @xmath0-nearest neighbor of the unknown object for determining photometric redshifts .    when using multiband data to estimate photometric redshifts of quasars , the input parameters of an algorithm are various magnitudes , colors and spectral redshifts .",
    "the algorithms try to find a mapping relationship between magnitudes , colors and spectral redshifts",
    ". then the redshifts of unknown objects can be measured by this relationship . for estimating photometric redshifts of quasars",
    ", there are two important evaluation indexes : the percents in different @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) intervals and the root mean square ( @xmath7 ) of @xmath8 which can be considered as accuracy and dispersion of predicted redshifts of @xmath0nn , respectively .",
    "since the photometric redshift estimation of quasars is much more difficult than that of galaxies , we not only consider the value of @xmath7 which is a statistical measure of the magnitude of a varying quantity , but also compute its accuracies in three @xmath8 regions in order to know the overall performance of a certain algorithm . in the following experiments ,",
    "we make use of the two evaluation indexes to compare the performances of @xmath0nn for determining photometric redshifts of quasars with various samples .      in this section",
    ", we compare the performances of @xmath0nn using the samples of sdss , sdss - ukidss , sdss - wise and sdss - ukidss - wise with different input patterns , respectively .",
    "in addition , we separately analyze the sdss - ukidss , sdss - wise and sdss - ukidss - wise samples , only using sdss features just like that has been done by ball et  al .",
    "( 2007 ; 2008 ) .",
    "considering poor performance of estimating photometric redshifts of quasars only using sdss optical band data , we utilize multiband data from optical to infrared band to improve it .",
    "many authors ( ball et  al .",
    "2007 ; bovy et  al . 2011 ; way et al .",
    "2009 ; wu et  al .",
    "2010 ) have successfully used multiband data to get better performance of photometric redshift estimation of galaxies or quasars . in this subsection ,",
    "the four datasets ( the sdss sample , the sdss - ukidss sample , the sdss - wise sample and the sdss - ukidss - wise sample ) from three sky surveys are used to evaluate the performance of @xmath0nn for phorometric redshift estimation of quasars .",
    "when @xmath0nn are employed for photometric redshift estimation , the known samples are randomly divided into a third and two - thirds for ten times , two - thirds for training and a third for testing .",
    "therefore the experiment performs ten times for each input pattern .",
    "there are various parameter combination from different datasets . which is the best input pattern ?",
    "this is a difficult question to answer for it is different for different samples with different algorithms .",
    "moreover , it has different model parameters to adjust for the same algorithm . only when the algorithm and its model parameters as well as the test data are set is the best input pattern fixed . as a result",
    ", the @xmath0 value of @xmath0nn is firstly set as 1 in the following experiments .",
    "thus it is easy to find good input pattern for the same data and algorithm . in the second step ,",
    "we try to find the best @xmath0 value when the input pattern is set for a special data sample .",
    "firstly , we investigate the solution of determining photometric redshifts with just the sdss optical band . in the dissertation of kumar ( 2008 ) , he used artificial neural networks ( anns ) to estimate photometric redshifts with several different sdss input patterns ( parameter combinations ) . from those experiments described in that dissertation",
    ", it showed that the performance using five @xmath9 magnitudes is very similar to that of four @xmath10 colors ( @xmath10 , hereafter short for @xmath11 ) .",
    "if these features were combined together , there is a very little improvement on the performance of annz for photometric redshift estimation of quasars . in table 1",
    ", we redo these experiments with @xmath0nn and get the same conclusions .",
    "in addition , the pattern of the four colors with @xmath12 or @xmath13 magnitude is tried .",
    "the experimental result indicates that the performance of @xmath0nn increases when the input pattern @xmath14 or @xmath15 is considered , compared to the results with @xmath11 , @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "the performance with @xmath14 is a little better than that with @xmath15 .",
    ".comparison of the performances of the nearest neighbor method ( @xmath18 ) on different samples and different input patterns .",
    "@xmath19 ; @xmath20 ; @xmath21 ; @xmath22 ; @xmath23 ; @xmath24 ; @xmath25 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have demonstrated a simple and useful method @xmath0-nearest neighbor using multiband data which can effectively estimate photometric redshifts of quasars . according to the above experiments and the comparison with other algorithms",
    ", @xmath0nn can be taken as a powerful tool to determine photometric redshifts of quasars , when it use @xmath26 and ( @xmath27 ) as the input pattern .",
    "on the sdss - ukidss - wise data set , the accuracy within @xmath28 can reaches @xmath29 , @xmath30 within @xmath31 , @xmath32 within @xmath33 and @xmath7 is @xmath34 .",
    "this method successfully avoids the redshift catastrophic failure when the genuine redshift of quasar is below 2.8 .",
    "actually , @xmath0nn can reach the same level of performance only using cross - match data from the sdss and ukidss databases , but @xmath7 is a little higher ( 0.115 ) . adding information from the wise infrared band",
    "can effectively improve the performance of @xmath0nn on @xmath7 .",
    "finally , we improve the performance of @xmath0nn within @xmath33 from 85.19% to about 98.97% and reduce @xmath7 from 0.287 to 0.009 .",
    "this means that @xmath0nn using multiband data is an effective and feasible approach for estimating photometric redshifts of quasars .",
    "the major advantages of @xmath0nn are its simplicity and easy understanding without physical assumption .",
    "it does not require training , takes the known spectroscopic redshifts as templates and further shows its superiority with large numbers of spectra available .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0nn approach combined with kd - tree conquers the high time - consumption faced by traditional @xmath0nn method .    in the future ,",
    "the main target is about how to improve the accuracy of photometric redshifts on @xmath28 . without doubt",
    ", using multibands is a useful and reliable way to improve it and we plan to add ultraviolet band data from galex to test this method .",
    "another possible solution is about that @xmath0nn can be combined with some classification method to conquer the catastrophic failure area on the sdss optical band that is met by many machine learning algorithms .",
    "the work of photometric redshift estimation on optical band is important and urgent because the overlapped area among the several surveys are relatively small and there is over billion of unknown objects with photometric data",
    ". we will implement it for predicting the photometric redshifts of quasar candidates for the guoshoujing telescope ( lamost ) or other projects in the world .",

    "<S> @xmath0nn arrives at the best performance when @xmath0 is different with a special input pattern for a special dataset . </S>",
    "<S> the best result belongs to the sdss - ukidss - wise sample . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results show that generally the more information from more bands , the better performance of photometric redshift estimation with @xmath0nn . the results also demonstrate that @xmath0nn using multiband data can effectively solve the catastrophic failure of photometric redshift estimation , which is met by many machine learning methods . by comparing the performance of various methods for photometric redshift estimation of quasars , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0nn based on kd - tree shows its superiority with the best accuracy for our case . </S>"
