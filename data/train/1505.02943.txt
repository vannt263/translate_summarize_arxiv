    "we can immediately obtain that the second term in @xmath41 is 0 . on the other hand , because of the no shift in pess , either @xmath47 or @xmath48 will be 0 due to the parity symmetry.@xcite as a result , the last @xmath34 term is also 0 for raman scattering .",
    "hence , one could notice that the last term in @xmath34 may correspond to the second term in @xmath41 .",
    "it is well known that the case can be realized in the non totally symmetric vibrations.@xcite for such kind of vibrations , there always exists at least one symmetric operator that makes the geometries of @xmath49 to be identity and then @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the reason of @xmath0 term has no contribution to the _",
    "non_-resonant raman intensity of non totally symmetric vibrations is the orthogonality of vibrational wavefunctions between ground and excited states rather than the orthogonality of two vibrational wavefunctions in the ground state .",
    "the former reason is exactly the same as that for the selection rule in resonant raman processes.@xcite it is worth to note that this conclusion can also be generalized to resonant raman intensities as well as general pess ( such as double well@xcite ) of excited states .    to further confirm the corresponding relationship between the last term in @xmath34 and the second term in @xmath41 ,",
    "the condition of @xmath50 should be enforced . in the framework of linear coupling model ( lcm)@xcite where it assumes @xmath51 ,",
    "both terms can be calculated analytically and give the same result , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath52 when @xmath53 , this result is equal to @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the huang - rhys factor@xcite .",
    "we should emphasis that the current treatment is consistent with ting s work@xcite which could be traced back to shorygin s treatment@xcite in 1947 .",
    "however , ting s work was restricted to the lcm scheme and the vibronic coupling ( the @xmath1 term ) has not been included.@xcite moreover , ting s algorithm was only widely applied in the two - state model@xcite and intrinsically pre - resonant conditions@xcite . in off - resonance conditions , ting s a term",
    "was usually considered to be very small and negligible.@xcite    when going beyond the lcm , with the help of the general sum rules for franck - condon integrals,@xcite we could obtain that the last term in @xmath34 and the second term in @xmath41 both equal to @xmath56 we have further performed numerical calculations for more general condition of @xmath50 . the considered displaced harmonic model is shown in fig .  [ fig : model ] .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , both terms give the same value of @xmath60 in the unit of @xmath61 .",
    "the analytical and perfect numerical agreement not only confirm the equivalence of the two terms but also show that , for modes with @xmath50 , the @xmath0 term can have non - zero contribution to the _",
    "non_-resonant raman intensity .",
    "note that , here the corresponding @xmath55 is around 0.4,@xcite which is reasonable for realistic molecules . because the @xmath8 is arbitrary in above discussions , a state to state relationship between albrecht s theory and perturbation method",
    "is thus established for _",
    "non_-resonant raman spectrum .",
    "it is worth to mention that , in the original work of albrecht , a similar relationship has also been discussed .",
    "however , it only focused on the case of near - resonance conditions ( see eq .  22 in ref .  ) .",
    "time - dependent frame of raman theory has the advantage of avoiding the sum - over - states of @xmath12 in albrecht s theory.@xcite instead , the dynamics of the wave packet given by the initial vibrational wave function times the corresponding electronic transition dipole on the excited states is involved.@xcite mathematically , the equivalence of these two representations could be readily proven by a simple half - fourier transform.@xcite in time frame , the `` dynamic '' and `` static '' terms are equivalent to the albrecht s @xmath0 and @xmath1 terms , respectively .",
    "here , the `` dynamic '' term arises from wave packet propagation on the born - oppenheimer surfaces , while , the `` static '' term comes from the coordinate dependence of the electronic transition dipole.@xcite in other words , the first and second terms in the taylor expansion of transition dipole , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath62 , associate with the `` dynamic '' and `` static '' terms , respectively .    in _ non_-resonant conditions , the short time approximation holds .",
    "thus , in the zero - frequency limit , the time average polarizability associated with @xmath8 could be calculated as@xcite @xmath63 where the per - factor @xmath64 arises from the zero - frequency limit , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the vibrational hamiltonian for @xmath8 , the damping factor is omitted , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 is the average energy on @xmath8 .",
    "if the assumption@xcite @xmath71 is adopted , the `` dynamic '' term in eq .  [ eq : apq - s ] would be @xmath72 where @xmath73 . as a result ,",
    "the `` dynamic '' term ( the @xmath0 term ) of the stokes peaks at fundamental frequencies also vanishes in the time frame due to the orthogonality of the vibrational wavefunctions in the ground state . on the other hand ,",
    "the `` static '' terms survives and its value in the first order of @xmath21 is exactly equal to @xmath1 term in eq .",
    "[ eq : ar ] if we considered @xmath74 ( see appendix b in ref .   for details ) .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with that in ref .  , where the emphasis for far from resonance is solely on the `` static '' term .",
    "the reason of the vanishing of `` dynamic '' term in _ non_-resonance in the time frame would be easily located as the assumption of eq .",
    "[ eq : hr - t ] , which is equivalent to the assumption of @xmath27 in the energy frame .",
    "both assumptions neglect the vibrational contributions in excited states . to obtain the correct result , in the time frame , eq .",

    "<S> the raman intensity can be well described by the famous albrecht equation that consists of @xmath0 and @xmath1 terms . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the contribution from albrecht s @xmath0 term can be neglected without loss of accuracy for far off - resonant raman scattering processes . however , as demonstrated in this study , we have found that this widely accepted long - standing assumption fails drastically for totally symmetric vibration modes of molecules in general off - resonant raman scattering . perturbed first principles calculations for water molecule show that strong constructive interference between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 terms occurs for the raman intensity of the symmetric o - h stretching mode , which can account for about 40% of the total intensity . meanwhile , a minor destructive interference is found for the angle bending mode . </S>",
    "<S> the state to state mapping between the albrecht s theory and the perturbation theory allows us to verify the accuracy of the widely employed perturbation method for the dynamic / resonant raman intensities . </S>",
    "<S> the model calculations rationalized from water molecule with the bending mode show that the perturbation method is a good approximation only when the absolute energy difference between the first excited state and the incident light is more than five times of the vibrational energy in ground state . </S>"
