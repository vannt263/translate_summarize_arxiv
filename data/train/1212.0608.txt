    "oxygen octahedral rotations can have a significant impact on the behavior of abo@xmath0 perovskites , affecting electronic , dielectric , ferroelectric and magnetic properties .",
    "for example , the octahedral rotations couple strongly with the magnetic structure in transition - metal perovskites by modifying the metal - oxygen - metal bond angles that are critical to determine the magnetic interactions.@xcite in some materials , such as srtio@xmath0 , the oxygen rotations give rise to a non - polar antiferrodistortive ( afd ) ground state contribute to the suppression of ferroelectric ( fe ) order.@xcite . however , the recent discovery of rotation - driven improper ferroelectricity in a superlattice  @xcite has inspired a search for this type of ferroelectricity in other types of materials .",
    "@xcite because they can also couple with magnetic properties , octahedra rotations offer a promising approach to the discovery or design of new multiferroic perovskites .",
    "@xcite    in the cubic structure ,  and  both show an afd instability at the zone corner ( @xmath1 point ) of the brillouin zone.@xcite following this instability leads to the experimentally observed tetragonal ground state with rotations along the [ 001 ] axis for , while  prefers rotations along the [ 111 ] axis . for , however , this is not the equilibrium structure ; instead , a strong fe instability at @xmath2 out - competes the afd instability , giving rise to a tetragonal fe ground state without rotations .",
    "nevertheless , the afd modes provide a potential source of instability in , as has been predicted for example for surface  @xcite and interface  @xcite geometries .",
    "( in , a weak fe instability at @xmath2 is found in some calculations , depending sensitively on lattice constant and other details",
    ". however , experimentally the material just barely avoids this instability , remaining paraelectric down to zero temperature . )    while oxygen octahedral rotations clearly play an important role in these and other perovskites , and while they are known to be strongly affected by stress  @xcite and temperature,@xcite we are not aware of any previous study of the effects of _ electric _ fields on the afd rotations . in this paper",
    ", we study the phase transition behavior of the afd modes in  and   under three - dimensional constant electric displacement field .    of course ,  and  are qualitatively different in that the latter is ferroelectric while the former remains paraelectric down to zero temperature .",
    "however , the choice of fixed electric displacement field @xmath3 for the boundary conditions in this study allows us to treat both materials on an equal footing .",
    "the situation would have been much more complicated if we had chosen to work at fixed electric field @xmath4 , because the energy landscape is multivalued and the paraelectric configuration is unstable at small @xmath4 in a ferroelectric material like . at fixed @xmath3",
    ", however , the energy landscape remains single - valued , thus allowing access to the entire electric equation of state for  as well as .@xcite indeed , both materials have a large static dielectric constant , so that mapping at fixed @xmath3 is qualitatively similar to mapping at fixed @xmath5 .",
    "thus , in our study , the main qualitative difference between  and  will be related to the fact that the rotational instability that prefers to develop along a [ 001 ] axis in  instead prefers a [ 111 ] axis in .",

    "in order to explore the octahedral - rotation phase diagram in the space of @xmath3 fields , the internal energy @xmath6 has to be calculated and minimized on a three - dimensional mesh of @xmath3 values .",
    "near the phase boundaries between different rotational phases , this process would be quite tedious ; the first - principles calculations would need to be very carefully converged , and the procedure would become quite time - consuming .",
    "we therefore introduce a landau - devonshire model to study the phase transitions in this system , with the coefficients in the model being obtained from fitting to our first - principles results on a smaller database of @xmath3 values .",
    "this model can then be used to locate the phase boundaries efficiently .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the dominant afd rotational instabilities for paraelectric  and  are both at the @xmath1 point in the brillouin zone ( corresponding , in the most general case , to the @xmath7 glazer notation ) .",

    "we expected these ellipses to shrink and disappear with a further increase of @xmath23 , but in fact this happens only very slowly ; along the line @xmath100 , the rotations survive to quite large values of @xmath3 , as is confirmed by the first - principles calculations upon which the model is based .",

    "the situation is simpler for the rotational phase diagram of .",
    "the phase diagrams for several snapshots at increasing @xmath23 are shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : sto ] wherever possible .",
    "when @xmath23=0 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : pto](a ) , the center point ( @xmath3=0 ) is in the @xmath42 phase .",
    "the surrounding area enclosed by the solid lines ( green ) is triclinic except along the [ 100 ] and [ 110 ] symmetry lines , which are @xmath101 ( lines with circles , red ) and @xmath87 ( dashed lines , red ) respectively .",
    "the transition is continuous across the latter , but first - order across the former .",
    "essentially , at small three - dimensional @xmath3 , the system prefers to be in a slightly perturbed version of one of four @xmath42 phases , depending on the octant in which @xmath3 resides .",
    "using the notation @xmath102 denotes the octant with @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , etc .",

    "the planes @xmath99=0 , @xmath90=0 , and @xmath23=0 thus form first - order boundaries in this small-@xmath3 region , appearing as solid lines ( labeled with circles , red ) in the 2d plots .",
    "it follows that the octahedral rotation can be `` switched '' between these @xmath42-like ( actually , triclinic ) phases by a small change of external electric displacement field .",
    "the area between the inner ( green ) and outer ( blue ) solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : pto](a ) is the @xmath117 phase , which becomes @xmath95 along [ 110 ] directions ( short - dashed - dotted lines , brown ) and @xmath80 along [ 100 ] direction ( dotted lines , black ) .",
    "the inner solid ( green ) lines thus represent second - order phase boundaries at which @xmath118 as one passes to the outside .    as was the case for , the high - symmetry phases for pto  in fig .",
    "[ fig : pto](a ) become lower - symmetry phases as @xmath23 increases , figs .",
    "[ fig : pto](b - c ) .",
    "in fact , as soon as @xmath119 , the entire region inside the solid ( blue ) boundary is generically triclinic .",
    "special cases occur along the dashed lines ( red ) , where the symmetry is   or , and along the dashed - dotted lines ( green ) , which is . when @xmath23 is small enough , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : pto](b ) , the first - order phase boundaries mentioned above are still visible as the solid lines with squares ( magenta ) near the origin , corresponding to the @xmath95 phase , but with increasing @xmath23 these shrink and then vanish , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pto](c ) . the solid ( blue ) boundary ,",
    "outside which the rotational phases disappear , can also be seen to shrink with increasing @xmath23 , at first slowly and then more rapidly , and to disappear by the time @xmath23 reaches 0.10a.u .",
    "there are quite significant differences between the rotational phase diagrams for  and , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : sto ] and  [ fig : pto ] . at small @xmath3",
    ", the major differences arise from the fact that the @xmath3=0 ground states are different , namely @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "thus , small applied @xmath3 fields essentially switch the system between @xmath41-like phases in , or between @xmath42-like phases in .",
    "as @xmath3 gets larger , the behavior becomes rather complex , but we can identify an important difference that can be traced back to the parameter values of the model .",
    "namely , we notice a much more isotropic behavior of the outer boundary at which the rotations disappear in  compared to . in , for example",
    ", we find that the critical magnitude of @xmath73 at which the rotations disappear is @xmath1200.09a.u .  and",
    "@xmath1200.07a.u .  in the [ 100 ] and [ 111 ] @xmath3-space directions respectively . for ,",
    "on the other hand , the corresponding values are @xmath1200.14 and @xmath1200.40a.u .  respectively .",
    "in addition to being larger ( reflecting the stronger tendency to rotational instability in ) , the anisotropy between [ 100 ] and [ 111 ] directions is very much greater , with rotations extending much further in @xmath3 space along the [ 111 ] direction .",
    "this can be understood from the coefficients reported in table i. restricting ourselves to the case of @xmath32 and @xmath121 , the critical displacement @xmath122 can be obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq : u ] as @xmath123 . from this",
    "we obtain @xmath124=0.34 and 0.07a.u .  for  and  respectively .",
    "the greatly enhanced anisotropy and large value of @xmath122 along this [ 111 ] direction can thus be traced to the small value of the denominator @xmath125 for .",
    "it is useful to put the above results in perspective regarding the dielectric behavior .",
    "is known experimentally to remain paraelectric down to 0k , so that the entire space of @xmath3-fields should be accessible by varying an applied @xmath4 field , even if the dielectric constant is very large .",
    ", on the other hand , is strongly ferroelectric , so that the region of small @xmath3 corresponds physically to the saddle point of the multi - well energy landscape .",
    "this internal - energy landscaped as a function of @xmath3 ( without octahedral rotations ) was mapped out in our previous work  @xcite , where the spontaneously polarized tetragonal ground state occurs at @xmath126}|=0.17 $ ] a.u .",
    "similarly , the spontaneously polarized states with constrained orthorhombic and rhombohedral symmetry occur at @xmath127}|$]=0.15 a.u .  and",
    "@xmath128}|$]=0.14 a.u.respectively .",
    "so , we can roughly think of this as a three - dimensional `` mexican hat '' potential with a radius of @xmath1200.15a.u . in comparison , the results presented above show that the octahedra rotations disappear for @xmath129 a.u .  and @xmath127}>0.11 $ ] a.u .",
    "thus , the entire region of the interesting rotational phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pto ] lies inside the mexican - hat radius , in the region where the crystal is unstable under fixed @xmath4 ( but not under fixed @xmath3 ) electric boundary conditions .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the phase transitions associated with oxygen octahedral rotations in  and  as a function of a three - dimensional applied electric displacement field , first directly from first - principles calculations and then also using a fitted landau - devonshire model . for , the @xmath3=0 ground state is tetragonal , with degenerate states corresponding to the rotation angle lying along one of the three cartesian axes , and for small @xmath3-vectors the ground state is a weakly perturbed version of one of these states .",
    "similarly , for , the @xmath3=0 ground state is rhombohedral , with four degenerate states having rotation axis in one of the [ 111 ] or related directions , and again a small @xmath3 selects and weakly perturbs one of these states .",
    "however , as the strength of @xmath3 is increased , we find a quite complicated phase diagram for each material , with both first- and second - order phase boundaries appearing in different parts of the diagram .",
    "the structure is especially rich for the case of . for both materials , the general state associated with generic @xmath77",
    "is triclinic , but states with higher symmetry tend to arise when @xmath3 itself has higher symmetry . in both materials ,",
    "the rotations eventually disappear at sufficiently large values of applied @xmath3 .",
    "our work represents one of the first attempts to carry out a systematic three - dimensional characterization of the interplay between polar and octahedral - rotation degrees of freedom in perovskites of this class .",
    "while there is no external field that couples directly to the rotational degrees of freedom , so that is very difficult to find ways of controlling the rotations directly , the present work suggests that such control should be possible indirectly via the application of appropriate electric fields . in any case",
    ", the observed richness of behavior suggests that there may be much more to learn in other materials of this class and in more distantly related materials .",
