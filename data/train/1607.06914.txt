    "in the communication through asymmetric channels , it is necessary to use codewords with a biased code - symbol distribution maximizing the mutual information between the input and the output to achieve the capacity .",
    "it is well known that biased codewords can be generated from an auxiliary code over an extended alphabet based on gallager s nonlinear mapping @xcite , but its complexity becomes very large when the target distribution is not expressed in a simple rational number .",
    "a promising solution to this problem is to use a dual of lossless coding where the encoding and the decoding are inverted . since a lossless code converts a biased sequence into an almost uniform compressed sequence , it is natural to expect that a decoder of a lossless code can be used to generate a biased codeword .",
    "this framework is first considered in the literature of ldpc codes @xcite@xcite and a similar idea is also proposed in polar codes @xcite . in these schemes fixed - length lossless ( ldpc or polar ) codes are used to generate a biased codeword . a similar scheme based on a fixed - length random number generator",
    "is also found in @xcite .",
    "whereas such a fixed - length lossless code ( or a fixed - length random number generator ) is convenient for theoretical analyses , it is well known that variable - length lossless code such as an arithmetic code practically achieves the almost optimal performance .",
    "thus , it is natural to replace such fixed - length lossless codes with variable - length ones .",
    "in fact , coding schemes based on ldpc codes @xcite@xcite and polar codes @xcite where fixed - length lossless coding is replaced with arithmetic coding have been proposed in the context of lossy source coding , which can be regarded as a dual of channel coding .",
    "nevertheless , a naive use of an arithmetic decoder can not be used as a generator of a biased codeword in channel coding . to see this ,",
    "let us consider the code tree in fig .",
    "[ tree_arithmetic ] of shannon - fano - elias code ( sfe code , see , e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.9 ) for detail ) for @xmath0 i.i.d .  from @xmath1 .",
    "as we can see from the figure , the code tree of an arithmetic code is generally not complete and can not be used as a generator of a sequence over @xmath2 from a binary sequence .",
    "for example , the decoder of this code gets `` confused '' if it receives sequence 0111 since such a sequence never appears as ( a prefix of ) a codeword of this code .",
    "it is theoretically possible to consider a modified sfe code where the redundant edges are removed as in fig .",
    "[ tree_arithmetic2 ] .",
    "however it is very difficult to realize such a code with a linear complexity because the code tree is practically not stored in the memory and it is necessary to compute many other codewords to find redundant edges .    furthermore , even if a modified sfe code without redundant edges is realized , such a code is still not appropriate as a generator of a biased sequence .",
    "for example in the code tree of fig .",
    "[ tree_arithmetic2 ] , sequence 0101 is converted into @xmath3 and therefore @xmath3 appears with probability @xmath4 which is roughly 2.5 times larger than the target probability @xmath5 .",
    "such a problem generally occurs because there sometimes exists a large gap between target probabilities between adjacent sequences under the lexicographic order as in @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "however , sorting of sequences ( as in shannon - fano code ) is not practical since the linear - time computability of the cumulative distribution is lost .",
    "homophonic coding is another candidate for a generator of biased codewords .",
    "this is a framework to convert a sequence with distribution @xmath8 reversibly into another sequence with the target distribution @xmath9 . in particular , a homophonic code",
    "is called _ perfect _ if the generated sequence exactly follows the target distribution @xmath9 .",
    "hoshi and han @xcite proposed a fixed - to - variable ( fv ) length perfect homophonic coding scheme based on an interval algorithm similar to a random number generator @xcite .",
    "this code is applied to generation of biased codewords in @xcite@xcite but these fv channel codes suffer the following problem for practical use .",
    "when we use an fv homophonic code to generate a biased codeword with block length @xmath10 , an @xmath11-bit message is sometimes converted into one block of codeword and is converted into two blocks another time .",
    "thus , if a decoding error occurred in one block then the receiver can no more know where the codeword is separated for each @xmath11-bit message and the decoding error propagates to all the subsequent sequences . based on this observation",
    "it is desirable to use a variable - to - fixed ( vf ) length homophonic coding scheme for a component of a channel code .",
    "although it is difficult to realize a perfect vf homophonic code , we can relax the problem when we consider application to channel coding .",
    "since homophonic coding is first considered in the context of cryptography @xcite , the target distribution @xmath9 is usually uniform and there is a special meaning to be perfect , that is , the output is exactly random . on the other hand in application to channel coding , the output codeword does not have to perfectly follow the target distribution and it suffices to assure that a bad codeword does not appear too frequently .    keeping this difference of application in mind",
    ", we propose a new vf homophonic code , dual sfeg code .",
    "this code corresponds to a dual of a modified sfe code based on gray code @xcite@xcite , which we call sfeg code . in sfeg code",
    ", the cumulative distribution is defined according to the order induced by gray code instead of the lexicographic order . under this order we can assure linear - time computability of the cumulative distribution and a small gap of probabilities between adjacent sequences .",
    "based on this property we prove that the dual sfeg code is asymptotically perfect and its coding rate is also asymptotically optimal .",
    "we also prove as a by - product that sfeg code for lossless compression achieves a better coding rate than the original sfe code .",
    "we use superscript @xmath10 to denote an @xmath10-bit sequence such as @xmath12 for some alphabet @xmath13 .",
