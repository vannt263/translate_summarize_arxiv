    "there is now overwhelming evidence that sgr  a *  is a supermassive black hole at the center of the milky way .",
    "many stars are observed to orbit about a common focal position , requiring an unseen mass of @xmath7  m@xmath8  contained within a radius of less than 100  au @xcite , for a distance to the center of 8.0  kpc @xcite .",
    "accurate registration of the infrared and radio reference frames @xcite reveal that the common orbital focal position is coincident with sgr  a *  to within measurement uncertainty of @xmath9  mas .",
    "finally , the absence of intrinsic motion of sgr  a *  at levels near that expected for a @xmath10  m@xmath8  object @xcite , coupled with a size less than  1  au @xcite , provide a lower limit on mass density of @xmath11  m@xmath8  pc@xmath12 , which is only two orders of magnitude less than the density of a @xmath10  m@xmath8  non - rotating black hole within its innermost stable orbit .",
    "there can now be little doubt that sgr  a *  is a supermassive black hole .",
    "@xcite present measurements of the position of sgr  a *  relative to a compact extragalactic radio source ( j1745@xmath132820 , also refered to as j1745 - 283 in earlier publications ) .",
    "these measurements were conducted with the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba ) over a period of @xmath14 at a wavelength of @xmath0 ( @xmath15 ) and have been used to determine the apparent proper motion of sgr  a*. over time scales of months or longer , sgr  a * s _ apparent _ motion is dominated by the effects of the orbit of the sun about the center of the galaxy .",
    "the component of the sun s orbit in the galactic plane is uncertain at roughly the 10% level , and this limits estimation of any intrinsic motion of sgr  a *  at about the @xmath16  km  s@xmath17  level . however , the component of the motion of the sun out of the galactic plane is known to high accuracy [ @xmath18  km  s@xmath17  toward the north galactic pole ; @xcite ] . after removing the effects of the sun s motion ,",
    "the residual motion of sgr  a *  perpendicular to the galactic plane is very small , @xmath19 , as expected for a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at the dynamical center of the galaxy . while previous work concentrated on the long - term motion of sgr  a * , here we analyze its short - term position `` wander '' on time scales of hours to weeks .",
    "short - timescale motion of the centroid position of sgr  a*would be expected if a portion of the emission comes from material orbiting about the smbh .",
    "the degree of centroid variability would necessarily depend upon the brightness of the orbiting material , the degree to which its emission is nonuniform , and the orbital radius dominating the total flux .",
    "we use a simple hot - spot model to relate the constraint from the observed short - term position wander of sgr  a *  (  [ oocm ] ) to a constraint upon the presence of strong inhomogeneities in the accretion flow onto the smbh as a function of hot - spot luminosity and orbital period (  [ constraints ] ) . finally , concluding remarks are contained in  [ c ] .",
    "@xcite describe the observations and data calibration methods in detail .",
    "briefly , we obtained position data as follows : the vlba antennas switched between sgr  a *  and a compact extragalactic source ( j1745@xmath132820 ) every 15 seconds in order provide interferometer phase differences rapidly enough to cancel the effects of short term atmospheric fluctuations .",
    "the stronger source , sgr  a * , was used as the phase reference to calibrate data from the weaker source , j1745@xmath132820 .",
    "astrometric imaging of sgr  a *  at 7-mm wavelength is best accomplished with only the five inner - vlba antennas ( fd , kp , la , ov and pt ) .",
    "these antennas produce interferometer baselines with lengths of up to @xmath20  km , resulting in synthesized beams typically about @xmath21  mas ( fwhm ) elongated north - south .",
    "longer baselines ( e.g.  involving the washington ( br ) and iowa ( nl ) state antennas ) are not generally useful for precise astrometry , as it is difficult to detect sgr  a *  with the 8-sec on - source integrations afforded by rapid switching , coupled with low fringe visibilities on long baselines owing to the large , scatter - broadened , image of sgr  a*. also , the sources are mutually visible with the inner five antennas for only a short time period for antennas far from the inner ones .    our most accurate astrometry was obtained with atmospheric path - delay calibration using `` geodetic '' blocks @xcite .",
    "this involves short periods of observations of quasars with a wide spanned - bandwidth and scheduled to deliver a wide range of source elevations .",
    "these geodetic blocks were placed before the start , at the middle , and after the end of the sgr  a *   observations .",
    "analysis of these data yield estimates of the zenith atmospheric path - delay at each antenna accurate to @xmath22 to 1  cm ( or about 1 wavelength ) .      for analysis of short - term wander , we selected only our highest quality data , requiring both high accuracy atmospheric path - delay calibration using geodetic blocks ( which was started in 2003 ) and data from all five inner - vlba antennas .",
    "data from vlba programs br84 on 2003 april 5 and 25 and br124 on 2007 april 5 and 11 satisfied these requirements .",
    "the position wander of sgr  a *  over time scales of hours was determined by dividing the calibrated interferometer data into hourly bins .",
    "the data were fourier transformed to make images and intensity centroid positions were determined . in practice , we measured the background source , j1745@xmath132820 , which had been phase - referenced to sgr  a * , but we interpret any position changes as owing to changes in sgr  a*. in fig .  [ hourly_positions ] we show the east - west ( ew ) position offsets as a function of greenwich sidereal time , after removing an average position for each day s data .",
    "the north - south ( ns ) positions are intrinsically less accurate by a factor of about 3 , as the ns projections of the interferometer baselines are correspondingly shorter than the ew projections .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "possible reasons for position wander include intrinsic variations in the position of the emitting plasma ( e.g. , variations in the accretion flow or perhaps in a jet ) or extrinsic processes such as refractive interstellar scattering .",
    "sgr  a *  is observed to be diffractively scattered to a size of @xmath23  mas , where @xmath24 is the observing wavelength .",
    "flux density fluctuations are modest and decrease in strength with increasing wavelength ; thus strong refractive scintillations are not indicated @xcite .",
    "any refractive position wander should be @xmath25 and should occur on time scales @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the distance and @xmath28 is the transverse velocity of the scattering `` screen '' relative to the observer @xcite . for @xmath29",
    "kpc @xcite and @xmath30  km  s@xmath17 , characteristic of material in the inner @xmath31  pc of the galaxy where large scattering sizes are observed , the refractive time scale is @xmath32  hours .",
    "thus , we would not expect a significant contribution to the short - term wander of sgr  a *  from refractive scattering . for comparison , @xcite , using vlbi observations of the sgr  b2(n ) h@xmath33o  masers near the galactic center ,",
    "find a wander limit of @xmath34 over timescales of months for maser spots , which are diffractively scattered to a comparable size ( at 22 ghz ) as sgr  a *  ( at 43 ghz ) .",
    "of course , our results provide an observation limit to any refractive position wander .",
    "since extrinsic sources of position wander ( scattering ) are unlikely to be dominant , we now discuss the implications for intrinsic wander from variations in brightness within an accretion disk given in  [ constraints ] .",
    "our observations of the lack of short - term wander of the centroid position of sgr  a *  presented in ",
    "[ section : hours ] give an upper limit of @xmath35 for time scales of @xmath36 hours .",
    "this translates to an upper limit on the wander versus orbital period plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : drs ] as indicated by the horizontal red line and hatched region .",
    "( in the very unlikely event that the accretion disk inclination is both near @xmath37 and oriented nearly north - south on the sky , we would need to use our ns limits , which are a factor of three weaker . )",
    "our ew limit is below the dotted blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig : drs ] , which is for hot spot flux density dominating over disk ( or possible jet ) emission , for orbital periods exceeding 120  min ( corresponding to orbital radii larger than @xmath5 for @xmath38 m@xmath8 ) . for cases in which the hot spot flux density is weaker than that of the disk , somewhat longer",
    "periods are allowed .",
    "for example , for @xmath39 , orbital periods longer than 5  hr are excluded .    in practice ,",
    "the limits placed by current @xmath0 vlbi are significantly weaker .",
    "the limited sensitivity to hot spots on compact orbits is primarily due to two reasons : ( 1 ) `` long '' integration times ( @xmath40 ) average much of the short time variability out , and ( 2 ) the opacity of the accretion flow itself makes it difficult to view hot - spots on compact orbits at @xmath0 . the integration time is limited by the sensitivity issues and the small number of antennas yielding interferometer baselines @xmath41  km afforded by the current vlba ; higher bandwidth recording in the future should help alleviate this problem .",
    "the optical depth is a property of sgr a * itself , and can only be addressed by observations at shorter wavelengths .",
    "however , even in the absence of an optically thick accretion flow , it is not possible to increase the centroid variability by more than an order of magnitude due to the intrinsically small orbital radii , as seen by comparing the blue and green limits in the lower - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : drs ] .",
    "nevertheless , high - resolution astrometry is reaching sensitivities and resolutions sufficient to begin to test the hot - spot model for bright sgr a * flares .",
    "unfortunately , the typical fractional variability at @xmath0 during our observations was roughly @xmath42 , implying that significant improvement in positional accuracy will be required to constrain such events .",
    "since the observed centroid wander is consistent with systematic errors , owing predominantly to centimeter - scale errors in the modeling of the atmospheric path - delays , substantially increasing accuracy will require better calibration techniques .",
    "however , for the somewhat rare instances in which the spot is substantially brighter @xcite , the vlba at 7 , or possibly 3 ,  mm wavelength appears poised to provide significant limits upon the existence and morphology of inhomogeneities in the accretion flow surrounding sgr  a*.    ultimately , observations at @xmath43  mm wavelength with vlbi techniques or at infrared wavelengths with an instrument like gravity @xcite may be necessary to image the region within @xmath44 schwarzschild radii on the short time scales needed to test the hot - spot model ."
