    "matarrese et al . ( 1997 ) developed an algorithm to describe the clustering in our past light - cone , where the non - linear dynamics of the dark matter distribution and the redshift evolution of the bias factor are taken into account ( see also moscardini et al .",
    "1998 , 1999a , b and suto et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the observed spatial correlation function @xmath1 in a given redshift interval @xmath2 is given by the exact expression @xmath3 ^ 2 } \\ ; , \\label{eq : xifund}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the correlation function of pairs of objects at redshifts @xmath5 and @xmath6 with comoving separation @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the actual redshift distribution of the catalogue .",
    "an accurate approximation for @xmath9 over the scales considered here is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the dark matter covariance function and @xmath12 is an intermediate redshift between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the effective bias @xmath13 appearing in the previous equation can be expressed as a weighted average of the ` monochromatic ' bias factor @xmath14 of objects of some given intrinsic property @xmath15 ( like mass , luminosity , ... ) , as follows @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of objects actually present in the catalogue with redshift in the range @xmath18 and @xmath15 in the range @xmath19 , whose integral over @xmath20 is @xmath8 . in our analysis of the two - point correlation function for x - ray",
    "selected clusters we will use for @xmath8 in eq.([eq : xifund ] ) the observed one , while in the theoretical calculation of the effective bias we will take the @xmath17 predicted by the model described below .",
    "this phenomenological approach is self - consistent , in that our theoretical model for @xmath17 will be required to reproduce the observed cluster abundance and their @xmath21@xmath22 relation .    for the cluster population",
    "it is extremely reasonable to assume that structures on a given mass scale are formed by the hierarchical merging of smaller mass units ; for this reason we can consider clusters as being fully characterized at each redshift by the mass @xmath15 of their hosting dark matter haloes . in this way their comoving mass function can be computed using an approach derived from the press - schechter technique .",
    "moreover , it is possible to adopt for the monochromatic bias @xmath14 the expression which holds for virialized dark matter haloes ( e.g. mo & white 1996 ) .",
    "recently , a number of authors have shown that the press - schechter relation does not provide an accurate description of the halo abundance both in the large and small - mass tails .",
    "also , the simple mo & white ( 1996 ) bias formula has been shown not to correctly reproduce the correlation of low mass haloes in numerical simulations .",
    "we adopt the relations recently introduced by sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) , which have been shown to produce an accurate fit of the distribution of the halo populations in the gif simulations .",
    "the last ingredient entering in our computation of the correlation function is the redshift evolution of the dark matter covariance function @xmath11 .",
    "we use an accurate analytical method to evolve @xmath11 into the fully non - linear regime .",
    "in particular , we use the fitting formula given by peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) .    in order to predict the abundance and clustering of x - ray selected clusters in flux limited surveys we need to relate x - ray cluster fluxes into a corresponding halo mass at each redshift .",
    "the given band flux @xmath23 corresponds to an x - ray luminosity @xmath24 in the same band , where @xmath25 is the luminosity distance . to convert @xmath26 into the total luminosity @xmath27 we perform band and bolometric corrections by means of a raymond - smith code , where an overall icm metallicity of @xmath28 times solar is assumed .",
    "we translate the cluster bolometric luminosity into a temperature , adopting the empirical relation @xmath29 , where the temperature is expressed in kev and @xmath27 is in units of @xmath30 erg s@xmath31 . in the following analysis",
    "we assume @xmath32 and @xmath33 ; these values allow a good representation of the local data for temperatures larger than @xmath34 kev .",
    "moreover , even if observational data are consistent with no evolution in the @xmath35 relation out to @xmath36 , a redshift evolution described by the parameter @xmath37 has been introduced to reproduce the observed @xmath21@xmath38 relation ( rosati et al .",
    "1998 ; de grandi et al . 1999 ) in the range @xmath39 .    finally , with the standard assumption of virial isothermal gas distribution and spherical collapse , it is possible to convert the cluster temperature into the mass of the hosting dark matter halo ( see e.g. eke et al .",
    "we applied our method to different flux - limited surveys . here",
    "we show only the results obtained for the rass1 bright sample ( de grandi et al . 1999 ) and for the xbacs catalogue ( ebeling et al .",
    "the application to other surveys ( bcs , reflex and possible future space missions ) is presented in moscardini et al .",
    "( 1999b ) .",
    "the rass1 bright sample contains 130 clusters of galaxies selected from the first processing of the @xmath40 all - sky survey ( rass1 ) data .",
    "this sample was constructed as part of an eso key programme aimed at surveying all southern rass candidates , which is now known as the reflex cluster survey .",
    "the rass1 bright sample is count - rate - limited in the @xmath40 hard band ( 0.5  2.0 kev ) , so that due to the distribution of galactic absorption its effective flux limit varies between 3.05 and @xmath41 erg @xmath42 s@xmath31 over the selected area .",
    "this covers a region of approximately 2.5 sr within the southern galactic cap . in figure",
    "[ fi : theor ] we compare our predictions for the rass1 spatial correlation function in different cosmological models to the observational estimes .",
    "moscardini et al .",
    "( 1999a ) find that the two - point correlation function @xmath43 of the rass1 bright sample is well fitted by the power - law @xmath44 , with @xmath45 mpc and @xmath46 ( 95.4 per cent confidence level with one fitting parameter ) .",
    "we considered five models , all normalized to reproduce the local cluster abundance ( eke et al .",
    "1996 ) and belonging to the general class of cold dark matter ( cdm ) models ( the first three are einstein - de sitter models ) : a standard cdm ( scdm ) model ; the so - called @xmath47cdm model ; a tilted model ( tcdm ) , with spectral index @xmath48 and with a high ( 10 per cent ) baryonic content ; an open cdm model ( ocdm ) , with matter density parameter @xmath0 and a low - density flat cdm model ( @xmath49cdm ) , with @xmath50 .",
    "all the einstein - de sitter models here considered predict too small an amplitude .",
    "their correlation lengths are smaller than the observational results : we find @xmath51 mpc for scdm , tcdm and @xmath52 , respectively . on the contrary , both the ocdm and @xmath49cdm models are in much better agreement with the data and their predictions are always inside the 1-@xmath53 errorbars ( @xmath54 mpc , respectively ) .",
    "the xbacs catalogue is an all - sky x - ray sample of 242 abell galaxy clusters extracted from the rosat all - sky survey data .",
    "being optically selected , it is not a complete flux - limited catalogue .",
    "the sample covers high galactic latitudes ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the adopted limiting flux is @xmath56 erg @xmath42 s@xmath31 in the 0.12.4 kev band . due to the aforementioned selection effects ,",
    "the xbacs luminosity function @xmath57 in the faint part is much lower than that obtained from other catalogues . using a redshift evolution of the temperature - luminosity relation",
    ", we forced our models to be consistent with the number counts .",
    "for this reason we have to introduce in the models for xbacs its incompleteness @xmath58 , defined as the ratio between its luminosity function @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which is a combination of the results for rdcs at low @xmath61 ( rosati et al .",
    "1998 ) and for bcs at high @xmath61 ( ebeling et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the clustering properties of this catalogue have been studied by different authors .",
    "abadi et al . ( 1998 ) found that @xmath43 can be fitted by the usual power - law relation with @xmath62 and @xmath63 mpc ( errorbars are 1 @xmath53 ) .",
    "borgani et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who adopted an analytical approximation to the bootstrap errors , found @xmath64 and a slightly larger value of @xmath65 mpc ( errorbars in this case are 2-@xmath53 uncertainties ) .",
    "figure  [ fi : xbacs ] compares these observational estimates to the theoretical predictions of the cosmological models previously introduced .",
    "again we find that all einstein - de sitter models display too a small clustering .",
    "their correlation lengths are smaller than the observational results : we find @xmath66 mpc for scdm , tcdm and @xmath52 , respectively . on the contrary ,",
    "both the ocdm and @xmath49cdm models give very similar results and are in better agreement with the observational data ( @xmath67 mpc ) .",
    "we believe that the method presented here leads to robust predictions on the clustering of x - ray selected galaxy clusters .",
