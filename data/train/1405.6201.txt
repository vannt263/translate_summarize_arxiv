    ", the force - constant matrix is directly calculated in real - space by considering the proportionality between the atomic displacements and forces when the former are sufficiently small .",
    "large supercells must then be constructed in order to guarantee that the elements of the force - constant matrix have all fallen off to negligible values at their boundaries , a condition that follows from the use of periodic boundary conditions . in the present work , we employed simulation boxes larger than @xmath5 atoms and dense @xmath6-point grids in the calculation of the atomic forces with vasp .",
    "computation of the nonlocal parts of the pseudopotential contributions was performed in reciprocal , rather than real , space .",
    "once the force - constant matrix is thus obtained , we can fourier transform it to obtain the phonon spectrum at any @xmath7 point .",
    "this step was done with the phon code due to alf  [ ] . in using this code , we exploited the translational invariance of the system to impose the three acoustic branches to be exactly zero at the @xmath7 point , and used central differences in the atomic forces ( i.e. , we considered positive and negative atomic displacements ) .",
    "we must note , however , that convergence of the force - constant matrix elements with respect to the size of the supercell in ionic materials may be slow due to the appearance of charge dipoles and macroscopic electric fields in the limit of zero wave vector .",
    "fortunately , long - range dipole - dipole interactions can be modeled at the harmonic level from knowledge of the atomic born effective charge tensors and the dielectric tensor of the material  [ ] .",
    "taking advantage of this result , wang _ et al .",
    "_ proposed a mixed - space approach in which accurate force constants are calculated with the direct approach in real space and long - range dipole - dipole interactions with linear response theory in reciprocal space  [ ] . in the present work , we used wang _",

    "the agreement between our measurements and calculations is good ( i.e. , within the @xmath10  % of difference ) , especially in what concerns the variation of the raman frequency with pressure which is found to be almost constant and equal to @xmath11  @xmath12/gpa in the experiments and @xmath13  @xmath12/gpa in the simulations .",

    "comprehensive one - phase @xmath21 molecular dynamics simulations were carried out in order to compute the @xmath22 and @xmath23 phase boundaries in caf@xmath0 as a function of pressure .",
    "calculations comprised large simulation boxes and long simulation times of up to @xmath24  ps .",
    "we systematically carried out simulations at temperature intervals of @xmath25  k , from @xmath26 up to @xmath27  k , at each considered volume .",
    "following previous works  [ ] , we performed comprehensive @xmath16 two - phase coexistence md simulations in order to determine the melting curve of caf@xmath0 at low and high pressures .",
    "starting with a supercell containing the perfect crystal structure ( i.e. either cubic fluorite or orthorhombic @xmath28 ) , we thermalize it at a temperature slightly below the expected melting temperature for about @xmath29  ps . the system remains in a superionic state . the simulation is then halted and the positions of the atoms in one half of the supercell are held fixed while the other half is heated up to a very high temperature ( typically five times the expected melting temperature ) for about @xmath29  ps , so that it melts completely . with the fixed atoms still fixed , the molten part is rethermalized to the expected melting temperature ( for about @xmath30  ps ) . finally ,",
    "the fixed atoms are released , thermal velocities are assigned , and the whole system is allowed to evolve freely at constant @xmath16 for a long time ( normally more than @xmath31  ps ) , so that the solid and liquid come into equilibrium .",
    "the system is monitored by calculating the average number of particles in slices of the cell taken parallel to the boundary between the solid and liquid . with this protocol ,",
    "there is a certain amount of trial and error to find the overall volume which yields the coexisting solid and liquid system .",
    "an example of a successful coexistence run is shown in the supplemental fig .",
    "we calculated the formation energy of frenkel pair defects ( fpd ) in cubic caf@xmath0 at different pressures .",
    "we used a simulation box containing @xmath32 atoms and a @xmath33 monkhorst - pack @xmath6-point grid for integrations within the first brillouin zone .",
    "we found that the series of calculated energies ( see the supplemental fig .  [ fig4 ] ) could be very well fitted to the power law function @xmath34 where the optimal values of the parameters are @xmath35  ev , @xmath36  ev and @xmath37 .",

    "the solid line represents a numerical fit to the series of computed points ( see text ) . ]",
    "our crystal structure searches performed in compressed caf@xmath0 relied on two different strategies , namely ( i )  comprehensive atomic relaxations of configurations generated in constrained low-@xmath2 aimd runs , and ( ii )  enthalpy calculation of phases that have been recently observed and predicted in isomorphic ab@xmath0 compounds under pressure",
    ".    in our restricted low-@xmath2 aimd runs , we used a small simulation cell containing @xmath38 atoms in the orthorhombic @xmath28 phase and set the temperature to ambient conditions . consistently to the observed @xmath39 transition , we constrained the ca@xmath40 cations not to move during the dynamical simulations .",
    "the total duration of these aimd runs was @xmath41  ps .",
    "once these simulations were finished , we randomly selected @xmath42 configurations out of @xmath43 and performed atomic and crystal cell relaxations in them . during the geometry optimizations all cations and anions were allowed to move .",
    "subsequently , we identified the crystal symmetry of the final equilibrium structures with the isotropy package  [ ] . following this strategy",
    ", we obtained the five candidate high-@xmath2 crystal phases that we mention in the main text of the present letter ( i.e. , orthorhombic @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and monoclinic @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath3 ) .",
    "we also computed the energy of the post - cotunnite @xmath48 and @xmath49 phases in caf@xmath0 under pressure .",
    "these phases have been recently observed and predicted in bulk auin@xmath0 and auga@xmath0 respectively  [ ] , which are isomorphic materials to caf@xmath0 . by following this strategy ,",
