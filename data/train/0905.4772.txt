    "the observation of the supernovae of type ia @xcite provides the evidence that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion . combining the observations from cosmic background radiation @xcite and sdss @xcite , one concludes that the universe at present is dominated by @xmath2 exotic component , dubbed dark energy , which has negative pressure and pushes the universe to accelerated expansion .",
    "of course , a natural explanation to the accelerated expansion is due to a positive tiny cosmological constant .",
    "though , it suffers the so - called _ fine tuning _ and _ cosmic coincidence _ problems .",
    "however , in @xmath3 confidence level , it fits the observations very well @xcite . if the cosmological constant is not a real constant but is time variable , the fine tuning and cosmic coincidence problems can be removed .",
    "in fact , this possibility was considered in the past years .",
    "in particular , the dynamic vacuum energy density based on holographic principle are investigated extensively @xcite . according to the holographic principle",
    ", the number of degrees of freedom in a bounded system should be finite and has relations with the area of its boundary . by applying the principle to cosmology ,",
    "one can obtain the upper bound of the entropy contained in the universe . for a system with size @xmath4 and uv cut - off @xmath5 without decaying into a black hole ,",
    "it is required that the total energy in a region of size @xmath4 should not exceed the mass of a black hole of the same size , thus @xmath6 .",
    "the largest @xmath4 allowed is the one saturating this inequality , thus @xmath7 , where @xmath0 is a numerical constant and @xmath8 is the reduced planck mass @xmath9 .",
    "it just means a _ duality _ between uv cut - off and ir cut - off .",
    "the uv cut - off is related to the vacuum energy , and ir cut - off is related to the large scale of the universe , for example hubble horizon , future event horizon or particle horizon as discussed by @xcite . the holographic dark energy in brans - dicke theory is also studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the standard and brans - dicke holographic dark energy models when the hubble horizon is taken as the role of ir cut - off , non - accelerated expansion universe can be achieved @xcite . however , the hubble horizon is the most natural cosmological length scale , how to realize an accelerated expansion by using it as an ir cut - off will be interesting .",
    "in fact , an accelerated expansion universe has been realized in the holographic case when the model parameter @xmath0 is time variable @xcite .",
    "as known , for any nonzero value of the cosmological constant @xmath5 , a natural length scale and time scale @xmath10 can be introduced into the einstein s theory .",
    "reversely , a cosmological length scale and time scale may introduce a cosmological constant or vacuum energy density into einstein s theory .",
    "of course , the important is how to choose a proper cosmological length scale or time scale to obtain a tiny cosmological constant or vacuum energy density .",
    "honestly , we have not the first physical principle to determine the length or time scale .",
    "but , one can immediately relate these length or time scales to the biggest natural scales , for example hubble horizon , particle horizon and future event horizon etc . because the under - researched system is the universe , for a cosmological length scale @xmath11 , one has @xmath12 when the length scale is time variable , a time variable cosmological constant can be obtained . inspired by this observation , one can consider time variable cosmological constant from this analogue and let alone the holographic principle .",
    "the important is that with this analogue an accelerated expansion will be obtained when the hubble horizon is taken as a cosmological length scale .",
    "if the other cosmological length scales , for examples future event horizon and particle horizon , are put in , a time variable tiny cosmological constant and an accelerated expansion universe will be obtained . in this paper",
    ", we will explore these possibilities . for their explicit relations with the cosmological length scales , _",
    "i.e. _ cosmological horizons , we dub them _ horizon cosmological constants _ as contrasts to the _ holographic cosmological constants _",
    "for time scale case , a time variable cosmological constant has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : tvc ] , we give a brief review of time variable cosmological constant . in section [ sec : hhl ] , [ sec : feh ] and [ sec : phl ] , hubble horizon , future event horizon and particle horizon will be considered as cosmological length scale respectively and their corresponding time variable cosmological constants are discussed .",
    "we will discuss their evolutions in section [ sec : evolution ] .",
    "conclusions are set in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "the einstein s equations with a cosmological constant can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the energy - momentum tensor of ordinary matter and radiation .",
    "this equation can be obtained via the variation of the cosmological constant contained einstein - hilbert action with respect to @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath16 . and the result does not depend on the cosmological constant is time and space variable or not . from the bianchi identity ,",
    "one has the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath17 , it follows necessarily that @xmath5 is a fixed constant .",
    "if the cosmological constant permeates smoothly the whole universe and is only time variable , say @xmath18 , one can move the cosmological constant to the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ee ] ) and takes @xmath19 as the total energy - momentum tensor . once again to preserve the bianchi identity or local energy - momentum conservation law , @xmath20 , one has , in a spacially flat frw universe , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the energy density of time variable cosmological constant and its equation of state is @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the equation of state of ordinary matter , for the cold dark matter @xmath25 .",
    "it is natural to consider interactions between variable cosmological constant and dark matter @xcite , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : conservation ] ) . after introducing an interaction term @xmath26",
    ", one has @xmath27 and the total energy - momentum conservation equation @xmath28 for a time variable cosmological constant , the equality @xmath29 still holds .",
    "immediately , one has the interaction term @xmath30 which is different from the interactions between dark matter and dark energy considered in the literatures @xcite where a general interacting form @xmath31 is put by hand .",
    "with observation to eq .",
    "( [ eq : rholambda ] ) , the interaction term @xmath26 can be moved to the left hand side of the equation , and one has the effective pressure of the time variable cosmological constant - dark energy @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the effective dark energy pressure .",
    "also , one can define the effective equation of state of dark energy @xmath34 obviously , when @xmath5 is a fixed constant , the effective interaction term @xmath26 becomes zero . then the @xmath5cdm universe is recovered .",
    "the friedmann equation as usual can be written as , in a spacially flat frw universe , @xmath35",
    "in fact , horvat has considered this possibility from holographic principle @xcite , where the hubble horizon @xmath36 was taken as a cosmological length scale . when hubble horizon @xmath36 is chosen , one obtains a time variable cosmological constant @xmath37 which is just the one considered by horvat @xcite , where @xmath0 is a constant .",
    "as known , our universe is filled with dark matter and dark energy and deviates from a de sitter one .",
    "just to describe this gap , the constant @xmath0 is introduced .",
    "it can be seen that a @xmath38 constant is expected under the consideration of the energy budget of our universe and the de sitter universe will be recovered when @xmath39 .",
    "now , the corresponding vacuum energy density can be written as @xmath40 which has the same form as the so - called holographic dark energy which is based on holographic principle . with this vacuum energy , the friedmann equation ( [ eq : fe ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath41 to protect a positive dark matter energy density , a constraint @xmath42 is required .",
    "immediately , a scaling solution is obtained @xmath43 substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : conservation ] ) , one has @xmath44 here , one can see a rather different result on @xmath45 from the standard evolution @xmath46 . in this case , the deceleration parameter becomes @xmath47 to obtain a current accelerated expansion universe , i.e. @xmath48 , and to protect positivity of dark matter energy density , one obtains a constraint to the constant @xmath0 @xmath49 the effective equation of state of vacuum energy density is @xmath50 under the constraint eq.([eq : cconstraint ] ) , one can see that a quintessence like dark energy is obtained .",
    "this is tremendous different from holographic dark energy model where non - accelerated expansion universe can be achieved when the hubble horizon taken as the ir cut - off @xcite . also , it is easily that the de sitter universe will be recovered when @xmath39 .",
    "once the constant @xmath0 deviates from @xmath39 , a scaling solution will be obtained .",
    "it is clear that the properties of horizon cosmological constant depend on the value of the model parameter @xmath0 .",
    "but , it can not describe the whole evolution of our universe for the lack of transition from decelerated expansion to accelerated expansion . with a fixed constant @xmath0 ,",
    "the deceleration parameter @xmath51 is also a fixed constant .",
    "so , it will be not a variable dark energy model when the hubble horizon as a cosmological length scale .",
    "however , it can be remedied by treating @xmath0 a no fixed constant @xcite .",
    "so , other candidates to the cosmological length scale would be chosen .",
    "the future event horizon is defined as @xmath52 which is the boundary of the volume a fixed observer may eventually observe . taking it as the role of cosmological length scale ,",
    "one has the vacuum energy density @xmath53 via the definition of the dimensionless energy densities @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the friedmann equation is rewritten as @xmath56 the energy conservation equation ( [ eq : conservation ] ) becomes @xmath57 where @xmath58 . combining eq .",
    "( [ eq : eh ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ehvv ] ) and the definition of the dimensionless energy density @xmath59 , one has @xmath60 taking the derivative with respect to @xmath58 from the both sides of the above equation ( [ eq : integral ] ) , one has the differential equation @xmath61 substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffh ] ) into above differential equation ( [ eq : hdx ] ) , one obtains the differential equation of @xmath59 @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath58 . this equation describes the evolution of the dimensionless energy density of dark energy .",
    "clearly , one can see that this equation is different from the corresponding one derived in @xcite for its different form .",
    "given the initial conditions @xmath64 , the evolution of the horizontal cosmological constant will be obtained .",
    "once the values of @xmath0 and @xmath64 are fixed , @xmath59 , as a function of @xmath65 or redshift @xmath66 , describes the evolution of the dark energy completely .",
    "in fact , the model parameter @xmath0 can be determined by the cosmic observations such as sn ia , bao and cmb shift parameter @xmath67 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eeos ] ) , it is easy to obtain the effective equation of state of dark energy @xmath68 it is in the range of @xmath69 , when one notices the dark energy density ratio @xmath70 .",
    "the form of the effective equation of state of the horizon cosmological constant is the same as the one of holographic dark energy .",
    "however , for the differences of the evolution of @xmath59 , its behaviors will be different from the holographic one .",
    "the deceleration parameter can be easily derived @xmath71 to have an current accelerated expansion of the universe , @xmath72 is required .",
    "in this part , we will consider another possible candidate to the cosmological length scale - the particle horizon which is defined as @xmath73 it is the length scale that a particle can pass from the beginning of the universe . in this case , the vacuum energy density is given as @xmath74 repeating the analysis and calculations as done in [ sec : feh ] , one has the differential equation of @xmath59 @xmath75 where @xmath63 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath58 .",
    "the effective equation of state and deceleration parameter , which are the same as that of the future event horizon case , are given as @xmath76 in terms of redshift @xmath66 , the evolution equation ( [ eq : pheq ] ) can be recast into @xmath77 as known , the dimensionless parameter of @xmath78 decreases with the redshift @xmath66 .",
    "so , the required condition will be @xmath79 .",
    "then one has the constraint to the expression @xmath80 . by simple calculation",
    ", one has @xmath81 which is a strong constraint and requires @xmath1 always . comparing the result that current value of @xmath59 is @xmath82",
    ", one can conclude that particle horizon case can not give a viable cosmological model .",
    "now , it is proper to discuss the evolutions of horizon cosmological constants . here",
    ", we just discuss the evolutions of effective equation of state and dimensionless energy density . in the holographic dark energy model ,",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath0 determines the property of holographic dark energy . when @xmath83 , @xmath39 and @xmath38 in the case of the event horizon as an ir cut - off , the holographic dark energy behaves like quintessence , cosmological constant and phantom respectively . in our cases , there are some differences and common grounds . in the hubble horizon",
    "cosmological constant case , the effective equation of state of time variable cosmological constant is always quintessence like or true constant when the value of @xmath0 is @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "however , in the corresponding holographic case , non - accelerated expansion universe can be obtained when hubble horizon as an ir cut - off . in the future event horizon case ,",
    "the behaviors of effective equation of state determined by @xmath0 are the same as that of the holographic ones , however the evolutions are different .",
    "we have plotted the evolutions of the effective equation of state and dimensionless energy density with respect to the redshift @xmath66 in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution ] where different values of model parameter @xmath0 are adopted .",

    "for example , let @xmath84 and @xmath85 , one has the transition redshift @xmath90 .",
    "in fact , the model parameters @xmath0 and @xmath64 can be fixed by fitting current cosmic observations @xcite .",
    "the evolutions of deceleration parameter are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qzevolution ] .     with respect to the redshift @xmath66 , where the values @xmath84 , @xmath85 ( dashed lines ) , @xmath86 ( dotted lines ) are adopted.,width=288 ]",
    "in this paper , time variable cosmological constants , dubbed _ horizon cosmological constants _ , as analogues to the fact that a de sitter cosmological boundary corresponds to a positive cosmological constant , are explored .",
    "the horizon cosmological constants correspond to hubble horizon , future event horizon and particle horizon are discussed respectively .",
    "when the hubble horizon is taken as a cosmological length scale , the effective equation of state of horizon cosmological constant @xmath91 is quintessence like . in this case , the deceleration parameter @xmath92 is negative when @xmath93 , i.e. an accelerated expansion universe is obtained .",
    "that is tremendous different from the holographic dark energy model in einstein gravity theory and brans - dicke theory where non - accelerated expansion universe can exist when the hubble horizon as an ir cut - off .",
    "it also can be seen that , once the constant @xmath39 , the de sitter universe will be recovered . however , with a fixed constant @xmath0",
    ", the deceleration parameter @xmath51 is also a fixed constant .",
    "so , it will be not a variable dark energy model when the hubble horizon as a cosmological length scale for the lack of transition from decelerated expansion to accelerated expansion .",
    "but , it can be remedied by treating @xmath0 a no fixed constant .",
    "so , other candidates to the cosmological length scale would be chosen and checked . when particle horizon is taken as the cosmological length scale",
