    "extensions of the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) with an additional anomaly - free gauged @xmath0 symmetry broken at the tev scale are arguably some of the most well - motivated candidates for new physics ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "such symmetries are theoretically motivated , as they represent the simplest augmentations of the sm gauge sector and are ubiquitous within string and/or grand unified theories . while the phenomenology of such @xmath9 gauge bosons depends on the details of the couplings of the @xmath9 to the sm fermions ,",
    "current limits from direct and indirect searches indicate typical lower bounds of order @xmath10 gev on the @xmath9 mass and an upper bound of @xmath11 on the @xmath12 mixing angle @xcite . for a reasonable range of couplings , the presence of such tev scale @xmath9 bosons",
    "should be easily discernable at present and forthcoming colliders such as the tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .    within the context of supersymmetric theories , a plethora of @xmath0 models",
    "have been proposed , including scenarios motivated by grand unified theories ( guts ) such as @xmath13 and @xmath1 and scenarios motivated from string compactifications of heterotic and/or type ii theories ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "recent models also include scenarios in which the @xmath0 mediates supersymmetry breaking @xcite , plays a role in the generation of neutrino masses @xcite and/or spontaneous @xmath14-parity violation @xcite , or provides a portal to a hidden / secluded sector ( for reviews , see  @xcite ) .",
    "though the details of the @xmath0 charge assignments are model - dependent , generically the cancellation of @xmath0 anomalies requires an enlargement of the matter content to include sm exotics and sm singlets with nontrivial @xmath0 charges . in these theories",
    ", the sm singlets also typically play an important role in triggering the low - scale breaking of the @xmath0 gauge symmetry .    in most models of this type ,",
    "the @xmath0 charges of the quarks and leptons are family universal . though this feature is desirable for the first and second generations due to the strong constraints from flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) , there is still room for departures from family universality for the charges of the third generation .",
    "in fact , this often occurs in string constructions if the families result from different embeddings ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , though many of the results from the @xmath15 factories have indicated a strong degree of consistency with the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) predictions of the sm , there are hints of non - sm fcnc patterns within the @xmath5 transitions for both @xmath16 and @xmath17 processes at the level of a few standard deviations @xcite . of the many options for new physics models that can explain this discrepancy , family non - universal @xmath0 models are interesting in that they are theoretically well - motivated scenarios that lead to tree - level fcnc , as opposed to scenarios in which the new physics contributions are loop - suppressed  @xcite .",
    "a recent model - independent analysis of @xmath9-mediated fcnc in the @xmath5 transitions showed that this general framework can accommodate the data @xcite .",
    "( related analyses include @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is optimal to consider the bounds on specific family non - universal @xmath0 models in addition to the fully model - independent results .    our purpose in this paper is to construct and analyze supersymmetric anomaly - free family non - universal @xmath18 models ( which we will denote as nussm models ) .",
    "our strategy in building this class of nussm models is to exploit the well - known fact that in @xmath1 models , there are two options for embedding the down quarks and lepton doublets in the @xmath19 representation of @xmath2 , which is related to the fact that the down - type higgs and the lepton doublets have the same gauge quantum numbers . by choosing one embedding for the first and second generations and the alternative embedding for the third generation",
    ", we can obtain anomaly - free models in which the additional family non - universal @xmath0 is given by a particular linear combination of the usual @xmath20 and @xmath21 of @xmath1-inspired models .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "we begin by outlining our basic procedure and presenting the resulting classes of anomaly - free family non - universal @xmath0 models . in the following section ,",
    "we analyze the gauge symmetry breaking and comment on general features of the mass spectrum .",
    "we next turn to an analysis of the implications of these models for fcnc in the @xmath22 transitions , then provide our concluding remarks .",
    "[ table1 ]    in @xmath0 models , the cancellation of gauge anomalies generally implies that additional fermions are present in the theory ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) . to motivate the presence of these additional fermions and construct simple anomaly - free family non - universal models ,",
    "our approach is to exploit the properties of @xmath1 embeddings of the sm fermions and higgs fields in grand unified theories .",
    "recall that in @xmath1 models , the sm particles are embedded in the fundamental @xmath4 representations .",
    "with respect to the two - step breaking scheme of @xmath1 to its @xmath13 and @xmath2 subgroups @xmath23 the @xmath4 has the decomposition @xmath24 with respect to the representations of @xmath13 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "hence , the @xmath4 has two @xmath19 multiplets ; these representations are used to embed the down - type @xmath25-singlet quarks with the lepton doublets and exotic @xmath25-singlet quarks with down - type higgs doublets . a standard choice for model - building is to have the down - type quarks and lepton doublets of all three sm families in the @xmath19 of the @xmath26 , though models with the sm down - type quarks and lepton doublets in the other @xmath19 have also been considered in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we will assign the down - type quark singlets and lepton doublets of the first and second generations to be in the @xmath19 of the @xmath26 , and the associated particles of the third generation to be in the @xmath19 of the @xmath27 , as shown in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the matter content of these theories thus includes the following fields : ( i ) the sm first and second families @xmath28 , higgs plus exotic fields @xmath29 , and singlets @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is a family index ) , and ( ii ) the sm third family @xmath32 , higgs and exotics @xmath33 , and singlet @xmath34 .",
    "the higgs sector of the theory thus generically has multiple higgs doublets and singlets beyond those of the mssm . from an incomplete @xmath35  @xcite . ]",
    "the additional family non - universal @xmath0 in these nussm models is then a linear combination of the @xmath21 and the @xmath20 gauge groups : @xmath36 ( the assumption is that the orthogonal linear combination of @xmath21 and @xmath20 is either absent or broken at a high scale )",

    "the @xmath18 gauge boson couplings to the up - type quarks vanish  @xcite .",
    "hence , the production of the associated @xmath9 boson is suppressed at hadron colliders .",
    "this is especially the case at the tevatron , since in high - energy @xmath41 collisions the @xmath42 production via down quarks is suppressed by an order of magnitude relative to up quarks  @xcite .",
    "* @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "this symmetry is motivated by models with a secluded @xmath18 breaking sector and a large supersymmetry breaking @xmath45-term that have ( 1 ) an approximately flat potential that results in an appropriate @xmath46@xmath42 mass hierarchy  @xcite ; ( 2 ) a strong first order electroweak phase transition and large spontaneous cp - violation , which can result in viable electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "while we use the @xmath1 framework to motivate the matter content and @xmath0 charges of these models , we do not work within a full grand unified theory .",
    "more precisely , we do not impose the @xmath1 yukawa coupling relations .",

    "first , we consider @xmath193 mixing , which involves two of these parameters , @xmath178 and @xmath173 .",
    "the experimental constraints on these two parameters are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , where the various colors of the points specify the different confidence levels ( c.l . ) that the relevant @xmath174 and @xmath175 values represent .",

    "[ table5 ] ) .",
    "@xmath173 varies within the ranges @xmath194 and @xmath195 in the two regions , respectively .",
    "this is similar to what happens to @xmath196 in the ll limit in  @xcite , since the @xmath197 contributions to @xmath198 in eq .",
    "( [ 403 ] ) are absent in both cases .",
    "in addition , to explain the observed discrepancy in @xmath179 mixing from the sm prediction , @xmath178 is required to be @xmath11 . as discussed in  @xcite",
    ", there are two reasons for this feature .",
    "first , @xmath174 does not deviate significantly from its sm prediction ( the anomaly in @xmath199 mixing is mainly caused by the phase @xmath175 ) .",
    "second , the corrections of a family non - universal @xmath42 arise at tree level , so only a small coupling is needed to explain this small deviation , according to eq .",
    "( [ 403 ] ) .",
    "the smallness of @xmath178 is consistent with our assumption of small fermion mixing angles , since @xmath200 is proportional to them ( see eq .",
    "( [ 457 ] ) ) as well as to @xmath201 .",
    "the constraints from the branching ratio @xmath202 and @xmath203 can be easily satisfied due to the smallness of @xmath178  @xcite .    with the constrained values of @xmath178 and @xmath173 by @xmath179 mixing ,",
    "we illustrate the np contributions to @xmath187 and @xmath177 in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] . in this case , the third parameter ( @xmath185 ) is also involved . for the channel @xmath204 , we take a strategy different from that used in  @xcite , in which it was assumed that the np enters the hadronic decays of neutral @xmath135 meson only through electroweak penguins . in that case , the np effects in the @xmath204 channel can be resolved into a factor @xmath205  @xcite ; the constraints on this factor from a @xmath206 fit of @xmath207 and @xmath208 data have been studied in  @xcite . for our nussm model ,",
    "the np enters generically through qcd as well as electroweak penguins , and hence we treat this channel in the same way as the other @xmath135 decay channels .",
    "we also assume a @xmath209 uncertainty in the sm calculations for each of these modes and a @xmath210 uncertainty for the np contributions . here",
    "@xmath209 is a typical uncertainty level for the hadronic matrix elements of the sm fc operators ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that is needed to explain the experimental results for @xmath211 and @xmath212 in the sm  @xcite .",
    "the difference of the uncertainty levels between the sm and np calculations arises because the hadronic matrix elements of the fc operators in the sm are better understood than those of the np operators . to see whether the anomalies in @xmath179 mixing and the @xmath213 cp asymmetries can be simultaneously accommodated ,",
    "we have carried out a correlated analysis within the @xmath65 model .",

    "are illustrated in fig .",

    "@xmath185 can be positive or negative , since it resolves a minus sign from the degeneracy of two solutions in @xmath200 that is specified by a @xmath218 phase difference  @xcite .",

    "in this paper , we have discussed a class of family non - universal @xmath0 models based on non - standard @xmath1 embeddings of the sm that interchange the standard roles of the two @xmath19 representations present in the fundamental @xmath4 representation of @xmath1 for the third family .",
    "the nussm models in this class are simple and anomaly - free .",
    "they are not full @xmath1 grand unified theories , so the @xmath0 breaking can occur at the tev scale , resulting in a tev - scale @xmath9 gauge boson that can mediate fcnc in the @xmath5 transitions .",
    "we analyzed a representative example of a nussm model ( the @xmath65 model ) , in which we described the low energy spectrum of the theory and determined the constraints on the family non - universal @xmath9 couplings from the @xmath15 sector .",
    "nussm models such as the @xmath65 model are characterized by a rich spectrum of states with masses at the electroweak to tev scale .",
    "the @xmath9-mediated fcnc in the @xmath65 model can easily accommodate the observed discrepancies in the @xmath5 transitions .",
