    "the study of synchronization of coupled oscillators has attracted the attention of widely diverse research disciplines such as neuroscience  @xcite , physics  @xcite , mathematics  @xcite and engineering  @xcite . since the seminal works of winfree  @xcite and kuramoto  @xcite , the kuramoto model has served as a canonical model for synchronization that can capture a quite rich dynamic behavior including multiple equilibria , limit cycles , and even chaos .",
    "there are two main properties that characterize its behavior .",
    "the first one is the coupling function , which is a trigonometric @xmath0 function in the case of the kuramoto model .",
    "however , a broader class of the coupling functions has also been studied  @xcite .",
    "the second property , and perhaps the most important one , is the interconnection topology .",
    "the most popular assumption is that all oscillators are connected to each other , which corresponds to a fully connected graph  @xcite .",
    "although a much more general approach is to study the systems of oscillators with arbitrary underlying topology  @xcite .    due to its complex behavior , several assumptions are usually made to make the study tractable .",
    "for example , one can make the number of oscillators go to infinity , and use statistical mechanics tools to characterize its convergence . or one can assume that all oscillators have equal intrinsic frequencies , and therefore form a ( gradient ) system of homogeneous oscillators  @xcite that has globally convergent properties . alternatively , as we do in this article , one may let the frequencies take distinct values  @xcite and characterize sufficient conditions for synchronization .    in this paper , we consider a system of finite number of heterogeneous kuramoto oscillators with general underlying topology . we show that when certain conditions on the coupling strength and initial phases are satisfied , the trajectories are bounded , which for kuramoto oscillators also implies synchronization .",
    "the most relevant previous work is  @xcite , where the authors studied the same setup . here",
    ", we build upon  @xcite to obtain less restrictive conditions for synchronization .",
    "in particular , by using a novel computational - analytical approach , we are able to further exploit the particular features of each problem instance and outperform existing results .",
    "several examples are used to illustrate our findings and characterize the scaling behavior of our conditions .",
    "we consider a system of oscillators which are described by a kuramoto model , i.e. the behavior of each oscillator is governed by the following equation : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a set of oscillators connected to oscillator @xmath3 , i.e. the set of its neighbors , @xmath4 is the coupling strength , which assumed to be the same for all connections , and @xmath5 is the total number of oscillators in the system .",
    "we also assume that the oscillators are heterogeneous in intrinsic frequencies .",
    "this means that their intrinsic frequencies @xmath6 are not necessary equal . frequencies , however , do not change their values with time , so each @xmath6 is a constant .    in this article",
    "we study frequency synchronization of the system .",
    "the oscillators achieve synchronization if @xmath7 as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a constant common phase velocity .",
    "it is easy to show that this common phase velocity @xmath9 is an average sum of intrinsic frequencies of the oscillators .",
    "that is ,   @xmath10    indeed , when @xmath11 , adding up all the equations of gives : @xmath12 , because each @xmath13 is added to @xmath14 and gives zero .",
    "we denote the average natural frequency by @xmath15 , and define the deviations of the natural frequencies by + @xmath16 , where @xmath17 . from now on we will study the following system instead of system :    @xmath18    each limit cycle of system is an equilibrium of .",
    "therefore , we will focus on finding conditions when system converges to an equilibrium , i.e. when @xmath19 . due to the rotational invariance of ,",
    "we can shift without loss of generality , all the initial phases @xmath20 by the same value @xmath21 so that their sum becomes equal to zero : @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , since the phase average remains the same ( for system : @xmath23 ) , condition @xmath24 will be satisfied @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are the trajectories of system . in the rest of this article",
    "we will assume that the phase values sum up to zero at each time @xmath27 .    in this article",
    "we show synchronization of oscillators by providing a lyapunov function and using lasalle s invariance theorem @xcite .",
    "when all the intrinsic frequencies are equal , i.e. deviations @xmath28 , the oscillators are called homogeneous , and the following lyapunov function can be employed : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the edge set of a given graph .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath32 thus , since the function @xmath33 is @xmath34-periodic on each element @xmath35 in @xmath36 , it is also well - defined on a n - dimensional torus ( @xmath37 ) , which is compact .",
    "thus , applying the lasalle s invariance theorem ( on @xmath37 ) guarantees synchronization of the oscillators .",
    "when the intrinsic frequencies are not equal , we have a system of heterogeneous oscillators , and we still can provide a potential function for this case : @xmath38 we can check again that the time derivative of this function is also non - positive and equal to zero only at an equilibrium , i.e. when the frequencies are synchronized .",
    "the problem here is that function @xmath39 is not bounded from below and can not be defined on the @xmath5-dimensional torus @xmath40 , and therefore , we are not able to apply directly the lasalle s invariance theorem . however ,",
    "if we show that the trajectories @xmath41 of are bounded , then the function @xmath39 is bounded as well , and hence synchronization follows .    therefore , the main goal of this study is to find the conditions that guarantee that trajectories are bounded .",
    "we will achieve this by finding a compact positively invariant set ( pis ) for the oscillators phases .",
    "that is , a compact ( closed and bounded ) set such that if the system s initial conditions are within this set , the trajectories will remain in the set .",
    "the next section shows that when some conditions are met , such pis exists , and therefore system will converge to the set of equilibria .",
    "this section is organized as follows .",
    "we first formulate in proposition 1 a general sufficient condition for boundedness of the trajectories that leads to synchronization of system .",
    "we then provide two solutions that guarantee fulfillment of proposition 1 .",
    "our first solution , described in subsection @xmath42 , contains explicit requirements on the coupling strength and initial oscillators phases .",
    "this solution is further refined using computational tools in subsection @xmath43 .",
    "we will denote maximum and minimum phase values at time @xmath44 by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a phase of oscillator @xmath3 at time @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath48 be defined as a maximum phase difference between two oscillators at time @xmath44 @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath50 then @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "in other words , each phase lies between the minimum and maximum phases @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the maximum initial ( at time @xmath55 ) pairwise phase difference is denoted by @xmath56 : @xmath57 if we can show that the maximum phase difference is always bounded , i.e. if @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a constant satisfying @xmath60 , then the trajectories will be also bounded since the phase average remains the same .",
    "the pis therefore is defined through the maximum phase difference that is bounded by the value of @xmath59 , i.e. @xmath61 which is obviously a compact .",
    "we can now formulate a general condition that is sufficient to guarantee that the maximum phase difference is always bounded by a constant @xmath59 and thus the trajectories are also bounded .",
    "* proposition 1 * _ if @xmath59 is a constant satisfying @xmath60 , and for all times @xmath62 such that @xmath63 , the following condition is satisfied : @xmath64 for every two oscillators @xmath65 and @xmath66 such that @xmath67 and @xmath68 , then the maximum phase difference is bounded by @xmath59 , i.e. @xmath69 for all @xmath62 , trajectories of system are bounded , and system achieves frequency synchronization . _    condition says that when the maximum phase difference achieves value @xmath59 , it can not grow anymore and thus does not exceed @xmath59 .",
    "that s why the maximum phase difference will be always bounded by @xmath59 if is satisfied , and because the phase average remains the same , it also ensures that the trajectories of system are bounded in @xmath70 .",
    "since function @xmath71 is well - defined in @xmath70 , we can now apply lasalle s invariance theorem to guarantee that each solution of approaches the nonempty set @xmath72 , and system achieves frequency synchronization .",
    "it is possible that when @xmath73 , several oscillators have phase values equal to @xmath54 or @xmath53 . in this case condition",
    "should be satisfied for each pair of oscillators with a phase difference equal to @xmath59 .",
    "condition is very general by itself and difficult to check . in the rest of this section",
    "we derive two conditions  analytic and optimization - based  that guarantee condition .",
    "these conditions contain requirements on the coupling strength and initial phases of oscillators that can be verified for each given system .",
    "we now introduce some additional notation .",
    "let @xmath74 i.e. @xmath75 is the squared euclidean norm of a vector of phases at time @xmath44 . for simplicity we will use symbol @xmath76 instead of @xmath75 . at initial time",

    "the only two bounds that guarantee the existence of a positively invariant set for arbitrary topologies are theorem 4.6 from @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "<S> examples are provided to illustrate our results as well as the improvement over previous existing bounds . </S>"
