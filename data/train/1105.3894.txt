    ", the application of this special configuration in modern biotechnology has experienced an enormous growth over the last years @xcite . since the i - motif becomes unstable at ph values larger than 7 , a systematic decrease and increase of protons in the solution by changing the ph value results in a reversible folding and unfolding mechanism .",

    "a stable partly planar configuration appears on a timescale of 7 ns .",
    "+ the calculation of the essential dynamics in combination with the corresponding free energy landscape allows to determine the unfolding pathways .",
    "two main unfolding mechanisms can be identified where the preferential one is entropically more favourable leading to lower free energies .",
    "we have shown that large contributions to the entropy values arise from local water entropy deficits which are caused by hydrogen bonds .",
    "the nature of these bonds and their importance for a temperature - dependent entropy has been investigated in detail .",
    "hence we have shown that the prior unfolding process is mainly determined by entropic contributions dominated by lower dna - solvent ordering interactions .",
    "+ the numerical results are in good agreement to experimental cd spectra .",
    "it can be shown that the temperature dependence of the experimentally observed results can be explained by a vanishing of hairpin structures at higher temperatures due to a variation of the free energy landscape . by analyzing the spectral data",
    ", it becomes obvious that base stacking energies largely dominate intramolecular interactions at lower temperatures which also validates the presence of hairpin structures @xcite . +",
    "thus our results allow to improve the usage of i - motifs in nanomachines due to the estimation of the unfolding pathway and its stable configurations .",
    "as it has been discussed above , we have validated that a full unfolding into a stretched structure is not energetically favourable and can be only realized by thermal or energetic activation .",
    "this sheds a new light on the importance of the unfolding pathway and its stable configurations .",
    "it was assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the unfolding process of an i - motif leads to a fully extended conformation which is in contrast to our results .",
    "although it can be concluded that the presence of a large number of grafted i - motifs may lead to different unfolding pathways due to interchain interactions , our results allow to optimize the improvement for low grafting densities which are needed for the fabrication of nanocontainers @xcite .",
    "we currently have undertaken attempts to investigate these properties in more detail .",
    "+ however , even in a biological context our results can be adopted for a further study of possible i - motif configurations in the human cell . as it has been discussed in the introduction , this may be important for a pharmaceutical point of view due to the fact that the upstream of the i - motif along the insuline gene is related to its conformation and therefore facilitates transcription @xcite .",
    "hence we hope that our results allow to achieve a deeper insight into the mechanisms of i - motif formation in vivo and vitro .",
