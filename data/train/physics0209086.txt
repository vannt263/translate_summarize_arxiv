    "two - photon e1m1 rates are also expected to be significant for heavy two - electron ions other than u@xmath11 and calculations are needed . to date , the only ion with @xmath12 for which a measurement of hyperfine quenching has been made is heliumlike gadolinium @xcite ; for the isotope @xmath13gd , the e1m1 correction to the lifetime is only 0.08% .",

    "additionally , we give @xmath16 rates for ions with @xmath17 having @xmath9 .",
    "although e1m1 transitions are very interesting for relativistic theories , because of the very large negative - energy contributions to the transition amplitudes , direct measurements of e1m1 transitions have not yet been made .",

    "one problem of two - photon expressions is distinguishing between `` pure '' and cascade two - photon processes .",
    "the separation is needed for calculations of a total rate since the cascade process is already included in a single - photon decay rate but the pure two - photon process is not .",
    "( actually , this provides a good definition for a cascade process . )",
    "although for the off - resonance contribution the cascade process is negligible , near the resonance it dominates . in @xcite ,",
    "the subtraction of quadratic resonant terms was used to calculate the pure two - photon contribution .",
    "since some details are not clear , we describe in the appendix a subtraction procedure in more detail .",
    "we define a cascade process as the quadratic resonant term with a fixed frequency in the numerator ( this was not stated in @xcite and is important ) .",
    "this definition is reasonable because it gives a lorentzian profile and after integration over frequencies of the resonant photon the expected single - photon rate , provided one resonant channel dominates as is the case .",
    "subtracting this cascade process from the total two - photon contribution , we can define the pure two - photon spectrum . near resonance portion of the spectrum",
    "becomes closely antisymmetric and upon symmetric integration will contribute insignificantly .",
    "resonant contributions can then be discarded placing grid points far away from resonant regions and the pure two - photon contribution can be trivially evaluated . in the appendix",
    ", we analyze the line shape of the pure two - photon spectrum near the strong resonance ( there is also a second , weaker resonance but its contribution is less important ) .",
    "since we wish to consider highly - charged ions , we base our calculations on the dirac equation . to treat small correlation effects , of order @xmath49 , we use three starting potentials : coulomb potential with @xmath50 , coulomb potential with @xmath51 , and the model potential @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the electrostatic potential of a single @xmath54 electron . among the three ,",
    "the model potential takes into account correlations most completely , in that experimental energy levels are closely reproduced .",
    "therefore , in our final compilation of two - photon rates , the model potential results are used .    to carry out the sum over intermediate states , for each of the three potentials we use a b - spline basis set consisting of 40 positive - energy and 40 negative - energy basis orbitals for each angular momentum state constrained to a cavity of radius @xmath55 .",
    "the completeness of this basis is reflected by precise gauge invariance : for example , in the coulomb potential @xmath56 for heliumlike uranium , the reduced two - photon matrix elements in the length and the velocity forms are @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "negative energy contributions , which almost for 2e1 transitions are small , are important in the case of e1m1 transitions .    since four of the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eqq ] ) have resonant energy denominators and the two - photon transition rate is extremely sensitive to photon frequencies ( @xmath59 ) , we replace the approximate lowest - order energies by accurate two - electron energies in these four terms : @xmath60 , @xmath61 } \\rightarrow e(1s2s^{\\;3}s_{1})$ ] , @xmath62 } \\rightarrow e(1s2p^{\\;3}p_{0})$ ] , and @xmath63 } \\rightarrow e(1s2p^{\\;1}p_{1})$ ] , where the accurate energies @xmath64 are taken from @xcite .",
    "similar replacements were used by  @xcite in his calculations of the two - photon rate for u@xmath65 .",
    "using the procedure described in previous section , we compute the two - photon transition rates according to the eq([eq1 ] ) and after subtraction resonances integrate the differential rate to obtain the total two - photon rate . since the behavior of the rates with @xmath0 is very smooth , we performed calculations only for eleven different ions .",
    "table  [ table1 ] summarizes our results for total transition rates .",
    "the three potentials , discussed above , give results in close agreement , but the model potential for which length - velocity agreement ranges 0.4 - 1.5% and so does approximately accuracy should be considered the most accurate .",
