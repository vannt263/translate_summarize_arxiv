    "one of the major achievements of hera was the experimental evidence @xcite shown in fig .",
    "[ zeus - h1 ] that among the whole set of @xmath0 deep inelastic scattering events , almost 10% are diffractive ( ddis ) , of the form @xmath1 with a rapidity gap between the proton remnants @xmath2 and the hadrons @xmath3 coming from the fragmentation region of the initial virtual photon .",
    "diffraction can be theoretically described according to several approaches .",
    "the first one involves a _ resolved _ pomeron contribution ( with a parton distribution function inside the pomeron ) , see fig .",
    "[ resdirect ] ( left ) , while the second one relies on a _ direct _ pomeron contribution involving the coupling of a pomeron with the diffractive state , see fig .",
    "[ resdirect ] ( right ) .",
    "the diffractive states can be modelled in perturbation theory by a @xmath4 pair ( for moderate @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the invariant mass of the diffractively produced state @xmath3 ) or by higher fock states as a @xmath7 state for larger values of @xmath5 .",
    "based on such a model , with a two - gluon exchange picture for the pomeron , a good description of hera data for diffraction  @xcite could be achieved  @xcite .",
    "one of the important features of this approach is that the @xmath4 component with a longitudinally polarized photon plays a crucial role in the region of small diffractive mass @xmath6 , although it is a twist-4 contribution . in the direct components considered there , the @xmath7",
    "diffractive state has been studied in two particular limits .",
    "the first one , valid for very large @xmath8 , corresponds to a collinear approximation in which the transverse momentum of the gluon is assumed to be much smaller than the transverse momentum of the emitter  @xcite .",
    "the second one  @xcite , valid for very large @xmath5 , is based on the assumption of a strong ordering of longitudinal momenta , encountered in bfkl equation  @xcite . both these approaches were combined in order to describe hera data for ddis  @xcite .    based on these very successful developments led at hera in order to understand the qcd dynamics with diffractive events , it would be appropriate to look for similar hard diffractive events at lhc . the idea there is to adapt the concept of photoproduction of diffractive jets , which was performed at hera  @xcite , now with a flux of quasi - real photons in ultraperipheral collisions ( upc )  @xcite , relying on the notion of equivalent photon approximation . in both cases ,",
    "the hard scale is provided by the invariant mass of the tagged jets .",
    "we here report on our computation  @xcite of the @xmath9 impact factor at tree level with an arbitrary number of @xmath10-channel gluons described within the wilson line formalism , also called qcd shockwave approach  @xcite . as an aside",
    ", we rederive the @xmath11 impact factor .",
    "in particular , the @xmath9 transition is computed without any soft or collinear approximation for the emitted gluon , in contrast with the above mentioned calculations .",
    "these results provide necessary generalization of building blocks for inclusive ddis as well as for two- and three - jet diffractive production . since the results we derived can account for an arbitrary number of @xmath10-channel gluons",
    ", this could allow to include higher twist effects which are suspected to be rather important in ddis for @xmath12 gev@xmath13  @xcite .",
    "as stated before , we use balitsky s shockwave formalism .",
    "its application shows that this method is very powerful in determining evolution equations and impact factors at next - to - leading order for inclusive processes  @xcite , at semi - inclusive level for @xmath14-broadening in @xmath15 collisions  @xcite or in the evaluation of the triple pomeron vertex beyond the planar limit  @xcite , when compared with usual methods based on summation of contributions of individual feynman diagrams computed in momentum space .",
    "it is an effective way of estimating the effect of multigluon exchange .",
    "its formulation in coordinate space makes it natural in view of describing saturation  @xcite .",
    "+ we use the following notation .",
    "we introduce the light cone vectors @xmath16 and @xmath17@xmath18 then , one introduces wilson lines as @xmath19\\ , .",

    "we will denote the longitudinal cut - off @xmath26    we use the light cone gauge @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the sum of the external field @xmath29 and the quantum field @xmath30@xmath31 where @xmath32 is a profile function .",
    "+ indeed , let us consider an external gluon field @xmath33 in its rest frame and boost it along the @xmath24 direction .",
    "one obtains : @xmath34 assuming that the field vanishes at infinity , one immediately gets that only its minus component survives the boost in the limit @xmath35 and that it does not depend on @xmath36 and contains @xmath37 thus justifying the form of @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) .",
    "the natural and extensively used operator appearing in studies of diffractive processes within the shock wave approach is the dipole operator @xmath39 constructed from the wilson line ( [ wl ] ) .",
    "in the leading order the diagram contributing to the impact factor for @xmath40 transition is shown in fig . [ leading ] ,",
    "in which @xmath41 denote the coordinates of interaction points with the photon and the shock wave .",
    "after projection on the color singlet state and subtraction of the contribution without interaction with the shock wave , the contribution of this diagram can be written in the momentum space as ( factorizing out a global qed factor @xmath42 ) @xmath43 denoting @xmath44 , we get for a longitudinally polarized photon @xmath45 whereas for a transversally polarized photon @xmath46",

    "let us notice that the dipole operator @xmath54 involves terms at least of order @xmath55 .",

    "otherwise they can be expressed as a simple convergent integral over @xmath59 $ ] that can be performed numerically for any future phenomenological study .",
    "the calculation of virtual corrections to the @xmath11 involves two kinds of contributions .",
    "the diagrams contributing to virtual corrections in which the radiated gluon does not cross the shock wave are shown in fig .",
    "[ nlo ] , whereas the diagrams in which the radiated gluon interacts with the shock wave are illustrated in the fig .",
    "[ nlosw ] .",
    "this calculation is much more complicated than the computation of the real contribution to the @xmath9 impact factor discussed above .",
    "although it only involves one - loop diagrams , the complications arise due to the presence of many different scales .",
    "indeed , our aim is to obtain results in the general kinematics where the virtuality of incoming photon , the @xmath60channel momentum transfer and the invariant mass @xmath5 of the diffractive two - jet state are arbitrary .",
