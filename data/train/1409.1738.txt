    "doping liquid crystals ( lcs ) with nanoparticles ( nps ) in low volume concentrations has been shown as a promising method to modify the properties of liquid crystals .",
    "the presence of nanoparticles in liquid crystal changes the properties of the mesophase and/or introduces some new features of the composite mixtures . after introducing the idea theoretically by brochard and de gennes @xcite several reports have shown that the doping of liquid crystals with magnetic nanoparticles can either increase or decrease the critical field of the magnetic fredericksz transition @xcite , depending on the host - guest combination",
    "it has also been proven @xcite that ferronematics respond to low magnetic fields ( below 0.1  t ) due to doping with magnetic particles .",
    "furthermore , the theoretically predicted magnetic field - induced isotropic - nematic phase transition @xcite was observed in calamitic liquid crystals at relatively low magnetic fields ( below 12  t ) when they are doped with magnetic nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "properties of magnetic nanoparticles significantly depend on their size , shape and structure .",
    "therefore , the properties of ferronematics composed of them are also expected to be sensitive to the same factors . as an example , in our previous work @xcite it was shown that doping the liquid crystal 4-(trans-4-n - hexylcyclohexyl)-isothiocyanato - benzene ( 6chbt ) with spherical magnetic particles results in soft anchoring ( @xmath0  @xmath1  1 ) , while in the case of doping with rod - like magnetic particles rigid anchoring ( @xmath0  @xmath1  10@xmath2 ) was obtained at the lc - np interface , even though both kinds of magnetic particles were coated with the same surfactant ( oleic acid ) . here , the parameter @xmath0  =  @xmath3 is the ratio of the interfacial ( anchoring ) to the bulk ( elastic ) energies ; @xmath4 is the anchoring energy density , @xmath5 is the reference size of the nps @xcite which in case of cylindrical particles coincides with their mean radius @xmath6 @xcite , and @xmath7 is the corresponding elastic modulus of the host lc .",
    "recently , a mean - field theory has been developed by gorkunov and osipov @xcite to describe the influence of embedded nanoparticles on the orientational order and on the isotropic - nematic phase transition of the host liquid crystal .",
    "they considered relatively large , uniaxial nps of oblate or prolate shape , where the interaction between the lc molecules and the nps may be described by an anisotropic surface potential depending on the coupling between the surface normal of the particle and the long molecular axis of the host .",
    "it has been shown that spherically isotropic nanoparticles effectively dilute the liquid crystal medium and decrease the isotropic - nematic transition temperature .",
    "on the contrary , anisotropic nanoparticles become aligned by the nematic host and , reciprocally , improve the liquid crystal alignment , thus extending the nematic order to higher temperatures .",
    "this theory has inspired us to perform measurements with the nematic liquid crystal 6chbt doped with spherical or rod - shaped magnetic nanoparticles .",
    "the present work is devoted to an experimental study of how the shape , as well as the volume concentration of magnetic nanoparticles affect the temperature of the isotropic - nematic phase transition .",
    "the obtained results indicate a significant effect in accordance with the theoretical expectations described in @xcite .",
    "the spherical magnetic nps were prepared by the co - precipitation method described in @xcite .",
    "the rod - like iron oxide nps were synthesized through smooth decomposition of urea @xcite .",
    "the smaller particles were synthesized by co - precipitation of fe@xmath8 and fe@xmath9 in oleic acid micelles .",
    "the synthesis of the longer iron oxide particles utilized precipitation of fe@xmath9 in the presence of oleic acid as stabilizer .",
    "the morphology and size distribution of the prepared nps were determined by transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) .",
    "[ tem ] shows the tem images of the prepared spherical and rod - like nanoparticles .",
    "the mean diameter of the spherical magnetic nps was @xmath10  nm . the average diameter of the shorter rod - like nanoparticles was @xmath11  nm and the mean length was @xmath12  nm .",
    "the longer rod - like nps had the average diameter of @xmath13  nm and their mean length was @xmath14  nm .",
    "the ferronematic samples were based on the thermotropic nematic 6chbt which is a low - temperature - melting enantiotropic liquid crystal with high chemical stability @xcite . the phase transition temperature from the isotropic liquid to the nematic phase ( the clearing point ) of the studied nematic was found by polarizing optical microscopy at t@xmath15 = 43.3@xmath16c .",
    "the doping was done by adding nanoparticles ( spherical or rod - like ) to the liquid crystal in the isotropic phase under continuous stirring .",
    "the nanoparticles were coated with oleic acid as a surfactant to suppress their aggregation .",
    "the ferronematic samples were prepared with three different volume concentrations of the spherical as well as of the rod - like magnetic particles : @xmath17 = 1 @xmath18 10@xmath19 , @xmath20 = 5 @xmath18 10@xmath19 and @xmath21 = 1 @xmath18 10@xmath22 .    the structural transition from the isotropic to the nematic phase",
    "was monitored by polarizing microscope as well as by capacitance measurements .",
    "the prepared samples were filled into a capacitor made of ito - coated glass electrodes with the electrode area approximately 1  cm  @xmath18  1  cm .",
    "the distance between the electrodes ( the sample thickness ) was @xmath23  =  5  @xmath24 m .",
    "the samples ( the undoped 6chbt , or 6chbt doped by various nps ) were filled into the cells in the isotropic phase due to capillary forces . a rubbed polyimide coating on the electrodes ensured planar orientation .    for all samples the measurements started with polarizing microscopic observations .",
    "the samples were put into a linkam hot stage , heated to the isotropic state , then the samples were slowly cooled ( at the rate of 1@xmath25c / min ) to the nematic state while monitoring their textures between crossed polarizers .",
    "the transition temperature t@xmath15 was taken as the temperature , where nematic droplets appeared in the isotropic melt in the cooling process .",
    "next , the temperature dependence of the capacitance of the same samples was measured in the same cells at the frequency of 1  khz by a high precision capacitance bridge andeen hagerling ( the accuracy at 1  khz is 0.8  af ) . the samples were first heated to the isotropic phase and then they were again slowly cooled to the nematic phase ( at the rate of 1@xmath25c / min )",
    "fig .  [ spher ] shows the temperature dependence of the reduced capacitance ( @xmath26 for the undoped 6chbt and for the ferronematics containing spherical magnetic nps in different volume concentrations .",
    "here @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 correspond to the capacitances at the actual , at the highest and at the lowest temperatures , respectively .",
    "each curve exhibits a monotonic decrease of the capacitance with diminishing temperature . in the isotropic phase the capacitance is nearly constant .",
    "the sudden drop of the capacitance indicates the appearance of the orientational order ( and hence the increase of the anisotropy ) , i.e. the phase transition to the nematic phase .",
    "the decrease of @xmath27 occurs due to the planar alignment and the positive dielectric anisotropy of 6chbt and the 6chbt - based ferronematics .",
    "[ spher ] clearly shows that doping with spherical nps results in a shift of @xmath30 towards lower temperatures ; the shift becomes larger with increasing the volume concentration of magnetic nps .",
    "this is in accordance with the expectations , as nps behave as impurities introducing disorder and thus reducing @xmath30 .",
    "[ short ] and  [ long ] also show the temperature dependence of the reduced capacitance , however , for ferronematics doped by short and long rod - like magnetic nanoparticles , respectively .",
    "the monotonicity of the temperature dependence and the easy detectability of the isotropic - nematic phase transition temperature hold here too .",
    "however , in the case of doping 6chbt with rod - like magnetic nps , @xmath30 shifts towards higher temperatures . moreover ,",
    "though the increasing volume concentration of nps initially enhances the shift , this tendency turns over for higher concentration .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath30 still remains higher for the samples doped with rod - like nps than that in the undoped lc .",
    "the differences between the behaviour of ferronematics containing nps of different shape is even more perceptible in fig .",
    "[ spolu ] which shows the dependence of the @xmath30 on the volume concentration of nps , obtained by capacitance measurements and by polarizing microscopy .",
    "as one can see , the results provided by the two independent techniques are in good agreement . fig .",
    "[ spolu ] clearly shows , that the increase of the phase transition temperature is more pronounced when long rod - like nps are used for the doping instead of the short ones . in order to understand these features",
    "one has to recall the recent theory of gorkunov and osipov @xcite .",
    "they have developed a mean - field molecular description of the thermodynamics of nematic liquid crystals mixed with nps , which may be anisotropic due to their shape , their surface treatment , and/or their spontaneous polarization .",
    "as it has been shown , the large shape anisotropy of nps ( namely the rod - likeness ) enhances the nematic order and , as a consequence , increases the phase transition temperature .",
    "in contrast to that , spherical nps reduce the orientational order and thus lower @xmath30 .",
    "these conclusions are in agreement with our experimental findings presented in figs .",
    "[ spher ]  -  [ spolu ] and explain the different signs of the shift of @xmath30 for spherical and rod - like nps .",
    "moreover , it is evident from our tem measurements that longer rod - like nanoparticles have a larger length / diameter ratio ( @xmath31  22 ) than the shorter nps ( @xmath31  5 ) ; i.e. longer nps have higher anisotropy and thus larger shift in @xmath30 .",
    "in order to prevent aggregation of nps , they are usually coated with surfactants during the preparation . in a recent work various ligands",
    "were used for this purpose for two different nps of spherical shape dispersed in a polymorphic lc @xcite . a slight , though measurable change in the phase transition temperatures has been reported in these dispersions",
    ". however , the influence of the type and concentration of the nps , as well as the type of the surfactant on the phase transition temperature shift could not be distinguished clearly from these measurements .",
    "therefore , we have coated all magnetic nps ( spherical and rod - like ) with the same surfactant ( oleic acid ) .",
    "the theoretical description in @xcite remains valid if the surface of the nanoparticles is coated by organic molecules .",
    "however , one has to take into account that in general , the surfactant dilutes the liquid crystal , reduces its order and thus lowers the isotropic - nematic phase transition temperature in itself . in the case of doping with coated magnetic nanoparticles ,",
    "the increasing volume concentration of nps increases the concentration of the surfactant as well .",
    "when spherical nps are used as dopants , the surfactant and the nps have a similar effect on @xmath30 resulting in its decrease , as shown in fig .",
    "[ spher ] .",
    "in contrast to that , using rod - like dopants the nps and the surfactant counteract ; the effect of the surfactant ( which decreases @xmath30 ) seems to prevail at higher concentrations .",
    "this may explain the nonmonotonic concentration dependence of @xmath30 seen in fig .",
    "[ spolu ] , and is also in good qualitative agreement with the gorkunov - osipov theory .",
    "finally , we note that in ferronematics based on 6chbt , the magnetic moment ( which is in case of rod - like nps parallel with their long axis ) coincides with the nematic director as it has been shown in our previous work @xcite . however ,",
    "because of the low volume concentration ( order of 10@xmath19 - 10@xmath22 ) and small value of the magnetic moment ( order of 10@xmath32  tm@xmath33 ) of nps their magnetic interaction can be considered negligible , and therefore , does not influence the lc order significantly .",
    "we have found that the shape as well as the volume concentration of magnetic nanoparticles have a significant influence on the temperature of the isotropic to nematic phase transition of ferronematics .",
    "we have justified that ferronematics doped with rod - like magnetic nanoparticles have higher @xmath30 than the host nematic or ferronematics containing spherical nanoparticles .",
    "we have found that doping with rod - like nps yields a nonmonotonic concentration dependence of @xmath30 , which could be attributed to the competing influence of the nanoparticles and of the organic surfactants they are coated with .",
    "our results provide a firm experimental proof for the main conclusion of the recent mean - field theory of gorkunov and osipov @xcite .",
