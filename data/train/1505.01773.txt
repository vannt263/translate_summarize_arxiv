    "in this paper we apply a mixture of analytical and topological methods to establish that a recently derived solution defining equatorially trapped waves is dynamically possible .",
    "this remarkable solution , derived by constantin in @xcite and given below by equation , is an exact solution of the nonlinear @xmath0plane governing equations for equatorial water waves , and it is explicit in the lagrangian framework .",
    "the main result of this paper establishes that the three - dimensional mapping from the lagrangian labelling domain to the fluid domain defines a global diffeomorphism a consequence of which is that the solution defines a fluid motion which is dynamically possible .",
    "we achieve this result by first establishing that is locally diffeomorphic and injective , and then we render our results global by applying a suitable version of the classical degree - theoretic _ invariance of domain _ theorem , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the solution presented by constantin in @xcite represents a geophysical generalization of the celebrated gerstner s wave , in the sense that ignoring coriolis terms in recovers gerstner s wave solution .",
    "the primary importance of gerstner s wave is probably the fact that it represents the only known explicit and exact solution of the nonlinear periodic gravity wave problem with a non - flat free - surface .",
    "gerstner s wave is a two - dimensional wave propagating over a fluid domain of infinite depth ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and interestingly it may be modified to describe edge - waves propagating over a sloping bed @xcite .",
    "the geophysical solution presented in @xcite encompasses gerstner s solution , yet it also possesses a number of inherent characteristics which transcends gerstner s wave .",
    "the solution is a truly three - dimensional eastward - propagating geophysical wave , and furthermore it is equatorially - trapped achieving its greatest amplitude at the equator and exhibiting a strong exponential decay in meridional directions away from the equator .",
    "the solution is furthermore nonlinear , as is seen from the wave - surface profile , and has a dispersion relation that is dependant on the coriolis parameter .",
    "since the solution is explicit in the lagrangian formulation , we may immediately discern some qualitative properties of the physical fluid motion .",
    "indeed , an advantage of solutions in the lagrangian framework is that the fluid kinematics may be explicitly described @xcite . from",
    "we see that at each fixed latitude the solution prescribes individual fluid particles to move clockwise in a vertical plane .",
    "each particle moves in a circle , with the diameter of the circles decreasing exponentially with depth .",
    "in @xcite it was simply shown that the solution is compatible with the governing equations of the @xmath0plane approximation for equatorial water waves - .",
    "the aim of this paper is to rigorously justify that the fluid motion defined by is dynamically possible .",
    "this is achieved by establishing that the solution defines a global diffeomorphism , thereby ensuring that it is indeed possible to have a three - dimensional motion of the whole fluid body where all the particles describe circles with a depth- dependant radius at fixed latitudes , and furthermore the particles never collide but instead they fill out the entire infinite region below the surface wave . in so",
    "doing we show that the fluid domain as a whole evolves in a manner which is consistent with the full governing equations .",
    "we note that subsequent to the derivation of constantin s solution , a wide range of geophysical generalizations and variations to @xcite have been produced and analysed , for example @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the rigorous considerations of this paper are also applicable to these variants .",
    "we consider geophysical waves in the equatorial region , where we assume that the earth is a perfect sphere of radius @xmath1 km .",
    "we are in a rotating framework , where the @xmath2-axis is facing horizontal due east ( zonal direction ) , the @xmath3-axis is due north ( meridional direction ) , and the @xmath4-axis is pointing vertically upwards .",
    "the governing equations for geophysical ocean waves are given by euler s equation with additional terms involving the coriolis parameter which is proportional to the rotation speed of the earth , see @xcite @xmath5 the mass conservation equation @xmath6 and the equation of incompressibility @xmath7 here @xmath8 represents the latitude , @xmath9 is the fluid velocity , @xmath10  rad@xmath11s is the ( constant ) rotational speed of earth ( which is the sum of the rotation of the earth about its axis and the rotation around the sun , see @xcite ) , @xmath12  m / s@xmath13 is the gravitational constant , @xmath14 is the water density , and @xmath15 is the pressure .",
    "we are interested in equatorial waves , that is , geophysical ocean waves in a region which is within @xmath16 latitude of the equator .",
    "since the latitude is small , we may use the approximations @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , and thus linearising the coriolis force leads to the @xmath19-plane approximation to equations given by @xmath20 where @xmath21  m@xmath22s@xmath22 .",
    "the relevant boundary conditions are the kinematic boundary conditions @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the ( constant ) atmospheric pressure , and @xmath26 is the free surface .",
    "the boundary condition states that all the particles in the surface will stay in the surface for all time @xmath27 , and the boundary condition decouples the water flow from the motion of the air above .",
    "we work with an infinitely - deep fluid domain and so we require the velocity field to converge rapidly to zero with depth , that is @xmath28 the governing equations for the @xmath0plane approximation of geophysical ocean waves are given by - .      in this section",
    "we present and describe briefly the exact solution of the @xmath19-plane governing equations - which was recently derived by constantin @xcite .",
    "this solution describes a three- dimensional eastward - propagating geophysical wave which is equatorially trapped , exhibiting a strong exponential decay in meridional directions away from the equator , and which is periodic in the zonal direction .",
    "equatorially trapped waves propagating eastward and symmetric about the equator are known to exist , and they are regarded as one of the key factors in a possible explanation of the el nio phenomenon ( cf .",
    "the formulation of the solution employs a lagrangian viewpoint , describing the evolution in time of an individual fluid particle @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian positions of the fluid @xmath29 are given in terms of the labelling variables @xmath30 , and time @xmath27 by @xmath31}\\sin \\left[k(q - ct )          \\right],\\\\          y&\\displaystyle = s,\\\\          z&\\displaystyle = r+{1\\over k}e^{k\\left[r - f(s)\\right]}\\cos \\left[k(q - ct )          \\right ] ,      \\end{array }      \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the wave number , defined by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the wavelength , and the wave phase speed is determined by the dispersion relation @xmath35 and also @xmath36 determines the decay of fluid particle oscillations in the meridional direction .",
    "the labelling variables take the values @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is fixed . for every fixed @xmath39 ,",
