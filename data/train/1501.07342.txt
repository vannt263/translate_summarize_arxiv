    "[ fig : argument]a ) .",
    "cells respond to morphogen @xmath1 by modulating gene expression through intrinsically noise - prone signal transduction and transcription / translation processes .",
    "we will model this response as a composition of three steps , three elementary operations that constitute the `` toolkit '' with which cells can access and process information contained in patterning cues : _ access _ , _ amplify _ , and _",
    "let @xmath11 be a gene product whose expression is controlled by @xmath1 .",
    "the simplest readout is achieved by placing gene @xmath11 under the control of a promoter that is responsive to @xmath2 and by accumulating the output protein for some time @xmath12 . in our model",
    ", we express the amount of @xmath11 produced during this time by a cell @xmath5 as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a noisy estimate of the true concentration @xmath15 that the system could obtain in time @xmath12 ( `` access '' ) , and @xmath16 is some deterministic input - output function ( `` amplify '' ) ; for simplicity , we first consider @xmath16 to be pure linear amplification with coefficient @xmath17 , denoted @xmath18 .",
    "the `` access '' operation is the key element of our framework . specifically , we write @xmath19 where @xmath20 reflects the intrinsic stochasticity of transcription and , in principle , many other noise sources .",
    "here we will model @xmath20 simply as being drawn from a gaussian distribution of width @xmath21 .",
    "in other words , we postulate that each `` access '' operation takes time @xmath12 and comes at the price of corrupting the signal with extra noise of magnitude @xmath21 .",
    "the final toolkit operation is averaging .",
    "because patterning systems typically act over durations that are long ( hours ) compared to the time required to synthesize mrna and protein ( minutes ) , cells can perform temporal averaging by allowing stable gene products to accumulate  @xcite : if @xmath22 is the time available for patterning , the system can effectively perform @xmath23 access operations .",
    "in addition , the production of soluble factors that can be shared between cells gives rise to spatial averaging  @xcite .",
    "both types of averaging offer the system some capacity to perform multiple measurements of the input , which we capture formally by an averaging operator @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 indicates the effective number of independent measurements , so that application of @xmath24 to a morphogen , by definition , reduces expression fluctuations by a factor @xmath26 .",
    "we distinguish between two patterning strategies . in the first ( `` direct strategy '' ; fig .",
    "[ fig : argument]a ) , cell - fate - specific target genes are controlled directly by @xmath2 and no other patterning factors are involved .",
    "any available averaging mechanisms are applied to @xmath2 itself . in the second ( `` two - tier '' ) strategy , cells perform an amplifying readout of @xmath2 with input - output function @xmath18 to establish a spatial profile of a second factor @xmath27 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : argument]b ) .",
    "the pattering time @xmath22 is spent on accumulating and averaging @xmath27 .",
    "mathematically , in the two scenarios , the cell - fate - specific target genes are controlled by : @xmath28 & & \\text{(direct strategy)}\\label{eq : directstrategy}\\\\    c^{(\\lambda)}&= g_{n_{\\mathrm{eff}}}[f_\\lambda(c+\\eta)]&&\\text{(two - tier strategy)}\\label{eq : twotierstrategy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now ask : when , if ever , does the noisy amplification step of the two - tier strategy provide a benefit to the system ?    .",
    "* b : * the two - tier strategy involves a second patterning factor @xmath27 ; target genes are separated from the input by two tiers of `` access '' operations .",
    "left , raw information content .",
    "right , accessible information content.[fig : argument ] ]    * standard information - theoretic considerations do not explain the benefits of amplification . * the positional information carried by a linear morphogen @xmath1 with dynamic range @xmath29 and noise @xmath8 , which we call the `` raw information content '' of a gene expression profile , is given by @xmath30 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_\\mathrm{max}}{\\sigma_0\\sqrt{2\\pi e}}\\right)\\ ] ] ( see supplementary information ) .",
    "it depends only on the ratio @xmath31 ; for convenience , we define @xmath32 , which is an increasing function of @xmath33 .",
    "let us compare the two patterning strategies from the point of view of the raw information content carried by the controlling signal . in the direct strategy  ,",
    "the application of @xmath24 reduces the input noise to @xmath34 and so the controlling signal @xmath35 carries @xmath36 bits of raw information . in the two - tier strategy  ,",
    "the amplified profile @xmath27 is characterized by noise @xmath37 and its raw information content is therefore @xmath38    averaging mitigates the loss of positional information when using a noisy readout  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath25 is sufficiently large , the amplified and averaged profile carries even more information than the original input .",
    "( note that the information processing inequality is not violated , as it states only that the output can not carry more information than @xmath25 independent copies of the input . ) nevertheless , applying averaging directly to the input ( the direct strategy ) always yields more raw information ; thus , the multi - step scenario appears inferior to a direct readout .    in real systems , the three operations we treat as independent may be mechanistically linked .",
    "for example , if @xmath1 is an intracellular factor while spatial averaging requires a small diffusible molecule , then performing an extra readout can provide access to an otherwise unavailable averaging mechanism . by assuming that the two strategies   and   can benefit from equal amounts of averaging , which in our model simply reduces expression noise and is obviously beneficial",
    ", we can focus specifically on the effect of signal amplification .",
    "multi - tier patterning proceeds through rounds of amplification : small differences in input result in large differences in gene expression so as to establish increasingly sharp boundaries delimiting expression domains  @xcite , yet in our expression   for the information content of the amplified profile @xmath27 , the amplification factor @xmath17 cancels out .",
    "thus , considerations based on raw information content fail to explain the prevalence of signal amplification .",
    "* the benefits of the multi - tiered strategy lie in making the `` raw '' information more accessible . *",
    "the benefits of amplification and the advantages of the multi - tier strategy become clear when we observe that , due to the intrinsic noise in the regulatory readout , the raw information content is an inadequate measure of a morphogen s usefulness to the system .",
    "the purpose of a morphogen is to activate downstream processes ; the relevant quantity is therefore not the amount of information a morphogen carries , but the amount of information it can transmit to its downstream targets . since biological control is intrinsically noisy , the two quantities are distinct .    .",
    "outer error bars represent the signal observed by the noisy cell machinery ( corrupted by noise @xmath21 ) .",
    "after amplification , the relative importance of @xmath21 is reduced , increasing @xmath39 .",
    "* b : * the `` segmentation '' input - output function @xmath40 for integer @xmath17 ( here @xmath41 ) preserves the dynamic range of morphogen concentration .",
    "locations such as those indicated by dots now have identical expression levels of @xmath42 ( the @xmath43 axis ) , but can be distinguished using the input morphogen @xmath2 ( the @xmath3 axis on this plot).[fig : cartoon ] ]    our model was designed to make this particularly clear : since the system can never access the true concentration @xmath2 , but only a noisy estimate @xmath44 , @xmath45 $ ] is beyond the system s reach .",
    "we define _ accessible _ information in a morphogen @xmath39 as the amount of information the system can access in time @xmath12 : @xmath46\\equiv i_{\\mathrm{raw}}[c^{\\mathrm{est } } ] = i_{\\mathrm{raw}}[c+\\eta],\\ ] ] where @xmath47 , again , is a gaussian noise of magnitude @xmath21 within our model .    the amount of accessible information provided by the direct strategy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : argument]b ) is given by @xmath48 whereas for the amplified profile @xmath27 it is @xmath49 the amplification factor @xmath17 no longer cancels out in  ; amplifying dynamic range is beneficial , since it reduces the relative importance of the intrinsic readout noise ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon]a ) . comparing   and",
    ", we find that the extra tier of noisy amplification is beneficial if and only if @xmath50 note that the condition   is never satisfied if @xmath51 ( no averaging ) or @xmath52 ( no amplification ) .",
    "intuitively , our argument demonstrates that the patterning system is a mechanism that invests some effort into making a careful measurement ( @xmath53 ) and encodes this information in a more accessible format where steeper concentration changes ( @xmath54 ) can be interpreted with a faster , and therefore noisier readout . this mechanism is useful precisely because regulatory readout is intrinsically noisy ,",
    "otherwise direct readout would have been the better strategy . in other words , to understand the purpose of the patterning system , it is essential to distinguish between the total information in a morphogen and information that can be usefully extracted and interpreted .",
    "* multiple tiers improve gradient interpretation even when raw information decreases .",
    "* so far we considered the information content ( raw or accessible ) in each tier separately .",
    "however , in principle , downstream processes could access all patterning cues and not simply the final tier  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "extra readout tiers can be beneficial even when they carry very little information on their own .    to see this , consider the input - output function @xmath40 depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon]b . in some respects , it is more realistic than the purely amplifying linear readout @xmath18 considered above , since real patterning systems must operate within a limited global dynamic range of morphogen concentrations .",
    "let @xmath42 be the morphogen profile established by the new @xmath40-shaped readout of @xmath2 ; it has noise magnitude @xmath55 ( same as the noise in @xmath27 ) , but is folded onto itself @xmath17 times , reminiscent of the spatially reiterated expression of genes involved in _ drosophila",
    "_ axis segmentation . repeatedly using the same output values at multiple positions",
    "naturally reduces mutual information between the output concentration and position : @xmath56&=i_{\\mathrm{raw}}[c^{(\\lambda)}]-\\ln\\lambda\\\\ i_{\\mathrm{acc}}[z^{(\\lambda)}]&=i_{\\mathrm{acc}}[c^{(\\lambda)}]-\\ln\\lambda . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    however , the @xmath17 locations with identical concentrations of @xmath42 are made distinguishable by the original morphogen  @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon]b )",
    ". therefore , the _ joint _ information that the original and the amplified profiles together provide about a cell s location is the same for @xmath40 as it was for @xmath18 : @xmath57=i\\big[\\{c , c^{(\\lambda)}\\ } , x\\big]\\ ] ] replacing information content of a single profile by this joint information , our argument demonstrating that amplification increases accessible information can now be repeated verbatim  @xcite , and we again find that the extra readout is beneficial as long as   is satisfied .",
    "note , however , that on its own , @xmath42 may carry _ less _ information than the original morphogen @xmath2 .",
    "the easiest way to see this is to compare their noise levels : @xmath58 if the effect of amplification is stronger than that of averaging , we find @xmath59 . in this scenario ,",
    "the amplified profile @xmath42 has the same dynamic range but lower precision than the original morphogen @xmath2 , and therefore , on its own , carries less information ( whether raw or accessible ) .",
    "this shows that evaluating the usefulness of a particular cue from information - theoretic standpoint can lead to misleading results , unless all other relevant cues ( which are often hard to establish ) are taken into account simultaneously . here",
    ", we demonstrated that systems can benefit from multi - tiered interpretation even in cases where intermediate steps occur at a net loss of information , increasing noise .",
    "* the multi - tier structure of _ drosophila _ segment patterning increases information accessibility .",
    "* in this system , segmentation of the ap axis proceeds through four tiers of gene activity , termed maternal gradients , gap genes , pair - rule genes , and segment polarity genes  @xcite .",
    "the sequential activity of each tier subdivides the naive blastoderm into smaller domains of gene expression with increasingly sharp boundaries , culminating in the designation of each row of cells with its own unique set of expressed genes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : data]a ) .",
    "this process is subject to transcriptional noise with a large intrinsic component  @xcite , as well as several other noise sources with different signatures  @xcite .",
    "no single value of @xmath21 adequately characterizes such readout noise .",
    "nevertheless , we can gain important insight by computing @xmath60 $ ] as a function of @xmath21 , treating it as a variable parameter : the decay of @xmath60 $ ] with @xmath21 characterizes the tolerance to added noise of the information encoded in the morphogen ( or set of morphogens ) @xmath2 . applied to gene expression data from the early _ drosophila _ segmentation gene network , this analysis will show how our simple model explains the use of multi - tier gradient interpretation in a real system ( fig .",
    "4 ) .        we focus on a particular node in this network whereby , in early embryos , two gap genes , _",
    "_ kr _ , regulate a pair - rule gene _",
    "eve_. for @xmath61 , where _ kr _ and _ hb _ expression form opposing boundaries , they are jointly responsible for creating the trough between _ eve _ stripes 2 and 3 ; other inputs to _",
    "eve _ are negligible in this region at this time  @xcite .",
    "protein levels are measured simultaneously in each nucleus by a triple immunostaining experiment ( fig .",
    "[ fig : data]a ) in @xmath62 single embryos .",
    "we determine the expression noise of each gene by comparing levels in a given nucleus with those of its immediate dorsal and ventral neighbors ( see methods ) .",
    "in the defined region of interest , _ eve _ expression noise is higher than the respective noise in _ hb _ or _",
    "kr _ expression ( fig .",
    "[ fig : data]b ) .",
    "the information content of _ eve _ must therefore be lower than that carried by either of its two inputs .",
    "due to the curvature of the embryo ( fig .",
    "[ fig : data]a ) , the positional information of a real morphogen is only approximately related to that derived from projection onto the imaginary ap axis .",
    "therefore , to estimate the information content for each of the three genes , we consider `` idealized '' gaussian - noise profiles ( panel c ) with mean and noise obtained by smoothing the measured values in real embryos .",
    "the idealized profiles are normalized to the same maximum and are , by construction , functions of @xmath63 carrying positional information @xmath64 . restricted to the region of interest , the information content of hb and kr is respectively 2.6 and 2.7 bits , whereas the larger noise of eve reduces its information content to only 2.0 bits .",
    "why , then , does the system use eve to regulate downstream processes , rather than utilizing kr and hb directly ?",
    "the answer becomes clear when we consider the accessibility of information encoded in these morphogens , namely @xmath65 as a function of @xmath21 ( panel d ) . a patterning strategy lacking",
    "eve can access only hb and kr .",
    "even if some hypothetical filtering mechanism could reduce their expression noise to arbitrarily low level , the readout noise magnitude @xmath66 imposes an upper bound that @xmath67 $ ] must satisfy .",
    "this corresponds to the information in a hypothetical pair of noiseless hb and kr and can not be achieved in practice ; it is a theoretical best - case scenario for any strategy lacking eve .    when the readout noise @xmath21 is zero , @xmath65 coincides with the raw information content , which for perfectly noiseless hb and kr would be infinite .",
    "however , as readout noise increases , the performance bound becomes finite and drops quickly ( black curve ) .",
    "this behavior contrasts with the joint accessible information of the triplet ( hb , kr , eve ) ( magenta ) as calculated using the actual measured noise of each of the three profiles .",
    "the accessible information content in the triplet is , of course , always finite , but it is also more tolerant to readout noise : due to the steeper slopes of the eve profile , as @xmath21 increases , the accessible information content of the triplet ( hb , kr , eve ) decreases slowly ; importantly , more slowly than the black curve",
    ". therefore , a crossing point is observed , whose presence does not qualitatively depend on the specifics of the readout noise model ( e.g.  absolute noise magnitude can be replaced by fractional ) .",
    "remarkably , although eve is measurably noisier than either of its inputs , its presence enables the system to access more information than could have been extracted from hb and kr alone , even if these inputs could be rendered perfectly noiseless . in practice",
    ", the enhancers of the pair - rule genes also contain binding sites for maternal transcription factors  @xcite , which may lead to a further increase in the precision of gene expression .",
    "however , our framework demonstrates that even if eve were regulated by hb and kr only , and so were fully redundant in the standard information - theoretic sense , the additional tier would still confer an advantage , because transcription is intrinsically noisy .",
    "the _ drosophila _ patterning network has been described as performing a `` transition from analog to digital specification '' of cell identity  @xcite .",
    "the `` digital '' metaphor has its limitations : even for eve , the graded distribution within gene expression domains contains information  @xcite ; nevertheless , it expresses the correct intuition that the final pattern is more tolerant to noise .",
    "importantly , the standard information - theoretic formalism does not capture this intuition : for instance , the profile depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon]b has the _ same _ information content for all @xmath17 . noise tolerance  a critically important feature in biological systems  becomes manifest only when the readout process is considered explicitly , for example , as we have done in our definition of accessible information .",
    "this point is implicit in the theoretical work investigating the so - called `` input noise ''  @xcite , but has not been emphasized .",
    "this is because in a theoretical discussion of an abstract biochemical circuit , the quantities for which information is computed are easily postulated to be the complete input and the final output ; in this manner , valid theoretical results can be derived without a concern for information accessibility ( for some recent examples , see  @xcite ) . however , when information - theoretic arguments are applied to experimental data where the measured quantity is only an intermediate step , e.g. a transcription factor regulating downstream events , the question of information accessibility can no longer be neglected .",
    "for example , it has been suggested that certain signaling circuits may have evolved towards optimal information transmission  @xcite .",
    "although the argument is plausible , applying it in practice requires caution .",
    "consider , once again , the example of a developmental circuit .",
    "if the entire set of functional ( cell - fate specific ) genes were to be included into consideration , then information transmission from the input to this entire layer of functional genes would be a plausible objective function for this whole network to maximize , under some `` bounded complexity '' constraint penalizing solutions where hundreds of cell - fate specific genes are all controlled by highly complex enhancers with combinatorial , cooperative regulation .",
    "however , the usual , more economical approach does not consider the full set of hundreds of cell - fate determining genes .",
    "instead , it recognizes that the bulk of the patterning task is accomplished by a small subset of dedicated genes that engage in complex cross - regulation to establish the pattern that all other genes can then interpret simply .",
    "if we focus only on this core subset , the `` economy of complexity '' constraint is conveniently imposed by construction .",
    "we must realize , however , that maximizing information transmission to the target genes ( downstream of the patterning core ) imposes a different requirement onto this core circuit than merely efficient information transfer within the core itself . instead , the core circuit must function as a format converter , re - encoding information at its input into a format that can be accessed with a simpler and faster readout , that of a patterning cue by a functional gene .",
    "curiously , it has been shown that in small networks with a realistic model of noise , maximizing raw information transmission leads to network structures exhibiting features such as tiling of patterned range with amplifying input / output readouts  @xcite , i.e.  features that tend to also make information more accessible , even though the optimization scheme employed in these studies did not specifically consider the encoding format .",
    "this remarkable coincidence , however , should not obscure the fact that ultimately the two tasks  maximizing information transmission and re - encoding it in a more accessible format  could be conflicting .",
    "information theory is a powerful tool ; its formalism does not , however , aim to replace considerations of what constitutes useful information or how it might be used by the system . as it is gaining popularity in biological applications",
    ", it is important to remember that for a channel @xmath68 , the relation between mutual information @xmath69 and the ability to use @xmath70 to determine @xmath71 is only asymptotic : shannon  @xcite proved that it is the maximum rate of error - free communication via this channel , _ in the limit of infinite uses _ of the channel .",
    "importantly , in development and biological signaling , the number of channel uses ( e.g. integration time of the signal ) is fundamentally finite  @xcite .",
    "further , shannon s results assumed an encoder / decoder of infinite computational power  @xcite .",
    "this asymptotic rate is never in fact achieved in practice  @xcite , but in biological context , performance is constrained even further , since the `` encoding scheme '' is usually limited to measuring the same signal multiple times . in communication theory , this bears the name of `` repetition code '' and is formally classified as a `` bad code '' , i.e.  a code that does not attain shannon s bound even asymptotically .",
    "this means that extracting all the `` raw '' information from a signal is impossible even in principle .",
    "for example , a signaling pathway with capacity of 1 bit is never sufficient to make a reliable binary decision  @xcite , and therefore should not be conceptualized as a binary switch .    as illustrated here ,",
    "making the distinction between `` raw '' and `` accessible '' information will be crucial for understanding the architecture and function of patterning and signaling circuits .",
    "more work is required : our definition of accessible information relied on a simplistic noise model ; in general , quantifying the usefulness of information - bearing signals in contexts where channel uses are limited will require reinstating considerations of rate / fidelity tradeoff , which shannon could eliminate by taking the limit of infinite - time communication .",
    "nevertheless , information theory remains a most adequate framework to address these issues , provided it is extended to quantify both the amount and accessibility of information .",
    "our work provides a step in this direction and demonstrates how the extended framework naturally explains a global architectural property shared by diverse patterning circuits .",

    ", 17 images slices were obtained at a @xmath85 interval of 4 microns , spanning approximately 50% of embryo thickness .",
    "all data were collected in a single acquisition cycle using identical scanning parameters .        the immunostaining procedure described above yields confocal stacks of images where pixel intensity corresponds to the recorded fluorescence level .",
    "stacks were converted into projected hb , kr and eve images ( such as displayed on fig .",
    "4a ) as the maximum projection of gaussian - smoothed frames .",
    "the width of the averaging kernel ( 8 pixels , corresponding to approximately 1 @xmath86 m ) was smaller than the radius of the nuclei , therefore for pixels close to the nucleus center the averaging volume was wholly within the nucleus .",
    "smoothing frames prior to maximum projection ensured robustness against imaging noise .    in each of @xmath62 embryos ,",
    "the location of nuclei was identified manually . for each of the projected images (",
    "hb , kr and eve ) , we recorded the highest intensity value within 5 pixels of nuclei center locations as the fluorescence intensity in that nucleus . allowing for a 5-pixel `` wiggle room '' ensured robustness against registration errors across color channels , as well as against errors in the manual selection of nuclei center locations .",
    "the recorded intensity values were corrected for background autofluorescence by subtracting the mean intensity recorded in nuclei located in non - expressing regions of the embryo .",
    "the background - corrected fluorescence values reflect protein concentration , up to a proportionality factor ( intensity of a fluorophore ) . the fractional measurement noise in estimating relative concentrations can be estimated as the standard deviation of pixel intensity values within a nucleus on the projected map . in their respective regions of expression ,",
    "this standard deviation of hb , kr and eve pixel intensity constituted @xmath87 of the expression value and was therefore negligible compared to the expression noise observed across nuclei ( fig .",
    "4b ) . to avoid signal distortion artifacts observed at the edges of the imaged portion of the embryo due to tissue curvature and compression ,",
    "all analysis was restricted to nuclei located in the low - distortion region selected manually along the imaged embryo center line , typically 20 - 25 nuclei wide ( fig .",
    "[ fig : embryo8 ] ) .",
    "expression noise is defined as : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the recorded fluorescent intensity ( of hb , kr or eve ) , and @xmath90 is the expected value at that location . measuring noise therefore requires a method for constructing @xmath90 .",
    "we use a method that we call `` haltere - shaped filtering '' . to introduce and motivate this method , we begin by discuss two simpler alternatives and their limitations : binning by ap coordinate and neighbor averaging .        since gap genes expression is often said to be a function of the location along the antero - posterior ( ap ) axis",
    ", one approach could be to define @xmath90 as the average expression level in all nuclei with a similar ap coordinate .",
    "this approach , however , would yield strongly biased results due to the curvature of gene expression domains ( fig .",
    "[ fig : embryo8 ] ) .",
    "a better approach is to construct @xmath90 for each nucleus based on the expression levels observed in neighboring nuclei . since expression profiles are relatively smooth functions of location , the average of expression levels in nuclei that are immediate neighbors of nucleus @xmath5 provides a reasonable expectation for @xmath15 . despite being a significant improvement over the naive ap - based method",
    ", however , the simple averaging over neighbors provides an unbiased estimate only in regions where the profile shape is well approximated by a linear dependence . in all other cases",
    "this estimate will have a bias proportional to the convexity ( second derivative ) of the mean profile shape .",
    "this is particularly clear for the sharply varying profile of eve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : annulus]a ) .",
    "this bias can lead to a dangerous artifact , whereby sharply varying profiles would appear to be more noisy , which would be unacceptable for our analysis of the hb - kr - eve system .",
    "[ fig : annulus]b shows the inferred @xmath91 as a function of ap axis coordinate .",
    "the severity of the bias of the neighbor - averaging method of estimating @xmath90 can be measured by the clearly observed correlation between @xmath91 and the average profile shape of eve ( i.e.  @xmath89 ) .",
    "we now describe the procedure we used to construct @xmath90 for our analysis .",
    "we begin by creating an `` expression map '' whereby in the projected image such as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : embryo8 ] the value of every pixel is replaced by the expression level @xmath89 recorded in the nucleus closest to that pixel .",
    "the image is then filtered using a haltere - shaped filter depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : haltere]a , and pixel values at each nucleus after filtering define the values of @xmath90 .",
    "this method combines the better qualities of the two approaches discussed above . on a perfectly regular hexagonal lattice",
    ", this would be equivalent to the neighbor - averaging method using only the immediate dorsal and ventral neighbors , but the specific procedure we described naturally deal with lattice imperfections .",
    "in fact , @xmath91 in fig .  [",
    "fig : annulus]b was constructed using this exact procedure , but using an annulus - shaped filter depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : annulus]a . since the gradient of expression profiles is predominantly aligned with the ap axis , using a haltere - shaped filter",
    "greatly reduces any introduced bias ( fig .",
    "[ fig : haltere]b ) .",
    "one might expect that for even higher accuracy , the orientation of the haltere filter could be set not by perpendicularity to the imaginary ap axis , but by the isolines of the actual expression profile after sufficiently strong smoothing .",
    "however , in practice such an approach is functionally less robust due to the number of tunable parameters , and we empirically found the fixed - angle haltere filtering to result in the lowest bias as measured by the correlation of average @xmath91 in a region and the average @xmath89 in that same region .",
    "the expression profiles of long body axis patterning genes in _ drosophila _ form a pattern that , to a good approximation , can be considered one - dimensional . however , as discussed above , due to the curvature of expression profiles , @xmath63 is not the variable that best captures the variance . to estimate positional information in a gene expression pattern using data from single embryos",
    ", we therefore use the measured expression pattern shape and noise to construct what we call `` idealized profiles '' .",
    "first , we plot the recorded expression values @xmath89 as a function of @xmath63 and construct a smooth spline fit that captures the mean profile shape ; we denote the result @xmath92 .",
    "next , the same procedure is applied to expression noise , estimated as described above : the smooth spline fit to @xmath93 as a function of @xmath63 describes how the experimentally observed expression noise varies along the ap axis ; we denote this root - mean - square deviation function @xmath94 . an expression pattern with mean @xmath92 and independent gaussian noise of magnitude",
    "@xmath94 constitutes the `` idealized profile '' of a given patterning cue ( see fig .",
    "note that when calculating average noise magnitude for a given ap coordinate , expression noise is calculated as described in the previous section , i.e.  _ prior _ to binning by ap .",
    "the result is the average of expression noise measured locally for all nuclei at a similar ap location  as opposed to the variance of expression among all nuclei at the same @xmath63 ; the latter , as we described , suffers from artifacts .",
    "the procedure we described effectively straightens out expression stripes : the resulting profile has the same mean and noise magnitude as observed experimentally , but is , by construction , a function of a single variable .",
    "this approach contrasts with the procedure of  @xcite where embryos were imaged in cross - section and only dorsal or ventral `` expression profiles '' were used , i.e. expression levels were recorded along a _ particular _ ap line ( from multiple embryos ) . here",
    ", we use _ all _ nuclei observed on a slightly flattened surface of a single embryo , and the variation of expression profile shape with the dorsal - ventral coordinate becomes a major factor .      by definition , the information content ( or the mutual information ) @xmath95 of a profile @xmath1 is the average reduction of uncertainty of @xmath2 after @xmath3 becomes known : @xmath96 here the first term is the entropy of the full distribution of @xmath2 , which we denote @xmath76 , and @xmath97 is the entropy of the conditional distribution @xmath98 . we write : @xmath99 because the position @xmath3 is uniformly distributed between @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( in our case , @xmath102 and @xmath103 ) .",
    "these formulas express the information content of a one - dimensional profile entirely in terms of the conditional probability function @xmath104 .",
    "for the idealized profile , at a given ap location @xmath105 , the conditional distribution @xmath106 is gaussian with mean @xmath107 and width @xmath108 ; in particular , the entropy of @xmath106 is known analytically .",
    "therefore , we compute @xmath109 by numerically performing the integral .",

    "<S> , information theory is gaining popularity as a tool to characterize performance of biological systems . </S>",
    "<S> although is may not have become the `` general calculus for biology '' , as predicted by johnson in his 1970 review  @xcite , the scope of its applications has been steadily expanding : from the earliest work measuring the information content in dna , rna and proteins to topics like neuroscience , collective behavior , ecology , developmental biology , genetic regulation and signaling  @xcite . specifically in the context of biochemical signaling , several recent reviews make compelling arguments that the mutual information between input and output of a signaling pathway is not just a useful quantity , but is in fact the `` only natural framework '' for characterizing the performance of such systems . </S>",
    "<S> however , implicit in these arguments is the assumption that the `` output '' in question is the final target of signaling , the functionally relevant phenotypic trait . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , in biological applications of information theory information content is usually assessed for signals that constitute intermediate steps , most commonly transcription factors , for example , nf-@xmath0b  @xcite or drosophila patterning cues  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such signals , however , still need to be interpreted by downstream processes . therefore , the information they carry is useful only to the extent that it can be extracted and used by the system . as we will demonstrate , failure to recognize this can easily cause information - theoretic quantities to be misinterpreted .    to show this , we take the example of gradient - mediated patterning circuits . for a complex multicellular organism , the reliability of its developmental program directly determines the probability of reaching reproductive age ; therefore , low error rate and/or high error tolerance are likely to be key determinants of the structures of developmental circuits  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> why , then , are so many patterning circuits structured as a cascade of several signaling steps , each of which is susceptible to loss of information due to noise inherent in biological control ? </S>",
    "<S> we will see that treating information content of patterning cues as a one - size - fits - all method to characterize system performance erroneously predicts that a single - step readout strategy should be dominant in development . to understand the advantages of the multi - tiered architectures observed in real systems , </S>",

    "<S> * in many developing embryonic systems , cellular identities are conferred by graded input signals that induce dose - dependent gene expression programs as outputs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such graded inputs , termed morphogens , often function as diffusible molecules produced by a localized expression source  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> localized expression generates concentration gradients in a field of otherwise naive and identical cells ( presented in simplified form as a one - dimensional array in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : multitier ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> cells activate specific expression programs in response to the local morphogen concentration @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath2 correlates closely with distance @xmath3 from the source , such gradients carry a large amount of `` positional information ''  @xcite quantified via the mutual information @xmath4 $ ]  @xcite . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , a morphogen gradient carrying sufficient information could induce in each cell the gene expression program appropriate for its position , thus generating the required spatial arrangement of cell fates  @xcite ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : multitier]a ) . in the most straightforward model , </S>",
    "<S> assuming the input morphogen is sufficiently reproducible  @xcite , local morphogen concentration is directly interpreted by each cell , i.e. , the local input activates all genes required at a given position , with no additional cycles of gene expression modulation . a central tenet of information theory , the information processing inequality , </S>",
    "<S> states that each transmission or processing step can only reduce the total information contained in a signal . </S>",
    "<S> direct decoding might therefore be expected to dominate in early development as the optimal strategy for transmitting positional information . </S>",
    "<S> this expectation seems all the more valid given the widespread observation that the processes of transcription and translation exhibit considerable intrinsic variability , or noise  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus information loss in gene regulatory processes should be particularly notable .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , from the perspective of information theory , it is surprising that many gradient - based systems exhibit a multi - tiered architecture in which reiterated cycles of transcription and translation are required to attain patterning goals ( illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : multitier]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the vertebrate central nervous system , the unpatterned neuroectoderm exhibits a graded distribution of multiple diffusible signaling molecules . </S>",
    "<S> these signals subdivide the prospective brain into relatively large fore- , mid- , and hindbrain territories , which are then segmented into smaller subunits by additional signaling activity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar patterns of broad subdivision followed by short - range refinement are found during the specification of the vertebrate neural crest by reiterated rounds of extracellular signaling  @xcite ; in the formation of segmented muscle precursors ( somites ) by fgf and notch followed by short range ephrin activity  @xcite ; the dorsal - ventral patterning of the _ drosophila _ body axis , first by a gradient of nf-@xmath0b activity ( also called dorsal ) and then by members of the bmp family of secreted signaling molecules  @xcite ; and also in the fruit fly , the patterning of the anterior - posterior ( ap ) axis by gradients of diffusible transcription factors within the shared cytoplasm of the nuclear syncytium  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these examples and others illustrate a common theme where long range signaling gradients subdivide a large field into smaller domains , within which the patterned expression of secondary factors establishes elaborated patterns ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : multitier]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> since each cycle of transcription and translation introduces more noise , the widespread use of the multi - tiered architecture appears to conflict with the expectation that development should favor circuits exhibiting efficient information utilization .    </S>",
    "<S> this apparent conflict arises because shannon s information content of a signal  @xcite has two important limitations . </S>",
    "<S> first , the information content of a patterning cue or other biological signal is defined locally in space and time , whereas its interpretation is non - local , and instead occurs over time and frequently involves diffusive signals . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , the naive application of information processing inequality in these systems is incorrect , and the local , instantaneous information content in a signal does not in fact provide an upper bound for the performance of downstream processes interpreting this signal  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , the same amount of information can be encoded in formats that are more or less easy for the system to access , since the interpreting circuit is itself subject to noise . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the local information content of a signal is neither an upper bound nor a fair estimate of the amount of information this signal can `` transmit '' to the downstream circuit . </S>",
    "<S> this is well illustrated by the recent experimental work on erk , calcium and nf-@xmath0b pathways  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the output of any of these pathways is reduced to a single scalar , it is found to transmit very little information about the input . if the output is treated as a dynamical variable , its apparent information content increases considerably  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> neither of these quantities , however , can be interpreted before it is established what fraction of that information can actually be extracted and used by the system . here </S>",
    "<S> we use a simplified model to illustrate these limitations of what we call `` raw '' information content , contrasting it with `` accessible information '' that we introduce . </S>"
