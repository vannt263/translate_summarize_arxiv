    "the problem of the correct evaluation of neutrino single pion production ( spp ) cross sections is interesting by itself and also important for future neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "recent measurements suggest that spp cross section may be 20%-25% larger than what was assumed in the past @xcite .",
    "understanding of nuclear effects in neutrino interactions in the 1 gev energy region is still not satisfactory . in order to cope with the deficit of events in the low @xmath4 region experimental groups have introduced effective quantities like @xmath5 in charge current quasielastic scattering ( ccqe ) @xcite or very large value of fermi momentum in pauli blocking @xcite .",
    "these difficulties have the positive effect that neutrino cross section experimental results are more often presented in the form of raw data , which are only efficiency corrected .",
    "such measurements are free from dependence on the models implemented in the monte carlo generators of events but extraction of free nucleon cross - sections requires good knowledge of final state interactions ( fsi ) effects . for example , in the recent miniboone neutral current ( nc ) 1@xmath3 cross - section measurement on @xmath6 there were large carbon pion absorption and charge exchange nuclear effects @xcite .",
    "for this reason it makes sense to come back to old but relatively good statistics spp data on deuteron obtained in bubble chamber experiments in the argonne national laboratory ( anl ) @xcite and in the brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) @xcite .",
    "the big advantage of these measurements is that deuteron nuclear effects are easier to control .",
    "it was claimed that spp data from two experiments are in disagreement @xcite , because of different total cross - sections and shapes of @xmath7 .",
    "apparently it is true that the total cross - sections reported by the bnl experiment seem to be systematically larger than those obtained by the anl .",
    "but it should be noted that in both experiments there are large normalization uncertainties of the measured cross - section due to imprecise knowledge of the neutrino flux .",
    "it is therefore desirable to perform a careful simultaneous reanalysis of two sets of data and this is the aim of our paper .",
    "we notice that during the last few years several theoretical models have been proposed @xcite to describe the weak pion production off nucleon / nucleus .",
    "they were fine - tuned to the neutrino scattering data ( usually only to the anl data ) not corrected to the effects which we consider in this paper .",
    "the details of our approach will be given in the next sections of the paper , and here we would like to outline the main points :    1 .",
    "we focus on the @xmath8 reaction because for this process it seems to be reasonable to neglect a small nonresonant contribution . however , we notice that some of the current theoretical approaches include nonresonant background also for this channel ( see @xcite ) .",
    "2 .   we will include deuteron nuclear effects applying the approach from refs .",
    "3 .   in our statistical analysis",
    "we use the @xmath9 function with a contribution also coming from the overall normalization ( flux ) uncertainty , and this turns out to be important .",
    "our main result is that anl and bnl data are in quite a good agreement .",
    "we demonstrate this first by providing the value of @xmath9 for our best fits but then also using more sophisticate methods of checking the self - consistency of the two independent sets of data .",
    "we present our results in the form of a fit for the @xmath0 form factor .",
    "we investigated several parametrizations with two options : either keeping @xmath10 as a free parameter or fixing its value using the argument motivated by the partially conserved axial current ( pcac ) hypothesis . in the most standard dipole parametrization with the @xmath10 kept as a free parameter and with correction from deuteron effects included our best fit is : @xmath1 , @xmath2  gev .",
    "we also present two applications for our results .",
    "the first one is motivated by a need to evaluate the nc 1@xmath3 cross - section in the t2k experiment @xcite .",
    "we will estimate the uncertainties of the nc 1@xmath3 cross - section . in order to make the evaluation realistic",
    ", we will use two different monte carlo event generators with all the nuclear effects included .",
    "the second application is a comparison with recent measurements of the cc1@xmath11/ccqe ratio done by miniboone on the ch@xmath12 target @xcite .",
    "this measurement is particulary important because it is free from the flux normalization uncertainty .",
    "we obtain good agreement with the data .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "2 contains basic definitions and notation , and in sec .",
    "3 we introduce various parametrizations of the axial form factors . in sect .",
    "4 we describe our approach to treat deuteron nuclear effects . sec .",
    "5 is the most important , as we present the methodology of our analysis : we define @xmath9 and for completeness we provide all the necessary information about the form in which anl and bnl data are given and used in our numerical analysis . in sec .",
    "6 we show our results for various parameterizatons of the axial form factor .",
    "the complete set of results is given in tables .",

    "8 contains our final remarks .",
    "we analyze the experimental data for the charged current ( cc ) neutrino - proton reaction : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote neutrino , muon , proton and @xmath18 resonance four - momenta .",
    "the four - momentum transfer and its square are @xmath19 and the hadronic invariant mass is @xmath20    one way to describe the reaction ( [ process_cc ] ) is to apply the adler - rarita - schwinger formalism .",
    "the final hadronic state is a 3/2-spin resonance described as a rarita - schwinger field .",
    "the transition from the nucleon to @xmath21 is given as a matrix element of the weak hadronic current , which has the standard vector - axial structure @xcite : @xmath22 both vector and axial parts are expressed in terms of several form factors .",
    "under general assumptions , the vector part can be expressed by means of three form factors , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 :    @xmath26\\gamma_5 u(p),\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 is the nucleon mass , @xmath28 is the rarita - schwinger field , and @xmath29 is the dirac spinor .",
    "the axial part depends on four form factors @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath0 and @xmath32 @xcite :    @xmath33u(p).\\ ] ]    the differential cross - section for the reaction ( [ process_cc ] ) reads @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the fermi constant ( for a neutral current reaction @xmath37 ) , and @xmath38 is the cabibbo angle .",
    "the neutrino energy is denoted by @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 are hadronic and leptonic tensors defined as :    @xmath42    @xmath43 is the @xmath44 width , for which we assume the @xmath45-wave ( @xmath46 ) expression @xmath47 with @xmath48 @xmath49  mev , @xmath50  mev is the charged pion mass .",
    "we introduce the amplitude for the @xmath51 weak transition : @xmath52    then the amplitudes for the other two channels for cc neutrino - neutron scattering are expressed in terms of the appropriate clebsch - gordan coefficients : @xmath53 @xmath54    a way to describe spp in nc neutrino - nucleon scattering was proposed in ref .",
    "first of all , the charge current and neutral current amplitudes are related through the clebsch - gordan relations : @xmath55 additionally , the amplitude @xmath56 is computed like ( [ amplituda_delta ] ) , but as an input one needs to apply hadronic current according to the recipe from the standard model : the vector part is multiplied by @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the weinberg angle , and the axial part is left unchanged @xmath59",
    "in an older analysis ( see e.g. @xcite ) an additional constraint on the vector form factors was imposed : @xmath60 as motivated by the quark model relations [ @xmath61 symmetry relation , for details see e.g. ref .",
    "the above relations describe the dominance of the magnetic amplitude @xmath62 , while the electric amplitude @xmath63 vanishes . with constraints given in ( [ su6_cv_limit ] ) ,",
    "the vector current is expressed by only one unknown function , which can be extracted from the electroproduction data .    in the original analysis of the anl and bnl data two parametrizations of the @xmath23",
    "were considered .",
    "the first one proposed by dufner and tsai @xcite ( applied to anl data analysis @xcite ) reads @xmath64 and the other one is of a simple dipole form , @xmath65    in our analysis we will use instead the recent experimental fits proposed in @xcite : @xmath66 where @xmath67    it is clear that the use of different vector form factor has an impact on the axial contribution as obtained from a fitting procedure to the neutrino scattering data .",
    "we will return to this point in the discussion .",
    "the main contribution to the axial current comes from @xmath0 , which is an analog of @xmath23 in the vector current ",
    "it describes the @xmath68 amplitude .",
    "similarly , @xmath30 is an analog of @xmath69 because it contributes to the @xmath70 amplitude @xcite . in the @xmath61 symmetry limit @xmath71 , @xmath72 and only @xmath31 and @xmath0",
    "are nonvanishing .",
    "the @xmath61 symmetry relations are only approximate , and they become broken by color hyperfine interaction .",
    "a lot of effort was done to compute all axial form factors directly from the quark models @xcite but the results do not reproduce the data sufficiently well .    in the phenomenological analysis",
    "there is no enough experimental data to extract all the axial form factors separately .",
    "therefore some extra constraints must be imposed :    ( i ) : :    typically one sets @xmath73 ; ( ii ) : :    the adler model @xcite suggests    @xmath74 ( iii ) : :    the pcac hypothesis implies    @xmath75    with @xmath76 being the pion mass .",
    "@xmath10 can be evaluated from the off - diagonal goldberger - treiman relation ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the updated value is reported in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath77 where the values @xmath78 and @xmath79  mev were used .    in the models presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , the value of @xmath10 is smaller than the one obtained from formula ( [ c5a_0_current ] ) .",
    "therefore it seems reasonable to use the experimental data in order to evaluate its value . in this paper",
    "we perform a comprehensive fit to the existing data on elementary interactions from anl and bnl experiments .",
    "the value of @xmath10 was already studied experimentally by barish et al .",
    "@xcite with the conclusion that @xmath80 is in agreement with the data with an accuracy of 20% .    in recent years",
    "the functional form of @xmath0 has been also a subject of intensive research @xcite .",
    "a possible parametrization of @xmath0 is based on a comparison of the rarita - schwinger formalism with the predictions of the adler model @xcite : @xmath81 with values : @xmath82    in our analysis the first ansatz for the functional form of @xmath0 will be as above .",
    "the fitted parameters will be either only @xmath83 or both @xmath83 and @xmath10 .    in the second fit we consider the simplest possible functional form , namely the dipole parametrization : @xmath84 again",
    ", we will fit either only @xmath83 or both @xmath83 and @xmath10 .",
    "let us emphasize that in both cases when @xmath10 was treated as a free parameter we kept the constraint ( [ c4_c5 ] ) .",
    "in both the anl and bnl experiments for most of the exposition the detectors were filled with deuteron .",
    "the nuclear effects for the @xmath21 production were discussed in ref .",
    "the final state interactions can be neglected and the effect comes from the fact that the target proton is bound .    in @xcite",
    "the deuteron wave functions were considered to be obtained in three different nuclear models : hulthen @xcite , paris @xcite , and bonn @xcite .",
    "the results of @xcite indicate that the nuclear effects for @xmath21 production are larger than for the quasielastic scattering , in which case the main modification is a reduction of the cross - section in the region of small @xmath85  gev@xmath86 due to pauli blocking while nuclear effects are negligible for @xmath87  gev@xmath86 @xcite . according to the results of @xcite in the case of @xmath21 excitation",
    "the nuclear effects are slowly varying with @xmath4 and they reduce the differential cross - section in @xmath4 by @xmath88 in the case of the anl beam and @xmath89 for neutrinos of energy @xmath90  gev ( a typical value for the bnl beam ) .    in our analysis",
    "we therefore assume that the neutrino ",
    "deuteron @xmath21 excitation differential cross - section in @xmath4 gets modified by a function @xmath91 with respect to the neutrino - proton cross - section : @xmath92 in general @xmath91 is a function of the neutrino energy @xmath39 , but for the anl experiment we use the result of ref .",

    "that we extracted : @xmath93    in the case of the bnl experiment we use @xmath91 evaluated at @xmath94  gev .",
    "there is an additional ambiguity in applying the results from @xcite because the calculated reduction of the cross - section depends on the model of the deuterium potential .",
    "we considered all three nucleon - nucleon potentials mentioned above .",
    "however , in this paper only results obtained with the paris potential are presented .",
    "the bonn potential gives rise to very similar results . with the hulthen potential ,",
    "the results are still comparable , but the impact of nuclear effects is smaller .    in @xcite",
    "early anl data on mostly hydrogen targets i.e. without nuclear effects , are presented .",

    "we can do this because in the analysis only the statistical errors of the experimental points are taken into account .",
    "the neutrino flux presented in the bnl papers @xcite was determined from measurements of qe events @xcite .",
    "the qe axial mass derived only from the shape of @xmath4 distribution with precision of 6% was used to calculate the total cross - section , and the observed rate of qe events allowed one to then calculate the neutrino flux with an uncertainty of less than 10% .",

    "a possible explanation is that in their case a @xmath135  gev@xmath86 cut would eliminate as many as @xmath127 15% of the events .",

    "the inclusion of the deuteron effects does not affect much the theoretical parameters : @xmath83 and @xmath10 .",

    "@xcite the statistical test , called parameter goodness of fit , devoted to verification of the statistical compatibility of different measurements is proposed . in the appendix a short summary of this method is presented .",
    "the parameter goodness of fit test measures how far from the global minimum ( of @xmath165 ) the minima of separate data sets are . applying this to our analysis",
    "we obtain [ see eq .",
    "[ chi2_pgf_appendix ] ] @xmath166 and the parameter goodness of fit @xmath167 [ see eq .",
    "( [ pgof_appendix ] ) ] .",
    "this means that anl and bnl data are fully consistent .    to illustrate our results we present in fig .",
    "[ fig_c5a_and_ma ] the global minimum ( denoted by an open circle ) with @xmath161 error ellipse and the minima obtained separately for the anl and bnl data , which are shown by black triangle and square ( with @xmath161 error bars ) respectively .",
    "all points lie in the close neighborhood .",
    "one can question whether the @xmath168% normalization uncertainty for the bnl neutrino energy spectrum is not too optimistic .",
    "we checked how much our results depend on this assumption and we repeated our computations assuming both uncertainties to be first @xmath169% and then @xmath170% .",
    "for the dipole fit with nuclear effects included , we obtained the following :    * 15% uncertainties : @xmath171 * 20% uncertainties : @xmath172    in fig .",
    "[ fig_c5a_and_ma ] we added 1@xmath173 curves for these two cases .",
    "we see that the considered modifications of the normalization errors only very weakly affect the obtained fit for the axial mass .",
    "the new central value of @xmath10 is in agreement with the one obtained before but the uncertainty becomes much larger .",
    "a general observation is that the increased normalization uncertainty enlarges the uncertainties of the form - factor parameters , and consequently , the cross - section uncertainties .",
    "however , we stress that rescaling of the normalization errors does not destroy the statistical consistency of the anl and bnl data .",
    "it is interesting to investigate what the 1@xmath173 error contours look like for different @xmath174 production channels in terms of cross - sections . in particular",
    ", one might study two channels that are most important in modern neutrino experiments , i.e. ( i ) @xmath175 , @xmath176 ( cc @xmath11 production ) and ( ii ) @xmath177 , @xmath178 ( nc @xmath3 production ) .",
    "the @xmath3 production is the main source of background in water cherenkov far detectors of long baseline neutrino experiments searching for @xmath179 appearance , like t2k @xcite .",
    "the nc @xmath3 events are however difficult to study exclusively ; one can try to study them by measuring @xmath11 production and extrapolating the results to @xmath3 production .",
    "in this section we will use fit results obtained previously to estimate cross - section uncertainty for @xmath174 production channels in the context of t2k experiment . for this purpose",
    "two software packages for simulation of neutrino interactions will be used .    the main simulation package used in",
    "this analysis was the nuwro monte carlo event generator@xcite .",
    "for resonant @xmath180 production this generator uses the adler - rarita - schwinger formalism for the @xmath44 excitation .",
    "the nonresonant part is described by fraction of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) contribution , applying the algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "nuwro is a generator in which many parameters can be specified manually , including axial form - factor parameters , which are of interest in this analysis .",
    "nuclear effects in oxygen ( neo ) have recently been implemented in nuwro and were used in this study .    as a reference , the nuance neutrino generator @xcite was also used .",
    "nuance is a widely used tool , tested in experiments with water cherenkov detectors like k2k and super - kamiokande ( sk ) .",
    "this appears to be consistent with the measurements of @xmath3 production in the 1kt near detector of k2k @xcite , as well as atmospheric neutrinos in sk @xcite .",
    "its implementation of nuclear effects in oxygen can therefore be considered trustworthy ( see ref .",
    "resonant pion production in this generator is calculated according to the rein - sehgal model @xcite .",
    "we decided to examine the fit that used dipole parametrization of axial form factors in which two parameters @xmath83 and @xmath10 were fitted ( see sec .",
    "[ section_form_factors ] ) .",
    "the error ellipse , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_c5a_energy ] , is calculated for @xmath21 .",
    "however , we can scan this ellipse , calculating nc @xmath3 production cross - section for each point on it , and find the minimum and maximum values ( which correspond to the 1@xmath173 range ) . by doing this for a broad range of incident neutrino energy",
    "we can obtain @xmath83 and @xmath10 parameters corresponding to the lower and upper 1@xmath173 bounds at each energy and then use them in nuwro simulations , which will allow us to calculate cross - sections for the channels of interest .",
    "the nuwro simulation package uses exactly the same form factors as the ones that were used in the fit .",
    "all simulation samples in this work were created using water as a target - the most suitable material when simulating interactions in super - kamiokande , the far detector of the t2k experiment . only muon neutrino interactions were taken into account as they dominate the t2k beam @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : ppxsec ] shows how cross - section uncertainty depends on energy of incoming neutrino .",
    "two sets of points illustrate 1@xmath173 bounds on cross - sections ( cf .",

    "it is seen that the differences are most notable in the low energy region . in particular at 1 gev the uncertainty for @xmath3 production is about @xmath182 .    in order to evaluate what neutrino energies are relevant for the t2k @xmath179 appearance search",
    ", one has to look at the typical energies of pions that constitute background .",
    "the oscillation signal from @xmath183 is peaked around 0.7 gev of the the neutrino energy @xcite .",
    "this means that dangerous @xmath3s have energy in this region .",
    "considering energies between 0.4 and 0.9 gev and using nuance simulation to translate them into incident neutrino energies , we get neutrino energy range 1 to 4 gev . we can then conclude that neutrino of such energies are the most important in the context of @xmath179 appearance searches in the t2k experiment .",
    "therefore the expected uncertainty varies between 6% and 10% .",
    "however , it is important to note that the errors discussed here come only from uncertainties in form - factors and do not take into account other model approximations , e.g. nonresonant background in pion production or an influence of matter on the width of @xmath44 resonance .",
    "we also notice that nuance predicts higher ( with respect to nuwro ) spp cross - sections on nuclear targets .",
    "this is probably caused by different assumptions for pion absorption cross - section at higher values of kinetic energy .",
    "this is a region where the experimental data for pion nucleus absorption are missing and monte carlo predictions have to rely on theoretical assumptions .",
    "recently there has been much controversy about the overall normalization of the neutrino cross - section .",
    "the miniboone and nomad experiments report very different values of the qe axial mass ( @xmath184  gev @xmath185 or @xmath186  gev with @xmath187 and @xmath188  gev respectively ) .",
    "for this reason the most reliable measurements are free from normalization uncertainties , and an interesting example of such measurements is the recent cc1@xmath11/ccqe ratio from miniboone . in the ref .",
    "@xcite two sets of data are presented , one for @xmath181 on the nuclear target ch@xmath12 and the second with evaluation on the same ratio on isoscalar nuclear target .",
    "we compare with the first set of data which is more independent on models contains in miniboone s monte carlo generator of events .",
    "the value of the qe axial mass used in the simulation was @xmath189  gev .",
    "in fig . [ ratio ] we see that we obtained quite good agreement with the miniboone data .",
    "the miniboone cc 1@xmath11/ccqe data imply that the values of qe and @xmath44 production the axial masses are _",
    "correlated_. if one increases in nuwro the value of the axial mass by 30% as suggested by the miniboone qe data , then in order to keep agreement with the measured ratio , the value of axial mass in @xmath0 would have to be accordingly increased .",
    "we have demonstrated that old bubble chamber anl and bnl spp data are self - consistent and restrictive enough to enable one to extract quite precise information about the axial form - factor @xmath0 .",
    "an important ingredient of our reanalysis was the inclusion of normalization ( flux ) uncertainty .",
    "we also took into account deuteron nuclear effects but their impact on the final result was surprisingly small due to the interplay with normalization factors .",
    "the evaluation of nuclear effects presented in ref .",
    "@xcite was based on nonrelativistic approximation and it would be interesting to perform exact computations and investigate how much this would modify the numerical results of this paper",
