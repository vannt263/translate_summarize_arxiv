    "the so - called `` rapid change model '' of a scalar field passively advected by a self - similar gaussian @xmath2correlated in time velocity field introduced by kraichnan @xcite and number of its extensions play the central role in the theoretical investigation of intermittency and anomalous scaling @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this is the experimental fact that the deviations from the statements of the famous classical kolmogorov - obukhov phenomenological theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) are more noticeable for simpler models of passively advected scalar quantity ( scalar field ) than for the velocity field itself ( see @xcite and references cited therein ) and , at the same time , the problem of the passive advection of a scalar field is much easier from theoretical point of view than the original problem of anomalous scaling in the framework of the navier - stokes velocity field . within the rapid change model of a passive scalar advection",
    "the systematic analysis of the corresponding anomalous exponents was done for the first time on the microscopic level .",
    "for example , in the so - called `` zero - mode approach '' to the rapid change model ( see survey paper @xcite and references cited therein ) the anomalous exponents are found from the homogenous solutions ( zero modes ) of the closed equations for the single - time correlations .",
    "one of the most effective approach for studying self - similar scaling behavior is the method of the field theoretic renormalization group ( rg ) @xcite .",
    "this method can be also used in the theory of fully developed turbulence and related problems , e.g. , in the problem of a passive scalar advection by the turbulent environment ( see @xcite and references cited therein ) .    in @xcite the field",
    "theoretic rg and operator - product expansion ( ope ) were used in the systematic investigation of the rapid - change model of a passive scalar .",
    "it was shown that within the field theoretic approach the anomalous scaling is related to the very existence of the so - called `` dangerous '' composite operators with negative critical dimensions in the ope ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite for details ) .    in subsequent papers",
    "a few generalizations of the rapid - change model towards more realistic ones were done .",
    "for example , in @xcite the field theoretic rg and ope were applied to the rapid change model of a passive scalar advected by the @xmath3-correlated , gaussian strongly anisotropic velocity field .",
    "it was shown that in the small - scale anisotropic case the anomalous exponents of the structure functions and correlation functions are nonuniversal and they are functions of the parameters of anisotropy , besides , they form the hierarchy with the leading exponent related to the most `` isotropic '' operator . on the other hand , in @xcite",
    "the influence of compressibility and large - scale anisotropy on the anomalous scaling behavior was studied in the aforementioned model and the anomalous exponents of higher - order correlation functions were calculated as functions of the parameter of compressibility .",
    "it was shown that the presence of small - scale anisotropy is more pronounced for larger values of the compressibility parameter @xmath4 . from this point of view , compressible systems are very interesting to be studied .    in the end , in @xcite the combined effects of the small - scale anisotropy and compressibility on the anomalous scaling of the structure functions of a passive scalar within the rapid - change model were studied by using the simplest possible generalization of the incompressible and anisotropic tensor structure of the velocity field correlator to the compressible one where compressibility was introduced only to the isotropic part of the anisotropic tensor structure . in present paper , we shall investigate more general case of the model where compressibility will be introduced through all anisotropic tensor structures of the velocity field statistics .",
    "first of all , we shall establish stability of the scaling regime of the model and coordinates of the corresponding infrared ( ir ) stable fixed point will be found as functions of the compressibility and anisotropy parameters .",
    "these results will be then used in the analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the single - time structure functions of a passively advected scalar field .",
    "we shall investigate the model of the advection of a passive `` tracer '' @xmath5 which is described by the following stochastic equation @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the laplace operator , @xmath10 is the coefficient of molecular diffusivity ( a subscript @xmath11 will denote bare parameters of unrenormalized theory ) , @xmath12 is the @xmath13-th component of the compressible velocity field @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is a gaussian random noise with zero mean and correlation function @xmath16 where parentheses @xmath17 hereafter denote average over corresponding statistical ensemble",
    ". the concrete form of the noise defined in ( [ correlator ] ) will not be essential in what follows .",
    "the only condition which must be satisfied by the function @xmath18 is that it must decrease rapidly for @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes an integral scale related to the stirring .    in real problems",
    "the velocity field @xmath14 satisfies navier - stokes equation but , in what follows , we shall work with a simplified model where we suppose that the velocity field obeys a gaussian statistics with zero mean and pair correlation function @xmath21 , \\label{corv}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the dimension of the space , @xmath23 is the wave vector , and @xmath24 is an amplitude factor related to the coupling constant @xmath25 of the model ( expansion parameter in the perturbation theory , see , e.g. , @xcite ) by the relation @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the characteristic uv momentum scale .",
    "the parameter of the energy spectrum of the velocity field @xmath28 is taken in such a way that its `` kolmogorov '' value ( the value which corresponds to the kolmogorov scaling of the velocity correlation function in developed turbulence ) is @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is another integral scale . in our uniaxial anisotropic and compressible",
    "case the tensor @xmath31 is taken in the following way @xcite @xmath32 where we denote @xmath33 , @xmath34 is common isotropic transverse projector , @xmath35 is the longitudinal projector , the unit vector @xmath36 determines the distinguished direction of uniaxial anisotropy , @xmath37 is a free parameter of compressibility , and @xmath38 , @xmath39 are parameters characterizing the anisotropy . from the positiveness of the correlation tensor @xmath40",
    "one finds restrictions on the values of the above parameters , namely , @xmath41 .",
    "the stochastic problem ( [ stoch1])-([corv ] ) can be rewritten in a field theoretic form with the following action functional @xcite @xmath42\\theta -\\frac{1}{2 } \\int dt_1\\,d^d{\\bf x_1}\\,dt_2\\,d^d{\\bf x_2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{-1.8cm}\\left ( v_i(t_1,{\\bf x_1 } ) [ d_{ij}^v(t_1,{\\bf x_1};t_2,{\\bf x_2})]^{-1 } v_j(t_2,{\\bf x_2 } ) - \\theta^{\\prime}(t_1,{\\bf x_1 } ) d^f(t_1,{\\bf x_1};t_2,{\\bf x_2 } ) \\theta^{\\prime}(t_2,{\\bf x_2})\\right ) , \\label{action2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are given in ( [ corv ] ) and ( [ correlator ] ) respectively , @xmath45 is an auxiliary scalar field ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and the required summations over the vector indices are implied . in action ( [ action2 ] ) the term with new parameter @xmath46 is related to the presence of small - scale anisotropy and the introduction of this term is necessary to make the model multiplicatively renormalizable .",
    "model ( [ action2 ] ) corresponds to a standard feynman diagrammatic technique ( see , e.g. , @xcite for details ) and the standard analysis of canonical dimensions shows which one - irreducible green functions can possess uv superficial divergences .",
    "the functional formulation ( [ action2 ] ) gives possibility to extract large - scale asymptotic behavior of the correlation functions after an appropriate renormalization procedure which is needed to remove the uv - divergences .",
    "epsf    = 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm    the ir scaling regimes of the model are given by the ir stable fixed points of the corresponding rg equations @xcite .",
    "the fixed points of the rg equations can be determined from the requirement that all the so - called beta functions of the model vanish and the ir stability of the fixed point is given by the requirement that all the eigenvalues of the matrix of the first derivatives @xmath47 , where @xmath48 denotes the full set of beta functions and @xmath49 is the full set of charges of the model , must have positive real parts . in our case",
    "the coordinates of the fixed points are given by the following system of equations @xmath50 for @xmath51 and variables with star denote the fixed point values of the corresponding variables .",
    "the explicit form of the so - called gamma functions @xmath52 is as follows @xmath53 where we denote @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the @xmath56dimensional sphere , and @xmath57 have the following explicit form @xmath58    epsf    = 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm    thus , possible fixed points are found as solutions of the system of algebraic equations ( [ betaaaaa ] ) and their ir stability is determined by the positive real parts of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath59 . using the explicit expressions for gamma functions ( [ gammas ] ) we have found the coordinates of the nontrivial fixed point ( trivial fixed point with @xmath60 is not interesting for us ) @xmath61 at fixed point the matrix of the first derivatives has the eigenvalues @xmath62 .",
    "it means that the point is ir stable if @xmath63 .",
    "it is also the only condition to have @xmath64 ( of course , together with the physical assumptions : @xmath41 a @xmath65 ) . besides",
    ", the fixed point value of @xmath66 must satisfy physical condition @xmath67 .",
    "this fact leads to restrictions on parametrical space of the model , namely , on parameters of anisotropy @xmath68 and compressibility parameter @xmath4 . for space dimensions @xmath69 and @xmath70 these restrictions are shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the existence of these restrictions is not present in the model with simpler definition of the anisotropy and compressibility which was studied in @xcite .",
    "further we shall use the above obtained results to determine the anomalous scaling of the single - time structure functions of the scalar field inside the so - called inertial interval which is defined by inequalities @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "they are defined as follows @xmath72^{n}\\rangle , \\label{struc}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 denotes the order of the structure function and @xmath74 .",
    "we shall not discuss details of the corresponding analysis .",
    "it will be given elsewhere but we only stress that the anomalous scaling is given by the existence in the model of the so - called dangerous composite operator with negative critical dimensions within the ope @xcite . in our case the main contribution to the anomalous scaling is given by the operators @xmath75=\\partial_{i_{1}}\\theta\\cdots\\partial_{i_{p}}\\theta\\,(\\partial_{i}\\theta\\partial_{i}\\theta)^{n}$ ] with @xmath76 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "our aim is to analyze the influence of compressibility on critical dimensions of anisotropic operators and to find the answer on the question whether the compressibility makes the anomalous behavior more pronounced or not , i.e. , whether the presence of compressibility decreases the critical dimensions of corresponding operators or not .    in fig.[fig2 ] , the dependence of the critical dimension of the principal eigenvalue ( related to the isotropic case , see @xcite ) of the corresponding matrix of critical dimensions of the composite operators @xmath82 $ ] is shown which play the central role in the asymptotic behavior of the structure function @xmath83 ( it is well known that the structure function @xmath84 has not anomalous behavior @xcite , therefore we start the analysis from @xmath83 ) .",
    "it can be seen that in the case of the structure function @xmath83 the anomalous scaling is present ( the existence of negative values for @xmath85 $ ] ) and the effect is more pronounced for more compressible system .",
    "detail analysis of the model for the structure functions of higher order will be given elsewhere .",
    "in present paper we have studied the influence of uniaxial small - scale anisotropy and compressibility on the anomalous scaling of the structure functions of a scalar field in the framework of the kraichnan model by using the field theoretic rg and ope . using the rg technique we have shown the existence of the scaling regime within the inertial range which is defined by the corresponding ir stable fixed point of the rg equations .",
    "we have found restrictions on the anisotropy parameters which are related to the compressibility of the system .",
    "the restrictions become larger when compressibility parameter increases . besides",
    ", using the ope we have found the asymptotic form of the structure functions and , using the concrete example of the third order structure function , we have shown that the compressibility of the system makes the effects of anomalous scaling more pronounced , i.e. , the critical dimensions of the corresponding composite operators are smaller in compressible case than in the incompressible case .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the compressible environment is more suitable for experimental study of the anomalous scaling of the structure functions of a passive scalar than incompressible systems",
