    "advection - dominated accretion flows ( adaf ) nicely complement the classic thin disk accretion flows ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; ichimaru 1977 ; rees et al . 1982 ; narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ) , and have been successfully applied to variety of cosmic objects , from galactic x - ray binaries to diffuse x - ray background ( see narayan , mahadevan , & quataert 1999 for review ) . however , analytic studies of adafs indicated the convectively unstable nature of adafs ( narayan & yi 1994 , 1995a ; see begelman & meier 1982 for radiation - dominated adaf ) , which has subsequently been proved in a series of numerical simulations ( igumenshchev , chen , & abramowicz 1996 ; igumenshchev & abramowicz 1999 , 2000 ; stone , pringle , & begelman 1999 ; igumenshchev , abramowicz , & narayan 2000 ) .",
    "especially , the numerical studies of adafs by igumenshchev & abramowicz ( 1999 , 2000 ) show that an adaf becomes a convection - dominated accretion flow ( cdaf ) whenever the viscosity parameter @xmath5 .",
    "further analyses of self - similar cdaf solutions show their unique properties ( narayan , igumenshchev & abramowicz 2000 , hereafter nia ; quataert & gruzinov 2000 , hereafter qg ) : the density varies as @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the radius ) , much flatter than the usual @xmath8 in an adaf or in spherical accretion .",
    "correspondingly , the mean radial velocity varies as @xmath9 , compared to @xmath10 in adaf or in spherical flow .",
    "energy generated at the inner part of the flow is transported to the outer part by convection .",
    "a cdaf has perhaps as much resemblance to the rotating stellar envelope of a massive star as to the usual accretion flow .",
    "the other aspect of the two - dimensional nature of adaf or cdaf solutions , often neglected , is the interaction between the outgoing radiation produced at smaller radii with the inflowing gas in the outer part of the flow . in optically thick stars",
    "this interaction plays a vital role in establishing the equilibrium states .",
    "the radiative interaction also plays a very important role in pure spherical accretion flows ( ostriker et al .",
    "1976 ; cowie , ostriker , & stark 1978 ; wandel , yahil , & milgrom 1984 ; park 1990a , 1990b ; nobili , turolla , & zampieri 1991 ; zampieri , miller , & turolla 1996 ; ciotti & ostriker 1997 , 2001 ) .",
    "park & ostriker ( 1999 , 2001 ) studied the same radiative interaction in the context of the adaf solution and found that a polar outflow can be generated through compton heating of electrons by high - energy photons emitted by the inner , hot part of the flow .",
    "the winds generated by the processes in the papers listed above are not momentum driven .",
    "rather , they are caused by overheating of the gas in the slowly moving , low density polar regions .",
    "outflows may also be generated from adaf by other hydrodynamic processes ( narayan & yi 1995 ; xu & chen 1997 ; blandford & begelman 1999 ) .    in this work ,",
    "we study the conditions for cdafs to develop radiation driven outflows .",
    "we adopt the self - similar cdaf solution as the background flow structure ( nia ; qg ) .",
    "the treatment in this paper is two dimensional , adopting the angular profile of nia and qg , except that the radiation field is simplified and treated as spherically symmetric .",
    "multi - dimensional numerical simulations and analytic analyses show that density and temperature profiles of cdaf follow a self - similar form in radius ( nia ; qg ; ball , narayan & quataert 2001 , hereafter bnq ) : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the radius in units of the schwarzschild radius , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the black hole mass in solar units .",
    "this shallow radial dependence corresponds to marginal stability to convection .",
    "qg further showed that the density should follow a power law in @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the angle from the pole ) while the temperature is constant on spherical shells .",
    "so we shall assume that the density is given by @xmath17 the flow extends from @xmath18 down to @xmath19 , with the outer radius ( analogous to the stellar photosphere ) fixed by energy balance considerations .",
    "the electron temperature @xmath20 in an accretion flow is determined by the balance between various cooling and heating processes . in general",
    ", detailed studies of hot accretion flows ( narayan & yi 1995b ; narayan , barret , & mcclintock 1997 ; bnq ) show that the electron temperature is equal to the ion temperature for @xmath21 , and then , at smaller radii , due to highly efficient relativistic bremsstrahlung and synchrotron emission , it flattens to somewhere between @xmath22 to @xmath0 , depending on the amount of direct viscous heating to electrons .",
    "hence , in this paper , we approximate the electron temperature as @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 is some constant between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .    from equation ( [ eq : rho_r_th ] )",
    ", we find that the total thomson optical depth along a given direction @xmath16 is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the dimensionless mass accretion rate . our analysis , which is to be applied to low accretion rate solutions , will assume that the flow is optically thin to both scattering and redistribution processes .",
    "the inner part of the accretion flow generally produces higher energy photons , while the outer part produces lower energy photons .",
    "hence the radiation field at a given position is determined by the contribution from inner radiating shells plus the outer shells .",
    "although in each shell , the density , and therefore , the emissivity ( i.e. cooling function ) is a function of poloidal angle @xmath16 , the energy density is more uniform over angle than is the emissivity .",
    "so , we will simplify the calculation of radiative transfer by assuming each radiating shell is homogeneous , using an angle average over the sphere .",
    "therefore , the radiation energy density at given @xmath12 , @xmath31 , is given by @xmath32,\\ ] ] where the first term is the contribution from inner radiating shells and the second term from outer radiating shells ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the emissivity per unit volume is denoted as the cooling function @xmath33 , which will be described in  3.1 .",
    "for relativistic un - comptonized bremsstrahlung , with @xmath34 and cdaf scaling @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the incremental luminosity @xmath37 , and the luminosity at a given radius @xmath12 has the largest contribution from the outermost shell .",
    "nevertheless , equation ( [ eq : exr ] ) gives a peak energy density in the inner region ( cf .",
    "_ dashed line _ in fig . 1 ) and a significant radiation pressure gradient .",
    "in addition , when there is strong comptonization , the contribution from the inner region can be significantly enhanced .    moreover , the amount of compton heating is determined by the luminosity times the photon energy , and is largely dominated by the inner hot region .",
    "the radiation temperature , defined as @xmath38 being the energy - weighted mean photon energy , at a given radius @xmath12 is determined by the equation @xmath39.\\ ] ] this quantity is more concentrated than @xmath31 , especially in the presence of strong comptonization [ see _ dotted curve _ in fig . 1 for @xmath40 .    in presence of an overheated wind",
    ", some region along the pole in cdaf will not be able to accrete matter , while the remaining equatorial region normally accretes ( see  3.3 ) . in most of the relevant parameter space ,",
    "the overheated ` funnel ' is very narrow , and we assume ( with regard to energy generation ) that the self - similar cdaf flow is filling the whole space including the polar region , omitting the small correction due to the solid angle @xmath41 ( @xmath42 sr ) occupied by the outflowing wind / jet .",
    "the resulting profiles of radiation moments and the radiation temperature show the aforementioned characteristics of cdafs .",
    "the luminosity , @xmath43 increases at large radius ( _ solid curve _ in fig .",
    "1 ) , while the radiation temperature is roughly flat or decreasing slowly outward after peaking at some intermediate radius ( _ dotted curve _ in fig .",
    "the mathematical self - similar cdaf has zero mass accretion rate ( nia ) , and this , of course , corresponds to zero luminosity .",
    "however , the accretion flow must lose energy by radiative cooling , and this energy loss is very likely provided by the convective energy transport ( nia , bnq ) .",
    "we follow bnq to assume that the total luminosity of adaf is proportional to the mass accretion rate : @xmath44 where the convective efficiency @xmath45 , determined by numerical simulations to be in the range @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the fraction of convected energy to be radiated away by electrons . in subsequent examples ,",
    "we nominally adopt @xmath48 ( bnq ) .",
    "we also tried smaller values of @xmath49 or a scaling of @xmath49 with @xmath50 ( cf .",
    " 3.3 ) , and the results were qualitatively the same .",
    "we determine the outer boundary for a given mass accretion rate @xmath51 by finding the radius @xmath18 at which equation ( [ eq : lvsmdot ] ) is satisfied .",
    "this gives a somewhat different relation between the total luminosity and the mass accretion rate from that in bnq because we have used comptonized relativistic bremsstrahlung ( and synchrotron ) while bnq employ only un - comptonized non - relativistic bremsstrahlung .",
    "however , the general characteristic of the relation is the same : higher mass accretion flows have smaller outer boundary radii .",
    "this is due to the special radial profile of density in cdaf solutions .",
    "because of the weak density gradient with radius , most of the luminosity contribution is from the outer part of the flow , which makes cdaf flows quite distinct from other accretion flows including adafs .",
    "the dimensionless total luminosity , @xmath52 , is directly proportional to the dimensionless mass accretion rate @xmath53 by equation ( [ eq : lvsmdot ] ) while the luminosity accumulated from bremsstrahlung is very roughly proportional to @xmath54 ( with a higher power in @xmath50 if comptonization is important ) .",
    "since these two luminosities must be equal , a higher @xmath50 flow implies a smaller @xmath18 ( see _ solid lines _ in fig .",
    "therefore lower mass accretion rate cdaf solutions have lower luminosity , yet are more extended , if we treat @xmath49 as fixed , independent of @xmath50 .",
    "the main cooling mechanism we consider in this work is comptonized bremsstrahlung and comptonized synchrotron .",
    "we first focus on the comptonized bremsstrahlung .",
    "this process is not only the source of electron cooling but also the source of the compton heating radiation field .",
    "the comptonized bremsstrahlung cooling rate per unit volume can be reasonably approximated by ( svensson 1982 ; stepney & guilbert 1983 ) @xmath55,\\ ] ] where @xmath56            \\quad\\hbox{for}~~ \\theta_e > 1 \\nonumber\\\\     f_{ee } & = & \\frac{5}{6\\pi^{3/2}}(44 - 3\\pi^2)\\theta_e^{3/2 }                  ( 1 + 1.1\\theta_e+\\theta_e^2 - 1.25\\theta_e^{5/2 } )            \\quad\\hbox{for}~~ \\theta_e",

    ", we assume pure hydrogen gas .",
    "the emitted bremsstrahlung photons are upscattered by inverse compton scattering .",
    "the amplification of photon energy by single scattering is @xmath62 .",
    "the probability of single scattering is @xmath63 ( see e.g. , dermer et al .",
    ". therefore the mean amplification factor by compton scattering would be @xmath64 the fraction @xmath65 of photons remain unscattered while the fraction @xmath66 of photons are upscattered to @xmath67 times their initial energy .",
    "this prescription is valid only for a single scattering comptonization .",
    "since most cdaf flow considered here has @xmath68 , we use this amplification factor for comptonized bremsstrahlung . although dermer et al .",
    "( 1991 ) provides a handy formula for @xmath69 , applicable to diverse regimes , it can give incorrect values for @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the main parameter regime of cdaf .",
    "although @xmath72 is a hard - to - define quantity in a complex flow , we simply adopt @xmath73 in this work for the purpose of estimating the comptonization .    when @xmath74 , comptonization becomes saturated , and all photons that are not absorbed are upscattered to @xmath75 , that is @xmath76 where @xmath77 ( dermer et al . 1991 )",

    ", the temperature of the gas is determined by the balance between the viscous heating plus the convective energy transport versus the radiative cooling . however ,",

    ", the thermal equilibrium temperature can be higher than the virial temperature , @xmath111 the virial temperature is defined as @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the proton mass .",
    "once electrons are heated above the virial temperature , and therefore above the ion temperature , electrons are likely ( via collisions and instabilities ) to heat ions to above the virial temperature , thereby , creating winds , especially because the dynamical time of cdaf is much longer than the free - fall flow .",
    "therefore , we adopt equation ( [ eq : overheat ] ) as the condition for overheating and producing a wind .",
    "what equation ( [ eq : overheat ] ) means is that some region of cdaf will be radiatively heated from the background temperature @xmath20 to @xmath103 to achieve the thermal equilibiurm .",
    "however , as the temperature of the flow approaches @xmath103 , it will become unbound when the condition ( [ eq : overheat ] ) is met , and thereby producing the outflow .",
    "there is also a trivial , yet additional constraint for overheating : the radiation temperature must be higher than the virial temperature @xmath114 otherwise the radiation field will cool the flow .",
    "outflows will extend from the polar axis to the angle @xmath115 at which the equilibrium temperature is equal to the virial temperature , @xmath116 regions with @xmath117 are overheated to above the virial temperature .",
    "hence , the shape of the outflow is determined by the angle @xmath118 as a function of @xmath12 .",

    "too high @xmath50 makes the outer boundary so small that the whole region is isothermal , i.e. , @xmath91 , and the flow is not heated .",
    "the outer boundary is smaller for higher @xmath50 because radiative luminosity is proportional to @xmath132 while cdaf flows have a fixed ( assumed ) radiation efficiency , which makes the total luminosity roughly proportional to @xmath50 .",
    "the only way to reconcile this is @xmath18 being smaller for higher @xmath50 ( bnq ) . in a too low @xmath50 flow , comptonization is not strong enough to keep the radiation temperature high .",
    "lower energy photons from larger radii dilute the radiation field and flows are not heated . in figure 5 , we show region of space in ( @xmath50,@xmath25 ) where outflow solutions are successfully produced .",

    "so we searched for the critical value of @xmath4 below which @xmath160 is satisfied within the overheated region .",
    "for higher electron temperature of @xmath161 .",

    "we , therefore , conclude that the compton heated outflow is expected to be produced in cdaf if the viscosity parameter @xmath4 is small enough , exact value being dependent on the mass accretion rate .",
    "however , as already mentioned , the real convective motion near the pole is expected to be much smaller than the average convective motion in the disk , the compton heated outflow near the pole may develop even for much larger value of @xmath4 .",
    "another timescales we want to check are @xmath177 versus @xmath178 at the temperature of the background flow @xmath179 given by equation ( [ eq : te_r ] ) . only when radiative heating is greater than cooling , i.e. , @xmath180 , the flow is heated from @xmath20 to overheated temperature @xmath103 of equation ( [ eq : teq ] ) .",

    "this will lead to an increase in the total cooling rate as well as a decrease in the radiation temperature of the emitted radiation .",
    "increased cooling rate will reduce the outer boundary of the cdaf whereas decreased radiation temperature will reduce the compton heating , or even cool the flow if the radiation temperature falls below the electron temperature .",
    "so we recalculated the condition for overheating in presence of magnetic field for the flow parameters considered in fig .",
    "the treatment of comptonized synchrotron is described in appendix b. we fix the black hole mass to be @xmath187 .",

    "for the highest temperature @xmath120 flow , the production of the outflow is possible only when the magnetic field is less than 1% of the equipartition field .",
    "so we conclude that the compton preheated outflow is possible in the magnetic cdafs as long as the magnetic field is less than from 10% to 1% of the equipartition field .",
    "hot accretion flows like adafs have a number of physical characteristics that compliment the classic low - temperature disk flows . in previous work",
    ", we have explored the consequences of the high temperature and the two - dimensional density structure of these flows , and have found that adafs may be able to produce radiatively driven outflows .",
    "we subsequently have noted that self - similar cdafs have even more suitable properties for producing outflows as compared to adafs : steeper poloidal density gradients and higher radiation efficiencies . in this paper , we have studied the conditions for self - similar two - dimensional cdafs ( nia ; qg ) to develop radiatively heated polar outflows .",
    "we have found that cdafs produce enough luminosity and photon energy to drive polar outflows via compton heating for a reasonable range of mass accretion rate , or , equally , luminosity , as long as the magnetic field is less than from 10% to 1% of the equipartition field .",
    "when the electron temperature saturates around @xmath0 at the inner region , polar outflows are possible for @xmath189 for radiation efficiency of @xmath166 , where @xmath2 is the eddington luminosity .",
    "the luminosity range for which outflow exists is narrower for lower electron temperature flows and disappears completely for electron temperature @xmath190    \\2 . in most cases , outflows are well collimated along the rotation axis , with an opening angle typically in the range @xmath133 .",
    "if we , instead of taking efficiency as constant , assume that it is proportional to the mass accretion rate @xmath50 , the solutions are qualitatively the same but are more self similar , i.e. , opening angle and outer boundary ( in schwarzschild units ) depend less strongly on @xmath50",
    "outflow is more probable for small viscosity parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the treatment in this work is not completely satisfactory in the sense that the dynamics and the temperature profiles of cdafs are not self - consistently solved .",
    "however , it was not our intention to solve fully three - dimensional , self - consistent gloabl cdafs with proper consideration for all gas , radiative , and magnetic processes , which will be eventually needed to fully understand cdafs .",
    "rather , our goal has been to show that even in the framework of simple self - similar solutions , radiatively heated polar outflows appear as natural consequences of the physical characteristics of cdafs .",
    "this work is the result of research activities ( astrophysical research center for the structure and evolution of the cosmos ) supported by korea science & engineering foundation .",
    "let s consider an optically thin , uniform radiating shell with radius @xmath191 and the thickness @xmath192 .",
    "the specific intensity at radius @xmath12 ( @xmath193 ) in the direction of @xmath16 ( see figure 7 ) is given by integration of radiative transfer equation along that direction .",
    "if we denote the emissivity ( per unit volume per unit solid angle ) of the shell as @xmath194 , then the specific intensity is simply the emissivity times the path length , @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the angle between the ray and the normal of the shell . from the law of sines , @xmath197 .",
    "the radiation energy density , @xmath198 , is given by the integral of @xmath199 over the solid angle @xmath200 , @xmath201 equation ( [ eq : enu ] ) formally diverges when @xmath202 whereas the correct value saturates . in the limit when @xmath203 , the effect of shell s curvature has to be incorporated in @xmath204",
    "however , since the radiation energy density is calculated by the sum of contributions from discrete shells in @xmath12 ( eq . [ [ eq : exr ] ] ) , the divergence is automatically avoided .",
    "the angle - averaged synchrotron emission by relativistic maxwellian electrons is given by ( pacholczyk 1970 ) @xmath205 where @xmath206 , @xmath207 , and @xmath208 is a fitting formula ( mahadevan , narayan , & yi 1996 ) .",
    "when absorption is not important , the cooling rate due to the optically thin synchrotron emission is obtained by integrating the equation ( [ eq : ep_syn ] ) @xmath209    however , a large fraction of the low energy synchrotron photons are generally absorbed by synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "the synchrotron emission in the presence of absorption can be approximated as @xmath210 where @xmath211 is the fraction of synchrotron emission above the synchrotron self - absorption frequency @xmath82 which satisfies @xmath212 thus , we only consider the optically thin part of synchrotron emission as the cooling function for the gas and as a contribution to the preheating radiation field .",
    "locally emitted synchrotron photons are upscattered by inverse comptonization off hot electrons . here , we adopt a simple estimate of comptonized synchrotron , which is reasonable in physical conditions considered in this paper , @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the comptonized energy enhancement factor ( see e.g. , dermer et al .",
    "1991 ) for synchrotron emission .",
    "the enhancement factor for fully saturated comptonized synchrotron in the presence of absorption is @xmath215 ( see  3.1 for bremsstrahlung case ) .",
    "the synchrotron absorption frequency is compared with that for free - free absorption , and the larger of the two is chosen .",
    "the radiation temperature of locally emitted comptonized synchrotron is similarly @xmath216 where @xmath217 is the energy - weighted mean photon energy in @xmath218 unit .",
    "this treatment of comptonized synchrotron radiation is almost the same as that adopted in park & ostriker ( 2001 ) , except that the energy enhancement factor and the treatment of saturated comptonization are slightly improved .",
