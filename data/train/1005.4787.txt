    "the other @xmath20 is associated with the rotation of the lattice .",
    "we can use the notion magnetic field and rotation interchangeably , assuming that a harmonic confinement potential is applied to cancel the centrifugal effects of rotation .",
    "therefore , the nexus of condensed matter and optical physics is transparent ( since the effects of magnetic field / rotation have the same mathematical structure ) and different systems can mimic each other .",
    "the progress in setups contrivance used for creation of a rotating optical lattice led to systems with different geometries like square ( @xmath21 ) or triangular ( @xmath22 ) that can be analyzed in the strongly interacting regime.@xcite up to now two experimental strategies have been developed.@xcite the first one is based on direct imprinting a phase shift on the macroscopic wave function.@xcite the second approach called `` stirring '' is an adaptation of the rotating bucket experiment to a gas of trapped bosons.@xcite the latter method fails when angular velocity is comparable to trapping frequency @xmath23 .",

    "we address the question of evolution of the ground state phase diagram for the system with various angular velocities for square and triangular lattices .",
    "the inherent difficulty of dealing with bh hamiltonian appropriate for strongly correlated bosons originates from the non - perturbative nature of the model and the presence of rotation . to elucidate the quantum phase transition in optical lattices , where the kinetic energy scale is less than the",
    "dominating interaction energy and angular velocity is comparable to the recoil energy , we have adopted a theoretical approach for strongly interacting fermions @xcite to the bh model in a way to include the effects of particle number fluctuations and make the qualitative phase diagrams more quantitative.@xcite to facilitate this task , we employ a functional integral formulation of the theory that enables to perform functional integration over fields defined on different topologically equivalent classes of the @xmath0 group , i.e. , with different winding numbers . an inclusion of the winding numbers is unavoidable in order to obtain a proper phase diagram .",

    "in optical lattices the two main energy scales are set by the hopping amplitude proportional to @xmath26 ( that sets the kinetic energy scale for bosons ) due to the particles tunneling , and the on - site interaction @xmath27 .",
    "for @xmath28 the phases of the superfluid order parameter on individual lattice sites are well defined . on the other hand , for sufficiently large repulsive energy @xmath29 , the quantum phase fluctuations lead to complete suppression of the long - range phase coherence even at zero temperature .",
    "the competition between the kinetic energy , which is gained by delocalizing bosons over lattice sites and the repulsive interaction energy , which disfavors having more than one particle at any given site , can be modeled by the following quantum bose - hubbard hamiltonian@xcite@xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 stand for the bosonic creation and annihilation operators that obey the canonical commutation relations @xmath33=\\delta_{\\boldsymbol{r}\\boldsymbol{r}'}$ ] , @xmath34 is the boson number operator on the site @xmath35 , and the chemical potential @xmath36 controls the number of bosons .",
