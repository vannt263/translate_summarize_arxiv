    "let @xmath0 be a compact complex manifold and let @xmath1 be a ( singular ) codimension one holomorphic foliation on @xmath0 . from the dynamical point of view ,",
    "one of the most basic problems we may address is the following @xcite : does it hold that every leaf of @xmath1 accumulates to the singular set @xmath2 ?",
    "of course , for a positive answer we need some hypothesis on @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 . in @xcite , lins neto showed that the answer to the above question is positive when @xmath0 is the complex projective space @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( the case @xmath5 is still open , and much more difficult ) .",
    "our aim is to prove a similar result on any manifold @xmath0 , under some assumption on @xmath1 .",
    "recall that we may associate to @xmath1 its _ normal bundle _",
    "@xmath6 : the foliation is locally defined by integrable holomorphic 1-forms @xmath7 , with zero set of codimension at least two , and so @xmath6 is the holomorphic line bundle defined by the cocycle @xmath8 given by @xmath9 .",
    "our feeling is that @xmath6 should reflect some dynamical properties of @xmath1 .",
    "a first instance of this philosophy is the result of @xcite concerning the existence of loops with hyperbolic holonomy : by an easy `` regularisation '' of their proof , one can see that such a result holds under the sole assumption that @xmath6 is _",
    "ample_. other results involving some form of positivity of @xmath6 can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let us put forward a conjecture .",
    "[ conj1 ] let @xmath0 be a compact connected complex manifold of dimension @xmath10 , and let @xmath1 be a codimension one holomorphic foliation on @xmath0 whose normal bundle @xmath6 is ample .",
    "then every leaf of @xmath1 accumulates to @xmath2 .",
    "note that by baum - bott formula @xcite the ampleness of @xmath6 implies , at least , that @xmath2 is not empty ; we shall return later on this point .",
    "if @xmath11 , or more generally if @xmath0 admits an hermitian metric of positive curvature , then the ampleness hypothesis is automatically satisfied , because @xmath6 is , outside the singular set , a quotient of @xmath12 and therefore it is more positive than @xmath12 .",
    "hence the above conjecture would extend the result of @xcite . however , there are many cases in which we can guarantee that @xmath6 is ample even if @xmath12 is far from positive , for exemple when @xmath0 is a complete intersection ( of dimension at least 3 ) in @xmath13 ( indeed , @xmath14 by lefschetz and thus either @xmath6 is ample or @xmath15 is effective , but the latter is excluded by @xmath16 ) .",
    "unfortunately , we are unable to prove the above conjecture in full generality .",
    "suppose that conjecture [ conj1 ] does not hold : then there exists a nonempty compact subset @xmath17 which is invariant by @xmath1 and disjoint from @xmath18 .",
    "we shall prove that such a @xmath19 can not be a sufficiently smooth real hypersurface .",
    "more precisely , and more generally :    [ thm1 ] let @xmath0 be a compact connected khler manifold of dimension @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath20 be a closed real hypersurface of class @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "suppose that on some neighbourhood @xmath23 of @xmath24 there exists a codimension one holomorphic foliation @xmath1 which leaves invariant @xmath24 .",
    "then the normal bundle @xmath6 does not admit , on @xmath23 , any hermitian metric with positive curvature .",
    "it is perhaps worth noting that , in the situation of this theorem , the foliation @xmath1 is necessarily nonsingular around @xmath24 .",
    "we stated the result in a slightly cumbersome way because we hope that it could be generalised to a larger context , by `` shrinking @xmath23 to @xmath24 '' , in the same way as @xcite is a generalisation of @xcite .",
    "that is , suppose that @xmath20 is a sufficiently smooth levi - flat hypersurface ( i.e. , a real hypersurface smoothly foliated by complex hypersurfaces ) , but not necessarily invariant by a holomorphic foliation on a neighbourhood of it .",
    "it is still possible to define a normal bundle @xmath25 of the levi foliation @xmath26 on @xmath24 .",
    "it is a smooth @xmath27-bundle on @xmath24 , holomorphic along the leaves ; generally speaking , @xmath25 can not be extended to a holomorphic line bundle on a neighbourhood of @xmath24 , in the same way as @xmath26 can not be extended to a holomorphic foliation @xcite .",
    "however , it makes sense to say that @xmath25 admits a hermitian metric of positive curvature along the leaves of @xmath26 .",
    "we think that it is _ never _ the case .",
    "when @xmath11 such a generalisation has been done by siu in @xcite ; in that case @xmath25 _ does _ admit a metric with leafwise positive curvature , by quotient of the fubini - study metric , and",
    "so the conclusion is that @xmath24 does not exist .",
    "remark that if @xmath24 is real analytic then @xmath26 and @xmath25 can always be holomorphically extended to some neighbourhood @xmath23 of @xmath24 , and a metric on @xmath25 with leafwise positive curvature can always be extended to a metric on the extended bundle with positive curvature : the positivity in the direction transverse to the leaves can be gained by multiplying any extended metric by the factor @xmath28 $ ] , @xmath29 .",
    "thus we return to the setting of theorem [ thm1 ] .",
    "if @xmath24 is of class @xmath30 , @xmath26 can be extended at least as a `` formal '' object , i.e. as a @xmath30-section of the bundle of hyperplanes of @xmath0 whose @xmath31 vanishes along @xmath24 at infinite order .",
    "optimistically , one could try to construct a holomorphic extension using a sort of formal - convergent principle _  la _ hironaka - matsumura , and the leafwise positivity of @xmath25 .",
    "this is related to the vanishing theorem proved in @xcite and @xcite , and it remains to see if that vanishing theorem can be applied in our context .",
    "similar problems can be posed also in the context of conjecture [ conj1 ] .",
    "that is , one may ask about the existence of codimension one laminations ( not necessarily invariant by a holomorphic foliation ) whose normal bundle is leafwise ample . even in the case of @xmath11 ,",
    "this seems a still open problem .    in another direction ,",
    "we hope that theorem [ thm1 ] could be useful to classify levi - flat hypersurfaces in fano manifolds , at least under the assumption of invariance by a global holomorphic foliation . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath0 is a fano manifold ( i.e. , its anticanonical bundle @xmath32 is ample ) , then @xmath33 is more positive than the canonical bundle @xmath34 of the foliation . thus , if @xmath20 is a real hypersurface of class @xmath21 invariant by @xmath35 , then @xmath34 can not be nef , by theorem [ thm1 ] ( recall that nef + ample is ample ) . according to miyaoka and shepherd - barron @xcite ,",
    "this gives remarkable informations on @xmath1 , in particular concerning the existence of rational curves inside the leaves .",
    "eventually , all of this could prove that @xmath24 is smoothly fibered by compact rationally connected submanifolds of dimension @xmath36 , contained in the leaves . in a different context , the one of complex tori",
    ", a similar structure has been found by ohsawa @xcite .",
    "our proof of theorem [ thm1 ] follows the same path as @xcite .",
    "we proceed by contradiction , by assuming that @xmath6 has a metric of positive curvature .",
    "the main step consists in proving that the complement @xmath37 is then _ strongly pseudoconvex _",
    ", that is a point modification of a stein space .",
    "this step is by free in @xcite , in an even stronger form , thanks to the classical solution of the levi problem in projective spaces @xcite @xcite .",
    "of course , levi problem has a negative answer on most compact khler manifolds , and in our case we need a delicate glueing procedure of plurisubharmonic functions , which involves the @xmath21-regularity of @xmath24 . then we conclude the proof in two slightly different ways , one close to @xcite and the other close to @xcite .",
    "it is only in this last part that the dimensional hypothesis @xmath4 is used .    in the last section",
    "we discuss some possible ways to fill the gap between theorem [ thm1 ] and conjecture [ conj1 ] .",
    "recall that a complex manifold @xmath38 is _ strongly pseudoconvex _ ( or _ 1-convex _ ) if there exists a @xmath39 function @xmath40 which is :    1 .",
    "exhaustive , i.e. @xmath41 is compact for every @xmath42 ; 2 .",
    "strictly plurisubharmonic , i.e. @xmath43 , outside a compact subset .",
    "classical results by grauert and remmert @xcite say that a strongly pseudoconvex manifold @xmath38 is a point modification of a stein space @xmath44 : there exists a proper holomorphic map @xmath45 and a finite subset @xmath46 such that @xmath47 is an isomorphism between @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the _ exceptional subset _",
    "@xmath50 is the maximal compact analytic subset of @xmath38 of positive dimension .    before starting the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] ,",
    "let us recall the well - known and easy proof of the following model case : if @xmath0 is a compact connected complex manifold and @xmath51 is a ( smooth ) complex hypersurface whose normal bundle @xmath52 is ample ( on @xmath53 ) , then @xmath54 is strongly pseudoconvex .",
    "indeed , by the adjunction formula @xmath52 may be identified with @xmath55 , and so we may construct on @xmath56 a hermitian metric whose curvature is positive on some neighbourhood of @xmath53 .",
    "the line bundle @xmath56 has a global holomorphic section @xmath57 on @xmath0 , which vanishes exactly on @xmath53 .",
    "then the function @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the above metric , is an exhaustion of @xmath54 and is strictly plurisubharmonic close to @xmath53 . here",
    "@xmath60 plays the role of distance from @xmath53 , and below we shall need to find a good substitute for it in our context . see also @xcite and @xcite ( without mentioning oka ... ) .",
    "consider @xmath0 , @xmath24 , @xmath1 as in theorem [ thm1 ] , and suppose by contradiction that @xmath6 has , on some neighbourhood @xmath23 of @xmath24 , a hermitian metric with positive curvature @xmath61 . in this section",
    "we shall prove :    [ prop1 ] @xmath37 is strongly pseudoconvex .",
    "we may assume that @xmath24 is connected and , up to taking a double covering , orientable ; hence , up to reducing @xmath23 , @xmath62 has two connected components @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we may choose @xmath23 so that it is covered by a finite number of charts @xmath65 adapted to the foliation , @xmath66 , and @xmath24 cuts each @xmath67 along @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is a proper arc of class @xmath21 .",
    "thus @xmath70 has two connected components @xmath71 and @xmath72 , contained respectively in @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we have @xmath73 and @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the two connected components of @xmath77 .    for each @xmath78 ,",
    "choose a biholomorphism @xmath79 sending the arc @xmath80 to the arc @xmath81 .",
    "this is possible thanks to a classical result by carathodory @xcite concerning the boundary extension of conformal maps between jordan domains .",
    "moreover , thanks to an as much as classical result by kellogg and warschawski @xcite , the map @xmath82 ( and its inverse ) is of class @xmath21 up to the boundary .",
    "more precisely , @xmath82 extends to a @xmath21-diffeomorphism between @xmath83 and @xmath84 . in the following",
    "we shall need only the @xmath39 ( or even @xmath85 ) regularity , but generally speaking kellogg - warschawski s theorem does not hold in the limit case @xmath86 , whence our assumption @xmath87 instead of @xmath88 .",
    "then we define @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the natural projection along the leaves .",
    "hence @xmath91 is holomorphic in @xmath71 and of class @xmath39 up to @xmath92 .",
    "its differential @xmath93 is a holomorphic 1-form on @xmath71 vanishing on @xmath1 , thus a holomorphic section of @xmath94 over @xmath71 . as a section of @xmath94",
    ", @xmath93 is nowhere vanishing in @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , it extends to @xmath95 as a section of class @xmath96 , and also on @xmath95 it is nowhere vanishing .    finally we define @xmath97 where @xmath98 is computed using the dual norm on @xmath94 , induced by the norm with positive curvature on @xmath6 .",
    "let us list some properties of these functions @xmath99 .    *",
    "( 1 ) * first of all , @xmath99 is well defined because @xmath93 does not vanish on @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , @xmath100 tends to zero when approaching @xmath95 , whereas @xmath98 has a finite nonzero limit , hence @xmath101    * ( 2 ) * we may write @xmath102 and observe that the second term is plurisubharmonic whereas the @xmath103 of the first term equals the curvature @xmath61 of @xmath6 , therefore @xmath104    now we want to glue the functions @xmath99 , and so we need to estimate their differences @xmath105 on @xmath106 .",
    "set @xmath107 .",
    "then , for every @xmath108 , we have a biholomorphism @xmath109 such that @xmath110    hence @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and so @xmath113        now , by schwarz reflection the biholomorphism @xmath114 extends beyond the parts of the boundaries of @xmath115 and @xmath116 along @xmath117 .",
    "moreover , this extension sends the real axis into itself , and so @xmath118 is real on @xmath117 and equal to @xmath119 there .",
    "it follows that the function @xmath120 appearing in the above expression of @xmath121 is real analytic up to @xmath122 and equal to 0 there . as a consequence of this :    * ( 3 )",
    "* @xmath123    * ( 4 ) * @xmath124 of course , all these estimates hold in a uniform way .",
    "note that in ( 4 ) we use the fact that @xmath125 is of class @xmath96 up to @xmath126 .",
    "we are now ready to construct our exhaustion of @xmath37 .",
    "take a partition of unity @xmath127 adapted to @xmath128 : each @xmath129 is a nonnegative smooth function with compact support in @xmath67 , and @xmath130 around @xmath24 .",
    "define @xmath131 we obviously have @xmath132 as @xmath133 ( uniformly ) , by property ( 1 ) above .",
    "[ lemma1 ] on a sufficiently small neighbourhood of @xmath24 , the function @xmath134 has no critical point , and the kernel @xmath135 of @xmath136 uniformly converges to @xmath137 as @xmath138",
    ".    let us work , to fix notation , in the chart @xmath139 .",
    "the @xmath31-derivative of @xmath134 can be written as @xmath140 the second term tends to 0 as @xmath141 tends to @xmath24 , by property ( 3 ) .",
    "for the first term , we compute @xmath142 the 1-form @xmath143 stays bounded as @xmath141 tends to @xmath24 , because @xmath91 is of class @xmath39 up to @xmath24 and @xmath93 does not vanish on @xmath24 .",
    "the 1-form @xmath144 is , on the contrary , divergent as @xmath133 , and moreover its kernel coincides with the one of @xmath93 , i.e. @xmath145 .",
    "it follows that @xmath146 becomes closer and closer to @xmath145 as @xmath141 approaches to @xmath24 .",
    "now we compute the levi form of @xmath134 ( still in the chart @xmath139 ) : @xmath147 @xmath148 by property ( 2 ) we have @xmath149 , and by property ( 3 ) we have @xmath150 as @xmath133 . by property",
    "( 4 ) , the 2-form @xmath151 is bounded as @xmath133 .",
    "moreover , @xmath151 vanishes on @xmath145 , because @xmath152 is proportional to @xmath153 ( see the computation above ) . by this and by the previous lemma",
    ", @xmath154 tends to 0 as @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , on a sufficiently small neighbourhood of @xmath24 we certainly have @xmath155 in other words , the ( smooth ) hypersurfaces @xmath156 , @xmath157 , are strictly pseudoconvex .",
    "it is then easy to find a convex increasing @xmath158 such that @xmath159 is strictly plurisubharmonic .",
    "after doing the analogous construction on the negative side @xmath64 , we obtain our desired exhaustion of @xmath37 , strictly plurisubharmonic outside a compact subset .",
    "the khler assumption has not been used up to now , nor the dimensional assumption @xmath4 .",
    "once we know that @xmath37 is strongly pseudoconvex , and @xmath160 , the proof can be concluded in several ways @xcite @xcite .",
    "first of all , we observe that @xmath161 is _ topologically _ trivial , because it has a nonvanishing section given by the `` unit normal to @xmath24 '' ( as before , we may assume that @xmath24 is orientable ) . hence",
    ", the closed ( 1,1)-form @xmath61 is exact on @xmath24 , as well as on a small tubular neighbourhood @xmath23 of it ; we may assume that @xmath162 is strictly pseudoconvex ( from the exterior @xmath163 ) , by proposition [ prop1 ] .",
    "thus @xmath164 where the primitive @xmath165 can be chosen of real type ( @xmath166 ) and , from @xmath167 , @xmath168    according to a theorem of grauert and riemenschneider ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.8 ) , and because @xmath169 , the second cohomology group of the strongly pseudoconvex manifold @xmath37 with @xmath170-coefficients and with compact support @xmath171 is equal to zero ( indeed , by serre s duality this group is isomorphic to the trivial @xmath172 ) .",
    "this means that the @xmath31-closed @xmath173-form @xmath174 , defined on @xmath23 , can be extended to the full @xmath0 , as a @xmath31-closed @xmath173-form @xmath175 : firstly we extend in any ( non @xmath31-closed ) way , and then we correct the error using the vanishing of cohomology with compact support .    because @xmath0 is khler , so that @xmath176 by complex conjugation , we may decompose @xmath177 with @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "hence @xmath180 and therefore , setting @xmath181 : @xmath182    thus , we have found a strictly plurisubharmonic function on a neighbourhood of @xmath24 . but",
    "this gives a contradiction with the maximum principle : a maximum point @xmath141 for @xmath183 is also a maximum point for @xmath184 , where @xmath185 is the leaf through @xmath141 , and this can not exist .",
    "this end of proof is very close to @xcite .",
    "really , all the difficulty of @xcite is in the fact that there the form @xmath61 is defined only on @xmath24 , and a priori it is not clear how to extend @xmath61 , as a closed ( 1,1)-form , to a neighbourhood of @xmath24 .",
    "hence in siu s paper the ( 0,2)-form @xmath186 is not identically zero , as in our case , but it is only vanishing along @xmath24 at some order ( depending on the regularity of @xmath24 ) . thus , whereas we used basically only the resolubility of the @xmath31-equation with compact support to pass from @xmath174 to @xmath175 , siu needs a more delicate result ( proved by himself ) on the resolubility of the @xmath31-equation with growth conditions ( see also @xcite ) . in our case , as well as in @xcite , these difficulties disappear because , by assumption , the levi foliation on @xmath24 can be holomorphically extended to a neighbourhood of @xmath24 , and this provides the required extension of @xmath61 .",
    "let us return a moment to the smooth case mentioned in the introduction , in absence of a holomorphic foliation .",
    "as in @xcite and @xcite , the nonexistence problem is reduced to construct a plurisubharmonic exhaustion of @xmath37 with some additional good properties : this permits to prove a suitable vanishing theorem and then to repeat the arguments above ( or , alternatively , to extend holomorphically the levi foliation ) .",
    "the plurisubharmonic exhaustion that we constructed in the previous section fits into this general scheme .",
    "a slightly different end of proof is the following one , closer to the `` topological '' arguments of @xcite .",
    "consider the exceptional subset @xmath53 of the strongly pseudoconvex manifold @xmath37 .",
    "we may find an exhaustion @xmath187 which is strictly plurisubharmonic outside @xmath53 . the classical morse - type argument of andreotti - frankel - thom allows to push any compact real surface in @xmath54 to a neighbourhood of @xmath24 , using the gradient flow of @xmath188 ( and @xmath4 ) .",
    "in other words , @xmath189 is isomorphic to @xmath190 .    hence the closed ( 1,1)-form @xmath61 ( which , as before , can be extended to the full @xmath0 , by pseudoconvexity ) is exact not only on @xmath23 but even on @xmath54",
    ". by the @xmath191-lemma",
    ", we therefore obtain @xmath192 where @xmath193 are the irreducible components of @xmath53 of codimension one , @xmath194 are complex numbers , and @xmath195 is a suitable current , smooth outside @xmath196 .",
    "in particular , around @xmath24 we have @xmath197 , and we conclude as before by the maximum principle .",
    "in fact , this second proof is equivalent to the first one : we have simply replaced the hodge symmetry by the @xmath191-lemma , but the former is also a consequence of the latter .",
    "in trying to extend the previous proof of theorem [ thm1 ] to the more general context of conjecture [ conj1 ] , one is faced with two main difficulties .",
    "suppose that conjecture [ conj1 ] does not hold , and so let @xmath17 be a compact subset invariant by @xmath35 and disjoint from @xmath2 .",
    "we would like to prove that , thanks to the ampleness of @xmath6 , @xmath198 is strongly pseudoconvex .",
    "we cover @xmath19 by charts @xmath67 , where @xmath1 is defined by @xmath199 .",
    "then , on each @xmath200 , with @xmath201 , we take the function @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the `` transverse '' distance from @xmath204 , measured with @xmath91 , that is @xmath205 the functions @xmath99 that we used in section 2 should be understood as special regularisations of these functions @xmath99 .",
    "it is easily checked that these @xmath206 satisfy properties similar to ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of section 2 .",
    "however , property ( 4 ) is a more delicate matter , due to the irregular behaviour of @xmath203 .",
    "let us see an example .",
    "take , in the disc @xmath207 , the closed subset @xmath208 .",
    "take two holomorphic embeddings @xmath209 , and let @xmath210 be the corresponding distance functions from @xmath211 .",
    "each @xmath212 is not @xmath96 along an arc @xmath69 starting at @xmath213 with a tangent of argument @xmath214 , the equidistant arc from the two branches of @xmath211 .",
    "typically , these arcs @xmath215 and @xmath216 bound ( near the origin ) a sector @xmath217 adherent to @xmath213 , over which the logarithmic differentials of @xmath218 and @xmath219 are very far each other : one of them is close to @xmath220 , the other is close to @xmath221 .",
    "thus @xmath222 is unbounded , on any neighbourhood of @xmath213 .",
    "if we replace @xmath211 by a curve @xmath223 of class @xmath21 , the situation is not much better : @xmath224 are then of class @xmath21 up to @xmath223 , but their quotient is probably no more than @xmath225 along @xmath223 , and we do nt see how to bound @xmath226 .",
    "related problems appear in trying to extend lemma [ lemma1 ]",
    ". however , our glueing procedure is rather rudimentary , and one could suspect that a more refined glueing procedure would work under the sole assumptions ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) of section 2 .",
    "suppose now that , in some way , we have proved that @xmath198 is strongly pseudoconvex .",
    "the second difficulty is that in section 3 we used the fact that the 2-form @xmath61 , representing @xmath6 , is exact around @xmath24 .",
    "we do nt know if such a fact holds for a more general @xmath19 .",
    "but @xcite suggests an alternative approach .    by baum - bott formula @xcite",
    ", the cohomology class @xmath227 is localized in @xmath228 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath229 are the irreducible components of @xmath230 of codimension two , then @xmath227 is cohomologous to @xmath231 $ ] , for suitable complex numbers @xmath232 ( the baum - bott residus along @xmath233 ) . by the @xmath191-lemma we therefore have @xmath234 for a suitable current @xmath235 of bidegree ( 1,1 ) .",
    "if @xmath4 , the components @xmath233 are positive dimensional , and being disjoint from @xmath19 they are necessarily contained in the exceptional subset @xmath236 .",
    "hence , under the canonical contraction @xmath237 , which collapses each connected component of @xmath53 to a point , each @xmath233 is also collapsed to a point , whence the direct image by @xmath47 of the current @xmath238 is vanishing . that is , @xmath239 where @xmath240 .",
    "this seems a quite strange and unlikely situation .",
    "indeed , @xmath61 is a khler form ( here we are assuming @xmath6 ample on the full @xmath0 , not only around @xmath19 ) , and we find unlikely that by a modification the strictly positive ( 2,2)-form @xmath241 may become @xmath191-exact .",
    "this is certainly not the case if @xmath242 is , as @xmath0 , projective .",
    "however , generally speaking @xmath242 is only a moishezon space @xcite , non projective , and on moishezon spaces we may have nontrivial positive currents which are @xmath191-exact ; but usually ( in the examples we know ) these currents do not arise from powers of a khler form . note that the current @xmath243 is a strictly positive measure , hence it can not be @xmath191-exact . also , it is easy to see that @xmath244 can not be @xmath191-exact , otherwise @xmath61 would be cohomologous to a divisor with support in @xmath53 , an evident absurdity",
    ". however , the non-@xmath191-exactness of the intermediate powers @xmath245 , @xmath246 , seems less evident .",
