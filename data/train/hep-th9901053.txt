    "this talk is based on ref .",
    "@xcite , but it also includes some new results and , we hope , a better understanding of the results already contained in the original paper .",
    "this work has its origin in an old puzzle that dates back to 1993 and in some recent development .",
    "the puzzle consists in the following : while studying the functional integral approach to quantization of ym2 on a torus ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) some of us noticed that in order to get the correct result for the partition function on the torus in the gauge where the field strength @xmath3 is diagonal ( unitary gauge ) we would have been obliged to neglect some contributions from twisted sectors that seem to arise naturally in that gauge .",
    "the problem was put aside and ascribed to some lack of understanding from us .",
    "recently however the same type of contributions were considered in the matrix string theory model of ref .",
    "@xcite where they give origin to string configurations of different lengths . to be more specific",
    "let us consider the matrix string theory action : @xmath4 ^ 2 + { 1\\over g_s } \\theta^t\\gamma_m [ x^m,\\theta]\\right)\\ ] ] where the fields @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) are @xmath7 hermitian matrices , as are the 8 fermionic fields @xmath8 and @xmath9 . the two dimensional world sheet is an infinite cylinder parametrized by coordinates @xmath10 , with @xmath11 between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this action can be obtained from the ten dimensional super yang - mills theory by dimensional reduction and it features the same set of fields as green - schwarz action for type ii superstring , except that here the fields are matrices . in the limit where the string coupling constant",
    "@xmath14 goes to zero the fields @xmath15 and @xmath16 will commute and can be simultaneously diagonalized . the eigenvalues @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) of @xmath5 can be identified with string coordinates which describe the world sheets of a gas of @xmath19 green - schwarz light - cone strings .",
    "the key point is that the eigenvalues @xmath17 can be interchanged as one goes around the compact dimension @xmath11 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an element of @xmath22 . in conclusion the fields @xmath23 take value on the orbifold space @xmath24 , with strings of different lengths associated to the cycles of @xmath21 , and the corresponding hilbert space consists of twisted sectors in correspondence with the conjugacy classes of @xmath22 .",
    "the same twisted sectors appear naturally in ym2 in the unitary gauge , where the field strength @xmath3 is diagonal .",
    "consider the partition function of ym2 in the first order formalism on a general riemann surface @xmath25 of genus @xmath26 : @xmath27[df]\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{t}{2}\\tr \\int_{\\sigma_g } d\\mu\\ , f^2 + \\ii\\ , \\tr \\int_{\\sigma_g } f(a ) f \\right\\}~ , \\label{partriemann}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the volume form on @xmath25 and @xmath29 .",
    "it is always possible , at least locally , to find a gauge transformation @xmath26 that diagonalizes @xmath3 : @xmath30 however @xmath26 is not unique : if @xmath26 diagonalizes @xmath3 , so does any gauge transformation of the form @xmath31 , with @xmath32 : in general , there are @xmath33 gribov copies of the gauge  fixed field strength @xmath3 . as in the case of matrix string theory ,",
    "the twisted sectors appear because as we go around a homotopically non trivial loop on @xmath25 , the eigenvalues can be interchanged , namely we can go from one gribov copy to another .",
    "consider now the case where @xmath25 is a torus parametrized by coordinates @xmath10 both ranging from @xmath12 and @xmath34 .",
    "the twisted sectors are labelled by the pair of permutations @xmath21 and @xmath35 associated to the two homotopically non trivial loops , more precisely by the boundary conditions @xmath36 where consistency requires @xmath21 and @xmath35 to commute : @xmath37 .    pairs of commuting permutations also define @xmath19-coverings of the torus without branch points , the @xmath19 sheets of the covering at each point of the target space being labelled by one eigenvalue of @xmath3 .",
    "this argument is easily generalized to higher genus riemann surfaces , and one can say in conclusion that twisted sectors are in correspondence with the inequivalent @xmath19-coverings of @xmath25 in absence of branch points",
    ". however if the genus is greater than one the quantization in the unitary gauge leads to divergences whose regularization , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , would amount to set to zero all twisted sectors .",
    "the argument is as follows : the brst invariant action in the unitary gauge consists of two terms , the first , denoted by @xmath38 , depends only on the diagonal components of the gauge fields and is just the gauge action in the first order formalism for the residual @xmath39 gauge invariance : @xmath40~,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the @xmath42-th diagonal term of the matrix form @xmath43 .",
    "the second term , named @xmath44 , contains the ghost and anti - ghost fields and the non  diagonal components of @xmath43 : @xmath45~ , \\label{offdiag}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 and @xmath47 denotes the inverse of the two dimensional vierbein .",
    "@xmath44 has a fermionic symmetry , which exchanges gauge and ghost fields ; hence one would expect the contributions to the partition functions from the ghost fields and the non  diagonal part of the gauge fields to cancel exactly .    however , this `` supersymmetry '' _ is _ in general broken by an anomaly in the functional measure , due to the fact that on a curved surface the number of degrees of freedom of a one - form ( like @xmath48 ) and of two zero forms ( like @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) do not match exactly . in fact the corresponding functional integral has been calculated exactly in @xcite and it is given by : @xmath51[d\\bar{c}^{ij}][da_{\\mu}^{ij } ] e^{-s_{\\rm off - diag } } = \\exp \\left[{1 \\over 8 \\pi } \\int_{\\sigma_g } r \\sum_{i > j } \\log ( \\lambda_i - \\lambda_j ) \\right]~ , \\label{anomaly}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the curvature scalar : only on flat riemann surfaces like the torus or the cylinder the symmetry is preserved at the quantum level .    following @xcite one finds , by gauge fixing the residual u@xmath53 invariance , that in the end only configurations where the eigenvalues @xmath54 are constant and equal to integers @xmath55 contribute .",
    "so the r.h.s . of ( [ anomaly ] )",
    "gives the standard dependence of ym2 partition function from the genus , while the dependence from @xmath56 is given by the u@xmath53 action @xmath38 thus reproducing the well known partition function of ym2 on a riemann surface @xcite : @xmath57 however in the present derivation nothing forbids @xmath58 for @xmath59 , and such terms , that we shall name non - regular terms following @xcite , are divergent for @xmath60 . notice that non - regular terms always appear in the twisted sectors , where at least two sheets of the @xmath19-covering are connected by going round some non contractible loop .",
    "therefore the corresponding eigenvalues are given by the same integer .",
    "the regularization proposed in @xcite is done by adding mass terms to the non diagonal part of the gauge fields ; in this way the non - regular terms vanish due to the ghost contribution which is proportional to @xmath61 , while the contribution from the gauge fields is now finite and proportional to @xmath62 .",
    "the limit @xmath63 is performed at the end .",
    "this regularization scheme , while preserving the u@xmath53 gauge symmetry , violates the original brst invariance as well as the fermionic symmetry between gauge fields and ghosts discussed above .",
    "a fully consistent treatment of the non - regular terms in the unitary gauge for @xmath60 is indeed lacking , and in our opinion this is a problem worth looking into in the future .",
    "the case @xmath64 is special : non regular terms are finite , the fermionic symmetry is anomaly free and hence there is no need of regularization .",
    "therefore we shall write the partition function as a sum over all sectors labelled by commuting pairs of permutations @xmath65 , thus including non regular terms",
    ". we will find that the result does not coincide with the standard partition function @xcite , which can be reproduced only by limiting the sum to the subset of sectors of the type @xmath66 .",
    "this choice however is not invariant under modular transformations on the torus .",
    "the twisted sectors can also be labelled , as discussed earlier on , by the @xmath19-fold covers without branch points of the torus . in order to sum over all sectors",
    "it is convenient on one hand to work in the grand canonical formalism , in which @xmath19 is not fixed , and introduce the grand - canonical partition function @xmath67 and the corresponding free energy @xmath68 : @xmath69 on the other hand it is convenient to work directly on the free energy @xmath68 , that receives contributions only from the connected coverings .",
    "the computation of the free energy entails two aspects : an `` entropic '' one , i.e. the counting of the inequivalent connected coverings , and the determination of the boltzmann factor that the functional integral ( [ partriemann ] ) implies for each covering .",
    "the counting of @xmath19-coverings of the torus without branch points , namely of the @xmath19-fold maps of a world sheet torus into the target torus , has already been discussed in the literature ( see for instance @xcite ) and its free energy is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 means that the sum is extended over the divisors @xmath72 of @xmath19 .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( [ torino1 ] ) , namely @xmath74 , enumerates the _ connected _ @xmath19-coverings of the torus .",
    "this result can be derived as follows : let the periods of the target space torus be @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the most general connected @xmath19-covering is then a torus of area @xmath77 whose periods are given by @xmath78 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "an example with @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 is given in figure 1 .",
    "there are @xmath84 choices of the integers @xmath85,@xmath72 and @xmath86 that satisfy these conditions , but one has to divide by the symmetry factor @xmath19 to account for the fact that coverings corresponding to different labelings of the sheets ( i.e. of the eigenvalues ) have to be identified .",
    "notice that the world sheet torus has a modular parameter @xmath87 and that summing over these tori with the weight @xmath88 is the discrete version of integrating over the modular parameter @xmath89 with the usual modular - invariant measure .",
    "in fact from @xmath90 and @xmath19 fixed we have @xmath91 .",
    "it is easy to see that in terms of the field @xmath92 , the partition function ( [ scartan ] ) becomes the partition function of a u@xmath93 theory on the world sheet torus .",
    "this partition function depends only on the area ; it is well - known to be @xmath94 @xmath95 .",
    "this is the boltzmann weight to be associated to the connected coverings of degree @xmath19 .",
    "we are now in the position of writing down the free energy , and thus automatically the grand - canonical partition function : @xmath96    we have allowed in front of the free energy @xmath68 a sign ambiguity , which corresponds to different choices of the a priori undetermined weights with which the contributions from the different twisted sectors are added .",
    "it is clear from ( [ torino2 ] ) that the plus sign leads to partition function @xmath97 of `` bosonic '' type ( a `` state '' with fixed @xmath85 and @xmath98 may appear any number of times ) , while @xmath99 is `` fermionic '' ( the exclusion principle holds ) .",
    "if we consider only the contribution of a subset of connected coverings , namely those with @xmath100 , @xmath101 , that are associated to permutations of the type @xmath66 , we obtain the following partition function : @xmath102 these expressions are known in the literature .",
    "@xmath103 is the grand - canonical expression that encodes , as shown in @xcite , the standard partition function for the u@xmath104 theory on the torus in the power series expansion of @xmath103 coincides , up to a sign and an overall normalization factor , with the standard partition function of u@xmath104 only for odd values of @xmath19 . for even values of @xmath19",
    "the integers @xmath55 are replaced by half - integers in the standard ym partition function .",
    "this half - integer shift however can be re - absorbed by adding to the action a term proportional to @xmath105 ( which is entirely in the u@xmath93 factor of u@xmath104 ) .",
    "the expansion of @xmath103 for even @xmath19 gives such modified theory .",
    "notice that in the case of su@xmath104 the problem does not arise and the sum over the @xmath66 sectors correctly reproduces the standard result for all values of @xmath19 . ]",
    "@xmath106 reproduces the partition function obtained in @xcite by quantizing on the algebra rather than on the group . by comparing eq.s ( [ torino2 ] ) and ( [ torino3 ] )",
    "we find @xmath107 an expansion in powers of @xmath108 of both sides of eq .",
    "[ torino4 ] leads for the fermionic case to the following relation : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the u@xmath104 partition function including all sectors and @xmath111 is the standard u@xmath112 partition function ( see however the discussion in the footnote ) . as an example we give the partition function for the case @xmath113 : @xmath114 the extra terms at the r.h.s .",
    "of ( [ enne3 ] ) are related to the states with @xmath115 and are not present in the conventional approach .",
    "one of the new features of our approach is that the ensemble of twisted sectors that contribute to the partition function is invariant under modular transformation on the cylinder , while the subset that reproduces the conventional result is not .",
    "in fact for instance a dehn twist maps the sector labelled by @xmath116 into one labelled by @xmath117 . as a result",
    "the conventional formulation is not modular invariant .",
    "this does not show in the partition function , which depends only on the area , but it should appear at the level of correlation function .",
    "for instance correlation functions of wilson loops that are mapped into each other by modular transformations on the torus ( like the two sets depicted in figure 2 ) should coincide in our approach but not in the conventional formulation .",
    "work is in progress to verify this point .",
    "the partition function on a torus is often calculated by first considering a cylinder with fixed holonomies at the edges and then by sewing the two ends together .",
    "this involves identifying the two end holonomies up to a gauge transformation , namely identifying their eigenvalues up to a permutation @xmath21 .",
    "hence a sum over @xmath21 appears in the final result .",
    "it is clear that in this way only the @xmath66 sectors are taken into account , and in order to consider also sectors corresponding to non trivial commuting pairs @xmath65 , with @xmath35 associated to the compact dimension of the cylinder , one has somehow to generalize the possible boundary conditions at the edges of the cylinder which in the conventional approach are just the u@xmath104 holonomies . in order to do that",
    "let us choose the unitary gauge on the cylinder as in eq .",
    "( [ pgaugefix ] ) , and consider a non trivial sector labelled by a permutation @xmath35 that defines , according to the second of eq.s ( [ bcon ] ) , the boundary conditions for the eigenvalues @xmath118 as we go round the compact dimension parametrized by the coordinate @xmath119 .",
    "we refer to the original paper @xcite for the details of the calculation and give here only the main result .",
    "this can be summarized by saying that for non trivial @xmath35 there are as many independent invariant angles in the holonomies as the number of cycles in @xmath35 .",
    "more precisely , supposing that @xmath35 has @xmath120 cycles of order @xmath85 the invariant angles @xmath121 of a wilson loop winding round the compact dimension have the following structure : @xmath122 where we have made the replacement @xmath123 with @xmath124 and @xmath125 to denote that @xmath42 is the @xmath98-th element of the @xmath126-th cycle of order @xmath85 .",
    "the independent invariant angles are just the @xmath127 , and are associated to the cycles , the other eigenvalues within each cycle being spaced like the @xmath85-th roots of 1 .",
    "when sewing the cylinder the invariant angles are identified up to a permutation @xmath21 that preserves the cycle structure , namely @xmath128 where @xmath129 is a permutations of the @xmath120 cycles of order @xmath85 and @xmath130 is an integer shift @xmath131 .",
    "( [ ncyl2 ] ) is equivalent to the statement that @xmath21 commutes with @xmath35 , and hence it reproduces the by now familiar pattern of the twisted sectors . from the previous discussion it is clear that the end states on the cylinder are not parametrized by the u@xmath104 holonomies but rather by the holonomies of @xmath132 .",
    "it is also clear that by considering just the u@xmath104 holonomies one is automatically projecting on the trivial sector @xmath133 .",
    "although this projection appears the most natural thing to do in the framework of gauge theories , and it is so far also the only approach that we know how to implement on a lattice , it introduces an asymmetry between the two generators of the torus and ultimately breaks the modular invariance in the sense mentioned above .",
    "the grand canonical partition function @xmath134 given in eq .",
    "( [ torino2 ] ) describes in the large @xmath56 limit the coverings of the torus .",
    "in fact in that limit the boltzmann factor given by the partition function of the u@xmath93 gauge theory tends to @xmath135 and we are left with the partition function that simply counts the homotopically distinct coverings of the @xmath64 target space by a @xmath136 world - sheet : @xmath137 . so in this limit",
    "the twisted sectors define a string theory , exactly in the same way as they do in matrix string theory",
    ". it can also be argued , and in the fermionic case it is obvious from the exclusion principle , that in this limit large values of @xmath85 , namely long strings , are relevant .",
    "quite the opposite happens in the limit @xmath138 , in fact one can see from the poisson re - summation formula that in this limit the boltzmann weight behaves like @xmath139 , and so the leading contributions to the partition function come from coverings that maximize the number of disconnected world sheets .",
    "so only states with @xmath100 survive in the @xmath140 limit , and the theory reduces to the conventional one without twisted sectors .",
    "it is possible , but yet not proved , that a phase transition separates the two phases dominated respectively by long and short strings .",
    "the small @xmath56 region is also the relevant one for the large @xmath19 limit of ym2 studied by gross and taylor in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "in fact the limit is done , following the original idea of t hooft , by taking @xmath141 and keeping @xmath142 fixed .",
    "gross and taylor proved that the partition function of @xmath143 yang - mills theory on a two dimensional riemann surface @xmath144 of genus @xmath26 counts the homotopically distinct maps from a world - sheet @xmath145 of genus @xmath146 to @xmath144 .",
    "in particular if the target space is a torus and one considers only the leading term in the large @xmath19 expansion , which means considering only world sheets of genus @xmath135 , one finds the partition function @xmath147 this is the same string partition function that is found from the twisted sectors in the large @xmath56 limit , with @xmath108 replaced by @xmath148 .",
    "this coincidence is suggestive of some kind of underlying duality in the theory .",
    "however for this duality to exists beyond the rather trivial case of @xmath149 maps we should be able to extend the twisted sectors introduced in @xcite to include coverings with branch points , which correspond to higher genus world sheets , namely to the possibility for strings to split and join . these would be dual to the sub - leading terms in the @xmath150 expansion of @xcite .",
    "however branch points correspond to points where the curvature of the world sheet becomes a delta function , leading through eq .",
    "( [ anomaly ] ) to terms coupling different sheets of the coverings .",
    "the problem here is of the same nature as the one that is encountered if one quantizes ym2 in the unitary gauge on a surface with @xmath60 , namely the appearance of logarithmic interactions between different eigenvalues , that eventually lead to divergences",
    ". a better understanding of this point is then crucial also for a consistent formulation of ym2 as a matrix string theory on a torus , so it is not yet clear to us if such formulation exists also at the level of string interactions , or weather this can be done only by embedding ym2 in the more general framework of the matrix string theory given by ( [ sym ] ) , where it is known that string interactions can be consistently introduced @xcite . in both cases",
    "the analysis developed in @xcite is relevant .",
    "in fact gauge degrees of freedom are crucial in matrix string theory for the description of string interactions as well as for the relation of non - trivial fluxes with d - brane charges @xcite . shortly after our paper appeared on the hep - th archive , kostov and vanhove @xcite calculated the partition function of the matrix string theory of eq .",
    "( [ sym ] ) .",
    "they took advantage of the fact that the contributions to the partition function of the `` matter fields '' @xmath5 and @xmath16 cancel due to supersymmetry , so that in the end the only contributions come from the different topological sectors of ym2 .",
    "in fact their result coincides with ours , except that they obtain our free energy rather than the partition function because the structure of the fermionic zero - modes in the matter sector effectively kills the contributions from disconnected world sheets .",
    "in @xcite the dimensional reduction of this free - energy to zero dimensions is shown to correctly reproduce the partition function for the ikkt model @xcite , namely @xmath151 .",
    "the latter @xcite is related to the moduli space of d - instantons or , by t - duality , to the counting of bound states of d0-branes .",
