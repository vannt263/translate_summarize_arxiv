    "since the discovery of giant arcs towards galaxy clusters abell 370 and cl 2244 - 02 ( lynds & petrosian 1996 , soucail _ et al . _ 1987 ) , the search for bright arcs towards galaxy clusters has steadily grown .",
    "these detections , now amounting to over 25 clusters with at least one lensed arc , have allowed the construction of galaxy cluster gravitational potentials responsible for lensing and the study of high redshift galaxies which are magnified through cluster gravitational telescopes. we refer the reader to narayan & bartelmann ( 1996 ) for an overview of gravitational lensing in general , and fort & mellier ( 1994 ) for a review of gravitational lensing towards galaxy clusters .    currently , all of the known arcs and arclets in galaxy clusters are optically selected .",
    "this is contrary to the radio selected lenses which amount to more than half the known gravitational lenses primarily due to galaxy - scale gravitational potentials .",
    "although radio searches have been carried out with the hope of detecting what may possibly be called radio arcs in galaxy clusters , no convincing evidence has yet been found for such sources .",
    "statistical studies of lensed radio emission towards galaxy clusters have been controversial , with some studies suggesting the detection of preferential tangential orientation , as in due to a weak lensing effect ( bagchi & kapahi 1995 ) , while others suggesting no such evidence ( e.g. , andernach _ et al .",
    ".    the gravitational lensing of radio sources towards galaxy clusters can directly or indirectly affect important cosmological studies based on galaxy clusters , such as observations of the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 , 1980 ; see birkinshaw 1998 for a recent review ) .",
    "loeb & refregier ( 1997 ) suggested that lensed sources towards clusters can produce an underestimation of the hubble constant as much as 13% when derived by combining the sz observations at 15 ghz and x - ray emission observations .",
    "this is primarily due the fact that when accounting for radio sources in sz observations , there is more unaccounted radio flux towards the cluster center region than outside regions , due to enhanced lensing contribution towards center . in cooray _",
    "( 1998 ) we addressed the issue of gravitationally lensed radio sources in clusters at 28.5 ghz based on radio sources detected as part of the sz observational program using mm - arrays by carlstrom _",
    "( 1995 ) . in order to properly address the issue of radio contamination of sz observations and to find direct evidence for lensed radio sources towards galaxy clusters ,",
    "we have initiated a study of x - ray luminous clusters at radio wavelengths . as part of this study",
    ", we searched for radio emission from lensed gravitational arcs in present radio data .",
    "lensed emission from gravitational arcs and images has been target of various studies related to detection of molecular line emission at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "most of the co lines in emission have been detected in gravitationally lensed sources ( e.g. , barvainis _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , and casoli _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) reported the detection of co(2 - 1 ) line associated with the bright a0 arc towards abell 370 at a redshift of 0.725 ( soucail _ et al .",
    "we restricted our search towards clusters where accurate astrometric information is available for optical arcs . in order to perform an unbiased radio search , we considered the two large area radio surveys , mainly nvss ( condon _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) and first ( becker _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) , using the vla at 1.4 ghz .",
    "we opted to use the data from the vla b - array first survey , due to the higher angular resolution and higher sensitivity of the data when compared to the vla d - array nvss survey .",
    "we present initial results from this search , which included a radio search towards galaxy clusters abell 370 , abel 963 and cl 2244 - 02 . in section 2 of the paper we present our results and in section 3 we discuss one strong detection of radio emission associated with the bright arc in abell 370 .",
    "we also discuss the possible sources of radio emission towards the arc and show that the emission is more likely due to lensing and is associated with the lensed galaxy instead of a foreground source .",
    "we searched the literature to find published astrometric locations of strong arcs towards galaxy clusters which also overlap with the sky coverage of first data available as of early this year .",
    "even though there are over 20 clusters with lensed arcs , we failed to find astrometric information for over 40% of them in published papers and for over 15% of the clusters we found that the accuracy of published coordinates was less than what was required for the present radio counterpart search . also , the limited area of the sky for which calibrated first survey data was available restricted our search to 3 clusters : abell 370 , abell 963 , and cl 2244 - 02 .",
    "we refer the reader to becker _",
    "( 1995 ) for details on first survey , including observational and data reduction techniques .    in table 1",
    ", we provide observational parameters of the arcs studied as part of this search , including astrometric and redshift information for them and the clusters towards which they are detected .",
    "we searched the regions near these arcs in the final calibrated first survey image data .",
    "we expect that the uniform reduction and calibration of raw data will not bias our search from one cluster field to another . in table 2",
    ", we list the observed 1.4 ghz flux density , both peak and integrated flux densities , and rms noise .",
    "as tabulated , we have clearly detected the 1.4 ghz emission towards the lensed arc a0 in abell 370 .",
    "the peaked emission is @xmath0 1.9@xmath1 away from the tabulated optical position of the arc from smail _ et al . _",
    "this offset is roughly equivalent to 1 pixel ( 1.8@xmath1 ) in the first image used for the analysis , and could be improved with better optical astrometric information .",
    "however , given that the optical arc is extended over 20@xmath1 , this small offset does not by itself rule out that the emission is associated with the lensed arc .",
    "also , up to 1.5@xmath1 offset is expected between the radio and optical astrometric frames , which needs to be improved by combining preferably astrometric information of stellar objects which are bright in radio .    in fig . 1",
    ", we show the region associated with the gravitational lensed arcs towards abell 370 .",
    "the circularly marked regions are the expected central locations of two arcs , and as shown , bright emission is detected towards the northern arc a0 with an integrated flux density of 1.48 mjy and rms noise level of 0.16 mjy beam@xmath2 .",
    "the peaked emission coincides with the lensed optical arc within 1.9 arcseconds .",
    "the bright emission can be fitted with an elliptical gaussian model of 7.4@xmath1 by 6.8@xmath1 and a positional angle of 91 degrees . according to the first catalog , the observed",
    "emission is best fitted with an ellipse of 4.9@xmath1 by 1.7@xmath1 and a positional angle of 90 degrees based on the deconvoluted elliptical point - spread function .",
    "the surrounding region of this peaked source shows a substantial increase in diffuse emission , especially to the east .",
    "however , this diffuse emission is not clearly imaged with the existing b - array data .",
    "the region surrounding lensed arc a5 does not show any evidence for 1.4 ghz radio emission at the present sensitivity level , with an upper limit on 1.4 ghz integrated flux density of 0.55 mjy and rms 0.17 my beam@xmath2 .    in fig .",
    "2 , we show the 1.5@xmath3 by 1.5@xmath3 region centered on the bright arc towards galaxy cluster cl2244 - 02 . here again , we do not find evidence of radio emission .",
    "the bright radio source to the west is txs2233 - 022 ( douglas _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) with a peak flux density of 10.6 mjy at 1.4 ghz .",
    "the upper limit on the lensed arc region is 0.66 mjy with a rms noise of 0.18 mjy beam@xmath2 .",
    "also , we did not find any evidence for radio emission associated with the bright northern arc towards abell 963 , with an upper limit on the integrated flux density of 0.45 mjy with a rms noise of 0.20 mjy beam@xmath2 .",
    "the observed data clearly suggest 1.4 ghz radio emission towards the the gravitationally lensed arc a0 in abell 370 .",
    "we looked for literature and databases to find radio emission around this region at other centimeter wavelengths , but failed to find any .",
    "the upper limit on the 28.5 ghz radio emission around this region is 0.32 mjy with a rms noise of 0.12 mjy beam@xmath2 ( cooray _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , but the large synthesized beam of these observations , targeted at imaging the sz effect , do not allow the flux density to be estimated accurately . also , out of the three clusters studied in this paper , abell 370 is the only cluster in the cooray _",
    "( 1998 ) sample of clusters selected for sz observations at ovro and bima arrays outfitted with cm - wave receivers .",
    "the observed 1.4 ghz emission is clearly peaked , instead of an arc - like emission as one would expect , if the radio emission is lensed and follows optical emission . however ,",
    "if the radio emission is due to a smaller region of the lensed galaxy , such as a nuclear region , than the optical emission , then this peak can easily be explained even with gravitational lensing .",
    "this situation is also similar to some examples of known gravitational lenses where optical and infrared observations show the existence of a ring , while radio data only shows partial peaked emission at different locations of the ring ( e.g. , king _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) .",
    "the arc a0 in abell 370 extends 20@xmath1 with an estimated width of @xmath0 1.5@xmath1 ( see fig . 1 in kneib _",
    "1994 ) . the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of this arc between 2000 and 16000 @xmath4",
    "is well fitted by a normal spiral galaxy of class sbc ( aragon - salamanca & ellis 1990 ) , where as the seds of higher redshift a5 arc and the arc in cl2244 - 02 suggest the existence of young stars , closely matching the sed of an intense star forming system ( smail _ et al .",
    "the non detected arcs are either at high redshift ( 2.237 for cl 2244 - 02 ) or have a less surface brightness when compared with the bright arc in abell 370 .",
    "the magnification factor for arc a0 as derived by detailed lens modeling by kneib _",
    "( 1992 ) is 14 . as estimated by casoli _",
    "( 1996 ) , the arc corresponds to an unlensed galaxy of size 3@xmath5 . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the radio emission is clearly unresolved in the existing b - array data .",
    "further observations with a - array should allow better mapping of the emission , and is requird to test the lensing hypothesis presented here .",
    "it is likely that the radio emission is associated with the nuclear region of the lensed galaxy .",
    "however , an estimate of the spectral index for radio emission can aid in the identification of emission region , or at least constraining certain radio emission mechanisms .",
    "the limit of radio emission at 28.5 ghz do not allow an accurate measurement of the spectral index , and observations perhaps at 4.85 ghz using the vla a - array are much needed .",
    "if a steep - spectrum is found , then this emission may be associated with an agn - related emission .",
    "however , given that the arc is a lensed spiral galaxy , strong agn activity is not expected . the radio emission can also be due to star formation , either ongoing or recent cessation of star formation , but smail _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) finds that this arc at a redshift of 0.725 does nt show enough evidence to suggest intense star formation .",
    "however , the radio emission can be directly due to supernova remnants , as suggested by helou _ et al . _ ( 1985 ) , and the flux density is in agreement with their estimates of supernova rates in spiral galaxies .    apart from lensing hypothesis for radio emission",
    ", there is also an alternative and obvious explanation to radio emission , which is foreground emission imposed on the region of lensed optical arc .",
    "we can estimate the probability for positional coincidence based on the observed number of optical galaxies and radio sources in the field of abell 370 . in a first image of 10@xmath3 by 10@xmath3 centered on the abell 370 cluster center",
    ", we find 14 radio sources with peak flux density greater than 1 mjy . in the 1@xmath3 by 1@xmath3 region centered on the lensed arc",
    ", we find close to 25 optical sources with v magnitude greater than 22 .",
    "assuming that the radio emission center extends over a region of 5@xmath1 by 5@xmath1 and allowing a 1.5@xmath1 error for any difference between optical and radio astrometric frames , the probability that the radio emission is due to a source other than arc is close to 10@xmath6 .",
    "it is more likely that radio emission is associated with the lensed arc rather than a foreground galaxy .",
    "however , if optical sources down to 25th magnitude is considered this probability increases substantially , but with the observed increase in diffuse brightness surrounding the optical arc , it is not possible to rule out gravitational lensing immediately .",
    "a reason for diffuse emission is required and it may well be associated with gravitational lensing .",
    "an alternative explanation is that this emission is realted to a cluster wide diffused halo type source , such as the ones observed towards coma ( e.g. , feretti & giovannini 1998 ) .",
    "however , such halo sources are expected to brighten near the central region of the cluster instead of 30@xmath1 to 40@xmath1 away form center where arcs are observed at the distance of typical einstein radii .",
    "therefore , reasons for diffuse emission as associated with cluster electrons can only be understood only if a possible galaxy cluster merger and subcluster at the location of the bright arc is introduced .",
    "simple interpretation of the diffuse emission as due to gravitational lensing needs to be further investigated and sensitive observations perhaps will enable the modeling of such emission based on gravitational lensing .",
    "such an analysis has been performed to explain the low brightness surface emission observed in the field containing gravitational lens 0957 + 561 by avruch _",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "it is expected that more radio observational work will be carried out near this arc region to map both the radio emission towards the arc and the diffuse emission surrounding it at a resolution better than what is currently available .",
    "also , in the optical side more astrometric work is required to obtain enough positional accuracy to do a better radio counterpart search of lensed arcs than that it performed here with current information . until then , we can not rule out the possibility that the observed radio emission is associated with the lensed galaxy .",
    "if lensing interpretation is true , then the arc a0 in abell 370 is the first arc to show radio emission of a lensed arc towards a galaxy cluster .",
