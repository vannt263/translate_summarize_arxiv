    "our purpose in this paper is to study list coloring of directed graphs .",

    "@xmath0 of @xmath1 is the smallest integer @xmath2 such that @xmath15 can be partitioned into @xmath2 sets @xmath16 where each @xmath17 is acyclic .",

    "it is easy to see that for any undirected graph @xmath4 and its bidirected digraph @xmath1 obtained from @xmath4 by replacing each edge by two oppositely oriented arcs , we have @xmath18 .",
    "the dichromatic number was first introduced by neumann - lara  @xcite in 1982 .",

    "@xcite and harutyunyan and mohar ( see notably  @xcite ) demonstrated that this digraph invariant generalizes many results on the graph chromatic number .",

    "we note that the definition of list coloring of digraphs is not quite new as it first appeared in @xcite where the authors derived an analog of gallai s theorem for digraphs , as well as in @xcite .",
    "our goal in this paper is to initiate the study of the list dichromatic number . in particular , we point out that the relationship between the dichromatic number and list dichromatic number is surprisingly similar to the relationship between the graph chromatic number and the list chromatic number .",
    "this is mainly done by extending known results involving the chromatic number and list chromatic number to directed graphs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start , in section  [ section : ohba ] , by showing that the equality @xmath20 holds for small digraphs , by proving a directed version of ohba s conjecture .",
    "we then consider bipartite digraphs in section  [ section : bipartite ] , and in particular show that while @xmath21 holds for these digraphs , their value of @xmath22 can be as large as @xmath3 , obtaining a natural digraph analogue of a known result in @xcite . in sections  [ section : tournaments ] and",
    "[ section : random ] , we consider tournaments and random digraphs , respectively , and show that their parameters @xmath23 and @xmath22 behave in a similar way .",
    "we then provide , in section  [ section : upper ] , a brooks - like upper bound on @xmath22 for digon - free digraphs , extending an analogous bound on the dichromatic number in @xcite .",
    "we finally end this paper by addressing an intriguing question in concluding section  [ section : ccl ] .",
    "most of the tools and arguments employed in our proofs are probabilistic ; for more details , we refer the reader to the book of molloy and reed  @xcite .",
    "in  @xcite , ohba conjectured that the equality @xmath24 should hold for every undirected graph with relatively small order ( compared to their chromatic number ) .",
    "ohba s conjecture was recently proved in @xcite by noel , reed and wu .",
    "[ c:2:2 ] for every graph @xmath4 with @xmath25 , we have @xmath26 .",
    "one could naturally wonder whether the directed analog of ohba s conjecture holds in our context .",
    "we prove this to be true in the following result .",

    "set @xmath29 , and consider a partition @xmath16 of @xmath15 such that each @xmath17 is acyclic . now consider the following undirected graph @xmath30 obtained from @xmath1 :    * @xmath31 , * @xmath32 iff @xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath35 .    note that @xmath30 is a complete @xmath2-partite graph with vertex partition @xmath16 .",

    "furthermore , it is easy to see that @xmath30 satisfies the condition stated in theorem [ c:2:2 ] , since : @xmath37 hence , @xmath38 since theorem  [ c:2:2 ] is verified  @xcite .",
    "now consider any @xmath2-list - assignment @xmath11 to @xmath1 .",

    "i.e. _ an assignment of colors to the vertices from their respective list so that there is no monochromatic edge connecting two parts @xmath17 and @xmath41 with @xmath35 . it should be now clear that @xmath40 is also an @xmath11-coloring of @xmath1 :    * since , for every edge @xmath42 with @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , we have @xmath43 , there can not be any monochromatic cycle including vertices from different @xmath17 s ; * since each @xmath17 is acyclic , there can not be any monochromatic cycle including vertices from a single @xmath17 .",
    "thus , @xmath44 .",
    "one of the classical results in the theory of list coloring of graphs is the result due to erds , rubin and taylor @xcite which asserts that there exist bipartite graphs @xmath4 with @xmath45 .",

    "<S> the dichromatic number @xmath0 of a digraph @xmath1 is the least number @xmath2 such that the vertex set of @xmath1 can be partitioned into @xmath2 parts each of which induces an acyclic subdigraph </S>",
    "<S> . introduced by neumann - lara in 1982 , this digraph invariant shares many properties with the usual chromatic number of graphs and can be seen as the natural analog of the graph chromatic number . in this paper , we study the list dichromatic number of digraphs , giving evidence that this notion generalizes the list chromatic number of graphs . </S>",
    "<S> we first prove that the list dichromatic number and the dichromatic number behave the same in many contexts , such as in small digraphs ( by proving a directed version of ohba s conjecture ) , tournaments , and random digraphs . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider bipartite digraphs , and show that their list dichromatic number can be as large as @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we finally give a brooks - type upper bound on the list dichromatic number of digon - free digraphs .    list coloring ; list dichromatic number ; dichromatic number ; digraphs .    </S>",
