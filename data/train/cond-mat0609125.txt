    "<S> we investigated the possibility of temperature dependent lattice distortions in the pyrochlore compound tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 by measuring the internal magnetic field distribution , using muon spin resonance , and comparing it to the susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements are done at temperatures as low as 70  mk and external fields up to 6  kg . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the evolution of the width of the field distribution can be explained by spin susceptibility only , thus ruling out a temperature dependent hyperfine coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that lattice deformations are absent in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .    despite its short - range afm correlations at temperatures lower than 100k </S>",
    "<S> , the tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 remains in a fluctuating paramagnetic spin - liquid state down to 70mk @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this very unusual state of matter has attracted considerable attention of experimentalist and theorist alike . </S>",
    "<S> recently it was demonstrated that , under pressure @xcite high magnetic field @xcite or both @xcite , tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 does order magnetically . the possibility that this order stems from magneto - elastic coupling was considered in all cases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this type of coupling allows the lattice to distort in order to relieve the magnetic frustration , concomitantly lowering the total system energy . </S>",
    "<S> thus the magneto - elastic coupling , which is a small perturbation to the spin hamiltonian , can select one ground state out of the macroscopically  degenerate ground states @xcite . in the most spectacular case the magneto - elastic coupling leads to long range spin order accompanied by a new lattice structure such as in zncr@xmath0o@xmath2 @xcite and cdcr@xmath3o@xmath4@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative and less dramatic possibility is a selection of a ground state with short range spin order and short range lattice deformation . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> the original lattice structure is preserved on the average . </S>",
    "<S> this might be the situation in y@xmath0mo@xmath0o@xmath1 where evidence for lattice deformations were found by several methods @xcite .    in this work we study the possible existence of magneto - elastic coupling in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 using the muon spin resonance ( @xmath5sr ) technique . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea is to investigate the nature of the changes in the local environment of the muon as the temperature decreases . </S>",
    "<S> we determine whether only the spin polarization is changing or whether the lattice is involved as well . </S>",
    "<S> electronic spin polarization contributes to the shift of the muon spin rotation frequency . </S>",
    "<S> lattice distortions are responsible for muon spin polarization relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> comparing these two quantities provides information on the presence or absence of magneto - elastic coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> transverse [ tf ] and longitudinal field [ lf ] @xmath5sr measurements were performed with powder samples on the gps and ltf spectrometers at paul scherrer institute , switzerland . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements were carried out with the muon spin tilted by @xmath6 relative to the direction of the applied magnetic fields , and positron data were accumulated in both the forward - backward ( longitudinal ) and the up - down ( transverse ) directions simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> this allowed us to determine both transverse and longitudinal muon spin relaxations rates . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ musraw ] we show the lf [ panel ( a ) ] and the tf [ panel ( b ) ] data at two temperatures and applied field of 2 kg . </S>",
    "<S> the tf data are shown in a reference frame rotating at a field of 1.5 kg . </S>",
    "<S> several aspects can be seen in the raw data : from the time scale it is clear that the transverse relaxation is by far greater than the longitudinal one . </S>",
    "<S> the longitudinal relaxation increases as the temperature decreases , as was observed previously @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the transverse relaxation increases and the muon rotation frequency decreases upon cooling .    [ ptb ]     and [ tffit ] . ]    the @xmath5sr lf polarization is best described by the root exponential @xmath7 where the parameter @xmath8 is set by taking into account the tilt of the muon spin relative to the longitudinal magnetic field , @xmath9 is the longitudinal relaxation time , @xmath10 is the background , and @xmath11 is time . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the tf polarization is best fitted by a root exponential superimposed on a cosine oscillation @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the transverse relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> the other parameters have the same mining as in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ lffit ] . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of the fits is presented by the solid lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ musraw ] .    </S>",
    "<S> data were collected in the temperature range 60  mk to 100  k and three fields of 2 , 4 , and 6  kg . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency @xmath14 as a function of temperature for the three different fields is depicted in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ shift ] . the frequency shift </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath15 is shown in the main panel for the same temperatures and fields . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath16 as the frequency of the free muon in the rotating reference frame . similarly , we present @xmath17 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ rlx2 ] , and in the inset @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the most important aspect of the data is that all quantities saturate as the temperature decreases below @xmath192k .    </S>",
    "<S> [ ptb ]    . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the shift and lf relaxation have a simple interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 is a result of the sample magnetization , and @xmath18 stems from dynamic field fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation @xmath17 is a bit more involved . </S>",
    "<S> it is a result of both static field inhomogeneities on the time scale of one muon spin turn , and dynamically fluctuating fields . </S>",
    "<S> however , since @xmath18 is an order of magnitude lower than @xmath17 , the contribution to the tf relaxation from dynamic fluctuations is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath17 could be analyzed in terms of fields inhomogeneities only .    </S>",
    "<S> [ ptb ]     as a function of temperature for three different fields . </S>",
    "<S> inset , the muon spin longitudinal relaxation rates @xmath18 at the same temperatures and fields . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath17 is related to lattice deformation via the muon coupling to its neighboring spins and the system s susceptibility . to demonstrate this relation </S>",
    "<S> let s assume for simplicity that the muon is coupled only to one electronic spin @xmath21 ( extension to multiple couplings is trivial ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field experienced by the muon is a sum of the external field @xmath22 and the field from the neighboring electron @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the spectroscopic splitting factor , and @xmath25 is the bohr magneton . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 is the coupling between the muon and electron spin , which we assume depends on the distance between them , although at present the origin of this coupling is unknown . in a mean field approximation , @xmath27 @xmath28 </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the muon experiences a magnetic field @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the susceptibility and the couplings are isotropic , the time evolution of a muon spin due to static field inhomogeneity is given by : @xmath30\\rho(\\delta a)d\\delta a \\label{rlx_theory}%\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the mean coupling , @xmath32 is the muon gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath33 is the distribution of coupling variations . from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tffit ] and [ rlx_theory ] we find , using inverse fourier transform that : ( i ) the frequency shift is given by @xmath34 ( ii ) the distribution @xmath33 can be expressed as @xmath35 where the effective width of the distribution , @xmath36 , is given by @xmath37    @xmath38   \\label{fx}%\\ ] ]    and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the fresnel functions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sigma ] , if the ratio between @xmath17 and @xmath20 remains constant as the temperature decreases , the most likely conclusion is that @xmath36 is temperature independent , and no lattice deformations are present . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion would be wrong only if by accident @xmath41 turns out to be temperature independent while @xmath42 does vary with @xmath43 . to eliminate this possibility @xmath44 </S>",
    "<S> must be measured directly as discussed below . </S>",
    "<S> it should be pointed out that the same calculation could be done by assuming that @xmath44 is distributed instead of @xmath45 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> a proportionality between @xmath46 and @xmath20 would mean a temperature independent distribution of @xmath44 throughout the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this would equally role out lattice distortion upon cooling .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ t2andk ] we show @xmath47 versus @xmath20 with the temperature as an implicit parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the two quantities are linearly dependent at all fields . allowing for a base line shift , which does not originate in localized spins will lead to a proportionality relation between these quantities . </S>",
    "<S> this stands in strong contrast to y@xmath48mo@xmath0o@xmath1 where the muon transverse relaxation grows as a function of @xmath44 faster than exponentially . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ t2andk ] using data from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite on a semi log scale . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 the muon transverse relaxation has the same temperature dependence as the shift . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , by calculating @xmath36 for each data point using eq . [ sigma ] </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath49 is 15% for tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and 115% for y@xmath0mo@xmath0o@xmath1 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the average and standard deviation of @xmath36 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath52 is a measure of the relative change in the distances variations due to temperature changes .     versus the shift in muon spin rotation frequency @xmath20 , which is proportional to the susceptibility @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the same type of measurement on a semi log scale in the pyrochlore compound y@xmath48mo@xmath0o@xmath1 taken from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we also performed dc - susceptibility measurements using a cryogenic squid magnetometer , and home built faraday balance @xcite in a dilution refrigerator ( dr ) . in the faraday balance </S>",
    "<S> the powder sample is attached to a metallic sample holder , which serves as one of the plates of a capacitor , and is suspended on a spring . the sample experience both a field @xmath53 and a field gradient of @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the capacitance @xmath55 is measured as a function of @xmath53 and @xmath56 .    in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ susc ] we show raw data of @xmath57 versus @xmath53 at 70mk and 2.6k . at all fields the slope at 70  mk is smaller than at 2.6  k. this means that at some temperature , in between these two , the susceptibility starts to decrease . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ susc ] we show the temperature dependent susceptibility by both experimental methods . </S>",
    "<S> the two measurements do not overlap in the 2 - 5 k region . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this problem to difficulties in cooling of the entire volume of the sample in the dr . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the mean temperature of the sample @xmath58 is higher than the dr temperature @xmath59 . nevertheless , as @xmath59 decreases , and so does @xmath58 , the susceptibility does not increase . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , below @xmath60 , the susceptibility decreases . a saturated susceptibility and the decrease below @xmath61  </S>",
    "<S> k is in rough agreement with previous measurements of luo _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result shows qualitatively that @xmath17 and @xmath44 do not vary substantially with @xmath43 below @xmath62  k , which supports our previous conclusions .    </S>",
    "<S> [ ptb ]     is observed as the temperature decreases . </S>",
    "<S> inset shows raw inverse capacitance versus applied field . </S>",
    "<S> the slope is proportional to @xmath44 . ]    to summarize , we compare the transverse relaxation rate resulting from internal field distribution to susceptibility measured by the shift in the muon rotation frequency and dc susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the relaxation rate has the same temperature dependence as the susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the only reason for increasing relaxation upon cooling is an increase in the electronic moment size . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there is no evidence for lattice deformation in tb@xmath48ti@xmath0o@xmath1 that is static on the time scale of 0.1 @xmath5sec .    </S>",
    "<S> we are grateful to the machine and instrument groups at paul scherrer institute , switzerland , whose outstanding efforts have made these experiments possible . </S>",
    "<S> the authors wish to acknowledge the financial support of nato through a collaborative linkage grant and the support from the european science foundation ( esf ) highly frustrated magnetism. </S>"
