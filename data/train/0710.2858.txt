    "several mathematical functions have been used for parametrizing the prompt @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "most commonly used is the empirical band function @xcite , which is not motivated by a physical model .",
    "there have been attempts to distinguish between spectral models analysing the low energy part of the spectrum .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and more recently @xcite searched for blackbody components in grb spectra with varying degrees of success .",
    "@xcite , using batse grb spectra , tested the synchrotron shock model and conclude that it  does not account for the observed spectra during the grb phase  .",
    "spectral studies above the peak energy are rare , one reason being the poor data quality because of lack of statistics . combining batse and egret spectra , @xcite report a high energy component for grb 941017 .",
    "they find a photon index of about 1.0 at energies above 5  .",
    "in this paper we report a high energy component in grb 021206 @xcite , observed with the reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager rhessi @xcite . having a peak energy of about 700  ,",

    ", the spectrum hardens again , and can be described with a photon index @xmath2 .",
    "this significant hardening around 4.5  can not be described with a band function .",
    "but it seems to differ from the spectral hardening in grb 941017 as well .",
    "there is one model that fits the entire rhessi spectrum of grb 021206 : the cannonball model @xcite .",
    "the cannonball model predicts a spectral hardening at several times the peak energy with a high energy photon index reaching @xmath3 .",
    "the question immediately arises whether the cannonball model can improve our description of other grb spectra .",
    "the difference between the band function and the cannonball model arises only at the high energy part of the spectrum , where data usually suffer from low statistics .",
    "therefore , we choose the strongest grbs registered by rhessi in the years 2002 to 2004 .",

    "it consists of two main parts : an imaging system and the spectrometer with nine germanium detectors @xcite .",
    "the satellite always points towards the sun and rotates about its axis at @xmath4rpm .",
    "the ge detectors are arranged in a plane perpendicular to this axis .",
    "the shape of the detectors is cylindrical with a height of @xmath5 cm and diameter of @xmath6 cm , and they are segmented into a thin front ( @xmath7 cm ) and a thick rear segment ( @xmath8 cm ) . since the shielding of the rear segments is minimal , photons with more than about 25  can enter from the side . above about 5080  , photons from any direction can be observed .",
    "each detected photon is time- and energy - tagged from 3  to 2.8  ( front segments ) or from 20  to 17  ( rear segments ) .",
    "the energy resolution is @xmath9  at 1  , and the time resolution is 1  @xmath10s .",
    "the effective area for grb detection depends on the incident photon energy @xmath11 and the angle between the grb direction and the rhessi axis , the incoming angle @xmath12 . over a wide range of @xmath11 and @xmath12 ,",
    "the effective area is around 150@xmath13@xmath14 .",
    "the sensitivity drops rapidly at energies below @xmath15  .      for this study ,",
    "we need well observed grb spectra .",
    "we chose grbs from the years 2002 to 2004 , because radiation damage starts to play a role in 2005 .",
    "the selected grbs have to be localized by other observations of the same grb ( rhessi can not measure the incoming angle ) , because @xmath12 enters into the simulation of the response function .",
    "a further requirement was the availability of good background data . and",
    "finally , the data storing mode ( ` rear decimation ' for onboard memory saving ) is not allowed to change during the entire grb and background time interval .",
    "of all the grbs meeting these criteria , we chose eight with the best signal - to - background ratio , listed in table  [ tab : grbs ] along with their incoming angle @xmath12 and the time intervals used .",
    "the lightcurves of these bursts are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ltc_grbsi ] and [ fig : ltc_grbsii ] .      the method of analysing rhessi grb spectra will be described in detail in a separate article ( e.  bellm , c.  wigger et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .    for each grb and detector segment , the total spectrum ( grb plus background ) during the burst was extracted , as well as the background spectra during two time intervals before and after the burst .",
    "the background was linearly ( sometimes quadratically ) interpolated and subtracted .",
    "the exact time intervals are listed in table [ tab : grbs ] .",
    "then we added all rear and all front segments , except for detector # 2 which is slightly damaged and has a bad energy resolution .",
    "since all grbs in this study are strong , the observational errors are dominated by the statistical error of the grb counts , not of the background .",
    "we simulate rhessi using geant3 @xcite .",
    "knowing the direction of the grb from other instruments , we simulate rhessi s response to photons coming from angle @xmath12 .",
    "the energy of the incoming photons is simulated as a power law spectrum ( i.e.  @xmath16 ) with typically @xmath17 .",
    "this power law simulation is only a rough approximation and is not not intended to represent the intrinsic grb spectrum , but instead provides simulated data representing rhessi s conversion of photons to counts .",
    "the true grb source spectrum is determined via weight factors for the resulting simulated count spectrum , as described below .",
    "the upper energy limit of the simulated photon spectrum is typically 30 mev , in the case of grb 021206 even 40 mev or 50 mev .",
    "this is important , because an incoming photon of e.g.  25 mev may well make a signal of 15 mev .",
    "rotation angles are generated uniformly , i.e.  we compute a rhessi - spin averaged response function .",
    "since the detector arrangement shows an approximate 120 degree symmetry , the averaging gives good results as long as the analysed time interval is at least one third of the rotation period ( @xmath18s ) .",
    "this was also confirmed by tests .",
    "the output of the simulation is an event list , or rather a hit list , consisting of all signals registered in the ge detectors . the simulated hit list , having @xmath19 entries indexed by the letter @xmath20 , contains the deposited energy ( @xmath21 ) as well as the initial photon energy ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the measured hit list contains only the observed energy .    for spectral fitting ,",
    "the observed energy histogram is compared with a histogram accumulated from the simulated hit list .",
    "more precisely : the measured histogram can be represented by a @xmath23-element vector @xmath24 with errors @xmath25 , and energy boundaries @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , ... , @xmath29 .",
    "we normalize the histogram @xmath24 to the total number of counts in the fit range : @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and the sum goes only over the bins included in the fit , i.e.   @xmath33 .",
    "the theoretical histogram @xmath34 is accumulated from the simulated hit list .",
    "each entry is weighted with a factor in order to scale from the simulated power law to the probability density which would be expected , had we actually simulated the grb source spectrum dn / de .",
    "the @xmath35th bin contains therefore the weighted sum of all simulated hits with @xmath21 belonging to that bin , i.e. : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 the first factor in eq .",
    "[ eq : weight ] accounts for the spectrum assumed in the simulation and the energy @xmath39 is an arbitrary normalisation .",
    "the second factor accounts for the spectrum of the incoming grb photons .",
    "possible parametrisations of @xmath40 are given below in  [ sec : models ] .",
    "if the grb spectrum had the same shape as the simulated one , i.e.  if @xmath41 , the weights would all be 1 .",
    "this method of using weight factors when filling a histogram is common in particle physics , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the statistical error of the theoretical histogram @xmath34 is @xmath42 (  6 of * ? ? ?",
    "as in the case of the measured histogram , the histogram @xmath34 is normalised : @xmath43 and @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "the parameters of the histogram @xmath34 are varied until the minimum of @xmath46 is found .",
    "the factor @xmath47 accounts for the normalisation between measured and simulated histogram .",
    "it is expected to be almost 1 , but should be treated as a free fit parameter . for each fit iteration ,",
    "the histogram @xmath34 is recalculated with different weights ( eq .  [ eq : weight ] ) .",
    "since the simulated hit list contains many more photons than the measured spectrum , we used the approximation @xmath48 while fitting .",
    "but it was always checked that the statistical error from the measurement is dominant .",
    "it is possible to create a response matrix from our simulations and perform spectral fits via forward - fitting , as in xspec . in any case ,",
    "our weighted histogram method gives equivalent fits to response matrices which are simulated directly ( by eb ; see e.  bellm , c.  wigger et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .      at low energies ,",
    "a small deviation of our rhessi mass model from the true amount of material can make a considerable difference in the number of observed photons . for @xmath49 degrees",
    ", this should be a small problem because the lateral shielding is thin .",
    "but for @xmath12 from 10 to 50 degrees this is an issue , and less prominently also from 130 to 160 degrees .",
    "simulation quality also gets better with higher energy .",
    "this is fortunate for the current analysis which relies on high - energy properties of grb spectra .",
    "let @xmath40 be the number of grb photons per energy bin .",
    "the peak energy @xmath50  is defined as the energy for which @xmath51 is maximal .",
    "the spectrum in the @xmath52  representation has at least one maximum because the total emitted energy must be finite : @xmath53 .",
    "many instruments can see such a maximum @xmath50  within their energy range .",
    "different mathematical functions , sometimes called models , can describe such a shape .",
    "a collection is presented in this section .",
    "the simplest spectral function is a power law ( * pl * ) : @xmath54 where @xmath39 is a normalization energy , e.g. @xmath55  .",
    "the pl has no peak energy .",
    "it rarely fits a grb spectrum over the entire observed energy range , but it is often useful for a limited energy band .",
    "indeed , every spectrum can be fit by several joined pls .",
    "one simple way to account for a spectral softening and a peak energy is the cut off power law ( * cpl * ) : @xmath56 if @xmath57 then @xmath58 .",
    "another way to account for a spectral break is the broken power law ( * bpl * ) consisting of two joined pls @xmath59 if @xmath57 and @xmath60 , then @xmath61 .",
    "this function is not continuously differentiable .    a smooth transition between the two power laws is realized by the empirical * band * function @xcite .",
    "this is a smooth composition of a cpl for low energies and a pl for high energies : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 again , @xmath39 is a normalization energy , e.g. @xmath55  . if @xmath57 and @xmath60 , then @xmath58 . if @xmath65 or if @xmath66  lies at the upper limit of the observed energy range , then the band function turns into a cpl .",
    "as already pointed out by @xcite , section 3.3.1 . , the low energy photon index , the curvature of the spectrum , and its peak energy are represented with only two parameters , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .    sometimes a blackbody spectrum plus power law is used for spectral fitting , see e.g.  @xcite . we will call this the * bbpl * : @xmath69 we choose @xmath70 , the peak energy of the blackbody component . the bbpl function can fit a spectral hardening at high energies .    when fitting with the bbpl model , it is often found that the pl component does not fit simultaneously at low and at high energies .",
    "this is also mentioned by @xcite .",
    "we therefore invented a blackbody plus modified power law ( * bbmpl * ) : @xmath71 we choose again @xmath72 . the modification of the power law component was borrowed from the cannonball model ( see next ) .",
    "the bbmpl function can describe a spectral hardening at high energies .    the cannonball model * cbm * @xcite makes a prediction for the spectral shape of the prompt grb emission .",
    "it consists of a cpl and a modified power law : @xmath73 according to @xcite , eq .",
    "47 , or @xcite , eq .  13 .",
    "the theoretically expected values are @xmath74 and @xmath3 .",
    "the cbm  function eq .",
    "eq : cb applies strictly speaking only to the spectrum caused by a single cannonball , i.e.  for every single peak of a grb .",
    "it is often observed that the peak energy @xmath50  is a more stable fit parameter than the parameter @xmath68 in the band function ( eq .  eq : band ) or in the cpl ( eq .  eq : cpl ) .",
    "therefore , we use @xmath75 as a fit parameter . similarly , we use @xmath76 as a fit parameter in the case of cbm  ( eq .  eq : cb ) .    a word about fitting cbm : for the high energy part , it has two parameters , whereas the band function has only one . already when fitting the band function , it is often observed that the high energy power law index is poorly constrained , because the high energy data tend to have large statistical errors .",
    "this is even worse for cbm  with two high energy parameters .",

    "in the cases where we could fit @xmath77 , we found values close to 2.1 ( table  [ tab : cb_pars ] ) .    for the factor @xmath105 of the modified pl component in the cbm  function we typically found values of the order @xmath170 .",
    "an exception is grb 031111 , where @xmath105 is of the order 1.0 , but with a large error ( @xmath171 ) .",

    "our practice to freeze @xmath77 at its theoretically predicted value in cases of bad convergence seems to be acceptable .",

    "the two functions fit the observed spectrum equally well with a slight preference for the band function . at high energies however ( typically above several times the peak energy )",
    "the two functions are different , the spectral hardening being a unique feature of the cbm  function .",
    "there is only one case , namely grb 021206 , where this hardening is observed . for the rear data going up to high energies",
    ", a band function fit gives @xmath174 ( see table  [ tab : chi2 ] ) .",
    "this is not acceptable at @xmath175% probability of being accidentally so high .",
    "the cbm  fit on the other hand gives @xmath176 , which is fully acceptable at a @xmath177% level .",
    "we would like to stress again that , while the cbm  gives acceptable fits for _ all _ cases , the band function fails in one case .",
    "this seems enough to us to give some credit to the cbm .",
    "but it is , of course , no proof that the cbm  is the only theory capable of describing the spectrum of grb 021206 .",
    "for example , a band function plus a pl with @xmath178 would also fit .",
    "but there is no theory to predict such a shape . to our knowledge",

    "we cite from their summary : `` _ we confirmed , using a much larger sample , that the most common value for the low - energy index is @xmath179 _ in our notation ] _",

    "note that the @xmath77 values of the cbm  are systematically lower than the @xmath77 values of the band function , compare tables [ tab : cb_pars ] and [ tab : band_pars ] . from band function fits to batse grbs , it is known that @xmath77 is clustered around 2.3 , with a long tail towards higher values , see @xcite .",
    "for cbm  we would expect @xmath77 to cluster at slightly lower values .    for criticism of the cbm ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite , but see also the answer by @xcite .",
    "the difference of a cbm  spectrum and band function is the hardening at high energies .",
    "this becomes visible  for the grbs studied here  in the few  region , but it depends on the peak energy and the factor @xmath105 . for @xmath141 and @xmath184",
    "the hardening typically appears at several times the peak energy and the second term dominates at 10 times the peak energy . for the spectral fit of xrfs done by @xcite",
    ", the spectral hardening is expected in the few hundred  region , just where the number of photons detected runs low .",
    "most of our grbs also suffer from this lack of statistics at high energies , preventing the detection of a hardening .",
    "a spectral coverage of two decades and good detection efficiency at high energies is necessary to experimentally observe the full shape of the cbm  function . in the case of grb 021206",
    "we were able to detect this hardening , thanks to rhessi s broad energy range ( 30  to 15  ) , and because this is one of the brightest grbs ever observed .",
    "there is a grb observed by smm from 20 kev up to 100 mev , namely grb 840805 .",
    "as reported by @xcite , the spectrum of this burst shows emission up 100 mev . in order to fit the spectrum , ``",
    "a classical thermal synchrotron function plus a power law '' was used .",
    "the power law component was required to fit the data above about 6 mev .",
    "this is a hint of a spectral hardening around 6 mev , and we suppose that the spectrum of this grb can be fit by a cbm  function .",
    "the spectral hardening observed in grb 941017 @xcite seems to be different .",
    "the photon index of grb 941017 above a few  is @xmath108 .",
    "this case is discussed by @xcite as a possible additional feature in the cbm  spectrum .      in order to find more grb spectra that show the hardening characteristic for the cbm  function , strong grbs have to be observed over a broad enough energy range . with the forthcoming glast mission",
    ", we expect that more such spectra will be observed .",
    "but also joint analyses with more than one instrument could reveal this hardening .",
    "we therefore suggest :    @xmath133 to search for cbm  spectrum candidates among joint swift / rhessi grbs and xrfs , and joint swift / konus grbs .",
    "@xmath133 to reanalyse some batse bursts .",
    "looking at the batse spectra published by @xcite , we suppose that the cbm  can possibly improve the fits of grb 980329 , grb 990123 , and grb 990510 .",

    "19 of @xcite , looks like a promising candidate as well .",
    "@xmath133 to search in konus data for suitable grbs .",
