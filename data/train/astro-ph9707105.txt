    "accreting pulsars consist of rotating , magnetized neutron stars that accrete matter from a companion ( pringle & rees 1972 ; davidson & ostriker 1971 ) .",

    "accretion is then centrifugally inhibited . in this `` propellor '' regime",
    ", the neutron star may spin down rapidly .",
    "neutron stars accreting at a constant rate thus tend toward an equilibrium spin period where @xmath19 , given by    @xmath20    the relation between torque and luminosity near equilibrium is expected to be more complicated than equation  ( [ n ] ) .",
    "magnetic accretion occurs in a variety of astrophysical systems , including magnetic cvs and t tauri stars ( warner 1990 ; konigl et al . 1991 ) .",
    "accreting pulsars are well suited for studying accretion phenomena .",
    "their small moments of inertia and strong magnetic fields result in measureable changes in the spin frequency , @xmath21 , in hours to days with current instruments ( e.g. nagase 1989 ) .",
    "in particular , accreting pulsars open the possibility of probing the interaction between material in the accretion disk and the magnetic field through measurements of how @xmath22 depends upon @xmath23 .    a correlation between spin - up rate and x - ray luminosity has been observed in outbursts of 5 transient systems ; between the spin - up rate and the 120 kev flux measured with exosat in ( parmar , white & stella 1989 ; parmar et al .",

    "however , continuous measurements with batse show no correlation between orbital phase and either the magnitude or the sense of the accretion torque ( koh et al . 1997 ) .    in this paper we present measurements of x - ray flux for the accreting pulsars 4u  162667 and gx  3012 made with the all - sky monitor ( asm ) on the _ ginga _ satellite over the course of 4.5 years .",
    "we describe the asm in section 2 . although the `` snapshots '' of source flux taken by the asm can not be used to determine the frequency histories of pulsed sources , they are a long term , uniform set of measurements that can be correlated with other measurements . in particular , they complement measurements of pulse frequency made with batse , whose low - energy cutoff of @xmath020kev misses most of the bolometric luminosity of most pulsars , a point we return to in the discussion .",
    "the two instruments overlapped from 1991 april  october .",

    "observationally , partial covering can not be ruled out .",
    "however , the flux from 4u  162667 is low enough that even for a distance of 10kpc the luminosity is substantially sub eddington . we do not expect the physical conditions associated with partial absorption in wind - fed systems like as vela x-1 , such as an accretion wake , to be present .    in",

    "the two episodes of steady spin up observed with batse in gx  3012 were probably associated with the formation and accretion of a disk . during both episodes ,",
    "the 2055kev pulsed flux was @xmath050% higher than average .",
    "however , since the average 120kev flux is 3 times larger than the average 2055kev pulsed flux ( see figure 8) , a change in spectral shape or pulsed fraction could have caused the enhancement seen by batse .",

    "however , the _ ginga _ asm flux , folded at the orbital period , is in good agreement with the batse pulsed flux folded with the same orbit .",
    "this agreement makes it unlikely that the increase of pulsed flux during the spin - up episode resulted just from a change in spectral shape or pulsed fraction , and strongly supports the correlation between luminosity and accretion torque inferred from the batse measurements .",
    "the flux enhancement seen with the _ ginga _ asm during the periastron passage prior to spin - up is further evidence for an increase in total flux during spinup . on the other hand ,",
    "such an enhancement is seen in other periastron passages , and no such enhancement in the 2055kev pulsed flux is seen with batse during the periastron passage prior to spin up relative to other periastron passages .",
