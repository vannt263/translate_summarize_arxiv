    "a necessary condition for the genuine entanglement of a @xmath42 system is that all dimensions of the four particles shall be involved in the entanglement .",

    "for example , a particle with dimension @xmath151 in a @xmath152 system would always have one effective dimension unentangled and it would have at most the genuine entanglement of @xmath153 . for @xmath154 ,",

    "@xcite , this state would be regarded as one single family @xmath187 regardless of the values of @xmath81 ( still satisfying the condition of eq.([3lambda ] ) ) , @xmath188 , and no further assessment of the slocc equivalence for the states @xmath189 with the parameters of different values may be made .",
    "according to the method presented here , the matrix - pair form of the state @xmath189 is @xmath190 here @xmath191 it has already been the standard form of a @xmath181 system . from @xcite , we have the following two facts concerning this standard form .",
    "first , the operations of @xmath192 will transform the state into @xmath193 the continuous parameter @xmath194/[\\lambda_3(\\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2)]$ ] , the cross ratio for the quadruple @xmath195 , is invariant under @xmath69 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 which are the invertible operators maintaining the invariance of the standard form .",
    "second , there is a residual symmetry for @xmath198 whose generators are @xmath199 , @xmath200 .",
    "thus @xmath201 with @xmath202 are all slocc equivalent .",
    "the transformation matrices for @xmath203 and @xmath204 are @xmath205 thus @xmath201 is a continuous entanglement family of a @xmath206 system .",
    "however when the values of @xmath198 are in the set @xmath207 , @xmath201s will belong to the same entanglement family , e.g. @xmath208 , @xmath209 , and @xmath210 belong to the same @xmath174 entanglement family .    here",
    "we use the theorem [ theorem-2lmn ] to verify the slocc equivalence of the entangled states @xmath201 , @xmath211 , where all of them belong to the same entanglement family . because the states are represented in the form of @xmath212 due to @xmath213",
    ", we shall apply the matrix realignment method to the transformation matrices @xmath40s which connect the different entangled states @xmath201 within the same entanglement family . as the @xmath40s act on the bipartite hilbert space of @xmath15 , their matrix realignment according to the factorization @xmath214 are @xmath215 where @xmath216 are just the @xmath40 operators that bring about the symmetry operations @xmath204 , @xmath203 in eqs.([symmetry - g ] ) and ( [ symmetry - f ] ) .",
    "it is clear that none of them in eq.([regalign - fg ] ) can have rank one , therefore the transformation operations relating the @xmath198s in the set @xmath217 can not be decomposed into direct products of two submatrices .",
    "we conclude that the states @xmath201 with different values of @xmath198 in the same entanglement family are slocc inequivalent , e.g. although @xmath208 , @xmath209 , and @xmath210 belong to the same entanglement family , they are not slocc equivalent to each other as the @xmath174 quantum states .      the total number of entanglement families of a @xmath218 system is obtained from eq.([family - num ] ) as @xmath219 in order to show the generalities of the method , we generate a random quantum state for a @xmath177 system ( using built - in function _ randominteger _ [ 1,\\{4,6 } ] of mathematica ) , which is @xmath220 , where @xmath221 in the quantum state notation , it is @xmath222 the rank of @xmath223 is 4 , and the following operations @xmath224 will make @xmath225 the matrix - pair @xmath226 is the standard form for the randomly generated state @xmath7 . it is invariant under the following operations @xmath227 the operations that stated in eq.([matrix - pair - invariant ] ) are @xmath228 where @xmath229 are arbitrary parameters which keep @xmath82 , @xmath230 invertible .",
    "the transformation matrices @xmath231 , and @xmath232 are thus readily obtained from the construction of the standard form .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the details of the construction of the standard form of a tripartite state with one qubit .",
    "suppose another quantum state @xmath9 of @xmath177 has the same standard form as that of @xmath7 in eq.([2432-standard ] ) .",
    "we would obtain the corresponding transformation matrices @xmath233 , @xmath234 , @xmath235 while constructing the standard form from @xmath9 .",
    "thus by theorem [ theorem-2lmn ] , @xmath7 and @xmath9 are slocc equivalent if and only if the matrix realignment @xmath236 could have rank one according to the dimensional factorization @xmath237 .",
    "the example suggests that the scheme works better for higher dimensions , especially in the case of @xmath238 .",
    "in conclusion , we propose a practical scheme for the entanglement classification of a @xmath0 pure system under slocc .",
    "the method functions by distinguishing the entanglement classes via their standard forms together with their transformation routes to the standard forms . not only all the different entanglement classes but",
    "also the transformation matrices are obtained through the method .",
    "this gives the complete classification of the entangled states of @xmath72 under slocc , which has not yet been addressed in recent literature .",
    "the method also reveals that the standard form and the routes to it may be combined to determine the entanglement equivalence under slocc which greatly reduces the complexity of the problem .",
