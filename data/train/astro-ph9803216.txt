    "evans for his sn search ( private communication ) , he missed the sn because its brightness apparently never exceeded his detection limit .",
    "the first spectrum showed the main features of type ii sne , but also revealed peculiarities which make this object unique .",
    "particularly noteworthy were the extremely slow expansion velocities , the red color and the strong lines ( @xcite ) .",
    "a campaign of photometric and spectroscopic observations was therefore promptly started at eso and ctio .",
    "the complete data set will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the sn was intrinsically faint compared to other sne  ii . if we assume a distance modulus of @xmath10 mag for ngc  1536 ( @xmath11  mpc@xmath12 ; @xcite ) , and a@xmath13 ( rc3 ) , a set of closely spaced non - detections by evans sets an upper limit to the sn luminosity of ( max ) @xmath14 .",
    "this is about 2 magnitudes fainter than regular sne  ii at maximum ( @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ lc_abs ] we compare the absolute v light curve of with those of other sne  ii : the double  peaked sn  1987a , the prototypical sniib 1993j and the linear sn  1979c . even with the uncertainties on the epoch of maximum and in the distance modulus , was definitely fainter than all of these objects .",

    "the color of at discovery was unusually red .",
    "no sign of interstellar absorption lines , which are expected in case of strong extinction , is present in the spectra .",
    "reddened rapidly over the first few weeks after discovery , reaching a maximum @xmath15 in mid - february , and then turned gradually bluer . the analogy with the color curves of other sne  ii , which reach the red - most point between 40 and 80 days after peak luminosity",
    ", indicates that maximum light should have occurred around j.d .",

    "a bolometric light curve is needed for a proper analysis of the energetics .",
    "unfortunately , most of our observations only cover the optical domain . only at one phase",
    "are nearly simultaneous optical ( jan.31 ) and ir ( jan.27 ) spectra available .",
    "the overall luminosity between 0.35 and 2.3 @xmath17 in the combined spectrum is log(@xmath18 ) = 40.83 erg s@xmath12 . at that epoch",
    "the color is still sufficiently blue that schmidt s ( 1998 ) empirical bolometric corrections to v can be used .",
    "one then obtains log(@xmath18 ) = 40.96 erg s@xmath12 , in good agreement with the spectrophotometry . at",
    "later phases the color of was so red that schmidt s correction can not be applied .",
    "however , the available spectra show that at all epochs most of the energy was radiated in the v and r bands and that the color evolution is mostly due to variations in the b band , where the flux is much smaller .",
    "therefore , during the photospheric phase we assumed that the bolometric light curve can be described reasonably well by applying a constant bolometric correction to the v magnitudes .",
    "the bolometric light curve thus derived is shown in the insert of fig .",
    "[ lc_abs ] .",
    "the last point has been obtained adopting for the same @xmath19 ratio as for sn  1987a in the nebular epoch ( @xcite ) .",
    "although in sn  1987a the @xmath1rays from the decay were not completely deposited ( @xcite ) , the late time decline of sn  1987a was close to the decay rate of .",
    "the mass of ejected by sn  1987a was @xmath20 0.075  ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "assuming for the same @xmath1ray deposition as in sn  1987a , the ratio of the luminosities on the tail of the light curves can be used to determine the mass of synthesized in the explosion of .",
    "we then obtain a ratio @xmath21(87a)/@xmath21(97d ) @xmath22 . taking into account the uncertainties in the determination of the epoch of maximum and of the bolometric luminosity ,",
    "the mass of ejected by is very small , between 0.001 and 0.004 .    a comparison with sn  1987a ( fig .",
    "[ 97dvs87a ] ) shows general similarities with respect to p - cygni lines of , , and , and more subtle differences .",
    "these latter are emphasized by the strengths of the absorption lines and possibly those of other s  process elements .",
    "sn  1987a showed strong lines of , the analysis of which ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) suggested an enhanced abundance of barium .",
    "shows even stronger lines of , with the identification of an array of multiplets , but , as we shall discuss later , an overabundance of barium is not required because a lower temperature prevails in the envelope .",
    "strong lines of , also an s  process element , were also observed in the ir spectrum taken on jan.27 ( @xcite ) . in this spectrum the 10830 line , which is the dominant feature in the ir spectra of other sne  ii , is not clearly detected , although it might affect the blue wing of 10914 .",
    "finally , one of the most striking peculiarities of is the low expansion velocity of the ejecta , approximately 1200 , as measured from the line absorption minima .",
    "only the strong lines show somewhat higher velocities , but it is well known that strong lines may form in outer parts of the envelope and that stratification effects may also be present . as we will discuss later ( sect .",
    "3.2 ) , the small velocity constrains the epoch of the first spectrum to be @xmath23 days .",
    "the light curve of sn  1997d is unique because the luminosity is low , both at ` maximum light ' and on the radioactive tail .",
    "these properties , along with the narrowness of the lines and the redness of the continuum , can be used to deduce the physical characteristics of the progenitor and of the explosion .",
    "the progenitor model used here is that of a 26  star with an 8 he core at the beginning of collapse ( @xcite ) and an 18 h - rich envelope .",
    "the stellar radius is 0  = 300 , which is 3 - 5 times smaller than typical red supergiants .",
    "the explosion was simulated using a 1-d lagrangian hydrodynamical code ( @xcite ) with an energy of @xmath24 ergs and the ejection of 0.002 of . in order to eject a small amount of",
    ", most of the material of the innermost region where si is burned to ni has to fall back on the degenerate neutron core where it is photodisintegrated before emitting @xmath25rays in forming the compact remnant .",
    "this is used to place the mass cut , resulting in a collapsing core of 1.8 , and ejecta mass of 24.2 .",
    "our model light curve ( fig .",
    "[ lc_mod ] ) successfully reproduces the main characteristics of the observations .",
    "the model parameters are constrained as follows .",
    "the early light curve is powered by shock heating , i.e. , the gradual release of deposited shock energy .",
    "after the peak , the model light curve enters a slight plateau phase lasting about 40 days ( fig .",
    "[ lc_mod ] ) ; during this period , the recombination wave moves inwards in mass through the h envelope down to the he core .",
    "the peak luminosity ( @xmath26 14.65 ) depends on 0 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . in order to achieve a consistent model ,",
    "the progenitor radius can not exceed 300 . for larger radii",
    ", the sn would have been too bright at shock breakout . after the plateau the light curve drops over 2 magnitudes to the radioactive tail .",
    "the luminosity and shape of the tail depend on the mass and on @xmath29 .",
    "the mass determines the absolute magnitude and @xmath29 determines the decline rate .",
    "the tail of sn  1997d follows the decay rate as in sn  1987a . for the sn  1997d model , @xmath30 ergs @xmath12",
    "this is @xmath20 10 times smaller than in sn  1987a , and gives the low velocity and the complete trapping of the @xmath1-rays .",
    "the low luminosity tail is reproduced with the low mass of 0.002 .",
    "we have selected the current model through an elimination process involving 7 models , which we will discuss in a subsequent paper . for models with a small ejected mass ( m @xmath31 20 ) the plateau is too short , giving a time from explosion to discovery of @xmath31 50 days , inconsistent with the spectra .",
    "the tail of sn 1997d falls at the decay rate , which suggests two possibilities : 1 ) the ejecta is optically thick to the @xmath1-rays and the tail reflects the total mass ejected ; or 2 ) the ejecta is optically thin to the @xmath1-rays and the tail is powered by annihilation of the trapped positrons . since the positrons carry only 3.7% of the decay energy , this latter case would imply a normal production",
    ". this can only be true if the opacity to @xmath1-rays is less than one , i.e. if the total mass of the ejecta is @xmath32 .",
    "a simple estimate shows that for this to be the case the mass of the ejecta would have to be less than the mass of ejected alone .",
    "using for the tail the values : @xmath1-ray opacity , @xmath33 , velocity , @xmath34 km / s and time , t = 70 days , we get @xmath35 . thus the tail can not be powered by positron annihilation and we therefore explore models in which the ejecta is optically thick to @xmath1-rays .",
    "models with larger energies give higher material velocities and broader spectral lines , which is again inconsistent with the observations . for models with larger @xmath29",
    "the light curve is too bright and the plateau is too short",
    ". models with smaller progenitor radii have plateaus that are too short . to attain the same final kinetic energy , the shock , in a more compact star ,",
    "expands the ejecta , and thus cools it , much more rapidly than for a star with a larger radius .",
    "the result is that the photosphere moves inward faster , and the plateau is shorter .",
    "we used the explosion model described above to compute synthetic spectra for two epochs with a monte carlo spectrum synthesis code , which is based on that described in mazzali & lucy ( 1993 ) but has been improved to include photon cascades ( mazzali & lucy 1998 , in preparation ) .    on jan .",
    "17 the red continuum indicates a photospheric temperature @xmath36 k. the other input parameters are the expansion velocity ( @xmath37 ) and the epoch of explosion .",
    "given the luminosity as deduced in sect .",
    "[ prop ] , the required temperature can only be achieved with a rather large radius of about 6000 . since @xmath38",
    ", this implies @xmath39 days for the first spectrum .",
    "therefore , we deduce that the peak was missed by about 50 days , that a plateau followed , and that the sn was first observed on the decline to the tail .",
    "the model spectrum ( fig .  [ syn_sp1 ] ) matches the observed one well with the exception of some features in the red , where the model continuum is also somewhat too high , and of the  absorption .",
    "most of the narrow absorption lines are well reproduced .",
    "in particular , 6497 is stronger than .",
    "since solar abundances were used , this is just a temperature effect , and no overabundance of ba is required .",
    "the temperature is low enough for the / ratio to be small , which results in strong lines , while the same low temperature makes weak .",
    "the narrow lines are clearly the result of a low explosion energy .",
    "the fact that the lines are so narrow allows a reasonably accurate determination of the mass above the photosphere .",
    "values ranging between 10 and 20m@xmath40 give acceptable spectra .",
    "the model adopted here has 14.5m@xmath40 above 970 .",
    "models with a smaller mass give lines too shallow if @xmath41 .",
    "synthetic spectra show that the requirement that @xmath42 days on 17 jan . is a rather strong one .",
    "if the explosion took place closer to discovery , i.e. @xmath43 days , the observed expansion velocity implies a small radius . together with the derived luminosity , this results in a higher @xmath4 than required . in this case , the / ratio increases and the line intensities decrease . if on the other hand the explosion occurred earlier , so that @xmath44 days , the radius is too large and the temperature becomes too low .",
    "when the temperature drops below 5000k , lines of and absorb most of the radiation below 4500 and the synthetic spectrum changes dramatically .",
    "we also computed a synthetic spectrum of our selected explosion model evolved to match the 6 feb .",
    "the fitting was satisfactory using an epoch consistent with @xmath45 days on jan.17 .",
    "is among the least luminous type ii supernovae known to date .",
    "the low luminosity persists also in the tail , where the decline rate is close to that of a -powered tail",
    ".  is also characterized by a low temperature and a very low expansion velocity .",
    "these features are well reproduced by an explosion model with a relatively small progenitor radius ( 300 ) , massive ejecta ( @xmath20 24 ) , low explosion energy ( @xmath46 ergs ) , and small ejected mass ( @xmath20 0.002 ) .",
    "the neutrino - heating mechanism of massive star explosions is not well understood , so the explosion energy and the amount of  ejected as a function of progenitor mass are difficult to predict from the hydrodynamical models . according to pre - supernova model calculations , stars more massive than @xmath20 25  form an fe core in a greater gravitational potential because of the significantly smaller c / o ratio and the consequently weak carbon shell burning ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . therefore ,",
    "if the efficiency of neutrino heating does not change with exploding mass , more massive stars tend to produce lower explosion energies , and they suffer from more fall - back of material onto the collapsed remnant .",
    "the mass cut is then placed further out",
    ". however , the progenitor must be less massive than the wolf - rayet progenitors ( i.e. , 30 - 40 ) because of the presence of an envelope with a mass of at least 15  above the photosphere at day 50 .",
    "stars in the range @xmath20 10 - 25  are likely to explode with typical explosion energies of @xmath47 ergs , and to produce 0.07 - 0.15  of , as indicated by the brightness and light curve shapes of sn 1993j , sn 1987a and of type ibc supernovae ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "stars of 8 - 10 are predicted to produce little  and other heavy elements ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , these stars are at the top of the agb in the pre - supernova stages ( @xcite ) , which is inconsistent with the small radius of .",
    "also , synthetic spectra obtained from the low mass models have shallow absorption lines compared to the observations .    in conclusion ,",
    "the progenitor of  was probably as massive as 25 - 40 .",
    "our 26  model is in this mass range , thus being consistent with the low @xmath29 and the small  mass .",
    "the presupernova radius depends on many parameters , and the reason for its being rather small in is an open question .",
    "spectral models appear to rule out the case of low metallicity and he enhancement .",
    "a possible scenario involves a close binary system in which the companion star spiraled in to make the envelope more massive ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ejection of a small mass of  provides a constraint on the mass of the collapsed remnant , @xmath48 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in our 26  model ,",
    "is @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath48 were assumed to be smaller , more  would be ejected : e.g. if @xmath50 , then m ( ) = 0.1 . for more massive progenitor models",
    ", @xmath48 would be larger than 1.8 .",
    "if the equation of state of nuclear matter is relatively soft , the maximum ( gravitational ) mass of a cold neutron star is @xmath20 1.5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if this is the case , the remnant of  must be a small - mass black hole , and the low luminosity tail of  might be a signature of the formation of such an object",
