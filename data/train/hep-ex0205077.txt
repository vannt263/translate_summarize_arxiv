    "the new hera interaction regions are designed to achieve a maximum possible luminosity by strongly focusing the proton beam .",
    "this results in @xmath0-function values at the interaction point ( ip ) which are in the range of the bunch length .",
    "this new design includes superconducting combined function magnets inside the colliding beam detectors h1 and zeus which focus the @xmath1gev lepton beam in the vertical plane and bend the beam away from the @xmath2gev proton beam .",
    "this allows to place the low @xmath0 magnet for the protons as close as 11 m to the ip .",
    "the synchrotron radiation produced by the beam separation has to be absorbed far away from the ip .",
    "therefore the vacuum chambers downstream of the ip have a keyhole shape to allow the synchrotron radiation fan to propagate through the low  beta quadrupoles .",
    "these have a 28 mm gap between the coils .",
    "the aperture of the flat part of the downstream vacuum chambers is only 18 mm .",
    "this is critical because of the height of the synchrotron radiation that is generated in the upstream low",
    " beta quadrupoles . due to the large vertical divergence of the beam in these quadrupoles",
    ", the synchrotron radiation fan will only fit inside the keyhole shape if the quadrupoles in the low - beta region are aligned to a precision of better than @xmath3 mm . by optical surveying",
    ", a precision of about @xmath4 mm can be achieved under optimum conditions which are not given in the interaction region ( ir ) with shielding walls and a large detector in between the two halves of the straight section .",
    "based alignment was proposed to verify specifications that can not be verified to a satisfactory precision by the survey procedure .",
    "a precision of magnet alignment of @xmath5 mm appears to be desirable .",
    "the magnets of the hera ir are movable via remote control and can be adjusted in an iterative way without access to the magnets .",
    "beam  based alignment is a technique of deriving the position of a quadrupole magnet from the analysis of difference orbits that are generated by the variation of the strength of this quadrupole . if the central orbit of the beam is not in the center of the quadrupole , the beam experiences a dipole field that changes the orbit .",
    "position monitors detect the changes of the orbit around the ring .",
    "the offset of the beam with respect to the quadrupole axis is then determined by analysis of the difference orbit .",
    "the result may be used to calibrate the offsets of nearby beam position monitors or to mechanically re - align the quadrupole magnets .",
    "this technique has been invented to optimize the performance of the slc @xcite .",
    "it has also been successfully applied to calibrate the beam position monitors in the hera electron ring , where it was the basis for an orbit steering algorithm of minimizing the residual vertical kicks which yielded a record electron spin polarization @xcite .",
    "future accelerators such as nlc will depend heavily on extensive beam  based steering algorithms @xcite .",
    "the application of beam  based alignment techniques to adjust the magnet positions in the new hera interaction region however encountered a number of difficulties and problems . the analysis and the solutions of these problems can be helpful for future application of beam  based alignment , especially in interaction regions .",
    "the difficulties we encountered have to do with circumstances that might be considered typical for an interaction region : ( a ) the quadrupoles are quite strong and long .",
    "therefore the thin lens approximation is quite imprecise .",
    "( b ) the effects of angular magnet offsets become significant .",
    "( c ) the possibilities to steer the beam are limited as long as the alignment is not within specifications .",
    "( d ) the beam orbit has design offsets and design angles with respect to the axis of the low - beta quadrupoles .",
    "( e ) often quadrupoles do not have a beam position monitor in their vicinity . under these circumstances",
    "the results are very sensitive to errors and it turned out to be very difficult to achieve the desired precision of the beam  based alignment of @xmath5 mm . moreover , since the beam can not be centered in all the magnets simultaneously , a global analysis of the magnet positions becomes necessary which uses the results of the beam  based alignment measurements in all the ir quadrupoles .",
    "in the following we describe the hera interaction region to the extent relevant for synchrotron radiation background and beam  based alignment of the low  beta quadrupoles .",
    "the proton and lepton beams collide head on in the interaction point .",
    "the two beams are separated by combined function magnets , which start on both sides at 2 m from the ip .",
    "because of the strong synchrotron radiation power of together approximately @xmath6kw generated in these magnets , the layout is not symmetric . on the left side from which the lepton",
    "beam enters , there is a @xmath7 m long relatively low field superconducting magnet ( go ) of @xmath8 mm full aperture which deflects the leptons by @xmath9mrad and focuses them in the vertical plane as the first lens of a low  beta triplet . on the right side of the ip ,",
    "these functions are provided by a combination of a short ( 1.3 m length ) but large full aperture ( 120 mm ) superconducting combined function magnet ( gg ) and a normal conducting conventional quadrupole ( gi ) with a length of 1.88 m .",
    "these innermost magnets are complemented by a horizontally focusing quadrupole of type gi and a vertically focusing magnet ( gj ) of 1.88 m length on both sides of the ip .",
    "the double  doublet structure for focusing the protons starts at 11.2 m on each side of the ip with a half quadrupole with septum plate .",
    "table [ tb : quadorb ] shows the main parameters of the hera ir quadrupoles and the location of the positron design orbit relative to the quadrupole axis in the center of each ir magnet . for electron / proton collisions",
    "the values are slightly different . due to spin",
    "matching requirements it has not been possible to use exactly these design parameters for the quadrupoles , and in the routinely used optics files the computed path for injection and for luminosity operation differ by up to 0.5 mm in some quadrupoles .",
    ".design parameters for the hera ir quadrupoles and the offset of the positron design orbit in the center of these quadrupoles .",
    "[ tb : quadorb ] [ cols=\"<,<,>,^ , > , > , > \" , ]      the magnet positions as the result of a fit of the measurements can be written as @xmath10 the @xmath11 are the first @xmath12 components of the vector @xmath13 , the @xmath14 are the components of @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the matrix of the least square fit in equation ( [ eqn49 ] ) .",
    "we now introduce sets of random errors of the input variables labeled by @xmath17 @xmath18 which gives the error of the magnet positions ( neglecting second order terms ) @xmath19 we now calculate the expectation value of @xmath20 by squaring the expression and by subsequently averaging over the error set @xmath17 .",
    "we assume that for random errors the following correlations hold : @xmath21 and @xmath22 . with this",
    "we finally obtain @xmath23 the first sum has typically values of @xmath24 to @xmath9 when evaluated for the hera ir .",
    "thus an error of a single measurement @xmath25 mm propagates , yielding approximately an error of @xmath4 mm in the reconstructed magnet position .",
    "however , these are only first observations for the case of hera where the here presented version of beam - based alignment is currently being heavily used in the commissioning process .",
    "this particular application and experiences with this method will thus be reported in a separate paper after the successful commissioning of the hera luminosity upgrade .",
    "we have introduced a beam based alignment method for a general class of combined function magnets that can be encountered in collider interaction regions .",
    "while this method can in principal determine alignment angles , we have shown that these angles would be very prone to measurement errors .",
    "we have therefore introduced a procedure to use the angular alignment to strongly improve the accuracy of the position determination by one to two orders of magnitude . furthermore a procedure has been presented to determine global magnet positions after the closed orbit deviation from the quadrupole axis has been measured throughout the interaction region .",
