    "in 2015 , we proposed a new theoretical approach to explain relations between critical temperature of the superconducting gap @xmath0 and the pseudogap @xmath1 observed in the @xmath2-type cuprates @xcite , an example of which is shown in fig  [ scdome ] , reproduced from hfner _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "a key element of the theory was based on findings @xcite indicating a heterogeneous , scale free ( fractal ) distribution of static dopants @xmath3 , whose correlation length , increases with dopant ( charge ) density @xmath4 up to optimum doping and then declines as @xmath4 continues to increase ( associated with a reduction in correlation length ) , as space constraints lead to dopant packing into a more homogenous lattice arrangement @xcite .        against this background , we developed theory @xcite that @xmath0 relations are linked with the emergence of the fractal network of charge induced quantum potentials which at a critical percolation threshold , merge , leading to a transition from a collection of charges @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is a microscopic action ) , into macroscopic fluctuations , creating a complex geodesic velocity field ( fig  [ charges ] ) , represented by a macroscopic wave function @xmath7    _ n=1^n_d _ d = e^i a_d/2d , [ eq.68 ] where @xmath8 is a macroscopic action , @xmath9 ( eq [ qmg ] ) is @xmath10 s associated macroscopic quantum potential ( mqp ) and @xmath11 is substituted with a macroscopic parameter @xmath12 , which characterizes the amplitude of fractal fluctuations across the mqp and is therefore specific to the system .",
    "we recall that in the case of standard qm , @xmath11 ; which is itself a geometric property of a fractal space , is defined through the fractal fluctuations as @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath10 and @xmath9 we write a macroscopic schrdinger - like equation ( eq [ schrodinger ] ) , or its equivalent as euler and continuity equations ( eq s [ euler ] and [ cont ] ) , in which @xmath9 ( eq [ qmg ] ) becomes explicit @xcite .              as a next step we consider diffusive and quantum systems as a pair of euler equations , whose detailed derivation and full meaning is outlined in previous papers @xcite .",
    "eq [ quant ] demonstrates a clear equivalence between a standard fluid subjected to a force field and a diffusion system eq .",
    "[ dp ] , where @xmath14 represents a standard diffusion coefficient , with the force expressed in terms of probability density @xmath15 at each point and instant .",
    "@xmath16      the ` diffusion force ' derives from an external potential _",
    "diff=+2d^2 / , [ diffpot ] which introduces a square root of probability in the description of a classical diffusion process .",
    "the quantum force is the exact opposite , derived from the quantum potential , which is internally generated by its fractal geodesics q / m=-2d^2 /.",
    "[ quantpot ]    eq s [ quant ] and [ dp ] offer a fundamental new insight into quantum decoherence in both standard and macroscopic quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the two forms of potential energy compete in a process described by the model of ` quantum brownian motion ' @xcite .",
    "the emergence of ` pointer states ' during the decoherence process is linked to the collapse of a fundamental fractal root structure ( underpinning the fractal velocity field ) to its more stable roots @xcite .",
    "these roots form the preferred set of states of an open system most robust against environmental interaction @xcite , accounting for the transition from a probabilistic to a deterministic classical description @xcite .    within the context of the @xmath2-type cuprates ,",
    "the charge induced fractal landscape of hills and valleys forming the mqp ( @xmath9 ) , visualized in fig [ charges ] , plays a key role in htsc , providing both a macroscopic quantum force supporting macroscopic coherence , and ( as supported by a number of papers @xcite ) a quantum critical , scale free network of channels for the observed superconducting quantum fluid @xmath17 reported by mcelroy _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "as can be seen from fig [ charges ] , geometric constraints associated with the system mean that @xmath17 is inevitably anticorrelated with dopant induced potentials @xcite , in a mechanism which also explains the observed anticorrelation between dopant distribution and charge density wave order recently confirmed by campi _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the outlined theory indicates that the frequency and extent of fluctuations of the mqp is dependent on the fractal dimension @xmath18 and correlation length of the scale free network .",
    "depending on the base material , the conducting fluid may be comprised of electron - pairs coupled by one or more coupling mechanisms @xcite , with electron - pair ( e - pair ) coupling energies significantly higher than conventional sc , leading to more thermally stable e - pairs .    following a process analogous to the dopant system described in eq s [ eq.68]-[cont ] , these coherent fluids ( @xmath19 ) can also be written as a set of schrdinger , euler and continuity equations @xcite .",
    "however , we are now dealing with a ` multiple component ' system , where the full set of equations ( see eq s 85 - 92 @xcite ) includes @xmath9 eq ( [ qmg ] ) as an external potential in the schrdinger equation .",
    "this system of disordered dopants and multiple condensates , which leads to macroscopic quantum coherence is alternatively referred to as ` superstripes ' @xcite ; the symmetry breaking associated with quantum criticality of the fractal network leading to a classical to quantum ` lifschitz ' transition and an associated ` feshbach ' resonance .",
    "one of the key limitations associated with the @xmath2-type cuprates lies in their 2 dimensional lattice structure @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that if a continuous ( scale free ) 3d macroscopic complex path integral ( built from the molecular scale upwards ) could be developed , then significant increases in charge density and mqp strength ( eq [ qmg ] ) , combined with increase in e - pair density of states and collective correlation energy , should theoretically lead to a significant increase in @xmath0 .",
    "this hypothesis is supported in principle by the observation of room temperature macroscopic quantum coherence linked to charged , fractal macromolecular systems ( proteins ) associated with photosynthesis @xcite .",
    "having considered the role of fractal networks and charge density in the emergence of macroscopic quantum coherence in the @xmath2-type cuprates , we reflect on the development of 3d fractal structures identified with quantum criticality @xcite , that could theoretically lead to enhanced @xmath0 in htsc materials .",
    "recent work @xcite reports on the spontaneous emergence of a wide range of plant - like structures from inorganic matter , which supports theory that long range order in plant structures is driven by macroscopic quantum mechanics - type processes underpinned by a fractal network of charge density @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the assembly of molecular - scale fractal networks is driven by a combination of quantum vacuum and thermal fluctuations acting as a sea of harmonic oscillators in combination with charge induced repulsive forces between adjacent charged particles , which influence the dynamics of molecular assembly @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "charge density links to the solvation of @xmath20 , which leads to the release of protons and the subsequent ionization of molecules , with @xmath4 determined by @xmath20 concentration .",
    "increasing @xmath4 leads to an increase in the degree of molecular freedom to interact with environmental fluctuations @xcite .",
    "successive solutions during time evolution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation in a 3d harmonic oscillator potential lead to a model of branching / bifurcation and the emergence of a 3d fractal architecture , whose fractal dimension @xmath18 is dependent on @xmath4 and @xmath21 , for a specific molecular composition @xcite . during this process ,",
    "charge induced potential well s will interconnect , creating a 3d version of fig  [ charges ] , i.e. , a charge induced complex fractal velocity field .",
    "as in eq [ eq.68 ] , this has the effect of transforming quanta of fractal fluctuations into macroscopic fluctuations , represented by a macroscopic wave function which , with its associated mqp ( eq [ qmg ] ) , can be incorporated into a set of euler , continuity and schrdinger - like equations , equivalent to those described for htsc materials in eq s [ schrodinger ] - [ cont ] @xcite .    within such a system ,",
    "the mqp creates a ` structuring ' macroscopic quantum - like force dictating long range molecular assembly , in competition with an external diffusive force associated with the diffusive potential ( eq [ diffpot ] ) which , depending on conditions , leads to the emergence of the wide range of structures observed in the plant kingdom @xcite .",
    "an example of the principle is given in figure 3 , which shows the generation of a flower - like structure , modelled using a schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "considering experimental results , fig  [ structures ] illustrates six examples ( electron micrographs ) of @xmath22 based plant - like structures reproduced from turner and nottale @xcite at varying levels of @xmath4 . above a critical level of @xmath4",
    ", structure takes the form of a confined @xmath23 m diameter , spherical cell - like structure fig  [ structures]a . for a fixed temperature ,",
    "a decline in @xmath4 leads to a subsequent decline in the strength of the mqp in a process of macroscopic decoherence of the complex velocity field to its fractal roots ( pointer states ) .",
    "this process , expressed through a range of intermediate structures of declining spatial coherence such as pod , flower and leaf - like structures in fig s  [ structures]b - d , eventually leads to structures with long - range fractal order ( fig  [ structures]e ) .",
    "when @xmath20 is eliminated completely from the system by purging with nitrogen , @xmath24 , the mqp collapses completely , with molecules , unhindered by repulsive charges forming a crystal lattice ( fig  [ structures]f ) .    apart from monocultures of spherical or crystalline structure ( figs  [ structures]a and [ structures]f ) , at ambient levels of @xmath20 , precise control over intermediate structures found in plants was unachievable , with a range of different structures emerging in response to subtle variation in local conditions at the point of growth",
    "this indicates that in real plants , local conditions at the point of molecular assembly during growth processes must be more tightly controlled .",
    "an example to illustrate this @xcite is seen in the deposition of cellulose in secondary wall thickening in tracheary elements of _ arabidopsis thaliana _ reported by derbyshire _ et al _ @xcite . in this study involving individual stem cells in vitro",
    ", it was shown that microtubules provide the guide for cellulose synthase complexes in combination with a large number ( 605 ) of different microtubule - associated proteins , which form complexes that vary in composition as cell wall structures change during cellulose deposition .    during the transcription of dna through rna to an array of different proteins ( which are a direct reflection of the genetic code ) ,",
    "the subsequent assembly of protein complexes and their charge density is precisely controlled @xcite , offering fine levels of control over average charge density on a protein complex . as",
    "specific protein complexes attach to a growing microtubule , they dictate not only microtubule structure , but also cellulose assembly , through interaction of local levels of charge density with the cellulose synthase complex .",
    "this leads to levels of structural control unachievable in the experimental work on inorganic plant - like structures @xcite .",
    "the complexity associated with control of just one small detail in cell wall assembly in _",
    "arabidopsis thaliana _ highlights the enormous challenges associated with understanding the emergence of structure in plants and living systems in general .",
    "however , whilst a full understanding of even simple biological systems may be decades away , the basic principles identified offer new fundamental insight into the interplay between charge density , thermodynamics and macroscopic quantum processes and their role in defining long range order in biological systems .",
    "the macroscopic quantum processes we have described in plants take the form of a two - component [ coherent ( boson)-classical ( fermion ) ] system .",
    "molecular assembly operates within the framework of macroscopic fluctuations within a charge induced coherent bosonic field , acting as a structuring force in competition with exterior potentials . whilst the system is only partially coherent , many of the phenomena associated with standard quantum theory",
    "are recovered , including quantization , non - dissipation , self - organization , confinement , structuration conditioned by the environment , environmental fluctuations leading to macroscopic quantum decoherence and evolutionary time described by the time dependent schrdinger equation , which describes models of bifurcation an cell duplication @xcite .",
    "these principles offer fresh insight into mechanisms to control molecular assembly in the development of new htsc materials .",
    "if theory is confirmed , it offers the potential to take their macroscopic quantum properties to new levels exemplified by protein complexes in photosynthetic processes @xcite .      through this brief overview",
    "we have established a number of common principles underpinning htsc and biological systems . in both cases , the interplay between charge density and dissipative and macroscopic quantum forces plays a key role in defining both structure and function .",
    "our understanding of these systems is in its infancy .",
    "looking to the future , development of a deeper understanding of how these basic principles can be used to develop new materials requires a multidisciplinary program of research . to date",
    "we have considered just a few examples of a much broader range of potential systems dictated by these theoretical principles .",
    "future work needs to focus on more detailed theory , modelling and controlled experimental studies in both biological and inorganic systems , to determine the impact of atomic / molecular structure , @xmath4 , @xmath21 and other boundary conditions on emergent structures and their properties .",
    "it is clear that we have much to learn from biological systems , such as the use of protein complexes to more precisely control the emergence of structure .    as a first step ,",
    "we need to validate theory that structures with higher @xmath18 and @xmath4 , do indeed exhibit significantly higher levels of @xmath0 .",
    "confirmation of a clear relationship between @xmath4 , @xmath18 and @xmath25 for a specific material would open the door to a new , systematic , _ ab initio _ approach to the development of htsc materials .",
    "at the same time , this work would help confirm theory on macroscopic quantum processes in photosynthetic systems .",
    "we would like to thank hfner _",
    "@xcite for granting permission to use fig [ scdome ] from their paper .",
    "we would also like to acknowledge the role of the cost office , and in particular cost action fp1105 for facilitating the collaboration that led to this work .",
