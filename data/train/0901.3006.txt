    "the development of the new experimental facilities on radioactive beams moved forward the nuclear structure physics to the regions of nuclei far from stability @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting results was the discovery of a new dipole mode at low - excitation energy in nuclei with neutron skin @xcite .",
    "this bunching of @xmath0 states resembling spectral structures known to indicate resonance phenomena was named pygmy dipole resonance ( pdr ) .",
    "the presence of a neutron skin should affect also low - energy quadrupole states .",
    "due to oscillations of neutrons from the surface region one may expect a formation of a soft quadrupole mode , namely pygmy quadrupole resonance ( pqr ) , which resembles the properties of the pdr .    here",
    ", we present our investigations on the dipole and quadrupole excitations in nuclei from n=50 , 82 and z=50 regions .",
    "the approach is based on a hartree - fock - bogoljubov ( hfb ) description of the ground state @xcite by using a phenomenological energy - density functional ( edf ) @xcite .",
    "the excited states are calculated with the quasiparticle - phonon model ( qpm ) @xcite .",
    "the model hamiltonian is given by :    @xmath1    which has the structure of the traditional qpm model @xcite but in detail differs in the physical content as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the hfb term @xmath2 contains two parts : @xmath3 describes the motion of protons and neutrons in a static , spherically - symmetric mean - field .",
    "@xmath4 accounts for the monopole pairing between isospin identical particles with phenomenologically adjusted coupling constants , fitted to data @xcite .",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian compromises microscopic hfb effects @xcite and phenomenological aspects like experimental separation energies and , when available , also charge and mass radii . for numerical convenience",
    "the mean - field potential is parametrized in terms of ( superpositions of ) wood - saxon ( ws ) potentials with adjustable parameters @xcite .",
    "the remaining three terms present the residual interaction @xmath5 . as typical for the qpm , we use separable multipole - multipole @xmath6 and spin - multipole @xmath7 interactions both of isoscalar and isovector type in the particle - hole and multipole pairing @xmath8 in the particle - particle channels , respectively .",
    "the isoscalar and isovector coupling constants are obtained by a fit to energies and transition rates of low - lying vibrational states and high - lying gdr s @xcite .    the nuclear excited states are described by quasiparticle - random - phase- approximation ( qrpa ) phonons .",
    "they are defined as a linear combination of two - quasiparticle creation and annihilation operators as follows : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a single - particle proton or neutron state ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 are time - forward and time - backward operators , coupling proton and neutron two - quasiparticle creation or annihilation operators to a total angular momentum @xmath13 with projection @xmath14 by means of the clebsch - gordan coefficients @xmath15 .",
    "the phonons obey the qrpa equation of motion , which solves the eigenvalue problem , i.e. giving the excitation energies @xmath16 and the time - forward and time - backward amplitudes @xcite @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "sn isotopes ( upper panel ) are displayed for comparison together with the nuclear skin thickness @xmath19 ( lower panel ) .",

    "that information is accessible by considering the one - body transition densities @xmath25 , which are the non - diagonal elements of the nuclear one - body density matrix .",
    "the transition densities are obtained by the matrix elements between the ground state @xmath26 and the excited states @xmath27 .",
    "the analytical procedure for the calculation of the transition densities is presented in details in @xcite .    ; ( right ) proton ( dash line ) and neutron ( solid line ) quadrupole transition densities summed over the qrpa 2@xmath28 excited states in a given energy region ( indicated in the figure ) in @xmath29,title=\"fig : \" ] ; ( right ) proton ( dash line ) and neutron ( solid line ) quadrupole transition densities summed over the qrpa 2@xmath28 excited states in a given energy region ( indicated in the figure ) in @xmath29,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "we have pointed out in our previous papers @xcite that the proper determination of the ground state of the nucleus is essential for the extrapolations of the qpm calculations into unknown mass regions . here",
    ", we put special emphasis on a reliable description of the mean - field part , reproducing as close as possible the g.s .",
    "properties of nuclei like binding energies , root mean square radii , and separation energies to the required accuracy along an isotopic chain .",
    "this is achieved by solving the ground state problem in a semi - microscopic approach @xcite .",
    "the calculated ground state neutron and proton densities are displayed in fig.1 ( left ) for several tin isotopes .",
    "of special importance for our investigation are the surface regions , where the formation of a skin takes place .",
    "the skin thickness is defined with the deference between neutron and proton rms radii with the equation @xmath30 and its evolution with the mass number a for the tin izotopic chain is presented in the lower panel of fig .",
    "1 ( right ) ( see also in @xcite ) . from both figures ( fig . 1 ( left ) and fig .",
    "1 ( right ) lower panel ) follow that for a@xmath31106 the neutron distribution begins to extend beyond the proton density and the effect continues to increase with the neutron excess , up to @xmath32 .",
    "thus , these nuclei have a neutron skin .",
    "the situation reverses in @xmath33 , where a tiny proton skin appears . in investigated n=50 , 82 isotones ( n@xmath34z )",
    "the presence of neutron skin was observed as well @xcite .    of special interest",
    "are the low - energy dipole excitations in tin @xcite and n=50 , 82 nuclei @xcite , which we studied in respect to their connection with skin vibrations . from qrpa calculations in @xmath35sn and n=50 , 82 nuclei",
    "we obtain a sequence of low - lying dipole states located below the neutron threshold of almost pure neutron structure .",
    "these states exhaust only a tiny fraction , less than 1% of the total thomas - reiche - kuhn ( trk ) energy weighted dipole sum rule and are related to pdr @xcite . in general the pdr states are of mixed symmetry and their total transition strength is closely related to the size of the neutron skin @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the calculated total pdr strength on the mass number in @xmath36sn nuclei is presented in comparison to @xmath37r in fig.1 ( right ) .",
    "the total pdr strength increases when @xmath37r increases and correspondingly the neutron or proton skin thicknesses increase .",
    "the analysis of the dipole transition densities acts as further indicator of pdr and provides a precise separation of the pdr states from the gdr .",
    "the calculated qrpa proton and neutron dipole transition densities for several sn isotopes and n=50 isotones ( n@xmath34z ) are presented in fig.2 . at excitation energies below the neutron emission threshold ( presented in the first column of the left and right plots of fig.2 ) we observe in - phase oscillation of protons and neutrons in the nuclear interior , while at the surface only neutrons contribute .",
    "this picture is associated with pdr mode .",
    "the states above the neutron threshold ( second and third column of the left and right plots ) indicate isovector oscillations corresponding to the excitation of the gdr .",
    "an interesting finding is the most exotic @xmath38sn nucleus where the lowest - lying 1@xmath39 state has a proton structure .",
    "it has been related to a proton pdr and investigated in details by analysis of dipole transition densities @xcite .",
    "we perform qrpa calculations of 2@xmath40 states in @xmath41sn up to excitation energies e*=35 mev . similar to the pdr we observe a sequence of states , located just above the collective 2@xmath42 and below the isgqr ( see fig.3 ( left ) ) with predominantly neutron structure .",
    "the specific admixture of isoscalar and isovector components in their phonon content is a signature of mixed symmetry states ( the amplitudes of proton and neutron state vectors are with opposite signs ) .",
    "they are connected with the ground state with small b(e2 ) transitions . by analysis of proton and neutron quadrupole transition densities ( see fig 3 ( right ) bcd ) these states can be related to neutron pqr , where neutrons from the periphery region oscillate against isospin symmetric core .",
    "in addition we can distinguish precisely the pqr states from the collective isoscalar 2@xmath43 ( fig.3 ( right)a ) and isgqr ( fig.3 ( right)e ) . in fig.3 ( right)f qrpa neutron and proton transition densities corresponding to the ivgqr are presented . from the calculation",
    "the positions of the maximums for the isgqr and ivgqr in @xmath41sn are determined , which are e*= 12.2 mev and e*= 28.1 mev , respectively .",
    "these values are close to the given ones in @xcite .    in conclusion qpm calculations in z=50 and n=50 ,",
    "82 nuclei predict low - energy dipole strength in the energy region below the particle emission threshold directly related to the size of the neutron(proton ) skin @xcite .",
    "the unique character of this mode is associated with pdr , further confirmed by the shape and structure of the transition densities clearly distinguishable from the gdr .",
    "the discussed results are in a good agreement with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "in addition quadrupole states were investigated in @xmath41sn . by analyzing their structure and proton and neutron transition densities clear separation between collective isoscalar , isovector and mixed symmetry states",
    "is achieved . a new quadrupole mode related to pqr in @xmath41sn , resembling the properties of pdr is suggested .",
