    "the standard model of galaxy formation and evolution includes hierarchical merging / clustering , where smaller structures are used as building blocks of more massive galaxies , and evolution through accretion from cosmological gas filaments in the cosmic web ( e.g. ,  combes 2004 ; dekel et al .",

    "because merger events are generally responsible for the disruption of gas and stellar aggregates , they have been traditionally associated with the triggering of supermassive black hole accretion at the center of galaxies ( active galactic nuclei activity ; springel et al .",
    "2005 ; hopkins et al . 2008 ; di",
    "matteo et al .",
    "2008 ) , and with the generation of star formation episodes ( e.g. ,  sanders et al . 1988 ; robaina et al .",
    "however , the contribution of cosmological cold - accretion flows to galaxy evolution in general , and star formation in particular , is recently gaining ground .",
    "indeed , cosmological accretion onto galaxies of external metal - poor gas is predicted by numerical simulations to be the main mode of galaxy and disk assembly , at high , and possibly also at low , redshift ( birnboim & dekel 2003 ; brooks et al .",
    "the theory predicts that these cosmological filaments are the main process by which star formation is fed and triggered at all cosmological times ( brooks et al . 2009 ; verbeke et al .",
    "cosmological gas accretion should have been more common at high redshift , but in the local universe , it is hypothesized to intervene in the evolution of individual low - mass galaxies in low - density environments , via small - scale gas streams , facilitating the arrival of gas from large distances ( kere et al . 2005 ; dekel & birnboim 2006 ; dekel et al . 2009 ; dekel , sari & ceverino 2009 ; brooks et al . 2009 ; ceverino , dekel & bournaud 2010 ; ceverino et al .",
    "2014 ; nuza et al .",
    "2014a ) .",
    "there has been some observational evidence for these accretion flows at high redshift , from the detection of inverse metallicity gradients ( lower metallicity in the central star - forming regions than in the periphery of the sources ; cresci et al .",
    "2010 ) and from high - column density absorbers ( e.g. ,  van de voort et al .",
    "however , in the local universe , there has only been indirect evidence for these events , mainly from the study of star formation in dwarf galaxies .",
    "for example , for galaxies of the same mass , the metallicity was shown to decrease when star formation increases ( mannucci et al .",
    "2010 ; lara - lpez et al .",
    "2010 ; prez - montero et al .",
    "it was also found that metallicities in quiescent blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies are higher than those of star - forming bcds ( snchez almeida 2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "more recently , observations of tadpole galaxies in the kiso survey of uv - bright galaxies ( elmegreen et al . 2013 ) and extremely metal - poor dwarf star - forming galaxies ( xmps ) , have shown that the regions where star formation occurs possess a lower metallicity than the underlying galaxy ( snchez almeida 2013 , 2014a ) . from the data",
    ", it has been shown that local bcds and xmps are generally surrounded by pools and streams of gas , over three times larger than the optical extension , which frequently display , in the peripheries , distorted and lopsided distributions and velocities ( begum & chengalur 2003 ; young et al .",

    "furthermore , significant quantities of metal - poor , large - scale gas were found in the subset of xmps ( filho et al 2013 ; hereinafter paper  i ) . because the gas in galaxy disks is diluted in a relatively small timescale ( of the order of one galaxy rotation",
    "; e.g. ,  de avillez & mac low 2002 ; yang & krumholz 2012 ) , this cumulative evidence suggests that the gas had to have been accreted recently , most likely as vestigial streams of cosmological accretion ( snchez almeida 2014b ) , like the streams modeled in high - mass galaxies ( dekel et al 2009 ; dekel , sari & ceverino 2009 ; ceverino , dekel & bournaud 2010 ; ceverino et al .",
    "the rationale is that the metallicity of the accreted gas is low .",
    "as this gas is fed to the star formation regions of the source , the overall metallicity in this region is lowered , due to dilution of the gas , while elsewhere in the galaxy , the gas has been enriched with metals from stellar winds and supernovae from previous star formation episodes .",
    "thus , xmps may constitute the ideal local laboratories to probe the role of cosmological accretion flows in galaxy evolution and star formation .",
    "xmps comprise over 0.1% of the galaxies in the local volume ( morales - luis et al .",
    "2011 ) , and represent the low - metallicity end of the most metal - poor galaxies , below an arbitrarily defined metallicity of one - tenth solar , or 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath1 7.65 .",
    "although most xmps are a subsample of star - forming bcds ( sargent & searle 1970 ; thuan & martin 1981 ; papaderos et al .",

    "they contain copious amounts of metal - poor , unsettled , gas ( begum & chengalur 2003 ; young et al .",

    "moreover , in @xmath2 80% of the cases , xmps show evidence for optical asymmetry ( papaderos et al .",
    "2008 ; morales - luis et al . 2011 ; paper  i ) .",
    "the lopsided optical morphology has been commonly interpreted as asymmetric star formation , occurring in a galaxy / disk that is in a transient phase ( papaderos et al .",

    "that is , the xmps generally show an disk - type morphology , with a velocity field typical of a rotating disk , which may present some small asymmetries and irregularities in the outskirts , and which may be ( only slightly ) offcenter relative to the optical peak and/or star - forming knots ; statistically , we do not observe significant perturbations in the large - scale gas component of the xmp population ( appendix ) .",
    "high spatial resolution observations of the gas suggest feeding of the star formation regions ; the gas is resolved into complex substructure , with the gas `` pointing at '' or `` cradling '' bright star - forming regions , or showing signs of `` clearing '' around the star - formation knots ( appendix ) .",
    "sag dig has been suggested to be the result of a merger process ( beccari et al . 2014 and appendix ) .",
    "its morphology is ring - like , with an offcenter depression , and the velocity field displays no sign of rotation .",
    "these features are generally not found in xmps , which we interpret as evidence that the xmps , as a class , are currently not undergoing a major interaction or merger .",
    "rather , the asymmetries and irregularities of the outer envelope are understood as signs of weaker interactions caused by minor mergers , gas accretion or gas outflows driven by galactic winds .",
    "in order to investigate the environment in which xmps occur , and the influence that cosmological accretion flows may have on their evolution and observed properties , we have computed the likelihood of an xmp to inhabit a certain type of environment using three diagnostics : cosmic web type , overdensity and nearest neighbours .",
    "the environment can be classified according to local indicators , such as the local density , or according to non - local indicators , based , for example , on the tidal - field tensor . in the first case",
    ", one can estimate the local overdensity based solely on observations , defined as the number density of galaxies relative to the background number density , or by characterizing the nearest neighbours ( type , mass , number and distance ) .",
    "however , a classification of the environment into its cosmic web components requires knowledge of the large - scale environment .",
    "the sign of the eigenvalues of the tidal - field tensor indicate pure contracting regions , such as clusters or knots , or expanding regions in three , two , or one dimensions , representing voids , sheets , or filaments , respectively ( hahn et al . 2007 ) .",
    "while numerical simulations provide all the necessary information to perform a cosmic web analysis , observations require a prior reconstruction of the large - scale matter density field .",
    "the particular reconstruction technique will determine the accuracy of the cosmic web classification .",
    "we here rely on precise constrained n - body simulations of the local universe , using the two - micron all - sky galaxy redshift survey ( 2mrs ; huchra et al .",

    "cosmological parameters only provide a statistical description of the universe , so that an infinite number of realizations are consistent with the same set of parameters .",
    "the procedure provides a cosmological simulation , which reproduces , in detail , the spatial distribution of galaxies in the local universe as described by 2mrs .",
    "the method to reconstruct the initial fluctuations used in these simulations is based on a self - consistent bayesian machine - learning algorithm , reaching an accuracy of @xmath0 2  mpc  @xmath9 ( kitaura et al .",

    "the environment ( overdensity or cosmic web type ) of a source can be assigned according to the cell in the reconstruction where the source is located .",

    "the nearest , least massive , and most massive potential perturbers belong to xmps in all three major cosmic web types ( voids , sheets and filaments ) .",

    "we caution , however , that due to a lack of spectroscopic redshift and the spectroscopic flux limit of the sdss , we may be missing potential perturbers of very low mass and luminosity .",
    "because the nearest galaxies to xmps are generally found to be at distances @xmath51 100  kpc ( fig .  6 and 7 ) , we have attempted to evaluate the gravitational influence these could have on the xmps , particularly if they could potentially trigger and/or feed the star formation . as a first approximation",
    ", we have analyzed the conditions for perturbation in a system of a satellite galaxy ( xmp ) on a circular orbit around a perturber .",
    "let us consider that the satellite galaxy has mass @xmath52 and radius @xmath53 , orbiting a perturber galaxy of mass @xmath54 , at a distance of @xmath55 , and where @xmath56 .",
    "minor mergers / interactions ( when @xmath56 ) occur through dynamical friction , when the perturber and satellite share a common dark matter halo .",
    "this dynamical friction causes orbital decay of the satellite galaxy within the so - called dynamical friction timescale ( e.g. ,  patton et al .",
    "2000 ; binney & tremaine 2008 ) :    @xmath57    where @xmath55 is the distance between the satellite galaxy and the perturber ( in kpc ) , @xmath58 is the circular speed of the satellite ( in km s@xmath28 ) , @xmath52 is the mass of the satellite ( in m@xmath16 ) , and ln @xmath59 is the coulomb logarithm .",
    "this expression does not take into consideration any mass loss ( from tidal stripping ) that the satellite may suffer during the orbital decay .    if we assume a typical distance to the perturber of @xmath60 100  kpc ( fig .  6 and 7 ) , a satellite mass of @xmath61 10@xmath62  m@xmath16 ( fig .  4c ) , a coulomb logarithm of 2 ( e.g. ,  binney & tremaine 2008 ; filho et al .",
    "2014 ) , and a circular velocity of the satellite of @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the gravitational constant , this then yields a dynamical friction timescale of @xmath65 50  gyr , for @xmath66 m , or 150  gyr , for @xmath67 .",
    "this estimate provides a timescale for the satellite to spiral in towards the perturber .",
    "the resulting timescales are too long for the merger / interaction process to be significant in xmps .",
    "as the satellite approaches the perturber on this orbital decay , the tidal forces at work on the satellite become more important .",
    "if we now consider a test particle at a distance @xmath68 from the surface of the satellite ( where @xmath69 ) , then the perturber will exert a perturbative tidal force on the test particle ( relative to the force exerted at the center of the satellite ) , that is given by ( e.g. ,  binney & tremaine 2008 ) :    @xmath70    the satellite will also exert a restoring force on the test particle , if tidal forces displace it from its equilibrium configuration at @xmath53 , namely , ( e.g. ,  binney & tremaine 2008 ) :    @xmath71    where we have neglected the pressure support in the satellite ( adams et al . 2011 ) . in equilibrium @xmath72 ; therefore , the displacement produced by tidal forces is given by :    @xmath73    the condition for tidal disruption of the test particle by the perturber is producing a large perturbation , i.e. , @xmath74 1 .    in figure  8",
    "we show the displacement produced by tidal forces ( eq .  4 ) , as a function of the ratio between the xmp radius and the distance to the perturber , color - coded by the relative xmp / perturber mass .",
    "as can be seen from figure  8 , in order for tidal stripping to occur , the perturber is required to have a high mass and/or be located at a small distance to the satellite . for a perturber and satellite of similar mass ( @xmath75 ) , the distance must be of the order of the size of the galaxy ( @xmath76 ) . because xmps have radii of a few kpc , @xmath55 must also be a few kpc in order to exert appreciable gravitational influence on the xmp .",

    ". the black line corresponds to @xmath77 = 1 , the lower limit criteria for tidal stripping.,width=226 ]    therefore , although a significant number of xmps show potential perturbers within @xmath37 300  mpc , it is unlikely that these will cause major gravitational disturbance ( or tidal stripping ) of the xmp , which could instigate gas transfer and sustain star formation .",
    "xmps are found to tendentiously reside in low - density environments ( @xmath0 60% ) and in cosmic web types characterized as voids and sheets ( @xmath0 75% ; sect .",

    "their behaviour is extreme , in contrast to the location in the cosmic web of e , s0 and sp galaxies , but inhabiting regions similar to those of irrs and bcds ( sect .",
    "we find results similar to those found for nearby ( relatively ) luminous galaxies ( blanton & moustakas 2009 ) and h@xmath78-emitting galaxies ( darvish et al .",
    "2014 ) , whereby the environment does not determine the overall observed properties ( mass , luminosity , sfr , etc . ) of a certain galaxy type .",
    "however , the fraction of a certain galaxy type ( in this case , xmps ) , does appear to be determined by the environment in which it resides ( sect .",
    "the evidence for occupation of low - density environments is further strengthened when we investigate the proximity to morphological filaments ( sect .",
    "3.2 ) , and galaxies in the vicinity of the xmps ( sect .",
    "we find no significant evidence for the presence of galaxy filaments within @xmath37 0.5  mpc of an xmp , and only one potential perturber ( of mass and luminosity at least equal to that of an xmp , and with a measured spectroscopic redshift in the sdss ) is found within @xmath37 100  kpc of an xmp .",
    "however , even at these distances , we have demonstrated that a potential perturber is very unlikely to cause gravitational disturbance capable of drawing fresh gas or driving the star formation ( sect .",
    "we have also analyzed the small - scale environment , probing for signatures of galaxy merger / interactions in the published data of xmps ( sect .  2 and appendix ) .",

    "moreover , it has been suggested that the properties observed in sag dig could be the result of a recent merger between dwarf galaxies ( beccari et al .",
    "2014 ) . however , if sag dig is the result of a merger ( beccari et al . 2014 ; sect .  2 and appendix ) ,",
    "then the merger signatures present in sag dig ( ring - like distribution versus disk - like optical morphology , clumpy distribution with no optical correspondence , large offset between the optical center and the depression in the distribution , no clear rotational motion ) are generally absent in the xmp population .",
    "indeed , we find no statistical evidence for ( major ) interactions with ( gas - rich ) galaxy companions in the recent past ( sect .  2 and appendix ; see also brosch , almoznino & heller 2004 , holwerda et al .",
    "2013 and kreckel et al .",
    "2015 ) , a mechanism which is traditionally invoked as a driver for star formation and overall galaxy evolution ( e.g. ,  keel et al .",
    "1985 ; robaina et al .",
    "although such an interaction could provide large quantities of fresh gas , and create conditions for triggering / feeding the observed star formation , it can not explain why the gas we observe is metal - poor ( paper  i ) , nor can it explain the metallicity inhomogeneities observed in some xmps ( snchez almeida et al .",
    "2013 , 2014a ) , and it does not explain why we do not systematically observe signatures of major disturbances / interactions in the gas , and particularly in the -to - optical morphological / kinematical relation ( sect .  2 and appendix ) .",
    "in fact , the central regions of the structures are relatively well - behaved ; in many cases they are organized in a disk with clear rotational motion , in which the kinematical axis is virtually aligned ( within 15@xmath79 ) with the and optical axis , where the peak of the emission is positionally coincident ( within 10 ) with the center of the optical disk or the brightest star formation knot ( appendix ) , and where the velocity offsets between the stellar and components are absent or small ( @xmath80 40 km s@xmath28 ; of the order of the velocity dispersion ; paper  i ) .",
    "hints of kinematical and morphological disturbance of the gas appear primarily in the galaxy outskirts ; tails , extensions , clumps of gas , and kinks , discontinuities , twisting of the velocity field ( sect .  2 and appendix ) .",
    "indeed using three different diagnostic tools ( overdensity , cosmic web type and nearest galaxies / potential perturbers ) , we find evidence that xmps are relatively isolated in the nearby universe , on scales of hundreds of kpc ( sect .  2 and 3 ) .",
    "however , despite this isolation , we must understand how xmps acquire such large amounts of metal - poor gas ( paper  i and references therein ) , and how they sustain their star formation .",
    "an alternative scenario is that xmps are truly primordial galaxies , in the sense that they have remained quiescent for some time , thus preserving the gas acquired early on in their formation .",
    "however , this scenario can not explain the current starburst phase of the xmps , nor can it explain the reason , or provide a mechanism , for the xmps to have abandoned their quiescent phase .",
    "moreover , because most xmps have huge sfrs for their stellar masses ( fig .",
    "5c ) , they would have had to form all their stars in less than a gyr , at the present rate .",
    "following snchez - almeida et al .",
    "( 2013 , 2014b ) , we find that the xmp properties , particularly their environment characteristics , are consistent with xmp evolution being mainly driven by metal - poor gas accretion , similar to the cold accretion flows simulated at high redshift ( kere et al .",
