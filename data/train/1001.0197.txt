    "the sofia pointing architecture is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : sys ] .",
    "the telescope assembly ( ta ) keeps track of its attitude using gyroscopes corrected by tracking imagers , but is unaware of sky coordinates .",
    "the science instrument ( si ) is responsible for science data acquisition .",
    "avionics provide aircraft location and attitude necessary to initialize sky coordinates .",
    "the mission communications & control system ( mccs ) correlates gyroscopes with sky coordinates and translates pointing building blocks between coordinate systems .",
    "the ta describes its attitude as a 3 degree - of - freedom ( dof ) rotation from the telescope reference frame ( tarf ) to various coordinate systems mechanically attached to the telescope .",
    "the mccs translates these to external coordinates , and accounts for the optical path .",
    "the ta is far from rigid and orthogonal ; thus many intermediate coordinate systems are established .",
    "directly - observable mccs coordinate systems are equatorial ( erf ) and grid coordinates for the three tracking imagers and the science instrument ( sirf ) .",
    "key internal coordinate systems are the telescope and inertial references ( tarf and irf ) with irf derived from a set of gyroscopes .",
    "the mccs distributes positions in all coordinates for real - time monitoring , fits headers , and archiving .",
    "the mccs uses a 2 - 3 stage approach to relate erf to irf , to @xmath0 :    1 .",
    "rough - estimate ( @xmath1 ) erf coordinates from avionics - reported aircraft position and attitude and the ta s irf and airframe attitudes .",
    "2 .   fine - tune using field recognition ( pixy ; yoshida 2000 ) on the wide field imager ( wfi ; 6@xmath2 fov ) .",
    "optionally , refine further using a 2dof correction , based upon two focal plane imager ( fpi ; 0.57pixels ) acquisitions several degrees apart .",
    "the operator monitors irf@xmath3erf with an overlay of calculated positions of stars on imagers against sky images ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : imagers ] ) , and executes the 2dof refinement when mismatch drifts too large .",
    "the ta can be pointed in any directly observable coordinate system .",
    "areas of interest ( aois ) can be defined on imagers ; the ta continually calculates aoi centroids .",
    "this provides stability feedback to the ta , necessary because gyroscopes are not sufficient to maintain pointing over hours .",
    "a centroiding aoi can be attached to a position of interest ; when activated , the ta keeps the image fixed at the desired position , by modifying irf to cancel its motions inferred from the aoi .",
    "the aoi need not coincide with the point of interest .",
    "a chop is a high - frequency square - wave oscillation of the secondary mirror ( sma ) , synchronized electronically with imager acquisition to subtract sky background . only the fpi and si observe chopped images ;",
    "other imagers do not share the optical path with the telescope . a given fpi or si pixel has two erf coordinates since any images taken are a superposition of two images with different centers ; the mccs publishes both for key positions . for pointing commands",
    ", positions can be modified by chop beam designation .",
    "the sma is commanded by a 2d center offset , amplitude , and position angle , and a coordinate system .",
    "sma state is propagated through telescope motions by keeping its specification constant in the coordinate system specified .",
    "a `` 3-point '' chop is also supported ; this includes a pause at an intermediate point ( labelled `` 0 '' ) .",
    "a nod is a low - frequency motion of the whole telescope , usually relating to an accompanying chop , to remove instrument backgrounds .",
    "nods are defined in the same manner as chops , without direct coupling , and are propagated through telescope motions identically .",
    "dithers are a generalization of nods to arbitrary - length sequences , intended to image the same star on several different imager pixels , in order to remove outliers such as cosmic ray hits or hot pixels . the first position in a dither",
    "is considered to be a `` reference , '' with all other positions defined relative to it , for relocatability on the sky .",
    "chops , nods , and dithers have no direct coupling and can therefore be mixed and matched in any combination .",
    "ta motion is significantly constrained by clearance to the airframe .",
    "thus , azimuth is mostly controlled by turning the aircraft ( gross & shuping 2009 ) .",
    "rotation against the sky can be held constant as the aircraft rotates up to @xmath4 . as this rotation nears its limit , the telescope is periodically `` rewound '' manually to a new rotation angle , between data acquisitions . during rewind ,",
    "all building blocks are held constant in the coordinate systems in which they were defined .",
    "in order to minimize development risk for the mccs , several critical design features have been included .",
    "pointing building blocks do not depend directly on each other and state derives strictly from the ta , allowing for independent development , testing , and operational use .",
    "much attention has been given to abstraction and simplification , to aid in development of testing procedures .",
    "each building block has a realistic operational `` scenario , '' defining detailed inputs , operator commands , user - visible outputs , and intermediate calculations .",
    "coordinate systems present special problems , and are notoriously difficult to orient correctly and keep that way ; to that end , regression tests include :    * diurnal rotation rate measurements with zero aircraft speed . * a `` home position '' at the equator on the vernal equinox , with northbound heading and zero speed ( enables manual calculations ) . * modifying each coordinate parameter individually .",
    "* composite tests ( verifies calculations are in the correct order ) . * corner cases ( identifies quadrant problems ) . * complete - system tests pointing to specific stars , using synthetic images .",
    "some tests violate ta physical limits ; these are evaluated against a simulator ( brggenwirth , gross , nelbach , & shuping 2009 )",
    "placing a telescope on a moving platform , while still desiring to point in absolute coordinates , presents a difficult challenge for software development . eventual success of the sofia platform in this regard depends upon careful abstraction and testing strategies for pointing the telescope ."
