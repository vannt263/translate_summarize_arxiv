    "non - perturbative qcd effects in general and the nature of the confinement mechanism in particular are theoretically challenging . at the same time",
    "these aspects are important for high energy and low energy particle and nuclear phenomenology .",
    "several models of non - perturbative qcd have been proposed whose predictions happen to differ from each other substantially in some cases .",
    "prominent examples are bag models  @xcite , strong coupling and flux tube models  @xcite , bosonic string models  @xcite , the stochastic vacuum model  @xcite , dual qcd  @xcite , the abelian higgs model  @xcite , and instanton based models  @xcite . lattice simulations of interactions between static colour sources offer an ideal environment for discriminating between different models of low energy qcd and to learn more about the confinement mechanism .",
    "they are easily accessible analytically and at the same time very accurate monte carlo predictions can be obtained  @xcite .    despite the availability of a wealth of information on fundamental potentials ,",
    "only few lattice investigations of forces between sources in higher representations of @xmath1 gauge groups exist .",
    "most of these studies have been performed in @xmath2 gauge theory in three  @xcite and four  @xcite space - time dimensions .",
    "zero temperature results for four dimensional @xmath0 can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite while determinations of polyakov line correlators in non - fundamental representation have been performed at finite temperature by bernard  @xcite for @xmath2 and in refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0 gauge theory .",
    "in our study we shall see that the so - called casimir scaling hypothesis  @xcite is rather accurately represented by the lattice data while models predicting a different behaviour are definitely ruled out .",
    "casimir scaling means that potentials between sources in different representations are proportional to each other with their ratios given by the respective ratios of the eigenvalues of the corresponding quadratic casimir operators , which is exact in the case of two dimensional yang - mills theories .",
    "our result is of particular interest with respect to recent discussions of the confinement scenario  @xcite .    at distances @xmath3  fm  @xcite non - fundamental sources",
    "will be screened and `` string breaking '' effects will be encountered that are incompatible with casimir scaling . in the present study",
    "we restrict ourselves to distances smaller than the string breaking scale @xmath4 .",
    "this article is organised as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : extract ] the lattice methods that we apply and our notations are introduced .",
    "a determination of the renormalised anisotropies and lattice spacings is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : aniso ] .",
    "the potentials are then determined in sec .",
    "[ sec : pots ] before we conclude with a brief discussion .",
    "we denote the energy of colour sources , separated by a distance @xmath5 , in a representation @xmath6 of the @xmath0 gauge group by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes some cut - off scale on the gluon momenta , for instance an inverse lattice spacing , @xmath9 .",
    "we shall also use the subscript `` @xmath10 '' to label the fundamental ( @xmath11 ) representation ( or we may just omit the subscript in this case ) .    .group theoretical factors for @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath12 is the dimension of the representation , @xmath13 are the weight factors , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 denote ratios of quadratic casimir charges . [",
    "cols=\"^,>,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have confirmed that violations of the casimir scaling hypothesis , @xmath16 are below the 5  % level for distances @xmath17  fm in the continuum limit of four dimensional @xmath0 gauge theory for all representations with @xmath18 .",
    "this finding rules out many models of non - perturbative qcd and imposes serious restrictions onto others .",
    "for instance in a bag model calculation scaling of string tensions with the square root of the respective casimir ratio has been obtained  @xcite and instanton liquid calculations result in ratios between potentials in different representations that are smaller than the casimir ratios too  @xcite .",
    "another possibility would have been scaling proportional to the number of fundamental flux tubes embedded into the higher representation vortex [ @xmath19 in @xmath0 ]  @xcite , which happens to coincide with casimir scaling in the large @xmath21 limit of @xmath1 .",
    "this picture is supported by the finding that the @xmath1 vacuum seems to act like a type i superconductor  @xcite , i.e.flux tubes repel each other . however ,",
    "this scenario is also excluded by the present study . furthermore , serious restrictions onto most of the remaining models are imposed ( see for instance ref .",
    "it is particularly disappointing that neither centre vortex models  @xcite nor the dual superconductor scenario  @xcite or string models  @xcite seem to offer any explanation why the numerical data so closely resemble the casimir ratios . certainly , it is worthwhile to dedicate more theoretical effort to this fundamental phenomenon .",
    "we have not discussed `` string breaking '' so far . while the fundamental potential in pure gauge theories linearly rises _ ad infinitum _ , the adjoint potential will be screened by gluons and , at sufficiently large distances , decay into two disjoint gluelumps  @xcite . this string",
    "breaking has indeed been confirmed in numerical studies  @xcite .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , the adjoint string tension is _",
    "zero_. in fact , all charges in higher than the fundamental representation will be at least partially screened by the background gluons .",
    "for instance , @xmath22 : in interacting with the glue , the sextet potential obtains a fundamental component . a simple rule , related to the centre of the group , is reflected in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : reps ] )  ( [ eq : reps15s ] ) : wherever @xmath23 ( zero triality ) , the source will be reduced into a singlet component at large distances while , wherever @xmath24 ( or @xmath25 ) , it will be screened , up to a residual ( anti-)triplet component , i.e.one can easily read off the asymptotic string tension ( either _ zero _ or the fundamental string tension ) from the third column of table  [ tab : reps ] , rather than having to multiply and reduce representations . as a result , the self - adjoint representations , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , as well as the representation , @xmath28 , will be completely screened while in all other representations with @xmath29 a residual fundamental component survives . the same argument , applied to @xmath2 , results in the prediction that all odd - dimensional ( bosonic ) representations are completely screened while all even - dimensional ( fermionic ) representations will tend towards the fundamental string tension at large distances .",
    "one expects this sort of string breaking and flattening of the potential to occur at distances larger than about 2.4  @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "obviously , once the string is broken casimir scaling is violated .",
    "it is certainly interesting to investigate what happens around the string breaking distance .",
    "however , this requires lattice volumes exceeding those used in the present study as well as additional operators that are designed for an optimal overlap with the respective broken string states  @xcite .",

    "the simulations were performed on the cray j90 system of the zam at forschungszentrum jlich as well as on workstations of the john von neumann institut fr computing .",
