    "prediction of entangled polymer melt flow is difficult because microscopic polymer dynamics influences the macroscopic flow behavior . to avoid the difficulties , macroscopic fluid dynamics and microscopic polymer dynamics are separately considered in conventional ways as fluid mechanics  @xcite and kinetic theory  @xcite .",
    "macroscopic fluid dynamics of entangled polymer melt is numerically solved with computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) with constitutive equation ( ce ) .",
    "ce is a time - dependent equation of stress representing elasticity and viscosity coming from microscopic polymer dynamics , but many ces are derived phenomenologically without conformation of polymer chain .",
    "then , it is difficult to apply to an arbitrary polymer melt in the framework of cfd with ce .",
    "microscopic entangled polymer dynamics is solved with molecular dynamics simulation ( md )  @xcite or coarse - grained polymer dynamics simulation ( cgpd ) with polymer chain conformations  @xcite .",
    "md or cgpd has microscopic details of polymer chains and is applicable to an arbitrary polymer melt . to describe flow dynamics of polymer melt ( larger than cubic millimeter ) in md or cgpd ( cubic nanometer ) , the number of degrees of freedom in the system becomes more than 10@xmath0 times larger than the original system .",
    "such a quite large scale simulation is impossible even in the world s highest level supercomputer which is accessible up to 10@xmath1 times scale .",
    "both macroscopic and microscopic approaches still have difficulties in dealing with entangled polymer melt flow .",
    "hierarchical approaches have been developed to compensate for the deficiencies among macroscopic fluid dynamics simulation and microscopic molecular dynamics simulation  @xcite .",
    "connfessit  @xcite has pioneered to bridge macroscopic fluid dynamics and microscopic polymeric system .",
    "this idea is extended to liquid crystals employing a different microscopic model  @xcite .",
    "these pioneering works could not include details of polymer chain conformation .",
    "rapid progress in computer technology has produced heterogeneous multiscale methods ( hmm ) which consist of cfd and md  @xcite and have succeeded to treat polymer chain conformation in a hierarchical approach .",
    "then , a lagrangian multiscale method ( lmm ) has been developed in order to manage advection of polymer chain conformation which is important for hysteresis in a general polymer melt flow  @xcite .",
    "lmm consists of lagrangian fluid particle simulation and cgpd  @xcite .",
    "a position of a lagrangian fluid particle represents center of mass of a system represented by cgpd . in a general flow field ,",
    "polymer chains in a fluid particle is deformed and oriented , and then the collective deformation and orientation are observed macroscopically  @xcite .",
    "lmm is based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method ( sph )  @xcite and each fluid particle has isotropic density distribution .",
    "when polymer chains in a fluid particle are deformed , the density distribution of polymer chains is not isotropic .",
    "this anisotropy is reflected in the normal stress and will cause inflow and outflow in eulerian cfd which uses a fixed mesh .",
    "however , the lagrangian fluid particle can not express the flow caused by the normal stress because of the isotropic density distribution of fluid particle .    to reflect the anisotropy at microscopic level to macroscopic density distribution of a fluid particle",
    ", we need to find a statistical expression of collective deformation of polymer chains .",
    "this expression should be consistent with the density distribution of a fluid particle .    in the following section , we discuss on the collective deformation of polymer chains in a flow field .",
    "then , we express an anisotropic density distribution of a fluid particle obtained from the collective deformation of polymer chains . finally , we summarize this research .",
    "in an entangled polymer melt , polymer chains are entangled each other and make a complex network structure .",
    "polymer chains in equilibrium are randomly oriented and isotropically expanded with a gyration radius @xmath2 :    [ eq.semiaxis ] @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the @xmath5-th segment vector in the @xmath6-th polymer chain in the system with @xmath7 polymer chains , @xmath8 are orthonormal basis , and the brackets @xmath9 express the average over @xmath7 polymer chains . @xmath10",
    "represent semiaxes of an ellipsoid projected onto the orthonormal basis vector @xmath11 . at equilibrium , @xmath12 ,",
    "and then we can describe an isotropic sphere .    in a flow field ,",
    "polymer chains in a complex network structure are deformed and oriented according to the flow history  @xcite .",
    "the distribution of polymer chains are not isotropic unlike an equilibrium state .",
    "however , this anisotropy can be characterized by the orthonormal basis @xmath11 .",
    "the stress tensor @xmath13 is originated in the anisotropy of the polymer chain conformations :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 represents a tension on the @xmath5-th segment vector in the @xmath6-th polymer chain @xmath16 . the eigen value @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and eigen vector @xmath19of the stress tensor @xmath13 represent the orientation degree of the polymer chains and the characteristic direction of the orientation : @xmath20 note that the eigen value @xmath17 does not represent the semiaxis @xmath21 .",
    "then , we confirm whether the semiaxes @xmath21 reflect the anisotropy of the polymer chain distribution or not , when we choose the eigen vector of the stress tensor @xmath19 as the orthonormal basis @xmath11 .",
    "we employ one of the cgpds , pasta  @xcite , to produce an equilibrium state and a non - equilibrium state of entangled polymer chains .",
    "simulation condition is as follows : number of polymer chains in a system @xmath22 , average number of entanglements @xmath23 , time step @xmath24 .",
    "unit of time @xmath25 is the relaxation time of entanglement strand .",
    "unit of length @xmath26 is the size of entanglement mesh at equilibrium .",
    "an equilibrium state is obtained after 1,000 @xmath27 $ ] at rest .",
    "a non - equilibrium state is also obtained after 1,000 @xmath27 $ ] under constant shear flow @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "figure [ fig.1 ] shows the equilibrium state ( a ) and the non - equilibrium state ( b ) . the top column in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] shows the ellipsoids obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq.semiaxis ] ) and ( [ eq.eigen ] ) , and the bottom one shows polymer chains superposed with fixing the center of mass . the sphere in fig . [ fig.1 ] ( a )",
    "are described with the following parameters obtained from polymer chain distribution : @xmath29 .",
    "because of the statistical error , the sphere is not a perfect sphere .",
    "the ellipsoid in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] ( b ) are described with the following parameters : @xmath30 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] , the obtained ellipsoid at equilibrium state is a nearly isotropic sphere , and that at non - equilibrium is anisotropic .",
    "the both ellipsoids correspond to the distribution of polymer chains .    in this section",
    ", we have discussed that the collective deformation of polymer chains is expressed with the anisotropic ellipsoids . in the next section ,",
    "we consider how to connect the ellipsoid to the density distribution of the fluid particle .",
    "the anisotropic density distribution of polymer chains , discussed in the previous section , can be reflected to the macroscopic density distribution of fluid particle . in the conventional sph",
    "@xcite , the density distribution of the @xmath5-th fluid particle @xmath31 is isotropic and is obtained as follows : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the mass of @xmath5-th fluid particle , @xmath34 is the kernel function , @xmath35 is the width of the kernel @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath36 is the normalization factor in @xmath37-dimensional space to satisfy @xmath38  @xcite . in the conventional sph",
    ", the fluid is assumed to be a newtonian fluid which is an isotropic fluid . however , the polymer melt is not isotropic as shown in the previous section .",
    "the fluid particle of polymer melt should be anisotropic according to the distribution of polymer chains .",
    "the anisotropic density distribution can be produced by the following kernel : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the ratio of semiaxis to the radius of the sphere and is a dimensionless variable .",
    "equation ( [ eq.ekernel ] ) corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ eq.kernel ] ) when @xmath41 if we assume an affinity to the density distribution of a fluid particle and the density distribution of the polymer chains in the fluid particle , @xmath42 .",
    "this assumption is reasonable because the macroscopic resolution is nearly equal to @xmath35 in this multiscale simulation and @xmath35 is much larger than the polymer chain length in the fluid particle .",
    "higher order deformation at microscopic level is ignorable in the multiscale simulation .",
    "figure [ fig.2 ] shows the density distribution of a fluid particle on @xmath43 plane , obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq.density ] ) and ( [ eq.ekernel ] ) .",
    "the mass center of fluid particle is fixed to be @xmath44 .",

    "we have considered the collective deformation of polymer chains in a flow field and derived a statistical way to describe the collective deformation by an ellipsoid .",
    "then , we have connected this microscopic anisotropy to the macroscopic fluid particle .",
    "the anisotropy of fluid particle produces heterogeneity in the density distribution and will causes a flow to recover a uniform density distribution .",
    "this flow can produce barus effect or die swell  @xcite which was not managed in the previous works  @xcite .",
