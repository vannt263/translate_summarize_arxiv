    "in a seminal paper , onsager @xcite laid down the foundations of the statistical mechanics of vortices in two - dimensional hydrodynamics .",
    "he considered the point vortex gas as an idealization of more realistic vorticity fields which appear in a rotating container filled with superfluid helium . ] and discovered that negative temperature states are possible for this system . at negative temperatures , corresponding to high energies ,",
    "like - sign vortices have the tendency to cluster into `` supervortices '' similar to the large - scale vortices ( e.g. jupiter s great red spot ) observed in the atmosphere of giant planets .",
    "the qualitative arguments of onsager were developed more quantitatively in a mean field approximation by joyce & montgomery @xcite , kida @xcite and pointin & lundgren @xcite , and by onsager himself in unpublished notes @xcite .",
    "the statistical theory predicts that the point vortex gas should relax towards an equilibrium state described by the boltzmann distribution .",
    "specifically , the equilibrium stream function is solution of a boltzmann - poisson equation . at positive temperatures ,",
    "the boltzmann - poisson equation is similar to the one appearing in the theory of electrolytes in plasma physics ( like - sign vortices `` repel '' each other ) @xcite . at negative temperatures ,",
    "it is similar to the one appearing in the statistical mechanics of stellar systems ( like - sign vortices `` attract '' each other ) @xcite .",
    "many mathematical works @xcite have shown how a proper thermodynamic limit could be rigorously defined for the point vortex gas ( in the onsager picture ) .",
    "it is shown that the mean field approximation becomes exact in the limit @xmath0 with @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of point vortices and @xmath3 their individual circulation .",
    "the kinetic theory of the point vortex gas has been developed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the statistical equilibrium state of a single species system of point vortices in an unbounded domain was studied by williamson @xcite .",
    "he used a mean field approximation and numerically solved the boltzmann - poisson equation for an axisymmetric distribution of point vortices .",
    "he empirically obtained a relation between the angular velocity , the angular momentum , the number of vortices and the temperature but did not manage to derive it .",
    "the same relation was obtained independently by lundgren & pointin @xcite who derived it from the microcanonical distribution of the point vortex gas by using essentially the same trick as the one used by salzberg & prager @xcite to obtain the exact equation of state of a 2d plasma . on the other hand , kiessling @xcite derived the williamson algebraic relation by a series of partial integrations for radial solutions of the boltzmann - poisson equation ( he proved that the solutions are necessarily radially symmetric with decreasing density profile ) .",
    "he mentioned the similarity with a virial identity obtained by corngold @xcite but also stressed that this identity is valid only at positive temperatures and corresponds to different types of averages .",
    "therefore , its application to point vortices at negative temperatures is not clear .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a simple derivation of the virial theorem of point vortices at statistical equilibrium and show that , for an unbounded system , it is equivalent to the williamson relation .",
    "our derivation is more general than previous ones since it is valid for a multispecies gas of point vortices and goes beyond the mean field approximation ( furthermore , it does not assume , or use , the fact that the flow is axisymmetric ) .",
    "therefore , the relation that we obtain is `` exact '' .",
    "we also obtain a generalization of the virial theorem for an axisymmetric system of point vortices enclosed within a disk in the mean field approximation . however , in that case , the equation is not closed ( as it involves the pressure on the boundary ) . finally , we mention numerous analogies between 2d point vortices and 2d rotating self - gravitating systems .",
    "in particular , the statistical equilibrium state , the local equation of state , the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium ( in the rotating frame ) and the virial theorem have a similar form .",
    "the virial theorem plays a very important role in the theory of simple liquids @xcite and in astrophysics @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "the `` virial of point vortices '' ( especially at negative temperatures ) has not been introduced before . in view of its importance in other domains of physics",
    ", we think that it is important to devote a specific paper to this topic .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ pv ] , we recall the basic equations of the multi - species point vortex gas in an unbounded domain . in sec .",

    "[ sec_mfa ] , we consider the mean field approximation , and derive the multi - species boltzmann - poisson equation ( from the ybg hierarchy or from a maximum entropy principle ) and the mean field virial theorem .",
    "we also consider some applications of the virial theorem for point vortices in an unbounded domain or in a disc ( for axisymmetric distributions ) .",
    "the appendices contain several additional results . in appendix [ vv ] , we define and compute the virial of point vortices . in appendix [ sec_alt ] , we provide alternative derivations of the virial theorem in an unbounded domain starting directly from the partition function or the density of states , or from the explicit analytical solution of the boltzmann - poisson equation ( for a single species system ) . in appendix",
    "[ sec_nonrig ] , we derive the virial theorem in a bounded domain for purely logarithmic potentials ( i.e. neglecting vortex images in the case of point vortices ) , and comment on the meaning of the `` pressure of point vortices '' . in appendix",
    "[ sec_yy ] , we derive the two - body correlation function and the virial theorem for a neutral spatially homogeneous system of point vortices .",
    "finally , in appendix [ er ] , we discuss the `` exact '' values of the critical inverse temperatures beyond which point vortices form dirac peaks .",
    "we consider a multi - species system of point vortices in two - dimensional hydrodynamics described by the kirchhoff - hamilton equations @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the circulation of point vortex @xmath6 . in an unbounded domain",
    ", the hamiltonian can be written @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the potential of interaction between two point vortices which satisfies the poisson equation @xmath9 .",
    "we note that the coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the point vortices are canonically conjugate . in a finite domain",
    ", this implies that their phase space is bounded ( it can not exceed @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the volume ( area ) and @xmath2 the number of point vortices ) .",
    "as first realized by onsager @xcite , this property leads to the occurrence of negative temperature states at high energies . in an unbounded domain , the effective size of the system",
    "is determined by the conservation of angular momentum ( see below ) , so that similar results are obtained .",
    "an interesting feature of the dynamics ( [ pv2])-([pv3 ] ) is that the interaction between point vortices determines the _ velocity _ of a given vortex while the interaction between material particles ( like charges or stars ) determines the _ acceleration _ ( force by unit of mass ) of a given particle .",
    "this is linked to the absence of kinetic energy ( in the usual sense ) in the hamiltonian ( [ pv2 ] ) .",
    "this is another argument why negative temperatures are possible for point vortices . for material particles , the temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy and it must be positive . in the hamiltonian of material particles , the partition function @xmath14 can be normalizable only if the inverse temperature @xmath15 is positive . since there is no kinetic part in the hamiltonian of point vortices , positive and negative temperatures are possible . ]    for an isolated system , the energy @xmath16 , the angular momentum @xmath17 and the linear impulse @xmath18 are conserved ( @xmath19 is a unit vector normal to the plane of the flow ) . of course , the total number @xmath20 of point vortices of each species is also conserved ( the total circulation of species @xmath21 is @xmath22 ) .",

    "the conservation of linear impulse @xmath41 is equivalent to the conservation of @xmath42 which is similar to the center of mass for material particles .",
