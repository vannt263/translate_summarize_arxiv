    "orion is the nearest example of a giant molecular cloud and is the site of both high - mass star formation and a prodigious number of recently - formed stars ; the central 2.5 pc region of the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) alone contains @xmath13500 stars with a combined mass exceeding 900 @xmath2 @xcite . although star - forming regions such as taurus are closer , these regions are dark clouds associated with low - mass star formation and far fewer total stars",
    ". initial star - count studies @xcite implied that up to 95% of stars formed in clustered environments like orion , while more recent _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "results indicate that at least half of all stars originate in dense regions @xcite .",
    "an analysis of binary star distributions @xcite suggests that approximately 70% of field stars may have formed in a clustered environment .",
    "thus , the study of orion , the closest giant star forming cluster , is central to investigating the early history of the majority of stars . furthermore , the variety of cluster morphologies investigated with _ spitzer _",
    "observations suggest that ob stars play a significant role in the formation and evolution of star formation in clusters @xcite .",
    "the distance to orion is a critical parameter that influences the interpretation of many of the properties of the region and its members .",
    "measurements range from @xmath1390 pc to @xmath1480 pc using a variety of methods and assumptions including observations of water masers , radio sources , an eclipsing binary , and statistical analysis ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "a closer distance would imply that the stars are less luminous , and members that are still contracting onto the main sequence are consequently older based on comparison with theoretical evolutionary tracks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "older ages for the stars above the main sequence suggest a spread in ages .",
    "binary stars yield a model - independent distance with the combination of a spatially resolved orbit and a double - lined radial velocity orbit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given the distance to orion , very high angular resolution is required to separate binary systems which exhibit significant orbital motion . the binary system @xmath0 ori c ( hd 37022 ) in the trapezium region of orion has such a close separation that it was not detected until speckle observations barely resolved the pair @xcite with a separation of less than the diffraction limit of the 6 m telescope employed in the discovery . the separation has decreased over time and is now best monitored with interferometry ; a recent orbit fit suggested the system might be just past periastron and completing an orbital cycle within a year @xcite . in this letter , we present the results of interferometric observations with npoi that add significantly to the binary orbit phase coverage and suggest the orbital period may be substantially longer than predicted .",
    "the distance to @xmath0 ori c in particular and its physical parameters such as mass and age are of great importance since the o7 primary ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as the most massive member of the onc , has the dominant role in shaping the properties of the surrounding nebula , and strongly impacts the circumstellar material around the onc stars .",
    "the photoionizing radiation from @xmath0 ori c produces the brightening of many proplyds @xcite , but also causes the material to escape .",
    "observations of mass loss rates @xcite and theoretical modeling of the results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) imply that these structures can not survive for @xmath3 yrs , substantially less than the @xmath41@xmath52 myr age of the onc @xcite .",
    "possible explanations for the apparent contradiction in disk lifetimes and stellar ages include radial orbits for the proplyds @xcite or a very young age for @xmath0 ori c , such as has been proposed for @xmath0 ori b @xcite . in contrast , recent models of the evolution of disk sizes in the onc @xcite suggest that disk survival times of 1 - 2 myr in the uv field produced by @xmath0 ori c are possible  consistent with the age of the stellar population .",
    "key to estimating the age of @xmath0 ori c is placing the secondary accurately on the h - r diagram with a well - measured distance , luminosity , and mass given that the primary has already contracted onto the main sequence .",
    "we present new magnitude differences which will aid in the assessment of the luminosity , but concentrate on the orbital motion which is required to estimate the distance .",
    "during feb . 2006 to mar .",
    "2007 , @xmath0 ori c was observed with npoi on 6 nights . the npoi array at anderson mesa near flagstaff , az , consists of six 50 cm ( 12 cm clear aperture ) siderostats which can be deployed along a y - shaped array of vacuum light pipes @xcite .",
    "the wavelength coverage spans 550@xmath5850 nm over 16 spectral channels .",
    "details regarding the npoi observational setup and data recording can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more recent upgrades relevant to this program are improvements in the acquisition camera sensitivity and calibration of the bias level for low count rates ; implementation of these two changes enabled the observations of @xmath0 ori c. table 1 provides a log of the npoi observations .",
    "the observations of @xmath0 ori c were interleaved with @xmath6 ori , one of the bright ( v=1.70 ) belt stars .",
    "the visibilities from @xmath6 ori serve to calibrate both variable atmospheric conditions and the system response to a point source .",
    "the small angular diameter of @xmath6 ori ",
    "0.86 @xmath7 0.16 milli - arcseconds ( mas ) @xcite  and its proximity to @xmath0 ori c  less than 5  separation  allowed for accurate atmospheric correction . for both the target and calibrator ,",
    "the fringes were recorded in 2 ms frames for a total scan duration of 30 s before switching to the other source .",
    "the individual 2 ms data were averaged over a 1 s time period , and these 1 s data points were checked for outliers before averaging to generate 30 s averaged @xmath8 measurements .",
    "calibration factors were determined by comparing the observed data of @xmath6 ori to that expected from a 0.86 mas diameter single star .",
    "these calibration factors were then applied to observations of @xmath0 ori c. the flagging , averaging , and calibration steps were performed with the oyster package , as described in hummel et al .",
    "( 1998 , 2003 ) , except that the bias corrections were determined for each star individually .",
    "the calibrated visibilities were fit with a model comprised of two stars with slightly resolved stellar surfaces .",
    "the primary star diameter was estimated to be 0.3 mas using the expected diameter of an o7 star at a distance of 450 pc @xcite . assuming the spectral type from @xcite , the secondary diameter was set to half that of the primary , rounded to 0.2 mas .",
    "the observational setup did not allow us to fit for such small diameters convincingly , so we held these values constant .",
    "figure 1 shows examples of calibrated @xmath9 values and the best fit model . predicted visibilities from a recent orbit solution @xcite",
    "are also plotted .",
    "table 1 lists the epoch , siderostats used , number of baselines , maximum baseline length , number of scans , estimated separation and position angle with uncertainties , and the position error ellipses . because each scan yields up to 16 @xmath9 values per baseline and up to 405 @xmath9 points",
    "were obtained during a night , individual measurements are not listed , but examples are plotted in figure 1 .",
    "model fits to individual baselines include a 180@xmath10 ambiguity in the position angle , and the values listed in table 1 are chosen based on previous measurements and the inability to fit orbits if the companion was located in the opposite quadrant in the 2007 data .",
    "some nights listed in table 1 included closure phase observations , but we defer discussion of these results , which have the ability to directly resolve the 180@xmath10 ambiguity , for a future paper including results from calibration binaries .    while the bandpass does not exactly match the @xmath11 or @xmath12 filters , our magnitude difference measured at 550 nm",
    "closely approximates that of the v band @xcite .",
    "considering all the data , the best estimates for the observed magnitude differences are @xmath13 mag@xmath14 and @xmath13 mag@xmath15 .",
    "the npoi measurement agrees with previous @xmath16 estimates from speckle observations taken at the 6.0  m special astrophysical observatory at mt .",

    "orbits based on the previous measurements and the new npoi data are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the earliest npoi data from feb .",
    "2006 show only minimal orbital motion from the iota dec .",
    "2005 data @xcite , indicating there is not an offset between the two systems .",
    "the 2007 npoi data show significant evolution in the orbit .",
    "the measured separations of the secondary relative to the primary are larger than expected from the predicted orbit and lag behind the solution in orbital phase @xcite .",
    "the npoi results indicate that a very close periastron passage did not take place this year as suggested by the preliminary orbital solutions of @xcite .",
    "as indicated in figure 2 , only part of the orbit  probably less than one half  is covered by the extant data , making any assessment of the orbit fit preliminary .",
    "combining all previous position measurements and associated error bars with the npoi visibilities and uncertainties , we fit an orbit using orbgrid @xcite and used its solution as a starting point for a least squares solution ; uncertainties from the covariance matrix of the least squares solution are quoted ( table 2 ) .",
    "both orbgrid and the least squares solution weight the astrometric points in a relative sense , and we set these weights according to the areas of the error ellipses from our table 1 and table 3 of @xcite .    we stress that the orbital elements of the best fit based on the current data ( table 2 ) may be modified substantially as more data become available . compared with the previous solution , we find a longer period and a much less eccentric orbit .",
    "our lower eccentricity of 0.16 is well within the bulk of the distribution for t tauri binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the lower mass counterparts of @xmath17 ori c. in contrast , the earlier solution found an extremely high eccentricity of 0.91@xmath50.93 ( kraus et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "although it is premature to calculate a robust distance to the orion nebula cluster from our data , if we assume a total system mass of 40  m@xmath18 the orbital elements in table  [ orbit ] give a dynamical parallax distance of 730 pc  unrealistically large considering the distance to the background high extinction molecular gas @xcite .",
    "the 40  m@xmath18 value is the minimum mass estimate from the evolutionary tracks of @xcite , using a t@xmath19 for an o7 star of 36,000  k @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath13mag@xmath20 and @xmath13mag@xmath21 between the primary and secondary stars imply at the latest a b2 secondary spectral type @xcite , with a corresponding t@xmath19 of 28,000  k. thus , 40  m@xmath18 is a lower limit ; larger masses would imply an even greater distance .",
    "figure 3 summarizes our dynamical parallax measurement .",
    "the uncertainty in the value of a@xmath22/p@xmath23 ( table  [ orbit ] ) , directly related to parallax , does not yield a reliable estimate of distance at this time . increasing the semi - major axis by 1 @xmath24 and reducing the period by 1 @xmath24 yields a low value for the distance of 344 pc for the same total mass .",
    "clearly , the available data do not significantly constrain the distance to @xmath17 ori c. figure 3 compares the best - fit semi - major axis and period , with their associated 1 @xmath24 and 2 @xmath24 error ellipses , to the values expected for the two orion distances estimated from the radio star and the maser . to explore fits to our data with more physical distances imposed",
    ", we selected a range of nine periods from 10 to 26 years and determined the corresponding semi - major axes for distances of 390  pc and 480  pc . for both distances ,",
    "fits were obtained for periods of @xmath122 years with orbital elements that agreed to within @xmath25 of the best fit elements ( table  [ orbit ] ) . fits for other periods were significantly ( by many sigma ) worse .",
    "further monitoring of the orbit of @xmath17 ori c is required to decrease the errors in the orbital elements and provide a reliable dynamical distance .",
    "given the proximity to periastron passage , continued observations are particularly important over the next months and years . resolving the distance and mass of @xmath17 ori c , and revealing the nature of its interactions with the local environment , will provide important insight into the closest region of massive star formation .",
