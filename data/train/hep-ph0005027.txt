    "we assume a common mass @xmath59 for all matter scalars and a mass @xmath60 for the higgs scalars , along with a universal gaugino mass @xmath5 , and common trilinear and bilinear ssb masses @xmath10 and @xmath61 . motivated by apparent gauge coupling unification in the mssm , @xmath0 is assumed to break directly to the gauge group @xmath62 at @xmath18 , where the reduction in rank of the gauge symmetry leads to distinct @xmath3-term contributions to scalar field mass terms .",
    "the scalar field squared masses at @xmath18 are then given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 parametrizes the magnitude of the @xmath3-terms , and can , owing to our ignorance of the gauge symmetry breaking mechanism , be taken as a free parameter , with either positive or negative values .",
    "@xmath65 is expected to be of order the weak scale .",

    "this would allow a much wider range of @xmath301 to occur@xcite .",
    "in addition , recent work on radiatively driven inverted hierarchy models has shown that `` natural '' models can be obtained with multi - tev scale scalar masses , where the third generation masses are driven to weak scale values@xcite .",
    "these models suffer the same problem with rewsb ( and possible color and charge breaking minima in the scalar potential ) as the @xmath0 model considered here .",
    "it has recently been shown that @xmath3-term contributions to scalar masses aid this class of models to acheive rewsb@xcite .",
    "finally , more complex gauge symmetry breaking patterns could occur which would affect scalar masses in alternative ways@xcite .",
