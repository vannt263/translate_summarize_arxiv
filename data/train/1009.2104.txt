    "previous studies of strings in backgrounds with compact extra - dimensions have led to an increased understanding of the formation and evolution of string loops with non - trivial windings in the internal space .",
    "both generic scenarios and compactification schemes specific to type iib string theory have been investigated @xcite-@xcite .",
    "+ in the case of static string loops , it has been shown that the presence of a lifting potential in the compact space traps the windings - giving rise to loops with step - like winding configurations referred to in the literature as cosmic necklaces @xcite-@xcite . from a four - dimensional perspective",
    "the windings appear as a series of monopoles or  beads \" connected by ordinary sections of string .",
    "superficially these resemble the standard string - monopole networks found in field - theoretic models @xcite but their behaviour is , in many ways , fundamentally different . in stark contrast to previous predictions based on field theory defects",
    ", it was found that the gravitational collapse of necklaces formed in the class of backgrounds defined by the klebanov - strassler ( ks ) geometry @xcite leads to the formation of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) @xcite during a window in the early universe , followed by the formation of potential dark matter ( dm ) relics in the scaling regime @xcite .",
    "this is almost the complete reverse of the standard predictions for string - monopole networks @xcite .",
    "+ the root cause of this difference appears to be a time - dependent bead mass in the necklace model , as opposed to the constant bead mass of true monopoles connected by strings .",
    "this arises from the time - dependence of the lifting potential and is a somewhat unexpected result .",
    "initial investigations of string necklaces assumed the existence of a constant potential and hence a constant bead mass , though these were based solely on generic arguments @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the work presented in @xcite represents the first explicit realisation of necklace formation in string theory , in which it was shown that these assumptions must be modified , at least for the class of backgrounds considered .",
    "this raises two interesting possibilities : either the formation of necklace - like objects is possible only in string theory , or there exist previously unknown solutions in field theory models which are equivalent to the objects described by strings with step - like windings .",
    "+ at present there is no known field theory analogue of necklaces formed from extra - dimensional windings . in particular , there is no known way to produce string - monopole networks with time varying bead mass .",
    "the question of whether a corresponding field theory model exists is important because , if the formation of necklace - type objects is specific to models with compact extra dimensions , their predicted impact on observable parameters could be used to obtain experimental evidence in favour of string theory , or at least in favour of higher - dimensional models .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the possibility of such a configuration .",
    "we seek to establish a relation between the topological winding number , @xmath6 , of a defect string ( in four spacetime dimensions ) and the physical winding number , @xmath7 , of an @xmath8/@xmath9-string in a higher - dimensional background .",
    "we also seek to establish a field - theoretic model in which ",
    "bead\"/pinch \" formation occurs dynamically , by analogy with the wound - string case @xcite-@xcite .",
    "+ for simplicity we consider the most basic field - theoretic model of local string formation - the abelian - higgs model .",
    "a non - cylindrical , or ",
    "pinched \" string solution - which represents generalisation of the well known nielsen - olesen vortex @xcite - naturally arises if the usual abelian - higgs action is modified to include coordinate - dependent couplings in both the scalar and vector fields ( i.e. @xmath10 and @xmath11 in our gauge choice , where @xmath12 represents the position along the length of the string ) .",
    "this appears to mimic the behaviour of the type of necklaces discussed above .",
    "+ we propose the pinched string solution as a model corresponding to wound - string necklaces , and argue that a time - dependent bead mass may be obtained .",
    "the main basis for the proposed correspondence is an analysis of the four - dimensional effective tension of the wound - strings , together with the periodically varying tension of the pinched string , which take the same form for appropriate ansatz choices . following the correspondence between string theory and field theory parameters suggested by this comparison",
    ", we propose a geometric interpretation of the field - theoretic terms , such as gauge flux and topological winding number , in the string picture .",
    "although the introduction of @xmath12-dependence in the original field couplings may appear unnatural , it has a very natural interpretation in the string picture due to the relation between the three - sphere radius @xmath13 and the string coupling @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "+ as the interchange between vortices and anti - vortices in the field - theoretic model necessarily involves the consideration of sub - planckian scales , we present a hypothetical model for discretising the planck - scale structure of the vortex . though such discretisation is necessary to prevent divergences in the euler - lagrange equations , it is not intended to be literal .",
    "whatever the exact nature of the physical limit imposed by the planck scale , it is likely to determine a limit on the process of measurement rather than implying the outright discretisation of spacetime .",
    "we adopt this method only as an approximation to an ( as yet ) unknown theory of the quantum structure of fields on the smallest scales , and present an argument for its validity ( as a toy model ) based on matching boundary solutions of planck - sized regions to well known solutions valid on scales @xmath16 . once again , we find that the localisation of the ( classical ) field - theoretic string core on scales @xmath17 admits a very natural interpretation in terms of the quantum constraints on the corresponding wound @xmath8/@xmath9-strings . + the structure of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we present a brief overview of the abelian - higgs model , including the general ( covariant ) form of the euler - lagrange equations . for completeness , and to allow easy comparison with later calculations of the @xmath12-dependent tension of the pinched string @xmath18 , an outline of the calculation of the constant string tension @xmath19 for the cylindrically symmetric ansatz is reviewed in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we introduce a non - cylindrically symmetric ansatz based on a specific discretisation scheme in the planck - scale region of the vortex core ( in which vorticity itself may no longer be defined ) , and introduce the @xmath12-dependent couplings @xmath10 and @xmath11 . from this",
    "we derive the specific form of the equations of motion ( eom ) to verify that the pinched string configuration is a valid solution . under a set of reasonable assumptions ,",
    "these are found to reduce to simplified forms which ( for fixed @xmath12 ) are structurally equivalent to the eom for the cylindrically symmetric case .",
    "this allows analogous asymptotic and small @xmath20 solutions for the scalar and gauge fields but their behaviour is now , generally , @xmath12-dependent .",
    "we show that the @xmath12-dependent tension depends crucially on the form of a generic , dimensionless , periodic function @xmath21 which varies between zero and one but which , to good approximation , is independent of the physics of the vortices in the planck - scale regions .",
    "we then discuss the effective four - dimensional tension of an @xmath8/@xmath9-string with linear winding ansatz at the tip of the ks throat , and compare with the results for our pinched string . for an appropriate and natural choice of @xmath21",
    "we see that this enables a correspondence between the field theory and the string theory parameters to be inferred .",
    "this section also contains a more detailed analysis of the relation between the scalar and vector fields in the higgs model , and their geometric interpretation in the theory of wound strings .",
    "using the @xmath22 metric convention , and introducing the covariant derivative @xmath23 ( together with its conjugate ) , the covariant form of the abelian - higgs action is @xcite @xmath24 varying this action with respect to the various fields yields the resultant eom , assuming that the gauge field and scalar derivatives vanish at the boundary , @xmath25 with the corresponding maxwell equation now taking the form @xmath26 the @xmath27 current is @xmath28 the static , cylindrically symmetric ansatz then takes the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 are dimensionless variables and @xmath31 are the length scales of the scalar and vector cores , respectively .",

    "this allows us to define both the scalar and vector eom in terms of the dimensionless variables @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "+ although multiplying the original form of our equations by powers of @xmath20 may be hazardous in the asymptotic limit , multiplying the vector eom through by a factor of @xmath44 causes no problems for @xmath45 as each term in the equation still goes to zero independently as @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "+ however , defining the parameter @xmath48 we can rewrite the scalar equation as @xmath49 treating the ratio @xmath50 as a numerical constant then allows us to rewrite both the scalar and vector eom in terms of a single dimensionless variable @xmath43 , and adopting the form ( [ eq : scs_eom1_mod ] ) for the scalar eom is equivalent to assuming @xmath51 instead of @xmath52 in the ansatz ( [ eq : scs_ansatz1 ] ) .",
    "this may appear counter - intuitive because we expect the length scale @xmath53 to determine the width of the scalar core ( i.e. the region over which @xmath54 ) .",
    "however , the fact that ( [ eq : scs_eom1 ] ) and ( [ eq : scs_eom1_mod ] ) are algebraically equivalent shows that we may assume either functional form for @xmath55 in our initial ansatz .",
    "both equations have the same approximate solutions in the asymptotic and small @xmath20 limits and it is the value of @xmath53 which characterises the small @xmath20 solution , though both scales @xmath53 and @xmath56 play a role in the asymptotics ( at least when the eom are solved as a coupled pair @xcite ) .",

    "the key points are that the leading order contribution at critical coupling is proportional to @xmath32 , which agrees with the expected result , and that at non - critical coupling the tension is logarithmically dependent on @xmath50 .",
    "note that the inclusion of the factor of @xmath91 in the expression for @xmath56 ensures the first of these conditions and this , in turn , ensures the stability of the vortex according to the famous result by bogomolnyi @xcite ( c.f .",

    "+ in the following section we introduce a non - cylindrically symmetric ansatz for the pinched string and solve the resulting eom .",

    "in other words , the structure of the vortices remains essentially the same except that the radii of the scalar and vector cores become functions of their position along the string . therefore the calculation of the tension ( for fixed @xmath12 ) remains the same as that outlined above , apart from the introduction of a new radial magnetic flux term @xmath94 ( associated with the @xmath12-dependent variation of @xmath95 ) and of a new @xmath12-derivative component in the scalar gradient which give rise to an additional periodic term .",
    "although the resulting tension @xmath18 is periodic in @xmath12 , it still carries a leading order constant term @xmath96 , derived in an analogous way to that in ( [ eq : convenient_mu1 ] ) , which may be identified with a similar leading order constant term @xmath97 in the expression for the effective four - dimensional tension of a wound @xmath98-string . additionally , by analogy with @xmath99 , we may define the parameter @xmath100 .",

    "the identification proposed above appears natural since we expect the parameters which control inflation to set the present day mass - scale of the universe .",
    "+ there are two important remarks to make about the above analysis .",
    "the first regards the nature of the symmetry - breaking phase transition in the string picture . in the abelian - higgs model",
    "the phase transition , giving rise to string formation , is well - defined and it is the @xmath27 symmetry of the vacuum that is broken .",
    "however such symmetry - breaking should be dynamic , and moreover the coupling constants are tuned by hand . according to our argument",
    ", we can equate the parameters determining the size and shape of the mexican hat potential with their string analogues .",
    "but how are we to interpret the symmetry - breaking on the string side ?",
    "we imagine a long , straight ( i.e. unwound ) @xmath98-string obeys @xmath27 symmetry with respect to rotation around its central axis . when windings form this symmetry is broken and each point along the string adopts a  phase \" factor , determined by it s position in a @xmath488 sub - manifold of the full three - sphere . in the string picture the dynamic nature of the symmetry - breaking process in therefore manifest , and helps us understand why we may write all the parameters which define the field - theoretic strings ( including @xmath32 ) in terms of parameters controlling the @xmath8/@xmath9-string dynamics , and in particular those which control the process of winding formation ( regardless of the exact model of winding formation we adopt ) .",
    "+ the second remark concerns cosmic necklaces , first proposed by matsuda as possible dm candidates @xcite .",
    "the idea was that necklaces which had shrunk to their minimal size ( determined by the fundamental string thickness ) and which contained insufficient mass to undergo collapse , would only interact with other fields / matter gravitationally .",
    "the proposed correspondence between necklace configurations and pinched gauge strings now suggests that this is unlikely to occur , since the presence of a dual @xmath95 term implies that necklaces may also interact with the gauge field . with this in mind",
    ", we propose the following definitions for the effective scalar and vector fields in the wound string model , @xmath489 and @xmath490 where , @xmath200 are subject to boundary conditions analogous to those imposed before . here",
    "@xmath160 may also be interpreted as the angular coordinate of a point on the @xmath491 sub - manifold that defines the effective radius of the winding ( for any value of @xmath12 ) , and @xmath20 is the distance from the  centre \" of the @xmath491 to its circumference .",
    "physically , a section of wound string effectively occupies a volume @xmath492 in the large dimensions such that @xmath20 and @xmath160 also admit their usual interpretations of the radial and angular coordinates for a string of finite width .",
    "this gives rise to a flux at each point along the string which is quantised in terms of @xmath493 in the string picture ( for fixed values of the other parameters ) and in terms of @xmath396 in the field picture @xmath494      we now use physical arguments to construct dynamic models of pinch formation , which are the direct analogue of dynamical winding formation in the random walk and velocity correlations regimes . to construct the analogue of the former ; consider a field configuration corresponding to an @xmath495-vortex string undergoing random quantum fluctuations in both its phase @xmath160 and magnitude @xmath496 at every point on the string . in order for a section of string within the horizon to undergo a spontaneous transition to a new topological state @xmath497",
    ", the fluctuations in @xmath160 would need to be perfectly correlated over some distance @xmath498 ( i.e. within a volume of approximately @xmath499 ) . for example , a transition from a @xmath118 state to a @xmath119 state , at even a single position @xmath12 corresponds to degenerate vacuum states @xmath500 ( @xmath501 ) tunnelling through the mexican hat potential so that @xmath502 .",
    "this is highly unlikely , regardless of the tunnelling amplitude for such a transition at any individual point .",
    "+ it is also possible for random fluctuations in the magnitude @xmath503 at each point to result in a total reduction of the vortex size to sub - planckian scale .",
    "if this were to occur within the horizon it would be necessary for such fluctuations to be correlated , at least over some length scale @xmath498 , in order for a finite section of string to re - emerge with a different topological winding number . even if this continuously occurs over small regions ( which would be the analogue of continuous brownian motion at every point along a wound string )",
    ", it is clear that the net effect would be to to leave the macroscopic structure of the string , and the total number of pinches , unchanged .",
    "+ the situation is different , however , for the vortex slice which lies ( instantaneously ) on the horizon . in this case",
    "the vortex is free to re - emerge in a differing topological state so that only fluctuations at the horizon may contribute to the net number of pinches .",
    "let us assume that the edge of the vortex at the horizon moves with velocity @xmath504 , but randomly increases or decreases , so that its net velocity may be estimated via @xmath505 where @xmath506 denotes the number of pinches and we have again assumed critical coupling . making the transition to warped space so that @xmath507 and using @xmath508 , the expression for @xmath509 is equivalent to that for @xmath438 : @xmath510 the number of pinches per loop , for a loop formed at @xmath511 is then @xmath512 where @xmath513 is again the step length . setting @xmath514",
    "then results in expressions for @xmath515 , @xmath516 and @xmath517 in the field picture which are the exact analogues of those for @xmath518 , @xmath519 and @xmath520 in the string picture , namely , @xmath521 where we have also identified @xmath522 and @xmath523 and where we have also made the substitution @xmath524 where necessary when transfering between warped and unwarped space .",
    "one may check that under these identifications @xmath525 as @xmath526 , @xmath527 .",
    "though differing from our previous result @xmath528 this is to be expected for windings formed via a random walk where the proportion of the total string length contained in the extra - dimensional windings tends to zero as @xmath526 .",
    "importantly we can now predict the vorticity of the field theoretic strings , in terms of the velocity associated with the fluctuations at the horizon ( or equivalently in terms of the observed number of pinches ) .",
    "if a suitable quantum theory of vortices is developed , it may be possible to predict both @xmath32 and @xmath125 ( or @xmath506 ) in terms of the underlying dynamics .",
    "as a first step towards this goal , note that in the scaling regime , @xmath529 was used to identify @xmath530 , yielding @xmath531 @xcite .",
    "however , we have now constructed a more explicit correspondence between a wound string model in warped space and a defect string in unwarped space which further allows us to identify @xmath532 the physical constraints @xmath533 and @xmath57 , @xmath534 then imply @xmath535 which in conjunction with ( [ eq : izzy ] ) yield @xmath536 , though this is perfectly consistent with the sugra approximation @xmath537 for @xmath538 .",
    "recall that the total mass of a pinched string loop is @xmath539 which , for the ansatz ( [ eq : g_ansatz ] ) , may in turn may be approximated by @xmath540 although further investigation is needed , we content ourselves here with demonstrating an order of magnitude equivalence between the pinched string bead mass and the wound string bead mass . in terms of field - theoretic parameters ,",
    "the bead mass is then @xmath541 where we have used the fact that the mass of an individual bead is half that associated with a single pinch .",
    "we then make use of the recently established identities @xmath542 , @xmath543 , @xmath544 , @xmath545 and @xmath546 to obtain @xmath547 using @xmath548 we then find @xmath549 which is in turn equivalent to , @xmath550 for @xmath528 .",
    "this result is identical to that obtained in @xcite for the mass of a wound - string bead in which the windings were formed via a random walk regime .",
    "however , as mentioned previously , in this case we expect that @xmath551 , rather than @xmath552 ( which we expect to associate with windings formed in a velocity correlations regime ) , which would instead yield @xmath553 there therefore remains a slight inconsistency between the result presented here and those obtained in the previous paper , though it may be hoped that further analysis may be able to clarify this point .",
    "the most important result is that , in either case ( i.e. whether the field - theory expression ( [ eq : bazinga ] ) leads to ( [ eq : omg ] ) or ( [ eq : omg2 ] ) in the string picture ) , the late time fall - off of @xmath554 is proportional to @xmath555 , and the behaviour of pinched string networks may closely mimic that of necklaces formed from wound strings .",
    "+ additionally , we may hope to use the dual pinched string model to answer the question : does bead mass remain fixed after the time of loop formation @xmath556 ? unfortunately , in the absence of a full dynamical model of pinch evolution , we are still unable to answer this question with any certainty .",
    "as the bead mass in this model depends on the quantity @xmath557 we see that two competing factors come into play - the time evolution of @xmath558 in an explicitly dynamic model ) and that of the gradient term @xmath375 . in principle",
    "it is possible for either factor to outweigh the other , so that the bead mass could even increase !",
    "this too may have an analogue in the string picture , whereby the contraction of the string causes neighbouring windings to move closer together , increasing their effective radii .",
    "much more work is needed in both the string and field theory models in order to develop a full dynamical theory .",
    "+ finally , we make a physical observation regarding the construction of a model of pinch formation that is analogous to winding production in the velocity correlations regime . in this case",
    "we assume that the edge of the vortex at the horizon has a classical velocity causing the string core to shrink to the planck scale before growing again to its maximum radius ( reversing direction ) .",
    "dynamically it is unclear why this should be so , but an alternate view of this scenario is that the defect string formed ready - pinched at the epoch of the symmetry - breaking phase transition , so that successive pinches ( separated by a characteristic length scale @xmath125 ) are then simply uncovered by the advancing horizon at a rate proportional to @xmath302 .",
    "we have obtained static vortex solutions to a modified abelian - higgs model which describe non - cylindrical strings by introducing spatially - dependent couplings . hypothesising the existence of planck - sized regions in which vorticity becomes undefined , it was also possible to construct a model in which neighbouring sections of string carry different topological charges . assuming a periodic variation in the pinched string profile , a formal correspondence between the resulting periodic tension and the effective four - dimensional tension of a wound @xmath8/@xmath9-string in the ks geometry was obtained . using a specific , but natural , ansatz choice for the string embedding describing non - geodesic windings",
    ", we were able to obtain specific identities between string theory parameters ( defining the ks geometry ) and the field theory parameters ( defining the abelian - higgs model ) . in the dual string picture ,",
    "the spatial dependence of the field couplings were found to be related to the effective radius of the windings .",
    "+ one interesting observation about this matching is that the field theory result is at large @xmath32 ( i.e. large winding number ) , whilst the @xmath451-string tension has large flux @xcite .",
    "more concretely the matching on the field theory side was through the parameter pairing @xmath559 , with @xmath560 on the string theory side , which suggests a relation between the symmetry breaking scale ( set by @xmath456 ) and the string length .",
    "+ though there are many possible ways in which to improve and build upon this work , the most valuable would be to extend the present analysis from the purely static case to the more general dynamical one .",
    "ideally complete dynamical models of pinched string formation ( and pinch evolution ) would be developed which would allow us to determine the cosmological consequences of pinched string networks with greater accuracy .",
    "it would also be instructive to compare these with general dynamical models of wound @xmath451-strings in order to determine if correspondences exist for more general string backgrounds .",
    "a simple example would be the inclusion of fluxes present in the warped deformed conifold solution , but analysis in more general backgrounds would be most likely to lead to a better understanding of the field - string correspondence .",
    "moreover we have only considered models of string necklaces in this paper , and the extension to more general string lattice configurations ( where each bead is attached to @xmath561 strings ) remains to be developed @xcite there is significant scope for future work , including the matching of such models to the cmb anisotropy data and evaluating the projected gravitational wave spectrum .",
