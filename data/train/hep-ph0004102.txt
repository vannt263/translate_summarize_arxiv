    "the origin of grbs , bursts of 0.1 mev1 mev photons lasting for a few seconds , remained unknown for over 20 years , primarily because grbs were not detected prior to 1997 at wave - bands other than @xmath2-rays @xcite .",
    "the isotropic distribution of bursts over the sky suggested that grb sources lie at cosmological distances , and general phenomenological considerations were used to argue that the bursts are produced by the dissipation of the kinetic energy of a relativistic expanding fireball ( see [ 2 ] for review ) .    adopting the cosmological fireball hypothesis ,",
    "it was shown that the physical conditions in the fireball dissipation region allow fermi acceleration of protons to energy @xmath3 @xcite , and that the average rate at which energy is emitted as @xmath2-rays by grbs is comparable to the energy generation rate of uhecrs in a model where uhecrs are produced by a cosmological distribution of sources @xcite .",
    "based on these two facts , it was suggested that grbs and uhecrs have a common origin ( see [ 5 ] for a recent review ) .    in the last two years , afterglows of grbs",
    "have been discovered in x - ray , optical , and radio wave bands @xcite .",
    "afterglow observations confirmed the cosmological origin of the bursts , through the redshift determination of several grb host - galaxies , and confirmed standard model predictions of afterglows that result from the collision of an expanding fireball with its surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "these observations therefore provide strong support for the grb model of uhecr production .    in this review , uhecr and neutrino production in grbs",
    "is discussed in the light of recent grb and uhecr observations .",
    "the fireball model is briefly described in  2.1 , and proton acceleration in grb fireballs is discussed in  2.2 .",
    "implications of recent afterglow observations to high energy particle production are discussed in  3 .",
    "model predictions are shown to be consistent with the observed uhecr spectrum in  4 .",
    "predictions of the grb model for uhecr production , that can be tested with future uhecr experiments , are discussed in  5 .",
    "high energy neutrino production in fireballs and its implications for future high energy neutrino detectors are discussed in  6 .",
    "in the fireball model of grbs , a compact source , of linear scale @xmath4  cm , produces a wind characterized by an average luminosity @xmath5 and mass loss rate @xmath6 . at small radius ,",
    "the wind bulk lorentz factor , @xmath7 , grows linearly with radius , until most of the wind energy is converted to kinetic energy and @xmath7 saturates at @xmath8 .",
    "variability of the source on time scale @xmath9  ms , resulting in fluctuations in the wind bulk lorentz factor @xmath7 on similar time scale , lead to internal shocks in the expanding fireball at a radius @xmath10 .",
    "these shocks reconvert part of the kinetic energy to internal energy , which is then radiated as @xmath2-rays by synchrotron emission of shock - accelerated electrons .",
    "the @xmath2-ray flux is observed to vary on time scale @xmath11 .",
    "as the fireball expands , it drives a relativistic shock ( blast wave ) into the surrounding gas . at a radius @xmath12 , where @xmath13  s is the wind duration , most of the fireball energy is transferred to the surrounding gas , and the flow approaches self - similar expansion .",
    "the shock driven into the ambient medium at this stage continuously heats new gas , and accelerates relativistic electrons that produce by synchrotron emission the delayed radiation , `` afterglow , '' observed on time scales of days to months . as the shock - wave decelerates , the emission shifts with time to lower frequency .",
    "the observed grb and afterglow radiation is produced by synchrotron emission of shock accelerated electrons . in the region where electrons are accelerated , protons are also expected to be shock accelerated .",
    "this is similar to what is thought to occur in supernovae remnant shocks @xcite .",
    "internal shocks are generally expected to be `` mildly '' relativistic in the fireball rest frame , i.e. characterized by lorentz factor @xmath14 , since adjacent shells within the wind are expected to expand with lorentz factors which do not differ by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "we therefore expect results related to particle acceleration in sub - relativistic shocks @xcite to be valid for the present scenario .",
    "in particular , the predicted energy distribution of accelerated protons is @xmath15 .",
    "two constraints must be satisfied by fireball wind parameters in order to allow proton acceleration to @xmath16  ev in internal shocks @xcite : @xmath17 in order for the proton acceleration time @xmath18 to be smaller than the wind expansion time , and @xmath19 in order for the synchrotron energy loss time of the proton to be larger than @xmath18 . here , @xmath20 , @xmath21  ms , @xmath22  ev , @xmath23 is the @xmath2-ray luminosity , @xmath24 is the fraction of the wind energy density which is carried by magnetic field , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the fraction of wind energy carried by shock accelerated electrons .",
    "( [ eq : xi_b ] ) and ( [ eq : g_min ] ) imply that protons may be accelerated in a grb wind to energy @xmath27  ev , provided that @xmath28 and that the magnetic field is close to equipartition with electrons .",
    "the former condition , @xmath28 , is remarkably similar to that inferred based on @xmath2-ray spectra .",
    "there is no theory at present that allows a basic principles calculation of the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "however , magnetic field close to equipartition , @xmath29 , is required in order to account for the observed @xmath2-ray emission .",
    "we have assumed in the discussion so far that the fireball is spherically symmetric . however , since a jet - like fireball behaves as if it were a conical section of a spherical fireball as long as the jet opening angle is larger than @xmath30 , our results apply also for a jet - like fireball ( we are interested only in processes that occur when the wind is ultra - relativistic , @xmath31 , prior to significant fireball deceleration ) . for a jet - like wind , @xmath32 in our equations",
    "should be understood as the luminosity the fireball would have carried had it been spherically symmetric .",
    "in addition to providing support to the validity of the qualitative fireball scenario described in  2.1 , afterglow observations provide quantitative constraints on fireball model parameters .",
    "the determination of grb redshifts implies that the characteristic grb @xmath2-ray luminosity and emitted energy are @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively , an order of magnitude higher than the values assumed prior to afterglow detection .",
    "afterglow observations also indicate that @xmath35 .",
    "this suggests that the constraint ( [ eq : xi_b ] ) is indeed satisfied , allowing proton acceleration to @xmath27  ev .",
    "the observed grb redshift distribution implies a grb rate of @xmath36 at @xmath37 .",
    "the present , @xmath38 , rate is less well constrained , since most observed grbs originate at redshifts @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "present data are consistent @xcite with both no evolution of grb rate with redshift , and with strong evolution ( following , e.g. , the luminosity density evolution of qsos or the evolution of star formation rate ) , in which @xmath40 . the energy observed in @xmath2-rays reflect the fireball energy in accelerated electrons .",
    "if shock accelerated protons and electrons carry similar energy , as indicated by afterglow observations , then the @xmath38 rate of cosmic - ray production by grbs is similar to the generation rate of @xmath2-ray energy , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is in the range of @xmath43 to @xmath44 .",
    "in fig . 1 we compare the uhecr spectrum , reported by the fly s eye @xcite , the yakutsk @xcite , and the agasa @xcite experiments , with that predicted by the grb model .    the flattening of the cosmic - ray spectrum at @xmath45  ev , combined with the lack of anisotropy and the evidence for a change in composition from heavy nuclei at low energy to light nuclei ( protons ) at high energy @xcite , suggest that an extra - galactic source of protons dominates the flux at @xmath46  ev .",
    "the uhecr flux predicted by the grb model is in remarkable agreement with the observed extra - galactic flux .",
    "the suppression of model flux above @xmath47  ev is due to energy loss of high energy protons in interaction with the microwave background , i.e. to the `` gzk cutoff '' @xcite .",
    "both fly s eye and yakutsk data show a deficit in the number of events , consistent with the predicted suppression .",
    "the deficit is , however , only at a @xmath48 confidence level @xcite .",
    "the agasa data is consistent with fly s eye and yakutsk results below @xmath49  ev .",
    "a discrepancy may be emerging at higher energy , @xmath27  ev , where the fly s eye and yakutsk experiments detect 1 event each , and the agasa experiment detects 6 events for similar exposure .",
    "the flux above @xmath50 is dominated by sources at distances @xmath51 . since the distribution of known astrophysical systems ( e.g. galaxies , clusters of galaxies ) is inhomogeneous on scales of tens of mpc , significant deviations from model predictions presented in fig .",
    "1 for a uniform source distribution are expected above @xmath50 .",
    "clustering of cosmic - ray sources leads @xcite to a standard deviation , @xmath52 , in the expected number , @xmath53 , of events above @xmath49 ev , given by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the unknown scale length of the source correlation function and @xmath56 mpc for field galaxies .",
    "an order of magnitude increase in the exposure of uhecr experiments , compared to that available at present , is required to test for the existence of the gzk cutoff .",
    "such exposure would allow this test through an accurate determination of the spectrum in the energy range of @xmath47  ev to @xmath49  ev , where the effects of source inhomogeneities are expected to be small @xcite .",
    "moreover , an order of magnitude increase in exposure will also allow to determine the source correlation length @xmath55 , through the detection of anisotropies in the arrival directions of @xmath57  ev cosmic - rays over angular scales of @xmath58  mpc @xcite .",
    "the rate at which grbs occur within a distance of @xmath59  mpc from earth , the distance to which @xmath27  ev proton propagation is limited due to interaction with the microwave background , is @xmath43 per 100  yr .",
    "this rate can be reconciled with the detection of several @xmath27  ev events over a period of a few years only if there is a large dispersion , @xmath60 , in the arrival time of protons produced in a single burst .",
    "the required dispersion is likely to result from deflection by random magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "a proton of energy @xmath61 propagating over a distance @xmath62 through a magnetic field of strength @xmath63 and correlation length @xmath64 is deflected by an angle @xmath65 , which results in a time delay , compared to propagation along a straight line , @xmath66 . the random energy loss suffered by @xmath3 protons as they propagate , owing to the production of pions , implies that protons observed at earth with given energy have different energy histories along their propagation path .",
    "thus , magnetic field deflection results not only in a delay , but also in a spread in arrival time of protons of fixed energy , comparable to the delay @xmath67 .",
    "the current upper bound on the inter - galactic magnetic field @xcite , @xmath68 , allows a spread @xmath69  yr , well above the minimum , @xmath70  yr , required in the model . the magnetic field upper bound implies an upper bound on the number of grbs contributing to the @xmath27  ev flux at any given time , @xmath71 .",
    "the upper bound on the number of sources contributing to the flux above @xmath61 decreases rapidly as @xmath61 increases beyond @xmath49  ev , as the propagation distance decreases with energy due to the increase in pion production energy loss rate .",
    "this rapid decrease implies that at @xmath72  ev there can be only a few sources contributing to the flux at any given time @xcite .",
    "the grb model therefore makes a unique prediction @xcite : the uhecr flux at energy @xmath73  ev should be dominated by a few sources on the sky .",
    "these sources should have narrowly peaked energy spectra , and the brightest sources should be different at different energies .",
    "this is due to the fact that at any fixed time a given burst is observed in uhecrs only over a narrow range of energy : if a burst is currently observed at some energy @xmath61 then uhecrs of much lower ( higher ) energy from this burst will arrive ( have arrived ) mainly in the future ( past ) .",
    "testing the grb model predictions requires an exposure 10 times larger than that of present experiments .",
    "such increase is expected to be provided by the planned auger @xcite detectors .",
    "protons accelerated in the fireball to high energy lose energy through photo - pion production in interaction with fireball photons .",
    "the decay of charged pions results in the production of high energy neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the observed energy of a proton , for which the observed 1  mev photons are at the threshold of the @xmath75-resonance , is @xmath76  mev .",
    "typically , the neutrino receives @xmath77 of the proton energy .",
    "thus , the typical energy of neutrinos resulting from interaction of accelerated protons with grb photons is@xmath78    the flux normalization is determined by the efficiency of pion production .",
    "the fraction of energy lost to pion production by protons producing the neutrino flux above @xmath79 is essentially independent of energy and is given by @xcite @xmath80 if grbs are the sources of uhecrs , then using eq .",
    "( [ fpi ] ) and and eq . ( [ eq : cr_rate ] ) with @xmath81 , the expected grb neutrino flux is @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 stands for @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .    the flux of @xmath1  ev neutrinos given in eq .",
    "( [ jgrb ] ) implies that large area , @xmath87 , high - energy neutrino telescopes , which are being constructed to detect cosmologically distant neutrino sources @xcite , would observe several tens of events per year correlated in time and in arrival direction with grbs .",
    "detection of neutrinos from grbs could be used to test the simultaneity of neutrino and photon arrival to an accuracy of @xmath88 ( @xmath89 for short bursts ) , checking the assumption of special relativity that photons and neutrinos have the same limiting speed to one part in @xmath90 , and the weak equivalence principle , according to which photons and neutrinos should suffer the same time delay as they pass through a gravitational potential , to one part in @xmath91 ( considering the galactic potential alone ) .",
    "the model discussed above predicts the production of high energy muon and electron neutrinos .",
    "however , if the atmospheric neutrino anomaly has the explanation it is usually given , oscillation to @xmath92 s with mass @xmath93 @xcite , then one should detect equal numbers of @xmath84 s and @xmath92 s .",
    "up - going @xmath67 s , rather than @xmath94 s , would be a distinctive signature of such oscillations . since @xmath92 s",
    "are not expected to be produced in the fireball , looking for @xmath67 s would be an `` appearance experiment . '' to allow flavor change , the difference in squared neutrino masses , @xmath95 , should exceed a minimum value proportional to the ratio of source distance and neutrino energy . a burst at @xmath96 producing @xmath97 neutrinos can test for @xmath98 , 5 orders of magnitude more sensitive than solar neutrinos .",
