    "this paper is concerned with developing a finite difference scheme to simulate the so - called mild solution to a particular hyperbolic stochastic partial differential equation .",
    "our motivation for considering this scheme is to explore alternative methods to simulate so - called volatility modulated volterra ( vmv ) processes ( for definition , see ( [ def : genxvolt ] ) ) .",
    "volatility modulated volterra processes can be simulated by means of numerical integration , but due to the integrands depending on the time parameter , numerical integration is cumbersome since at each time step one needs to perform a complete re - integration .",
    "thus , we propose an alternative method to simulate these volatility modulated volterra processes , as the boundary solution of a hyperbolic stochastic partial differential equation .",
    "we note that a special type of volatility modulated volterra processes are so - called lvy semistationary ( lss ) processes , which are processes that are stationary under a stationarity assumption on the volatility process .",
    "these processes have recently been proposed in the framework of modelling electricity and commodity prices , see barndorff - nielsen , benth and veraart @xcite , although they were initially employed as modelling tools for turbulence and tumor growth .",
    "it has been pointed out that the class of lvy semistationary processes can indeed catch many of the stylised features , such as spikes and mean - reversion , that have been observed in electricity and commodity markets .",
    "the mean reversion of lvy semistationary processes is in probability , and the high spikes are facilitated by the volatility process and jumps in the driving lvy process .",
    "thus , it is highly relevant in the energy setting to have an effective simulating algorithm for derivative pricing purposes .",
    "employing the finite difference scheme to simulate volatility modulated volterra processes as opposed to numerical integration has the following advantages .",
    "as we have already noted we obtain the volatility modulated volterra process as the boundary solution of the stochastic partial differential equation , but in order to obtain a full trajectory of the boundary with the finite difference scheme we need to numerically solve the stochastic partial differential equation on a triangular grid .",
    "therefore when simulating our trajectory , we get the solution of the stochastic partial differential equation for free on the triangular grid . in order to simulate a value in a particular point @xmath0 in the grid ,",
    "we need to know the values at the previous time step @xmath1 as well as at the spatial step above @xmath2 . given initial and boundary conditions we may even solve the stochastic partial differential equation recursively on a rectangular grid .",
    "we shall show that under certain conditions , the finite difference scheme converges to the corresponding mild solution .",
    "moreover , given a stochastic partial differential equation and a discretization we give a recipe for quantifying the error of the finite difference scheme in @xmath3 .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ lss ] , we start by introducing volatility modulated volterra processes and discussing some preliminary results on them which we shall refer to later in the paper . while in section  [ lss : hspde ] , we proceed to introduce our hyperbolic stochastic partial differential equation , its mild solution and how we can obtain the volatility modulated volterra process as the boundary of the mild solution , under rather general conditions .",
    "subsequently in section  [ fd ] , we introduce the main contribution of this paper , namely the finite difference scheme for simulating the hyperbolic stochastic partial differential equation . furthermore in that section",
    "we discuss convergence results for the finite difference scheme . finally in section  [ num ] ,",
    "we present some numerical examples from the energy literature using our finite difference scheme , before reaching our concluding remarks in section  [ con ] .",
    "throughout this paper , we shall assume that we are working on a given filtered probability space @xmath4 which satisfies the usual conditions , that is , the probability space is complete , the @xmath5-algebras @xmath6 include all the sets in @xmath7 of zero probability and the filtration @xmath8 is right - continuous .",
    "note that the filtration @xmath8 is indexed by @xmath9 .",
    "following barndorff - nielsen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite we define the volatility modulated volterra process ( vmv process henceforth ) to be a process of the type @xmath10 for @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a constant , @xmath13 is a ( two - sided ) lvy process which is adapted to the filtration @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are real - valued deterministic kernel functions and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are cdlg processes which are adapted to the filtration @xmath14 . here",
    "the stochastic integral can be taken to be defined in the manner developed by basse - oconnor _ et al .",
    "however although vmv processes can be defined for a rather big class of lvy processes we shall in fact only be concerned with vmv processes that are driven by square integrable lvy processes .",
    "hence , due to the left limits in the integrand processes , which imply predictability , the stochastic integration can also be defined in the sense of protter @xcite .",
    "in addition to the assumption that @xmath19 is square integrable , we shall also assume it to have a zero mean and thus a martingale .",
    "since if @xmath20 has a drift we may observe that @xmath21 where @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath23 is a square integrable martingale .",
    "thus , we may rewrite  ( [ def : genxvolt ] ) as @xmath24 where @xmath25 for all @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , we shall assume that @xmath26 \\vee\\mathbb{e}\\bigl [ \\sigma(t)^2\\bigr ] < c\\ ] ] for some constant @xmath27 and all @xmath11 .",
    "using this assumption , we may conclude by minkowski s integral inequality and it isometry that @xmath28 & \\leq & 3 \\biggl(\\mu^2 + \\mathbb{e } \\biggl [ \\biggl(\\int_{-\\infty}^t p(t , s)a \\bigl(s^-\\bigr)\\,\\mathrm{d}s \\biggr)^2 \\biggr ] + \\mathbb{e } \\biggl [ \\biggl(\\int _ { -\\infty}^t g(t , s)\\sigma\\bigl(s^-\\bigr ) \\,\\mathrm{d}l(s ) \\biggr)^2 \\biggr ] \\biggr ) \\\\ & \\leq & 3c \\biggl(\\mu^2 + \\biggl(\\int_{-\\infty}^t\\bigl|p(t , s)\\bigr|\\,\\mathrm{d}s \\biggr)^2 + \\int_{-\\infty}^tg^2(t , s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s \\biggr).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus the vmv process ( [ def : genxvolt ] ) is well defined as an element in @xmath3 if in addition to fulfilling  ( [ stochproccond ] ) the deterministic kernel functions furthermore fulfill @xmath29 for all @xmath11 . in the sequel",
    ", we shall always assume that conditions ( [ stochproccond ] ) and ( [ kernfunccond ] ) are fulfilled , which in turn imply that @xmath30 for all @xmath11 .",
    "of particular interest in many applications is the case when @xmath31 and @xmath32 , that is , when @xmath33 under the additional conditions that the processes @xmath34 and @xmath35 are stationary , the process ( [ def : xlss ] ) is stationary .",
    "in particular , we remark that condition ( [ stochproccond ] ) holds when @xmath36 and @xmath5 are stationary . hence , like barndorff - nielsen _",
    "@xcite , we shall refer to processes of the type ( [ def : xlss ] ) as lvy semistationary processes ( or lss processes ) .",
    "it is furthermore worth noting that in the case when @xmath37 and @xmath32 condition ( [ kernfunccond ] ) is equivalent to @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    now under the assumption that the stochastic processes @xmath40 and @xmath17 are independent to each other and the driving lvy process @xmath19 , we have the following result for lss processes of the type ( [ def : genxvolt ] ) , which is based on a result in @xcite .

    "the solution to the stochastic partial differential equation can in turn be estimated numerically by a finite difference method that we will introduce , which will have the same initial and boundary conditions . for simulating purposes , the initial condition must be finite and therefore the following lemma will prove useful .",

    "here we assume that @xmath91 is a ( potentially unbounded ) infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous semigroup @xmath92 of bounded operators on the hilbert space @xmath84 .",
    "where by a strongly continuous semigroup on @xmath84 we mean that the family of bounded linear operators @xmath93 satisfies the following three conditions :    @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the identity operator on @xmath84 ,    @xmath96 for all @xmath97 ,    @xmath98 for all @xmath99 .",
    "note that a family of bounded linear operators @xmath100 on a banach space that satisfies the above conditions is called a @xmath101-_semigroup_. the domain of @xmath91 , @xmath102 will in general be a proper subset of @xmath84 , but it is always a dense subset in @xmath84 , and its action on @xmath103 is given by @xmath104 for @xmath105 . for references on operator semigroups",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "since @xmath91 is in general not a bounded operator , the notion of a strong solution in the sense of @xmath106 may not always make sense , since @xmath107 might not be in the domain of @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , the notion of a mild solution to ( [ spde : gen ] ) has been introduced in the literature .",
    "a _ mild solution _ to the equation  ( [ spde : gen ] ) is a recast of the differential equation ( [ spde : gen ] ) : @xmath108 in order for the mild solution to be well defined , we need to impose some conditions on the coefficient functions of ( [ spde : gen ] ) .",
    "the first integral @xmath109 is taken to be defined as a bochner integral and is thus well defined if the integrand @xmath110 is measurable and @xmath111 note that the measurability of the integrand from @xmath112 to @xmath113 follows from the strong continuity of the operator semigroup . as for the stochastic integral @xmath114 , recall that by the doob  meyer decomposition , for each cdlg square integrable martingale @xmath115",
    "there exists a unique increasing predictable process , called the _ angle bracket _ of @xmath116 , denoted by @xmath117 such that @xmath118 and @xmath119 is a martingale . for predictable integrands",

    "now for the stochastic integral to be well defined we need to ensure that the integrand @xmath122 is predictable , which follows from the strong continuity of the semigroup , and that it is an element of the space of integrands , that is , that @xmath123 = \\mathbb{e } \\biggl [ \\int_{t_0}^t \\bigl\\vert s(t - s)\\beta(s)\\bigr\\vert _ f^2\\,\\mathrm{d } \\langle m \\rangle(s ) \\biggr ] < \\infty,\\ ] ] for all @xmath124 .    in what follows",
    ", when we work with solutions to ( [ spde : gen ] ) we will always mean mild solutions of the above type ( [ mild : sol ] ) .",
    "now let us reconsider the vmv volterra model ( [ def : genxvolt ] ) .",
    "notice that this equation bears a resemblance to the mild solution ( [ mild : sol ] ) . however , there are some differences which need to be addressed .",
    "first of all , we need to make an assumption on the operator semigroup @xmath93 which is present in ( [ mild : sol ] ) and the function space it operates on .",
    "our assumption will be that @xmath92 is the strongly continuous semigroup of ( left ) translation operators on @xmath84 , defined by @xmath125 for all @xmath99 and @xmath126 . in this case",
    ", it follows from ( [ def : a ] ) that @xmath127 is a differential operator on @xmath84 .",
    "clearly this operator semigroup fulfils the first two algebraic conditions regardless of the selection of the hilbert space @xmath84 . whereas the third condition by contrast is a topological one , and thus dependent upon the norm of the hilbert space . in our setting",
    "we propose to use as state space a hilbert space proposed by filipovi @xcite in the setting of hjm @xcite dynamics . for a positive increasing function @xmath128 , such that @xmath129 it is defined as the space of absolutely continuous functions @xmath130 satisfying @xmath131 endowed with the inner product @xmath132 it is easy to see that the norm induced by this inner product satisfies the strong continuity condition .",
    "moreover for a given @xmath126 , it holds that the evaluation functional @xmath133 defined by @xmath134 is uniformly bounded , see @xcite .",
    "this will in turn allow us to evaluate the mild solution ( [ mild : sol ] ) in any point @xmath126 , provided ( [ afin ] ) and ( [ bfin ] ) hold .",
    "the second issue is that the vmv process is defined on @xmath9 , whereas a mild solution to a hspde is only defined on a half line @xmath135 . for our purposes",
    ", we simply cut the domain of the vmv process in the following way . for a given @xmath11",
    ", we assume that there exists a @xmath136 such that we can approximate @xmath137 in ( [ def : genxvolt ] ) by the process @xmath138 in @xmath3 .",
    "lemma  [ lem : initcond ] confirms that this is possible .",
    "now having truncated the integration domain , we would like to think of ( [ def : x0 ] ) as the boundary of a mild solution ( [ mild : sol ] ) . by adding a spatial component , @xmath139 , to the above equation we get something which we may interpret as a mild solution of a hspde under assumption ( [ lshift ] ) on the operator semigroup . for @xmath126",
    ", we raise the dimension of the truncated vmv volterra model by considering the field @xmath140 now notice that the process @xmath141 can be viewed as a mild solution to the hspde ( [ spde : gen ] ) , where @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 . indeed by considering these coefficient functions for the hspde ( [ spde : gen ] ) under assumption ( [ lshift ] ) on the operator semigroup one obtains that the mild solution ( [ mild : sol ] ) of the hspde ( [ spde : gen ] ) and the process defined in ( [ def : yvolt ] ) coincide .",
    "thus , the vmv volterra process ( [ def : x0 ] ) is the boundary solution to the hspde , which in turn approximates the general vmv process ( [ def : genxvolt ] ) .",
    "given the proposed function space selection let us recall the integrability conditions ( [ afin ] )  and  ( [ bfin ] ) and inspect what they translate into in the case of vmv processes .",
    "let us for simplicity focus on the stochastic integral . in the case , when @xmath147 is a lvy process it holds that @xmath148 , where @xmath149 > 0 $ ] is a constant . if we furthermore recall the square integrability condition ( [ stochproccond ] ) on the volatility , condition ( [ bfin ] ) reduces to @xmath150 in particular , this implies that @xmath151 holds .",
    "further strengthening the condition by letting @xmath152 and assuming that @xmath153 implies that the condition ( [ kernfunccond ] ) is satisfied by @xmath15 .",
    "thus we observe that assuming that ( [ kernfuncsup ] ) holds for @xmath15 and @xmath16 , is sufficient for our purposes with vmv processes and for the solution of the hspde to be well defined .    in",
    "what follows , for a given discretization @xmath154 in the time domain , to simulate a trajectory @xmath155 of the vmv volterra process ( [ def : genxvolt ] ) , we propose the following two step procedure :    truncate the integration domain of ( [ def : genxvolt ] ) from @xmath156 to @xmath157 .",
