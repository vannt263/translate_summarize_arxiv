    "<S> these clusters can be made active .    </S>",
    "<S> colloidal particles acting as `` big '' artificial atoms have been instrumental in studying microscopic processes in condensed matter , from the kinetics of crystallization  @xcite to the vapor - liquid interface  @xcite . due to their size , </S>",
    "<S> colloidal particles are observable directly in real space . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , interactions are widely tunable , ranging from hard spheres to long - range repulsive , short - range attractive , and dipolar  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , colloidal particles can be assembled into a multitude of different structures : from clusters  @xcite and stable molecules  @xcite composed of a few particles to extended bulk structures like ionic binary crystals  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , self - assembly into useful superstructures can be controlled by factors such as confinement  @xcite and particle shape  @xcite , which make colloids a versatile and fascinating form of matter  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> what is still missing are truly long - range attractions of like - charged ( or uncharged ) identical colloidal particles . </S>",
    "<S> there is much interest in the basic statistical physics of systems with such interactions , which play a role in gravitational collapse , two - dimensional elasticity , chemotactic collapse , quantum fluids , and atomic clusters  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one proposed realization are colloidal particles trapped at an interface  @xcite that experience screened , long - range attractions due to capillary fluctuations of the interface  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the concentration profile of a chemical decays as inverse distance , implying long - range interactions that can be tuned through activity ( how chemicals are produced or consumed ) and mobility ( how particles react to gradients ) .    ) , which are exchanged with residual cationic impurities ( here na@xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> different ion mobilities generate local electric fields @xmath2 that slow the hydrogen ions and accelerate the impurities to maintain overal electro - neutrality . </S>",

    "<S> ( d )  in the double layer of the particles , the same effect leads to electro - phoretic flow . ]    here , we implement long - range attractions through hydrodynamic flows coupling suspended particles  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we report on experiments using spherical ion exchange resin particles sedimented to the negatively charged substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the particles have diameters of @xmath5 , for which brownian diffusion is practically negligible on the experimental time scale . </S>",
    "<S> they interact due to self - generated local _ flow _ , resulting in an effective long - range @xmath0 attraction as expected for three - dimensional unscreened gravity . </S>",
    "<S> our present understanding of the mechanism responsible for their aggregation can be summarized as follows  @xcite : by exchanging residual cationic impurities for stored hydrogen ions ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mech]a ) , the particles generate a concentration profile @xmath6 that decays away from the particles . </S>",
    "<S> different diffusion coefficients of the exchanged cations and the released ions locally generate diffusio - electric fields which retain overall electro - neutrality by slowing the outward drift of hydrogen ions and accelerating the inward drift of impurities .     of two particles with separation @xmath4 ( symbols ) . </S>",

    "<S> the total system composed of solvent , ions , and colloidal particles is clearly out of thermal equilibrium through the free energy released by solvating the hydrogen ions , which drives the flow . </S>",
    "<S> however , appealing to a scale separation between particles and solvent , our crucial assumption will be that the motion of the particles themselves can be described by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a conservative potential , @xmath9 is the pair potential eq .  </S>",

    "<S> fig : pot]a . approaching each other </S>",
    "<S> , the speed increases as expected but reaches a maximum at about @xmath18 before it drops rapidly .    </S>",
    "<S> this behavior can be rationalized by considering the generated flows in more detail . in the double layer of the substrate , </S>",
    "<S> the local fields generate electro - osmotic flow of the solvent since the negative substrate is screened by an excess of positive charges ( fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : mech]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the motion of the particles is determined by the slip velocity @xmath19 with ion concentration field @xmath6 and phoretic mobility @xmath20  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , whereby our measured particle velocities are consistent with a constant mobility . for an isolated particle </S>",
    "<S> , the solvent flow is approaching symmetrically and no net motion results ( the particle can be regarded as a sink in two dimensions ; of course , the solvent is incompressible with backflow out of the plane of the substrate ) . for two particles , </S>",
    "<S> the hydrogen ion concentration is increased in the space between the particles , which reduces the gradient ( with respect to the particles surfaces ) and thus the flow velocity . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the flow on each particle now becomes asymmetric , resulting in an apparent attraction ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mech]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> basically the same mechanism acts in the double layer of the particles but now leads to electro - phoretic motion . </S>",
    "<S> the particles themselves are ( slightly ) negatively charged due to the release of cations . </S>",
    "<S> the field generated by the concentration gradient of the other particle again generates a solvent flow , however , now particle and solvent taken together are force - free , which leads to a particle speed in the _ opposite _ direction of the field ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mech]d ) .    for purely diffusive ion motion one would expect the concentration to decay as @xmath21 , but measurements of the ph reveal a more complicated behavior ( these measurements had to be performed for a larger particle , see supplemental material  @xcite , but we expect the qualitative features to be the same for the smaller particles used here ) . while there is indeed a @xmath0 decay regime , closer to the ion exchange particle it changes to a slower decay that is well described as exponential . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that this accumulation is caused by the local fields slowing down outward moving ions . </S>",
    "<S> we model this effect through a term resembling screening although we stress that it originates from the flow and not electrostatics . combining both flows , </S>",
    "<S> the functional form of the potential reads @xmath22 with three free parameters : the prefactors @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and the screening length @xmath25 . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pot]a , this function describes the experimental data very well . from the fit we obtain @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the pair potential @xmath9 plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pot]b has a minimum at @xmath10 . as shown in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pot]b , @xmath29 agrees well with the maximum of the distributions of bond length @xmath4 for dimers and trimers .    </S>",
    "<S> usually , overdamped motion is described by a product of particle mobility and the gradient of the potential energy . </S>",
    "<S> since we do not have access to these terms separately , we treat @xmath9 as an effective `` energy '' absorbing the phoretic mobility @xmath30 , with @xmath9 thus having units of a diffusion coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we can estimate physical energies employing the bare particle mobility @xmath31 , which quantifies the forces needed to move a single particle through the solvent with desired speed . for our particles in water </S>",
    "<S> its value is @xmath32 , yielding forces between particles of order @xmath33 . with @xmath34 , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding bond dissociation energy would thus be @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the final ingredient for our theoretical model is an effective temperature , which we extract from the measured bond fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> first , from the distribution of the bond length @xmath4 for dimers we determine its variance @xmath36 . assuming that these vibrations are effectively equilibrated allows us to determine the analog of a temperature , @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> we test this assumption for three particles , for which a quick calculation predicts that the harmonic bond fluctuations are @xmath38 times larger  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted value @xmath39 is only slightly smaller than the measured variance @xmath40 , the difference of which is due to anharmonic higher - order vibrations .    </S>",
    "<S> our suspension of ion exchange particles is not stationary but slowly collapses to a close - packed state due to the long - range interactions . starting from a homogeneous density profile , during this process we observe the formation of colloidal clusters ( `` molecules '' ) with @xmath41 particles . </S>",
    "<S> this assembly happens autonomously in contrast to prefabricated colloidal molecules  @xcite . while metastable , single clusters can be observed up to minutes , which allows in principle to study in detail different isomers and the `` reactions '' by which larger clusters form ( more details are given as supplemental material  @xcite ) . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dyn]a we show the first few minutes of this process for a dilute suspension . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments were carried out with @xmath42 particles within a field of view corresponding to an area fraction of approx . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath43 . without adjustable parameters , </S>",
    "<S> the observed dynamics are reproduced through the model described by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : lang ] ) . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dyn]b we show a sequence of experimental snapshots for seven particles . </S>",
    "<S> we then perform simulations of the model using the extracted particle positions from the first experimental frame as initial positions . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dyn]c , the simulations agree with the experiments on the same time scale . while for repeated simulation runs the positions differ due to the noise , the average behavior is consistent .    . </S>",
    "<S> solid lines correspond to experimental data ( averaged over several experiments ) , dashed lines to the simulation results of the theoretical model with @xmath44 particles . ]    </S>",
    "<S> this fit - free quantitative agreement is corroborated by the time evolution of the fraction of clusters with weight @xmath41 . from the analysis of the experiments , we extract the fraction @xmath45 of particles residing in clusters with @xmath41 particles . </S>",
    "<S> the range of @xmath46 is between 60 and 90 , and to improve statistics we average over all experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we repeat the same analysis with the theoretical model for @xmath44 , the comparison of which is shown in figure  [ fig : pop ] . </S>",
    "<S> the qualitative behavior is that of irreversible aggregation as described through the smoluchowski coagulation equation  @xcite , with a steady decrease of the monomer concentration and peaks for the @xmath41-mers that become flatter and shifted to later times for increasing weight @xmath41 .    </S>",
    "<S> as demonstrated , for a one - component suspension of ion exchange particles in moderate flow the dynamics of the particles alone is effectively described through a conservative potential . however , for larger aggregates also the flow increases , leading to deviations from the predicted behavior ( _ e.g. _ particles are lifted and pushed into the second layer ) . with even larger flows , particles are observed to spontaneously break the flow symmetry and become self - propelled . </S>",
    "<S> another strategy is to explicitly break symmetry through mixtures of particles with different sizes or shapes , or mixtures of activated and passive particles  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we explore the consequences of adding anionic ion exchange particles of similar size but releasing oh@xmath47 ions , for which we again observe the assembly of low - weight clusters . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown exemplary in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sym ] for two cationic particles and one anionic particle , which assemble into a trimer . as predicted in ref .  , the geometry together with the different mobilities / activities leads to a self - propelled complex . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen through determining the center - of - mass speed of the three particles , which clearly shows a transition to a constant speed once the trimer has assembled .    ) . for times </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 snapshots are shown with cationic particles in red and anionic particles in blue . </S>",
    "<S> the field of view is the same for all snapshots . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line indicates the final speed of the trimer . ]    to conclude , we have shown that ion exchange particles close to a charged substrate generate flows that lead to effectively conservative , long - range interactions . </S>",
    "<S> autonomous flow - driven assembly through long - range attractions might enable novel non - equilibrium materials and strategies in self - assembly , in particular on intermediate scales for which thermal motion has become negligible but which can not be manipulated directly . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , through changing composition one may generate asymmetric flow . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting directed motion of colloidal particles in combination with volume exclusion leads to fascinating dynamic behavior ranging from clustering  @xcite and the formation of `` living crystals ''  @xcite to schooling and swarming  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate how one can implement strategies to control and engineer interactions and directed motion on the same footing  @xcite , which is a step towards designing active particles that can perform dynamical tasks such as transport of cargo  @xcite . concerning the size of the particles used here , we note that there is no conceptual barrier to using smaller particles , the main issue being the ion exchange rate and ion capacity of singe particles that determines the flow strength and the time over which the flow is being generated .    </S>",
