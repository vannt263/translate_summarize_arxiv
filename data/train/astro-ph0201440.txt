    "the number of data sets is 8 for pn and 7 for mos .",
    "figure [ fig : hkatayama - wa3_fig1 ] shows a light curve of pn from one of the lockman hole observations . in order to exclude the flare events , time periods where the count rate deviates from the mean value during quiescent periods by @xmath1 are excluded .",
    "celestial sources and noisy columns are also excluded from the data .",
    "the average exposure time thus remained after excluding the flare events is 18 ks for pn and 26 ks for mos .",

    "figure [ fig : hkatayama - wa3_fig2 ] shows average background spectra of xmm epic . internal backgrounds which are taken with the filter wheel in the closed position are also displayed in the same figure .",
    "the prominent features of the pn background spectrum are al - k , ni - k , cu - k , and zn - k lines .",
    "two line features of the mos background spectrum are al - k and si - k lines .",
    "the overall spectrum is dominated by particle events above 5 kev .",
    "background spectra from individual observations are compared in figure [ fig : hkatayama - wa3_fig3 ] ( top ) .",
    "figure [ fig : hkatayama - wa3_fig3 ] ( bottom ) shows their ratio to the average spectrum .",
    "the fluctuation of spectra is within 8 % at a 1 @xmath0 level .",
    "figure [ fig : hkatayama - wa3_fig4 ] displays the average spatial distribution of the background in different energy bands . the size of the fov for pn and mos is 15 and 14 radius , respectively . in the outside of the fov , no sky x - ray is supposed to be detected , and the gap in the count rate profile is prominent in soft energy bands .",
    "vignetting effect of telescope is also seen in the lower energy band , while the continuum emission in the higher energy band makes almost flat spatial distribution .",
    "fluorescent lines show peculiar profiles ( see xmm user s hand book and @xcite in this contribution ) .",
    "figure [ fig : hkatayama - wa3_fig5 ] and figure [ fig : hkatayama - wa3_fig6 ] display the correlations of count rate between the region of outside of fov and inside of fov in different energy bands .",
    "red , green , and blue crosses indicate the data sets of 0 - 5@xmath2 , 5 - 10@xmath2 , and 10 - 15@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the pn data set shows a good correlation in the energy band of 1.74.0 kev and 4.07.2 kev .",
    "thus , this result represents that the shape of background distribution does not change in theses energy bands .",
    "this also implies that count rate of outside of fov is available for background monitoring . on the other hands",
    ", the mos data set does not show any clear correlation .",
    "as we examined only five data sets for mos1 , further investigation is needed for mos .",
    "in order to investigate the long - term variation of the pn background , we used cal closed data , which is calibration source data with filter closed .",
    "figure [ fig : hkatayama - wa3_fig7 ] ( left ) displays the spectra of the lockman hole , filter closed , and cal closed data .",
    "the 7.013.0 kev band is free from events by the calibration source , and its count rate can be usable for monitoring the background count rate .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : hkatayama - wa3_fig7 ] ( right ) displays the long - term light curve in the 7.88.3 kev and 10.013.0 kev band derived from the cal closed data . the average background count rate decreased by 20 % from march 2000 to january 2001 , however , it regained in february 2001 .",
    "this long term variation is most probably related to the solar activity .",
    "one could see the similar trend in the variation of the number of sunsplots shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : hkatayama - wa3_fig7 ] ( right ) .",
    "in order to obtain the parameter for background modeling , we investigated the correlations between characteristic parameters and the 210 kev count rate .    1 .   number of discarded columns + for pn , the column that detects an event above upper energy threshold and its neighbor columns are removed from the data as a background .",
    "this is called mip rejection .",
    "as most of these mip events are cosmic - ray events , the number of columns that are discarded by mip rejection is expected to be related to the remaining background count rate .",
    "+ figure [ fig : hkatayama - wa3_fig8 ] shows the relation between the 210 kev count rates and the number of discarded columns .",
    "there is no clear correlation between these two parameters .",
    "+ this might be because the energy spectrum of particles changes temporally .",
    "mip events are attributed to all particles of which energy is above a certain extent .",
    "the population of such particles is very large . on the other hands ,",
    "the 2 - 10kev background , in particular the continuum , is attributed to a portion of the whole particles that have a certain configuration of the energy and the incident direction .",
    "therefore , the 2 - 10kev background count rate would fluctuate largely by the temporal change of the particle energy spectrum .",
    "count rate of 1012 kev + for many sources , emissions above 10 kev are negligibly small compared with the background .",
    "thus , the count rate above 10 kev could be usable for the background modeling .",
    "+ in figure [ fig : hkatayama - wa3_fig9 ] , the background count rates in 1012 kev are plotted against those in 210 kev .",
    "the pn data set shows a good correlation , while the mos data set does not show a clear correlation .",
    "count rate of outside of fov + figure [ fig : hkatayama - wa3_fig10 ] displays the 210 kev count rate detected outside of fov vs. that in fov .",
    "the pn data set shows a good correlation . + the good correlation seen for the pn data can be usable for monitoring the background . in order to examine the efficacy , each spectrum shown in figure 3 is renormalized so that the corresponding count rate of outside of fov becomes the same as that of the average value .",
    "figure [ fig : hkatayama - wa3_fig11 ] shows the fluctuations ( standard deviations of 1 @xmath0 ) of original spectra and corrected spectra .",
    "the variation of pn background spectra decreases from 8 % to 3 % in the 27 kev band .",
    "finally , we show the comparison of the background spectra among different x - ray ccds onboard xmm , asca , and chandra . the background spectrum of asca sis is obtained from a blank sky data .",
    "the chandra acis - s and acis - i data used here are also taken from blank sky observations compiled by @xcite .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : hkatayama - wa3_fig12 ] shows the background spectra normalized by ccd area , which thus represents the background count rate per unit area on the focal plane .",
    "as these spectra include cxb component , a direct comparison on the particle event flux is meaningful only above about 5kev .",
    "the difference of the background count rates among different instruments should be explained by the cosmic - ray - particle flux depending on the satellite orbit , and the sensitivity of the ccds , which is governed by the thickness of the depletion layer and other structure ( e.g. front - illuminated or back - illuminated ) .    in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : hkatayama - wa3_fig12 ]",
    ", each spectrum is normalized by the effective area of the x - ray telescope plus ccd and by the solid angle of the fov .",
