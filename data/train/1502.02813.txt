    "fluctuations of non - equilibrium steady states of driven diffusive lattice gases have attracted a lot of attention in the last two decades @xcite . although many of these studies assumed purely diffusive , particle conserving dynamics , lattice gas models with dissipation have also been investigated @xcite .",
    "the absence of detailed balance makes dissipative systems more difficult to handle .",
    "there is , however , a steady interest in dissipative models , mostly because of their relevance to experiment in such diverse areas as fluid turbulence @xcite , granular gases @xcite and many other non - equilibrium settings in physics , chemistry , biology and engineering .    the simplest way to characterize",
    "a non - equilibrium system is to study its steady state . to maintain a dissipative systems in a steady state one",
    "must constantly drive it by injecting energy or mass .",
    "the total energy or mass content of the driven system fluctuates around the mean , and these fluctuations bear the stamp of the non - equilibrium nature of the system . in this work",
    "we consider three different driven models of diffusive particles where particles can die : either individually or by annihilating in pairs . in each of these models",
    "the system is driven by injecting particles into a half - infinite straight line from a single point - like steady source .",
    "the particles diffuse and die so that , at long times , a non - equilibrium steady state sets in . if the particles do not interact , their total number @xmath1 is poisson - distributed with mean @xmath2 predicted from a deterministic reaction - diffusion equation for this driven system . our main interest in this case will be to find the optimal ( that is , most probable ) density history of the system conditional on observing a given @xmath1 .",
    "we also consider two types of _ interacting _ particle models : ( i ) diffusive lattice gases of mortal particles with constant diffusivity but non - trivial fluctuations ( as illustrated , for example , by the simple symmetric exclusion process @xcite with mortality ) , and random walkers on a lattice that can annihilate in pairs . in both these cases the statistics of @xmath1",
    "is expected to be non - poissonian , and we calculate the _ variances _ describing typical , gaussian fluctuations of the particle number around the mean .",
    "we obtain these results by employing ( a dissipative extension of ) the macroscopic fluctuation theory ( mft ) : a coarse - grained low - noise large - deviation theory that employs , as a large parameter , the typical number of particles in the region of interest , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review .",
    "the applicability of the mft in the driven systems , considered in this work , demands @xmath3 , and we will work in the parameter regions where this condition is satisfied .    here is a plan of the remainder of the paper .",
    "section ii starts with a brief exposition of the expected , or average behavior of a driven system of non - interacting random walkers or brownian particles that die individually .",
    "then subsection iib presents the mft formulation of the problem of particle number statistics for a more general family of diffusive lattice gases of particles that die individually . for the non - interacting particles , we are able to solve , in the same subsection iib , the mft equations exactly . the solution , via the hopf - cole transformation , reproduces ( the large-@xmath1 asymptotic of ) the expected poisson distribution of @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , it gives the previously unavailable optimal density history of the driven system , conditional on observing a given @xmath1 .",
    "section iii deals with two examples of _ interacting _ particles .",
    "the first of them deals with a family of mortal interacting diffusive lattice gases with constant diffusivity but non - trivial fluctuations , as illustrated by the simple symmetric exclusion process with mortal particles .",
    "the second example involves random walkers that only interact via pair - wise annihilation . in these examples a full solution of the mft problem is presently unavailable , and we only calculate the variances of the respective stationary distributions of @xmath1 . our main results and their possible extensions are briefly discussed in section iv .",
    "consider a half - infinite one - dimensional lattice with lattice constant @xmath4 and suppose that a source of particles at the origin , @xmath0 , sets a constant particle number density @xmath5 there .",
    "the particles perform random walk at @xmath6 with diffusivity @xmath7 and die individually with rate @xmath8 .",
    "when @xmath9 , there is no difference between the discrete random walk and continuous diffusion , and the average particle density @xmath10 is governed by the reaction - diffusion equation @xcite @xmath11 at long times the average density profile approaches a steady state , independent of the initial condition : @xmath12 correspondingly , the average steady - state number of particles in this driven system is @xmath13 and we assume that this number is much larger than unity .",
    "the actual number of particles @xmath1 in the steady state fluctuates around @xmath2 because of the shot noises of the diffusion and mortality .",
    "we are interested in the steady - state probability distribution of @xmath1 . for non - interacting random walkers that die individually",
    "this probability distribution can be found exactly , by solving the steady - state master equation for the multi - variate probability distribution of observing @xmath14 particles on site 1 , @xmath15 particles on site 2 , etc .",
    "the solution has the form of the poisson product measure with space - dependent parameters [ for @xmath9 , this measure corresponds to the average density profile ( [ mfsteadysol ] ) ] .",
    "this leads to a poisson distribution of @xmath1 in the steady state .",
    "we will proceed , however , as if we were unaware of these exact results , and employ instead the mft : a coarse - grained low - noise theory mostly based on the strong inequality @xmath3 .",
    "the purpose is two - fold .",
    "first , even for the non - interacting particles , the mft will give the previously unknown optimal density history of the driven system , conditional on observed @xmath1 .",
    "the optimal density history is well defined only in the limit of @xmath3 , where it is _ much _ more likely than other histories leading to the same @xmath1 .",
    "second , our main interest is in _ interacting _ particle models , where exact microscopic results are usually unavailable . in the next subsection",
    "we briefly discuss the basics of the mft , and formulate the mft problem for the particle number statistics in a broader context of a family of driven lattice gases of mortal particles .",
    "when ( i ) the length scale of interest is much larger than the lattice constant @xmath4 , ( ii ) the time scale of interest is much larger than the inverse rates of the microscopic processes of diffusion and death , and ( iii ) the typical number of involved particles is much larger than unity , the statistics of large deviations is captured by the mft @xcite .",
    "the starting point of the derivation of the mft for diffusing and reacting particles is the exact master equation for the multi - variate probability distribution of observing a certain number of particles on each cite . here",
    "one can either work directly in the physical space , or employ the multi - site probability generating function ( that , in the spatially - continuous limit , becomes a probability generating functional ) .",
    "going over to a path - integral formulation , one then makes a low - noise approximation by evaluating the path integral by the laplace method that employs the number of particles in the relevant region of space as a large parameter .",
    "this procedure yields saddle - point equations ( partial differential equations ) that can be written in a hamiltonian form : for the density field @xmath16 and a conjugate field @xmath17 that plays a role of the  momentum density \" . at a qualitative level ,",
    "the conjugate field @xmath17 describes the magnitude of fluctuations .",

    "the terms proportional to @xmath8 describe the on - site particle death and its fluctuations .",
    "the rest of terms describe diffusive transport and its fluctuations . equations ( [ d1gen ] ) and ( [ d2gen ] ) are indeed hamiltonian , as they can be written in terms of variational derivatives : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the hamiltonian , and @xmath23 is the hamiltonian density .",
