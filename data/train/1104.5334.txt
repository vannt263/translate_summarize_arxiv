    "graphene , a newly realized two - dimensional crystal of carbon atoms ordered on a honeycomb lattice,@xcite is being extensively studied due to its unusual electronic and structural properties .",
    "undoped graphene is a zero - gap semiconductor with a linear low - energy dispersion relation and a vanishing density of states at the fermi level.@xcite although the coulomb interaction is unscreened in this regime , the system behaves mostly as a non - interacting electron liquid , where the minor effects of interactions are encoded in a renormalization of the fermi velocity and the quasiparticle lifetime.@xcite the opposite case is that of a divergent density of states , the so called van hove ( vh ) singularity , which is associated to a saddle point in the band dispersion.@xcite if the fermi level lies near such a singularity , screening is perfect for wave - vectors connecting vh singularities and correlation effects may be enhanced .",
    "recently , several experimental groups have succeeded on making this regime accessible for graphene.@xcite the techniques used for this aim are different : in ref .",
    "they have used twisted graphene , obtained from a rotation between stacked graphene layers , which allows one to tune the position of the vh singularity .",
    "other methods involve chemical doping of graphene@xcite or intercalation of gold clusters between the graphene layers.@xcite this opens up the fascinating possibility to study correlated electronic phases in this material , such as superconductivity , charge - density wave ( cdw ) or spin - density wave ( sdw ) .",
    "the proximity of the fermi level to a vh singularity in most of the cuprate superconductors has triggered large efforts to understand the role of a peaked density of states ( dos ) on the electronic properties of an electron liquid.@xcite superconductivity , itinerant ferromagnetism ( fm ) , cdw , and sdw are examples of competing instabilities associated with the vh scenario . in graphene ,",
    "the existence of some of these instabilities has already been evidenced by recent experiments , such as cdw@xcite or superconducting pairing due to electron - electron interactions,@xcite following the kohn - luttinger mechanism.@xcite cdw and sdw phases usually occur in systems with fermi surface nesting , i.e. when the fermi surface can be mapped onto itself by a ( nonzero ) @xmath2-vector ( nesting vector ) . at low doping , graphene shows some nesting , since the fermi surface is composed of two circles around the @xmath3 and @xmath4 points .",
    "however , since the dos is very low , these peaks are small and a very high ( hubbard ) interaction is required to enter the dw regime.@xcite the situation changes if we strongly dope graphene around the value @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the chemical potential and @xmath7ev is the hopping parameter .",
    "the fermi surface then acquires a hexagonal shape and nesting occurs in three directions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the vh singularities lie at the fermi surface for this doping . at these points ,",
    "the dos diverges and we expect some non - trivial peaks in the susceptibility .    in this paper , we investigate the hubbard model in a honeycomb lattice using a field theoretical approach . by performing a hubbard - stratonovich transformation , we determine the effective action in terms of an 8-component order parameter , which accounts for charge- and spin - degrees of freedom in the a and b graphene sublattices .",
    "we find that the charge susceptibility never diverges for repulsive interactions , thus excluding the possibility of a cdw formation , whereas the spin susceptibility exhibits several peaks .",
    "the peaks at the nesting wavevectors @xmath2 are stronger than the one at @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , thus signaling that sdw is the leading instability , that wins against fm for repulsive interactions .    in the following ,",
    "we introduce the model and outline the main steps of the calculations in sec .",
    ", we present the temperature vs interaction vs doping phase diagram and show that the metallic state becomes unstable towards a sdw phase for realistic values of the interaction parameter @xmath9 in sec .",
    "finally , we discuss possible experimental techniques which could be used to observe our results and draw our conclusions in sec .",
    "due to the strong screening of interactions by the electron gas at the vh filling , we consider only the local coulomb repulsion ( the usual hubbard u term ) , which is a good approximation around this doping level.@xcite this term leads to a deformation of the band dispersion toward the saddle point,@xcite an effect that has been observed experimentally by arpes.@xcite notice that longer - range interaction terms , such as the nearest - neighbor repulsion , would lead to a richer phase diagram , with the possibility of a pomeranchuk instability.@xcite this scenario is in sharp contrast with low doped graphene , for which the dos vanishes and the coulomb interaction will be only slightly screened and therefore will be long ranged .",
    "hence , we use a tight - binding model with a hubbard interaction @xmath9 , @xmath10 where the operator @xmath11 can be either @xmath12 or @xmath13 , depending whether @xmath14 is a label of the @xmath15 or @xmath16 sublattice , respectively . defining @xmath17",
    ", the hubbard term can be rewritten using the relation , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the on site number operator and @xmath20 , describes the spin on the lattice site @xmath14 .",
    "note that the inner product @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is some vectorial field , is defined by @xmath23 , and that @xmath24 is the vector of pauli matrices .",

    "( [ eq1h ] )",
    ". we will investigate the possible appearance of cdw and sdw instabilities by using a path integral formalism recently developed by some of the authors.@xcite in the following , we briefly outline the procedure .",
    "we start by performing a hubbard - stratonovich transformation that eliminates the quartic term in the action , but introduces eight auxiliary bosonic fields @xmath30 ,",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 related , respectively , to the electronic and the magnetic degrees of freedom of the fermionic fields of each sublattice . in fourier space , the action then reads @xmath34,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 .",

    "the self energy is given by @xmath43,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the number of sites of each sublattice and both , @xmath45 and @xmath46 carry a subindex @xmath47 . by introducing the eight component vector @xmath48 and integrating out the fermionic fields",
    ", we obtain the effective action @xmath49,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and the partition function becomes @xmath51 \\exp(-s_\\textrm{eff}/\\hbar)$ ] .",
    "finding the susceptibility from here is a two steps process .",
    "first , we introduce external source fields @xmath52 and then we expand the fields in the action around their mean field value @xmath53 .",
    "this results in a self - consistent equation for the mean field values of the fields . using this equation",
    ", we may determine how the bosonic fields react on a distortion of the source fields .",
    "for @xmath54 .",
    "brighter regions correspond to higher peaks in the spin susceptibility .",
    "the peaks at the three nesting wavevectors ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) are higher than the one at @xmath55 , indicating that the sdw instability wins over the fm one . ]",
    "the mean field values are those at which the action has an extremum .",
    "thus , the linear terms in @xmath56 are imposed to vanish , yielding the self - consistent equation @xmath57,\\ ] ] where @xmath58^{\\rm t}$ ] and the trace is taken over the matrices only , because the sum takes care of the trace in @xmath2- and frequency - space .",
    "after differentiating this equation with respect to the source @xmath52 , one finds the susceptibility through the relation @xmath59 where @xmath60 moreover , we can also determine the free energy by performing a legendre transformation @xmath61= u^{-1}\\langle\\mathbf{m}\\rangle^{\\dag}_{j } \\cdot \\mathbf{j}-\\ln(z[\\mathbf{j}])$ ] on the partition function which , up to quadratic order in the deviation @xmath62 and without an additive constant , is @xmath63=\\frac{1}{2\\hbar u^2}\\left ( \\delta\\langle\\mathbf{m}\\rangle_{j}\\right)^{\\dag } \\cdot ( \\mathbf{\\chi}_{0}^{\\rm rpa})^{-1 } \\cdot\\delta\\langle\\mathbf{m}\\rangle_{j}.\\ ] ] the susceptibility @xmath64 is evaluated in the absence of the source field , @xmath65 . from here on , we assume that the system is in a homogeneous state , for which the mean field values of the boson fields are given by @xmath66 as a consequence , the self - energy , the green s function and the susceptibility matrix @xmath67 are all diagonal in momentum and frequency space . due to a nonzero self - energy , the hamiltonian gets renormalized , such that @xmath68 where @xmath69 is given by the first term in eq .",

    "notice that the overlap between the electron and hole wave - functions is taken into account through the term @xmath77 .     for @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "notice that the peak corresponding to sdw at @xmath80 is larger than the fm peaks at @xmath81 and @xmath82 . ]",
    ".numerical values of the critical coupling @xmath83 ( in units of @xmath84 ) for a fm and a sdw phases calculated on a 10000@xmath8510000 mesh .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "next , we investigate the possible instabilities by considering the static susceptibility @xmath86 . to evaluate the latter , one needs to perform a sum over all momenta in the brillouin zone .",
    "we proceed by dividing the brillouin zone in an @xmath87 mesh , which implies that the sum in the expression for the susceptibility has @xmath88 terms .",
    "the instability condition for repulsive interactions requires the interaction strength @xmath9 to exceed the critical value @xmath83 defined by @xmath89 this relation links the critical interaction strength to the largest eigenvalue @xmath90 of the matrix @xmath91 by @xmath92 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] a density plot of the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath91 is shown for a temperature of @xmath93 k. one can distinguish four inequivalent peaks ( bright regions in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the one at @xmath94 corresponds to a fm instability , while the other three , at nonzero @xmath95 , correspond to the three independent nesting vectors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and hence give rise to a sdw .",
    "although not expected , for all temperatures the sdw peaks turn out to be higher than the peak corresponding to the fm phase ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "however , this result depends heavily on the size of the mesh : for low temperatures , the sum converges slowly , and a wrong result can be inferred if @xmath44 is not large enough .",
    "indeed , by considering a @xmath96 mesh , we find that a fm phase would set in at low temperatures [ see fig .",
    "[ fig4c ] ] , whereas the results for a finer mesh ( @xmath97 ) indicate that the true ground state is a sdw [ see fig .",
    "[ fig4a ] and fig .  [ fig4b ] ] .",
    "scales as @xmath98 and will therefore increase if the doping level is tuned away from @xmath99 . ]    for zero temperature and a doping value exactly at the vh singularity , the critical coupling for both fm and sdw is zero . as explained below ,",
    "our formalism is not suited to determine which state is more favorable . for finite temperatures ,",
    "the sdw phase transition has a lower critical @xmath9 than the fm one .",
    "therefore , between the red and blue lines in fig .  [ fig4 ]",
    "we find a sdw phase . above the blue line ,",
    "the system allows for a fm phase transition .",
    "the starting point of our formalism is a homogeneous ground state , after which we can determine the critical @xmath9 that is needed to enter a more ordered phase , like the fm , sdw or cdw phase . to reach the regime above the blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , one has to start from a sdw ground state and subsequently determine if a phase transition to the fm phase will occur .",
    "since the sdw ground state is inhomogeneous , our formalism is thus unable to determine the leading instability when @xmath9 is in this regime .",
    "if the system is tuned away from optimal doping , the vh singularities will no longer lie on the fermi surface and nesting is reduced in general .",
    "this will result in a lowering of the peaks in the maximal eigenvalue of the susceptibility and hence the critical couplings will increase .",
    "this behavior is shown in fig .",
    "the sdw peak is always higher than the fm one , but the height decreases quite rapidly as function of doping . the interaction strength in graphene can not be tuned externally . although at low doping the onsite hubbard interaction is estimated to be around @xmath100,@xcite values of @xmath9 for highly doped graphene are , to the best of our knowledge , not yet known , but should not be different from the low - doping values .",
    "we therefore expect that a sdw phase should be observed experimentally , in the regime of @xmath1 and @xmath9 parameters shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( see also table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "recently , a cdw has been experimentally observed in twisted graphene bilayers doped at the vh singularity , but it has disappeared when the hopping parameter between the two layers has been put to zero.@xcite a cdw phase seems also to be present for graphene grown on top of a superlattice of gold intercalated clusters,@xcite and a superconducting phase has been conjectured to occur for graphene heavily doped with ca and k on both sides.@xcite however , it is unclear which is the appropriate theoretical model to describe graphene under these circumstances , and for the conventional hubbard model in a single layer , a cdw can only occur for attractive on - site interactions .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have evaluated possible sdw and cdw instabilities from a metallic phase for the honeycomb lattice of a single layer of graphene doped at the vh filling .",
    "we found that charge and spin degrees of freedom are decoupled , and that cdws occur for attractive , whereas sdws occur for repulsive interactions .",
    "a peak in the spin - susceptibility at zero wave - vector has also been found , although precise calculations indicate that it is always sub - dominant with respect to the ones appearing at the nesting wavevectors , thus determining that the sdw instability must win over fm in the neighborhood of the metallic phase .",
    "this finding contradicts a previous result in the literature,@xcite and could only be reached after a very careful and time consuming computation in a very large mesh .",
    "an interesting point is that the sdw phase is expected to occur at rather high temperatures .",
    "this is not very surprising , given that phenomena such as cdw or the integer quantum hall effect , that usually occur at very low temperatures , have already been detected at high temperatures in graphene ( @xmath101k for the first and room temperature for the latter).@xcite we hope that our results may stimulate further experiments to unveil the existence of a sdw phase in heavily doped graphene .",
