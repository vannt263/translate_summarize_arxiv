    "many of the signatures of the cosmological time dilation and the radiation mechanisms of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are hidden in the temporal and spectral characteristics of grbs .",
    "the subject of this paper is the analysis of the temporal properties of the bursts , and the correlations between intensities and timescales .",
    "we use the batse time - to - spill ( tts ) data , which can give much higher time resolution than other forms of batse data for most bursts . the advantages and shortcomings of this data",
    ", our decomposition of the time profiles into pulses , and the evolution of burst characteristics are described in greater detail in the accompanying paper @xcite .",
    "what follows is a brief summary .",
    "( see also @xcite . )",
    "many burst time profiles appear to be composed of a series of discrete , often overlapping , pulses , often with a _ fast rise , exponential decay _",
    "( fred ) shape  @xcite .",
    "the different pulses may represent emission from distinct subevents within the gamma - ray burst source .",
    "therefore , it may be useful to decompose burst time profiles in terms of individual pulses , each of which rises from background to a maximum and then decays back to background levels .",
    "we have analyzed gamma - ray burst time profiles by representing them in terms of a finite number of pulses , each of which is described by a small number of parameters .",
    "we have used the phenomological pulse model of @xcite to decompose gamma - ray burst time profiles into distinct pulses . in this model , each pulse is described by five parameters with the functional form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the time at which the pulse attains its maximum , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the rise and decay times , respectively , @xmath4 is the pulse amplitude , and @xmath5 ( the  `` peakedness '' ) gives the sharpness or smoothness of the pulse at its peak .",
    "we have developed an interactive pulse - fitting program to perform this pulse decomposition on the batse tts data . and used this program to fit pulses to all gamma - ray bursts in the batse 3b catalog  @xcite up to trigger number 2000 in all of the four batse lad energy channels for which tts data is available and shows time variation beyond the normal poisson noise for the background .",
    "we fit each channel of each burst separately .",
    "we have obtained 574 fits for 211 bursts , with a total of 2465 pulses .    in this paper , we focus on the possibility of distinguishing between intrinsic signatures in the temporal characteristics and those which arise from their cosmological distribution . a prominent example of this is the cosmological time dilation effect , which we expect to see since some , and possibly all , gamma - ray bursts originate at cosmological distances .",
    "all timescales in grbs will be lengthened by a factor of @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the redshift of the burst , as a result of cosmological time dilation  @xcite . however , this seemingly straightforward test is not simple .",
    "first of all , given the great diversity in burst time profiles , it is difficult to decide which timescale is most appropriate for this test .",
    "it seems unlikely that any particular timescale is approximately the same in all bursts , so we expect to find time dilation as a statistical effect , rather than for individual bursts .",
    "secondly , redshifts are known only for a few bursts , so that for the vast majority of bursts we need to use another measure of distance or redshift .",
    "most past analyses have used some measure of apparent grb brightness for this purpose with the tacit assumption that the corresponding intrinsic brightness is a standard candle or has a very narrow distribution .",
    "the observed apparent brightnesses of bursts are generally measured using either peak fluxes , which give the instantaneous intensity of bursts when they peak , or fluences , which measure the total output of bursts integrated over their entire durations .",
    "the brightness measures can also be divided another way , into photon measures and energy measures .",
    "thus , there are several different measures of the apparent brightnesses of bursts .",
    "the batse burst catalogs give peak photon fluxes and total energy fluences for bursts .",
    "the pulse - fitting data presented here can be used to determine count fluxes and count fluences .",
    "most previous work on the evidence for time dilation in burst time profiles has binned the bursts into two or three brightness classes using the peak flux as a measure of brightness , and compared a measure of total burst duration these classes .",
    "use of fluence as a brightness measure has been promoted by @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use a number of different timescale and brightness measures .",
    "we will describe their correlations using power laws .",
    "although cosmological models generally predict more complex relationships than a simple power law , it would be fruitless to attempt to fit anything more complex than a power law using the pulse - fitting data , which appears to have a large intrinsic scatter .",
    "to contrast the cosmological versus the intrinsic signatures , we compare the relations or correlations between strengths and timescales among bursts , which should contain the signatures of cosmological time dilations , with the same correlations among pulses of individual bursts , which can only contain the intrinsic effects .",
    "it is likely that some of these correlations are affected by selection effects in our fitting procedures . to investigate the importance of these ,",
    "we have carried out extensive simulations which are described in the accompanying paper @xcite .",
    "we use the results of these simulations to test whether or not the correlations we find are properties of the bursts or are products of our procedures . in the next section , we define the various timescales and burst strengths used in this analysis .",
    "the correlations relevant to the `` time dilation '' tests are discussed in section  [ sec : timedilation ] and the correlations between other quantities within bursts and among bursts are described in section  [ sec : othercorr ] . in section  [ sec : discuss ] we discuss the significance of these correlations .    it should be noted that many of the simulated bursts were affected by a truncation that almost never occurred in the actual batse tts data .",
    "the tts data is truncated at @xmath8 counts or 240 seconds , whichever occurs first . in nearly all of the actual bursts ,",
    "the 240 second limit is reached first , while in many of the the simulated bursts , the @xmath8 count limit is reached first .",
    "this truncation can shorten the observed time intervals between the first and last pulses in a burst , and between the two highest amplitude pulses in a burst , but not the observed pulse widths or the observed time intervals between consecutive pulses .",
    "_ therefore , all discussions of the first two kinds of time intervals in simulated bursts will only consider simulated bursts where no pulses were truncated by the @xmath8 count limit . _",
    "we now describe the characteristics used in our correlation studies and the selection and procedural biases associated with each of them .",
    "we use peak count rates and count fluences as measures of burst intensity or strength . for individual pulses , the peak count rate is given by the amplitude @xmath4 and the count fluence by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the gamma function . for a burst , on the other hand , the peak count rate is @xmath11 , the largest amplitude of the pulses in the burst , and the total count fluence is @xmath12 , summed over all pulses .",
    "the most obvious timescale for individual pulses is the _ pulse width _",
    ", which is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fraction of the peak height at which the width is measured .",
    "and @xmath5 is the `` peakedness '' parameter . in this paper",
    ", we use the case @xmath15 , for which the width is the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "we will discuss the correlations between pulse width and intensity measures in the next section . here",
    "we consider some other timescales , namely the _ time intervals between pulses _ , which may also be characteristic of the gamma - ray production mechanisms .",
    "there are several possible choices of time intervals .",
    "we ll examine the _ intervals between consecutive pulses _ first , which may have the following selection effect : two pulses with short separations between their peaks may have a large overlap , and thus be identified as only one pulse . this will limit the shortest interval between pulses , introducing a selection bias . on the other hand ,",
    "when two pulses have a long separation between them , additional smaller pulses may be resolved between them that would nt be resolved if the separation were smaller .",
    "this will limit the the longest intervals between consecutive pulses , introducing another selection bias .",
    "figure  [ sim_interval ] shows the distributions of the intervals between the peak times @xmath1 of adjacent pulses for the simulations and the fits to simulations .",
    "it shows that the fitting procedure identifies pulses with longer separations correctly , but misses most pulses with shorter separations .",
    "figure  [ npvsdt ] shows the time intervals between consecutive pulses for bursts with different numbers of pulses , as derived from our fits to the batse data and from the simulations .",
    "note that here and in similar figures to follow , we show only data from channels  2 and 3 .",
    "in general , channels 1 and 4 show similar behavior , but results from these channels have lower significance because these channels contain fewer pulses .",
    "table  [ tab : npvsint ] , columns  ( a ) gives the spearman rank - order correlation coefficients @xmath16 between these two quantities , and the probabilities that the observed correlations have occured by chance .",
    "these show that pulses tend to be closer together in bursts with more pulses , in both the actual bursts , and in the simulated bursts and in the fits to simulated bursts .",
    "one selection effect that may contribute to this result in actual bursts is that more complex bursts may simply be bursts with stronger signal - to - noise ratios , which allows more pulses to be resolved within any given time interval .",
    "our analysis of the simulated bursts and the fits to the simulations show similar results .",
    "this result is as expected , since pulse peak times were generated independently of each other and of the number of pulses per burst , so more complex bursts will tend to have more pulses in any given time interval . the correlation is weaker for the fits to simulated bursts than for the original simulated bursts because the fitting procedure tends to miss pulses with shorter separations .",

    "however , the determination of this interval can be greatly affected by whether or not low amplitude pulses can be identified above background .",

    "figure  [ npvsdur ] and columns  ( b ) of table  [ tab : npvsint ] compare the number of pulses in each burst with the time interval between the first and last pulses in each burst .",
    "they show that the time intervals between the first and last pulse are greater in bursts with more pulses , both in actual bursts , and in simulated bursts and fits to simulated bursts . in actual bursts , this may result from the selection effect described above ; more complex bursts may simply have stronger signal - to - noise ratios , making it easier to identify earlier and later pulses . in the simulated bursts and the fits to simulated bursts , this is also as expected since the peak times of pulses were generated independently of the number of pulses in each burst .    a third time interval",
    ", the interval _ between the peak times of the two highest amplitude pulses _ in a burst , may also represent a characteristic time scale for the entire burst .",
    "determination of this interval should be less affected by the selection effects that we have seen with the intervals between consecutive pulses . however , the identification of the two highest pulses may be affected by whether a particular structure in a burst is identified as a single pulse with large amplitude or as multiple overlapping pulses with smaller amplitudes .",
    "the interval between the two highest amplitude pulses should be less influenced by the selection effects in the fitting procedure that affect the interval between the first and last pulses in a burst .",

    "it appears that unlike the first two time intervals described above , there is no tendency for the third time interval to be shorter or longer in bursts with more pulses .",
    "this suggests that the interval between the two highest pulses in each fit is nt subject to the signal - to - noise selection effects that affect both the intervals between adjacent pulses and the interval between the first and last pulse in each burst .",
    "the upshot of the above analysis is that the correlations between time intervals and numbers of pulses per burst ( or complexity ) in the simulated bursts is similar to that of the actual batse data , indicating that the simulated data provides a good representation of these aspects of the actual data , and can be used to determine the biases in the data and in the fitting procedure .",
    "we now consider the correlations between timescales and intensities among pulses within bursts and among the bursts to determine the presence of time dilation or time stretching and to test if this is due to cosmological redshift of the sources .",
    "if we assume that the peak luminosities of bursts are approximately a standard candle , then the correlations between pulse amplitudes and timescales can be used to test time dilation .",
    "this corresponds to the amplitudes of the constituent pulses in bursts .",
    "it has previously been found that higher amplitude pulses have shorter durations ( are narrower ) ,  @xcite , but it has been noted that this could be in part or entirely an intrinsic property of bursters .",
    "a potential problem with using peak flux as a distance measure for bursts observed by batse is that data binned to 64  ms have been typically used , so that the peak fluxes of bursts with sharp spikes may be underestimated .",
    "( see  @xcite . )",
    "this should be less of a problem with the variable time resolution tts data , where the time resolution is inversely proportional to the count rate and every spill represents the same number of counts .",
    "the pulse - fitting data from actual batse bursts shown in the upper panels of figure  [ ampvsw ] clearly shows that higher amplitude pulses tend to be narrower , or have shorter durations .",
    "table  [ tab : ampvsw ] gives the spearman rank - order correlation coefficients , which show that pulse amplitudes and pulse widths are inversely correlated in all energy channels .",
