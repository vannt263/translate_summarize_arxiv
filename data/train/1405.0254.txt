    "the matrix version of the charge - changing ( or  pn \" ) skyrme qrpa has been applied with some success in spherical nuclei . when the rotational symmetry of the mean field is broken , however , the dimension of the mean - field two - quasiparticle basis increases by orders of magnitude and the qrpa matrix becomes too large to fit in the main memory of a typical computer without aggressive truncation .",

    "because the pnfam treats only charge - changing transitions and hfbtho does not allow proton - neutron mixing , our results depend only on charge - changing densities [ those with isospin indices @xmath9 ; the usual coulomb and kinetic contributions to the total energy in eq .",

    "the time - odd coupling constants are either neglected completely or are constrained solely by gauge invariance .",
    "some time - odd couplings can be profitably fit to the energies and strengths of gamow - teller resonances ; see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite or ref.@xcite . here",
    "we will sometimes use the simple prescriptions of ref .",
    "the ability to treat charge - changing resonances in deformed nuclei via the pnfam should soon open the door to a better determination of the t - odd functional .",
    "when tensor terms are included , there is an additional subtlety in the time - even channel that determines mean - field properties in even - even nuclei .",
    "the term involving the spin - current tensor @xmath21 can actually be decomposed into three tensor components @xcite : @xmath22 most groups ( e.g.  the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite ) have thus far fit the tensor terms solely in spherical nuclei . there , the spin - orbit density @xmath23 is the only non - vanishing component of eq .",
    "@xcite . when spherical symmetry is broken , however , the contribution of the pseudotensor @xmath24 is non - zero in the mean field and introduces another ( undetermined ) coupling constant . in our calculations with hfbtho ,",

    "@xcite derives a form of the fam that corresponds to the like - particle qrpa .",
    "the formulation is general enough , however , to cover the charge - changing case as well . in the following",
    "we discuss the special features of the fam that follow from charge changing , i.e.  from choosing an external field that transforms neutrons into protons ( e.g. for @xmath28 decay ) .",
    "charge - changing transitions are generated by a weak external field @xmath29 , with ( complex ) angular frequency @xmath30 , of the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a small real parameter and @xmath33 is a one - body operator that could depend on @xmath30 but in our application does not . transformed to the quasiparticle basis , it has the form @xmath34 where the ellipses refer to terms of the form @xmath35 that do not contribute to the linear response .",
    "the summation runs over every pair of quasiparticle states in the basis , avoiding double - counting .",
    "a one - body @xmath28 transition operator ( fermi , gamow - teller , or forbidden ) can be written in a single - particle basis as @xmath36 where the index @xmath37 runs over proton states and the index @xmath38 over neutron states .",

    "the weak external field @xmath33 induces weak time - dependent oscillations in the quasiparticle annihilation operators ( e.g.  for neutrons ) , @xmath44 these oscillations in turn lead to oscillations in the charge - changing density matrix elements @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the charge - changing pairing tensors @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and the resulting energy functional @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath50 and pairing potential @xmath51 likewise acquire time - dependent pieces through the relations @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a proton index and @xmath54 a neutron index , or vice versa .",
    "the oscillations in all quantities occur with the same frequency @xmath30 , and the time - dependence , which is contained only in exponentials like those in eq.([eq : f1 ] ) , can be factored out and removed .",
    "the fam then amounts to solving the small - amplitude limit of the time - dependent hfb equation ( with the time dependence factored out ) .",
    "the reason the procedure is so efficient is the numerical computation of the derivatives of @xmath50 and @xmath51 in the direction of the perturbation , i.e.  with respect to @xmath32 . in our pnfam the differentiation is somewhat easier than in the like - particle case because the charge - changing parts of @xmath55 and @xmath56 vanish at the hfb minimum ( since our hfb does nt mix protons with neutrons . )",
    "that restriction , together with the linear dependence of @xmath50 and @xmath51 on the charge - changing densities for all published skyrme functionals , means that the pnfam numerical derivatives are independent of the parameter @xmath32 .",
    "in fact , our code does nt reference @xmath32 at all and we do not need to worry , as did the authors of ref.@xcite , about choosing @xmath32 small enough so that terms of @xmath57 are negligible , but large enough to avoid round - off errors .",
    "when all is said and done , the pnfam equations for the linear response become @xmath58 where the @xmath59 s are the hfb quasiparticle energies and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the pieces of the frequency - dependent hfb hamiltonian matrix , expressible in terms of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , that multiply the quasiparticle pair - creation and annihilation operators , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f2 ] ) @xcite .",
    "one can go on from eqs .   to derive the traditional matrix - qrpa equations by expanding @xmath62 and @xmath63 in @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( on which @xmath66 depends implicitly via the densities ) and taking the limit of vanishing external field .",

    "the last three equations imply the symmetry @xmath76    to evaluate non - unique forbidden decay rates we will need to take into account the interference between distinct transition operators , called @xmath33 and @xmath77 here for simplicity .",

    "together with modern optimization techniques , the efficient calculation of linear response should make for a vast improvement in our ability to describe beta decay and predict it in important @xmath0-process isotopes where measurement is not possible .",
    "we have adapted the finite amplitude method for the computation of beta - decay strength functions and rates in axially - deformed even - even nuclei with modern skyrme - like energy - density functionals .",
    "while formally equivalent to the traditional matrix qrpa , the fam is far more robust and just as useful as long as the full set of qrpa energies and transition - matrix elements is not needed .    to demonstrate the pnfam s power ,",
    "we have taken a first look at the effect of skyrme s tensor terms on allowed and first - forbidden beta decay in open - shell isotopes .",
    "we find that the tensor interaction lowers half - lives in deformed nuclei much like it does in the spherical nuclei studied in ref .",
    "working with the functional sko@xmath128 , we are able to roughly reproduce measured rates in a range of nuclei without strong isoscalar pairing and without spoiling the predictions of the functional in even - even systems .",
    "it is clearly time to explore time - odd functionals systematically , and we intend to do so soon . finally , beta decay is only one possible application of the pnfam .",
