    "it is widely believed that the release of gravitational energy from an disk of accreting matter onto a super massive black hole ( smbh ) generates a huge amount of energy in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",

    "estimated the position of the central engine of by measuring the core shifts at varying frequency and observing an exterior source as a phase reference .",
    "the absorption processes that cause core shifts are synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ) and free  free absorption ( ffa ) . in ssa",

    "figure  [ fig : cp ] reveals that the core position of shifts at all other observational frequencies relative to the 43 ghz core . by least - squares fitting , the core position is found to shift as a power - law function of frequency ; that is @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are projected ( east  west ) distance from the 43 ghz core , free - fitting parameters representing a scale factor , a power low index , and an asymptotic limit at infinite frequency , respectively ( solid curves in figure  [ fig : cp ] ) . at the approaching jet side , these values are determined as @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , respectively , with residuals @xmath26/n.d.f = 0.16 ( see table  [ tab : cs ] ) .",
    "this reduced @xmath26 is very small because we estimated the core positional errors conservatively .",

    "when the shifting core of the counter jet was fitted to a three - parameter model , we obtained @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "however , these errors have little contribution for confining the position of the central engine .",
    "this suggests that a simple power - law is insufficient to represent the profile of counter - jet side .",
    "hence , we applied two alternative model fitting procedures imposing further assumptions , which will be discussed in section [ sec : cs ] .",
    "spectral index ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) maps were generated from final ( self - calibrated and cleaned ) images between two adjacent frequencies using the aips task comb . to ensure proper construction of spectral index maps , the images between the adjacent frequencies must spatially align , and their angular resolutions must match .",
    "the map coordinates at each frequency were aligned using the core shift relative to the 43  ghz core in right ascension and the jet axis of in declination .",

    "the spectral index gradients are clearly parallel to the jet axis for all frequency pairs .",
    "the restored beams in each map are too large to decompose the absorption structures across the jet .",
    "however , a transverse gradient marginally appear at 12 ghz and 25 ghz spectral index maps",
    ". we can not rule out that the combination of the north  south fluctuation in the jet structure ( section  [ sec : coreshiftmeasurement ] ) and remaining position errors in east  west direction causes the apparent transverse gradient .",
    "figure  [ fig : slice ] shows slice profiles of spectral index along the jet axis ( from the east to the west ) .",
    "we estimated error components in the spectral index .",
    "we tentatively displaced one image eastward and westward with respect to the other image by our conservative positional error , in order to evaluate a spectral index error due to the positional error in overlaying two images .",
    "we also used the spectral error map , simultaneously produced during comb processing , and assumed a conservative flux calibration error of 5% at @xmath36  ghz and 10% at @xmath37  ghz .",
    "the total error represented by an envelope is the square root of the summed squares of these error components .    at 815",
    "ghz and lower frequency pairs , a region of @xmath35 appears in the slice profiles , suggesting an ffa mechanism , although the error is too high for a conclusive assessment .",
    "another feature is that the curve at @xmath38 5  ghz peaks at the counter jet side .",
    "the peaks are located at the same positions , regardless of the error - induced displacement of the core position . at @xmath39 5",

    ", a core shift was discovered downstream of the jet .",
    "core shift measurements of and other blazar sources revealed that the base of the jet is located @xmath43 from the 43 ghz core position @xcite .",
    "recently , core shift data have accumulated at an accelerated pace for blazars @xcite . however , the above - cited examples highlight the difficulty of proving assumptions from one - sided jets .    to overcome these limitations , we located the central engine in by investigating a double - sided system and measuring the core positions of approaching jet and counter jet .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : large ] , the core ( most upstream component ) at the counter jet side resides at @xmath44  mas ( @xmath45 ) from the approaching - jet core at 43 ghz .",
    "the central engine and black hole must be situated at most 750  @xmath2 distant from this core to ensure its location between the cores of both jets . moreover , because the origin of the counter jet coincides with that of the approaching jet ( as discussed later ) , the assumption that the origin of a jet spatially coincides with the central engine within the error tolerance is reasonable for .",

    "assuming @xmath109 and @xmath110 as the profile indices , corresponding to the stabilization of jet energy in equipartition , @xmath111 invariably becomes unity regardless of the spectral index value .",

    "the curve predicted by the pure ssa model ( dashed line in figure  [ fig : cs ] ) can explain the core position at both low frequency ( @xmath11 2  ghz ) and high frequency ( @xmath119 22  ghz ) .",
    "on the other hand , the observed positions of the core at 5 , 8 , and 15  ghz are significantly larger than those predicted by this model , implying that the ssa model alone lacks sufficient absorption to explain the core shift in these regions .",

    "thus , @xmath157 pc provide a reasonable upper limit , indicating the lower limit of @xmath125 .",
    "on the other hand , this density profile can not explain the small opacity at the high frequency ( @xmath119 22 ghz , @xmath175 ) .",
    "the interpretation under a simple pow - low profile requires a large @xmath124 such as @xmath176 , which leads to a sufficiently high temperature of plasma to reduce ffa effect at the inner region ( 22  ghz ) .",
    "however , this is impractical because the disk temperature at 3  @xmath2 should be too high ( @xmath177  k ) .",
    "the weak effects of ffa at the 22  ghz core indicate that the disk structure changes dramatically at a characteristic radius .",
    "the riaf model is suitable for describing this situation of the low density at inner radii of an accretion .",
    "in fact , x - ray observations suggest that a low luminosity and flux and spectral variations of the nuclear x - ray emission of ngc  4261 can be caused by an accretion disk with a low accretion rate with a low radiative efficiency such as riaf @xcite .",
    "therefore , we propose the accretion flow of ngc  4261 has a two - component structure ; one is an inner , hot , optically thin , riaf and the other is an outer , truncated , cool , optically thick accretion disk .",
    "this structure is considered to be not expedient for ngc  4261 but common for llagns based on broad spectral energy distribution  ( sed ) and x - ray spectral studies @xcite .      according @xcite , the transition radius , @xmath178 , in an accretion disk",
    "is given by @xmath179 where @xmath180 and @xmath181 denote the black hole mass in units of solar masses , @xmath182 and the mass accretion rate in eddington unit , @xmath183 , @xmath184  g s@xmath60 .",
    "inserting @xmath185 and @xmath186 to equation  ( [ equ : xc ] ) , we obtain @xmath187 , requiring a significantly higher accretion rate compared to that of the typical llagns ( @xmath188@xmath189 ) .",
    "recently , the equation of the transition radius is modified by the disk evaporation model taking account the effects of viscosity and magnetic field in accretion flow @xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath185 is easily acceptable for @xmath190 , which is an expected accretion rate for ngc  4261 .",
    "consequently , this combined model of riaf and truncated disk is a possible solution to explain the core shift of at both side simultaneously .",
    "figure  [ fig : disk ] show this schematic illustration .",
    "it is necessary to explain an observed large column density of @xmath191 , where @xmath192 represents the column density , toward the nucleus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with an x - ray luminosity of @xmath193 ; the origin of the power - law x - ray emission is controversially associated either with the accretion flow or the base of the jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "first , we consider the case that the x - ray absorber would be the outer thin disk . substituting @xmath194 in equation  ( [ equ : n ] ) , the emission is passing through the region of a density of @xmath195 @xmath168 . in case of @xmath196 pc ,",
    "we obtain @xmath197 @xmath198 indicating to be consistent with the x - ray observation .",
    "however , the geometrically thin disk can obscure only the counter jet in this case .",
    "it is inappropriate to make only the counter jet take responsibility for the x - ray emitting source .",
    "second , we consider the case that the x - ray absorber would be the inner accretion flow . we adopt a simple adaf model @xcite with @xmath199 as a free - fall density profile and @xmath200 at @xmath201 .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity , suggesting an accretion rate of @xmath202 , roughly provides an electron temperature and restricts the amount of accreting material . in this condition , a resultant ffa opacity at @xmath175 at 22  ghz is significantly less than unity ( cf .",
    "appendix ) , which is consistent with our vlbi result . however , total electron column density toward the nucleus ( down to 3  rs ) is at most @xmath203 through the accretion flow .",
    "thus , only the accretion flow can not be responsible for the large column density observed at x - ray .",
    "consequently , neither the outer thin disk or the inner riaf seems to be a sufficient x - ray attenuator ; an external absorber , such as a dusty torus , along our line of sight is required to explain x - ray observations .",
    "we measured the origin of jets at the radio galaxy as the limit of the core position at infinite frequency using a core shift profile .",
    "the origin is @xmath204 @xmath27as ( projected ) distant from the 43 ghz core position , corresponding to @xmath205 ( deprojected ) .",
    "we also measured the core shift at the counter jet side and confirmed that the core positions at both sides asymptotically converge to the same limit .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the jet origin estimated by core shift measurements spatially coincides with the central engine .",
    "the spectral index maps reveal the possible presence of ffa , @xmath206 , in at least a limited area in the counter jet side .",
    "the core shift profile of the counter jet is not solely attributable to synchrotron self - absorption and requires an additional absorbing component such as a geometrically thin disk .",
    "moreover , the core shift and ffa opacity profiles from our result suggest a two - component accretion such as a combined model of riaf and truncated thin disk that is previously proposed for accretion flows of llagns to explain observed seds . the density and temperature profiles for the outer thin disk as free  free absorber are estimated to be @xmath207  k and @xmath208  @xmath168 , respectively , in the case of @xmath157  pc . neither the outer thin disk or the inner riaf seems to be a sufficient x - ray attenuator ; an external absorber , such as a dusty torus , along our line of sight is required to explain an observed high column density toward the nucleus .",

    "<S> we report multi - frequency phase - referenced observations of the nearby radio galaxy , which has prominent two - sided jets , using the very long baseline array  ( vlba ) at 1.443  ghz . </S>",
    "<S> we measured radio core positions showing observing frequency dependences ( known as `` core shift '' ) in both approaching and counter jets . </S>",
    "<S> the limit of the core position as the frequency approaches infinity , which suggests a jet base , is separated by ( @xmath0 )  micro - arcsecond upstream in projection , corresponding to ( @xmath1 )  @xmath2 ( @xmath2 ; schwarzschild radius ) as a deprojected distance , from the 43  ghz core in the approaching jet . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the innermost component at the counter jet side appeared to approach the same position at infinity of the frequency , indicating that cores on both sides approach the same position , suggesting a spatial coincidence with the central engine . applying a phase - referencing technique </S>",
    "<S> , we also obtained spectral index maps , which indicate that emission from the counter jet is affected by free  free absorption ( ffa ) . </S>",
    "<S> the result of the core shift profile on the counter jet also requires ffa because the core positions at 515  ghz can not be explained by a simple core shift model based on synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ) . </S>",
    "<S> our result is apparently consistent with the ssa core shift with an additional disk - like absorber over the counter jet side . </S>",
    "<S> core shift and opacity profiles at the counter jet side suggests a two - component accretion : a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) at the inner region and a truncated thin disk in the outer region . </S>",
    "<S> we proposed a possible solution about density and temperature profiles in the outer disk on the basis of the radio observation . </S>"
