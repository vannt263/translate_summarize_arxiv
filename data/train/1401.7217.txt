    "the discovery of vast numbers of extrasolar planets over the past two decades has revealed that many planets lie much closer to their stars than the planets in our solar system ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the main methods of discovery , radial velocity and transit observations , tend to favor close - in planets .",
    "many are so close to their star that tides must have played significant roles in their orbital evolution , especially after the planet formation process was complete and the circumstellar nebula and disk had dissipated ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "tides tend to circularize orbits , reduce their semi - major axes , and heat the planets , so the current orbital distributions provide important constraints on physical properties , long - term histories , and past or present habitability",
    ".    the current distribution of semi - major axes must reflect the process of removal of close - in planets as they spiral down into the star . as a planet gets too close , its tidal evolution accelerates , like driftwood approaching a waterfall .",
    "thus , understanding tides may help explain the character of the distribution of close - in planets .",
    "for example , @xcite , @xcite , and others have studied this effect for single - planet systems .",
    "the distribution of eccentricities also records the circularizing effect of tides .",
    "as the first close - in planets were discovered , their substantial eccentricities seemed inconsistent with the short `` timescale '' for tidal damping ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these substantial eccentricities can be explained by taking into account the coeval tidal effect on semi - major axis : these planets have spent most of their lives farther from the star , where eccentricity - damping was weaker @xcite .",
    "another factor might be that a still - undiscovered planet ( or planets ) farther from a star could help maintain the eccentricity of an inner planet by gravitational perturbations .",
    "indeed , multi - planet systems have been found to be so numerous that it is reasonable to expect that even where only a single close - in planet has been detected , there is plausibly at least one additional planet farther out .",
    "here we consider the possible effects of secular planet - planet interactions on the tidal evolution of planets in a multi - planet system .",
    "certainly , if the outer planet has an eccentric orbit , secular perturbation theory requires that the inner orbit must also be eccentric . in any planetary system ,",
    "gravitational secular interactions periodically exchange angular momentum among the planets .",
    "thus the effect of tides on a planet s orbit will be different than it would have been if the other planets were absent .",
    "in fact , the orbits of all the planets in a system evolve due to tides acting on only one of them .",
    "in this paper we will show several examples of how important it is to consider the multi - planet nature of systems when analyzing their tidal orbital evolution .",
    "we focus on interior companions to warm jupiters in sections [ infall ] and damping . by definition ( e.g. @xcite )",
    "warm jupiters lie beyond @xmath1 au . at that distance ,",
    "any jupiter - scale planet around a solar - scale star would experience little direct tidal evolution .",
    "an outer planet can rapidly drive its inner companion into the star ( section  [ infall ] ) , reducing the multiplicity of those systems .",
    "moreover , outer planets , even those relatively far from the star ( far enough so that they would have minimal direct tidal evolution ) , can have their eccentricity damped strongly through tidal damping on the innermost planet ( section  [ damping ] ) .",
    "thus , a planet may have had a higher eccentricity in the past even if direct tidal effects on that planet have been negligible . in section",
    "[ constrain ] we analyze an observed system as a contrasting example and demonstrate how we can place constraints on current eccentricities that ensure the system has been stable throughout its lifetime ( section  [ constrain ] ) .",
    "we use the analytical framework of classical secular theory ( @xcite and @xcite ) to investigate the response of multi - planet systems to tides .",
    "analytic solutions allow broader generalizations than computer intensive , n - body numerical integrations , which can only apply to the specific system being simulated . on the other hand ,",
    "the analytic approach of secular theory constrains us to low - to - moderate eccentricities because it ignores terms in the disturbing function that are higher than second order in eccentricity . also , by considering only secular terms , we are constrained to non - resonant systems",
    ". fortunately , many ( if not most ) multi - planet systems inhabit this region of parameter space in any case , numerical and analytical approaches are complementary , offering greater precision and physical interpretability , respectively .    in order to facilitate a secular solution ,",
    "each eccentricity is described as a vector whose magnitude is the scalar eccentricity @xmath2 and with direction the longitude of pericenter @xmath3 .",
    "the cartesian coordinates of the eccentricity vector are given by @xmath4 and @xmath5 . to second order in the eccentricities ,",
    "the differential equations governing a planet s eccentricity behavior are linear :    @xmath6    where the matrix elements @xmath7 describe the perturbing gravitational potential .",
    "( we order planets from innermost to outermost . )",
    "if only mutual gravitational perturbations are considered , the matrix @xmath8 depends only on the masses and semi - major axes of the system .",
    "any additional effects on the precession of planet @xmath9 add to the magnitude of @xmath10 .",
    "generally , the most significant such effect is the contribution of general relativity ( gr ) to @xmath11 , though the non - spherical figures of the planets and star can contribute as well @xcite . in this paper , we include gr and precession caused by the planets equilibrium tidal bulge .",
    "the solution to this set of linear differential equations ( eqn [ kdot ] and [ hdot ] ) is a sum of eigenmodes :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the eigenfrequency and @xmath14 is the phase of eigenmode @xmath15 . for a system of @xmath16 planets",
    "there are @xmath16 eigenmodes .",
    "the ordering of eigenmodes is arbitrary . for consistency",
    "we number the modes in order of decreasing @xmath13 ( i.e. @xmath17 is greatest ) . in accordance with eqns",
    "[ kvst ] and [ hvst ] , figure [ one ] shows how the eigenmodes will combine to describe the periodic behavior of a planet s eccentricity in a two - planet system .",
    "the eccentricity of each planet @xmath18 is the vector sum of the rotating eigenmode components @xmath19 , and each @xmath19 rotates in ( @xmath20,@xmath21 ) space at a rate given by its eigenfrequency .",
    "thus the eccentricity varies , although the magnitudes of all the @xmath22 are fixed .    for each mode ,",
    "the ratios among the various @xmath22 values are given by the eigenvectors .",
    "for example , in a two - planet system , @xmath23 is given by the eigenvector ( @xmath24,@xmath25 ) as @xmath26 .",
    "as defined here , the eigenvectors are normalized such that @xmath27 where the summation is over all planets @xmath9 .",
    "all @xmath28 are functions of the coefficients @xmath7 from eqns [ kdot ] and [ hdot ] . given the eigenvectors , each coefficient @xmath22 in the solution ( eqns [ kvst ] and [ hvst ] )",
    "is the product of the amplitude @xmath29 of eigenmode @xmath15 and the normalized eigenvector component @xmath28 for that mode and planet :    @xmath30    where the @xmath29 values are derived from the initial conditions ( specifically the initial values of the eccentricities and pericenter longitudes of all the planets ) .      to incorporate the effect of tides",
    ", we use the formulation presented by @xcite and @xcite which aggregated results from various sources ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "that model is based on a constant tidal dissipation parameter @xmath0 that is independent of frequency , i.e. the tidal response has a constant phase lag for all fourier components . whether that assumption is a valid representation of the response of a real planet is uncertain , because tidal dissipation is an interplay of complex and",
    "only partially understood physical processes involving the friction - caused delay between the tidal strain and stress and self - gravity , along with turbulence , friction between layers , etc . moreover , given these uncertainties , the standard practice of applying a lag to each fourier component and summing the results may not always apply @xcite , although for linear rheologies , such as the maxwell rheology adopted by @xcite , it is of course valid .    because our approach retains only low - order terms in the tidal disturbing function , it is insensitive to high frequency effects , and thus is relatively independent of uncertainty in the frequency dependence of tidal responses .",
    "also , as we retain terms in the gravitational disturbing function only through 2nd order in @xmath2 , it is appropriate to go only to 2nd order in eccentricity in the tidal model as well .",
    "so , while other mathematical models ( such the constant time lag model of @xcite ) allow for expansion to higher order in eccentricity , those high - order terms may be less physically meaningful than their apparent precision may suggest and use of those higher order terms here would cause a mismatch in precision between the tidal model and the orbital dynamical model .    according to the formulation by kaula and by goldreich and soter , for planets with orbits shorter than the spin period of the star ,    @xmath31    @xmath32    where    @xmath33    @xmath34    and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the mass and radius of the star , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the mass and radius of planet @xmath9 , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the tidal dissipation parameter for the star and planet @xmath9 respectively ( thus @xmath41 is the tidal dissipation for the innermost planet , etc ) . here , what we call @xmath0 is actually @xmath42 of @xcite where @xmath43 . terms involving @xmath44 result from tides on the planet , and",
    "those involving @xmath45 result from tides on the star .",
    "we can compare the relative strengths of planetary and stellar tides by taking the ratios of the terms due to each in eqns [ adot ] and [ edot ] :    @xmath46    @xmath47    where @xmath48    in this paper we use @xmath49 @xcite and @xmath50 for jovian planets ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "for rocky planets , @xmath40 is @xmath51 or smaller ( @xcite and references therein ) . for",
    "main sequence stars the combination of masses , radii and @xmath0 in eqn [ edotratio ] is large , meaning that planetary tides will dominate the eccentricity evolution . for semi - major axis evolution ,",
    "the ratio of contributions from planetary and stellar tides ( eqn [ adotratio ] ) is proportional to the same combination of masses , radii and @xmath0 as in eqn [ adotratio ] , but multiplied by @xmath52 ( eqn [ adotratio ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath2 must be very low for stellar tides to dominate the planet s semi - major axis evolution .",
    "figure [ plavsste ] shows @xmath53 as a function of stellar mass ( @xmath35 ) for planets of various sizes and tidal dissipation factors .",
    "in addition to causing orbital evolution , tides generate heat in the periodically distorted body .",
    "the surface heat flux ( in @xmath54 that results is :    @xmath55    this result follows from considering the energy budget of the system .",
    "energy dissipated in the planet can only come from its orbit , not from its rotation , because the planet would have spun - down much earlier .",
    "furthermore , the energy loss can only come from the planet s changing semi - major axis , because orbital energy depends only on @xmath56 , not @xmath2 .",
    "thus , by using the relationship between orbital energy and semi - major axis , eqn [ heat ] follows from eqn [ adot ] above @xcite . the heating can be significant .",
    "for example , tidal heating likely plays a role in generating the radius anomalies of some hot jupiters ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "secular interactions exchange angular momentum , but not energy , among the planets .",
    "consequently , each planet s semi - major axis changes at a rate given by eqn [ adot ] above , identical to what it would if the planet were a single planet . however , the tidal eccentricity damping of one planet will be shared among the system s eigenmodes .",
    "thus all the planets eccentricities will evolve differently than if they were single ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , because eqn [ adot ] for @xmath57 depends on @xmath2 , the long - term evolution of the semi - major axes of all planets will be affected by the combination of tides on one planet and the secular interactions .",
    "tidal evolution occurs slowly compared with the periodic secular changes in eccentricity ( i.e. the process is adiabatic ) .",
    "thus we can average the tidally driven change in the semi - major axes and eigenmode amplitudes @xmath29 over the secular cycle .",
    "this averaging can be done analytically .",
    "@xcite derived formulas for @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( eqns 16 and 19a-19d in that paper ) for evolution due to tides on the inner planet . in appendix [ appa ]",
    "we extend that analysis to derive formulas for @xmath58 and @xmath60 , including tides on both planets in a two - planet system and tides on the star . in order to study the evolution of a system",
    ", one can integrate those equations over time numerically .",
    "the long - term evolution of a two - planet system is greatly simplified if one mode damps much faster than the other . under what conditions",
    "does that occur ?",
    "one can often ignore dissipation in the second planet because of the strong dependence of tidal effects on distance , so to address this question we consider only the effects of tides on the inner planet in the following argument ( though we include tides on both planets in all our integrations ) .",
    "for a damping process acting on the inner planet s eccentricity , according to appendix [ appa ] , the ratio @xmath61 of the resulting damping of the two eigenmode amplitudes is given by    @xmath62    ( note that @xmath63 is negative so @xmath61 is positive , see appendix [ appa ] ) .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath61 , the more of the eccentricity damping is partitioned to mode 1 ( by definition the mode with the greater eigenfrequency ) . for a case where planet - planet interactions dominate ( and other effects like gr are negligible ) , @xmath61 is a function of only @xmath64 and @xmath65 , as shown in figure [ damp1 ] .",
    "also , for any given @xmath64 , @xmath61 decreases monotonically with @xmath65 ( figure [ damp1 ] ) .",
    "for some choices of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 , i.e. both eigenmodes damp on comparable timescales . for examples of such systems",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , and section [ constrain ] below . for many cases of interest @xmath67 , in which case @xmath68 for any choice of @xmath64 ,",
    "i.e. eigenmode 1 will always damp faster than eigenmode 2 .",
    "so , under what conditions will mode 1 damp _ much _ faster than mode 2 ?",
    "if the planets are comparably massed ( if , for example , they were both jovian or both terrestrial ) and @xmath64 is less than @xmath69 , then @xmath70 . also , if the inner planet is much smaller than the outer planet ( i.e. the inner planet is terrestrial and the outer planet is jovian ) , then for any @xmath64 less than @xmath71 , @xmath61 would be @xmath72 .",
    "these situations would thus have the amplitude of mode 1 ( @xmath73 ) damp much faster than that of mode 2 ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "because effects that act only on the precession rates ( e.g. gr ) contribute only to the diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath8 , including these effects would increase @xmath63 and @xmath75 ( eqn [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] ) , thus increasing @xmath61 .",
    "for a single planet , eqns [ adot ] and [ edot ] show that its @xmath76 due to planetary tides is always faster than @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "thus , the planet s tidal eccentricity damping will happen quickly relative to its semi - major axis migration .",
    "when the planet s eccentricity becomes so small that tides on the planet are negligible , semi - major axis evolution will still continue due to tides raised on the star , but only slowly .",
    "such a planet can survive for a very long time before being destroyed as it reaches the star .",
    "in contrast , in a multi - planet system the damping of one or more of the eigenmode amplitudes ( @xmath79 ) can be slower than @xmath77 for either of the planets . in other words ,",
    "a tidally worked planet can have its eccentricity remain significant much longer than if it were the only planet .",
    "but its semi - major axis will decrease more quickly because @xmath57 due to planetary tides is proportional to @xmath52 ( eqn [ adot ] ) .",
    "this planet will therefore have a shorter lifetime than it would if it were a single planet .",
    "in other words , the planet can reach the roche zone of the star even with minimal contribution from tides on the star .",
    "consider the tidal evolution of planet hat - p-15b , with current mass @xmath80 , radius @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 orbiting a g5 star of mass @xmath84 and age @xmath85 gyr @xcite .",
    "we adopt for the uncertain tidal dissipation parameters the plausible values @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( see section  [ tides ] ) . assuming the planet is and has always been single , integration of eqs .",
    "[ adot ] and [ edot ] back in time yields the evolution shown by the dashed lines in the right - hand panels of figure [ hata ] .",
    "the orbital changes are modest and nearly linear with time , with @xmath56 changing by less than 1% and @xmath2 reduced from @xmath88 to @xmath89 .",
    "the tidal heating rate correspondingly decreased by about 30% .",
    "suppose hat - p-15b was originally ( 7 gyr ago ) accompanied by an interior rocky planet , of mass @xmath90 and @xmath91 , with @xmath92 and @xmath93 . throughout this paper , for the rocky planets we use @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "if such a rocky planet were unaffected by the outer planet , integrating eqns [ adot ] and [ edot ] yields the orbital evolution shown by the dashed lines in the left - hand panels of figure [ hata ] .",
    "the eccentricity @xmath95 damps away so quickly ( on a timescale of 20 myr ) that tidal dissipation nearly stops and @xmath96 remains essentially constant .",
    "next we consider the evolution of the two - planet system ( the solid curves in figure [ hata ] ) .",
    "the initial conditions for the inner planet ( at 7 gyr ago ) are the same as defined above ; for the outer planet , we have selected initial conditions that lead to the current observed orbit of hat - p-15 b. for this case , eqn [ reldamp ] ( along with figure [ damp1 ] ) shows that mode 1 dominates the damping of the inner planet ; correspondingly this mode damps at a rate comparable to the damping of @xmath95 for the case where the outer planet is ignored , i.e. mode 1 damps away in @xmath97 million years . for studying the evolution over billions of years ,",
    "we assume that mode 1 has damped away by the start of this evaluation , and set the amplitude @xmath73 of this mode to zero . with only one eigenmode",
    ", there is no oscillation of either planet s eccentricity over secular timescales , so @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the evolution is shown by the solid curves in figure [ hata ] .",
    "for the inner planet ( figure [ hata ] ( left ) ) , starting from the initial values , both @xmath96 and @xmath95 decrease gradually over the course of the first 400 myr .",
    "the change in @xmath96 is due to the combined effect of tides raised on the inner planet on the star and on the star by the planet",
    ". the contributions of these two effects over the course of the evolution are shown in figure [ hatb ] ( top ) . during these first 400 myr ,",
    "tides raised on the planet are dominant in reducing @xmath96 .    at the same time , tides cause @xmath95 to decrease . with secular mode 1 assumed to be negligible , the tidal damping only affects the amplitude @xmath74 of mode 2 .",
    "@xmath74 is damped by tides raised on both planets and on the star .",
    "figure [ hatb ] ( middle ) shows the effect of tides raised on the star and on both planets .",
    "the latter is dominated by inner - planet tides . during the first 100 myr ,",
    "@xmath74 damps at a rate @xmath100%/gyr .",
    "however , the evolution shown in figure [ hata ] shows @xmath95 damping much faster , changing by @xmath72% during the 100 myr .",
    "a similar discrepancy continues for at least the first 400 myr .",
    "( though we have set the amplitude of @xmath73 to zero , we show @xmath101 in figure [ hatb ] ( middle ) .",
    "as can be seen in this figure , the damping rate of @xmath73 is indeed much much faster than that of @xmath74 , as predicted from looking at the behavior of @xmath61 ( eqn [ reldamp ] , figure [ damp1 ] ) . )",
    "why does @xmath95 decrease so quickly , even though the amplitude of the eigenmode does not ?",
    "recall that @xmath95 also depends on the eigenvector , which describes how much of mode 2 is shared with the inner planet : @xmath102 .",
    "although the tidal damping of the amplitude @xmath74 is very slow , @xmath103 changes much more quickly as shown in figure [ hatb ] ( middle ) .",
    "in fact , its rate of change of about @xmath104% per 100 myr is close to that of @xmath95 .",
    "thus the decrease of @xmath95 is not due to direct tidal damping of the eccentricity , but rather to the change in @xmath96 which results in a change in the partitioning of the magnitude of mode 2 between the planets . as @xmath96 decreases , the strength of the secular coupling between the planets diminishes , until mode 2 predominantly affects the outer planet and has little effect on the inner one .",
    "consequently @xmath95 decreases rapidly .    during this period ,",
    "the decrease in @xmath96 accelerates , because of the strong dependence of @xmath105 on @xmath96 ( eqn [ taup ] ) . at the same time",
    ", the change in @xmath95 accelerates as well , because of the uncoupling of the secular interaction .",
    "eventually , after about 430 myr , @xmath95 is so small that the change in @xmath96 begins to decelerate ( figure [ hatb ] top ) , although the planet does continue to migrate inward to the planet .",
    "after 440 myr , the planet is close enough to the star that the contribution of tides on the star to @xmath105 ( which is independent of eccentricity ) begins to become significant , and the inward migration accelerates again . just after about 460 myr from the start",
    ", the planet reaches the roche limit where it would be tidally disrupted .    during the entire lifetime of the inner planet ,",
    "the decrease of @xmath95 tracks the change in @xmath96 , as the planets become decoupled and a decreasing share of eigenmode 2 goes to the inner planet .",
    "this decoupling is illustrated in figure [ hatb ] ( bottom ) , where the component that affects the inner planet ( @xmath103 ) decreases relative to the share that goes to the outer planet .",
    "the outer planet s eccentricity also damps during this period as the damping of the second eigenmode affects both planets .",
    "note that if the eigenvector ( @xmath106,@xmath75 ) remained constant over the 460 myr , @xmath107 would damp in proportion to @xmath95 .",
    "however , figure [ hata ] ( right ) shows that @xmath107 drops by only @xmath100% during this period ( compared with nearly 100% for @xmath95 ) , because of the change in the eigenvector as the planets becomes less coupled .",
    "just as the change in the eigenvector accelerates the decrease of @xmath95 , it slows the decrease of @xmath107 , which is actually dominated by the damping of the amplitude @xmath74 of eigenmode 2 .",
    "after the inner planet is destroyed , the tidal evolution of the orbit of the outer planet continues at a modest rate until the current orbit of hat - p-15 b is reached .",
    "this example demonstrates how the presence of an outer planet can accelerate the tidal migration and subsequent demise of an inner planet .",
    "the fact that a `` warm jupiter '' like hat - p-15 b currently displays no evidence of any inner planets does not imply that it formed in a system with no inner planets .",
    "all planets that have an outer companion have a shorter lifetime than they would as singles . however , this effect is more dramatic for some parameters than for others . for a given outer planet ,",
    "the larger @xmath96 is , the greater is @xmath108 and thus @xmath95 .",
    "this greater @xmath95 increases tidal dissipation tending to reduce the planet s lifetime . on the other hand",
    ", tides also depend strongly on @xmath96 ( eqn [ taup ] and [ taus ] ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath45 and @xmath44 on @xmath96 ( eqn [ taus ] and [ taup ] ) is much stronger than that of @xmath95 .",
    "so , the smaller @xmath96 is , the shorter the lifetime .",
    "but , that dependence applies whether the planet is single or has an outer companion . if we compare the single - planet case to the multi - planet case , the latter always has a shorter relative lifetime .",
    "the larger @xmath96 is , the greater this difference because of the increased @xmath95 driven by the outer planet .",
    "a potentially important consequence of a planet s eccentricity history is the effect on tidal heating , because the heat generation is proportional to @xmath52 ( eqn [ heat ] ) .",
    "the bottom panels of figure [ hata ] show the tidal heat generated within hat - p-15 b and its possible inner companion .",
    "because the inner rocky planet s eccentricity is sustained by the outer planet , its level of tidal heating is not turned off after 100 myr as it would be if the planet were single . moreover , due to the strong @xmath56-dependence of @xmath21 ( eqn [ heat ] ) , as the rocky planet s semi - major axis decreases , the level of tidal heat increases .",
    "as the planet approaches the star , tides dominate the planet s heat budget . tidal heating rises",
    "sooner and faster than the stellar insolation ( or `` instellation '' ) , exceeding the latter by about a factor of two for tens of millions of years , until just before the planet s demise .",
    "only as the inner planet nears the star does its eccentricity decrease enough for the tidal heating to decrease to near the instellation rate .",
    "the surface flux of internal tidal heat is orders of magnitude greater than that of io , so this 5 earth mass planet would undergo violent geophysical transformation during the last 20% of its lifetime .",
    "as shown in figure [ hata ] , the outer planet hat - p-15 b also experiences a boost in tidal heat generation . while the inner planet remains in orbit ,",
    "the outer planet s heating rate is boosted by 20% to a maximum over 20 @xmath54 , equivalent to @xmath109 total dissipation for @xmath110 1 gyr .",
    "tidal heating has been proposed as a possible energy source to explain some hot jupiters radius anomalies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "heating at a rate of @xmath111 within the past @xmath112 gyr might be adequate to have yielded the puffed - up radii @xcite and some hot jupiters might have been puffed up thanks to tidal heating @xcite . in general , a given warm jupiter ( such as hat - p-15 b at 0.1 au ) would have nowhere near enough tidal heat to explain a radius anomaly ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , with our hypothetical , now - defunct inner planet , the warm jupiter hat - p-15 b could have experienced considerably more heating during its history than if it had always been alone .",
    "while this value is very likely too small to have affected the planet s radius , it may have been great enough to have affected the internal physical processes of such a planet early in its history .",
    "more to the point of the current study , depending on the parameters of any particular system , a warm jupiter with a small inner companion that is either now lost to tidal evolution or too small to be detected , may have experienced heating great enough and recent enough to have detectable physical consequences .",
    "a systematic search for such conditions is left for future work .",
    "the consequences of multi - planet interactions on another warm jupiter s tidal heating history are discussed further in the section [ dampingheat ] .      in the above example",
    ", the inner planet s lifetime was very short , only a tenth of the estimated age of the system .",
    "however , a less massive inner planet might have survived the tidal evolution , even given its enhanced eccentricity driven by the outer planet , and still be in orbit around hat - p-15 .",
    "for example , by integrating backwards in time , we find that an earth - mass planet with @xmath113 could have started far enough from the outer planet to be stable , and also well inside the 3:1 resonance , and still be in orbit at 0.03au after about 6 gyr , comparable to the estimated age of the system .",
    "other examples are shown in figure 6 for various masses and current semimajor axes , all assuming @xmath113 for the inner planet .",
    "in fact , inner planets could still be in orbit having survived even longer then the durations shown in figure [ hatmany ] .",
    "if a planet formed outside the 3:1 resonance , but still far enough from hat - p-15 b that its initial orbit were stable , tidal evolution would have carried it into the resonance .",
    "it could then have jumped through the resonance .",
    "depending on the specifics of the resonance jump , particularly how it affected the eccentricities , this planet could have then continued migration and still be present in the system .",
    "the duration of evolution shown in figure [ hatmany ] only refers to the time after the resonance passage .",
    "thus the substantial mass and eccentricity of hat - p-15 b can not be assumed to have led to tidal removal of all inner planets .",
    "it is possible that the system still includes an inner planet of about one earth mass , or even larger if the system is younger than its estimated age .",
    "of course , this result depends on the assumed value of @xmath0 .",
    "a truly earth - like planet would have a much smaller @xmath0 and thus a shorter lifetime , but there is no reason to expect a planet so close to its star to have geophysical properties so similar to those of earth .",
    "next we consider how even a modestly sized inner planet can share the effects of tides in ways that significantly affect the outer planet , through the mechanism of secular interactions .",
    "thanks to tides , hot jupiters orbits may be more nearly circular now than in the past ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "warm jupiters , on the other hand , are generally too far out to have experienced significant direct tidal damping .",
    "however , even such warm jupiters may have had their eccentricities reduced from much larger values if a modest - sized inner planet had been present for part of the life of the system .    due to the secular coupling of the planets , the direct tidal action on the inner planet also would be propagated to the outer warm jupiter .",
    "as we have seen , eccentricity damping is shared among all the eigenmodes , so other planets than the one being directly affected by tides also experience eccentricity damping .",
    "thus , in general , planets exterior to an inner , tidally - worked planet may well experience significant eccentricity evolution even if they themselves are too far from their star to be directly affected much by tides .",
    "even if tides have already driven the inner planet in to the star , the remaining warm jupiter would have had a history that involved a much more eccentric orbit than we might imagine if we assume it was always single .",
    "such a history can be illustrated with the following example .",
    "consider the warm jupiter hd 130322 b with mass @xmath114 , current @xmath115 au and @xmath116 , and estimated age of @xmath1100.35 gyr ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "its radius is unknown , but we assume @xmath117 .",
    "it orbits a star of mass 0.79 @xmath118 and radius 0.83 @xmath119 .",
    "if hd 130322 b has been single since its placement close to its host star , integrating eqns [ adot ] and [ edot ] with @xmath0 values of @xmath120 for the planet and @xmath121 for the star , shows that this planet would have experienced essentially no eccentricity or semi - major axis evolution , as shown by the dashed lines on the right side of figure [ hd10a ] .",
    "now suppose hd 130322 b initially had an inner companion with @xmath122 , @xmath123 .",
    "now an entirely different orbital history can lead to the currently observed system , with the same orbit of planet b , and the hypothetical inner planet having fallen into the star ( figure [ hd10a ] , solid lines ) .",
    "here we have selected initial orbits that lead to this current configuration , and set the amplitude of mode 1 to zero because it would be very short lived .    in this scenario , the semi - major axis evolution of hd 130322 b ( figure [ hd10a ] , top",
    "right ) is nearly indistinguishable from that of the single - planet case , that is , there is almost no semi - major axis change .",
    "the eccentricity evolution , however , is quite different .",
    "indeed , the initial eccentricity of hd 130322 b with this modest - sized companion would have been 0.185 , more than four times its current value .",
    "implications for tidal heating ( bottom of figure [ hd10a ] ) are discussed in section  [ dampingheat ] .",
    "this dramatic difference in evolution in the multi - planet case versus the single - planet case is due to tides acting on the inner companion planet .",
    "in contrast to the example presented in section [ infall ] , the decrease in @xmath95 in this situation is not primarily controlled by the changing eigenvector @xmath103 ( which depends on evolution of the planets semi - major axes ) . instead , the eccentricity of the inner planet decreases due to decreasing @xmath74 ( a consequence of eccentricity damping ) , as well as the decreasing @xmath103 .",
    "indeed , @xmath124 is greater than @xmath125 for most of the inner planet s life , as shown in figure [ hd10b ] ( middle ) . only for the first 80 myr and last 20 myr does @xmath125 overcome @xmath124 .",
    "if the outer planet s eccentricity change were only due to the change of the eigenvector then its eccentricity would increase .",
    "as the inner planet s semi - major axis decreases , @xmath103 also decreases . because the eigenvectors are normalized , this means @xmath75 increases .",
    "however , @xmath74 is decreasing as shown in figure [ hd10b ] ( middle ) .",
    "like @xmath103 , the rate of change of @xmath75 is weak , too weak to overcome the effect of changing @xmath74 .",
    "hence the outer planet s eccentricity decreases along with that of the inner planet .",
    "the amount by which the eccentricity of the outer planet changes is affected by the mass and size of the inner planet . for tides raised on the star , @xmath126 so a more massive inner planet will tend to have faster evolution , a consequence of its greater ability to perturb the shape of the star . for tides raised on a planet @xmath127 , so the bigger the planet ,",
    "the faster the orbits evolve , unless the planet is extraordinarily dense .",
    "we can see how this manifests for hd 130322 by next considering a smaller inner planet with @xmath128 , @xmath129 and still with @xmath123 . in this case",
    "hd 130322 b s initial eccentricity could have been reduced from 0.65 before reaching its current value , simply by the presence of this now - lost inner planet .",
    "bear in mind that we selected an initial orbit for this inner planet that would maximize its lifetime , to maximize its effect on damping the eccentricity of the outer planet , before it itself disappears from the system .",
    "if the system s age were actually 0.75 gyr , the inner planet could have started at 0.035 au and still have had time to fall into the star recently . with that extra time",
    ", hd 130322 b s eccentricity could have been damped from an initial value of 0.138 to its current small value .",
    "comparing this case to the case shown in figure [ hd10a ] ( with a 10 @xmath130 inner planet ) , the inner planet goes though the same semi - major axis change and has a similar effect on the outer planet s eccentricity .",
    "thus , a 5 @xmath130 inner planet could have been about as effective as a 10 @xmath130 one if it has the extra time .",
    "while having an inner companion will always damp all the eigenmode amplitudes , some parameter space is more conducive for affecting the outer planet s eccentricity . to damp the outer planet s eccentricity",
    "at least one of @xmath74 and @xmath75 must decrease ( and if only one of those is decreasing its effect must be dominant ) .",
    "as the inner planet approaches the star , the greater separation between planets will slowly uncouple their interaction , meaning @xmath63 and @xmath75 will increase .",
    "so , to damp the outer planet s eccentricity , @xmath74 must damp . considering a case where the process is to run to completion ( i.e. the inner planet has time to fall all the way from wherever it started down into the star )",
    ", the effect can be maximized by having the rate @xmath74 decrease as fast as possible , while @xmath96 decreases as slowly as possible ( to maximize the amount of time the inner planet survives to get worked by tides ) .    as discussed in section [ secularplustides ]",
    ", we can ascertain what @xmath124 is compared to @xmath101 through the ratio @xmath61 ( eqn [ reldamp ] and figure [ damp1 ] ) . as shown in figure [ damp1 ] , for any given outer planet , larger values of @xmath96 and/or @xmath131 will result in stronger damping of @xmath74 compared to @xmath73 .",
    "however , while a larger @xmath96 will raise the rate at which @xmath74 damps relative to the rate a which @xmath73 damps , it will also decrease the absolute speed of @xmath74 damping due to the dependence of @xmath132 ( @xmath44 for @xmath133 ) on @xmath96 .",
    "this means that damping of @xmath74 will take longer for a larger initial value of @xmath96 .",
    "as discussed in section [ infall ] , a planet in either a multi- or single - planet system will live longer if its initial @xmath96 is larger .",
    "thus , a larger initial @xmath96 will ultimately lead to more damping of @xmath74 , and thus @xmath107 , if the process has time to run to completion .",
    "in addition to looking at what @xmath96 and @xmath131 will produce more damping on a given outer planet , we can also look at what role the inner planet s eccentricity plays .",
    "both @xmath134 and @xmath105 depend on @xmath95 , however @xmath105 has a @xmath135 dependence ( eqn [ adot ] ) , but @xmath136 ( eqn [ edot ] ) , and thus also @xmath134 ( see appendix [ appa ] ) , only depends on @xmath95 linearly .",
    "thus , at lower eccentricities @xmath105 will be comparatively weaker versus @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , an outer planet s eccentricity will be more strongly affected at low eccentricities .      the effect of an inner companion on the eccentricity of the outer planet leads to greater tidal heating of the outer planet than if that planet were alone . for hd 130322 b ,",
    "the 10 earth mass inner companion would for @xmath137 myr result in an order of magnitude greater tidal heating in the outer planet than if such an inner planet never existed ( bottom right panel of figure [ hd10a ] ) .",
    "the 5 earth mass planet results in about 3 times as much tidal heating of the outer planet compared to that outer planet being single . during this time the tidal dissipation rate is @xmath138 , half the heating rate for the outer planet in our hypothetical hat - p-15 system , and for only @xmath139 the duration ( c.f .",
    "section [ deathheat ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , this dissipation rate ( equivalent to @xmath140 ) could conceivably have played a role in the remaining planet s geophysical history , perhaps affecting the current physical properties .",
    "the sustained eccentricity of the inner planet results in great tidal heating of the inner planet .",
    "the 10 earth mass inner planet experiences tidal heating comparable to the instellation for most of its lifetime .",
    "the 5 earth mass planet receives only about an order of magnitude more heat from instellation than from tidal heat .",
    "( for comparison , earth receives about @xmath141 times more heat from the sun than from radiogenic sources . ) as for hat - p-15 the heating is thanks to the role of the outer one planet maintaining the inner planet s eccentricity , as well as the smaller values of @xmath0 that we have assumed for these smaller hypothetical planets .",
    "again , the tidal heat flux is orders of magnitude greater than that of io , so major geophysical processing would be expected .",
    "in section [ hatcompanions ] we showed that the hat - p-15 system could still include an earth - scale planet , even given the tidal migration toward the planet .",
    "for hd 130322 , the young estimated age of the system makes the survival of an inner planet possible for a much wider range of masses and current semimajor axes .",
    "as shown in figure [ hdmany ] , any planet with a mass up to 10 earth masses , or even more , could remain in orbit for much longer than the estimated 0.35 gyr age of the system , assuming @xmath113 .",
    "the overall pattern remains the same as for hat - p-15 b : higher massed companions evolve faster than lower mass ones .",
    "nevertheless for this system , tidal evolution can not rule out the current presence of an additional massive planet interior to the orbit of the known giant planet .",
    "for planetary systems that currently have more than one planet , consideration of possible orbital histories can place constraints on tidal parameters .",
    "as shown in sections [ infall ] and [ damping ] , where the inner planet experiences greater tidal evolution , the original orbits must have been much closer together .",
    "however , two planet systems are only stable if the planets come no closer than @xmath1102.5 hill radii from each other ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which places constraints on tidal parameters .",
    "consider the case of koi-543 , an unconfirmed system of two planets orbiting a star of radius @xmath142 , mass 0.85 @xmath143 , and age @xmath144 gyr ( @xcite ) .",
    "the planets have radii 1.42 @xmath145 and 2.29 @xmath145 , semi - major axes @xmath146 au and @xmath147 au , and periods 3.1 and 4.3 days , respectively .",
    "( note that here we number the planets in order of increasing orbital period .",
    "these planets have the reverse order in the kepler koi catalog . )",
    "we adopt masses of @xmath148 and @xmath149 based on the mass - radius relationship of @xcite .    because tides on both planets are important , and the planets have similar masses and tightly packed orbits ( such that @xmath106 and @xmath103 are not small compared to @xmath63 and @xmath75 ) , both eigenmodes damp on similar timescales .",
    "therefore , we assume that the two eigenmodes have equal amplitude at present .",
    "moreover , they damp much faster than the changes in semi - major axis .    assuming for simplicity that both planets have the same value of @xmath40 , if these were rocky planets ( with @xmath0 less than order of 100 )",
    ", the tidal damping would be extremely fast .",
    "even with @xmath150 , the damping timescale is only about 100 myr , as shown in figure [ k5431000a ] . for the evolution shown in that figure , we assumed current eccentricity eigenmode amplitudes of @xmath151 .",
    "figure [ k5431000b ] ( top ) confirms that the two eigenmode amplitudes damp on very similar timescales .",
    "figure [ k5431000b ] ( bottom ) shows that the planets minimum separation would have been only barely over the limit of stability ( 2.5 @xmath152 ) at 0.5 gyr ago .",
    "thus , given the estimated age of the system , unless the current eccentricities are extremely small , @xmath40 can not be less than 1000 .",
    "thus , if @xmath153 the current mode amplitudes can be no higher than @xmath151 unless some mechanism increased or sustained them .    for the case shown in figure [ k5431000a ] with both planets @xmath154",
    ", these planets experience extreme tidal heating .",
    "even with no instellation , for @xmath137 myr the internally generated tidal heat flux was two orders of magnitude greater than that of io .",
    "however , the tidal dissipation rate is quickly reduced as the tides also damp the eccentricities . at 0.5 gyr ago , the heat fluxes of about a couple hundred @xmath54 would yield a surface temperature of @xmath155 k from the stefan - boltzmann law .",
    "however , the instellation is much greater than the tidal heat flux , so the 250 k temperature would only be relevant to the night - side of the planets , and then only if the atmosphere was unable to distribute stellar heat globally .",
    "if both planets have @xmath40 of @xmath156 , which is more like that of saturn @xcite , then their eccentricities would have changed little over the past 0.5 gyr . with this @xmath40",
    ", the current eccentricity mode amplitudes could still be as high as @xmath157 .",
    "the tidal heat flux for the inner and outer planet are @xmath158 and @xmath159 for the entire 0.5 gyr .",
    "these heat fluxes are still somewhat greater than that of io , but the assumed @xmath0 of @xmath156 implies the planets would be gassy , so this heat flux might not have the same consequences as it does for rocky io .    based on their radii it is likely that the inner planet is rocky and the outer one has a significant gas envelope ( l. rogers , private communication ) .",
    "accordingly we consider a case where the outer planet s @xmath0 is @xmath120 , while the inner one s is @xmath160 . if both eigenmode amplitudes ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) currently have the same value , the largest they can be is @xmath161 . the evolution is shown in figures [ k543mixeda ] and [ k543mixedb ] .",
    "the first eigenmode damps to the current value about three times faster than the second eigenmode ( figure [ k543mixedb ] ) .",
    "thus , unlike the first two cases ( with equal @xmath0 values for both planets ) where the difference between maximum and minimum eccentricity changed on a timescale similar to the over - all damping of the planets eccentricities , in this case the difference between maximum and minimum eccentricity changes more slowly than the mean eccentricity does .",
    "this results in somewhat higher tidal heat flux for the inner planet than in the 1st case ( where both @xmath154 ) because , while the maximum @xmath2 of this planet behaves similarly in both cases , the average @xmath52 for the inner planet is higher in this case .    to summarize this section ,",
    "if both planets in this system have a @xmath0 typical of a rocky planet , their eccentricities should be very near zero .",
    "indeed , rocky planets typically have @xmath0 values smaller than the @xmath150 used in the first case presented in this section . however , if both planets have a @xmath0 more typical of a gaseous planet , then the planets could still have significant eccentricities . in the more realistic , 3rd case presented here",
    "( though again , we ve used a @xmath0 for the inner planet that is larger than expected for a rocky body ) , we again see that the current mode amplitudes ( and thus eccentricities ) must be small ( @xmath162 ) for the system to have been stable .",
    "it has long been recognized that the tidal damping of an inner planet s eccentricity can be counteracted by the effect of another planet . however , as demonstrated here , the interplay of gravitational perturbations and tidal evolution is more complicated than that , even where the perturbations are controlled by secular interactions alone , without the effects of resonances .",
    "a single warm jupiter would be too far from its parent star to have been directly affected by tides .",
    "however , with the presence of an additional inner planet , even one that no longer exists or is too small to be observed , the warm jupiter s tidal evolution and geophysical processing could be significant .",
    "we have seen how the reduction in the eccentricity of a warm jupiter like hat - p 15 b to its current value could have been doubled over its lifetime given the presence of a terrestrial - scale inner planet .",
    "but the small culprit would have vanished long ago , driven into the star by the combined effects of tides and planetary perturbations .",
    "hd 130322 b alone would have undergone negligible tidal evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "if its system initially included a small inner planet , its initial eccentricity could have been several times its current value , and its internal heating an order of magnitude greater for the first quarter of its life .",
    "the implication of these examples is that reliable inferences about the origin and evolution of a warm jupiter and its system are limited .",
    "its initial eccentricity after formation is poorly constrained , as is the corresponding amount of early internal tidal heating . moreover",
    ", the initial system may have contained more planets than currently observed",
    ". the tidal removal process may have been governed , or at least affected , the statistics of the multiplicity of planets in observed systems .",
    "the examples here also show how we can place constraints on the properties of the initial inner planet ( e.g. mass , semimajor axis , and @xmath0 ) from the current survival of an inner planet .",
    "in general , the smaller the mass of the inner planet , the more likely that it has survived to the present time ( figures [ hatmany ] and [ hdmany ] ) .",
    "but before its demise even a smaller one could have had significant effects on its accompanying warm jupiter . in any case , the lifetime of an inner planet can be dramatically shorter than it would be without the presence of the warm jupiter .    for the specific cases considered here , tidal heating of the warm jupiters , while greatly enhanced by the inner planet s presence , would not be great enough to yield an anomalously large radius .",
    "increasing the assumed size of the putative inner planet could enhance the heating further",
    ". on the other hand , a more massive inner planet would be less likely to be rocky , so its @xmath0 would be larger .",
    "such a planet would be less likely to have fallen into the star and more likely to be currently observable .",
    "classical secular theory provides insight into what parameters of the inner planet would maximize effects on the warm jupiter . for typical cases , including those examples in sections [ infall ] and [ damping ] , one eigenmode of the secular interaction dies out so quickly that the evolution is governed by only the single remaining eigenmode .",
    "tides damp the amplitude of that mode in proportion to the eccentricity values . however , the actual damping of the eccentricities depends on the eigenvector , which describes how the mode is apportioned between the two planets .",
    "the eigenvector depends on the semimajor axes and masses of the planets .",
    "these considerations help constrain the system parameters that may most effectively allow secular interactions to enhance tidal effects ( c.f .",
    "sections [ deathheat ] and [ dampingheat ] ) .    for systems currently with two planets , like koi-543 , the parameters that control tidal evolution can be constrained by the requirement that initially , i.e. at the conclusion of the formation process , the planets had to be sufficiently separated for the system to have been stable , such considerations can be used to place limits on the current orbital eccentricities , given reasonable estimates of planetary @xmath0 .",
    "such constraints are important for planets discovered by transits , where observations generally do not provide direct measurements of eccentricity , but planets are typically close enough to the star for tides to be important .",
    "although here we consider only examples of two - planet systems , similar types of the interactions and their effects on evolution and physical properties are to be expected in systems with three or more planets .",
    "for example , @xcite have recently shown that , in general , very close - in planets appear to exist only if the next outward planet is not too close .",
    "that observation is consistent with our demonstration that an inner planet tends to be driven into its star if its eccentricity can be maintained by another planet . in any system where there are significant tides on or by at least one planet",
    ", considerable care is required in order to infer the range of possible past evolution scenarios and initial state of the system .",

    "evolution of the rate of change of the amplitudes @xmath29 of the eigenmodes of a multi - planet system is straightforward if the change is due to a process that acts only to damp one or more of the planet s eccentricities .",
