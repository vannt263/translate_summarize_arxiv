    "one of the interesting properties of graphene is quantum hall effect ( qhe ) .",

    "the factor @xmath26 comes from the fourfold ( spin and valley ) degeneracy .",
    "furthermore , beacuse the states are shared by electron and hole at the zeroth landau level ( ll ) , the shift of @xmath27 occurs .",
    "in contrast , in the ab - stacked blg , within the two - band parabolic approximation , the hall conductivity was shown to be @xmath28 , where @xmath29@xcite .",
    "the zeroth and first landau levels are degenerate and hence the first quantum hall plateau appears at @xmath30 instead of @xmath31 .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed experimentally@xcite .",
    "qhe of the ab - stacked blg was also studied based on a four - band hamiltoian in ref .",
    "although ab stacking is predicted to be energetically favored over aa stacking in @xmath32 @xmath33 density functional theory ( dft ) calculations , the energy difference of about 0.02 ev / cell is small@xcite .",
    "moreover , lauffer _ et al .",
    "_ found that scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) images of blg resemble that of mlg , and hence they regarded it as a consequence of the blg confiquration being close to aa stacking@xcite .",

    "_ reported that in their high - resolution transmission electron microscope ( hr - tem ) experiments a high proportion of thermally treated samples are aa - stacked blg@xcite .",
    "these findings indicate the possibilty of fabrication of the aa - stacked blg .",
    "since the energy bands of the aa - stacked blg ( see fig .",
    "1c ) are different from both the ab - stacked blg and monolayer graphene , the quantum hall effect in the aa - stacked is expected to be quite different from that in the latter two systems .",
    "we have therefore carried out a theoretical study of iqhe as well as the longitudinal conductivity @xmath1 in the aa - stacked bilayer graphene using the kubo formalism . in this paper , we present a general analytical form of the hall conductivity [ @xmath34 as a function of both chemical potential ( @xmath6 ) and magnetic field ( @xmath35 ) of the aa - stacked blg .",

    "thirdly , we find that the @xmath48 ( the filling factor @xmath2 ) plateau across @xmath19 would disappear when @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and that a @xmath22-step at @xmath23 occurs while a zero - hall conductivity plateau disappears .",
    "interestingly , unlike the monolayer and ab - stacked bilayer graphenes , the aa - stacked bilayer graphene could display a unusual @xmath2 plateau even though it contains chiral quasiparticles .",
    "we argue that the occurrence of the @xmath2 plateau is due to the shift of level anomalies by the interlayer hopping energy @xmath7 .",
    "we first derive an effective four - band hamiltonian near each dirac point for the aa - stacked bilayer graphene in tight - binding aprroximation via @xmath49 expansion@xcite .",
    "we then diagonalize this hamiltonian to obtain the energy bands of the aa - stacked blg . in fig . 1",
    ", we display the energy bands of the mlg , ab - stacked , and aa - stacked blg together .",
    "we find that the energy bands of the aa - stacked blg are just two copies of the mlg band structure shifted up and down by @xmath7 , respectively .",

    "in addition , we note that a @xmath22-step occurs at @xmath192 for @xmath188 t and @xmath189 t. for @xmath183 t , all the lls are nondegenerate and hence all the steps are of the height of @xmath119 .",
    "however , if the @xmath186 and @xmath193 lls are degenerate at @xmath169 , a @xmath22-step appears at @xmath23 .",
    "this level degeneracy happens as the magnetic field @xmath194 , where @xmath195 .",
    "@xmath188 t and @xmath189 t fit the condition with @xmath190 and @xmath191 , respectively , and thus a @xmath22-step appears at @xmath23 .",
    "we also find that the disappearance of a zero - hall conductivity plateau is always accompanied by the occurence of a @xmath22-step at @xmath23 , because if @xmath20 , @xmath35 would satisfy @xmath196 with @xmath197 .",
    "interestingly , here we find that the structure of the hall plateaus of the aa - stacked blg would be significantly affected by the applied magnetic field , which is quite different from the mlg and the ab - stacked blg .",
    "in conclusion , we have calculated both the quantized hall conductivity and longitudinal conductivity of the aa - stacked bilayer graphene within linear response theory by using kubo formula .",
    "we find that the dependence of the hall plateau of the aa - stacked blg on the magnetic field is distinctly different from both the mlg and ab - stacked blg as well as the conventional quantun hall materials .",
    "in particular , the aa - stacked bilayer graphene could possess the unique @xmath2 plateau , in contrast to other graphene materials such as monolayer and ab - stacked bilayer graphene .",
    "the shift of level anomalies due to interlayer hopping energy is attributed to be the origin of the @xmath2 plateau .",
    "nonetheless , the @xmath2 plateau across @xmath19 would disappear if magnetic field @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , we find that the disappearance of a zero - hall conductivity plateau is always accompanied by the occurence of a @xmath22-step at @xmath23 . furthermore , when @xmath14t$ ] , the aa - stacked blg lacks the @xmath15 plateaus , which exist in the ab - stacked blg .",
    "we also find that when @xmath43 and @xmath198 , @xmath17 if the fermi level is not a few @xmath18s above and below a dirac point .",
    "this implies that at the high magnetic field , the external electric field can not drive any current for @xmath199 while the current would be perpendicular to the external electric field for @xmath200 .",
    "we hope that our predicted interesting characteristics of quantum hall effect in the aa - stacked blg , which are not seen in both the mlg and blg as well as the conventional quantum hall materials , would stimulate experimental effort on fabricating the aa - stacked blg and also on measurement of its transport property in the near future .",
