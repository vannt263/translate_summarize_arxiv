    "the extinction law measured from rcg colors turns out to be @xmath47 for the both fields and is different from the standard extinction law in the galactic plane @xmath48 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the similar analysis based on the _ j - k _ color - magnitude diagram also showed a strong difference between the measured extinction law in the axj1749.2@xmath02725 field @xmath49 and standard one @xmath50 .",
    "these conclusions are in agreement with results of @xcite , which demonstrated the significant difference of the extinction law in the galactic bulge and disk .    early type luminous stars with the magnitudes similar to that observed for the axj1749.2@xmath02725 counterpart would be located at the distance of the galactic center or larger .",
    "it is easy to show if we assume that the studied system is located at the distance of the galactic center and , consequently , has the extinction of @xmath51 . proposing the different classes of the stars as a companion of axj1749.2@xmath02725 we can obtain their apparent _ h _ magnitudes for the above mentioned distance and extinction . if this magnitude is higher than observed one , that the star of such a type should be located before gc , in the opposite case  behind it",
    "using the observed color of the axj1749.2@xmath02725 counterpart @xmath52 , and the extinction law measured from rcg colors above , we can estimate the extinction for these stars as @xmath53 .",
    "late type star with the same observed magnitude would be located at distance smaller than that of the galactic center and the standard extinction law should be used to estimate their extinction . in that case from the observed reddening @xmath54 we estimate the extinction @xmath55 .    in both cases",
    "the extinction is larger than that measured above using rcg in the galactic bulge .",
    "therefore , axj1749.2@xmath02725 should be located at larger distances , behind the galactic center . from the measured magnitudes of its counterpart",
    "we conclude that it should be earlier than b5 if a main sequence star is suggested . from the other side the main sequence star with spectral type earlier than b1 - 2",
    "would be located at the distance larger than 24 kpc , i.e. outside the galaxy ( fig .  [ fig : d_nh ] , left ) .",
    "this diagram shows the possibility of different classes of stars to be the counterpart of the studied source in the assumption of an appropriate absorption law . only stars placed on white fields of the diagram may be the counterpart of the source .",
    "if star is placed on the cyan field it means that : 1 ) it would be located before the galactic center , but the extinction would be higher than for the gc ; 2 ) it would be located behind the galactic center , but the extinction would be lower than for the gc . applying the similar reasoning for axj1749.1@xmath02733 we conclude that it is also located behind the galactic center and the type of its counterpart should be earlier than b3 and later than b0 for the main sequence stars ( fig .",

    "finally note , that giants with spectral types g5-k0 could also fit the observed magnitudes and colors of the counterpart of the sources ( fig .  [ fig : d_nh ] ) .",
    "this possibility does not looks very surprising taking into account a recent discovery of a new class of symbiotic x - ray binary systems , composed of a compact object , most likely a neutron star , accreting from the wind of an m - type giant ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however if we assume m0@xmath09 giants as the counterpart of studied sources , that axj1749.2@xmath02725 would be located at the distance of 40@xmath054 kpc and axj1749.1@xmath02733  at the distance of 30@xmath040 kpc , well beyond of the galaxy .",
    "based on the data of xmm-_newton _ and chandra observatories we significantly improved localizations and identified infrared counterparts for two x - ray pulsars axj1749.1@xmath02733 and axj1749.2@xmath02725 , located in the direction to the galactic center .",
    "it was shown that the extinction law towards the galactic bulge is significantly differed from the standard one . using this result we estimated the spectral class of the counterparts for both sources and concluded that they belong to the class of high mass x - ray binaries located behind the galactic center , presumably in one of spiral arms @xcite .",
    "most likely candidates to be counterparts seem to be the b3 star at the distance of @xmath56 kpc for axj1749.2@xmath02725 and the b3 star at the distance of @xmath57 kpc or the b1 - 2 star at the distance of @xmath58 kpc for axj1749.1@xmath02733 .",
