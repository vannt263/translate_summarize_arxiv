    "proving that proper quantum mover @xmath9 can not be implemented on a physical system s is equivalent to showing the following :    _ given @xmath21 there is no deterministic physical process @xmath22 which transforms an unknown pure vector @xmath0 of a generic hilbert space @xmath2 according to the mapping @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a pure state of @xmath2 depending on @xmath5 which satisfies the identity @xmath25 _ the adjective `` deterministic '' in the hypothesis plays an important role .",
    "on one hand it allows us to exclude from the analysis those processes which implement  ( [ thetra ] ) probabilistically , i.e. allowing some probability of failure . as in the case of the cloning and the u - not machines  @xcite",
    "such transformations are not prohibited by quantum mechanics and the above no - go theorem does not apply to them .",
    "in addition the term `` deterministic '' indicates that here we are considering scenarios where the output state @xmath26 associated with @xmath0 is uniquely determined : i.e. if we run the transformation many times on various copies of a certain input @xmath0 , the output state will be always the same vector @xmath26 .",
    "this point is important since the vectors @xmath26 which satisfy the property  ( [ unnot ] ) form a dense subset of @xmath2 . a transformation ( [ thetra ] ) which randomly picks up one of these @xmath26 is described by a @xmath3 map whose output state is not pure : these operations will be discussed in the next section where we will see that the possibility of implementing them depends explicitly on the dimension of @xmath2",
    ".    the most general deterministic physical transformations  ( [ thetra ] ) of the system s are the linear , completely positive , trace preserving ( lcpt ) maps @xmath22 which for all @xmath27 give @xmath28 with @xmath26 unit vector of @xmath2 such that eq .",
    "( [ unnot ] ) applies  @xcite . in the qubit case ( @xmath29 ) and for @xmath30 the impossibility of implementing the transformation  ( [ cpt ] ) can be established by considering the maximal fidelity achievable in performing an approximated u - not  @xcite .",
    "in fact , by expressing the trace of @xmath31 in the orthonormal basis @xmath5 , @xmath32 of @xmath2 we get @xmath33 the thesis then follows by observing that the left - hand side term of this expression is the fidelity of the output state of @xmath22 with respect to the orthogonal vector @xmath32 which according to  @xcite is upper bounded by @xmath34 .    the above argument does not apply if @xmath35 and for generic @xmath13 .",
    "one can still prove that no transformations  ( [ cpt ] ) exist by considering a unitary representation  @xcite of @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37\\ ; , \\label{cpt1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is a unitary operator acting on s and on an ancillary system a , while @xmath39 is a fiduciary state of a. according to eq .",
    "( [ cpt ] ) the pure states of @xmath2 are mapped into pure states of the same space , this implies that the state @xmath40 can not be entangled , i.e. @xmath41 with @xmath42 a pure state of a which , in principle , depends on the input state @xmath0 of s. by applying this relation to the unit vector @xmath43 , @xmath44 orthonormal states of @xmath2 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 complex such that @xmath47 ) and using the linearity of @xmath38 one gets @xmath48 with @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 defined as in eq .",

    "in particular @xmath49 and @xmath51 are , respectively , the _ unit vectors _ of @xmath2 which describes the outputs of the map @xmath36 associated with @xmath53 , @xmath54 : by hypothesis they satisfy the relations @xmath55 , @xmath56 for some phases @xmath57 and @xmath58 . by projecting the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ cpt3 ] ) on @xmath0 we derive the following identity @xmath59 which must hold for all the complex amplitudes @xmath45 and @xmath46 . one can verify that this condition is satisfied if and only if @xmath60 ( see appendix  [ appendixa ] for details ) . the impossibility of the transformation @xmath22 finally follows by observing that eq .",
    "( [ cpt11 ] ) is in contradiction with @xmath49 being a unit vector of @xmath2 .",

    "it should be stressed that the above derivation holds for all value of @xmath6 and for hilbert space @xmath2 ( also infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces ) .",
    "consider now the case of generalized quantum movers @xmath3 with not necessarily pure output states @xmath63 .",
    "these mappings include all those transformations which implement a proper quantum mover transformation  ( [ thetra ] ) probabilistically , i.e. where the output state is randomly selected among the set of the vectors @xmath26 which satisfies the condition of eq .  ( [ unnot ] ) .",
    "differently from the previous case , these generalized quantum movers are allowed at least for some restricted values of @xmath13 . what is more interesting is that the generalized quantum movers @xmath3 can be implemented by means of lcpt maps only if @xmath13 exceeds a threshold @xmath19 which explicitly depends on @xmath20 . here",
    "we provide both upper and lower bounds for this threshold , i.e. @xmath64 such bounds coincide for @xmath29 so that @xmath65 and the threshold of the qubit case is completely determined by the above inequalities . as in the case of eq .",
    "( [ ultima ] ) this is a direct consequence of the @xmath34 bound on the optimal fidelity associated with an approximate realization of a u - not  @xcite .    to derive the upper bound of eq .",
    "( [ uplow ] ) it is sufficient to provide a lcpt transformation that satisfies eq .",
    "( [ movers1 ] ) for @xmath66 . for instance",
    "let us analyze the linear mapping which takes any trace - class operator @xmath67 of @xmath2 to @xmath68 \\ ; \\openone \\ ; , \\label{esempio}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the identity operator of @xmath2 .",
    "the transformation @xmath70 belongs to the set of universal inverter super - operators that have been introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite in the context of entanglement criteria for bipartite systems .",
    "moreover , for @xmath71 eq .  ( [ esempio ] ) gives the approximated u - not mapping  @xcite which provides optimal output fidelity for @xmath29 and , in the case @xmath72 , provides optimal fidelity in the class of lcpt maps which are covariant with respect to arbitrary unitary transformations of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "one easily verifies that the transformation ( [ esempio ] ) satisfies the condition  ( [ movers1 ] ) for all  @xmath0 .",
    "however , it turns out  @xcite that the map @xmath70 is completely positive only for @xmath73 and this fixes the upper bound for the threshold @xmath19 .",
    "it should be stressed that in agreement with the no - go theorem on the deterministic quantum movers , the map @xmath70 of eq .",
    "( [ esempio ] ) transforms pure states of @xmath2 in mixed outputs .",
    "in fact , the purity of the output state is @xmath74 = \\left(\\frac{1-p}{d-1}\\right)^2 + p^2,\\ ] ] which is strictly less than @xmath75 for @xmath73 and @xmath76 .    to derive the lower bound of eq .",
    "( [ uplow ] ) assume that a lcpt map @xmath36 satisfying eq .",
    "( [ movers1 ] ) for all input states @xmath0 exists . by applying this relation to the vector of eq .",
    "( [ vettori ] ) we get the following equation @xmath77\\ ; , \\label{equazione}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath78 \\;.\\label{equazione1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again by requiring eq .",
    "( [ equazione ] ) to hold for all @xmath45 and @xmath46 we get the following constraints on the map @xmath36 which apply for all @xmath61 and @xmath44 orthonormal @xmath79 where we defined the quantities @xmath80 ( see appendix  [ appendixb ] ) . the previous equations can be supplemented by another constraint which can be obtained by applying @xmath81 to the entangled state @xmath82 and requiring its trace to be properly normalized to 1 [ in the above expression @xmath83 are orthonormal bases of @xmath2 and @xmath84 , respectively , and @xmath85 is the identity mapping on the ancillary space @xmath84 ] .",
    "this yields @xmath87 where we used the hypothesis  ( [ movers1 ] ) to write @xmath88 for all @xmath61 .",
    "equation  ( [ traccia ] ) can be further simplified by replacing the first relation of the system  ( [ equo ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath89 the lower bound of eq .",
    "( [ uplow ] ) finally follows by comparing this relation with the inequality @xmath90 , obtained by introducing a kraus decomposition of the lcpt map @xmath36 and applying the cauchy - schwarz inequality to the left hand side term  @xcite .",
    "we finally comment on the relations of @xmath3 with the u - not .",
    "one can easily verify that the set of the linear transformations which implement @xmath3 is closed under convex combination , e.g. given @xmath91 lcpt implementations of @xmath92 on s and given @xmath93 a set of probabilities , the transformation @xmath94 is a lcpt map which implements the generalized mover @xmath3 on s with @xmath95 being the average of the @xmath96 s .",
    "this observation allows us to establish that if the u - not could be implemented through a lcpt transformation , then convex combinations of such a map and the identity map will implement the @xmath3 for @xmath6 .",
    "in this last section we discuss an application of quantum movers in the context of entanglement witness . a central issue in quantum information is to determine whether or not a given density matrix @xmath97 of a composite system s+a is entangled .",
    "the identification of classes of impossible transformations can become a powerful tool in this respect  @xcite . in our case , one can construct a one parameter set of positive _ but _ not completely positive linear maps @xmath98 which implement the generalized quantum mover transformation @xmath3 on the system s. the presence of entanglement in @xmath97 will then be detected by looking for the presence of negative eigenvalues in @xmath99 for some values of @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , one can use @xmath13 as an effective `` measure '' of the entanglement in @xmath97 as one expects intuitively only highly entangled states to feel the non complete positivity of the transformation @xmath100 with @xmath101 . a suitable choice for the operators @xmath98 is obtained by adding to the transformations  ( [ esempio ] ) a linear term which gives null contribution to eq .",
    "( [ movers1 ] ) , e.g. @xmath102\\ ; \\openone + i [ \\lambda , \\theta ] \\label{newesempio1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath103 being a hermitian operator on @xmath2 . for",
    "the sake of simplicity let us consider the @xmath29 case where we can select @xmath104 with @xmath105 being the pauli operator along the @xmath106 direction . with this choice eq .",
    "( [ newesempio1 ] ) yields a mapping which , for all @xmath107 is positive but not completely positive ( this can be verified for instance by a direct inspection of the corresponding choi matrix  @xcite ) . as a test",
    "consider the set of werner states  @xcite @xmath108 which have concurrence  @xcite @xmath109 and are hence separable if and only if @xmath110 [ in the above expression @xmath111 is the singlet state ] .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath112 can be easily computed : three of them are always positive and the fourth is equal to @xmath113 for @xmath114 separable ( i.e. @xmath110 ) this quantity is positive for all @xmath13 .",
    "however for @xmath114 entangled ( i.e. @xmath115 ) @xmath116 is negative for all @xmath13 smaller than the critical value @xmath117 $ ] which monotonically increases with @xmath118 .",
    "as intuitively expected the more entanglement is in @xmath114 the more transformations @xmath112 are able to detect it .",
    "we have introduced a new class of impossible quantum operations , the quantum movers which include , as a special case , the u - not transformation of refs .",
    "we proved that it is not possible to transform an unknown state @xmath0 of a system s under the requirement that the final output configuration @xmath26 has a fixed ( non unitary ) component along the direction of the initial state . by relaxing the requirement on the purity of the final configuration of the system",
    ", there exists a threshold @xmath19 for the value of the input - output fidelity above which mixed quantum movers can be implemented .",
    "we related the movers to the u - not and we showed an application of these transformation in the context of separability criteria .",
    "the approach introduced in this work can be further extended .",
    "one can , for example , analyze the case in which the output fidelity of a quantum mover is bounded in a given interval , e.g. @xmath119 $ ] . moreover , as in the case of a u - not transformation",
    ", it may be interesting to analyze under which conditions the @xmath3 with @xmath13 below the threshold value @xmath120 can be realized approximatively .",
    "here we show that if eq .",
    "( [ cpt10 ] ) applies for all the complex amplitudes @xmath45 and @xmath46 then the constraint  ( [ cpt11 ] ) must be satisfied . for ease of notation",
