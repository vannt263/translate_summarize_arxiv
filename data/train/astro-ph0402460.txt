    "one of the observational tools available for the study of low - mass ( @xmath9 ) , metal - poor stars is the luminosity function ( lf ) of galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) .",
    "a ggc usually presents a large , chemically homogeneous , and coeval stellar population  samples of a kind that can not easily be extracted from halo field stars . in particular , the lf counts of evolved stars ( from the main - sequence turnoff to the tip of the red giant branch ) are directly related to the rate of nuclear fuel consumption @xcite .",
    "thus , a high - precision lf indirectly reflects interior stellar physics , and thus can complement observations of stellar surface conditions .",
    "previous lf studies of ggcs have given hints that non - standard physics might be required in the models .",
    "first , in the case of several metal - poor clusters an excess of stars on the sub - giant branch ( sgb ) has been noted . in a study that combined the lfs of m68 , ngc 6397 , and m92 , @xcite found an excess located just brighter than the main - sequence turnoff ( msto ) .",
    "a similar excess was also observed in m30 by @xcite and confirmed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "such an excess could be the result of enhanced energy transport in the cores of main - sequence ( ms ) stars nearing hydrogen exhaustion ( e.g. faulkner & swenson 1993 ) .",
    "to date excesses have only been seen in extremely metal - poor clusters and at low statistical significance ; the lfs of m5 @xcite and m3 @xcite did not reveal such excesses .",
    "second , studies by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have shown that there may exist an over - abundance of red giant branch ( rgb ) stars relative to the number of ms stars in some clusters .",
    "this may be indicative of physical processes such as core rotation @xcite and/or deep mixing @xcite .",
    "the observed lfs of other ggcs , however , have been argued to agree with theory @xcite .",
    "while the lf of m3 derived by @xcite is one of the largest to date , the study by @xcite has a smaller overall statistical significance due to the smaller overall star samples . in general",
    ", only thorough studies of large star populations in ggcs will help confirm or deny the reality of these kinds of excesses .",
    "a physical effect that is becoming part of standard stellar models is the gravitational settling of heavy elements @xcite .",
    "solar models show @xcite that helioseismic data and the inferred radius of the convection zone @xcite can only be matched by theory if the surface abundance of helium has decreased with time .",
    "stellar evolution models for low mass , metal - poor stars that include the effects of he diffusion have been previously constructed @xcite to investigate the observational effects on ggc lfs and color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) .",
    "one important result of these studies was that by adding he to the core of the stars , and consequently displacing h , the duration of the ms lifetime is shortened .",
    "this results in a lower msto luminosity for a given age and has strong implications for the derivation of ggc ages @xcite . using these diffusive models ggc ages",
    "may be reduced as much as @xmath10% ( @xmath7 gyr ) compared to models that do not incorporate diffusion @xcite , although the reduction could be as little as @xmath11% ( @xmath12 gyr ) depending on the presence of complete or partial ionization in the models @xcite .",
    "given the recent analysis of the wmap data from the cosmic background radiation , we now have a tight cosmological upper - limit on the age of the universe of @xmath8 gyr @xcite . as a consequence , theoretical stellar evolution models that do not include diffusion ( at least for he )",
    "may produce globular cluster isochrones that are too old .    in this paper we present @xmath3 photometric data derived from wide - field ccd photometry of the ggc m12 ( ngc 6218 , c 1644 - 018 ) .",
    "this bright , large , intermediate metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath13 ) cluster should provide an interesting comparison to other well - studied intermediate clusters such as m3 and m5 .",
    "m12 is also an extreme `` second parameter '' cluster [ @xmath14 ; @xcite ] .",
    "ground - based photometric data on m12 have most recently been presented by von braun et al .",

    "( 2000 ; hereafter r00 ) , and brocato et al .",
    "( 1996 ; hereafter b96 ) .",
    "space - based data on m12 was published by @xcite as part of a _ hst _ ggc snapshot survey .",
    "sato , richer , & fahlman ( 1989 ; hereafter s89 ) presented a deep cmd and lf for the inner regions of m12 , but to date no lf of the evolved stellar populations of m12 has been determined .    in this study",
    "we focus on comparing our data ( in the form of lfs and cmds ) to three sets of stellar evolution models . in @xmath15",
    "we discuss the observations , data reduction and photometry , photometric calibration , and comparisons to existing photometry . in @xmath16 , we present the photometry in the form of cmds and derived fiducial lines .",
    "@xmath17 discusses the cluster reddening , distance modulus , age , and metallicity which are the necessary input parameters to the comparison of the theoretical lf with the observed .",

    "observations for this study were done on the nights of ut date 6 may 1995 and 9 may 1995 using the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 0.9 m telescope . in total ,",
    "12 images were obtained in @xmath3 filters ( four images per filter ) .",
    "three images in each band were taken on night 3 ( 6 may 1995 ) of the run , with exposure times of 10 , 60 and 200 s. one additional 60 s image in each filter was obtained on night 6 ( 9 may 1995 ) of the run .",
    "seeing conditions were approximately 1@xmath215 on night 3 of the run and @xmath22 on night 6 of the run .",
    "all data were taken using a @xmath23 pixel ccd chip with a plate scale of 0@xmath2168 pixel@xmath24 , so that the total sky coverage was 23@xmath252@xmath2623@xmath252 around the cluster center .",
    "the frames were reduced in the standard fashion using iraf tasks and packages .",
    "the bias level was removed by subtracting fits to the overscan region and a master ` zero ' frame .",
    "both twilight and dome flat fields were used in constructing a master flat field frame from the high spatial frequency component of the dome flats and the low - frequency ( smoothed ) component of the twilight flats .",
    "the m12 profile - fitting photometry was performed using the daophot ii / allstar package of programs @xcite . in general ,",
    "about 120 stars were used to determine the point - spread function ( psf ) in each frame .",
    "stars were rejected as candidates for the psf determination if the fwhm of their profile varied by more than 3@xmath27 from the mean .",
    "the radial profiles of the remaining candidate stars were then examined individually to reject any stars that had nearby , faint companions .    in order to obtain a master list of stars for each frame , an iterative procedure using daophot s find routine and allstar was implemented .",
    "the final list of 17,303 stars in this study was determined from the master star lists of the three filters .",
    "this master list was used as an input to a final run of allstar to determine photometry from a consistent list of stars .",
    "the use of the allframe package @xcite did not provide a noticeable improvement of the photometry .",
    "observations of landolt standard fields and a number of cluster fields were made on night 6 of the run under photometric conditions .",
    "the standard star fields were observed at a range of airmasses in order to determine atmospheric extinction coefficients .",
    "we have chosen to use standard values from the extensive tabulation of stetson ( 2000 ) for the calibration because those standard stars have been shown to be accurately on the same photometric scale as the earlier landolt ( 1992 ) tabulation and because there is a large number of standard stars covering a larger range of colors .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on both standard and cluster frames using daophot ii using multiple synthetic apertures .",
    "growth curves were used to extrapolate measurements to a ( large ) common aperture size using the program daogrow ( stetson 1990 ) .",
    "the photometric transformation equations used in the calibration were @xmath28",
    "@xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are the observed aperture photometry magnitudes , @xmath34 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 are the standard system magnitudes , and @xmath35 is airmass .",
    "the transformation coefficients were determined using the program ccdstd ( e.g. stetson 1992 ) .",
    "while it was clear that higher order color terms would be necessary to adequately fit measurements of extremely red stars ( @xmath36 ) , we found that such terms were unnecessary because the cluster stars fell in a range of colors that was quite well fitted by linear color terms .",
    "our calibrated measurements for the standard stars are compared to the catalog values are shown in figure  [ primary ] .",
    "observations in each filter of the cluster fields were made on night 6 , and used to calibrate the cluster data .",
    "we selected 193 stars with relatively low measurement errors from the outskirts of the cluster as our local standards .",
    "these stars were generally on the asymptotic giant branch , upper rgb , or horizontal branch ( hb ) , and covered the entire range of colors for the cluster stars observed .",
    "we used the photometric transformations above to derive standard values for these stars .",
    "the calibrated secondary standard values were then used to calibrate the psf - fitting photometry .",
    "psf - fitting photometry from both nights of m12 observations were combined and averaged after zero - point differences between frames had been determined and taken into account .",
    "we then verified that the linear color terms derived earlier accurately corrected our data for color - dependent systematic errors ( see figure  [ secondary ] ) , and determined zero - point corrections for the photometry in each filter band .",
    "as a final note , we did not include the measurements of the brightest calibrated stars from the longest exposed @xmath0-band frames in order to avoid introducing systematic errors from non - linearity near ccd saturation .      in order to check the accuracy of our photometric calibration ,",
    "our data set was compared ( star - by - star ) to recent ground - based data from r00 , vb02 , and b96 .",
    "figures  [ compkasp ] and  [ comprosen ] show the @xmath37 , and @xmath38 photometric residuals ( our data minus theirs ) from comparisons with the vb02 and r00 studies , respectively .",
    "figure  [ compbrocato ] shows the @xmath0 and @xmath39 residuals from comparison with the b96 data . in table",
    "[ comp ] we provide the median values of these residuals , since this statistic is less sensitive to `` outliers '' than the mean .",
    "our data agree ( within reasonable errors ) with both the b96 and r00 data .",
    "the vb02 photometry is significantly faint compared to ours .",
    "because the median of the residuals ranges from @xmath40 to @xmath41 magnitudes , we also compare our data to the stetson ( 2000 ; denoted s00 in table  [ comp ] ) local standard stars in this cluster and show the residuals in figure  [ compstet ] . this comparison yields small median residuals showing consitent photometric calibration between this study , the stetson ( 2000 ) local standards , and the b96 & r00 data sets .",
    "the results of this @xmath3 photometric study are presented as cmds in figures  [ cmds ] and  [ cmdcutrad ] . the total sample of 17,303 stars measured in this study is shown in figure  [ cmds ] .",
    "given the lack of structure in the cmd beyond 8@xmath255 , in our final sample we ignored stars beyond this radius from the cluster center .",
    "figure  [ cmdcutrad ] shows the cmds of the cluster restricted to those stars located between a radius of 3@xmath254 and 8@xmath255 from the cluster center .",
    "we derive fiducial sequences for both the @xmath42 and @xmath43 cmds , and present the data in tables  [ bvfid ] and  [ vifid ] , including the number of stars @xmath44 in each bin used to compute the fiducial point . for the ms ,",
    "the fiducial sequence was determined by taking the mode of the color distribution in magnitude bins .",
    "the sgb fiducial points were also determined by finding the mode of the magnitude distribution in color bins because of the horizontal nature of the sgb in the cmd .",
    "the mean of the color distribution was used to compute fiducial points for the rgb .",
    "the mean of the distribution in a combination of color and magnitude bins were used to compute the fiducial points for the hb .    in figure",

    "their @xmath45 photometric study of m12 presents the only recent fiducial sequence available for comparison to our data set .",
    "we attribute the differences in the slope and offset of the ms fiducials to differences in the photometric calibrations , although this is difficult to verify since no other published study has done star - to - star comparisons with the s89 dataset .",
    "in this section we describe our method for the determination of four cluster parameters ( metallicity , reddening , distance modulus , age ) necessary to compare the theoretical lf to the observed .",
    "there have been a number of [ fe / h ] studies of m12 , and published values range over nearly @xmath46 dex .",
    "the two most widely used metallicity scales are those of zinn & west ( zinn & west 1984 ; zinn 1985 ; hereafter zw ) and carretta & gratton ( 1997 ; hereafter cg ) .",
    "zw cite a value of [ fe / h]@xmath47 .",
    "the cg scale ( based on high - resolution spectroscopy of ggc red giants ) gives [ fe / h]@xmath48 from the quadratic transformation of the zw scale .",
    "the discrepancy between the two scales is well - documented , with the cg scale giving a higher metallicity by approximately @xmath49 dex for low- or intermediate - metallicity clusters ( such as m12 ) and approximately @xmath50 dex lower abundances for metal - rich clusters .",
    "spectroscopic measurements of the infrared triplet of m12 red giants have been made by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite used these measurements to compute abundances on the zw and cg scales of [ fe / h]@xmath51 and [ fe / h]@xmath52 .",

    "for the remainder of this study , we only consider metal abundances of m12 between @xmath55}<-1.14$]@xmath56 , however , is used for some comparisons of our observations to the theoretical luminosity functions of @xcite .",

    "we adopt the reddening values as determined by vb02 .",
    "they note the lack of significant differential reddening across the field of m12 , and hence we do not use their maps to internally deredden our data .",

    "other measured values for the cluster reddening range from @xmath60 ( racine 1971 ; s89 ) . given the agreement between the vb02 and schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) studies , we adopt a value of @xmath40 as the uncertainty in the reddening .",
    "previous determinations of the distance modulus @xmath61 of m12 have yielded a wide range of values , from @xmath62 ( vb02 ) to 14.30 @xcite .",
    "even between studies that adopt similar techniques to find the distance modulus ( namely subdwarf fitting ) the results are not in agreement : the study by s89 finds @xmath63 but @xcite find @xmath64 .",
    "given that the overall uncertainty in previous distance determinations is inadequate to define a well - constrained range , we use the technique of subdwarf fitting to re - determine the distance modulus of m12 . because the data in this study are mostly drawn from the evolved stellar populations , our ms is not faint enough to be adequate for this fitting technique . to overcome this",
    ", we use the vb02 data which goes several magnitudes fainter and has a well - defined ms .",
    "fiducial points ( listed in table  [ vbfid ] ) for the main sequence were determined using methods identical to those described in @xmath16 , after correcting the data for the median offsets in table  [ comp ] . in order to minimize the possibility of systematic effects in the distance determination",

    "one can see ( not surprisingly ) that differences in input physics ( richard & vandenberg vs. bv ) and color transformations ( y@xmath96 g87 vs. y@xmath96 l98 ) both have a significant effect on the comparison of theoretical isochrones with observed fiducial lines .",
    "these differences are of comparable magnitude . as an example of the resulting problems , the choice in using the l98 or g87 color tables with the y@xmath96 models changes the implied age of m12 ( assuming the correct distance modulus ) .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ ageyy ] would imply an age of @xmath133 gyr using the l98 tables , while the right panel ( of the same figure ) would imply an age of @xmath134 gyr from using the g87 tables .",

    "the @xmath0 band lf does not depend on the @xmath6-color relations but only on the bolometric corrections .",
    "the various @xmath0 band distance moduli in figures  [ m12vblfv_cg]-[m12yylfi ] were determined via subdwarf fitting ( as in @xmath127 ) assuming the value specific to the metallicity used for the theoretical model .",
    "the theoretical lfs were normalized ( over a range of 0.3 mag ) to the total number of stars in the m12 lf sample at a point on the upper ms @xmath135 magnitude fainter than the msto . a mass function exponent @xmath136 ( where @xmath137 ) was selected as to match both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 band lfs at the faint end of the sample .",
    "this mass function exponent is in agreement with the one found by s89 .      as noted in the introduction",

    "given that we have eliminated the faintest stars ( @xmath138 ) in the core region of the cluster ( @xmath139 pixels = 2@xmath253 ) , it is unlikely that stellar blends can account for the discrepant sgb lf . to test this possibility , we computed the @xmath115 lfs for a restricted region of the data . after eliminating the core region ( @xmath140 pixels = 2@xmath258 )",
    "we found no substantial difference in the observed lfs , thus justifying our radial cut in the lf computation . in our examination of the sgb region of the m12",
    "lf we apply three different techniques in order to investigate the discrepancies between observations and theory :    * first we compare the theoretical and observed sgb lfs in an `` absolute '' fashion , using the values derived in @xmath17 for the cluster parameters . * second , we make the sgb lf comparison after performing a shift to bring a common point on the upper ms into coincidence .",
    "* third , we formulate a technique to maximize the exploration of the evolutionary timescales of the cluster stars by selecting theoretical models based on compatibility with the observed cmd .",
    "lastly , we construct the lf of m12 from the _ hst _ data of @xcite and compare this result with the lf derived in this study .",
    "in figure  [ sgbcompvabs ] we highlight the sgb and upper ms region of the m12 @xmath0 band lf with the same theoretical models from figures  [ m12vblfv ] and  [ m12yylfv ] .",
    "these comparisons use the parameters derived in @xmath17 , where the ages were adopted from the cmd analysis in @xmath57 .",
    "while the bv models appear to give the best overall description of the observed sgb region , this is only true if an older age ( or larger distance modulus ) is adopted ( as noted in @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) . in these `` absolute '' comparisons ,",
    "both the y@xmath96 models predict more stars than are observed in the sgb lf bins between the sgb `` jump '' and the msto .",
    "figure  [ sgbcompv2 ] shows the observed sgb region of the m12 @xmath0 band lf again , but here we use the second technique ( listed above ) for the comparison to theory .",
    "figure  [ sgbcompv2 ] also shows theoretical lfs for metallicities on both the cg and zw scale . in the theoretical models",
    "the sgb lf shapes are largely due to the choice of metallicity and age ; the strongest dependence is usually on metallicity @xcite .",
    "however , the choice of @xmath6-color transformations also has a noticeable impact on the shape of the theoretical sgb lf .",
    "the y@xmath96 model comparisons in figure  [ sgbcompv2 ] are identical except for the choice of color transformation table . because of the strong correlation between metallicity , distance modulus , and age we shift the magnitude scale ( of both the theoretical and observed cmds ) to bring a point on the upper ms into coincidence .",
    "we follow the method described by @xcite , using as reference the point on the upper ms that is 0.05 magnitudes redder than the msto magnitude . in this formalism , the distance modulus has been eliminated and hence the age and metallicity will be difficult to determine ( in an absolute sense ) in such diagrams @xcite . uncertainties in the zero - pointing could be as high as @xmath141 mag , mostly because the slope of the upper ms differs between sets of isochrones . from figure  [ sgbcompv2 ]",
    "we see that no choice of metallicity , color table , and model is able to completely describe the observed sgb lf .",
    "the bv and y@xmath96 models are able to match some points for a higher metallicity leaving other points lower than predicted , but a lower metallicity will mean other points are _ higher _ than predicted .",
    "using the y@xmath96 models , a better description of the sgb region ( that closely resembles the bv comparisons ) can be found if a slightly larger mass function exponent @xmath142 is adopted ( compare the sgb regions in figures  [ sgbcompvabs ] and  [ sgbcompv2 ] ) .",
    "systematic errors in the @xmath6-color transformations can lead to distortions of the theoretical isochrone in the observational cmd , and can thereby affect the theoretical lfs where the isochrone is changing most quickly in color .",
    "independent of that , the slope of the subgiant branch in the theoretical hr diagram is affected by cluster parameters like age and metallicity . in order to minimize systematic differences between theoretical and observed lfs , and to attempt to focus on the evolutionary timescales of the stars",
    ", we devised another method of making the comparisons . in this method , we selected the theoretical isochrone that best matched the observed cmd fiducial sequence _ when shifting the magnitude and color scales to match a point on the upper ms _ ( as described above ) .",
    "the theoretical model that best describes the observed cmd will be different depending on whether or not one performs this shift ( or uses the determined distance modulus and reddening ) . while this technique places significant weight on the ability of the @xmath6-color tables to correctly describe observations , it is unlikely that physical models will provide a good description of the observed lf if the theoretical and observed cmds do not match . in figure  [ age_all ]",
    "we show the observed m12 fiducial sequence with the bv and y@xmath96 models when shifting the color and magnitude scale . the theoretical model that best described the observations using the `` absolute parameters '' in  6.1 ( the _ dashed line _ in figure  [ age_all ] )",
    "is shown with another model that better describes the fiducial sequence when performing this shift ( the _ solid line _ in figure  [ age_all ] ) .",

    "while this throws some doubt on the ability of the g87 tables to match observed colors , this should be further investigated for other ggc cmd observations .",
    "the metallicities required for the bv and y@xmath96 models are within the range of m12 observations previously quoted (  4.1 ) , but the age of the bv model must be very large to match the shape of the sgb region of the fiducial line . using the `` best fit '' bv and y@xmath96 l98 descriptions ( from figure  [ age_all ] ) ,",
    "we show the observed m12 sgb lf with the theoretical lfs generated from these models in figure  [ sgbcompviso ] .",

    "neither set of models provides entirely adequate descriptions of the sgb region of the m12 lf . for the bv models ,",
    "the sgb evolutionary timescale is somewhat underestimated . for the y@xmath96 models , the numbers of stars in the two magnitude bins just brighter than the msto point",

    "both the bv and y@xmath96 models predict the presence of the rgb bump .",
    "the standard interpretation of the rgb bump is that it is due to the movement of the hydrogen burning shell through the chemical composition discontinuity left by the deepest penetration of the envelope convective zone @xcite .",
    "the y@xmath96 models show two peaks near the observed rgb bump , but the brighter of the two peaks is the true rgb bump .",

    "while this absolute comparison of the bump position disagrees with theory , recent work by @xcite has shown the bump position _ relative to the horizontal branch _ ( for their sample of 54 ggcs ) is in agreement with their most recent stellar evolution models .      because of the influence of cluster metal abundance on the sgb morphology , we compare the bv and y@xmath96 theoretical models to the lfs of three other well - studied ggcs . in doing this",

    "the magnitude scale was shifted to a common zero - point as described above to eliminate the sensitivity to distance modulus and age .",
    "while this comparison does present clusters having a wide range of central densities , there is no evidence for population gradients in normal clusters and some evidence for this effect in post - core - collapse clusters ( such as m30 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "given the radial cuts necessary to remove poorly - measured stars from the central regions of the clusters , the presence of crowding and possible population gradients should have a negligble influence on the shape of the cluster lfs .",
    "the plots indicate that the sgb region is also somewhat insensitive to metallicity except for filter choices which the cause the sgb to be nearly horizontal , as is the case for the @xmath34-band lf of m5 ( sandquist et al .",
    "1996 ) . in the case of m5 ,",
    "the y@xmath96 theoretical lf using the zw scale value is the most consistent with the observations .",
    "this feature might be exploited in future lf studies to help nail down the absolute metallicity scale . however , because the sgb is a feature primarily involving @xmath6 change , current uncertainties in the @xmath6-color transformations would have to be removed first .",
    "a comparison between the g87 and l98 tables for these clusters shows better agreement with observations when using the l98 transformations , as is also confirmed in comparing the middle and bottom panels of figure  [ sgbcompv2 ] .",
    "for all 3 clusters ( and for m12 also ) , the bv models are unable to match the sgb jump and hence we are unable to choose between metallicity scales using these models .",
    "though the zw scale is favored in these _ relative _ comparisons between theory and observations , in an _ absolute _ sense , the choice of the zw metallicity scale in the m12 analysis means that the determined distance modulus will be too small to match our lf observations .",
    "( this is consistent with the discussion of the cmd @xmath57 . )",
    "the zw scale implies that the use of an older model ( or larger distance modulus ) is necessary to match the cluster lf .",
    "we find that for a choice of [ fe / h]=-1.61 , the y@xmath96 models must have age of 15 ( using the l98 color table ) or 16 ( using the g87 color table ) gyr , respectively , to provide an adequate description of the m12 lf .",
    "to retain an adequate fit with a younger age of 13 gyr and metallicity [ fe / h]=-1.61 , the distance modulus would have to be larger that we determined by more than @xmath162 .",
    "this should once again emphasize the importance of renewed attention to @xmath6-color transformations .",
    "in this paper we have presented the @xmath115 luminosity functions ( lfs ) and @xmath3 color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of the galactic globular cluster ( ggc ) m12 from wide - field ccd photometry . given constraints on the cluster age , metallicity , distance modulus , and reddening we compare our data to three sets of theoretical stellar evolution models for metal - poor , @xmath5-enhanced , low mass stars .",
    "we find that neither the @xcite nor the @xcite models are able to adequately describe the sgb region of the m12 lf . while we find no statistically significant excesses of stars , the observed sgb lf has a noticeably different slope than predicted .",
    "we find the theoretical description of the sgb region of the cluster lf to be sensitive to the selection of color-@xmath6 transformations , and to a lesser degree to age and metallicity . on the other hand",
    ", we find agreement between the observed and predicted numbers of ms - to - rgb stars ; m12 does not appear to have an excess of rgb stars compared to theory . in the context of",
    "the langer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) claim that extremely blue ( `` second parameter '' ) clusters are explained by deep mixing ( during the rgb phase ) and resulting envelope helium enrichment , the m12 lf should have shown this rgb excess .",
    "in contrast to this , we find the lf to be similar to that of m3 [ @xmath163 ; lee et al.(1994 ) ] , another cluster of nearly identical metallicity that does not shown an excess of rgb stars .",
    "we find in our analysis that regardless of the differences in input physics in these two models , the adoption of the zw metallicity scale is incompatible with observations . assuming a metallicity for m12 on the zw scale , adequate theoretical description of both the cmd and lf data would require either ( 1 ) a model older than recent estimates of the age of the universe ( see below ) , or ( 2 ) a distance modulus that would be @xmath126 larger than we determined from subdwarf fitting .",
    "analysis of the wmap experimental data @xcite has now placed new restrictions to the age of the universe , and hence the possible ages of ggcs .",
    "taking into account a ggc formation timescale of @xmath135 gyr this implies that the possible ages of ggcs can be no larger than @xmath134 gyr .",
    "we find that the models of @xcite require the use of a 16 gyr model in order to account for the observed properties of the m12 lf given the metallicity of m12 on the zw scale .",
    "a 14 gyr model would provide a similar fit but require the use of a distance modulus that is @xmath164 greater ( just above our @xmath116 error ) than the value we derived from subdwarf fitting . while comparisons between observations and the models of @xcite have been shown to prefer the zw metallicity scale @xcite , use of the cg scale with these models still implies an age for m12 of 13 - 14 gyr . in contrast , the theoretical models of @xcite and @xcite imply a cluster age of @xmath131 gyr given the metallicity of m12 on the cg scale , in better agreement with the wmap upper limit .",
    "we attribute this to the use of he diffusion and gravitational settling ( only vandenberg et al . 2002 ) , although uncertainties due to color-@xmath6 transformations are still of comparable importance .",
    "previous work ( see @xmath132 ) has already shown the input of diffusion tends to reduce the cluster ages by @xmath165 gyr , and therefore provides the simplest explanation of our observations . clearly for gravitational settling to become a necessary part of stellar evolution models , confirmation of this age reduction and consistency with lf observations will be needed for other clusters . as a consequence",
    ", the reduction of systematic errors in the distance modulus determination ( and therefore cluster metallicity and reddening ) will be crucial to this analysis @xcite .",
    "further observations of stellar surface conditions , such as the @xmath166li spite plateau @xcite and metal abundance variations in the ggc evolved populations , will also help to place crucial constraints on gravitational settling as well @xcite .",
