    "the sequencing of the human reference genome , announced ten years ago , provided a roadmap that is the basic foundation for modern biomedical research @xcite .",
    "this monumental achievement was enabled by developments in dna ( homopolymer ) sequencing technology that allowed data production which exceed the original descripion of sanger sequencing @xcite .",
    "linear polymers are the simplest physical systems that can be studied in the framework of random walks models .",
    "they are long chain - like molecules formed by repetition of a basic unit or segment , where more importantly the polymer is _ flexible _ , i.e. , it can assume different geometric configurations .",
    "recently , the study of homopolymers has been established by various techniques in condensed matter physics .",
    "@xcite , studied the behavior of single file translocation of a homopolymer through an active channel under the presence of a driving force by using langevin dynamics simulation .",
    "previous works on homopolymers which studied the denaturation of circular dna are extensions of the poland - scheraga model @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the viscoelastic properties of a binary mixture of a mesogenic side - chain block copolymer in a low molecular weight nematic liquid crystal are studied for mass concentrations ranging from the diluted regime up to a liquid crystalline gel state @xcite .",
    "although monte carlo simulations play an important role for the study of phase transitions and critical phenomena , some well - known difficulties arise when one uses standard algorithms ( one - flip algorithms ) @xcite for the study of random walks models .",
    "these difficulties have been overcomed by the development of alternative monte carlo methods , such as parallel - tempering @xcite , cluster algorithms @xcite , multicanonical algorithms @xcite , and more recently the wang - landau method @xcite .",
    "this method has been applied with great success to many systems , in particular to polymers in lattice @xcite .    in the present paper , using the wang - landau method , we investigate the computer simulations of a homopolymer model with exact solution in canonical and microcanonical formalism . in section [ models ]",
    "we give an introduction to the three studied models and we briefly present the mathematical background . in section [ simulations ]",
    "we outline shortly how the simulations were carried out . in section [ results ]",
    "we show and discuss the results for all the models .",
    "we consider a homopolymer chain of @xmath0 monomers units of length @xmath1 which may assume any configuration on a two - dimensional latice @xcite .",
    "one end of the polymer is fixed and its taken as the origin of coordinates , shown by an open circle in figure [ model ] , a ) .",
    "the other end of this linear chain is subject to an externally applied tension @xmath2 , acting along the positive @xmath3-axis .",
    "a possible realization of this model is sketched in figure [ model ] , a ) .",
    "each polymer unit is permitted to lie either parallel or antiparallel to the @xmath3-axis and we assign the works @xmath4 and @xmath5 to these two orientations .",
    "we denote by @xmath6 the distance between the ends of the polymer chain , on the @xmath3-direction .",
    "each monomer unit has the additional possibility of lying perpendicular to the @xmath3-axis , in the @xmath7 or @xmath8 directions .",
    "we associate a positive energy @xmath9 to such a perpendicular monomer and the distance between the ends of the chain on the @xmath10-direction is denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the number of monomers along the @xmath15 and @xmath16 directions respectively , and similarly for @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "since the tension in the @xmath10 direction is zero , we can assume @xmath19 .",
    "then @xmath20    @xmath21    @xmath22    from which we find    @xmath23    @xmath24    and    @xmath25    the number of configurations of the polymer consistent with a given end - to - end distance in the @xmath3-direction , @xmath26 ( the dimensionless length of the polymer ) , and @xmath27 ( the number of monomers lying perpendicular to the @xmath3-axis ) , is    @xmath28    from eq .",
    "( [ h_1 ] ) , if we set @xmath29 , we can write for a given energy level    @xmath30    and from eq .",
    "( [ n_1 ] ) @xmath31    adding the equations ( [ e_1 ] ) and ( [ n1_1 ] ) we obtain @xmath32    inserting eqs .",
    "( [ nx_1 ] ) , ( [ nx1_1 ] ) and ( [ ny_1 ] ) into ( [ omega_1 ] ) , using eqs .",
    "( [ e_1 ] ) , ( [ n1_1 ] ) , and ( [ u_nx_1 ] ) , and setting @xmath33 we obtain the number of configurations with energy @xmath34 as    @xmath35    using the definition of the entropy and defining @xmath36 , we obtain @xcite :    @xmath37      in this model we consider that each polymer unit is parallel to the @xmath3-axis ; no antiparallel move is allowed .",
    "additionally the polymer units have the possibility of lying on the @xmath7 and @xmath8 directions . in figure [ model ] b ) is sketched a possible configuration of this model , where we depicted by an impenetrable wall the forbidden region along the @xmath3-axis .",
    "the hamiltonian for the model @xmath38 can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the number of monomers along the @xmath15 direction and similarly for @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "assuming again @xmath43 we obtain the following equations :    @xmath44    and    @xmath45    for this model the number of configurations of the polymer consistent with a given @xmath26 and @xmath27 is    @xmath46    from eq .",
    "( [ h_2 ] ) , if we set @xmath29 , we can write the energy as    @xmath47    and for @xmath48 we obtain @xmath49    after similar calculations as for model @xmath50 , subsection [ model1 ] , we obtain the density state and end - to - end distance per monomer , respectively    @xmath51    and @xmath52      in this model we consider that each polymer unit is parallel to the @xmath3-axis and we allow only the possibility of lying on the @xmath7 direction .",
    "thus , we restrict to the situation of positive values for both axes . in figure [ model ] c ) we show a possible configuration of this model .",
    "the hamiltonian for the model can be written as @xmath53 where @xmath40 is the number of monomers along the @xmath15 direction and similarly for @xmath41 . then    using the method previously described",
    ", we obtain @xmath40 and @xmath41 for this model    @xmath54    and @xmath55    for this model the number of configurations with energy @xmath34 is given by    @xmath56    using the equation for @xmath57 we obtain the length of the polymer as    @xmath58",
    "in our simulations we followed the prescriptions of ref .",
    "we define a monte carlo step ( mcs ) as giving sequentially to any unit the possibility of changing its direction with identical probability to any allowed direction or remaining in the same one . at the beginning of the simulation we set @xmath59 for all energy levels , where @xmath60 .",
    "the random walk in the energy space runs through all energy levels from @xmath61 to @xmath62 with a probability @xmath63,1\\right\\rbrace , \\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath64 are the energies of the current and the new possible configurations .",
    "after @xmath0 trial moves we update @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( where @xmath70 is the so - called modification factor and @xmath71 is a histogram accumulated for each @xmath72 ) . the flatness of the histogram is checked after a number of monte carlo ( mc ) steps and usually the histogram is considered flat if @xmath73 , for all energies , where @xmath74 is an average over the energies .",
    "if the flatness condition is fulfilled we update the modification factor to a finer one and reset the histogram @xmath75 .",
    "the simulations are continued up to @xmath76 and the microcanonical averages were accumulated from the very beginning ( @xmath77 ) , results obtained by ferrera and caparica @xcite . having in hand the density of states , one can calculate the canonical average of any thermodynamic variable as    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the microcanonical average accumulated during the simulations and @xmath80 , @xmath81 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath82 is the temperature .",
    "in figure [ model ] we depicted the three models which were presented in section [ models ] .",
    "the difference between the models is given by the allowed moves .",
    "in the first model , denoted by a ) in the figure , we allow the polymer unit to move along the positive or the negative directions of the @xmath3-axis , the same for the @xmath10-axis .",
    "the end - to - end distance of the polymer on @xmath3-direction is denoted by @xmath6 and with @xmath11 we denote this distance on @xmath10-direction . in the second model , b ) in figure [ model ] , the antiparallel motion along the @xmath3-axis is forbidden . in the third considered model there",
    "are allowed moves only on the positive side of both @xmath3 and @xmath10-axis .    using the simulated and the exact density of states in eq .",
    "we calculate the specific heat given by @xmath83 and the mean end - to - end distance @xmath84 where @xmath34 is the energy of the configurations and @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the corresponding @xmath3-coordinates of the ends of the polymer .    in figure",
    "[ ge ] we plot in semi - logarithmical scale the density of states @xmath57 for all the three models . here",
    "we plot the results obtained from the simulations ( symbols in the figure ) and also the exact theoretical results ( continuous lines in the figure ) for a polymer of @xmath87 monomers . in figure [ lx ]",
    "we plot the end - to - end distance along the @xmath3-axis , @xmath6 , as a function of the temperature . here",
    "we rescale @xmath6 by the total number of monomers , @xmath87 in this case .",
    "we observed a very good agreement between the simulation results ( symbols in the figure ) and the theoretical results ( continuous lines in the figure ) , given by equations ( [ lxn_1 ] ) , ( [ lxn_2 ] ) , and ( [ lxn_3 ] ) , corresponding to model @xmath50 , model @xmath38 , and model @xmath88 respectively . in figure [ cv ]",
    "we plot the specific heat per monomers for polymers with @xmath87 .",
    "the specific heat have a tail proportional to @xmath89 in the high temperature limit .    finally , in table i we present the location of peak of the specific heat for each model obtained by the wang - landau simulations and compare with the results calculated with the exact density of states .",
    "the simulations were carried out for 100 independent runs , adopting the @xmath90 flatness criterion .",
    "one can see that in the three cases the exact results fall into the error bars .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     * table i : * _ temperatures of the peak of the specific heat from simulations , compared with the exact values . _",
    "we have carried out wang - landau simulations of a simple polymer model which has exact solutions in both the microcanonical and the canonical ensembles .",
    "here we considered three two - dimensional models : in the first model we allowed moves in all possible directions , in the second model the moves along the negative @xmath3-axis are forbidden , while in the last model we allowed only moves along the positive direction for both @xmath3 and @xmath10- axis .",
    "we have shown that updating the density of states only after each @xmath0 trial moves and halting the simulations when @xmath76 @xcite , defined during the simulations , we obtain quite accurate results , compared with the available analytical exact results .",
    "we have obtained a very good agreement between the simulations and the exact results also for the studied physical quantities : the end - to - end distance and the specific heat . as expected , due to the difference of the allowed directions of motion , in the limit of high temperatures",
