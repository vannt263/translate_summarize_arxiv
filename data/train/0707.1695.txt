    "a key challenge in the study of galaxy formation is to explain the emergence and build - up over cosmic history of the tight red sequence of non - star - forming galaxies , especially in the richest environments . at the present epoch ,",
    "red sequence galaxies account for some 50 per cent of the total stellar mass ( e.g. bell et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the evolution of the red galaxy luminosity function provides a direct probe of the mass - assembly history of the red sequence .",
    "recent surveys suggest growth in the red sequence mass by factors of 23 since redshift @xmath13 , dominated by galaxies with relatively low luminosity ( @xmath14 ) , while the most luminous red galaxies show little number evolution over the same interval ( e.g. bell et al . 2004 ; faber et al .",
    "2005 ; bundy et al .",
    "2006 ; wake et al .",
    "2006 ; brown et al . 2007 ; scarlata et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the history of star formation is in general distinct from the mass - assembly history of the galaxies , since dissipationless ( ` dry ' ) mergers of gas - poor systems merely redistribute existing stars ( e.g. van dokkum 2005 ) .",
    "faint field - galaxy surveys reaching to high redshifts reveal that star formation has shifted from high - mass galaxies in the past to being preferentially active in low - mass systems today , a trend referred to as ` downsizing ' ( e.g. cowie et al .",
    "1996 ; juneau et al . 2005 ) .    in galaxy clusters ,",
    "the butcher  oemler effect ( butcher & oemler 1984 ) constituted some of the earliest evidence for the recent rapid growth in the red sequence : a population of blue star - forming galaxies existed in some rich clusters at @xmath15 which is apparently absent at the present day , having presumably faded into the quiescent population in the intervening @xmath33gyr .",
    "rapid evolution in luminosity - selected studies is driven largely by a decline in low - mass star - forming galaxies , which fade onto the faint end of the red sequence ( e.g. holden et al .",
    "after star - formation is ` quenched ' , especially if the remaining gas was consumed in a rapid starburst , the transformed galaxies may pass through a k+a phase ( e.g. dressler & gunn 1983 ; couch & sharples 1987 ) .",
    "the characteristic mass scale of k+a galaxies is observed to be larger at high redshift ( e.g. tran et al .",
    "2003 ) than in local clusters ( e.g. poggianti et al . 2004 ) , a manifestation of downsizing in the formation of the red sequence itself .",
    "many recent studies suggest that distant clusters are deficient in faint red galaxies , relative to local analogues ( e.g. kodama et al .",
    "2004 ; de lucia et al .",
    "2004 , 2007 ; muzzin et al . 2007 ; stott et al .",
    "2007 ) , as expected if many of today s faint red sequence galaxies were indeed star - forming at look - back times above a few gyr ( but see andreon 2006 for contrary evidence ) .",
    "if the present day red population is compared naively to the galaxies already on the red sequence at high redshift , we inevitably find only modest evolution the stellar populations ( the so - called ` progenitor bias ' ) , since we are not comparing to the full progenitor set ( e.g. kaviraj et al .",
    "none the less , recent studies of the red - sequence scaling relations , such as the fundamental plane , indicate a faster evolution in the stellar populations of lower luminosity galaxies , again consistent with the downsizing scenario ( e.g. jrgensen et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "an alternative means of probing the build - up of the quiescent population is to measure explicitly the stellar population ages of galaxies on the red - sequence at the present day .",
    "a mass dependence in the quenching times should show up in the current ages of galaxies , so long as the latter are not _ in general _ contaminated by ongoing or renewed star - formation significantly after the primary quenching event .",
    "( this assumption might be better justified in cluster environments than in the low - density field where rejuvenation through mergers could be more common . )",
    "determining the average stellar ages of galaxies from their integrated light is fraught with difficulties , from the classic age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy ( e.g. worthey 1994 ) to the presence of non - solar abundance ratios ( e.g. worthey , faber & gonzlez 1992 ) and the confounding effects of composite stellar populations ( e.g. serra & trager 2007 ) .",
    "despite these challenges , modern spectral synthesis models , notably those of worthey ( 1994 ) and thomas and collaborators ( thomas , maraston & bender 2003 ; thomas , maraston & korn 2004 ) , have enabled great progress in separating the effects of age , metallicity and abundance ratios on the principal spectral lines .",
    "( while we will focus here on line - index methods , we note that heavens et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have developed an alternative , ` full - spectrum ' , method to constrain star - formation histories from the present - day galaxy population . )",
    "many studies have employed these and similar models to analyse modest samples of low - redshift galaxies , mostly corresponding to giant elliptical and s0 galaxies .",
    "we highlight here only a selection of notable work .",
    "kuntschner ( 2000 ) concluded that fornax cluster ellipticals form a metallicity sequence at constant ( old ) age , while s0s in fornax show a wider age spread .",
    "trager et al .",
    "( 2000b ) recovered a wide spread in ages , with an age ",
    "metallicity anti - correlation maintaining the tight broad - band colour  magnitude relation .",
    "they show a tendency for younger ages at lower @xmath1 , at least for galaxies outside of rich clusters .",
    "more recently thomas et al . (",
    "2005 ) compiled data from a number of sources for @xmath3200 galaxies , arguing for a fairly shallow age  mass relation ( although this conclusion was reached after excluding some young low - mass objects from their fits ) .",
    "complementary to these high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) studies of small galaxy samples , a number of works have used spectroscopic surveys of thousands of galaxies to extract the age - mass relations for red galaxies , although with lower typical s / n per galaxy . among these , nelan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , working from the red - sequence - selected noao fundamental plane survey ( nfps ) , strongly confirmed the earlier hints at an age ",
    "mass trend , with age@xmath16 ( see also smith et al .",
    "subsequently , similar trends were obtained by selecting red and/or early - type galaxy samples from the sdss : bernardi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) recovered age@xmath17 ( depending on which age estimator is used ) , while clemens et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found age@xmath18 ( our estimate from their figure 10 ) .",
    "although these surveys suggest an emerging consensus on the existence of the age ",
    "mass relation , there are still some apparently contradictory results . for instance , snchez - blzquez et al .",
    "( 2006b ) report uniformly old ages in their sample of @xmath320 coma ellipticals ( including five galaxies with @xmath19 ) , although their virgo and ` field ' samples show a trend with age@xmath20 .",
    "it is possible that different selection methods , in particular colour selection versus detailed visual morphological inspection , are at the root of these differences .    given the strong intermediate - redshift evidence for downsizing and the mass - dependent build - up of the red sequence , there is a pressing need to determine present - day galaxy ages over a wide mass baseline . among the studies described above , however ,",
    "most are limited to galaxies near the break in the luminosity function , @xmath21 .",
    "for example , the median velocity dispersion , @xmath1 , is @xmath3200  for the sdss - based studies ( bernardi et al .",
    ", clemens et al . ) , and for the thomas et al . compilation ( which includes only four galaxies with @xmath22 ) .",
    "the nfps is somewhat better in this regard , with median @xmath1 around 150 , but the s / n achieved on individual galaxies is sufficient only to determine an average age at low mass . to trace the build - up of the red sequence since @xmath23 , where the activity is mostly in faint galaxies",
    ", it is necessary to extend the sampling to still lower @xmath1 , while maintaining high spectral s / n ( required for reliable age measurements ) , and samples of meaningful size and reproducible selection criteria . a first step towards this goal",
    "was made by mobasher et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in their survey of coma cluster members , extending to low luminosities . however , the resolution of this survey was not sufficient to measure velocity dispersion to act as a mass proxy , and the s / n ( per angstrom ) was too low to determine meaningful ages for individual galaxies in the fainter part of the sample . using the mobasher et al . data , poggianti et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found only a very weak dependence of age on luminosity , and a very wide spread in age at all luminosities .",
    "caldwell , rose & concannon ( 2003 ) made a higher - resolution and higher - s / n study of 175 galaxies ( many in virgo ) , with 40 galaxies in the regime @xmath24 , recovering a trend of age@xmath18 .",
    "more recently , matkovi & guzmn ( 2005 ) have observed @xmath390 galaxies in coma , including 37 galaxies with @xmath22and @xmath25per angstrom .",
    "this sample appears to follow an age ",
    "mass relation with a similar slope to the nelan et al .",
    "result ( matkovi , private communication ) .",
    "finally , two studies of true dwarf galaxies illustrate the wide range in properties which perhaps co - exist in the low - luminosity population : geha , guhathakurta & van der marel ( 2003 ) observed 17 virgo dwarf ellipticals ( des ) with @xmath26 , and obtained an average age of @xmath35gyr . at the other end of the surface - brightness scale , a sample of six ultra - compact dwarfs in virgo , also with @xmath27 , yields ages of @xmath28gyr ( evstigneeva et al .",

    "this paper presents the first results from deep observations of galaxies in the shapley supercluster with the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) .",
    "the objective is to investigate the not only the mean scaling relationships but also the intrinsic scatter in the stellar population parameters , their correlation structure , and their dependence on luminosity , morphology and environment .",
    "particular emphasis will be placed on the faint red - sequence galaxies , which are expected to have experienced the most recent truncation events .",
    "such an analysis requires age and metallicity measurements for hundreds of individual galaxies , spanning a wide range in mass , and reaching the level of precision so far achieved only for small samples of high - mass objects .",
    "the shapley supercluster ( proust et al . 2006 and references therein ) , is an ideal target for such a campaign , since it provides an exceptional density of galaxies and clusters within a few square degrees on the sky .",
    "the angular scale of the supercluster and the density of feasible targets are well matched to the two degree diameter field of the aaomega fibre - fed spectrograph ( sharp et al .",
    "2006 ) . for a sample with these characteristics , aaomega delivers a larger multiplex advantage than any instrumentation available on larger telescopes .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : observe ] we describe the sample selection ( [ sec : photom ] ) , the spectroscopic observations and data reduction ( [ sec : specobs ] ) , and measurements of redshift and velocity dispersion ( [ sec : sigmas ] ) , emission line equivalent widths ( [ sec : emissmeas ] ) , and absorption line indices ( [ sec : indices ] ) . in section  [ sec : emlines ]",
    "we present statistics of objects showing significant emission lines .",

    "a comparison of these results to previous work is made in section  [ sec : otherwork ] , and the the main conclusions reviewed in section  [ sec : concs ] .    in a companion paper ( smith , lucey & hudson 2007 , hereafter paper ii )",
    ", we use our line - strength data to infer the age , total metallicity and  ratio for each galaxy , and investigate the age  metallicity  mass relations and their intrinsic scatter .    throughout this paper , we adopt cosmological parameters @xmath29 . for reference , at the redshift of shapley ( @xmath30 ) , one arcminute corresponds to 57kpc , and the distance modulus is @xmath31 .",
    "the primary galaxy sample was selected using @xmath32 imaging data from the noao fundamental plane survey ( nfps ) , described by smith et al .",
    "the images were obtained with mosaic - ii at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory 4 m telescope in march 2000 .",
    "targets were selected from the same photometric catalogues , generated using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) , as were used to defining the nfps spectroscopic sample .",
    "the systematic zero - point errors in the catalogues are estimated at @xmath30.03mag .",
    "star - galaxy separation is via the usual stellarity index of sextractor , limited by image quality ranging from 0.9 to 1.5arcsec fwhm .",
    "the input catalogue for the spectroscopic phase was defined purely by total magnitude with @xmath0 ( one magnitude deeper than nfps ) , before correction for galactic extinction ( median @xmath33 , @xmath34 , from schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) .",
    "no cuts were made on the colour relative to the red sequence ( unlike nfps ) , nor on morphological type .",
    "no redshift information was used in selecting the sample , so some contamination by background and foreground galaxies is expected .",
    "the input catalogue is inevitably incomplete with respect to low surface brightnesses ( sb ) , since very low - sb galaxies will not have been detected by sextractor .",
    "moreover , very compact galaxies will be misidentified as stars in the imaging data available for selection ( m32 , placed at the distance of shapley , would have an effective radius of @xmath30.1arcsec ) .",

    "the locations of the these fibres were held fixed , while remaining fibres ( both ` good ' and ` fringed ' ) were allocated where possible to extra targets from the 2mass sample .    in the blue arm of the spectrograph ,",

    "was used to expand the total wavelength coverage ( to 58007300 ) .",
    "a total of 565 targets were observed , with 416 from the primary nfps sample and 149 from the supplementary 2mass list .",
    "overall , @xmath360% of the nfps sample targets were observed .",
    "note that because the magnitude information was not used in prioritising fibre assignment , the observed fraction is not a strong function of luminosity .",
    "the data were reduced using a combination of the aao drcontrol pipeline with custom - written procedures .",

    "the well - sampled psf of aaomega ensures that cosmic rays are clearly distinguished from narrow sky lines and emission lines .",
    "the spectra were flat - fielded and extracted ( using a gaussian profile extraction ) with drcontrol .",
    "the combination of spectra from the many 30minute exposures is automated , but handled on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis .",
    "examination of the data revealed sizable variations in signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) between exposures , for some ( but not all ) objects . to lessen the impact of these variations , we first determine",
    "the maximum s / n attained for the galaxy , then discard any individual exposures with s / n less than a quarter of this maximum value before combining to form the final spectrum .",
    "this criterion rejects only @xmath32.5% of the @xmath310000 individual spectra obtained , but @xmath310% of galaxies have at least one rejected spectrum . around half of the affected spectra are from fibres close to the edge of the field - of - view , while the other half are concentrated in an annulus around 0.27degrees from the field centre .",
    "the s / n variations near the edge of the field are more frequent at high airmass , and probably result from varying atmospheric refraction over the course of a field visit , which can cause relative positional offsets of @xmath31arcsec in the worst cases . for comparison",
    "the sample galaxies have effective radii typically 24arcsec ( f. la barbera , private communication ) . when combining the spectra we propagate the error spectra from drcontrol , including missing data flags , to produce a final error spectrum for each galaxy .",
    "finally , an approximate relative flux calibration was imposed using the observed spectrum of a calibration star .",
    "each of the combined spectra was examined by eye to identify any objects unsuitable for the subsequent analysis .",
    "these are : seven stars , three objects in which the target is clearly contaminated by a second galaxy with very different redshift , or by a star , and 15 galaxies whose combined spectra are affected by sinusoidal continuum variations , attributed to ` fringing ' .",
    "these objects are rejected entirely from further discussion . for the remaining 540 ` uncorrupted ' galaxies , the visual inspection confirms",
    "there is sufficient signal to measure at least a reliable redshift , and that any remaining blemishes ( usually from very low - level detector defects and visible only in the faintest galaxies ) affect only localised wavelength regions . among these galaxies ,",

    "reliable velocity dispersion measurements depend on comparing the galaxy spectra to templates which match them as closely as possible .",
    "traditionally , a small number of k giant stars have been observed through the same instrumental set - up for use as templates . while the red giant branch indeed contributes substantially to the integrated v - band light of red - sequence galaxies",
    ", there is a comparable contribution from main - sequence stars near the turn - off ( e.g. fig .",
    "13 of maraston 2005 ) .",
    "the contribution from hotter stars varies systematically with wavelength , and also as a function of the age and metallicity of the target galaxy itself . as a result",
    ", a single template star can not match well over an extended wavelength region .",
    "errors associated with this ` template mismatch ' can cause systematic bias in the recovered velocity dispersions .",
    "methods have been developed which minimize template mismatch by fitting optimal combinations of template stars ( e.g. ppxf of cappellari & emsellem 2004 ) .",
    "here however , we adopt an alternative approach , using as templates a set of synthetic ssp spectra covering a range in metallicity and age .",

    "the whole observed spectrum is used at this stage .",
    "a high - order spline fit to the spectrum is used to identify strong emission lines , which are interpolated over to reduce their influence in the cross - correlation . for radial velocity templates ,",
    "we employ a reduced set of miles ssp spectral models . specifically , we used solar - metallicity ssp models with ages 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , 4.0 , 8.0 and 16.0 gyr , adopting the redshift corresponding to the best - matching ssp , as judged from the fxcor r - value .",
    "the young ssp models proved useful in obtaining good absorption - line redshifts from galaxies with substantial emission plus strong underlying balmer absorption .",
    "we manually inspected all spectra for which the best r - value was less than 10 , and those with substantial variation in the redshifts derived from young and old templates .",
    "in all cases , the measured redshifts were confirmed . comparing to redshifts from the nfps ( smith et al .",
    "2004 ) , for 124 galaxies in common , we obtain a median offset of 11  ( the new measurements larger ) , with a scatter of 23 .    as a preliminary to measuring velocity dispersions ,",
    "we determine the delivered resolution of our spectra as a function of wavelength , by comparing the spectra obtained for a k2 giant , hr7149 , with the spectrum for this star in the indo - us stellar library ( valdes et al . 2004 ) . for wavelengths of 45005750",

    "examination of the results for different templates shows that if we had used a single old , solar - metallicity ssp template , the dispersions would be strongly biased relative to the ` best ' ssp , especially for low - mass galaxies .",
    "specifically , while for @xmath10  the two estimates agree with an offset of only @xmath32 per cent , and a scatter of @xmath311 per cent , for @xmath46 , the median offset is 6 per cent , and for @xmath47 , the bias is 18 per cent . in these cases",

    "the best - matching ssp model is used throughout ; errors associated with selecting the template are therefore not propagated into the velocity dispersion error . if the galaxy - versus - model cross - correlation peak width is narrower than the model autocorrelation peak width , at the 1@xmath1 lower limit , we classify the galaxy as kinematically unresolved .",
    "this is true for 90 of the total 461 galaxies for which measurements were made .",
    "the unresolved galaxies are primarily those with best match to very young ( @xmath48gyr ) ssp models ; many also have strong nebular emission lines .",

    "three distinct corrections must be considered : correction to zero - velocity broadening , correction to the spectral resolution of the models , and correction to match the instrumental response curve used in the models , if this is not a fluxed system ( e.g. the lick / ids system ) .",

    "the effect of velocity broadening can be assessed only empirically by comparison to artificially - broadened template spectra .",
    "most studies in the field have derived velocity broadening corrections ( vbcs ) to the indices , based on measurements on artificially broadened spectra of template stars obtained with the same instrumentation as the galaxies ( e.g. gonzlez 1993 ; davies , sadler & peletier 1993 ; trager et al .",
    "1998 ) . alternatively",
    ", a library of ssp template models can be used to cover a wider range in spectral type , and provide a better match to the composite spectra of real galaxies ( e.g. kuntschner 2004 ) . the correction described by each template spectrum",
    "is usually normalised by the index value at zero velocity dispersion , and the results from different templates averaged into a single multiplicative correction describing the ratio a number of indices ( most notably the  and  indices of worthey & ottoviani 1997 ) can take a range of values which span or approach zero . under such conditions",
    "the usual multiplicative correction fails , and in these cases an additive correction , based on @xmath54 has generally been used .     in general , it is not clear whether one should apply an additive or a multiplicative correction for any given index . in the simplest case , where a single correction curve is used for all the target galaxies , a multiplicative correction may introduce systematic errors as a function of linestrength ( and thus indirectly as a function of @xmath1 ) .",
    "more recently , many works have derived corrections for each galaxy based on a model template chosen to match that galaxy ( e.g. kuntschner et al . 2006 ;  et al .",

    "we smooth the template spectra to mimic both the aaomega instrumental resolution , and also the degradation caused by velocity broadening in steps from zero to 500 .",
    "( we neglect any higher order moments of the line - of - sight velocity distribution , but in principle the method could be generalized to allow for these . )",
    "the indices are measured on the broadened spectra . for each step in @xmath1 , the broad coverage of spectral types",
    "yields a wide range in index value . at each value of @xmath1",
    ", we then simply compare the index measured on the velocity broadened spectrum , @xmath55 , with that measured only allowing instrumental resolution , @xmath56 .",
    "( the subscript ` nat ' here refers to measurements at the native resolution of the spectra . ) for most of the standard indices , this comparison yields a closely linear relation such that @xmath57 ( at fixed @xmath1 ) , with very small scatter .",

    "the coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath59 for each galaxy can be interpolated from the steps in @xmath1 used for smoothing the templates . in most cases",
    "the ssp models span the range of the measured values .",
    "where this is not the case ( e.g. the highest mgb5177 values , for @xmath5-enhanced galaxies ) , the high degree of linearity in the corrections suggests that a small extrapolation is probably safe . in applying the corrections",
    ", we account for the effect of the linear correction to the index error .",
    "the uncertainty in the velocity dispersion ( and hence the coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) could also be propagated to the index error , but in practice this contribution is negligible compared to the index error .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : examplevbcs1 ] shows the corrections derived for the mgb5177 index , for @xmath60 . in this case , the correction @xmath61 increases with index strength such that our correction is almost identical to the usual multiplicative form . in figure",
    "[ fig : examplevbcs2 ] we present the best linear corrections at @xmath62 , for a selection of the principal indices , with a comparison to the equivalent pure multiplicative and pure additive corrections .",
    "the figures demonstrate that the new approach yields linear corrections which hold to a high degree of precision over a very wide range of spectral types .",
    "by contrast , for some indices , the best multiplicative and best additive corrections can be accurate only over a limited range of the index value itself .     as an example , consider the fairly narrow iron index fe5270 .",
    "the linear and multiplicative corrections ( as usually employed for this index ) reproduce the observed values over the whole range of ssps .",
    "by contrast , in the panel for hdf , we find that the multiplicative correction fails badly , as expected for this index .",
    "the additive correction , as usually employed , is as successful as our linear fit , although in both cases there is some metallicity dependence in the residuals . in these cases ,",
    "our results support the form of correction generally adopted .",
    "two counter - examples , where our scheme suggests a different form of correction than the standard method , are hgf and g4300 . for hgf ,",
    "the traditional additive correction is a poor fit to the broadened spectra .",
    "our linear correction is much closer to the multiplicative form , but is a better fit than multiplicative for the most balmer - strong ( young or metal - poor ) models . for g4300 , previous work",
    "has generally applied a multiplicative correction .",
    "our analysis shows that an additive correction is much preferred for this index .",
    "however , the index has a complicated metallicity - dependent behaviour which is not accurately reproduced even by our linear correction scheme .    in summary , the new formulation of the vbcs described here , while not much more complicated or difficult to implement than the traditional approach , improves upon the traditional method in at least two regards : ( i ) greater generality , requiring no subjective preference for additive or multiplicative corrections , and ( ii ) ready applicability over a wide range of spectral types for most indices .",
    "our approach should be equivalent to the more modern methods which derive corrections from matched template spectra .",
    "we contend , however , that describing the vbcs in terms of a mapping from observed index to the value at @xmath63 is a more natural way to present the correction .              in order to compare to models defined at the resolution of the lick / ids stellar library , such as those of worthey ( 1994 ) , thomas et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004 ) , and schiavon ( 2007 ) , it is necessary to match the 812  wavelength - dependent spectral resolution of the ids instrument .",
    "traditionally this is achieved by artificially broadening the spectra prior to measuring the indices .",
    "a serious drawback is that this results in redistribution of any non - uniform noise in the spectra .",
    "for example , in intermediate - redshift observations , residuals from subtracting narrow sky lines would be smeared over @xmath320  intervals . in the data described here ,",
    "noise non - uniformity is less severe , but arises from the blocks of bad columns in the detector .",
    "since our observed wavelength range was shifted mid - way through the observations there are ( usually ) no pixels with unknown values , but in certain regions the variance is doubled since only half the integration yields good data .    an alternative approach , as pointed out by kelson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , is to subsume the resolution correction into the same process as the vbcs .",
    "the correction to the lick resolution can be obtained by measuring indices on the template ssp models after broadening to the lick resolution , but without any velocity broadening , denoted @xmath64 .",
    "the smoothing required for each index is as tabulated by schiavon ( 2007 ) , based on fig .",
    "7 of worthey & ottoviani ( 1997 ) .",
    "corrections from observed to zero velocity dispersion can then be established at the lick instrumental resolution , in the same way as before , by fitting a linear relation @xmath65 , at fixed @xmath1 the right panel of figure  [ fig : examplevbcs1 ] shows the correction for mgb5177 as an example . since the lick resolution is equivalent to @xmath66 , our higher - resolution measurements are subject to a negative correction at low @xmath1 and to a positive correction at high @xmath1 .    to recap , our corrections to zero velocity dispersion and to the lick resolution",
    "are handled in a single step .",
    "the corrections can be applied without smoothing the observed galaxy spectra , correctly preserving the noise properties of the data .      finally , the most widely used models of the past few years are those of thomas et al .",

    "ultimately , we anticipate re - analysing the current data in the context of a new generation of models now being developed ( e.g. schiavon 2007 ; vazdekis et al .",

    ", we will use indices measuring the balmer lines ( specifically hbeta , hgf , hdf ) as age indicators for the galaxy sample , on the assumption that these are dominated by absorption in stars near the main - sequence turn - off .",
    "if the galaxy contains regions of star formation , or hosts an active galactic nucleus ( agn or liner ) , then the balmer lines are contaminated by emission , yielding weaker net absorption and spuriously old age estimates .",
    "such galaxies must either be corrected for the effects of emission or excluded from the sample entirely .",
    "many older studies chose to correct for  emission by assuming a constant ratio between the  and  lines ( e.g. /= 0.6 , trager et al .",

    "moreover , nebular emission at  dominates over the stellar absorption even for very low - levels of star formation or agn luminosity , providing powerful leverage on the contamination of higher - order lines , and robustness against errors in continuum removal ( e.g. caldwell et al .",

    "<S> the relations show the continuation of the familiar trends for giant galaxies into the low luminosity regime , with little change in slope for most indices . comparing the index@xmath4 slopes against predictions from single - burst stellar population models , we infer the scaling relations of age , total metallicity , , and @xmath5-element abundance ratio , . to reproduce the observed index@xmath4 slopes , all three parameters must increase significantly with increasing velocity dispersion . </S>",

    "<S> the recovered age@xmath4 relation is shown to be consistent with the observed evolution in the giant - to - dwarf galaxy ratio in clusters at redshifts @xmath12 . in a companion paper , we determine the age ,  and   for individual galaxies , and investigate in detail the distribution of galaxy properties at fixed velocity dispersion .
