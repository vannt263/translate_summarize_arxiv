    "the strong coupling between light and exciton modes in semiconductor microcavities ( mc s ) has attracted a great deal of interest in the last decade as a novel means to study and control the interaction between radiation and matter @xcite .",
    "the strong coupling of photon and exciton modes in mc s leads to the formation of the _ polariton modes _ which are quasiparticles formed by a quantum superposition of light and matter .",
    "polariton physics is clearly displayed in resonant raman scattering ( rrs ) experiments in which the wave length of the incoming radiation is tuned in such a way that the energy of the outgoing radiation coincides with that of a polariton mode , after emitting a longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonon , for the same conserved two - dimensional ( 2d ) in - plane wave vector @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "former simplified theories , which consider polaritons as the eigenstates of a two - level model , can only qualitatively explain these experiments , and point clearly into the relevance of including dephasing and damping effects in these descriptions.@xcite    in this work we describe the effects of including the coupling with the electron - hole continuum , and the damping effects in rrs as mentioned in reference @xcite .",
    "we consider a system where only two exciton - polariton branches are observed @xcite , which means that only the @xmath1 exciton plays an important role .",
    "a survey of the formalism is presented in the section [ sec : model ] .",
    "section [ sec : results ] contains the results and discussion , and finally some conclusions are presented in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we use the following hamiltonian to model the system @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are creation operators of the mc photon and exciton respectively .",
    "momentum @xmath0 , polarization and other quantum numbers have been omitted to simplify the notation .",
    "the first three terms describe the strong coupling between the mc photon and the exciton @xcite .",
    "the fourth and the fifth terms describe respectively a continuum of radiative modes , with creation operators @xmath5 , and its coupling with the mc photon .",
    "the following two terms have a similar effect for the exciton mode , and @xmath6 describe a combined excitation due to scattering with other quasiparticles ( e.g. acoustic phonons ) .",
    "finally , the last two terms describe the electron - hole continuum ( with @xmath7 the creation operator of a single excitation with relative momentum @xmath8 ) and its coupling with the mc photon .",
    "this hamiltonian can be diagonalized in the form @xmath9 , where the boson operators @xmath10 correspond to linear combinations of all creation operators entering eq .",
    "( [ mod ] ) . denoting the latter for brevity as @xmath11 , then @xmath12 .",
    "instead of diagonalizing the hamitonian we will work with retarded green s functions @xmath13 .",
    "these green s functions can be calculated with the equation of motion method , @xmath14;b_{l}^{\\dagger } \\rangle \\rangle _ { \\omega } $ ] .    to describe the raman intensity we use previous models @xcite , in which @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the probability of conversion of an incident photon @xmath17 into a cavity eigenmode @xmath18",
    ", @xmath19 has an analogous meaning for the scattered eigenmode @xmath20 and the outgoing photon @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the interaction between electrons and the lo phonons .",
    "@xmath23 is the transition probability per unit of time , which we calculate with the fermi s golden rule . taking @xmath24 ( the weight of photon in the scattered eigenmode ) and approximating @xmath25 ( the excitonic part of the scattered eigenmode )",
    ", we obtain @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the density of final states , which can be calculated using the relation @xmath28 , and where we have neglected the dependence of @xmath16 on frequency @xcite .",
    "the quantities @xmath29 can straightforwardly be calculated as @xmath30 .",
    "when @xmath31 is chosen in such a way that the resonance condition for the outgoing polariton is fulfilled , we obtain @xcite @xmath32 the green s functions calculated from the equation of motion are @xmath33 where we have approximated the coupling with continuous modes @xmath34 and @xmath6 as purely imaginary contributions @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "the electron - hole continuum states enter through the sum @xmath37 , and start contributing at the energy of the gap .",
    "this corresponds to vertical transitions in which the light promotes a valence electron with 2d wave vector @xmath38 to the conduction band with the same wave vector . using the effective - mass aproximation we obtain @xcite , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the bottom of the electron - hole continuum ( the energy of the semiconductor gap ) and @xmath41 is a dimensionless parameter that controls the magnitude of the interaction .",
    "the real part @xmath42 can be absorbed in a renormalization of the photon energy and is unimportant in what follows .",
    "the imaginary part is a correction to the photon width @xmath43 for energies above the bottom of the continuum .",
    "applying the theory outlined in the previous section , we calculated the raman intensity for the case of a mc displaying two polariton branches , i. e. where only the @xmath1 exciton mode interacts strongly with the cavity - photon mode , and a rabi splitting of @xmath44 .",

    "figure  [ rrs1]a shows the calculated raman intensity profiles ( as function of the stokes shifted energy ) for some selected and fixed positive photon - exciton detuning ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the calculated profiles show resonances at the energies corresponding to the lower ( lp ) and upper ( up ) polariton branches , indicated by the dotted lines . the maximum of the resonance with the up ( indicated with circles in fig .",

    "the experimental rrs data from ref.@xcite taken at exact resonance with the cavities up is also displayed ( solid squares ) .",

    "we can see that when the upper polariton ( up ) mode energy increases above @xmath40 entering the electron - hole continuum ( thick lines in fig .",
    "[ rrs1]a ) , the intensity of the raman process falls abruptly .",
    "this can be understood from eq.([green ] ) : the imaginary part in the denominator increases producing a decrease in values of @xmath46 , corresponding to processes in which light has enough energy to promote valence band electrons into the conduction band .",

    "this method allows a consistent introduction of damping mechanisms in polariton lifetime , being the most significant the interaction of mc photon with the electron - hole continuum .",
    "we are able to reproduce the main features of the experiment and the observed decrease in the raman efficiency when the up polariton branch enters the continuum of electron - hole excitations .",
