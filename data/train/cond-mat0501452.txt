    "wetting phenomena concerns the properties of the liquid film which forms when an undersaturated vapor ( fluid ) is put in contact with a solid inert substrate . the critical properties of the liquid ",
    "vapor interface are , generally , determined by nature and range of the intervening interactions . in this respect ,",
    "e.g. for a planar substrate , different interactions potentials determine the applicability of partial or complete wetting regimes as well as the nature of the wetting transition ( for a review on these phenomena see @xcite ) .",
    "however , substrate surface geometry can strongly influence these properties .",
    "for example , in the complete wetting regime , adsorption isotherms of random rough substrates @xcite and linearly sculpted substrates @xcite exhibit unusual exponents which are determined by the surface geometry . on the other hand , while for planar geometry partial wetting prevents the growth of macroscopic films , in the same conditions , in pure wedges , we can have continuous filling phenomena by which the film thickness is driven to infinity @xcite . finally , and this is particularly relevant for wetting critical properties , there are many indications that increasing surface roughness can change the order of the wetting transition to first",
    " order @xcite .",
    "in this paper we report the results of an accurate investigation about the unbinding properties of a thermally fluctuating interface in wedge  modified systems ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , we denoted _ structured wedges _ ( sw ) .",
    "the choice of such a system structure is motivated by the fact that they incorporate contrasting geometrical motives ( like wedges and ridges ) which are typical of the geometry of rough surfaces . in this respect , while the separate effects of these geometries on wetting phenomena are already rather well known @xcite , the effects of their combination were never approached in detail before . here",
    ", we consider the study of both 2@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "1@xmath3 ) and 3@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "1@xmath4 ) sws , and our results show that such structures implies two stage interface unbinding transition , one of which discontinuous .",
    "our analysis of the phenomenon allows to understand its intimate connection with the surface geometry as well as to make some extension to the wetting properties of rough boundaries .",
    "in the framework of solid on solid ( sos ) approach our model liquid ",
    "vapor interface corresponds to a lattice random walk ( in 2@xmath2 ) or to a random surface ( in 3@xmath2 ) in the vicinity of a fixed substrate boundary .",
    "if @xmath5 denotes the substrate boundary ( integer ) height at the position @xmath6 ( depending on 2@xmath2 or 3@xmath2 space dimension , @xmath6 denotes a single variable @xmath7 or a couple of variable @xmath8 , respectively ) , the interface configurations can be specified in terms of the local relative ( integer ) height variables @xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "the discrete nature of the model , implies that non horizontal walls ( see the magnifying glass in fig .",
    "1 ) are shaped as staircases with slopes not exceeding unity .",
    "consequently , the height function @xmath5 satisfy the conditions @xmath10 and @xmath11 in 2@xmath2 and 3@xmath2 , respectively . in 3@xmath2 , because of the translation invariance along @xmath12 axis , one has also @xmath13 .",
    "= 0.45    at coexistence ( no chemical potential differences with respect to its critical bulk value ) , an interface ( see fig .",
    "2@xmath14 ) , can be studied in terms of an hamiltonian of the form @xmath15 where the first sum is done over all pairs of nearest neighbor columns . in the above expression @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( with @xmath18 )",
    "are the energy cost of any interface step ( or plaquette in 3@xmath2 ) and the energy gain of each interface contact ( of horizontal step or plaquette ) with the substrate , respectively ; @xmath19 or @xmath20 determines the sos or restricted sos ( rsos ) character of the implemented walk model , respectively . to limit the computational complexity , in 3@xmath2 we consider only rsos interfaces .",
    "in 2@xmath2 , an interface in the vicinity of a boundary ( with a generic shape ) can be fully treated by a transfer matrix approach based on the matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 defined as follows    [ rx - lx ] @xmath23_{z , z ' } } & = & { \\omega^{|z'-z+h_{x+1}-h_x|^\\gamma } k^{\\delta_{z',0}}},\\label{r_x } \\\\ { [ \\hat{\\bm{l}}_x]_{z , z ' } } & = & { \\omega^{|z'-z+h_{x-1}-h_x|^\\gamma } k^{\\delta_{z',0}}}.\\label{l_x}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) correspond to step and wall fugacities and , by definition , @xmath28_{z , z'}$ ] and @xmath29_{z , z'}$ ] are the boltzmann weights of the elementary walks from @xmath30 to @xmath31 or @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "thus , the partition function of , e.g. the walks between @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "2@xmath3 ) , is given by @xmath35_{0,0 } \\equiv \\omega^{x_2-x_1}[\\hat{\\bm{l}}_{x_1\\leftarrow x_2 } ] _ { 0,0},\\ ] ] with @xmath36 and @xmath37    but the transfer matrix approach allows also the direct calculation of the distance probability distribution function ( pdf ) at any position along the boundary .",
    "a walk like the one in fig .",
    "2@xmath3 can be divided in two parts , e.g. at @xmath38 , obtaining two walks with boltzmann weights @xmath39_{0,z}$ ] and @xmath40_{0,z}$ ] , respectively .",
    "thus , the walk distance pdf at @xmath38 is proportional to the product @xmath41_{0,z}\\cdot [ \\hat{\\bm{l}}_{x_0\\leftarrow x_2}]_{0,z}$ ] . on the other hand , _ storing _ the initial walk distance distributions , at @xmath42 and @xmath43 , in the vectors @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( in the case of fig .",
    "2@xmath3 we should set @xmath46_z= [ \\bm{l}_{x_2}]_z= \\delta_{z,0}$ ] ) , the following iterations @xmath47 allows to get the quantities @xmath41_{0,z}$ ] and @xmath40_{0,z}$ ] in terms of the components of @xmath48 and @xmath49 vectors .",
    "indeed , iterations ( [ r_l_propagation ] ) transfer toward right and left the local walk distance distributions to any position along the boundary , like in a forward diffusion process . therefore , in the limit of an indefinite walk ( our interface model ) ,",
    "i.e. @xmath50 , the transferred right and left pdfs , defined as @xmath51}}[\\bm{r}_{x_0}]_z;\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ p_{x_0}^{(l)}(z)={1\\over{[\\bm{l}_{x_0}]}}[\\bm{l}_{x_0}]_z,\\ ] ] will reach steady profiles depending only on the specific boundary conformation . in these conditions",
    "the interface pdf at any position @xmath38 will be given by @xmath52 and the quantity @xmath53,\\ ] ] can be seen as the corresponding local excess interface free energy profile .",
    "our sws boundaries contain only unit vertical steps .",
    "thus , the transfer matrices ( [ rx - lx ] ) can be of only three different forms , i.e. those corresponding to a down step , an up step and no vertical step ; we denote these matrices as @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively . for",
    "tilted wall regions with slope @xmath57 , the calculation of right and left pdfs can be done by implementing iterations ( [ r_l_propagation ] ) in terms of @xmath58 or @xmath59 matrices ( depending on the descending or ascending character of the wall ) ; for large system sizes , the corresponding @xmath60 and @xmath61 will asymptotically become eigenvectors of these matrices .",
    "in particular , in binding conditions ( i.e. at high enough @xmath62 values ) , the interface pdfs at @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( see fig .",
    "1@xmath3 ) will correspond to @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 being the bound eigenvectors of matrices @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively . in this respect ,",
    "an accurate investigation allows the determination of these states ( exact for @xmath69 , numerical for @xmath70 ) both for sos as well as rsos walk models .",
    "a brief analysis of @xmath71 case ( tilted walls with unit slope ) is particularly useful for the understanding of the general scenario",
    ". matrices @xmath58 and @xmath59 reduce to @xmath72 and @xmath73 and for sos walks both @xmath74 and @xmath75 components scale as @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "@xmath78 , and thus the local character of @xmath74 ( i.e. @xmath79 ) is achieved until @xmath80 , with @xmath81 .",
    "the corresponding interface pdf at the sw bottoms ( i.e. @xmath63 ) is @xmath82 and the resulting interface average distance , @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 as @xmath85 , @xmath86 diverges with continuity as @xmath87^{-1}$ ] and thus @xmath88 is the critical fugacity associated to the continuous interface unbinding from sw bottoms .",
    "this transition is the analog of the critical filling transition in pure wedge geometry @xcite .",
    "we have verified that for @xmath89 one observe the same behavior ( also for rsos walk model ) and in fig .",
    "3 we show the corresponding phase  line boundaries , consisting in the the plot of the quantity @xmath90 .",
    "the picture demonstrate that in the wedge geometry , in contrast to the case of flat substrates ( see the bottom curves in fig .",
    "3 ) , a bound interface always ( also at low @xmath91 ) requires a finite attraction energy @xmath62 .",
    "on the other hand , the local minima in the phase  line boundaries confirm the possibility of reentrance phenomena which were already predicted @xcite for rough self  affine boundaries .",
    "more details about these aspects will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "= 0.45    on the contrary , @xmath92 and therefore the local character of @xmath75 is achieved for @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "thus , when @xmath95 approaches @xmath88 from above , and the interface unbinds from sw bottoms , it remains tightly bound to the central ridge . to be more precise , in the limit @xmath96^+$ ]",
    "the mean interface distance from the sw central ridge is finite and is given by @xmath97    finally , for @xmath98 we are out of binding conditions for @xmath72 matrix and the lateral descending walls of the sw are no more able to bind the walks : iterations ( [ r_l_propagation ] ) , asymptotically produce delocalized right and left pdfs . in these conditions ,",
    "the presence of the central ridge can have only very marginal effects ( vanishing with the size of the structure ) and , thus , the interface unbinds from the sw . the conclusion is : @xmath88 is also the threshold of a discontinuous unbinding transition ! the curves in fig .",
    "3 can be seen also as the interface phase ",
    "lines for 2@xmath2 sw first ",
    "order unbinding .",
    "= 0.45    the conclusive validation of the above , surprising , conclusion is obtained by the analysis of the free energy profiles . in fig .",
    "4 we show a plot of @xmath99 ( panel @xmath3 ) and @xmath100 ( panel @xmath4 ) profiles obtained at fixed @xmath91 for an rsos interface in a finite size sw with wall slope @xmath101 ( see the specific sw dimensions in the figure legend ) characterized by an unbinding critical fugacity @xmath102 ( exact calculation ) . curves in panel @xmath3 show , as @xmath95 decreases , the following free energy profile evolution : @xmath0 ) a unique free energy minimum at @xmath103 ( for @xmath104 ) which delocalizes into a wide one at @xmath105 ( i.e. the continuous transition in the pure wedges ) ; @xmath1 ) double minima profiles for @xmath106 with the minima placed at @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( i.e. coexistence between the state localized at the sw central ridge height and the bulk unbound state ) ; @xmath109 ) dominance of bulk unbound state ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "an analogous evolution is extracted by the free energy profiles of @xmath111 in panel @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , in passing between @xmath1 ) and @xmath109 ) we have a discontinuous transition !",
    "finally , the picture clarifies that the discontinuous nature of such transition is strictly related to the fact that , for diverging system size , @xmath112 parameter maintains larger than the widths of the two free energy minima ( scaling as @xmath113 ) .",
    "transfer matrix approach is not applicable to the wetting problem in 3@xmath2 . in this case",
    "we have considered metropolis monte carlo simulations of an rsos fluctuating interface ( see fig .",
    "2@xmath4 ) in a 3@xmath2 sw geometry like the one sketched in fig . 1@xmath4 .",
    "because of rapid increase of computation times with system size , we have considered relatively small systems : the simulations were done for squared system with size @xmath114 ( in the @xmath12 axis direction ) and @xmath115 ( @xmath116 and @xmath117 are in lattice units ) and using periodical boundary conditions along both @xmath7 and @xmath12 axes .",
    "the sws considered in the simulations were usually constructed by ( staircase ) tilted walls with slope 1 or 1/2 and @xmath118 ( see fig .",
    "1@xmath4 ) . as usual",
    ", the implemented metropolis monte carlo algorithm was based on local moves corresponding to the attempt of changing ( at random ) the local surface height by one unit ( i.e. @xmath119 ) .",
    "after equilibration , the calculation of equilibrium average parameters has been performed on the basis of very long simulations of up to @xmath120 @xmath121 ( 1 @xmath122 monte carlo moves ) .    in fig .",
    "5 , as a representative of the general behavior , we show the @xmath62 dependence of the interface averages distances from sw bottoms ( @xmath86 , panel @xmath3 ) and sw central ridge ( @xmath123 , panel @xmath4 ) obtained a constant @xmath91 for a given 3@xmath2 sw ( see geometrical specifications in figure legend ) .",
    "the behavior of these two quantities follows a scheme very similar to the one outlined for 2@xmath2 sw interface unbinding : @xmath0 ) a continuous filling  like transition of the two component wedges at @xmath124 ( note also in the right inset in panel @xmath3 the roughly flat height distribution ) ; @xmath1 ) a discontinuous detachment from the sw central ridge at @xmath125 ( see the double peak structure of the interface height distributions in the left insets in panel @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "however , at least for the finite size system considered here , continuous and discontinuous unbinding seem to be separated by a finite @xmath62 gap .",
    "most probably this is due to the linear extension of the system along @xmath12 axis which corresponds to the main difference between the present 3@xmath2 sw geometry and the 2@xmath2 one . with an extensive simulations program",
    ", we planned to evaluate the whole interface phase ",
    "lines for 3@xmath2 wedges with the intent to clarify also this aspect .",
    "our investigation demonstrate that interface unbinding in sws takes place in two stages : the first one corresponds to the continuous filling transition of the two component wedges ; in the second stage the interface jumps , discontinuously , from a state localized at the sw central ridge and the bulk unbound state .",
    "we stress the fact that in sws the bulk unbound state come into field , rather than in some artificial way @xcite , just because of the _ corrugated _ geometry of the substrate . first  order nature of the final unbinding transition is due to the _ competition _ between binding at the central ridge and whole sw filling . in other words , it is the spatial combination of wedges and ridges of sws to create the conditions for a discontinuous interface unbinding . as seen in section iii ,",
    "a single ridge is only able to strongly pin the interface retarding ( with respect to a wedge ) its unbinding from the apex ( for more details see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in complete wetting regime , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , interface unbinding near the apex mimics planar critical wetting .",
    "generalization of our conclusions to more complex sws and/or to random rough surfaces should take into account , carefully , the type and the scaling properties of the corrugation introduced by the specific boundary .",
    "on the other hand , our analysis about interface unbinding in 2@xmath2 sws give some more efforts on the key role of surface roughening exponent @xmath126 in determining the nature of the wetting transition in self ",
    "affine rough substrates . in the light of the present results ,",
    "we have started new investigations of 2@xmath2 and 3@xmath2 rough geometries , with the purpose to get conclusive insights in this issues ."
