    "active galactic nuclei ( agns , urry & padovani 1995 ) powered by accretion of material onto super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) are the most luminous and persistent sources of electromagnetic radiation in the universe . in the pre-@xmath1/lat ( large area telescope ; atwood et al .",
    "2009 ) era , it was known that @xmath0-rays from agns are produced in blazars and radio galaxies ( hartman et al .",
    "thanks to the successful operation of @xmath1/lat , a new class of @xmath0-ray agns , the radio - loud narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( rlnls1s ) , has been firmly established ( abdo et al .",
    "2009a , b ; ackermann et al . 2015 ) .",
    "nls1s are characterized by a narrow width of the broad blamer emission lines with fwhm ( h@xmath4 ) @xmath5 2000 km @xmath6 , along with strong optical feii lines and weak forbidden lines ( e.g. pogge 2000 ) .",
    "nls1s are thought to have small black hole masses ( between @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath9 ) and accretion systems with eddington ratios larger than @xmath30.1 , indicative of an early stage of agn activity ( e.g. boroson & green 1992 ; collin & kawaguchi 2004 ) , while normal radio - loud agns , such as blazars and radio galaxies , tend to have higher central bh mass and lower eddington ratios ( sikora et al .",
    "rlnls1s are likely hosted by late - type galaxies while other radio - loud agns tend to be in early - type galaxies ( e.g. collin & kawaguchi 2004 ) .",
    "the detection of the mev@xmath10gev @xmath0 rays of the rlnls1s provides the direct evidence for the presence of a closely aligned relativistic jets in these systems ( abdo et al .",
    "2009a , 2009b ; yuan et al . 2008 ) , which seems to be at odds with the paradigm that a fully developed relativistic jet could happen only in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. marscher 2010 ) .",
    "so far , @xmath0-ray emissions have been detected in several rlnls1s by @xmath1/lat ( abdo et al .",
    "2009a , b ; ackermann et al . 2015",
    "; dammando et al . 2012 , 2015 ; yao et al .",
    "they all show flat radio - spectrum which is a distinct character of blazars ( foschini et al .",
    "2015 ) . and",
    "evidence of significantly doppler beaming effect has been found for all these sources , such as : superluminal motion of jet component ( dammando et al .",
    "2012 ) , very high radio brightness temperature ( e.g. yuan et al . 2008 ; gallo et al .",
    "2006 ) , high radio core dominance parameter ( e.g. foschini et al .",
    "2015 ) , and rapid variability in @xmath0-ray and optical / infarad bands ( jiang et al . 2012 ; paliya et al . 2013 , 2014 ) .",
    "comparing to @xmath0-ray blazars , @xmath0-ray nls1s tend to have lower @xmath0-ray luminosities , which may be due to their small black hole masses ( e.g. chen & bai 2010 ) .",
    "in contrast , @xmath0-ray emission from the steep radio spectrum radio loud nls1s , whose jets are widely believed to be mis - aligned , has not been discovered yet .",
    "because of their large jet inclination angles , the @xmath11ray emission is expected to be significantly suppressed by the doppler beaming effect .",
    "that is why no @xmath0-ray mis - aligned nls1 has been predicted before .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath0-ray misaligned nls1s , if exist , are very important because they offer a different perspective than flat radio spectrum sources for approaching high - energy phenomena .",
    "the study of mis - aligned @xmath0-ray nls1s can also shed light on the disk - jet connection and are helpful to understand the unified scheme of radio loud agns .",
    "b3 1441 + 476 is one of two nls1s and is very radio loud ( @xmath12=1331 , yuan et al .",
    "2008 ) together with a steep radio spectrum between 151 mhz and 4.85  ghz ( @xmath13 = 0.60 , gu et al .",
    "2015 , throughout this work we refer to a spectral index @xmath14 as the energy index such that @xmath15 , corresponding to a photon index @xmath16 ) .",
    "the target exhibits typical nls1 behaviors with a broad h@xmath4 emission line with a width ( fwhm ) of ( 1848@xmath17113 ) km @xmath6 , along with @xmath18 @xmath3 1.5 and [ oiii]@xmath195007/h@xmath4 @xmath3 0.3 ( yuan et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the central bh mass is estimated as @xmath20 @xmath9 and the eddington ratio is given as 0.34 ( berton et al . , 2015 ) .",
    "in this paper , we analyze the lat data of nls1 b3 1441 + 476 and report the discovery of its @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section 2 the routines of _ fermi_/lat and swift data analysis are introduced ; in section 4 we summarize our results with some discussion .",
    "the _ fermi_/lat ( atwood et al . 2009 ) is a pair - conversion @xmath0-ray telescope sensitive to photon energies greater than 20 mev .",
    "it has a large peak effective area ( @xmath38000 @xmath21 for 1 gev photons ) , viewing @xmath22 2.4 sr of the full sky with angular resolution ( 68% containment radius ) better than @xmath23 at 1 gev . in its routine survey mode",
    ", lat performs a complete and uniform coverage of the sky in every 3 hours .",
    "the latest _ pass _ 8 data used in this paper were collected during the first 7-year operation from 2008 august 4th to 2015 august 4th .",
    "photon events belonging to ` evclass ` 128 and ` evtype ` 3 with the energy ranging from 500 mev to 500 gev were considered . because the angular resolution of lat increases rapidly with the energy in the sub - gev energy range , 500  mev is chosen to avoid significant contamination from the background . the updated standard _",
    "sciencetools _ software package version ` v10r0p5 ` with the instrument response functions of ` p8r2_source_v6 ` was adopted throughout the data analysis . for the lat background files , we used ` gll_iem_v06.fit ` as the galactic diffuse model and ` iso_p8r2_source_v6_v06.txt ` for the isotropic diffuse emission template . the entire data set was filtered with ` gtselect ` and ` gtmktime ` tasks by following the standard analysis threads .",
    "the ` unbinned ` likelihood algorithm ( mattox et al . 1996 ) implemented in the ` gtlike ` task was used to extract the flux and spectrum .",
    "all sources from the fermi lat third source catalog ( 3fgl , acero et al .",
    "2015 ) within @xmath24 of the target were included .",
    "the flux and spectral parameters of sources within @xmath25 region of interest ( roi ) together with normalization factors of the two diffuse backgrounds were set free , while parameters of other sources were fixed at the 3fgl values .",
    "firstly , we added a @xmath0-ray source with powerlaw spectral template corresponding to b3 1441 + 476 into the initial background model generated from ` make3fglxml.py ` .",
    "its @xmath0-ray position was initially set as same as its radio position . after we fitted this model",
    ", we checked the test statistic ( ts ) value of the target and made a @xmath26 scale residual ts map with each pixel size of @xmath27 . if any @xmath0-ray excess with ts value over 25 appeared in the ts map , we added a new source with powerlaw spectral template into the background model to account for each excess .",
    "@xmath0-ray locations of the target and the new background sources were obtained by task ` gtfindsrc ` .",
    "then the updated background model was refitted to obtain the final result .",
    "the multi - wavelength observatory _ swift _ carries three instruments ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) , including the burst alter telescope ( bat ) , the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) , and the uv / optical telescope ( uvot ) . in 2012 , the _ swift _ visited the source region 11 times with a total exposure time of @xmath28 ks .",
    "all xrt data were taken in the photon - counting mode , and were processed with the task of ` xrtpipeline ` .",
    "we extracted the x - ray photons at the source position within 30and just obtained 45 counts which are not sufficient for spectral modeling . in this case , the stacked image was analyzed with the x - ray image analysis program , ` ximage ` , and the count rates around the source coordinate were estimated to be of @xmath29 and @xmath30 cts s@xmath31 in 0.2@xmath1010 kev and 0.2@xmath102 kev , respectively . assuming an absorbed power - law model with the column density fixed to @xmath32 @xmath33 ( yuan et al .",
    "2008 ) , we determined the photon index of @xmath34 and the unabsorbed flux in 0.2@xmath1010 kev of @xmath35 ergs @xmath33 s@xmath31 with the help of ` webpimms ` .",
    "the uvot has six filters : v , b , u , uvw1 , uvm2 and uvw2 .",
    "when available , extensions are summed within each image using ` uvotimsum ` . to determine the source magnitude",
    ", we performed aperture photometry for all filters in the sky image using ` uvotsource ` with a source extraction region from 5 , and the background emissions were extracted from a neighboring source - free region . the averaged magnitudes ( in ab system ) in the six bands were @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "there is a significant @xmath0-ray excess against the background around the radio position of b3 1441 + 476 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the ts value of the excess component is @xmath22 45.5 , corresponding to a significance of 5.9@xmath42 .",
    "the source is located at a high galactic latitude ( @xmath43 ) , which does not suffer from significant uncertainty of the galactic diffuse emission .",
    "thus , we check the possible contamination from the @xmath0-ray neighbors .",
    "the brightest @xmath0-ray source within the roi is 3fgl j1454.5 + 5124 which is about @xmath44 away from the target with ts value of @xmath22 3000 .",
    "its photon flux is almost one order of magnitude higher than that of the excess . noting that the 95% confidence level ( c.l . ) of lat point - spread function ( psf ) for 500 mev photons is about @xmath45 , significant contamination from 3fgl j1454.5 + 5124 is unlikely . the nearest @xmath0-ray source 3fgl j1440.1 + 4955 with ts value of @xmath22235 is @xmath46 away from the target . since these two sources have comparable photon fluxes and 68% c.l .",
    "of lat psf for 500 mev photons is about @xmath47 , contamination from 3fgl j1440.1 + 4955 can be also ignored .",
    "therefore , the detection of @xmath0-ray emission excess is robust .",
    "localization of the central excess is performed by the ` gtfindsrc ` task , giving a @xmath0-ray position of r.a .",
    "@xmath48 and dec .",
    "@xmath49 , with a 95% c. l. error radius of @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "since it is a high galactic latitude source , radio - loud agn is supposed to be its ideal counterpart .",
    "we seek the potential counterparts through the simbad database . actually , b3 1441 + 476 is found to be the only radio - loud agn within the 95% c.l . @xmath0-ray radius with angular separation of @xmath52 .",
    "any flat - spectrum radio sources indicative of potential blazar candidates are not found within the 95% c.l .",
    "@xmath0-ray radius .",
    "the second nearest known radio - loud agn is a radio galaxy sdss j144246.29 + 474129.4 whose angular separation from the @xmath0-ray location is @xmath53 . and",
    "the nearest blazar sdss j144446.10 + 474257.7 is @xmath54 away .",
    "furthermore , we investigate infarad colors of b3 1441 + 476 to check whether it is included in the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; wright et al .",
    "2010 ) @xmath0-ray strip ( wgs , massaro et al .",
    "it is detected with high s / n in all four bands ( w1 , w2 , w3 , w4 ) , with magnitudes in the wise all - sky source catalog of 13.389@xmath170.025 , 12.292@xmath170.022 , 9.341@xmath170.024 and 6.726@xmath170.052 , respectively .",
    "the infarad colors of w2-w3 and w1-w2 are given as 2.95 and 1.10 , respectively .",
    "therefore , b3 1441 + 476 indeed occupies the wsg area , similar with other @xmath0-ray nls1s ( foschini et al . 2015 ) , suggesting it is capable to generate significant @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "motivated by these facts , we conclude that the central significant @xmath0-ray excess is from b3 1441 + 476 .    by analyzing the entire 7-year lat data",
    ", we obtain a best - fitting powerlaw function for b3 1441 + 476 : @xmath55 with an integrated flux of @xmath56 photons @xmath57 @xmath6 .",
    "no significant evidence of spectral curvature is found .",
    "considering its redshift as 0.703 ( in this work we take a @xmath58cdm cosmology with @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 ) , the average isotropic apparent @xmath0-ray luminosity from 100 mev to 100 gev is @xmath62 erg @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath0-ray sed is extracted by dividing the whole data into 5 sub - energy bins .",
    "a powerlaw gives an acceptance description to the sed , which well agrees with the entire fit , see figure 2 .",
    "a yearly @xmath0-ray light curve has been also extracted , see figure 3a . because the source is relatively faint in @xmath0 rays",
    ", we fix the spectral index of each time bin to the value of the average fit .",
    "the source is barely detected by lat in the first four years , that is why it is absent in 3lac ( ackermann et al .",
    "a detailed three months bin @xmath0-ray light curve has been extracted for the last three years .",
    "the peak flux is @xmath63 photons @xmath57 @xmath6 , nearly four times that of the average flux .",
    "b3 1441 + 476 may resemble mis - aligned agns that exhibit moderate @xmath0-ray variability at time scale of months ( e.g. liao et al .",

    "so does the @xmath0-ray luminosity .",
    "the difference between b3 1441 + 476 and other @xmath0-ray nls1s is that the former has a steep radio spectrum .",
    "we note that pks 2004@xmath10447 has a flat radio spectrum below 5  ghz but possesses a steep radio spectrum above 8.4  ghz ( healey et al . 2007 ;",

    "recently , its 5 ghz very long baseline array ( vlba ) observations have been available ( gu et al . 2015 ) .",
    "the total flux density at 5 ghz from the vlba image is close to that in the single dish gb6 catalog , suggesting that it is compact in the sub - as scale . in mas scale ,",
    "its radio core is not directly observed , perhaps hidden in the brightest jet component whose brightness temperature is about @xmath77 k ( gu et al .",
    "therefore , the core dominance ( @xmath12 ) of b3 1441 + 476 is constrained as @xmath2 0.67 , where the @xmath12 is defined as the flux ratio between the jet core component and the extended component . together with its steep radio spectrum ,",
    "b3 1441 + 476 distinguishes significantly from all other @xmath0-ray nls1s ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "moreover , since it is not detected in the very large array low - frequency sky survey redux catalog ( vlssr , lane et al .",
    "2014 ) , considering the vlssr 74 mhz 5@xmath42 unpper limit ( @xmath78 jy ) , its radio spectrum shows a clear trend of a turnover around 100  mhz ( also see gu et al .",
    "given its radio spectrum characters and the compact structure , this nls1 shares similarity with compact steep - spectrum ( css ) radio sources .",
    "the fit of sed of b3 1441 + 476 can constrain the jet emission ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the b3 1441 + 476 tends to have a smaller compton dominance ( cd ) value , @xmath21 , while cd values of some other @xmath0-ray nls1s are @xmath79 , even up to 100 ( e.g. abdo et al .",

    "since no rapid variability is found from radio to @xmath0 rays , the radius of the radiation region is set to be @xmath94  cm , corresponding to a variability timescale of one month , @xmath95 .",
    "assuming that one proton corresponds to one relativistic emitting electron and that protons are ` cold ' in the comoving frame ( celotti & ghisellini 2008 ) , the power of jet is estimated as @xmath3 4@xmath96 erg @xmath6 .",

    "note that a similar radiation model applied successfully to a @xmath0-ray ssrq 3c 275.1 ( liao et al .",
    "in conclusion , motivated by its multiwavelength properties , b3 1441 + 476 likely hosts mis - aligned jet and is hence the first @xmath0-ray mis - aligned nls1 .",
    "likely the strong relativistic jet and the violent accretion activity are growing up simultaneously .",
    "the connection between these two components can be further investigated by analyzing the x - ray and @xmath0-ray light curves of b3 1441 + 476 . due to the faintness of its x - ray emission ,",
    "future deep x - ray observation is essential . we also note that the number ratio between @xmath0-ray nls1s with aligned and mis - aligned jets ( @xmath310 ) is lower than that between @xmath0-ray blazars and magn ( @xmath3100 ) , which may be a challenge of the orientation - based unified model .",
    "one puzzle remains .",
    "there are dozens of flat radio spectrum nls1s while just a few steep radio spectrum nls1s , somewhat at odds with the unified scheme of rl - agn .",
    "two scenarios are proposed to solve this puzzle .",
    "it could be just a selection effect if the blr of nls1s has a disk - like geometry ( e.g. shen & ho 2014 ) .",
    "there is no doppler broadening and hence the fwhm of permitted lines are narrower than in a normal seyfert 1 when it is observed pole - on .",
    "otherwise the doppler broadening is turn - on so it would be classified as a normal radio galaxy .",
    "another scenario is that nls1s are young galaxies ( e.g. grupe 2000 ) . for young radio sources , their jets",
    "are not well developed so they becomes almost invisible for current observations . actually , rl - nls1s do share a lot of similarities with young radio sources ( e.g. yuan et al .",
    "b3 1441 + 476 is an ideal source for distinguishing between these two scenarios .",
    "as mentioned before , it has a compact radio morphology at as scale ( ls @xmath2 8  kpc ) and steep radio spectrum with a turnover at about 100  mhz ( gu et al .",
    "it could be classified as a css .",
    "therefore , for b3 1441 + 476 the young radio source scenario is preferred .",
    "however , extended radio emissions exceeding the typical size of css have recently been observed for all the three arbitrarily selected rlnls1 with enhanced sensitivity ( richards & lister 2015 ) .",
