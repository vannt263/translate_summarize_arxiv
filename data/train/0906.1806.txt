    "entropy comes from some ( partially ) hyperbolic structure , and is conjectured to be accompanied with plenty of invariant measures .",
    "the work presented here explores answers to such conjectures in a case of skew product maps .    for a compact riemannian manifold @xmath4 and a @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ,",
    "this means the derivatives are @xmath7-hlder continuous ) diffeomorphism @xmath8 on @xmath4 , if @xmath8 preserves an ergodic measure @xmath1 , then there are real numbers @xmath9 , @xmath10 , such that for @xmath1-almost every point @xmath11 , there are subspaces @xmath12 of the tangent space @xmath13 such that for any vector @xmath14 , @xmath15 here @xmath16 is some integer number no more than the dimension of @xmath4 and these subspaces are invariant of @xmath17 , the derivative of @xmath8 .",
    "these numbers @xmath9 are called lyapunov exponents .",
    "we say @xmath1 is a hyperbolic measure if all lyapunov exponents are nonzero .",
    "three decades ago , a. katok established a well - known result as following :    [ thka](katok , @xcite ) if the metric entropy @xmath18 and @xmath1 is an ergodic hyperbolic measure , then for any @xmath19 , there is a hyperbolic horseshoe @xmath20 such that @xmath21    this theorem has an interesting corollary : under the conditions of the theorem , there are ergodic measures @xmath22 such that @xmath23 for any real number @xmath24 $ ] , i.e. all possible entropies of ergodic measures form an interval . since the horseshoe map is a full shift , these measures can be constructed by taking sub - shifts or properly assigning weights to different symbols .",
    "existence of these measures of intermediate entropies exhibits the complicated structure of the system .",
    "till now it is not known whether every smooth system ( @xmath2 diffeomorphism ) on a compact manifold with positive ( topological ) entropy has this property . in general ,",
    "such a system may not have a hyperbolic measure .",
    "herman constructed a well - known example , which is a minimal @xmath25 diffeomorphism with positive topological entropy @xcite .",
    "so in the general case even a closed invariant subset should not be expected .",
    "fortunately , minimality may not prevent the system from having measures of intermediate entropies , which is the case in herman s example .",
    "herman suggested the question whether for every smooth system positive topological entropy violates unique ergodicity .",
    "katok conjectured more ambitiously : these systems must have measures of arbitrary intermediate entropies .",

    "it concludes that @xmath0 has ergodic measures of arbitrary entropies between @xmath42 and @xmath3 .",
