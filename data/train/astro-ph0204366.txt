    "the formation of galactic disks is one of the most important unsolved problems in astrophysics today . in the currently favored hierarchical clustering framework , disks form in the potential wells of dark matter haloes as the baryonic material cools and collapses dissipatively .",
    "it has been shown ( fall & efstathiou 1980 ) that disks formed in this way can be expected to possess the observed amount of angular momentum ( and therefore the observed spatial extent ) , but only under the condition that the infalling gas retains most of its original angular momentum  see also fall ( 2002 ) .",
    "numerical simulations of this collapse scenario in cdm cosmologies , however , have so far consistently indicated that , when only radiative cooling processes are included , the infalling gas loses too much angular momentum ( by more than an order of magnitude ) and the resulting disks are accordingly much smaller than required by the observations ( e.g. , navarro & benz 1991 ; navarro & white 1994 ; navarro , frenk , & white 1995 ; navarro & steinmetz 1997 using n - body / sph codes and bryan 2003 using an adaptive mesh refinement code , bryan 1999 ) .",
    "this discrepancy is known as the _ angular momentum problem _ of disk galaxy formation .",
    "it arises from the combination of the following two facts : a ) in the cdm scenario the magnitude of linear density fluctuations @xmath14 increases steadily with decreasing mass scale @xmath15 leading to the formation of non - linear , virialized structures at increasingly early epochs with decreasing mass , i.e.  the hierarchical `` bottom - up '' scenario .",
    "b ) gas cooling is very efficient at early times due to gas densities being generally larger at higher redshifts , as well as the rate of inverse compton cooling also increasing very rapidly with redshift ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "a ) and b ) together lead to rapid condensation of small , dense gas clouds , which subsequently lose energy and ( orbital ) angular momentum by dynamical friction against the surrounding dark matter halo before they eventually merge to form the central disk .",
    "a mechanism is therefore needed that prevents , or at least delays , the collapse of small proto - galactic gas clouds and allows the gas to preserve a larger fraction of its angular momentum as it settles into the disk .",
    "weil , eke , & efstathiou ( 1998 ) have shown that if the early radiative cooling is suppressed ( by whatever means ) , numerical simulations can indeed yield more realistically sized disks  see also eke , efstathiou & wright ( 2000 ) .",
    "the physical mechanism by which cooling is suppressed or counteracted , however , was not specified .",
    "sommer - larsen et  al .",
    "( 1999 , hereafter slgv99 ) discussed the effects of various stellar reheating mechanisms in more detail using numerical treesph  simulations of disk galaxy formation in the scdm cosmology .",
    "they found that reheating of the universe resulting from more or less _ uniformly _ distributed star formation does not lead to a solution to the angular momentum ( am ) problem , but that localized star - bursts in proto - galactic gas clouds might : _ if _ the star - bursts can blow the remaining bulk part of the gas out of the small and dense dark matter haloes associated with the clouds , then test simulations showed that the gas later settles gradually forming an extended , high angular momentum disk galaxy in the central parts of a large , common dark matter halo .",
    "the physics of global gas blow - out processes were considered in early calculations by dekel & silk ( 1986 ) and yoshii & arimoto ( 1987 ) , indicating that star - bursts might well blow out most of the gas in small galaxies with characteristic circular speed ( defined in this paper as the circular speed in the disk at 2.2 exponential scalelengths ) @xmath17  100 km / s .",
    "more recent , detailed simulations by mac low & ferrara ( 1999 ) suggest that this global blow - out scenario may not work so well in _ disk _",
    "galaxies , even in small ones : the star - bursts typically lead to bipolar outflows of very hot gas perpendicular to the disk of the small galaxy , only expelling a minor fraction of the disk gas .",
    "this , however , is due to the particular geometry of a disk galaxy ( the thinness and flatness of the disk ) ; in a more roundish and bulky , proto - galactic dwarf galaxy , one would expect the energetic effects of star - bursts on the bulk of the dwarf galaxy gas to be much stronger .",
    "it has proven difficult to realistically implement thermal energy feedback in cosmological n - body / sph codes incorporating radiative cooling ( thacker & couchman 2000 and references therein ; navarro & steinmetz 2000 ; slgv99 ) . as first discussed by katz ( 1992 )",
    "this is mainly due to problems in resolving a multi - phase inter stellar medium ( ism ) at the scales of individual star burst regions in cosmological simulations using sph .",
    "it is also related to the smoothing of discontinuities in the thermodynamic variables inherent in the sph method  some improvement on this , at least in relation to shocks , may be gained by replacing thermal energy by entropy as an independent variable in sph ( springel & hernquist 2002 ) . in recent years , however , some progress has been made on the implementation of thermal energy feedback in sph simulations ( gerritsen 1997 ; mori et  al .",

    "2003 ) .",
    "as was shown by sommer - larsen & dolgov ( 2001 , sld01 ) by going from the cdm structure formation scenario to the warm dark matter ( wdm ) one can alleviate ( and possibly even completely overcome ) the am problem without invoking effects of energetic feedback in the simulations at all ( this does not imply , of course , that feedback necessarily _ is _ unimportant ; it should rather be seen as a minimal assumptions approach ) .",
    "fine - tuning of the warm dark matter particle mass to about 1 kev is required , however .",
    "in contrast , the salient feature about `` conventional '' cdm is that as long as the dark matter particles are much heavier than one kev , the actual particle mass does not matter for structure formation ( note though , that axions , despite being ultra - light , behave like cdm ) .    in this paper",
    "we show how a mix of realistic disk , lenticular and elliptical galaxies can be obtained in fully cosmological ( @xmath0cdm ) , gravity / hydro simulations invoking star formation , energetic stellar feedback processes in early , proto - galactic clouds and a meta - galactic uv field .",
    "this is achieved by treating ( albeit in a coarse way ) the gas in regions where star - bursts are returning energy to the ism as a two - phase medium , consisting of a `` cold '' ( @xmath18  k ) and a hot ( @xmath19  k ) component .",
    "related , recent work includes thacker & couchman ( 2001 ) , steinmetz & navarro ( 2002 ) and springel & hernquist ( 2003 ) .    in section  [",
    "s : feedback ] the implementation of stellar feedback processes in the simulations is discussed .",
    "section  [ s : methods ] gives a short presentation of the numerical code and the initial conditions .",
    "the simulations themselves are briefly described in section  [ s : simulations ] , and the results obtained are analyzed and discussed in section  [ s : results ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ s : conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions and present a brief outlook .",
    "the star formation efficiency ( sfe , defined as the ratio between the dynamical timescale and the star formation timescale  see below ) in the galactic disk is quite small at present , at most a few percent ( e.g. , silk 1997 ) .",
    "after extensive experimentation we have found that such a low sfe in combination with a `` conventional '' initial mass function ( imf ) produces too low an energy feedback rate in the early and dense proto - galactic clouds to drive the remaining gas out of the ( cold ) dark matter potential wells in which they have formed . as a consequence , such a low sfe at early times does not lead to a solution of the am problem for the cdm + feedback scenario - see section  [ s : results ] .",
    "a similar result was found by abadi et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) , but we note that governato et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) found for one cdm galaxy formation simulation , that the am problem could be solved ( to within about a factor of two ) using low , early sfe + feedback . in any case , for that scenario one is still faced with the problem that the stellar haloes become too massive ( governato et  al .",
    "2002 ) and/or the stellar spheroids too dominant and centrally concentrated ( abadi et  al .  2003",
    "; meza et  al .",
    "2003 ) . moreover , governato et  al .",
    "find for their cdm simulation that the number of stellar satellite galaxies is too large compared to observations of the milky way and m31 ( the `` missing satellites problem '' ) .    to solve the am problem ( to within about a factor of two ; section  [ s : results ] ) as well as the other problems mentioned above ( section  [ s : results ] ; sommer - larsen et  al .",
    "2003 ) we find that considerably larger energy feedback rates are required at early times .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , by invoking at early times 1 ) a considerably larger sfe or / and 2 ) a substantially more top - heavy imf . in this paper",
    ", we shall not attempt to give a detailed , theoretical substantiation of these two possibilities , but a few , brief plausibility arguments can be given as follows :    the stars formed in the early , proto - galactic clouds will have low heavy element abundance , as they will belong to the first generations of stars formed in the universe .",
    "hence a physical motivation for case 1 ) could be related to the fact that the strength of stellar winds decreases with decreasing metallicity ( kudritzki et  al .",
    "1989 ; kudritzki & puls 2000 ) , possibly with a sharp drop below metallicities of about 1/100 solar ( kudritzki 2002 ) .",
    "so for _ increasing _ metal abundance , the stronger stellar winds may regulate star formation so as to _ decrease _ the sfe , due to the energy and momentum feedback to the star forming , molecular clouds .",
    "it is also possible that the sfe could depend on the thermal history of the gas such that gas which has been heated to temperatures well above @xmath20@xmath11@xmath21  k ( below which atomic radiative cooling becomes unimportant ) and subsequently cooled down again has a lower sfe than gas which has never been heated above @xmath20 .",
    "physically this could be related to a possible multi - phase structure of the former type of gas , effects of magnetic fields , destruction of molecules etc .    with respect to case 2 )",
    "some theoretical work on star formation indicates that the imf of the first generations of stars was in fact more top - heavy than present day imfs ( abel , bryan & norman 2002 ; bromm , coppi & larson 2002 ; and references in chiosi 2000 ) .",
    "padoan & nordlund ( 2002 ) find that the high - mass slope of the imf becomes steeper at early times ( when the magnetic fields in molecular clouds were considerably weaker than the @xmath22 g at present ) , but also that the low - mass cut - off of the imf at the same time increases considerably such as to effectively make their proposed imf more top - heavy ( or more appropriately `` bottom - light '' ) at early times (  .",
    "nordlund , 2002 , private communication ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider case 1 ) , but we have no reason to believe that case 2 ) would not work equally well .",
    "we use two distinctly different star formation and feedback modes depending on the thermal history of the star forming gas ( as chemical evolution is not yet implemented in the simulations ) :    @xmath23 `` early '' star formation mode    cool , dense gas , which has _ always _ been cooler than @xmath24 k is assumed to form stars rapidly , i.e. on a timescale comparable to the local , dynamical time @xmath25 .",
    "we express this star formation timescale as @xmath26 where the star formation efficiency @xmath27 ( we find that the specific value of @xmath28 used is not critical for the outcome of the simulations as long as @xmath27 ; we have used @xmath29 in this work ) . such fast star formation is assumed to be triggered when the gas density of an sph particle exceeds a certain critical value , chosen to be @xmath30 @xmath31 ; we have experimented with other values and found that the outcome of the simulations is very robust to changes in this parameter . in a star formation event",
    "an sph particle is converted fully into a collisionless star particle of the same mass , thereby conserving the total number of particles in the simulation .",
    "the star particle remains a star for the rest of the simulation  non - instantaneous recycling is being implemented in a forthcoming version of the code .",
    "the moment of conversion from sph to star particle is , as is customary , determined by a probabilistic approach .",
    "the triggering of an sph particle for star formation may ( a ) or may not ( b ) trigger a burst of self - propagating star formation ( spsf ) in the cold , dense gas surrounding it : in scenario `` a '' not only the sph particle which gets above the critical density threshold , but also its neighbouring cold and dense sph particles with densities above @xmath32 are triggered for conversion into star particles on their individual , dynamical timescales .",
    "such self - propagating star formation is observed at present in some star - burst galaxies ( e.g. , in expanding super - shells  see mori et  al .",
    "spsf is likely to have been more common at early times ( when metallicities were lower and the ism more homogeneous )  see mccray & kafatos ( 1987 ) .",
    "we stress that the above implementation of spsf is just a simple , schematic way of modelling complicated ( sub - resolution ) physical processes .    for scenario `` a '' we ran 4 series of simulations with @xmath33= 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 and 0.25 @xmath31 respectively , corresponding to the conversion of approximately 5 , 4 , 3 and 2% of the gas mass initially in the simulation into stars at @xmath34 ; we dub this the `` population iii '' scenario .",
    "the 4 different values of @xmath33 were used to control the strength of the star - bursts to check whether the outcome of the simulations was sensitive to the choice of this parameter . in particular",
    "we wanted to check whether considerable fine - tuning is required to solve the am problem .",
    "early star - bursts converting more than about 5% of the initial gas into stars lead to halo star metallicities which are too large compared to observations ( see section 5.2 and also slgv99 ) , so this sets an upper limit to the strength of the early star - bursts .    in scenario `` b '' only the initial sph particle above the critical density threshold is triggered for star formation on the dynamical time scale  we dub this the `` population ii '' scenario .",
    "when a star particle is formed , it is assumed to represent a population of stars born at the same time in accordance with a salpeter imf .",
    "it will hence feed energy back to the local ism : during the first 5 myr only stellar winds are assumed to contribute , during the subsequent about 35 myr also ( and more importantly ) type ii supernova explosions as well ( the lightest stars which explode as snii have a mass of about 8 @xmath35 and a lifetime of about 40 myr ) .",
    "only stars with masses greater than 30 @xmath35 are assumed to contribute significant amounts of energy to the ism through winds , and such stars are assumed to deposit a total of 10@xmath36 ergs per star over their lifetime .",
    "stars with masses greater than 8 @xmath35 are assumed to deposit 10@xmath37 ergs per star to the ism as they explode as snii at the end of their lifetime .",
    "the energy from the `` star - burst '' is deposited in the ism as thermal energy at a constant rate over the lifetime of the burst , which is taken to be the above mentioned about 40 myr ( mori et  al .",
    "the burst energy is fed back to the , at any given time ( @xmath3840 myr ) , 50 nearest sph particles using the smoothing kernel of monaghan & lattanzio ( 1985 ) .",
    "part of the thermal energy is subsequently converted into kinetic energy ( by the code ) as the resulting `` super - shell '' expands .",
    "while a star particle is feeding energy back to its neighbouring sph particles , radiative cooling of these is switched off - this is an effective way of modelling with sph a two - phase ism consisting of a hot component ( @xmath39 k ) and a much cooler component ( @xmath18 k )  see mori et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) ; gerritsen ( 1997 ) and thacker & couchman ( 2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "scenario `` a '' above typically leads to complete `` blow - away '' of the remaining gas in the proto - galactic `` dwarf '' galaxy hosting the star - burst , whereas scenario `` b '' is much more gentle , but still leads to a considerable lowering of the density of the remaining gas .",
    "@xmath23 `` late '' star formation mode    the gas which forms the disks of disk galaxies through smooth , dilute and fairly well ordered cooling flows has typically been heated to temperatures well above @xmath20 and has subsequently cooled down and settled onto the disk to become potentially star forming .",
    "such gas is assumed to form stars on a much slower timescale @xmath40 where @xmath411 . as discussed previously ,",
    "such a large change of sfe between early and late phases of galaxy formation is in our experience required to form disks with the densities , radial and vertical structures , cold gas fractions , sizes and morphologies of observed disk galaxies at present .",
    "a value of @xmath42=0.0025 was adopted in order to obtain ( cold ) gas fractions in the disk galaxies at @xmath43 consistent with observational estimates ( e.g. , sommer - larsen 1996 : the gas fraction ( by mass ) in sa - sc galaxies is @xmath110.10 - 0.25  the mean of our 28 spsf disk galaxy runs ( see section 4 ) is 0.17@xmath440.01% , the dispersion 0.07 ) .",
    "this adopted value of @xmath42 is somewhat low ; we expect it to increase when non - instantaneous recycling of gas is properly taken into account in the simulations .",
    "star formation through this `` channel '' is assumed to take place down to a quite low density threshold of 0.01 @xmath31 .",
    "this , however , is still large enough to ensure that the gas has cooled down to a temperature @xmath45@xmath1110@xmath46 k , at which the radiative cooling function is effectively truncated .",
    "for the ( typically disk forming ) star particles formed through this slow mode feedback was completely switched off .",
    "this is a crude , but effective way of modelling in our simulations the results of mac low & ferrara ( 1999 ) obtained at much higher resolution , that for star - bursts in a well - organized , cold gas _ disk _ only a small fraction of the feedback energy is deposited in surrounding cold gas .",

    "as can be seen from the figure , the specific angular momenta of the stellar disks lie only about a factor of three below the observed median .",
    "this is about an order of magnitude better than what is obtained in similar cdm simulations not invoking stellar feedback processes , as discussed by many authors ( e.g. , navarro , frenk , & white 1995 ; slgv99 ) .",

    "fall & efstathiou ( 1980 ) proposed that the angular momentum of a disk galaxy should be proportional to the spin - parameter of its dark matter halo , and indeed a positive correlation is seen in figure  5 , although the scatter is considerable ( the linear correlation coefficient is 0.51 , so the probability that @xmath83 and @xmath85 are uncorrelated is less than 3% ) . filled triangles , squares , pentagons and circles correspond to @xmath69 = 0.05 , 0.10 , 0.20 and 0.25 @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "it is clear from the figure that there is no statistically significant evidence that one particular choice of the parameter @xmath69 leads to a better solution of the am problem than the other .",

    "we also show the results of the 7 constant , low sfe ( @xmath76=0.02 ) disk galaxy runs - these are in general giving very poor results in terms of solving the am problem : the mean , spin - parameter corrected ( see below ) , normalized angular momentum of these 7 runs is just 27@xmath446% of that of the 28 spsf runs .",
    "the spin - parameters of our 7 disk galaxy haloes are on average somewhat smaller than the median found in cosmological n - body simulations  see below .",
    "this is most likely just an effect of small number statistics . assuming ( simplisticly ) a linear relationship between @xmath83 and @xmath85 on the basis of the trend seen in fig .",
    "5 we correct the normalized specific angular momenta of the 28 disk galaxies formed in the spsf simulations as follows to see how well we can expect to do in solving the am problem .",
    "we assume a theoretical median value of @xmath87 of 0.05 ( barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; heavens & peacock 1988 ) and hence multiply the normalized specific angular momenta of 28 disk galaxies by ( 0.05/@xmath85 ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure  7 .",
    "it is seen that the disk galaxies formed in spsf simulations are really only deficient in specific angular momentum by about a factor of two relative to the observed median .",

    "although we are making an appropriate comparison between `` observational '' _ disk _ specific angular momenta and model _ disk _ specific angular momenta ( both obtained through b / d decomposition ) we note that some authors present total ( disk+bulge ) specific angular momenta for simulated galaxies .",
    "for comparison with these works we calculated @xmath88 for the 35 model disk galaxies and found @xmath89 , so the difference between the two types of specific angular momenta is quite small .    in figure  8",

    "another potential disk galaxy type diagnostic is the so - called birthrate parameter , @xmath96 , defined as the ratio of the present to past average star formation rate , , for the _ disk _ stars  see kennicutt , tamblyn & congdon ( 1994 ) and references therein . in figure  11 we show the mean @xmath96 versus hubble type ( @xmath45=17 ) for the data given in kennicutt et  al .",

    "12 is consistent with the weak trend found observationally for @xmath94 ( and also for @xmath100-band @xmath91 ratios , e.g. , de jong 1996 ) , when allowing for the large dispersion in each bin seen in fig .",
    "as mentioned previously , since @xmath80 is comparable to the gravitational softening lengths , the structural bulge / disk decompositions can be affected by spurious effects of gravity softening ( e.g. , bate & burkert 1997 ; sommer - larsen , vedel & hellsten 1998a , b ) . to test for such effects we performed the following experiments : switching star formation off and slowly reducing the softening lengths to final values half of the initial ( which were 1.3 @xmath57kpc for the gas ( and star ) particles and 2.8 @xmath57kpc for dm particles ) ,",
    "we continued the 7 disk galaxy spsf runs with @xmath69 = 0.20 @xmath31 for one additional gyr , starting at @xmath1=0 . as the orbital time scale in the bulge and the main disk is considerably less than 1 gyr the angular momentum distribution of the collisionless components ( stars and dark matter ) will be approximately preserved , as angular momenta are adiabatic invariants .",
    "we then performed the bulge / disk decomposition of the resulting 7 disk galaxies as before and found that the mean @xmath91 increased by 0.20@xmath440.07 ( up from 0.20 to 0.40 ) , the mean @xmath101 by 0.07@xmath440.16 kpc and the mean disk @xmath102 by 38@xmath4473 kpc km / s ( up from 229 to 267 kpc km / s ) as the softening lengths were reduced by a factor of two .",
    "we do not expect any significant further changes if the softening lengths were reduced even more since now @xmath103 and the central gravitational potential is completely dominated by stars and gas .",
    "so a statistically significant increase in the mean @xmath91 ratio results from going to smaller softening lengths , bringing it in better agreement with the recent estimate of @xmath1040.6 for the _ mass _ @xmath91 ratio independent of disk galaxy type ( portinari , sommer - larsen & tantalo 2003 ) . as a consequence the resulting _ disk _ @xmath102",
    "would be expected to increase somewhat .",
    "this is indeed hinted by the above results though the statistical significance of this can not be established on the basis of the present 7 experiments .",
    "the disk scale lengths appear to be only slightly overestimated ( by 6@xmath4414% ) .",
    "besides the birthrate parameter , a variety of other characteristics of observed galaxies is known to depend on their hubble type ( see e.g.  the review by roberts & haynes 1994 ) . in this section",
    "we discuss the integrated @xmath3@xmath4 colours of our simulated disk galaxies .",
    "we estimate their colours `` post - process '' : first we calculate the average chemical enrichment history of each galaxy on the basis of its star formation history ( sfh ) , inferred from the age distribution of the stars in the final galaxy ( inside of @xmath105=30 kpc ) at @xmath43 .",
    "once the metallicity evolution @xmath106 is computed , we derive from the star formation rate @xmath107 of the galaxy its integrated luminosity @xmath108 in any given passband as : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the age of the galaxy and @xmath111 is the luminosity of a single stellar population ( ssp ; tinsley 1980 ; renzini & buzzoni 1986 ) of age @xmath112 and metallicity @xmath113 . in the following we give further details on the individual ingredients in calculating the @xmath3@xmath4 colours .      the metal enrichment is calculated post - process , with the purpose of obtaining an approximate estimate of the integrated @xmath3@xmath4 colours of the disk galaxies .",
    "some level of global pre - enrichment is expected from the initial `` fast '' star formation activity responsible for the early feedback effects ( see section  2 ) .",
    "this early star formation is localized in the cool gas clouds but otherwise widely distributed over the simulation volume ; it typically peaks at redshifts @xmath1@xmath1168 ( for the spsf runs  see section 5.4 ) , followed by a more gentle level of activity .",
    "a second phase of star formation , associated with the formation of the main galaxy itself , commences at redshifts @xmath114 . as a first approximation one can hence divide the star formation and chemical enrichment history into two phases : an early phase resulting in fairly uniform metal ( pre)enrichment of the simulation volume and a second corresponding to the formation of the main galaxy .",
    "the level of pre - enrichment is calculated with a chemical evolution model representing a closed - box with the same sfh as that of the entire simulation volume .",
    "we use the chemical evolution model by portinari , chiosi & bressan ( 1998 ) , suitably modified so as to treat the sfh @xmath107 as an input information , rather than calculating its own star formation rate after a prescribed schmidt - like law . a salpeter initial mass function ( imf )",
    "is assumed throughout the calculations , with logarithmic slope 1.35 and mass limits 0.1100  @xmath115  .",
    "the metallicity of the closed - box at @xmath1161.5  gyr ( @xmath117 ) is taken as the level of pre - enrichment for the subsequent second phase of main galaxy formation .",
    "we obtain levels of pre - enrichment in the range 1/100 to 1/20  @xmath118 ( increasing as the strength of the early star - bursts increases , causing a larger fraction of gas to be converted into stars during this early phase  see section 2 ) , with 1/40  @xmath118 as the typical value .",
    "starting from the appropriate initial metallicity level , we then calculate the chemical evolution of the main galaxy based on its sfh during the remaining 13  gyr ( from 1.5 to 14.5  gyr ) .",
    "the sfh is directly provided by the age distribution of the star particles that reside in the galaxy at the end of the simulation . for the chemical evolution of the main galaxy , the closed - box assumption would be too crude an approximation : not all the baryons that end up in the final galaxy are immediately and equally available for star formation since the beginning , as the closed - box model would presume . realistically",
    ", what happens is that gas progressively cools out and becomes available for star formation ( @xmath18 k , @xmath119 @xmath31 ) .",
    "we can regard this `` cool out '' as a sort of `` infall history '' for the galaxy .",
    "we estimate the accretion history of cold gas onto the main galaxy as follows . at each time",
    "@xmath120 , we know the total amount of cold gas in the simulation volume , @xmath121 , as well as the total star formation rate @xmath122 , and the sfh of the stars that end up in the galaxy , @xmath107 . the rate at which cold , dense gas becomes available for the star formation relevant to the main galaxy , is simply approximated by : @xmath123 hence we calculate the chemical evolution of the galaxy assuming an infall model with a mass accretion history given by : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the mass of the stars in the final galaxy that were formed up to time @xmath120 .",
    "to do so , we further adapted the chemical evolution model by portinari et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) so that it could treat not only the sfh , but also the accretion history as input data , in place of the usual prescription .",
    "post - process calculation of chemical evolution introduces some inconsistency with respect to the results of dynamical simulations , since the chemical model accounts for the gas re - ejection from dying stars , which is neglected in the simulations .",
    "hence , for the same sfh the two models will end up with a somewhat different gas versus star content .",
    "for the salpeter imf adopted here , a ssp restitutes @xmath1130% of its mass to the gaseous phase over a hubble time , hence this is the order of magnitude of the discrepancy between the final mass in stars in the chemical model and in the dynamical simulation .",
    "a consistent calculation of the metallicity distribution of the stars in the galaxy would require chemical evolution to be implemented in the simulations , so that each star particle is consistently labelled with its own age and metallicity and can be individually treated as a ssp for the sake of colour calculation .",
    "this is currently being implemented in the code .",
    "the above mentioned mismatch in final mass in stars , however , mostly affects the integrated magnitude of a galaxy , while its colour is only marginally sensitive to the slightly different metal enrichment for different gas fractions . hence , for the purpose of this paper our post - process estimate of the colours is adequate .      the chemical evolution calculated above provides us with the metal enrichment history @xmath106 of the galaxy , which combined with its known sfh @xmath107 allows us to calculate its integrated luminosity from eq .  ( [ integl ] ) . as to @xmath126",
    ", we adopt the magnitudes and colours of the ssps by tantalo et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "the @xmath3@xmath4 colours , calculated as described above , do not include the effects of dust and gas re - processing of the stellar radiation , which can be crucial especially for the youngest stellar populations .",
    "in particular , there is evidence from studies of combined dust extinction and ir re - emission that the youngest stellar populations can be heavily obscured by the parent clouds for periods of up to a few @xmath127yr ( e.g.  silva et  al .",
    "1998 ; charlot & fall 2000 ) . in the current paper",
    "we deal with this effect in the following simple way : we calculate the @xmath3@xmath4 colour for each galaxy by including all stars formed to the present ( corresponding to no `` dust correction '' at all ) and by dropping the light contribution of the stars formed in the last @xmath128  yr ; we consider the range of colours we obtain as our uncertainty and denote the mean of the two values ( @xmath3@xmath4)@xmath129 . as to the extinction from the diffuse gas phase , the reddening effect on @xmath3@xmath4 for spiral disks is mild ( e.g.  boissier & prantzos 1999 ) and moreover the observed colours from roberts & haynes which we use for comparison are the rc3 catalogue `` intrinsic '' ( @xmath3@xmath4)@xmath129 colours , which have been corrected for internal extinction .",
    "further uncertainties and systematic effects on the colours may come from the choice of the imf , which influences the level of chemical enrichment .",
    "dynamical arguments favour a rather low m / l ratio in spiral galaxies , both for external galaxies and for our milky way ( sommer - larsen & dolgov 2001 and references therein  see also section 5.3 ) , implying a more bottom - light imf than the standard salpeter one adopted here .",
    "a variety of studies in fact suggest the the slope of the imf gets much shallower than the salpeter value below 1  @xmath115  ( e.g.  kroupa et  al .  1993 ; chabrier 2003 ) . in the present paper , however , we consistently use a salpeter imf since our main purpose is to discuss the _ trend _ of the @xmath3@xmath4 colours with respect to other galactic properties , such as hubble type etc .",
    "finally , systematic differences in the broad - band colours of ssps among different authors exist , while better agreement is found for the differential variation of ssp colors with age and metallicity ( e.g.  charlot , worthey & bressan 1996 ; kodama & arimoto 1998 ) .",
    "so , given the above - mentioned sources of uncertainty ( dust , imf and theoretical ssps ) the _ trend _ of broad - band colours with the properties of simulated galaxies is to be considered more robust than their absolute values .",
    "the @xmath3@xmath4 colours we obtain are compared to the observed ones from the review by roberts & haynes ( 1994 ) , which is based on a large sample of galaxies compiled from the rc3 catalogue .",
    "we use the disk galaxy birthrate parameter @xmath96 as our morphology indicator and convert from the observational morphological type @xmath45 to @xmath96 as described at the end of section  5.1 ( using eq .  3 ) .    in figure  13",

    "the disk age dispersion is @xmath11  2 - 3 gyr corresponding to a dispersion in redshift of @xmath11  0.3 - 0.4 . at first",
    "it seems surprising that a disk , forming inside - out , has no age gradient . however , firstly the star formation history is generally different from the gas accretion history , and secondly the star formation rate depends non - linearly on the cold gas density , @xmath179 ( cf .",
    "eq .  2 ) .",
    "this makes the star formation rate quite low in the outer disk at late times and hence the average stellar age quite high there ( but some young stars are present  see below ) .",

    "the mean age of the disk stars inside of @xmath182 , with @xmath183  2.6 and excluding the two innermost bins , which have some bulge contribution , is 7.3 gyr for s1 .",
    "this corresponds to a mean disk star formation redshift of @xmath184  0.8 , so for this galaxy even the formation of the bulk of the _ stellar _ disk happens at @xmath10  1 . for galaxy s2 ,",
    "the corresponding number is 4.9 gyr , so for this galaxy the stellar disk is arguably still forming  its present sfr is also quite respectable , cf .",
    "table 2 .",
    "finally , our results above on age gradients indicate that the colour gradients observed in galactic disks ( with the disk generally becoming bluer with increasing @xmath157 ) are a metallicity effect , rather than an age effect .",
    "observational studies of the metallicity distribution of g and k stars in the solar neighbourhood show that the distribution is very narrow ( peaking around wyse & gilmore 1995 ; rocha - pinto & maciel 1996 ; hou et  al .  1998",

    "2002 ) , much too narrow to be consistent with what is expected from a simple , closed - box model of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "this famous , apparent inconsistency has been coined the `` g - dwarf problem '' and was first discussed by van den bergh ( 1962 ) , schmidt ( 1963 ) and pagel & patchett ( 1975 ) .",
    "the currently most popular ( and very sensible  see below ) answer to the g - dwarf problem is to assume that the solar neighbourhood was formed gradually over the hubble time through prolonged infall of fairly low metallicity cooled - out gas originating from the hot halo ; such `` infall models '' were first introduced by larson ( 1972 ) and lynden - bell ( 1975 ) .",
    "assuming , as is often done for simplicity , that the infall rate is an exponentially decaying function of time an infall timescale of @xmath185=710  gyr is required to get the models to match recent observations ( chiappini et  al .",
    "1997 ; portinari et  al .  1998 ; boissier & prantzos 1999 ) . if a gaussian form for the infall rate is assumed , then the typical timescale is @xmath115  gyr ( prantzos & silk 1998 ; chang et  al .",
    "1999 ) . with the current models we are able to test these assumptions :    in figure   20 and 21",
    "we show the histories of accretion of cooled - out gas for the disks of galaxies s1 and s2 , respectively . in each figure",
    "we show by solid line the accretion rate history of the entire disk and by dotted that of the `` solar cylinder '' ( operationally defined as 2.1@xmath101@xmath186@xmath157@xmath1863.2@xmath101 ; we assume that the scalelength of the galactic disk is 3.0 kpc , as a compromise between various recent determinations , and that the solar circle is at @xmath187=8.0 kpc ) .",
    "for s1 the rate of gas infall onto the `` solar cylinder '' is almost perfectly exponentially decaying with an e - folding time of @xmath11  5 gyr ( the earliest bin in the figures correspond to @xmath1=2.2 ) . for s2",
    "the infall history looks more like the one derived by prantzos & silk ( 2003 ) for the solar cylinder using a combination of observational data and theoretical arguments . from a linear fit to the infall rate history of the `` solar cylinder '' over the age range 012 gyr we derive an infall timescale of @xmath11  6 gyr .",
    "so the infall timescales derived fall short of the 710 gyr required by current chemical evolution models , but only marginally so .",
    "moreover , we remind the reader again that we have been analyzing just two milky way like disk galaxies in detail .      the amount of hot gas ( @xmath19 k ) in the galactic halo can be constrained from dispersion measures to pulsars in the galactic halo .",
    "of particular interest is one pulsar in the high latitude globular cluster m53 and three in the lmc ( large magellanic cloud ) , because the distances to these pulsars are known .",
    "rasmussen ( 2000 ) finds from these data and some modelling of the hot halo an upper limit on the cumulative amount of hot gas to the distance of the lmc of 1.52@xmath15210@xmath188 m@xmath8 . in figure  22",
    "we show the cumulative mass of hot gas vs. galactocentric distance for three milky way like disk galaxies .",
    "solid curves are for gas with @xmath189 k , dotted for top set of curves are for disk galaxy s2 , middle for s1 and lower are for a simulation of spsf type of the halo corresponding to galaxy s1 , but with a gas abundance of 1/3 solar ( see toft et  al .",
    "2002 ) , rather than the primordial gas abundance used in this work .",
    "it is clear that all three hot gas haloes satisfy the above constraint increasingly so with increasing gas abundance , as discussed by toft et  al .     with the present models we can ,",
    "however , do better than this , because we can `` insert '' m53 and the lmc in our model galaxy haloes and calculate the expected dispersion measures directly :    for electromagnetic waves propagating through a plasma , the group velocity @xmath190 will depend on the frequency @xmath191 of the radiation .",
    "specifically , for radio waves in an unmagnetized plasma ( e.g. , flthammer 1995 ) @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the electron plasma frequency , @xmath194 the electron charge , @xmath195 the mass of the electron and @xmath196 the speed of light . a pulse travelling a distance @xmath108 in the plasma will have a travel time @xmath120 given approximately by @xmath197 rather than the `` vacuum value '' @xmath198 ( e.g. , spitzer 1978 ) , where the _ dispersion measure _ @xmath199 is defined as @xmath200 detected radio signals from pulsars show a frequency - dependent delay that can be used to evaluate @xmath199 . for the pulsar in the globular cluster m53 , located at a distance of @xmath20118.9 kpc at @xmath202 = ( 333@xmath203,80@xmath203 ) one finds @xmath199=24.0 @xmath31  pc .",

    "we predict to m53 and the lmc for the haloes of s1 and s2 we average over the hot halo gas free electron densities in spherical shells and correct the densities for resolution effects at the disk - halo interface .",
    "we calculate @xmath199 as the average of the value at @xmath1=0 and the values obtained at times 100 and 200 myr prior to this .",
    "one has to adopt a value for @xmath187 , the distance of the sun from the galactic center , when calculating @xmath199 for the model galaxies .",
    "though the _ stellar _ disks are too small compared to reality , this is not necessarily the case for the hot halo .",
    "we hence did the calculations of @xmath199 with two values of @xmath187=5 and 8 kpc .",
    "for the m53 pulsar we find for s1 24@xmath442 and 16@xmath441 and for s2 28@xmath441 and 17@xmath441 @xmath31  pc for @xmath187=5 and 8 kpc , respectively , in fairly good agreement with the observed value .",

    "these values are considerably smaller than the observed @xmath199  this is probably due to additional contributions to the observed @xmath199 from the gum nebula , a largely ionized region at @xmath205 230@xmath203 - 290@xmath203 and distance of about 0.5 kpc ( taylor & cordes 1993 ) , and the diffuse , ionized reynolds - layer ( reynolds 1993 ) in the direction towards the lmc ( rasmussen 2000 ) .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "22 and the discussion in toft et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) that the predicted values of @xmath199 above are upper limits in the sense that had we included chemical evolution in the simulations it would have lead to some non - zero level of metal enrichment in the hot halo gas , which in turn would have caused a reduction in the predicted values of @xmath199 .      as an example of the typical star formation histories in our simulations we show ( for the _ same _ dark matter halo ) in figure  23 the star formation rate in units of the current one for three of the five simulations resulting in the largest disk galaxy ( with @xmath158 220230 km / s ) .",
    "two are with self - propagating star formation with @xmath69=0.05 and 0.25 @xmath31 and one is for the simulation without self - propagating star formation .",
    "all three reproduce the observed peak in the sfr history at @xmath1@xmath112 ( madau et  al .",
    "1996 ) , but whereas the simulations with self - propagating star formation have a low at @xmath1@xmath114.55.5 and another peak at @xmath1@xmath1168 corresponding to the putative population iii , the one without self propagating star formation has a monotonically decreasing sfr with increasing redshift . though it would obviously be premature to take the star formation histories of our simulations of the formation and evolution of _ individual _ and fairly large galaxies as representative of the sfh of the universe as a whole , our results suggest that the global sfh could possibly be bimodal . in relation to this",
    "it is interesting that recent observations of high-@xmath1 quasars may indicate that the universe was reionized at a redshift of about 6 ( becker et  al .",
    "2001 ; djorgovski et  al .  2001",
    "; but see also hu et  al .  2002 , who advocate @xmath206  6.6 from observations of a candidate @xmath1=6.56 galaxy ; this is , however , still consistent with the location of the second sfr peak discussed above ) .",
    "the different sfh scenarios should be observationally constrainable with upcoming instruments like jwst and alma .      to check for effects of numerical resolution we did the following two tests :    \\1 .",
    "we ran a series of 7 spsf disk galaxy formation simulations with @xmath69=0.2 and with gravitational softening lengths equal to half the `` standard '' values , i.e. and 1.4 @xmath57kpc for the sph ( and star ) and active dm particles , respectively .",
    "the median normalized stellar specific angular momentum was 11@xmath4415% lower than for the `` standard '' simulations .",
    "this was mostly due to the median @xmath81 being 4@xmath4412% larger than for the standard simulations .",
    "so there may be a small ( and statistically insignificant ) effect of the gravitational softening on the resulting normalized specific angular momenta - but see below .",
    "the second test was to re - simulate one of our disk galaxies , which we shall denote s3 in the following , at 8 times higher mass and 4 times higher force resolution , as detailed at the end of section 4 .",
    "we shall denote the higher mass and force resolution version of s3 by s3 - 8 in the following .",
    "masses , numbers of particles and other physical characteristics of s3 and s3 - 8 at @xmath1=0 are given in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the total ( baryonic ) masses of s3 and s3 - 8 are very similar , differing by less than 5% .",
    "the stellar mass of s3 - 8 is 11% larger than that of s3 and the cold gas mass correspondingly smaller .",
    "we believe that it is the combination of the ability to resolve gas clouds of smaller masses and the additional small scale power that leads to the somewhat higher stellar mass and correspondingly lower cold gas mass of the high resolution galaxy s3 - 8 relative to s3 . the characteristic circular speed of s3 - 8 is just 2% larger than that of s3 despite the 4 times higher force resolution .",
    "this may indicate that force resolution used in our `` standard '' simulations is adequate .",
    "the bulge - to - disk ratio of s3 - 8 is b / d=0.28@xmath440.13 . to obtain the @xmath102 and @xmath101 given in table 2 for s3 we forced the bulge - to - disk decomposition to have b / d=0.28 for s3 to enable a fair comparison between s3 and s3 - 8 .",
    "we find that @xmath102 for s3 - 8 is 5@xmath448% larger than that of s3 and that the specific angular momentum of the cold gas @xmath207 is 41% larger .",
    "the gas accretion rate is somewhat lower ( this is presumably related to the larger stellar mass and smaller cold gas mass of s3 - 8 relative to s3 ) and the star formation rates and birthrate parameters , @xmath96 , are very similar .",
    "we conclude that the high mass resolution simulation generally is in good agreement with the `` standard '' resolution one , with a tendency for the stellar mass to be somewhat larger , the cold gas mass somewhat smaller and the specific angular momenta somewhat larger .",
    "all in all it is hence possible that increased mass resolution will be beneficial also with respect to the am problem .",
    "in conclusion we have obtained a mix of realistic disk , lenticular and elliptical galaxies in our @xmath0cdm galaxy formation simulations with effects of energetic stellar feedback processes included .",
    "we find that the disk galaxy angular momentum problem can be considerably alleviated ( though not entirely solved as yet ) in this way , provided that the early star - bursts are fairly strong , converting 2 - 5% of the initial gas mass into stars .",
    "for early star - burst strengths in this range , the improvement on the am problem is about the same , so extreme fine - tuning of the feedback seems not required .",
    "the stellar disks have approximately exponential surface density profiles and those of the bulges range from exponential to @xmath2 , as observed . the bulge - to - disk ratios of the disk galaxies are consistent with observations and likewise are their integrated @xmath3@xmath4 colours , which have been calculated in a simplified way ( `` post - process '' ) using stellar population synthesis techniques",
    ". furthermore we can match the observed @xmath5-band tully - fisher relation , provided that the stellar mass - to - light ratio of disk galaxies is @xmath6 0.8 , similar to what was found by sommer - larsen & dolgov ( 2001 ) from their wdm simulations and in fair agreement with several recent observational determinations of @xmath7 for disk galaxies .",
    "the ellipticals and lenticulars have approximately @xmath2 stellar surface density profiles , are dominated by non disk - like kinematics and flattened due to non - isotropic , stellar velocity distributions , again consistent with observations .",
    "we predict that hot halo gas is cooling out and being accreted onto the galactic disk at a rate of at @xmath1=0 , consistent with upper limits deduced from @xmath9 observations of ovi .",
    "we have analyzed the formation history of two milky way like disk galaxies in detail and find gas accretion rates , and hence bolometric x - ray luminosities of the haloes , 67 times larger at than at @xmath1=0 for these disk galaxies .",
    "more generally , we find that gas infall rates onto these disks are nearly exponentially declining with time , both for the total disk and the `` solar cylinder '' .",
    "this theoretical result hence supports the exponentially declining gas infall approximation often used in chemical evolution models .",
    "the infall time - scales deduced are @xmath1156 gyr , comparable to what is adopted in current chemical evolution models to solve the `` g - dwarf problem '' .",
    "it is moreover found for these two galaxies that galactic disks can form `` inside - out '' as well as `` outside - in '' , but in both cases the mean ages of the stars in the outskirts of the disks are @xmath1268 gyr , broadly consistent with the findings of ferguson & johnson for the disk of m31 .",
    "the amount of hot gas in disk galaxy haloes is consistent with observational upper limits .",
    "we `` insert '' the globular cluster m53 and the lmc in the haloes of the two milky way like disk galaxies and calculate dispersion measures to these objects",
    ". our results are consistent with upper limits from observed dispersion measures to pulsars in these systems .",
    "our simulations indicate that we can reproduce the observed peak in the cosmic star formation rate at redshift @xmath13 .",
    "depending on the star formation and feedback scenarios we predict either a monotonically decreasing cosmic star formation rate beyond these redshifts or a second peak at @xmath1@xmath1168 corresponding to the putative population iii and interestingly similar to recent estimates of the redshift at which the universe was reionized .",
    "these various scenarios should hence be observationally constrainable with upcoming instruments like jwst and alma .    in this paper",
    "we have mainly been concerned with the present day properties of the simulated disk galaxies .",
    "we shall in forthcoming papers study the present day properties of the e / s0s in detail as well as the dynamics of all types of galaxies .",
    "in particular , we intend to study the kinematics and dynamics of the stellar haloes of milky way like disk galaxies to compare with current models of the galactic stellar halo ( e.g. , sommer - larsen et  al .  1997 ; helmi & white 1999 ; helmi et  al .",
    "we will also study the higher redshift properties of all types of galaxies and the properties of medium to damped ly@xmath150 systems predicted by our simulations .",
    "moreover , we will incorporate chemical evolution including non - instantaneous gas and heavy element recycling in the simulations and replace thermal energy by entropy as an independent variable in sph ( springel & hernquist 2002 ) .",
    "last , but not least we will also study much more closely the physical factors determining the final hubble type of the galaxies formed .",
    "it is , however , already at this point clear from our simulations that final galaxy morphologies primarily reflect the merging histories of the galaxies in the sense of the very _ detailed _ merging histories  just to give an example , we find that even major merging sometimes can be _ constructive _ in forming disk galaxies with extended disks .",
    "another interesting result is that whereas the mean spin - parameter for the 5 spheroid dominated systems ( e / s0 ) is @xmath208=0.043@xmath440.005 , it is @xmath209=0.037@xmath440.002 for the 35 disk galaxies . hence our results do not seem to support the notion that the dm haloes in which disk galaxies form on average have larger spin - parameters than the haloes of early type galaxies ( e.g. , mo , mao & white 1998 ; van den bosch 1998 ) . +",

    "<S> treesph   simulations of galaxy formation in a standard @xmath0cdm cosmology , including star formation , effects of energetic stellar feedback processes and of a meta - galactic uv field have been performed , resulting in a mix of realistic disk , lenticular and elliptical galaxies at redshift @xmath1=0 .    </S>",
    "<S> the disk galaxies are deficient in angular momentum by only about a factor of two compared to observed disk galaxies for simulations with fairly strong star - bursts in early , proto - galactic clouds , leading to `` blow - away '' of the remaining gas in the clouds . in this respect </S>",
    "<S> the present scenario is hence doing almost as well as the wdm scenarios discussed by sommer - larsen & dolgov . </S>",
    "<S> the surface density profiles of the stellar disks are approximately exponential and those of the bulges range from exponential to @xmath2 , as observed </S>",
    "<S> . the bulge - to - disk ratios of the disk galaxies are consistent with observations and likewise are their integrated @xmath3@xmath4 colours , which have been calculated using stellar population synthesis techniques . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the observed @xmath5-band tully - fisher relation can be matched , provided that the stellar mass - to - light ratio of disk galaxies is @xmath6 0.8 , similar to what was found by sommer - larsen & dolgov from their wdm simulations and in fair agreement with several recent observational determinations of @xmath7 for disk galaxies .    </S>",
    "<S> the ellipticals and lenticulars have approximately @xmath2 stellar surface density profiles , are dominated by non disk - like kinematics and flattened due to non - isotropic stellar velocity distributions , again consistent with observations .    </S>",
    "<S> hot halo gas is predicted to cool out and be accreted onto the galactic disk at a rate of 0.51 m@xmath8/yr at @xmath1=0 , consistent with upper limits deduced from @xmath9 observations of ovi . </S>",
    "<S> we have analyzed in detail the formation history of two disk galaxies with circular speeds comparable to that of the milky way and find gas accretion rates , and hence bolometric x - ray luminosities of the haloes , 67 times larger at @xmath10 1 than at @xmath1=0 for these disk galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , it is found that gas infall rates onto these disks are nearly exponentially declining with time , both for the total disk and the `` solar cylinder '' . </S>",
    "<S> this theoretical result hence supports the exponentially declining gas infall approximation often used in chemical evolution models . </S>",
    "<S> the infall time - scales deduced are @xmath1156  gyr , comparable to what is adopted in current chemical evolution models to solve the `` g - dwarf problem '' .    the disk of one of the two galaxies forms `` inside - out '' , the other `` outside - in '' , but in both cases the mean ages of the stars in the outskirts of the disks are @xmath1268 gyr , fairly consistent with the findings of ferguson & johnson for the disk of m31 .    </S>",
    "<S> the amount of hot gas in disk galaxy haloes is consistent with observational upper limits . </S>",
    "<S> the globular cluster m53 and the lmc are `` inserted '' in the haloes of the two milky way like disk galaxies and dispersion measures to these objects calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the results are consistent with upper limits from observed dispersion measures to pulsars in these systems .    finally , the results of the simulations indicate that the observed peak in the cosmic star formation rate at redshift @xmath13 can be reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the star formation and feedback scenarios one predicts either a cosmic star formation rate which decreases monotonically with redshift beyond these redshifts or a second peak at @xmath1@xmath1168 corresponding to the putative population iii , and interestingly similar to recent estimates of the redshift at which the universe was reionized . </S>",
    "<S> these various scenarios should hence be observationally constrainable with upcoming instruments like jwst and alma . </S>"
