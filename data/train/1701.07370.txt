    "the study of single inclusive forward jet production allows to investigate various aspects of hadron - hadron scattering .",
    "jets resulting from a hard parton interaction are boosted forward if the incoming partons have a large imbalance in the fractional hadron s momenta , @xmath0 , carried by the partons .",
    "such processes are therefore ideal to test approaches that allow for studies of both high-@xmath0 and low-@xmath0 phenomena . moreover , at large rapidity , the transverse momentum of the jet is kinematically bound to small values , making this process very sensitive to the modeling of the underlying event ( i.e. initial and final state parton showers , multi - parton interactions , and beam remnant fragmentation ) , regularization of the partonic cross section , and ( perturbative ) saturation @xcite of parton densities .    in particular this last phenomenon ,",
    "i.e. the saturation of gluons in hadrons , is one of the open problems in qcd .",
    "it is related to perturbative unitarity of the qcd evolution equations and follows from constraints on the rate of growth of the cross section as the energy of the collision increases .",
    "microscopically , saturation is an outcome of the competition between gluon splitting and gluon fusion processes , and can be theoretically described by nonlinear qcd evolution equations @xcite .",
    "phenomenological studies of various processes are compatible with the existence of saturation in nature @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss some of the open questions raised above , and we present predictions of single inclusive jet transverse momentum , energy , and feynman-@xmath0 spectra with rapidity @xmath1 in proton - proton collisions at @xmath2 and 13 tev .",
    "the chosen rapidity range corresponds to the acceptance of the castor calorimeter installed at the cms experiment @xcite , which has collected data at the lhc with pp collisions at various center - of - mass energies .",
    "the spectra are calculated using high - energy factorization ( hef ) @xcite and @xmath3-dependent parton densities . in this approach ,",
    "matrix elements for single inclusive jet production can be given at leading order as a @xmath4 process with one of the incoming partons being off - shell .",
    "this is in contrast to collinear factorization , where the matrix element for the @xmath4 process vanishes at leading order , and where one has to include corrections at higher order in @xmath5 to account for the finite transverse momentum of the jet .",
    "the results of this calculation are compared to predictions obtained with the pythia  monte carlo program @xcite , which is based on collinear factorization .",
    "in addition , the pythia  event generator also includes models for the underlying event , and the regularization of the partonic cross section .",
    "the single inclusive jet production process can be schematically written as @xmath6 where a and b are the colliding hadrons , each of which provides a parton , respectively a and b , and x corresponds to undetected , real radiation .",
    "the beam remnants from the hadrons a and b are understood to be implicitly included in the above equation .",
    "the longitudinal kinematic variables can be expressed as @xmath7 with @xmath8 the total squared energy of the colliding hadrons , while @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the rapidity and transverse momentum of the leading final state jet , respectively .",
    "the hef formula applicable for the rapidity range that we address in this paper reads @xcite : @xmath11 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : int - phi } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the unintegrated gluon density in color fundamental representation , while @xmath13 is the unintegrated gluon density in color adjoint representation .",
    "these functions depend on the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath0 and transverse momentum @xmath14 , and in general also on the hard scale @xmath15 .",
    "the matrix elements squared represent the scattering of an off - shell gluon with an on - shell quark , and an off - shell gluon with an on - shell gluon , respectively , and are averaged over initial state helicity ( indicated by the bar ) and summed over final state helicity .",
    "they can be obtained directly by application of helicity methods @xcite . for the observables that we study here ,",
    "it is known that the hard scale dependence of the unintegrated gluon density does not affect the cross section @xcite .",
    "we use unintegrated gluon densities which follow from the extended bfkl @xcite ( yielding the ks linear gluon density ) and bk ( yielding the ks nonlinear gluon density ) evolution equations @xcite .",
    "the latter gluon density includes effects from saturation due to the contribution of nonlinear terms .",
    "the formula above can be used to construct the following observables :    * transverse momentum spectrum : @xmath16 * energy spectrum : @xmath17 * feynman-@xmath0 spectrum ( @xmath18 , with @xmath19 the longitudinal momentum ) : @xmath20    partons are assumed to be massless , so that rapidity equals pseudorapidity . here , we take @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which corresponds to the acceptance of the castor calorimeter . note that for the rapidity values that are considered , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 can be approximated by @xmath25 .",
    "the pythia  monte carlo event generator ( version 8.212 ) is used to study forward jet production in the collinear factorization framework .    in a first , basic configuration ,",
    "@xmath26 qcd processes ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) above a certain threshold of exchanged transverse momentum , @xmath29 , are generated and matched with initial state radiation ( isr ) parton showers ( labeled `` hard qcd + isr '' ) , which are transverse - momentum - ordered and governed by the dglap evolution equations @xcite .",
    "other physical effects , such as final state radiation ( fsr ) and hadronization are switched off for the generation of this event sample .",
    "the partonic @xmath30 cross section for these processes diverges as @xmath31 , and would lead to an unphysical total inelastic cross section if no further regularization is applied . to illustrate this behavior , samples with a minimal transverse momentum of @xmath32 = 0.5 gev and @xmath32 = 2.0 gev are obtained , both with the minimum allowed invariant mass of the outgoing two - parton system set to zero .    a more realistic configuration of pythia  is provided by the monash tune @xcite .",
    "here , so - called soft qcd events are generated that contain a mix of semi - hard @xmath33 qcd processes in an eikonalized description , intended to be valid at all @xmath29 .",
    "an important element of this setup is the regularization of the cross section by applying a smooth dampening factor , @xmath34 , to the partonic cross section and the introduction of multiple parton interactions ( mpi ) . in order to study the influence of fsr and hadronization separately ,",
    "samples are generated with only isr ( labeled `` soft qcd + isr '' ) , with isr and fsr ( `` soft qcd + isr , fsr '' ) , and with isr , fsr , and hadronization ( `` soft qcd + isr , fsr , hadr . '' ) .    in all mc samples , jets are clustered with fastjet @xcite using the anti-@xmath35 algorithm with distance parameter equal to 0.5 @xcite .",
    "the single inclusive jet transverse momentum spectrum is shown in figure [ fig : ptspectra_hardqcd ] for center - of - mass energies @xmath2 and 13 tev .",
    "calculations with the hef framework are compared to simulations using the pythia  monte carlo event generator for `` hard qcd '' processes with only isr included .     at forward rapidity @xmath1 and for @xmath2 tev ( left ) and 13 tev ( right ) .",
    "calculations obtained with the hef framework ( labeled `` bfkl '' and `` bk '' ) are compared to simulations obtained with pythia  for hard qcd processes with isr and two different lower cutoffs on @xmath29 , the transverse momentum scale of the hard subprocess.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]   at forward rapidity @xmath1 and for @xmath2 tev ( left ) and 13 tev ( right ) .",

    "the linear ones .",
    "we attribute this effect to saturation of the unintegrated gluon density , which is indeed expected to manifest itself at low @xmath0 and @xmath14 . in the hef framework with one off - shell initial state parton , the @xmath14 of the produced jet directly corresponds to the transverse momentum of the incoming parton .",
    "when one lowers the jet @xmath14 , the sensitivity to the saturation scale becomes more visible .",
    "moreover , in a fixed rapidity window , the fractional momentum @xmath0 that is probed is also smaller for small jet @xmath14 .",
    "the region of high jet @xmath14 probes the parton densities at a scale that is much larger than the saturation scale and the predictions based on the linear ( bfkl ) and nonlinear ( bk ) evolution equations are therefore consistent , with both exhibiting a power law dependence .    the hef calculation does not include final state radiation and hadronization effects , while initial state radiation is taken into account via the @xmath14 dependence of parton densities , as an outcome of the evolution in rapidity of the unintegrated parton density .",
    "it has been argued that mpi effects are also at least partially included in hef @xcite .",
    "we therefore compare with the pythia  predictions for hard qcd @xmath30 processes with final state radiation and hadronization effects turned off .",
    "mpi processes are also not included in this configuration .",
    "the pythia  predictions are remarkably parallel to the hef calculations , and are reminiscent of the @xmath31 dependence of the partonic cross section .",
    "there exists however an important difference in normalization of the two calculations .",
    "it should be noted that the total inelastic cross section reported by pythia  is compatible with measurements only after all effects discussed below ( soft regularization , mpi , etc . )",
    "are included .",
    "we observe that introducing a lower cutoff of 2 gev on @xmath29 has a very similar effect as using the nonlinear ks gluon density .",
    "the qualitative agreement in the small and moderate transverse momentum domain of the hef prediction with pythia  is consistent with the observation already made in @xcite , and points at the consistency between the considered frameworks in re - summation of logarithms of transverse momenta when the momenta are moderate .",
    "in general one could expect that the bfkl or bk approach should provide relatively more high energy jets than the collinear framework .",
    "however , the results show that the predictions are rather comparable in shape .",
    "this is due to the inclusion of higher orders in the bfkl and bk evolution following the kms prescription @xcite : kinematic constraints and complete splitting functions that limit the phase space for energetic emissions render the result similar to collinear factorization with initial state parton showers as implemented in pythia .",
    "a more realistic description of low-@xmath10 qcd processes is available in pythia  via the generation of `` soft qcd '' collisions , including a smooth regularization of the partonic cross section and mpis .",

    "figure [ fig : ptspectra_softqcd ] also shows the effect of final state radiation and hadronization as modeled in pythia .",
    "adding fsr to the simulation results in a suppression of the high energy tail of the spectrum because energy is radiated outside the jet cone .",
    "adding hadronization effects softens the spectrum even further , which can be explained by the presence of softer particles originating from the fragmentation of partons .",

    "both the hef calculation with nonlinear evolution , and the pythia   simulations with regularization show a dramatic increase of the ratio below @xmath40 .",
    "of course , by taking the cross section ratio at a fixed value of @xmath37 , one compares the jet cross section at very different values of @xmath14 or energy for the two center - of - mass energies . for @xmath37 values below 0.3",
