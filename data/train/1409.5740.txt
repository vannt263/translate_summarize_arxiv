    "spectroscopic detection of atmospheric water vapor , oxygen , and other biosignatures will be the first step to search for exolife on exoplanets.direct imaging from space has been regarded as a promising way to find earth - like planets ( elps ) in the habitable zone ( hz).in this case , low - resolution spectroscopy ( typically of resolving power @xmath5 ) will be a means of searching for water vapor and other biosignatures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "strong molecular features including numerous water bands , the oxygen 0.76@xmath4 m band , and the ozone 10 @xmath4 m band are the targets of biosignature searches for the proposed dedicated space missions .",
    "low - resolution spectroscopy of direct imaging with extremely large telescopes ( elts ) has also been considered in the context of the search for oxygen in elps around late - type stars @xcite because the contrast of habitable planets around a m - type star is a factor of 100 greater than that around g - type stars . however , sophisticated post - processing is required to reach the typical planet - star contrast of @xmath6 from the raw contrast of @xmath7 for earth - sized planets in the hz .",
    "accurate calibrations of the time - variable nighttime airglow spectrum and the transmittance of our earth are also crucial for low - resolution spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , molecular detection with low - resolution spectroscopy requires full spectrum modeling of the planets because many thin lines are blended in the spectrum .    in principle",
    ", high - dispersion spectroscopy can solve those problems .",
    "simultaneous identification of multiple rotational - vibrational molecular lines makes detection of the molecule robust . in our solar system , @xcite first reported the detection of martian water vapor using the mount wilson 100-inch reflector in the near - infrared ( nir ) band . performing a high - dispersion observation ,",
    "they could separate the martian water lines with a doppler shift @xmath8 km / s from the telluric lines . to date",
    ", doppler - shifted water lines in hot jupiters have been detected despite the weak signal with the planet - star contrast being @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite proposed using high - dispersion transmission spectroscopy to detect the oxygen 0.76@xmath10 lines for transiting elps around nearby late - type stars .",
    "@xcite further studied its feasibility and concluded that the detection will be feasible with elts for an earth analog within 8 pc , in the most optimistic cases .",
    "as demonstrated by them , high - dispersion transmission spectroscopy is a promising means to characterize transiting elps .",
    "recent progress in radial velocity ( rv ) surveys has significantly improved their precision and a number of rv instruments have been planned for nearby planet surveys ( e.g. carmenes , crires , espresso , hpf , ird , spirou ; * ? ? ?",

    "an rv precision of @xmath11 m/s in the nir covers an earth - sized planet around nearby late - type stars .",
    "the unprecedented required precision of 10 cm / s in the visible band of espresso will reach rocky planets around solar - type stars @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of those planets in the near future , the question arises at to how we can characterize nearby habitable planet candidates to search for exolife .",
    "it is important to explore the characterization methods applicable to nontransiting elps .",
    "the first detection of doppler - shifted molecular lines for a nontransiting planet was achieved by @xcite .",
    "they performed high - dispersion slit spectroscopy of the self - luminous direct - imaged planet , beta pictorias b , and detected doppler - shifted carbon monoxide lines at the position of the planet . using adaptive optics , they could obtain contrast at the planet that was a factor of 9 - 30 greater than that in the integrated light .",
    "utilizing a combination of a high - contrast instrument and high - dispersion spectroscopy will be one of the promising ways for characterizing exoplanets ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    ", we consider high - dispersion spectroscopic detection of water vapor and oxygen in elps ( earth analog ) assuming future high - contrast and high - dispersion instruments on elts . in particular , we focus on elps around late - type stars ( @xmath12 k ) because these targets are expected to have better contrast ( @xmath6 ) than that around solar - type stars .",
    "there are several important differences between the current high - dispersion detections for hot jupiters and the method for elps we consider .",
    "first , the detection method is primarily direct imaging : the detection limit strongly depends on the performance of the high - contrast instruments , so we examine the required performance of the high - contrast instruments for molecular detection .",
    "second , the light from the elp we consider is scattered light , not emission light .",
    "this fact implies that stellar lines can contaminate the planet spectrum .",
    "intrinsic water lines in the stellar spectra of late - type stars can cause false positives , while stellar intrinsic lines in the scattered lines can also be regarded as the signal of the planet , as pointed by @xcite .",
    "third , telluric contamination is different from the case of hot jupiters because the elt signal + speckle system is much fainter than the hot jupiter + star system .",
    "the nighttime airglow effect should be considered . moreover ,",
    "the suitable band to observe is different : the nir band will be assumed for water and oxygen detection because it is the most suitable for wavefront correction by the extreme ao ( exao ) , whereas the current water detection of hot jupiters uses a longer wavelength ( l band ) . to investigate the feasibility of the method including these effects",
    ", we perform detailed simulations using the radiative transfer of the earth .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we provide the definitions of the doppler - shifted water , oxygen , and scattered stellar lines and describe the statistics for a given planetary system and instrumental and observational conditions . in section 3 , the spectra at the planet position are created by including the planetary scattered spectrum simulated by the radiative transfer code , the stellar speckle , the nighttime airglow , and the transmittance of our earth .",
    "a cross - correlation analysis of the mock spectra and the spectral templates of the molecular lines is performed to study the feasibility . in section 4",
    ", we show the results of the cross - correlation analysis for water , oxygen , carbon dioxide , and stellar intrinsic lines scattered by a planet .",
    "we also investigate the sensitivity of the results to the systematics . in section 5 ,",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "in this section , we explain what type of observation we assume and show how this method works using orders - of - magnitude arguments .",
    "we consider high - dispersion spectroscopy of elps after speckle suppression .",
    "the planetary signals are spectroscopically separated from the stellar speckle and the telluric lines .",
    "the spectral range is restricted to y , j , and h bands because of the balance of the inner working angle and ease of wavefront control .",
    "we assume an observing campaign of one planet with a long exposure time (  10 days ) because the rv or other planet surveys will have detected the target planet in the hz in the near future .",
    "we also assume that the aperture extracted for the spectrum analysis is fixed at the planet position .",
    "if the planet can be detected by direct imaging with post - processing , as a result , the position angle of the planet is known , and one can perform slit spectroscopy or fiber spectroscopy at the planet position . if we do not utilize direct - imaging detection , we require integral field spectroscopy with high spectral resolution because we only know the angular separation of the planet and the host star in this case",
    ". however , we will not consider the detector type any further and concentrate on the signals at the planetary position .      to separate the planetary signals",
    ", we utilize the relative velocities of the star , the planet , and the observer frame .",
    "the origins of the molecular lines in the integrated spectrum are characterized by the relative velocity as shown in table [ tab : lines ] .",
    "doppler - shifted molecular lines originating from the planetary atmosphere ( planetary lines ) have a relative velocity that is the sum of the velocity owing to the orbital motion of the planet , @xmath13 and the peculiar velocity of the system , @xmath14 , with respect to the observer ( the relative velocity between the star and the sun and the orbital and spin motion of the earth ) .",
    "the lines originating from the stellar spectrum are imprinted in the integrated spectrum in two ways with different doppler velocities .",
    "one is imprinted in the planetary spectrum because the scattered light of the planet is originally star light .",
    "those lines are regarded as the planetary signals as well as the planetary lines with the peculiar velocity @xmath15 .",
    "we refer to those lines as scattered stellar lines .",
    "the other is simply from the speckle , i.e. , contamination of the central starlight ( speckle stellar lines ) , which has the peculiar velocity of the system , @xmath16 .",
    "hence this velocity difference between the direct star light and the scattered star light is .",
    "scattered stellar lines have been proposed as a tracer of scattered light from exoplanets by @xcite . finally ,",
    "telluric water vapor , oxygen , and other species contribute numerous absorption lines to the spectrum and oh and @xmath17 emit peculiar lines , i.e. , the nighttime airglow .",
    "those lines have the velocity of the observer frame , i.e. , @xmath18 in our definition .",
    "we refer to those lines as telluric lines .",
    "the radial velocity resulting from planetary orbital motion is expressed as @xmath19 for a circular orbit , where @xmath20 indicates the orbital velocity of the planet , @xmath21 is the orbital inclination , and @xmath22 is the orbital angular velocity .",
    "the typical orbital velocity at the hz @xcite around main sequence stars is 20 - 50 km / s for stellar masses of @xmath23 .",
    "the orbital velocity at the hz generally increases as the stellar mass decreases .",
    "hence , high resolution spectroscopy with @xmath24 can distinguish the velocity difference @xmath13 unless the system is almost face - on ( @xmath25 ) .",

    "because the nighttime airglow is the largest source of background photons and is comparable to the planet flux ( see their figure 7 ) based on their assumptions , the calibration of the time - variable telluric oxygen emission is crucial .",
    "furthermore , they require an increase in the contrast on the order of @xmath124 by post - processing .",
    "the method presented in this paper requires a long exposure time , however , the photon counts of the nighttime airglow are negligible because we have speckles that are a factor of hundreds to thousands larger than the planet flux .",
    "the raw contrast @xmath1 is sufficient for the method with no sophisticated post - processing .",
    "hence , detection with doppler - shifted oxygen lines is more robust than that with low - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "the 1.6 @xmath4 m band produced by @xmath28 ( denoted by cd1.6 in figure [ fig : mixspectra ] ) is the third strongest molecular absorption of the earth in this band .",
    "we also perfrom a ccf analysis for @xmath28 using the exoponential model .",
    "we adopt that @xmath125 because the carbon dioxide column density is @xmath9010 times smaller than the water column density .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : ox ] , the @xmath28 signal is weaker than those of water and oxygen and is barely detectable ( 2 @xmath2 detection ) if we assume @xmath42 for the case of @xmath86 k.      for the extraction of scattered stellar lines , the stellar spectrum itself is used as the template @xmath126 .",
    "this template naturally includes the velocity of the system , @xmath16 .",
    "hence , one find the ccf signal at @xmath127 because of the relative velocity of the star and the planet . for the stellar scattered line , the rotational broadening resulting from the stellar spin is crucial .",
    "the projected rotational velocity of hundreds of nearby m dwarfs has been determined observationally . @xcite and @xcite provided a distribution of @xmath128 for m0-m4.5 and m4-l6 , respectively . whereas most m0-m3 stars ( corresponding to @xmath129 k ) have @xmath130 10 km / s , m3.5-m6.5 ( @xmath131 k ) stars exhibit a wide range of @xmath128 , typically 0 - 30 km / s .",
    "based on these results , we consider four stellar rotational velocity , @xmath132 and 20 km / s .    in this simulation ,",
    "we find that the ccf exhibits a clear feature of the scattered stellar lines at @xmath133 as expected ( figure [ fig : fs ] ) .",
    "because we assume @xmath71 , the difference in the width of the ccf signal between @xmath103 km / s and 5 km / s can not be resolved . for @xmath13410 or 20 km",
    "/ s , the signal width roughly corresponds to @xmath135 10 or 20 km / s because of the convolution of the widths of the template and the data .",
    "this broadening effect weakens the ccf signal .",
    "hence a slow rotator is more suitable as a target .",
    "although scattered stellar lines do not have the information on the planetary atmosphere , their detection will be direct evidence of scattered light from the planet .",
    "scattered stellar lines also have the advantage that the signal does not directly depend on the atmospheric composition of the planet .",
    "given the blind search for planets , this virtue is notable .     and 20 km / s .",
    "we assume @xmath42 and use 0.95 - 1.8 @xmath4 m. [ fig : fs ] ]",
    "as examined in the previous section , the method needs a long exposure to detect the signal .",
    "what are the advantages of this method compared to the low - resolution spectroscopy by direct imaging from the ground ?",
    "one is that the method requires no additional post - processing to improve the contrast from the raw contrast by exao + coronagraph ; in other words , this method is the post - processing itself .",
    "this feature is helpful because , for low - resolution spectroscopy of elps from the ground , post - processing must be used to improve the final planet - star contrast level to @xmath136 from the raw contrast level .",
    "as far as we know , there has yet to be a full simulation that presents evidence that the exao + coronagraph with post processing improves the contrast by more than @xmath137 from the raw contrast ( given @xmath138 and @xmath139 used in our simulations ) .",
    "another point is the simpleness of the calibrations , as discussed in  4.2 and 4.3 .",
    "low - resolution spectroscopy requires very careful calibrations of the nighttime airglow and the transmittance of our earth because those are directly related to the estimate of the depth of the absorption feature for the low - resolution case @xcite .",
    "hence , even after post - processing reaches the planet - star contrast of elps , the method is complementary and will make molecular detection robust .",
    "so far we have used a wide range of wavelength 0.95 - 1.8 @xmath4 m . from the standpoint of instrumental development , one might start from a narrower range . in the previous section",
    ", we showed that the j band has the strongest water signal within 0.95 - 1.8 @xmath4 m ( figure [ fig : color ] ) .",
    "the j band also has the oxygen 1.27 @xmath4 m band in it .",
    "we also note that the performance of the exao will be higher around the j and h bands owing to the wavelength dependence of the wavefront error . in our simulation ,",
    "the ccfs using the j band exhibited 3 and 12 @xmath2 water detections for @xmath89 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "for these reasons , we suggest the j band as the most fruitful band for this method .    in this paper , we assumed a long exposure ( 10 days ) for characterization of the elp .",
    "hence , the method might not be suitable for a survey .",
    "the point we should consider is how we choose the adequate candidates for a long observing campaign .",
    "direct imaging using elts is one promising way to find targets . assuming the use of elts and the piaacmc coronagraph , @xcite presented technological solutions to observing rocky planets around nearby m dwarfs . presented the detectability of planets by assuming an exao on an elt and contrast improvement by post - processing . utilizing frequencies of low mass planets from the kepler mission",
    ", he found that @xmath90 10 planets with @xmath140 with radiative equilibrium temperature @xmath141 k can be accessible with elts .",
    "those planets will be excellent targets for the method presented here .",
    "if the planet is detected by using both radial velocity and astrometry , a long observation at the planet position predicted by those detection methods is possible without direct imaging .",
    "however , when only the radial velocity is available , the method becomes more challenging .",
    "for this case , we have no information on the position angle . to apply the method to those planets , integral field spectroscopy with @xmath142",
    "is required .",
    "the detection of water lines does not mean the presence of surface liquid water . regarding the search for liquid water",
    ", the diagnosis proposed by @xcite is a promising option .",
    "they suggested the difference in the diurnal variability of water vapor and oxygen lines as evidence for the existence of surface liquid water . in this paper , we did not include the surface inhomogeneity in our simulations and we might require information on the rotation period to stack the signal to extract the variability .",
    "more detailed simulations are required to explore the possibility of further characterization of elp with the combination of the high - dispersion and high - contrast instruments .    in summary",
    ", we investigated a method to characterize both nontransiting and transiting elps via the doppler - shifted water vapor and oxygen lines using high - dispersion spectroscopy and high - contrast instruments on elts .",
    "this method requires no additional post - processing from the raw contrast . performing mock observations using the radiative transfer code for the earth , we examined the feasibility of the method with elts .",
    "a long observing campaign with a total exposure of 10 days can detect the water vapor lines on nearby elps around m - type stars if the high contrast instruments suppress the speckle to the level of @xmath7 at 15 mas . if the raw contrast reaches @xmath1 , the oxygen 1.27 @xmath4 m feature is also detectable . for an elp around solar - type stars ,",
    "one need a contrast that is a factor of several hundreds greater at @xmath90 100 mas .",
    "a combination of high - dispersion and high - contrast instruments on elts will enable us to characterize nearby exoplanets even for earth - sized planets within the hz .",
