    "<S> the recent measurements by cleo for the inclusive @xmath0 and @xmath1 production in @xmath2 decay and our previous calculation are analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 momentum spectrum and the production ratio of @xmath4 versus @xmath3 favour @xmath5 as the dominant contribution . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that the differences between the experimental data and our previous results are mainly originated from the setting of the parameter charm quark mass . encouraged by this result </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the associate strange particle enhancement as a probe for the open charm particles in @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> besides the important rle in the electroweak and cp violation research , heavy quark ( b or c ) physics is also the traditional arena for quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , both in perturbative ( p ) and non - perturbative ( np ) aspects . </S>",
    "<S> the production and annihilation of heavy quarks via strong interactions can be calculated by pqcd for their large masses naturally set the hard scales , while the structures of heavy hadrons are ruled by npqcd . since heavy quarks can hardly be produced in npqcd phase , one can compare the quantities of them calculated by pqcd with those of the corresponding heavy hadrons to study the npqcd effects . </S>",
    "<S> hence , heavy quarks act as bridges linking the p and np phases of qcd . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , such a distinct character requires a careful investigation on both pqcd and npqcd phases for a certain process , as one has to do in the study of quarkonium production .    </S>",
    "<S> non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite provides a factorization framework @xcite to calculate the heavy quarkonium production and decay . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the inclusive production of charmonium @xmath6 in the @xmath7 collision can be written as @xmath8 which is a sum of various contributions . </S>",
    "<S> each contribution is the product of two factors : one is the cross section of the quark pair production in a definite ( colour , angular momentum , etc . ) state , the other is the nrqcd matrix elements to describe the transition probability of the quark pair to the relevant quarkonium . </S>",
    "<S> this formula clearly implies that one has to take into account all the competing contributions in calculating the cross section measured by experiments . for the inclusive charmonia production in @xmath9 interaction at tevatron @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the colour - octet process @xcite seems necessary to explain the total cross sections as well as the transverse momentum spectra ( but it is not clear yet why the polarization of @xmath10 not properly described @xcite ) , because only the cross section of all the colour - singlet processes summed up is of one order lower than the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> this is one example that teaches us to include all kinds of contributions , but does not mean colour - octet process(es ) always the dominant . until now , the values of colour - octet matrix elements can only be extracted via fitting the data but are generally believed to be smaller than the colour - singlet ones , based upon the nrqcd velocity counting rule . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , when the same matrix elements determined at cdf are applied to photoproduction of @xmath3 at hera , the color - octet contribution is about a factor of ten too large @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that these matrix elements may be even smaller . </S>",
    "<S> so , for a concrete process , one can not judge  priori which kind of process is the main contribution and can not truncate the hard part ( @xmath11 in equation ( [ nrqcdfac ] ) ) to a certain order of @xmath12 , without distinction for colour - singlet or colour - octet partonic processes . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the suppression from @xmath12 for higher order colour - singlet partonic process(es ) can be compensated by the larger colour - singlet matrix element(s ) ( the colour - singlet matrix elements of vector mesons can be determined unambiguously from their leptonic decays ) . </S>",
    "<S> so higher order ( in @xmath12 ) colour - singlet process could also contribute significantly . </S>",
    "<S> this is the key point @xcite to understand the inclusive @xmath3 production data in @xmath13 decay @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the strong decay of @xmath13 is dominantly via 3 gluons , because of charge parity conservation . </S>",
    "<S> so the straightforward partonic process for the charmonium production is @xmath14 @xcite , which is of lowest order pqcd to create charm quark pair . here </S>",
    "<S> the charm quark pair is produced via the virtual gluon splitting and is inherently colour - octet . </S>",
    "<S> when the colour - octet matrix element extracted from tevatron is applied , one can get the branching ratio comparable to the experimental data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , because one of the real gluon is preferred to be soft , the @xmath3 momentum spectrum peaks at the maximum value , like a 2-body final state configuration . </S>",
    "<S> this was not consistent with the old cleo measurements @xcite , but the error bar was too large to draw a final conclusion , then . </S>",
    "<S> another colour - octet process which is also of the 2-body final state configuration was suggested @xcite , ignorant of the @xmath3 momentum spectrum , too . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the cleo collaboration make a new measurement for the @xmath2 decays to charmonium final state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the data sample is 35 times larger . </S>",
    "<S> the more precise measurement confirm a rather soft spectrum of the @xmath3 in the @xmath15 process , which is consistent with the colour - singlet process prediction @xcite both in the branching ratio as well as the @xmath3 spectrum but clearly conflict with the colour - octet processes in @xmath3 momentum spectrum .    as is discussed in @xcite and in above , because the much larger colour - singlet matrix element(s ) can compensate the suppression from powers of @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> , one should not ignore the colour - singlet process(es ) if the suppression from powers of @xmath12 is not too large ( e.g. here , only one extra @xmath12 ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence we calculated the contribution of @xmath16 to the inclusive @xmath3 production of @xmath13 decay @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is dominant of colour - singlet process and can be treated within the traditional non - relativistic wave function approach @xcite . for this process </S>",
    "<S> , it is very clear that the more final state particles , especially the open charm hadrons from the unbound charm quark pair make the @xmath3 spectrum much more soft . </S>",
    "<S> that the dominant contribution of this channel is via colour - singlet process requires that the bound @xmath17 and @xmath18 should come from different virtual gluons and in nearly the same momentum . </S>",
    "<S> this configuration in phase space eliminates the 2-body like configuration that the real gluon is soft and the 2 virtual gluon splitting into 2 back to back @xmath19 pair with minimum invariant mass . </S>",
    "<S> so the momentum spectrum of @xmath3 can not peak at the largest value . </S>",
    "<S> though the qualitative analysis is perfectly consistent with data , the new data @xcite and our calculation @xcite does not coincide completely . </S>",
    "<S> one may be interested whether there are other dynamical reasons ignored . </S>",
    "<S> hence in the following , we first clarify that the `` inconsistency '' between the data and our calculation comes from the setting of the parameter charm mass in numerical calculation . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize on the @xmath3 momentum spectrum and the production ratio of @xmath4 versus @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we investigate the associate strange particle enhancement as a way to probe the charm quark accompanying with @xmath3 .       _ </S>",
    "<S> the reason for the `` harder '' spectrum of our previous calculation than that of the experiment _    the cleo collaboration claims that the momentum spectrum is `` closer to , although softer than '' our colour - singlet prediction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is just because we did not take into account the open charm threshold effect in the partonic level calculation . in our calculation </S>",
    "<S> , we let the charm quark mass equals to half of @xmath3 mass . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the unphysical region when the @xmath20 cluster mass smaller than @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> if taking into account the threshold effect , the peak in our calculation should move to the left about @xmath22 unit of @xmath23 ( scaled momentum ) . </S>",
    "<S> this means the position of the peak of our calculated @xmath3 momentum spectrum ( see , fig . 3 of @xcite or fig . </S>",
    "<S> 10 of @xcite ) should move to around @xmath24 rather than @xmath25 . considering that </S>",
    "<S> the width of the bins of the experimental data is 0.2 unit , the prediction of the colour - singlet model is consistent rather than softer than the data .       _ </S>",
    "<S> the `` wrong '' result of our calculation of @xmath4 production rate _    </S>",
    "<S> if we only consider the production rate of @xmath4 itself , it may be natural to choose @xmath26 and use the @xmath27 decay width to extract the wave function ( in fact sometimes one needs to tune the quark mass to get the proper absolute value of the cross section ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is what we did in our previous calculation . in @xcite , when calculating the partonic cross section of charm pair creation for @xmath3 production , we use @xmath28 ; while calculating that for the @xmath1 production , we use @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen from the table demonstrating the charm mass dependence , this leads to a difference of about 2.5 times . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the wave functions square and the branching ratio of @xmath1 to @xmath3 lead to another factor about 4 . </S>",
    "<S> this is why in our paper we only predicted about 10 per cent of @xmath3 are from the decay of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> however , if we calculate the production ratio(es ) between @xmath3 , @xmath4 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> , and adopt that they are different eigenstates of @xmath30 bound state , their differences should be only inherent in the wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath31 is explained as originated from difference of binding energies . </S>",
    "<S> hence the charm quark mass should be taken as the same . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the calculated results consistent and simple for the colour - singlet processes . in the framework of non - relativistic wave function approach @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , one can easily derive , for the s - wave particles , @xmath32 in the above equations , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are wave functions at origin for @xmath4 and @xmath3 , respectively . to get the relations in equation ( [ nwf ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we notice that @xmath35 should be , to order @xmath36 , @xmath37 where @xmath38 represents other integral variables than the @xmath39 energy @xmath40 for the @xmath41 phase space element . </S>",
    "<S> p is the four momentum of @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath42 is the invariant amplitude for @xmath43 process . in this formula , </S>",
    "<S> when taking the same charm quark mass , the only difference for different s - wave bound states is the wave function square . for the leptonic decay width of s - wave vector charmonia </S>",
    "<S> , a very similar formula and hence conclusion can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> only that one should take the energy of the charmonia at rest frame to be @xmath44 , neglecting their mass differences .    </S>",
    "<S> using the values of 2002 data book @xcite , which is also used by the experimental group @xcite , one can calculate the ratio of the @xmath45 decay widths ( central value ) between @xmath4 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it is striking to be 0.416 ( the to - date values give 0.45 ) , which is very near the central value of the data 0.41 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the colour - octet process can not simply derive such a relation with the @xmath45 decay width and @xmath3 @xcite is around 0.3 , which is lower than but within the error of the data . ]    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , we have not got the analytical formula for the partonic process </S>",
    "<S> @xmath46 , so it is difficult to evaluate the p wave particles which is also measured by cleo . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation needs the derivatives of the partonic amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> encouraged from the s - wave productions , we leave the calculation of p - wave particles as an interesting separate work to do .    from the above discussions , it is clear not that nrqcd leads to the prediction that the colour - octet processes dominate in @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> it is just the nrqcd formulae require a global consideration of all possible partonic processes to explain the data . </S>",
    "<S> frankly , there are many uncertain parameters like quark mass , @xmath12 ( scale dependence is significant in the lowest order calculation ) , etc . </S>",
    "<S> so only quantities like the relative production ratio and shape of spectrum which are not sensitive to the absolute values of these parameters are relevant to justify the partonic processes . only to get a cross section or branching ratio comparable with data sometimes seems tricky .       </S>",
    "<S> _ associate strange particle enhancement _ the above arguments confirm the significance of the colour - singlet process . as has been pointed out by @xcite and </S>",
    "<S> the experimental group @xcite , a very important probe for the partonic process is to measure the content of the cluster produced associated with the @xmath3 in the @xmath13 decay , which is theoretical - framework - independent . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to notice that in @xmath45 continuum process at nearly the same energy , belle collaboration @xcite reported that about 60 per cent events of @xmath47 is from @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a challenge for the theory , and also suggests the importance to measure the associate particles in @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the data sample seems still not enough . according to the experiment @xcite , the @xmath45 and @xmath49 pairs </S>",
    "<S> are used to identify and reconstruct the charmonium . </S>",
    "<S> only less than @xmath50 @xmath3 events are collected . </S>",
    "<S> even if these events are all @xmath51 , and employing the standard method to reconstruct all the charm pseudo - scalar and vector mesons that the associate charm quarks fragment to one can only expect to get less than 10 per cent events . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> it is not efficient to reconstruct all the important charm mesons . </S>",
    "<S> if only use the @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) channel , the number of events to be found could only be around 9 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then the statistical error may not allow a definite conclusion .    </S>",
    "<S> however , a charm quark generally decays into strange quark , hence the strange particles can manifest the ever - production of charm . </S>",
    "<S> so the inclusive measurement of kaon may be a good probe @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> besides charm decay , the strange quark can be created from the vacuum during the hadronization process . </S>",
    "<S> hence it is not the absolute production rate of strange particles but their enhancement relative to other cases is the very signal for charm . for the processes we are going to investigate , </S>",
    "<S> the colour - octet models predict a flavour - singlet cluster ( one or two colour - octet gluon(s ) ) associate with @xmath3 , while the colour - singlet model predicts the cluster @xmath54 , which lead to strange flavour via weak decay . to find a measurable quantity , we study the ratio @xmath55 ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 are average multiplicity of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively ) of the cluster accompanying with the @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster @xmath54 is colour - singlet and we can straightforwardly employ jetset @xcite to simulate its hadronization . to @xmath60 , with the weight calculated by the same programme to calculate the @xmath3 spectrum . ] </S>",
    "<S> we can expect the ratio is similar as those of @xmath61 at the same energy ( see table 1 ) . on the other hand , it is not very practical to hadronize the * colour - octet * 2-gluon - cluster with jetset for the colour - octet process @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> another `` technical '' problem is that in the partonic level calculation , this cluster dominantly have a vanishing invariant mass . for providing a reference to the charm enhancement </S>",
    "<S> , we give the result of a cluster of @xmath63 which is in colour - singlet ( its invariant mass is set to be the peak value of the @xmath20 cluster mass ) . </S>",
    "<S> what is in common for the 2-gluon cluster in colour - octet and colour - singlet is that they are both flavour - singlet . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the @xmath55 value is not sensitive to the invariant mass for the colour - singlet @xmath63 cluster . at the same time , using the jetset subroutine ( lu1ent ) , one can investigate the `` independent '' fragmentation of one gluon in the colour - octet process @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained @xmath55 is insensitive to its energy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the result is near that of colour - singlet @xmath63 cluster ( table 1 ) . for 2-gluon system , </S>",
    "<S> if we do not care it is in colour - singlet or octet , its @xmath55 value can be obtained from independent fragmentation of each gluon , which is very near that of the colour - singlet 2-gluon cluster from the above discussion . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the colour - octet 2-gluon cluster should give @xmath55 not far beyond that of the colour - singlet cluster . </S>",
    "<S> besides the above , for a comprehensive comparison , the results of a flavour - singlet virtual photon ( @xmath65 ) are also given as reference , but we should understand that the electromagnetic interaction breaks the flavour su(4 ) invariance ( the initial quark effects ) . </S>",
    "<S> the result is also shown in table 1 .    in table 1 , we give the `` errors '' of the calculated results . their definition is based upon the following consideration : the number of collected events by the cleo collaboration is only of the order @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> so we should estimate the statistical error , or the fluctuation of some @xmath50 event samples . </S>",
    "<S> here we use @xmath66 to represent the `` real '' value of @xmath55 , which can be estimated by a sample generated by jetset with event number large enough ( @xmath67 ) . at the same time , we generate many @xmath50 event samples , then we calculate @xmath68 the subscript j represents each @xmath50 event sample . in table 1 , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath55 values are given in the form @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> for the processes we discuss above . </S>",
    "<S> we can conclude that the fluctuations are small and will not smear the difference , so that the strange particle enhancement of the @xmath20 cluster is very significant , comparing with the flavour - singlet g ( gg ) as well as the virtual photon .    </S>",
    "<S> .the production ratio between @xmath70 and @xmath71 in various processes . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in summary , we point out that the recent measurements for @xmath13 decay into charmonium final states by cleo collaboration agree well with the @xmath72 calculation , provided that the value of charm quark mass is properly set . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the colour - singlet process could be the dominant for the inclusive @xmath3 or @xmath1 production in @xmath13 decay . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by investigating the hadronization of the parton(s ) produced accompanying with the @xmath3 in @xmath13 decay , we found that the @xmath20 cluster in colour - singlet ( but not flavour - singlet ) will lead to significant strange particle enhancement comparing to the colour - octet ( but flavour - singlet ) gluon(s ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is a good signal to probe the process @xmath73 .       </S>",
