    "over the past few decades , a considerable number of studies have been performed on 3@xmath1 transition - metal oxides which have a considerably narrow 3@xmath1 band . in particular , a metal - to - insulator transition caused by a strong electron correlation@xcite ( mott transition ) as well as anomalous electronic properties in the metallic phase near the mott transition have attracted the interest of many researchers . since the discovery of the high-@xmath2 cuprate superconductors , the importance of two types of experimental approaches to the mott transition",
    "have been discussed intensively :   a filling control and a band - width control .",
    "the former consists in doping holes or electrons to the system , and the latter in varying the strength of the electron correlation @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the electron correlation due to coulomb repulsion and @xmath5 is the one - electron band - width .    in recent years , the systematic evolutions of optical conductivity spectra in going from a correlated metallic phase to the mott - hubbard insulating phase have been reported on both the filling controlled and the band - width controlled mott - hubbard systems.@xcite the smallest energy gap for charge excitations of the mott - hubbard insulator is the excitation energy of the charge fluctuation @xmath6 , so - called a mott - hubbard gap.@xcite the optical conductivity of the mott - hubbard insulator is considered to show a gap feature due to the above charge excitation from the lower hubbard band to the upper hubbard band .",
    "v@xmath7o@xmath8 and related compounds have been extensively studied as typical materials which show the mott transition with varying the strength of the @xmath3 ratio .",
    "the temperature dependent optical conductivity of v@xmath7o@xmath8 was reported by thomas _",
    "et al_.  through the metal - to - insulator transition.@xcite the optical conductivity of v@xmath7o@xmath8 in the insulating phase shows a gap feature , which is attributed to the mott - hubbard gap excitation . on the other hand , in the metallic state , a low - energy contribution to",
    "the optical conductivity shows an anomalous feature , which is reproduced by two lorentzians .",
    "moreover , the optical conductivity shows an anomalous enhancement of the spectral weight as a function of temperature .",
    "et al_.  reported that these experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction obtained by the infinite - dimension hubbard model within the mean - field approach.@xcite since the formation of the mott - hubbard bands are predicted even in the metallic state for this kind of strongly correlated system , the optical conductivity spectra should be affected by the precursor features.@xcite it is very interesting to see how the spectral weight varies with the electron correlation in the correlated metallic state near the mott transition .",
    "for a detailed discussion , however , we need to control the strength of the electron correlation more precisely .",
    "the perovskite - type early 3@xmath1 transition - metal oxides are ideal mott - hubbard systems for controlling the band filling and band - width by chemical substitutions .",

    "a similar change was also observed on an alloy system , la@xmath9y@xmath10tio@xmath8.@xcite these systematic variations of the optical conductivity are interpreted as the successive increase of the mott - hubbard gap with the increase of the strength of the @xmath3 ratio . in these materials",
    ", however the system remains an insulator even for the least correlated latio@xmath8 , therefore one can not study the evolution of the metallic properties under the band - width control in this system .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify the evolution of the optical conductivity spectrum in the metallic phase near the mott transition , as we control the strength of the electron correlation @xmath3 without changing the band filling .",
    "a perovskite - type @xmath14 vanadate  is considered to be a strongly correlated metal close to the mott transition.@xcite we can control the strength of the @xmath3 ratio , by chemical substitution of a sr ion for a ca ion of the same valence without varying the nominal @xmath15-electron number per vanadium ion.@xcite we report the optical conductivity spectra in this strongly correlated alloy system .",

    "the samples were excited by the 514.5  nm ar ion laser line .",
    "polarization of the incident light was taken to be parallel to that of the scattered light .",
    "optical reflectivity measurements were carried out at room temperature ( @xmath18300  k ) in the energy range between 0.05  ev and 40  ev using a michelson - type fourier - transform infrared spectrometer ( 0.050.6  ev ) , a grating monochrometer ( 0.55.6  ev ) , and a seya - namioka - type grating for the synchrotron radiation ( 540  ev ) at the beamline bl-11d of photon factory , tsukuba . the surfaces of the samples were mechanically polished with diamond paste for the optical measurements .",
    "the absolute reflectivity was determined by referring to the reflectivity of an al or ag film which was measured at same optical alignment .",

    "since the k - k analysis requires @xmath20 for @xmath24 , two assumptions must be made to extrapolate the observed data beyond the upper and lower bounds of the measurements . in the present study ,",
    "the reflectivity data were first extrapolated from the lowest measured energy down to @xmath13 with the hagen - rubens formula which is an approximation for @xmath20 of conventional metals .",
    "then , beyond the highest measured energy , the reflectivity data were extrapolated up to @xmath25 with an asymptotic function of @xmath26 .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction measurements were carried out to characterize the samples and to determine the lattice constants . in fig .",

    "however , we assumed the crystal structure of all samples ( @xmath30 ) orthorhombic and deduced the lattice constants .",
    "the lattice constants increase monotonously with the increase of @xmath16 , ensuring the appropriate formation of the solid solution over the whole composition range .",
    "raman scattering measurements give indirect information about the crystal symmetry , because the appearance of some raman - active phonon lines depends crucially on the crystal symmetry of the system . in fig .",
    "[ f.raman ] , we show the raman spectra of   at room temperature in the wave - number range of 80400@xmath31 .    in this wave - number range , four raman active @xmath32 phonon lines are observed in orthorhombic  ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the energies of the phonon lines shift to the lower energy side , and the width of the peaks become broader , as we increase the sr content @xmath16 .",
    "the raman active phonon lines disappear completely in .    according to the group theory analysis,@xcite",
    "it is predicted that several raman active phonon modes @xmath34 can exist in the orthorhombically distorted perovskite which belongs to the point group symmetry of @xmath35 . on the other hand ,",
    "the cubic perovskite which belongs to the point group symmetry of @xmath36 is `` raman forbidden '' , namely it has no raman - active phonon modes .",
    "therefore , the experimental results tell us that the crystal symmetry actually changes from the orthorhombic distorted perovskite ( ) to the cubic perovskite ( ) . the orthorhombic to cubic transition is considered to occur between @xmath37 and 0.75 .",
    "as discussed in the preceding paper,@xcite the orthorhombic distortion implies that the v  o  v bond angle is deviated from 180@xmath38 , _",
    "i.e. _ , there is an alternately tilting network of the vo@xmath39 octahedra .",
    "the v  o  v bond angle of  is 180@xmath17 same as an ideal perovskite structure , while that of  is @xmath18160@xmath17 .",
    "the bond angle deviation from 180@xmath38 reduces the overlap between the neighboring v  3@xmath1 orbital mediated by the o  2@xmath40 orbital .",
    "therefore , the one - electron band - width @xmath5 of v 3@xmath1 band decreases with decreasing the v  o  v bond angle .",
    "accordingly , we can control the value of @xmath5 by chemical substitution of the ca@xmath41 ion for the sr@xmath41 ion of the same valence without varying the nominal @xmath15-electron number per vanadium ion . since the electron correlation energy @xmath4 are almost the same in  and , we can thus control the strength of the @xmath3 ratio by the chemical substitution .",

    "all the samples exhibit high reflectivity from far - infrared to near - infrared region , and we can recognize a sharp reflectivity edge appearing at @xmath181.3  ev .",
    "since  is metallic over the whole composition range , the optical reflectivity is dominated by the signal of conduction electrons in this photon energy region .",
    "systematic spectral changes with @xmath16 are observed in the energy range of the ultra - violet and vacuum - ultra - violet light .",
    "the changes are partly due to the differences in the conduction bands of the ca@xmath41 and sr@xmath41 cations . but",
    "this is irrelevant for the discussion of the main subject .",

    "et al_.  have found a prominent peak at 2.5@xmath183  ev above @xmath89 and a shoulder within around 1  ev of @xmath89.@xcite these features have been also assigned to the incoherent and coherent parts of the spectral function of the v  3@xmath1 electron .",
    "these results lead us into consideration that the two features ( the peak `` a '' and `` b '' ) observed in the optical conductivity spectra should originate in possible combinations of the transitions among the incoherent and coherent features of v  3@xmath1 electron around the fermi level .",
    "the experimental results of the optical conductivity can be compared to the theoretical prediction obtained by the self - consistent local - impurity approximation of the infinite - dimension hubbard model.@xcite the theory seems to give us a clue to understand the origin of the two features : the peak `` a '' and the peak `` b '' . according to the prediction , the optical response is composed of basically three contributions except the drude part :   a broad part centered at a frequency @xmath107 , a few narrow features near @xmath108 , and an `` anomalous '' part that is present in the range @xmath13 to 1  ev approximately .",
    "the contribution at @xmath4 corresponds to direct excitations between the hubbard bands , the features at @xmath109 corresponds to excitations from the lhb to the empty part of the quasiparticle band and from the filled part of the quasiparticle band to the uhb , and finally , the `` anomalous '' part corresponds to excitations from the filled to the empty part of the quasiparticle band . in our previous paper,@xcite",
    "we analyzed the spectrum of  in the light of these predictions .",
    "the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which were used in the model calculation , were taken from the results of photoemission spectroscopy@xcite . although it was expected that the parameter @xmath5 would systematically change with composition ,",
    "we chose to vary @xmath4 for the sake of simplicity , given that fits of equivalent quality could be obtained for the photoemission spectra . in , which has the narrowest 3@xmath1 band in the  system , the peaks `` a '' and `` b '' have been well described by the features at @xmath109 and @xmath4 , respectively , so that the infinite - dimension hubbard model seems to reproduce the experimentally obtained optical conductivity reasonably well.@xcite    we find that our new experimental results as summarized in fig .",
    "[ f.abshift ] :   with the increase of @xmath16 , the peak energy of the peak `` b '' shifts slightly to lower energy side and its spectral weight gradually increases .",
    "the spectral weight of the peak `` a '' increases with @xmath16 .",
    "the peak `` a '' , however , shifts slightly to higher energy .",
    "we shall now like to emphasize an important point .",
    "our present systematic study of the  compound gives conclusive evidence that we can tune the band - width of the system by controlling @xmath16 .",
    "the position of the peak `` b '' gives a direct measure of the value of @xmath4 , and the fact that it remains almost a constant is a clear evidence that the ratio @xmath3 is controlled by a change of the band - width @xmath5 .",
    "this situation is in sharp contrast with our previous analysis@xcite based on photoemission data which did not allow us to resolve which parameter was actually controlling the @xmath3 ratio .",
    "a crucial ingredient that makes the study of the optical response so valuable for this analysis is that , unlike photoemission , it probes also the unoccupied part of the spectra , therefore , it is sensitive to the relative position of the hubbard bands .    in order to gain some further insight in the qualitative behavior of the systematic evolution of our experimental data ,",
    "we have used our initial estimates for @xmath4 and @xmath5 as input parameters in a calculation of the optical response of the hubbard model and changed the value of @xmath5 instead of @xmath4 .",
    "we shall consider the model within the dynamical mean field theory which becomes exact in the limit of large lattice connectivity ( or large dimensionality ) .",
    "for convenience we have computed the optical response using the iterated perturbation theory ( ipt ) method which allows for a simple evaluation of this quantity at @xmath74 and near the mott - hubbard transition.@xcite    in fig .",
    "[ f.largedoc ] we show the theoretical prediction using the value of @xmath110  ev for the local repulsion and for the half - bandwidth @xmath111 and 0.95  ev for  and , respectively .",
    "note that the spectra do not display the drude contribution as it corresponds to a delta - function at @xmath13 since our model does not contain disorder and the calculation is performed at @xmath74 .",
    "the particular lineshape that we obtain is originated in the behavior of the spectral density of states that is obtained within the ipt method as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.largeddos ] . we should point out that while the details of the line shape may not be correctly given by this method , the main distribution of the spectral weight of the various contributions and their systematic evolution are very reliably captured.@xcite    we observe that the theoretical results for the systematic dependence of the various contributions to the optical response by controlling the value of @xmath5 are in a better qualitative agreement with the experimental data of fig .  [ f.abshift ] than the previous calculation where we changed the value of @xmath4 .",
    "one of the most notable improvements consists in that the unexpected systematic evolution of the feature at @xmath109 , which shifts upward with increasing @xmath5 , is well qualitatively captured .",
    "this peculiar effect can be interpreted as a `` band repulsion '' between the hubbard band and the quasiparticle band .",
    "as we increase @xmath5 , the latter becomes broader and `` pushes '' the hubbard band further out .    however , there are still some discrepancies .",
    "such a large spectral weight redistribution is predicted to be concomitant with a large effective mass in the mean - field treatment of the hubbard model.@xcite this is , however , inconsistent with the observed effective mass in this system .",
    "moreover , in the optical conductivity spectra , there is apparently a notable discrepancy in respect to the relative spectral weight of the peak `` a '' to the peak `` b '' .",
    "it is remarkably suppressed in the experimental data , compared with the theoretical data .",
    "other discrepancies between some experimental results and the prediction of the mean - field approach for the electron correlation were also reported in the photoemission spectroscopy measurements in this system.@xcite in the mean - field fermi liquid approach , the renormalized quasiparticle band at @xmath89 should be narrowed with increasing the value of @xmath3,@xcite but , in those experiments , the quasiparticle band - width remains broad , even if the system approaches to the mott transition .",
    "since the peak `` a '' has been assigned to the transitions associated with the quasiparticle band , the conspicuous suppression in spectral intensity of the peak `` a '' reflects the broadness of the quasiparticle band .",
    "the broad quasiparticle band also accounts for the lack of the strong mass enhancement in this system .",
    "as discussed in the preceding paper,@xcite the momentum - dependent self - energy becomes significant near the mott transition , resulting in a reduction of the mass enhancement .",
    "although our measurement can not clarify the validity of introducing a momentum - dependent self - energy , we conclude that there must be other interactions not present in the mean - field treatment of the electron correlation in the metallic regime close to the mott transition .",
    "finally , the presence of the `` anomalous '' contribution at low frequencies that extends down to @xmath112 in the theoretical data sheds a different light for the interpretation of the drude - like response discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : mass ] .",
    "it may be possible to say that the deviation from the simple drude model would be partly due to this `` anomalous '' contribution .",
    "the origin of this effect is again traced to the presence of the incoherent contribution coming from the low energy tails of the hubbard bands that is observed in the theoretical density of states . however ,",
    "it is experimentally very difficult to disentangle unambiguously the contribution of the coherent optical response of carriers and that of the incoherent process in optical conductivity , so this issue remains an open question .",
    "this study has aimed at elucidating the electronic structure of the correlated metallic vanadate by means of the optical spectroscopy measurements . we have synthesized the  system to control solely the 3@xmath1 band - width without varying the band filling .",
    "we have found that the low energy contribution to the optical conductivity spectra can not be reproduced by the simple drude model with the energy - independent scattering rate and effective mass .",
    "the energy - dependent @xmath46 determined by the generalized drude model shows relatively large energy dependence .",
    "however , @xmath46 is proportional to @xmath21 rather than that of the electron - electron scattering @xmath79 .",
    "the effective mass of the v 3@xmath1 electron has been evaluated from the plasma frequency .",
    "the value of @xmath64 gradually increases with decreasing the band - width @xmath5 .",
    "however , any symptom of the critical mass enhancement has not been observed , even though the system is close to the mott transition .",
    "we observed two anomalous peaks in the optical conductivity spectra around 1.7  ev and 3.5  ev . these features can be assigned to the possible combinations of transitions between the incoherent and coherent bands of quasiparticles around the fermi level .",
    "this large spectral weight redistribution substantiates the strong electron correlation in this system , which is , however , not concomitant with a large effective - mass enhancement .",
