    "the area of numerical relativity is very complex with many factors influencing the calculations . due to this complexity , choosing a best numerical scheme for solving problems in general relativity ( gr ) may be of particular importance in order to have a long term stability and to minimize truncation errors . at the same time",
    ", problems in numerical relativity usually demand a large amount of computational resources .",
    "hence it is also desirable to choose a scheme which best exploits the available computer power at any given time , i.e. provides accurate results with a minimal number of operations .",
    "first and foremost the scheme needs to be numerically stable , but in addition to this basic ( but not always trivially established ) property , there are a number of other features , such as accuracy , dissipation and dispersion properties , which may have important impacts on the numerical solutions as well .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate numerical properties ( in particular dispersion , stability and dissipation ) of some numerical schemes which can be used to solve gr type equations , allowing users of these schemes to estimate potential pitfalls and limitations of the schemes .",
    "the schemes that are being analyzed are the iterative crank - nicolson scheme ( icn ) , the third and fourth order runge - kutta schemes ( rk3 and rk4 ) and a nonlinear version of the classical courant - friedrichs - levy scheme ( cfln ) .",
    "a unique aspect of numerical gr is that the integration may be affected not only by stability of the scheme , but also by constraint and gauge instabilities which are intrinsic to the equations themselves . in order to separate these effects from the stability of the schemes and to investigate strengths and weaknesses of the different schemes ,",
    "we want to apply the schemes to simpler scalar wave equations .",
    "numerical schemes are usually analyzed by their application to the standard linear scalar wave equation ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) however , they are usually applied to solve nonlinear problems . by use of a classical von neumann analysis",
    ", we analyze properties of the schemes applied to both the standard scalar linear wave equation and to a nonlinear scalar wave equation , which is designed to mimic some properties of the nonlinear terms in the einstein equations . by this",
    "we hope to expand our knowledge of the behavior of the schemes in a regime which is closer to the computational reality of numerical gr then a sole analysis of the schemes in the fully linear regime .",
    "the non - linear wave equation , a perturbation analysis of it and the numerical schemes are presented in section [ sec : theory ] .",
    "the results from the von neumann analysis of the schemes applied to the scalar linear and nonlinear wave equations are presented in section [ sec : linear ] and [ sec : nlwave ] respectively .",
    "to support the analytic results , numerical results are presented in section [ sec:4 ] .",
    "in this section we present the numerical schemes which we will analyze in subsequent sections , the non - linear scalar wave equation to which we will apply the schemes and the method by which we will be analysis the schemes .",
    "consider the following scalar , quasi - linear , hyperbolic partial differential equation of two independent variables , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xcite ) : @xmath2 or cast into first order form : @xmath3 this equation is essentially the standard scalar wave equation with an added non - linear term .",
    "the equation is interesting because the non - linear term mimics part of the non - linearities present in gr equations .",
    "this can be seen by recalling that the structure of a ricci tensor @xmath4 is @xmath5 , where christoffel symbols @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the metric . thus @xmath4 can be represented as a sum of the terms @xmath8 .",
    "equation thus mimics a type of non - linearity present in gr equations @xmath9 .",
    "especially equations resembles the evolutionary part of gr equation in a standard adm 3 + 1 form ( with zero shift and constant lapse ) .",
    "we expect that in order to successfully apply the schemes to gr equations they must be applicable equation .",
    "equation posses a large number of non - trivial solutions @xcite . for test purposes we use two particular analytical solutions to this equation : a spatial constant solution : @xmath10 and an exponential solution : @xmath11      we wish to analyze the analytical behavior of small amplitude perturbations of solutions and .",
    "let @xmath12 be a base solution of equation and let @xmath13 be a perturbed solution , with @xmath14 .",
    "we linearize around @xmath15 and obtain a linear equation for the perturbations @xmath16 or @xmath17 where @xmath18 consider perturbations of the form : @xmath19 where @xmath20",
    ". then the dispersion relation is @xmath21 substituting @xmath22 into equation and separating real and imaginary parts we obtain : @xmath23 @xmath24 from it follows that @xmath25 , hence the growth rate of a perturbation @xmath26 is @xmath27 we see that a base solution is stable if @xmath28 and otherwise it is unstable .",
    "hence growing solutions are stable and decaying solutions are unstable .",
    "due to a local linearizion involved in the above analysis , the conclusion is strictly valid for perturbations with high wave numbers @xmath29 compared to the base solutions , and only if the growth rate is @xmath30 then that of the base solution . by looking at the spatial constant base solution , perturbed by a spatial constant perturbation ( @xmath31 ) , we can estimate the behavior of spatial constant or very long wavelength perturbations .    consider a spatial constant base solution perturbed by a small spatially constant perturbation : @xmath32 .",
    "then equation simplifies to an ordinary differential equation which can be solved to yield : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an arbitrary integration constant . from",
    "we see that for growing base solutions ( i.e positive @xmath35 in ) the second term is growing proportionally to the base solution , while the first term is decaying inversely proportionally to the base solution , hence the relative error is decreasing towards a constant value proportional to @xmath34",
    ". that is , the perturbation is growing but it is not unstable",
    ". if the base solution is decaying ( i.e. negative @xmath35 in ) , the first term increases rapidly as @xmath36 and the solution becomes unstable as the relative error grows unbounded .",
    "the four schemes that we are investigating are    * iterative crank - nicolson * 3rd order runge - kutta * 4th order runge - kutta * courant - friedrichs - levy nonlinear    the first three schemes are based on the method of lines approach @xcite , while the courant - friedrichs - levy nonlinear scheme is based on the classic central - difference , second - order explicit scheme introduced in 1928 by courant , friedrichs and levy @xcite .",
    "the schemes are defined as follows :      the iterative crank - nicolson scheme ( icn ) is an explicit , iterative scheme which was developed by matt choptuik from the classic implicit crank - nicolson scheme @xcite , @xcite . to solve equtation",
    ", we define the icn - scheme as follows .",
    "first the iteration process is initiated : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the centered second order accurate finite difference approximation to the second order spatial derivative , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are determined at mesh points @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the non - linear term ( i.e for eq .",
    "@xmath44 ) . the scheme is then iterated : @xmath45 @xmath46 $ ] ) , and finally the dependent variables at the next time step are : @xmath47 as shown in @xcite and @xcite , the optimal number of iterations , for the scalar wave equation is @xmath48 , which is the scheme that we will investigate in this paper .",
    "this scheme can be shown to be second order accurate in both time and space by a taylor series expansion @xcite,@xcite .",
    "to solve eq .",
    ", the 3rd order runge - kutta scheme ( rk3 ) is defined as follows @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50\\\\      g^{(1)}_i & = \\delta t \\left [   k_i^n\\right]\\\\      k^{(2)}_i & = \\delta t \\left [ \\delta^2 \\left ( g_i^n + \\frac{g^{(1)}_i}{2}\\right ) + nlt\\left ( g_i^n+      \\frac{g^{(1)}_i}{2 } , k_i^n+ \\frac{k^{(1)}_i}{2 } \\right)\\right]\\\\       g^{(2)}_i & = \\delta t \\left [   k_i^n+ \\frac{k^{(1)}_i}{2}\\right]\\\\      k^{(3)}_i & = \\delta t \\left [ \\delta^2 \\left ( g_i^n - g^{(1)}_i + 2g^{(2)}_i\\right ) + nlt\\left (      g_i^n-       g^{(1)}_i + 2g^{(2)}_i , k_i^n- k^{(1)}_i + 2k^{(2)}_i \\right)\\right]\\\\      g^{(3)}_i & = \\delta t \\left [   k_i^n- k^{(1)}_i + 2k^{(2)}_i \\right ]    \\end{split}\\ ] ] this scheme can be shown to be second order accurate in space and third order accurate in time by a taylor series expansion .      to solve eq .",
    "the 4th order runge - kutta scheme ( rk4 ) is defined as follows @xcite : @xmath51 where @xmath50\\\\      g^{(1)}_i & = \\delta t \\left [   k_i^n\\right]\\\\      k^{(2)}_i & = \\delta t \\left [ \\delta^2 \\left ( g_i^n + \\frac{g^{(1)}_i}{2}\\right ) + nlt\\left ( g_i^n+      \\frac{g^{(1)}_i}{2 } , k_i^n+ \\frac{k^{(1)}_i}{2 } \\right)\\right]\\\\       g^{(2)}_i & = \\delta t \\left [   k_i^n+ \\frac{k^{(1)}_i}{2}\\right]\\\\      k^{(3)}_i & = \\delta t \\left [ \\delta^2 \\left ( g_i^n + \\frac{g^{(2)}_i}{2}\\right ) + nlt\\left ( g_i^n+      \\frac{g^{(2)}_i}{2 } , k_i^n+ \\frac{k^{(2)}_i}{2 } \\right)\\right]\\\\       g^{(3)}_i & = \\delta t \\left [   k_i^n+ \\frac{k^{(2)}_i}{2}\\right]\\\\      k^{(4)}_i & = \\delta t \\left [ \\delta^2 \\left ( g_i^n + g^{(3)}_i\\right ) + nlt\\left (      g_i^n+g^{(3)}_i , k_i^n + k^{(3)}_i \\right)\\right]\\\\      g^{(4)}_i & = \\delta t \\left [   k_i^n + k^{(3)}_i \\right ]    \\end{split}\\ ] ] this scheme can be shown to be second order accurate in space and fourth order accurate in time by a taylor series expansion .",
    "another approach to solving eq . numerically is to notice that without the non - linear term , equation is a scalar wave equation which can be solved by the classic explicit scheme by courant , friedrichs and levy @xcite(see also cp . 10 in @xcite ) : @xmath52 we can cast this scheme into a first order form : @xmath53 now , in order to use this scheme as a basis for solving equation , we must add a term to evolve the non - linear part , moreover , we wish to do this with second - order accuracy at the grid points ( @xmath54 ) to ensure overall second - order accuracy of the scheme .",
    "we do this by evaluating the non - linear term using the following predictor - corrector style approach @xcite : @xmath55    this scheme can be shown to be second order accurate in both space and time by a taylor series expansion .",
    "an advantage of the scheme is that the second - order accuracy is achieved with a relatively small number of right hand side operations , to calculate one time step cfln requires 2 evaluations of the non - linear terms , compared to 3 evaluations required for the icn and rk3 schemes and 4 evaluations required for the rk4 scheme .",
    "it is also noted that the scheme is staggered in time , i.e. initial values are required at points @xmath56 .      to investigate the properties of the numerical schemes we use a von neumann analysis following a standard approach @xcite,@xcite : all the schemes can be represented by the following evolution operator : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a set of dynamical variables , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are temporal and spatial indices respectively and @xmath61 enumerates the dynamic variables . in our case , the operator @xmath62 may depend on all components of @xmath63 at grid points ( @xmath64 ) corresponding to a time layer @xmath59 ( or a combination of @xmath59 and @xmath65 in the staggered case of cfln scheme ) .",
    "perturbing @xmath58 as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the background solution , substituting equation into and doing a taylor - expansion , we obtain    @xmath68    assuming a perturbation of the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the perturbation wave number and @xmath20 , and substituting into we obtain @xmath71 the _ amplification matrix _",
    "@xmath72 @xmath73 holds information about properties of the numerical schemes .    for a linear finite difference equation ,",
    "the amplification matrix only depends on the discretization parameters @xmath74 , @xmath75 and the wave number @xmath76 , and needs to be calculated only once in order to know properties of the scheme at all times and grid points . for non - linear schemes the amplification matrix depends on @xmath67 and must in principle be evaluated at _ all _ spatial points and at _ all _ points in time .",
    "the generally complex eigenvalues of the amplification matrix , @xmath77 , hold information about the amplification and speed of a given perturbation for a single time step which can be extracted by calculating the modulus and argument of the eigenvalues respectively.the classic condition for numerical stability is that the spectral radius ( i.e. the largest modulus of the eigenvalues ) of the amplification matrix is less than or equal to @xmath78 for all wave numbers @xcite , however this excludes the possibility of growing exponential solutions . a less strict stability requirement ( the von neumann stability criterion ) which allows for exponentially growing solutions",
    "is that the eigenvalues must satisfy @xmath79 for all @xmath76 @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will refer to the spectral radius @xmath80 as the amplification factor .",
    "we presents amplification factors as a function of @xmath81 which runs in the range @xmath82 $ ] with @xmath83 corresponding to the nyquist frequency .",
    "it should be noted that due to the local linearizion involved in calculating the eigenvalues for non - linear schemes , the von neumann analysis is only locally valid .",
    "this also means that the analysis can not be trusted for non - local wave modes , i.e. small wave numbers .",
    "however , we _ are _ most interested in high wave numbers , as experience tells us that numerical instabilities usually arises first at the nyquist frequencies .",
    "hence for analyzing the stability of a scheme one searches for conditions under which equation is valid , focusing on the nyquist frequency , which usually reduces to a restriction on the relationship between @xmath74 and @xmath75 , known as the courant number @xmath84 .",
    "before studying the non - linear schemes , we briefly summarize stability , dissipation and dispersion properties of the schemes applied for a scalar linear wave equation @xmath85    table [ tab : stableinterval ] shows which courant intervals satisfies the von neumann stability criterion for the nyquist frequency as calculated by a von neumann analysis in the limit @xmath86 .

    "these figures are representative of the dissipative behavior of the four schemes .",
    "the plot ( and all plots in this section ) is valid for all choices of @xmath75 .    for zero wave numbers all schemes are non - dissipative , but with increasing wave numbers and increasing courant numbers the method of lines schemes shows monotonically increasing dissipation , with icn being the most dissipative scheme followed by the rk3 and rk4 scheme respectively .",
    "for very high wave numbers the dissipation for the method of lines schemes shows a non - monotonic behavior as can be seen by comparing figures [ fig:5 ] .",
    "we see that the icn scheme is still , generally , the most dissipative scheme , but as courant numbers are increased towards the stable limit , the dissipation at the nyquist frequency vanishes and the maximal dissipation is seen for smaller wave numbers .",

    "this shows how the nyquist frequency has maximal dissipation at around @xmath89 ( where @xmath90 is the maximal stable courant number for the corresponding scheme ) , after which the dissipation at the nyquist frequency goes to zero just before numerical instability sets in .",

    "the dispersion errors for the rk3 and cfln schemes conversely are minimized for their respective maximal stable courant numbers .",
    "the cfln scheme in this limit has zero dispersion errors , while the rk3 still has a non - vanishing ( but minimized ) dispersion error .",

    "well with the perturbation analysis and we see an amplification at the nyquist frequency , while the method of lines schemes all shows various degrees of damping , consistent with the results from section [ sec : linear ] .",
    "the amount of damping is dependent on the courant number as in the linear case , but also upon the spatial step size , @xmath75 . by choosing a smaller @xmath75 , for a fixed courant number ,",
    "@xmath74 decreases proportionally , by which any amplification also becomes smaller .",
    "however , with the amplification factor moving closer to @xmath98 , the damping for the method of lines schemes are shifted proportionally , i.e. the method of lines schemes may go from showing amplificative behavior to damping behavior at the nyquist frequency , with the choice of a smaller @xmath75 .",
    "we see this effect in figure [ fig : sqrta ] for the icn scheme .",
    "if we for the same solution had chosen a sufficiently small @xmath75 , the other method of lines schemes would also have shown damping behavior at the nyquist frequency .",
    "the qualitative behavior of the cfln scheme , in contrast , is unaffected by the choice of @xmath75 for reasonably small @xmath75 .",
    "for very large @xmath75 , all the schemes shows abnormal behavior which is caused by the fact that the base solution in this case changes much more rapid then the temporal resolution allows for .",

    "we see that cfln is an amplificative scheme whereas the method of lines schemes displaying certain amount of dumping .",
    "we note that in order to reproduce a correct behavior of perturbed analytic solutions the scheme must have the amplification number greater than one",
    ". however , in numerical simulations it may be better to dump growing large wave number ( short wavelength ) perturbations instead of trying to faitfully reproduce them .    for small wave numbers",
    "both the decaying and growing solutions are indicating amplificative behavior .",
    "we note that solution is spatially dependent , hence the spatially constant perturbation analysis from subsection [ sec : linear_analysis ] is not valid in this regime .",
    "nevertheless , comparing with figures [ fig : sqrt ] where we see ( and expect ) the same behavior it seems plausible that the amplificative behavior seen in the figures is an expected behavior .    as a closing remark to this section",
    ", we note that all schemes and solutions has been tested in the limit @xmath100 to investigate the stability properties of the schemes in the non - linear regime and we have found that all schemes agree with the stability intervals for the linear case ( table [ tab : stableinterval ] ) for all solutions .",
