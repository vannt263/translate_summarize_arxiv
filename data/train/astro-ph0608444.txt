    "observations of massive galaxies at high redshift with the _ hubble space telescope _ and the _ spitzer space telescope _ are revolutionizing our knowledge of the early formation history of stars and galaxies . blue star forming galaxies at @xmath15 with stellar masses @xmath21@xmath9  are routinely identified from optical imaging ( steidel et al .",
    "1996a , b,2004 ) , and have been studied in detail ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * shapley et al .",
    "2001,2005 ) , while near - infrared surveys at @xmath15 have uncovered substantial numbers of redder , more evolved galaxies with larger stellar masses @xmath22@xmath9   @xcite .",
    "some of these red galaxies appear to have stellar ages @xmath23 gyr , implying that they formed most of their stars before @xmath24 @xcite , and suggesting that massive galaxies should exist well beyond these redshifts .",
    "direct detection of such galaxies would place strong constraints on galaxy formation models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "tantalizingly , the most recent surveys with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) and the near - infrared camera and multiobject spectrograph ( nicmos ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ have identified sources at @xmath25 with fairly evolved stars and stellar masses of @xmath26@xmath9  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or perhaps more @xcite .",
    "critical for these results was access to the rest - frame wavelengths longward of the balmer/4000   break offered by the infrared array camera ( irac ; @xcite ) on _ spitzer_. without mid - infrared photometry to very faint magnitudes the stellar ages and masses of @xmath27 galaxies are poorly constrained .    in this letter , we extend mass estimates to @xmath28 by analyzing the mid - infrared fluxes of 6 @xmath0-dropout candidates found in the hubble ultra deep field ( udf ) by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2004 , hereafter b04 ) .",
    "these candidates were selected from exceptionally deep optical acs ( beckwith et al . in prep ) and near - infrared nicmos imaging @xcite , and when combined with the ultradeep irac data available there , offer us an ideal opportunity to verify their reality and to study their stellar populations .",
    "the stellar masses and ages of @xmath0-dropout galaxies would provide us with the first direct look at galaxy formation at @xmath29 , building on the comprehensive @xmath30 study ( bouwens et al .",
    "where necessary , we assume an @xmath31 cosmology with @xmath32  km  s@xmath12mpc@xmath12 .",
    "magnitudes are expressed in the ab photometric system .",
    "the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; dickinson et al .",
    ", in prep ) observed the udf with irac in two epochs , each time integrating for @xmath33 hours in the @xmath34 , and @xmath35 m channels .",
    "we estimate limiting depths in the combined irac images by measuring the effective flux variation in random apertures on empty background regions .",
    "the limits for point sources are 27.7 , 27.2 , 25.1 , and 24.9 in the four channels ( 1@xmath36 , total , 25 diameter aperture ) .",
    "we supplement the observations with deep @xmath37-band data from the _ very large telescope _ and _ magellan _",
    "( labb et al . in prep ) and we use an independent reduction of udf nicmos data with improved noise properties and fewer artifacts ( * ? ? ? * hereafter b06 ) .",
    "the new nicmos images revealed that 2 of the original 6 @xmath0-dropouts were electronic ghosts of nearby bright stars ; hence we removed them from the sample .    matching acs / nicmos and irac photometry is challenging because of the much larger size and extended wings of the irac point - spread functions ( psfs ) resulting in flux contamination by nearby foreground sources .",
    "visual inspection shows that 2 @xmath0-dropouts are substantially blended and all 4 are likely to contain at least some flux from nearby objects .",
    "we have developed a technique to robustly subtract the contaminating flux ( labb et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "briefly , we first detect sources with sextractor @xcite in a summed nicmos @xmath38 image to determine the light distributions at high resolution using the pixels in the `` segmentation '' maps .",
    "we then convolve these template images individually with a carefully constructed kernel to match it to the irac psf .",
    "third , we fit all detected sources , including neighbors , simultaneously to the registered irac image , leaving only the flux scalings as free parameters .",
    "finally , we subtract the best - fit images of all neighboring sources .    after cleaning the irac images , we performed conventional aperture photometry in @xmath39 , and @xmath35 m bands in 25 diameter apertures .",
    "photometry in the acs @xmath40 , nicmos @xmath41 , and @xmath37 bands was done in 09 diameter apertures and we obtained magnitudes and limits consistent with b04 .",
    "we summarize the photometry in table  1 .",
    "figure 1 shows the _ hst_/acs+nicmos and the combined _ spitzer_/irac images of the @xmath0 dropouts .",
    "two objects ( i d 964 and 1417 ) are unambiguously detected in @xmath1 m ( @xmath42 ) and in the slightly shallower @xmath2 m ( @xmath43 . two others ( i d 950 and 1125 ) are only marginally detected , but are probably real as the sum of their @xmath44 and @xmath2 m images reveals a visible source . unfortunately , the irac observations are not deep enough to definitively confirm or reject the reality of the undetected sources . none of the candidates are visible at @xmath45 and @xmath35 m .",
    "to evaluate the robustness of the deblending photometry , we performed the procedure independently on the first and second epoch irac data ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "reassuringly , we measure consistent fluxes and we detect the brightest , most promising sources 964 and 1417 in each dataset individually .",
    "the @xmath1 m magnitudes are faint , ranging from 25.3 to 27.0 , with @xmath46 m colors in the range -0.4 to 1.0 .",
    "the irac detected objects 964 and 1417 are the reddest , showing a factor of @xmath47 rise in @xmath48 flux densities between @xmath49 and @xmath1 m , while the seds are flatter at @xmath50 m and @xmath51 m ( see table  1 ) . the rise at @xmath1 m is similar in strength to what is found in spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at @xmath52 @xcite , and suggests the presence of a substantial redshifted balmer break , indicative of evolved stellar populations .",
    "we fit stellar population synthesis models of @xcite and a @xcite obscuration law to the broadband fluxes to constrain the stellar populations .",
    "the models assume solar metallicity and a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) between 0.1 and 100  @xmath9 .",
    "we explore three different star formation histories ( sfhs ) : a single age burst ( ssp ) , an exponentially declining star formation rate ( sfr ) with a timescale of 100  myr ( @xmath53 ) , and constant star formation ( csf ) .",
    "we leave the redshift , mass , age , and extinction as free parameters .",
    "we find acceptable fits for all sources ( see table  2 and figure  3 ) and obtain confidence intervals on the parameters with monte carlo simulations .",
    "the best - fit redshifts vary from 6.7 to 7.4 and most monte carlo solutions are in a narrow range around the best fit indicating that the redshift is well constrained .",
    "old stellar populations at @xmath54 fit the data poorly as they do not reproduce the strong break across the @xmath55 , and @xmath56 bands and the blue near - infrared continuum .",
    "even so , we note that 3% and 11% of the solutions for object 1417 and 1125 , allowed a redshift of @xmath54 when the random flux variations `` conspired '' to suppress the break .",
    "the best - fit models have average rest - frame optical colors of @xmath57 and @xmath58band luminosities @xmath59 for the irac - detected ( undetected ) sources .",
    "determinations of the stellar population age and mass depend on the assumed star formation history and metallicity . for the whole sample ,",
    "@xmath53 models fit the best , with ages of @xmath60  myr and instantaneous sfrs of @xmath61  @xmath9  yr@xmath12 . converting the rest - frame @xmath62  luminosities directly into ( absorption - corrected ) sfrs @xcite results in similar values .",
    "nevertheless , the degeneracy between age and dust prevents us from placing firm limits on the ages and sfrs .",
    "the stellar masses are generally better constrained . as expected , the irac - detected galaxies 964 ( @xmath63 ) and 1417 ( @xmath64 ) are the reddest , most massive , and oldest in the sample .",
    "the average uncertainties on the masses are approximately a factor of @xmath65 .",
    "the extreme ssp and csf models set lower and upper boundaries to the masses , ages , and sfrs , whereas assuming sub - solar metallicities ( @xmath66 ) instead of solar results in 30% higher ages and 20% higher masses . because all sfhs and metallicities provide equally acceptable fits to the data , we will hereafter adopt the mean of the ssp and csf models and both metallicities as our fiducial values .",
    "we then find ages of @xmath10  myr , masses of @xmath67  @xmath9 , low reddening @xmath13 , and star formation rates of @xmath68  @xmath9  yr@xmath12 .",
    "using the goods dataset ( dickinson et al . in prep ) , we have estimated and analyzed the _ spitzer_/irac mid - infrared fluxes of 4 @xmath0-dropouts candidates , which were identified in the udf by b04 and remeasured more accurately in b06 .",
    "the sources are rare , with a surface density of 0.7  arcmin@xmath69 , and very faint , with observed magnitudes of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , placing them well beyond the spectroscopic capabilities of current telescopes , but in reach of future facilities such as jwst and alma .",
    "irac directly confirms the reality of two sources , while two others are marginally detected .",
    "modeling of the broadband fluxes strongly supports their interpretation as @xmath3 galaxies with substantial stellar masses @xmath67 and ages @xmath10  myr .    using the redshift selection function for the @xmath0-dropout sample ( b04 ) , we obtain an effective volume of 9000 mpc@xmath72 to @xmath73 and we infer a stellar mass density of @xmath17  @xmath9mpc@xmath18 . comparing to the stellar mass density at lower redshifts , computed using similar techniques to similar luminosities , we find a continuing decrease where the density at @xmath3 is 95% , 22% of that at @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "recent smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations in a @xmath75cdm universe predict stellar mass- and number densities for massive ( @xmath76m@xmath77 ) galaxies of @xmath78  @xmath9  mpc@xmath18 and @xmath79  mpc@xmath18 ( sph g6 run , @xcite ) , remarkably close to the minimum estimates for our sample ( @xmath80  @xmath9mpc@xmath18 and @xmath81  mpc@xmath18 to the same mass limit ) .",
    "however , we can not exclude additional stellar mass residing in massive non - starforming or dust - enshrouded galaxies , which the @xmath0-dropout criteria would have missed .",
    "the ages of the two most massive ( irac - detected ) @xmath0-dropouts suggest that the bulk of their stellar mass formed at even higher redshifts @xmath20 , during the epoch of cosmic reionization @xcite .",
    "we can place a simple upper limit on the contribution of high - mass galaxies to reionization , by calculating the maximum sfr densities implied by the observed stellar masses and ages for these objects . taking the maximum masses and dividing it by the minimum ages ( @xmath82myr ) ,",
    "we infer a substantial sfr density 0.04  m@xmath77yr@xmath12  mpc@xmath18 . this is higher than calculated directly from the rest - frame uv luminosities at @xmath83 to the same limits @xcite , but still more than @xmath84 times too small to reionize the universe at the lowest probable redshift @xmath85 @xcite for canonical assumptions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also yan et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the simplest explanation for the lack of ionizing photons provided by high - mass galaxies at @xmath14 is that low - mass galaxies beyond our current detection limits were primarily responsible for reionization @xcite .",
    "other possibilities are that massive galaxies are missing from current surveys and are unaccounted for in the models , or that the observed galaxies had a top heavy imf , which would increase the ionizing efficiency per unit stellar mass . obviously , incompleteness , sample variance , and large scale structure dominate the uncertainties in our results .",
    "larger , very deep near - infrared surveys from the ground and from space will address this issue in more detail .",
