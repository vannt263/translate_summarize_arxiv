    "symmetries constitute one of the cornerstones of physics , being prominently displayed due to their fundamental role in the theoretical treatment of any system .",
    "symmetry principles not only reduce the extent of information which is required for the description of a physical system but also dictate the form of physical laws . under this prism ,",
    "the endeavour to extend the frontiers of our knowledge about nature is significantly based on the discovery of higher symmetry principles .    the usual pathway is to consider symmetry principles which hold _ globally _ for a physical system , explaining important phenomenological properties and facilitating the mathematical description .",
    "however , global symmetry usually is an idealized scenario , mainly met in models , approximative schemes or structurally simple isolated systems .",
    "the concept of local symmetry is usually introduced in the context of gauge transformations involving space - time dependent parameters which , in turn , imply that the associated symmetry is valid at a single space - time point .    between these two symmetry classes , the one valid at every point of space ( or space - time ) and the other valid at a single point , another category can be defined , where different symmetries are fulfilled in different spatial domains of finite extent .",
    "physical systems possessing the latter property usually emerge due to the breaking of a global symmetry so that new symmetries at different scales occur .",
    "such symmetry - associated patterns are manifest in extensively diverse structures encountered in nature  @xcite and dominate several length scales .",
    "therefore , it is a generic situation to deal with extended physical systems involving domains which are locally characterized by a certain symmetry .",
    "spatially localized symmetries can be intrinsic in complex systems such as , e.g. , large molecules  @xcite , quasicrystals  @xcite , self - organized , pattern - forming systems  @xcite or partially disordered matter  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", they can be present by design in multilayered photonic devices  @xcite , quantum semiconductor superlattices  @xcite , acoustic waveguides  @xcite or magnonic systems  @xcite .",
    "moreover , technological advances often require the breaking of global discrete symmetries in order to obtain flexible structures suitable for applications .",
    "despite the fact that systems belonging to the aforementioned classes have been extensively investigated , the theoretical framework for their mathematical description is usually restricted to the case of global symmetries . on a local level , studies on the structural features which affect",
    "spectral and localization properties has been carried out  @xcite , for instance in hybrid systems which are comprised of domains each with different quasiperiodic structure .",
    "however , little attention has been paid to the impact of explicit _ local symmetries _",
    ", implied by the breaking of a global symmetry , although they are obviously present and often coexist at different spatial scales . a rigorous theoretical treatment which addresses the local symmetry induced properties is missing and obviously a new point of view needs to be introduced .    a step towards this direction",
    "was recently made by introducing the concept of _ local parity _ ( lp ) @xcite .",
    "it was shown how a system s decomposition into mirror symmetric units relates to spectral properties and especially to perfect transmission resonances ( ptrs ) in aperiodic setups .",
    "the origin of perfect transmission in such systems , even though tentatively linked to symmetry concepts  @xcite , had yet been an unresolved issue , lacking a rigorous theory which directly relates perfect transmission in aperiodic and quasiperiodic setups to its underlying ( local ) symmetry properties . within the local parity approach",
    ", an unambiguous symmetry based classification of scattering states has been established @xcite , elucidating the link between perfect transmission and spatial domain symmetry .",
    "a classification of scattering states based on a setup s decomposition in locally symmetric domains leads to the question whether the identification of remnants of the broken global symmetry is possible and if so , how these remnants may determine the form of the scattered wave in the symmetry related domains in the same manner the bloch  @xcite and parity  @xcite theorems do when the corresponding translation and reflection symmetry are globally satisfied ( we use here the term _ parity theorem _ for the well known theorem of quantum mechanics concerning the commutation of the global inversion operator with the hamiltonian and the existence of common eigenstates for both operators ) . subsequently , another question is natural to be posed : what form , if any , will the generalized parity and bloch theorems acquire if global reflection or translation symmetry is broken ?",
    "the answer was given recently in ref .",

    "this formalism can handle connected or disconnected arbitrary , symmetric spatial domains of finite or infinite extent .",
    "the aim of the present work is twofold .",
    "firstly , we extend the theoretical framework established in  @xcite , emphasizing on the derivation of new properties of the scattered waves , which emerge from their phase and magnitude . the analysis is based on the invariant non - local currents induced by symmetry breaking .",
    "secondly , we introduce sum rules involving these invariants and we demonstrate how they are related to the transmission properties of waves which propagate in devices which are completely decomposable into locally symmetric subunits . in order to be self - contained we include in our presentation the derivation of the nonlocal currents and we demonstrate how they allow for the generalization of the bloch and parity theorems for arbitrary setups .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ invariants ] we derive a pair of symmetry induced nonlocal invariant currents for the discrete reflection and translation symmetry operations , which exist in arbitrary symmetry domains of a generic wave scattering setup . in sec .",
    "[ bloch ] we show how these currents allow the mapping of the wave function between the symmetry related domains , generalizing the bloch and parity theorems . in the limit of the global symmetry restoration",
    "we recover the usual forms of the theorems . in sec .",
    "[ scattering ] we demonstrate how scattering from aperiodic systems can be alternatively formulated by expressing the transfer matrix of a locally symmetric potential unit via the corresponding invariants and in sec .  [ scales ] we comment on the significance of the possible decompositions of a setup in multiple symmetry scales . using sum rules of the corresponding invariants we derive quantities which describe globally aperiodic devices which can be decomposed in locally symmetric domains and investigate their energy dependence and their relation to the transmission spectrum .",

    "we first link the concept of translational and reflection symmetry to the properties of stationary waves described by the helmholtz equation .",

    "an infinite , periodic system as the one illustrated in fig .  [ fig1](a ) belongs to this class .",
    "however , the generic case in realistic physical systems , is that global symmetries are broken .",
    "two cases of this symmetry breaking can be identified :    \\(i ) the asymptotic conditions violate the symmetry whereas a central part of the setup still preserves some symmetry .",
    "this is e.g. the case for a scattering situation with asymmetric asymptotic waves while the scattering potential still retains the corresponding symmetry property for all @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the scattering region where the potential acts ( see fig .",

    "of special interest is the case of systems which can be completely decomposed into parts that fulfill certain reflection or translation symmetries exactly .",
    "such systems form the special class of _ completely locally symmetric ( cls ) _ systems which extend the notion of periodicity or global parity symmetry . in the following sections we will extensively study such systems , revealing their intriguing properties .",

    "we also restrict the wave to normal incidence on the @xmath7-plane , such that it propagates along the @xmath8-axis .",

    "focusing on systems for which @xmath11 exhibits local symmetries we proceed by showing first the existence of nonlocal currents which are spatially constant within the finite domain(s ) where the medium obeys a specific symmetry .",
    "subsequently we demonstrate how these currents can be used to determine the structure of the solution of the associated wave equation in the symmetry related domain(s ) , generalizing the bloch and parity theorems for systems with reflection or translational symmetry in restricted spatial domains .",
    "the analysis and the presentation of our theory is performed in one dimension assuming the wave propagation to be described by the helmholtz equation .",
    "however , it can be extended to higher dimensions in which case the translation symmetry can be directly generalized while the reflection symmetry is replaced by the inversion with respect to a point or reflection through a plane .    in order to treat wave propagation in inhomogeneous media within a unified framework we employ the helmholtz equation : @xmath19 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath8 .",
