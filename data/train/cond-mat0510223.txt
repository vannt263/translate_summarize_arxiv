    "many problems in complex soft matter systems are inherently multiscale in nature , i.e. , microscopic interactions are coupled strongly to meso- and macroscopic properties . despite the increasing computational power and ongoing efforts to enhance the efficiency of molecular dynamics ( md ) integration algorithms@xcite , all - atom md simulations are often incapable to cover the time and length scales needed in order to reach relaxation in a typical molecular system , such as a polymer solution or melt . in many cases",
    "it is also questionable , whether the huge amount of detail information might not even obscure the relevant structural information . on the other hand , details of the chemistry",
    "do not affect universal power laws but the prefactors of these power laws , which can vary by several orders of magnitude themselves .",
    "thus even on the more coarse - grained level it is advisable to keep a link to the specific chemistry under investigation@xcite .",
    "in addition typical soft matter systems can be quite inhomogeneous in a way , that different regions within one system are sufficiently described by more or less detail . a consistent and at the same time highly efficient ansatz to understand modern soft matter systems ( both of synthetic as well as biological origin ) has to take such considerations into account .",
    "one first way to tackle this , was to reduce the number of degrees of freedom by a systematic coarse - graining , which retains only those degrees of freedom that are relevant for the particular property of interest .",
    "examples of molecular systems where the coarse - graining approach has been used with much success are fluids@xcite , lipid bilayers @xcite , and polymer systems@xcite .",
    "since some specific chemical details are usually lost in the coarse - graining procedure , much effort has been devoted recently to the development of multiscale modeling approaches , where different parts of the system are modeled at different levels of detail to account for the local resolution requirement@xcite . in the dual - resolution modeling approach for studying the behavior of polymers near metal surfaces@xcite , for example",
    ", polymer chain ends that interact with the metal surface are represented partially atomistically while the remaining parts of the polymers , where lower resolution is adequate , are represented as bead - spring chains .",
    "however , the switching between different levels of resolution , i.e , the atomic and mesoscopic , is not allowed during the course of that md simulation , and therefore the initial level of detail and thereby the number of degrees of freedom in the system remain unchanged . since the chain ends that interact with the metal typically remain close to the surface and they only contain a small fraction of the whole system , an adaptive on - the - fly change of the molecules resolution is not strictly required for this class of systems .",
    "another approach reported in the literature concerns the link between quantum mechanical and classical md simulations . in this",
    "qm / mm approach a small subset of the system is defined and considered as quantum mechanical , while the rest is treated by a classical force field simulation . here",
    "the atoms as well as the regions of the different regimes are fixed from the very beginning @xcite , restricting the application to rather specific cases .",
    "in contrast , md simulations , in which the spatially localized atomistic domains frequently exchange particles with the remaining mesoscopic part of the system , would allow for much wider applications",
    ". then it would be possible to define certain areas or develop criteria for certain situations , which ask for a more detailed view , while the rest of the system can be treated on the more coarse - grained level .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to present a first attempt of an md simulation of that kind . because of that we here at first restrict ourselves to a most elementary model system",
    "of course one also could resort to monte carlo simulations , where different levels of detail are combined .",
    "this actually would be somewhat simpler because of the purely stochastic nature of this simulation method .",
    "since we are eventually aiming at molecular systems , where collective motions are crucial , we decided to stick to the md approach .",
    "existing hybrid md methods that concurrently couple different length scales have been developed to study solid state systems , where atomistic md was either combined with the finite elements method@xcite or it was linked to a quantum mechanical model@xcite . to our knowledge , however , in pursuit of this objective no adaptive hybrid atomistic / mesoscale particle - based md method , which would allow to dynamically adjust the level of detail , which means the adjustment of the degrees of freedom in the system , has been developed so far .    in this paper",
    "we present a novel adaptive resolution md scheme that combines a full atomistic description of a desired region of the system with a mesoscale treatment of the remaining part . the key feature of the new method is that it allows to dynamically adapt the level of a given molecule s resolution according to its position in the system .",
    "hence , the number of degrees of freedom is not a conserved quantity in our md simulations .",
    "furthermore , the presented method is not restricted to couple only the atomistic and mesoscopic levels of detail but can also be applied to systems with mesoscopic domains that are described at different levels of coarse - graining . here",
    "we present a first test case , showing that such an approach is feasible .",
    "therefore the new approach is tested for a simple model liquid consisting of tetrahedral molecules .",
    "the simulation box is divided into two regions : one containing  atomistically  resolved tetrahedral molecules , the other containing coarse - grained spherical molecules .",
    "molecules are allowed to freely move between the two regions while changing their level of resolution accordingly .",
    "the results show that the statistical properties of the corresponding fully atomistic system are accurately reproduced by using the proposed hybrid scheme .",
    "in particular , gradients in the chemical potential across the artificial interface where the resolution changes and corresponding spurious fluxes can be avoided . although we applied the new method here to a generic test system it should find application in more realistic physical systems .",
    "there has been an initial attempt reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where md simulation of an inhomogeneously coarse - grained system of liquid methane has been described . there",
    "the starting point were two established models for methane , a five site atomistic and a one site spherical where the interaction between molecules of different species was derived by standard lennard - jones mixing rules with the hydrogens of the atomistic invisible to the spherical molecules .",
    "in this case it turned out that an effective flux between the two different regimes occurred .",
    "this effect is partially due to the different equilibrium state points described by the two models , but in any case in that approach no effective potential between coarse - grained molecules was derived .",
    "our approach differs from that since here we derive such potentials in such a way that the two regimes are in true thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the organization of the article is as follows . in section 2",
    "the methodology is presented , whereby in the first step a coarse - grained model is derived and parameterized from a fully atomistic system and then , in the second step , the atomic and mesoscopic length scales are systematically coupled in a hybrid atomistic / mesoscopic model . the computational details are given in section 3 .",
    "the results and discussion are presented in section 4 , followed by conclusions in section 5 .",
    "in this section , the model systems are described and the methodology for the adaptive multiscale md simulations is presented .",
    "first , we introduce our reference explicit all - atom ( _ ex _ ) model .",

    "we use @xmath12 as a unit of energy .",
    "all atoms have the same excluded volume diameter @xmath13 , where @xmath13 is the unit of length .",
    "the neighboring atoms in a given molecule @xmath9 are linked via an attractive fene potential @xmath14 ; & r_{i\\alpha j\\alpha}\\le r_0\\\\                         \\infty ; & r_{i\\alpha j\\alpha } > r_0                    \\end{array}\\right.\\label{eq.9}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with divergence length @xmath15 and stiffness @xmath16 , so that the average bond length is approximately @xmath17 for @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the temperature of the system and @xmath20 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the functional form of these potentials and their parameters are the same as usually employed in polymer md simulations@xcite .",
    "next , we map the atomistic model to a coarse - grained ( _ cg _ ) mesoscopic model . for the latter",
    "we have chosen a system composed of @xmath0 one - particle molecules schematically depicted in figure [ fig.1 ] ( a ) ( consider only the left blue molecule ) .",
    "a given coarse - grained molecule @xmath9 in the system has a mass @xmath21 equal to the total mass of the explicit tetrahedral molecule .",
    "all rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of atomistically resolved tetrahedral molecules are thus removed , and the number of nonbonded interactions is strongly decreased as well .",
    "we shall now find an effective pair potential between coarse - grained molecules such that the structural properties of the underlying atomistic model are reproduced .",
    "there is usually no unique way to coarse - grain to an effective pair potential , which is in general temperature and density dependent @xcite , just as in statistical mechanics there are different ways to perform a renormalization group step . here",
    ", we extract the effective pair potential from a center - of - mass radial distribution function ( rdf@xmath22 ) of the reference atomistic model using the potential of mean force @xmath23 as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the rdf@xmath22 of the all - atom system and @xmath26 is the derived effective pair potential@xcite .",
    "the effective potential obtained in this way is correct only in the limit of zero density , where the many - body contributions vanish . for systems with nonzero densities in principle many - body interactions",
    "would be needed just as for the classical renormalization group theory in statistical mechanics . in a similar spirit",
    "we here resort to the ( expected ) relevant part in order to gain a significant speed up in our simulations . because of that we use the pmf as the initial guess for the effective pair potential in systems with nonzero density .",
    "then this is further fine - tuned until the rdf@xmath22s and pressures of the reference atomistic and coarse - grained systems match@xcite . as it turns out",
    "( see the results and discussion section ) the effective pair potential acting between our coarse - grained molecules is significantly softer than the pair potential between atoms of the resolved molecules in accordance with the results previously found in the literature@xcite .",
    "let us now introduce a hybrid explicit / coarse - grained ( _ ex - cg _ ) model .",
    "consider a box of @xmath0 molecules where one half of the box is occupied by atomistically resolved four - atom tetrahedral molecules while the other half is filled up with the same number of corresponding coarse - grained one - particle molecules as schematically presented in figure [ fig.1 ] ( b ) .",
    "the two domains exchange molecules which adapt their level of resolution accordingly . to ensure that the transition between the two different levels of description is smooth ,",
    "i.e. , the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of a given molecule are gradually switched on / off as it crosses the boundary between the atomistic and coarse - grained domains , we also introduce an interface layer for handshaking between atomistic and mesoscale regions . in this regime",
    "also the rotational and vibrational velocities have to be reintroduced in a consistent way . due to the periodic boundary conditions employed in our simulations there are in fact two such layers as depicted in figure [ fig.1 ] ( b ) .",
    "since the total number of molecules @xmath0 in the system is a conserved quantity in our constant temperature simulations , we sample the phase space from the @xmath27 ensemble . however , the total number of degrees of freedom is not constant in this model .",
    "an alternative way compared to the similarities with renormalization group methods , which probably describes the situation even better , is the comparison to a first order phase transition .",
    "the rotational and vibrational part of the free energy then can be viewed as the latent heat at this transition . at equilibrium ,",
    "conditions analogous to two phase coexistence , @xmath28 must be automatically satisfied , where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 are the chemical potentials , pressures , and temperatures of the liquid in the atomistic and coarse - grained domains , respectively .",
    "these conditions ( [ eq.1 ] ) assure that there is no net flux of molecules between the atomistic and coarse - grained regions . to keep this absolute requirement",
    "also then defines a central task .",
    "this guarantees that the liquid is homogeneous across the box as it is in the reference fully atomistic system . from a molecular point of view",
    ", the artificial resolution boundary must be essentially invisible , i.e. , the molecules have to cross the border without experiencing any ` barrier ' .",
    "our approach to reach this objective is presented in the proceeding subsection .      to allow a coarse - grained molecule to find an energetically permissible orientation with respect to its neighboring molecules ( when it leaves the coarse - grained domain and is remapped into the atomistically resolved four - atom tetrahedral molecule ) we introduce an interface layer between the atomistic and coarse - grained regions , which contains hybrid molecules as presented in figure [ fig.1 ] .",
    "each hybrid molecule schematically shown in figure [ fig.1](a ) ( consider the middle molecule ) is composed of a tetrahedral molecule with an additional massless center - of - mass particle serving as an interaction site .",
    "this is similar to the flexible tip4p water model@xcite where apart from the interaction sites on the three atoms of a water molecule an additional interaction site is introduced along the symmetry axis between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms .",
    "thus , each time a coarse - grained molecule @xmath9 leaves that domain and enters the interface layer , it is remapped first into a hybrid molecule with the same center - of - mass position and a random orientation in space , where the relative positions of the tetrahedral atoms are taken from a molecular configuration corresponding to a randomly chosen molecule from the atomistic regime .",
    "each of the four explicit tetrahedral atoms in the hybrid molecule gains at this remapping a velocity equal to the velocity of the corresponding coarse - grained molecule to maintain the linear momentum of the molecule .",
    "in addition , the tetrahedral atoms are also assigned rotational / vibrational velocities corresponding to atoms of a random molecule from the atomistic region , where we subtract the total linear momentum of the latter molecule . in this way",
    "we ensure that the kinetic energy is distributed among all degrees of freedom according to the equipartition principle as @xmath35 of average kinetic energy per quadratic degree of freedom while retaining the linear momentum of the coarse - grained molecule .",
    "the center - of - mass interaction site moves obeying the constraints : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a center of mass of the molecule @xmath9 , @xmath38 is the position vector of the explicit tetrahedral atom @xmath8 in the molecule @xmath9 , @xmath39 is the center - of - mass velocity of the molecule @xmath9 , @xmath40 is the velocity of the explicit tetrahedral atom @xmath8 , and @xmath41 is the total mass of the molecule @xmath9 . in our case , @xmath42 and @xmath21 for all @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "each time a hybrid molecule crosses the boundary into atomistic regime it is remapped into a four - particle tetrahedral molecule with the four tetrahedral atoms retaining their current velocities and positions . in this model",
    "also the explicit tetrahedral molecules have the center - of - mass interaction sites , but only for the interactions with the hybrid and coarse - grained molecules . of course ,",
    "deep in the atomistic region , where the atomistically resolved molecules do not interact anymore with the hybrid and coarse - grained molecules the center - of - mass interaction site can be omitted . every time a four - particle tetrahedral molecule leaves the atomistic region and enters into the transition regime it is mapped into a hybrid molecule with the four tetrahedral atoms retaining instantaneous velocities and positions with the center - of - mass interaction site moving according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq.5 ] ) and ( [ eq.6 ] ) .",
    "similarly , as a hybrid molecule crosses a boundary to the coarse - grained region it is mapped into a coarse - grained molecule with a velocity equal to the center - of - mass velocity of the hybrid molecule given by eq .",
    "( [ eq.6 ] ) .    to couple the atomic and mesoscopic length scales we define in the spirit of thermodynamic perturbation approach@xcite the total intermolecular force acting between centers of mass of molecules @xmath9 and @xmath11 as @xmath45{\\bf   f}_{\\alpha\\beta}^{cm},\\label{eq.4}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the sum of all pair atom interactions between explicit tetrahedral atoms of the molecule @xmath9 and explicit tetrahedral atoms of the molecule @xmath11 and @xmath47 the vector @xmath48 is the relative position vector of atoms @xmath8 and @xmath10 , @xmath49 is the relative position vector of the centers of mass of the molecules @xmath9 and @xmath11 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the @xmath52 center - of - mass coordinates of the molecules @xmath9 and @xmath11 , respectively , and @xmath53 is the weighting function that determines the identity of a given molecule .",

    "the chosen maximal force magnitude value is so high that it has no effect on the dynamics of molecules in the atomistic region because there atoms never come this close together . therefore , by this force capping we only prevent possible force singularities that could emerge due to overlaps with the neighboring molecules when a given molecule enters the interface layer from the coarse - grained side as explained in the previous section .",

    "cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results show that there is no molecule number bias in the system and that the _ ex - cg _ system is homogeneous .",
    "note that @xmath149 is greatly reduced employing the adaptive resolution scheme on the _ ex - cg _ model in comparison with the fully atomistic model .",
    "the time evolution of the number of molecules in different regions of the system together with the @xmath149 is illustrated in figure [ fig.8 ] .",
    "the results clearly demonstrate that the system is in thermodynamical equilibrium , indicating that the conditions ( [ eq.1 ] ) are satisfied by our adaptive resolution scheme .",
    "although we have parameterized the effective potential to reproduce the structural properties of the _ ex _ system we can also compare the dynamical properties of the _ ex - cg _ with the _ ex _ model .",
    "for that purpose we have computed the self - diffusion coefficient , which is evaluated from the center - of - mass displacements using the einstein relation @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the center - of - mass position of the molecule @xmath9 at time @xmath152 and averaging is performed over all molecules and all choices of time origin .",
    "the self - diffusion coefficient of the _ ex _ and _ cg _ models calculated in the microcanonical ensemble , where the langevin thermostat is switched off after the initial warm - up run , are @xmath153 and @xmath154 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding values of the self - diffusion coefficient for the _ ex _ , _ cg _ , and _ ex - cg _ models with the langevin thermostat switched on are @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 , respectively . since we use the same time and length scales in all our three models different values of the self - diffusion coefficient in the _ ex _ and _ cg _ models ( with no langevin thermostat applied ) indicate that the coarse - grained molecules experience a slightly smaller intermolecular frictional hindrance in their motion compared to the explicit molecules .",
    "this indicates that the effective pair potential given in eq .",
    "( [ eq.11 ] ) introduces an effective time scale shift in the coarse - grained regime .",
    "this is known from other studies @xcite , where one actually takes advantage of that in order to reach very long simulation times@xcite .",
    "the apparent self - diffusion coefficient values of the _ ex _ and _ cg _ models are lower and much closer together when the langevin thermostat is applied due to the frictional forces arising from the coupling to the thermostat unlike to the case of polymers .",
    "there typically the friction of the thermostat is negligible compared to the friction between monomers .",
    "since the self - diffusion coefficient of the _ ex - cg _ model is close to the corresponding values for the _ ex _ and _ cg _ models we can conclude that the center - of - mass dynamics of the molecules is similar in all three models .    as the final test to demonstrate the reliability of the adaptive resolution scheme we have computed the number density profile of the _ ex - cg _ model .",
    "+    the results for the system with @xmath158 and @xmath159 are presented in figures [ fig.9 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the results in figure [ fig.9 ] ( a ) for the case of @xmath158 show that the explicit and coarse - grained regions have the same homogeneous density as the reference system while the density in the transition regime undergoes an oscillation around the reference value @xmath160 with a magnitude of approximately @xmath161 . in the case of @xmath159 ( figure [ fig.9 ] ( b ) ) a @xmath162 drop in the density occurs in the transition regime , which is compensated by the slight increase of the density in the explicit and coarse - grained regions .",
    "this artifact can be explained by considering the results displayed in figure [ fig.10 ] ( a ) , where the pressure of the system containing only hybrid molecules as a function of the constant value of the weighting function @xmath53 ( corresponding to the situation in the interface layer ) is illustrated .",
    "+    the pressure is increased in comparison to the pressure in the reference system .",
    "clearly the increase is most prominent for the most artificial case with @xmath163 , indicating that there still is a small pressure barrier in the interface region causing the density dip .",
    "this is also evident from results in figure [ fig.10 ] ( b ) , where the rdf@xmath22 and the potential of mean force of the system with @xmath163 are shown .",
    "the effective potential in a system containing only hybrid molecules with constant value of the weighting function changes in comparison to the all - atom system .",
    "this means that the hybrid molecules in the interface layers of the _ ex - cg _ model experience too strong effective interaction leading to the pressure variations in the interface layer .",
    "since the artifact occurs at constant values of @xmath53 it is an artifact of the linear combination of forces in eq .",
    "( [ eq.4 ] ) and not of the functional form of the weighting function @xmath53",
    ". it must be emphasized , however , that this artifact of the proposed adaptive resolution scheme is within a @xmath162 error and that similar artifacts , occurring at the boundary of two domains with different level of detail , are also characteristic for other hybrid schemes@xcite .",
    "the pressure variations in the interface layer could cause a spurious reflection of molecules from the boundary .",
    "however , the results presented in figure [ fig.11 ] , where the time evolution of two diffusion profiles is monitored for molecules that are initially localized at the two slabs with @xmath164 width neighboring the interface layer , show that this is not the case .     +    the molecules initially localized at the two slabs spread out symmetrically with time .",
    "this is because the self - diffusion coefficients of all models are approximately the same in the case of the applied langevin thermostat .",
    "thus , the two distributions occupy at time @xmath152 regions with mean square radius @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the center of the distribution at time @xmath167 , which is equal to @xmath168 for the left slab ( figure [ fig.11 ] ( a ) ) and @xmath169 for the right slab ( figure [ fig.11 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "since the diffusion profiles are symmetrical at any given time we can conclude that the artifact at the interface layer is too small to have any severe effect on the diffusion of molecules across the interface layer .",
    "a novel approach for efficient hybrid atomistic / mesoscale molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations has been presented in this paper .",
    "the new adaptive resolution md simulation scheme dynamically couples the atomic and mesoscale length scales of the studied system by allowing an on - the - fly dynamical interchange between molecules atomic and mesoscopic levels of description . in our approach",
    "the number of degrees of freedom is allowed to fluctuate during the course of simulation while the statistical properties of the underlying all - atom model are properly reproduced for both levels of detail . since the purpose of this paper was to develop the method , we restricted ourselves to a most simple model system of a molecular liquid with short - range repulsive interactions . even on this level a number of questions still have to be tackled , as there is the application to higher liquid densities for complex molecular liquids or the proper analysis and understanding of the the time scale problem , when the diffusion on the coarse - grained level is faster than on the all - atom level . for separate runs at the two levels of detail",
    "this is understood , while the occurrence within one simulation box still poses some conceptual problems . on the other hand",
    "the current density is in between a typical small molecule liquid and a polymeric fluid .",
    "thus we expect that already this approach can be generalized and applied to different realistic soft condensed matter systems where both atomic and mesoscopic length scales have to be considered",
    ". this can be either polymer solutions and melts , such as a synthetic or biological macromolecule embedded in a solvent .",
    "similarly our method should also find application for other polymer systems ( same force field ) , molecular liquids such as methane ( same geometry ) or water ( tetrahedral clusters ) , etc .",
    ", enabling to reach much larger length and time scales than for all - atom md simulations . in all cases the aim is to treat in a simulation only as many degrees of freedom as absolutely necessary for the question considered . in this sense",
    "the region of higher detail can be either given by a geometrical constraint , e.g. , close to a surface , or even be chosen on demand due to specific local conformations of a ( macro-)molecular system .",
