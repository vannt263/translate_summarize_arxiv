    "the study of idempotents also leads to results in the study of the moduli space of positive scalar curvature metrics , as in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "@xmath74    is @xmath81 , meaning it is bounded by @xmath82 .    in triangle @xmath83 in a graph ,",
    "let @xmath41 , denote the sides ; that is , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",

    "says that for a @xmath46-hyperbolic graph , there is @xmath87 such that all triangles are @xmath87-thin .",
    "let us replace @xmath46 with the max of @xmath46 and @xmath87 so that now the graph is @xmath46-hyperbolic and all triangles are @xmath46-thin .",
    "let us assume @xmath95 , which we may , because there are finitely many cases for @xmath96 , so we can shove those cases into the constant @xmath77 .",
    "consider the geodesic picture shown in the diagram , where @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 are geodesics .",

    "so now for fixed @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and for @xmath131 , @xmath132 , we have fixed @xmath110 , because @xmath133 has @xmath134 , and @xmath102 is just the @xmath135 right translate of the geodesic for @xmath50 , so @xmath136 is fixed , because it is just the product of the first @xmath137 edges of the geodesic of @xmath50 .",
    "now , @xmath138 , as a group element , has distance at most @xmath46 from @xmath136 , so there are @xmath139 possibilities for @xmath138 .    for @xmath140 fixed , as above , there are @xmath141 possibilities for @xmath142 , because @xmath143 is along @xmath104 , which is the geodesic of @xmath51 , and we showed above that @xmath144 .",
    "so @xmath142 is the product of the first @xmath57 edges of the geodesic of @xmath51 .",
    "for each of the @xmath145 choices of @xmath142 , there are at most @xmath146 choices of @xmath147 , because @xmath147 and @xmath142 are within @xmath145 of each other as group elements .",
    "thus , in total , for fixed @xmath140 , there are @xmath148 possibilities for @xmath147 .",
    "so we have , for fixed @xmath149 , there are @xmath150 choices of @xmath147 and @xmath148 choices of @xmath138 so there are @xmath151 choices of @xmath152 .",
    "but @xmath153 , so there are at most @xmath75 choices of @xmath65 for a given @xmath78 and @xmath140 .    there are @xmath78 choices of @xmath154 $ ] , so in total there are at most @xmath155 possible @xmath65 for a given @xmath78 , giving us the first statement in the lemma .",
    "adding up the values for different @xmath156 is adding up @xmath157 summands , each of which is @xmath158 , so we get that there are @xmath81 possible @xmath65 with @xmath159 and @xmath74 .",
    "now we complete the proof of the theorem .",
    "we are assuming that the conjugacy class of @xmath2 is infinite , so there are @xmath59 of arbitrarily large length . for large @xmath60 , consider some @xmath59 with @xmath160 .",
    "then for @xmath161 , we may consider @xmath162 .",
    "then @xmath163 , so we can map @xmath164 to the elements of the conjugacy class of @xmath2 of length in the range @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "@xmath165    by the above lemma , the pre - image of any element under @xmath166 has size at most @xmath82 , for constants @xmath167 depending only on @xmath2 and @xmath0 . but @xmath168 grows exponentially by a theorem in koubi ( also attached ) , that says that non - elementary hyperbolic groups have exponential growth .",
    "so the number of elements in the image of @xmath166 , grows at least with @xmath169 , which is still exponential .",
    "thus the conjugacy class of @xmath170 grows exponentially in @xmath60 , so @xmath56 has exponential growth , as desired .    for @xmath0 a non - elementary hyperbolic group and @xmath1 a non - torsion element",
    ", the conjugacy class of @xmath2 grows exponentially .    by the theorem , it suffices to show that the conjugacy class is infinite .",
    "let @xmath56 be the conjugacy class and @xmath171 be the centraliser .",
    "then @xmath172 , so if the conjugacy class is finite , then @xmath173 has finite index .",
    "but , by theorem 3.35 , @xmath171 is a finite extension of @xmath174 , so it is virtually cyclic . but",
    "any group is quasi - isometric to any finite index subgroup , so that would mean that @xmath0 is also virtually cyclic , which is impossible .",
    "in this section , we show the main result ; namely , we classify all traces on non - elementary word - hyperbolic groups .",
    "let @xmath0 be a non - elementary word - hyperbolic group .",
    "then the traces @xmath4 are exactly the linear combinations of @xmath5 given by @xmath6 where @xmath8 is an element of finite conjugacy class and @xmath7 is its conjugacy class .",
    "[ all traces ]    as was shown in @xcite [ theorem 3.27 ] , in a hyperbolic group , there are only finitely many conjugacy classes of torsion elements",
    ".    we will show that all infinite order elements have infinite conjugacy class .",
    "suppose , for the sake of contradiction that there is @xmath44 an element of infinite order with finite conjugacy class @xmath7 .",
    "then @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is the centraliser of @xmath0 . however , it was shown in @xcite [ theorem 3.35 ] that @xmath176 is a finite extension of the subgroup generated by @xmath8 , so that it is elementary .",
    "but then if @xmath7 is finite , then @xmath0 would also be elementary , a contradiction .",
    "so we see that there are only finitely many elements that have finite conjugacy class . for each such element @xmath8 , it is easy to see that the map @xmath6 defines a bounded linear functional @xmath177 .",
    "any linear combination of these finitely many traces is also a bounded trace . to do this",
    ", we will use the fact that word hyperbolic groups have property rd :    given such a length function on a group , there is a norm @xmath27 on @xmath28 given by @xmath29 let @xmath30 denote the completion of @xmath28 with respect to this norm .",
    "then we say @xmath0 has rapid decay property , or property rd if for some @xmath31 , there is a length function on it and a constant @xmath32 such that @xmath33    it was shown in @xcite that all hyperbolic groups have property rd .",
    "now , we will apply lemma 2.8 in @xcite , which states the following :    let @xmath0 be a group with property rd and @xmath44 be an element whose conjugacy class grows faster than polynomially .",
    "then all traces @xmath178 vanish on @xmath8 .",
    "in our case , word - hyperbolic groups have property rd , so applying theorem [ exp conj class ] , we have that all traces",
    "@xmath178 vanish on all elements with infinite conjugacy class , and they must be linear combinations of the above traces , as desired .    in particular , this gives another proof of de la harpe s result regarding traces on torsion - free non - elementary word - hyperbolic groups , which can be found in @xcite :    let @xmath0 be a torsion - free non - elementary word - hyperbolic group .",
    "then there is only one trace @xmath15 , up to scalar multiples .",
    "theorem [ all traces ] also implies that every hyperbolic group can be written as an extension of a hyperbolic group with unique trace by a finite group , namely :    let @xmath0 be a hyperbolic group .",
    "then it has a finite normal subgroup @xmath179 such that @xmath180 is a hyperbolic group with unique trace , up to scalar multiples .",

    "we claim that @xmath179 is a subgroup .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath179 is closed under inversion , so we want that if @xmath182 then @xmath183 . for an element @xmath44 ,",
    "let @xmath184 be the subgroup consisting of elements that commute with @xmath8 .",
    "then , note that @xmath185 if and only if @xmath176 has finite index as a subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , it suffices to show that if @xmath186 and @xmath187 have finite index , then @xmath188 does also .",

    "there is a natural injection @xmath192 .",

    ", we have that @xmath179 is a subgroup of @xmath0 . as we showed in the proof of theorem",
    "[ all traces ] , @xmath179 is finite . also , it is easy to see that @xmath179 is closed under conjugation . thus , @xmath179 is a finite normal subgroup .",
    "note that @xmath180 is hyperbolic because hyperbolicity is preserved under quasi - isometries , and it is easy to see that the map @xmath197 is a quasi isometry .",
    "thus , @xmath180 is hyperbolic .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath180 has unique trace @xmath198 .",
    "such a trace @xmath199 induces a trace @xmath177 , because @xmath179 is a finite normal subgroup . by theorem [ all traces ] , the trace @xmath177 vanishes on all elements outside of @xmath179 , so the map @xmath200 vanishes on all elements except the identity , as desired .",
