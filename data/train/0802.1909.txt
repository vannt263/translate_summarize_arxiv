    "for more than thirty years the standard model has provided the most accurate theoretical description of particle physics and , at present , there is little direct experimental evidence to suggest that this model should be replaced with a new theory .",
    "but , despite being experimentally sound , it is widely acknowledged that the model is theoretically unsatisfactory in a number of areas @xcite . for instance , a large amount of fine - tuning is required to stabilize the higgs mass at the electroweak scale when the cut - off is taken to be a high energy scale such as the planck scale .",
    "there is also a lack of explanation for the observed structure of the quark and lepton masses and ckm matrix elements , no explanation for the observed small neutrino masses and bi - large mixing angles , and , perhaps most importantly , the standard model is incompatible with general relativity , our most accurate theory of gravity .    the most popular solution to the fine - tuning problem of the higgs mass is to treat the standard model as a low energy effective field theory approximation to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "this can also potentially explain what dark matter consists of and implies that there is unification of the standard model forces within the framework of a supersymmetric grand unified theory ( susy gut ) at around @xmath3 gev .",
    "however , the mssm does not entirely free the standard model of problems with the higgs mass since it introduces the @xmath4-problem @xcite ( the unexplained origin of the susy higgs - higgsino mass parameter with a tev scale value ) and , because no superpartners have been experimentally observed so far , a small fine - tuning problem",
    ". another related problem of susy guts is the question of how to split the colour triplet higgs apart from their higgs doublet partners , giving gut scale masses to the former and weak scale masses to the latter , while also satisfying the colour - triplet induced proton decay experimental bounds .",
    "an elegant solution to the @xmath4-problem is to extend the particle content of the mssm by introducing a standard model singlet @xmath5 that couples to the higgs doublets such that its dynamically generated vacuum expectation value ( vev ) provides an effective tev scale @xmath4-term that is related to the breaking of supersymmetry @xcite . in such theories",
    "there is also some advantage to be gained by having an additional low energy abelian gauge group factor @xmath6 . without a @xmath6 gauge group a goldstone boson",
    "would be created by the singlet s vev since the extended mssm superpotential has an associated global @xmath7 symmetry @xcite .",
    "alternative ways to resolve the would - be goldstone boson problem certainly exist , namely the global @xmath7 symmetry can be explicitly broken in some way e.g. by adding an @xmath8 term to the superpotential , as in the next - to(n)mssm @xcite .",
    "however , such approaches are always accompanied by additional problems , for example , the @xmath8 term introduces dangerous domain walls when a @xmath9 discrete symmetry associated with the nmssm superpotential is broken . by contrast",
    "the @xmath6 gauge group eats the goldstone boson , resulting in an observable massive @xmath10 .",
    "standard model ( sm ) singlets and @xmath6 gauge groups that can resolve the @xmath4-problem of the mssm as discussed above turn out to be naturally contained within susy guts based on an @xmath1 gauge group . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on @xmath6 subgroups of @xmath1 for which the right - handed neutrinos are singlets so that a conventional see - saw mechanism can be used .",
    "@xmath1 models that contain a @xmath6 for which the right - handed neutrinos are singlets have been collectively called exceptional supersymmetric standard models .",
    "here we study two such models : the me@xmath2ssm ( minimal exceptional supersymmetric standard model ) @xcite and the usual e@xmath2ssm @xcite .",
    "note that in both versions of the model the tev scale spectrum involves the matter content of three complete @xmath11 supermultiplets of @xmath1 in order to cancel all the gauge anomalies family by family .",
    "this means that , compared to the mssm , there are an additional three families of extra states with the quantum numbers of three @xmath12 representations of @xmath13 at the tev scale",
    ". these states will obviously ameliorate the little fine - tuning of the mssm , since they increase the lightest higgs mass considerably @xcite .    in the usual e@xmath2ssm @xcite the @xmath6 gauge group ,",
    "called @xmath14 , is a combination of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 abelian subgroups of @xmath1 defined by @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the combination of the groups is chosen so that the right - handed neutrinos do not transform under @xmath14 . to cancel gauge anomalies for this group , three copies of a @xmath11 supermultiplet of @xmath1 survive to low energies in the model .",
    "on top of this , two additional electroweak doublets ( which have opposite @xmath14 charges ) are added at the tev scale so that unification of the standard model gauge coupling constants occurs at the gut scale . since the colour triplets are light in the e@xmath2ssm , the proton decay operators must either be forbidden or highly suppressed .",
    "the former option is achieved using an exact @xmath19 or @xmath20 symmetry under which the colour triplets are leptoquarks or diquarks @xcite .",
    "such symmetries do not commute with the @xmath1 ( or its @xmath13 or pati - salam subgroups ) and so the model is written in terms of its standard model representation .",
    "multiplets so that the @xmath19 or @xmath20 symmetries do commute with @xmath1 @xcite . ]",
    "the me@xmath2ssm is a ` minimal ' version of the @xmath1ssm .",
    "this refers to the fact that the me@xmath2ssm does not contain the two additional electroweak doublets required for unification of the gauge coupling constants at the gut scale , which can reintroduce a @xmath21-problem analogous to the original @xmath4-problem @xcite .",
    "gauge coupling unification is instead predicted to occur close to the planck scale in the me@xmath2ssm using an intermediate pati - salam symmetry that is broken to the standard model at the conventional gut scale .",
    "the @xmath6 group of the me@xmath2ssm , denoted by @xmath22 , is not the same as the @xmath14 but still allows for a conventional see - saw mechanism since the right - handed neutrinos remain neutral under it . unlike the e@xmath2ssm ,",
    "the proton decay operators are highly suppressed rather than forbidden . since the @xmath1 symmetry is predicted to reside at the scale at which quantum gravity effects should dominate , the model is formulated in terms of the intermediate pati - salam and @xmath15 gauge groups .    in this paper",
    "we shall consider the e@xmath2ssm as being broken via the pati - salam chain as in the me@xmath2ssm . in this case",
    "the only difference between the two models is that the e@xmath2ssm involves an additional two low energy electroweak doublets , leading to unification at the gut scale . since , in the case of such an e@xmath2ssm , the pati - salam gauge group does not survive for very long before it is broken , the phenomenology of the two alternative breaking chains for the e@xmath2ssm ( pati - salam or @xmath13 ) is very similar , differing only by the discussion of triplet decay and proton decay . for the e@xmath2ssm as broken via the pati - salam chain , the triplet decay and proton decay discussion is the same as in the me@xmath2ssm . when the @xmath23 and @xmath24 pati - salam gauge coupling constants are equal to each other ( as in the pati - salam version of the e@xmath2ssm ) then the charge of the @xmath22 group becomes equivalent to the charge of the @xmath14 group ( see @xcite for a detailed explanation of this ) .    despite their obvious attractions ,",
    "as outlined above , none of the e@xmath2ssm models so far proposed addresses the flavour problem , i.e. provides an explanation for the structure of quark and lepton masses and mixing angles . in the past decade , the flavour problem has been enriched by the discovery of neutrino mass and mixing , leading to an explosion of interest in this area @xcite .",
    "a common approach is to suppose that the quarks and leptons are described by some family symmetry which is spontaneously broken at a high energy scale @xcite .",
    "in particular , the approximately tri - bimaximal nature of lepton mixing provides a renewed motivation for idea the yukawa couplings are controlled by a spontaneously broken non - abelian family symmetry which spans all three families , for example @xmath25 @xcite , @xmath26 @xcite , or one of their discrete subgroups @xcite . in such models tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing arises from a combination of vacuum alignment and ( constrained ) sequential dominance @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such family symmetries provide a solution to the susy flavour and cp problems @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to extend the above classes of e@xmath2ssm models to include a discrete non - abelian family symmetry as a step towards solving the flavour problem in these models . in particular",
    ", we shall use the @xmath0 family symmetry introduced in @xcite ( @xmath0 is a discrete non - abelian subgroup of @xmath25 ) .",
    "this is convenient since the @xmath0 family symmetry model in @xcite and the me@xmath2ssm in @xcite are both based on a high - energy pati - salam symmetry .",
    "following this approach we can also construct models based on the e@xmath2ssm with a @xmath0 family symmetry which are broken through the pati - salam chain , as discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "the detailed strategy we shall pursue is as follows .",
    "we will introduce the @xmath0 family symmetry from @xcite to the intermediate pati - salam symmetry of the me@xmath2ssm or e@xmath2ssm to build a model based on a @xmath27 gauge group where @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting model can explain the observed mixing angles and mass spectrum of the quarks and leptons , provide a tri - bimaximal mixing for the neutrinos , solve the @xmath4-problem and small fine - tuning problem , and does not involve doublet - triplet splitting .",
    "a novel feature of the me@xmath2ssm and the pati - salam formulation of the e@xmath2ssm is that proton decay is suppressed in a new way by the assumed @xmath0 family symmetry and an @xmath1 singlet .",
    "we also show how the @xmath21-problem can be solved in the e@xmath2ssm using the @xmath1 singlet that gets an intermediate vev and suppresses proton decay .",
    "the layout of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we propose a model based on the pati - salam gauge groups of the me@xmath2ssm or e@xmath2ssm and the @xmath0 family symmetry model . in section 3",
    "we discuss gauge coupling unification at the gut scale in the e@xmath2ssm or at the string scale in the me@xmath2ssm .",
    "section 4 summarizes our results .",
    "in this section we introduce a @xmath0 family symmetry into the me@xmath2ssm or e@xmath2ssm broken via the pati - salam chain .",
    "the e@xmath2ssm model with @xmath0 family symmetry has gauge coupling unification at the gut scale , rather than the string scale .",
    "the resulting models are very powerful since they can address the observed mixing angles and mass spectrum of the quarks and leptons , including the tri - bimaximal mixing for the neutrinos , the @xmath4-problem and the little fine - tuning problem of the mssm .",
    "we also show how the model solves the problem of rapid proton decay ( and colour triplet decay ) without introducing doublet - triplet splitting .    in the me@xmath2ssm or e@xmath2ssm the standard model quarks and",
    "leptons come from three copies of the fundamental @xmath1 multiplet of dimension @xmath11 .",
    "each @xmath11 multiplet breaks into the following pati - salam representations : @xmath29 where @xmath30 contain one generation of the leptons and quarks ( and a charge conjugated neutrino ) , @xmath31 can contain the mssm higgs bosons , @xmath32 is often called a colour triplet higgs since it transforms as a colour triplet , and @xmath5 is a singlet of the standard model .",
    "the explicit pati - salam representations of these states are listed in table 1 . following the me@xmath2ssm and e@xmath2ssm",
    "we take the third copy of the @xmath11 multiplets to contain the mssm higgs bosons , which we denote by @xmath33 . in the @xmath0 family symmetry model in @xcite the three generations of the leptons and quarks @xmath34 , @xmath35 transform as triplets under the @xmath0 group , and the mssm higgs bosons @xmath33 transform as a singlet .",
    "the rest of the me@xmath2ssm and e@xmath2ssm states from the three @xmath11 multiplets are not considered in the family symmetry model . in sections 2.2 to 2.5",
    "we explain the chosen @xmath0 assignments for these me@xmath2ssm or e@xmath2ssm states , which are summarized by table  1 .",
    "the only distinction between the me@xmath2ssm and e@xmath2ssm is that the latter involves an additional pair of electroweak doublets @xmath36 in order to achieve unification at the gut scale .",
    "we now briefly explain the approach to understanding yukawa hierarchies and neutrino tri - bimaximal ( tb ) mixing via broken family symmetry , vacuum alignment and constrained sequential dominance ( csd ) ( for more details see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the family symmetry is broken by extra higgs scalars called flavons , often denoted by @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the flavons typically couple to the sm matter fermions via heavy messenger fields giving rise ( upon integrating out the messenger sector ) to effective yukawa operators proportional to powers of the flavon fields suppressed by powers of the messenger mass @xmath39 .",
    "the effective yukawa couplings are then expressed in terms of ratios of flavon vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath40 to these messenger mass scales @xmath39 , which defines a set of expansion parameters @xmath41 .",
    "if the neutrino masses are assumed to originate from the seesaw mechanism , the tb mixing pattern receives a natural explanation by means of the so - called constrained sequential dominance mechanism .",
    "the basic idea is that only one right - handed ( rh ) neutrino contributes dominantly to the atmospheric neutrino mass and thus the atmospheric mixing angle corresponds to a simple ratio of yukawa couplings of just the dominant rh neutrino .",
    "one of the subdominant rh neutrinos is then assumed to govern the solar neutrino mass , in which case the solar mixing angle corresponds to another simple ratio of yukawa couplings associated to this rh state .",
    "the tb mixing pattern can then be implemented by means of simple constraints on the yukawa couplings . since these emerge from flavon vevs , csd",
    "is then achieved from a proper vacuum alignment of flavons in the family space , for example @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , up to phases .",
    ".this table lists all the particles ( excluding the messengers ) contained in the me@xmath2ssm and e@xmath2ssm with a @xmath0 family symmetry model where the @xmath1 symmetry is broken via the pati - salam chain .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath45 representations are given for each particle , as well as the assignments for the additional constraining symmetries @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath47 and @xmath48 particles are expected to come from three copies of a @xmath11 multiplet of a broken @xmath1 symmetry , the @xmath49 are considered to be remnants of @xmath50 @xmath1 states , the @xmath51 is expected to come from a @xmath52 multiplet of @xmath1 or as a composite of additional @xmath53 states , and , with the exception of @xmath54 , the flavons are singlets of @xmath1 .",
    "the three copies of the @xmath11 are the same as those in the me@xmath2ssm and e@xmath2ssm .",
    "the flavons , @xmath51 and @xmath55 are the same as the equivalent particles in @xcite , and the @xmath56 , @xmath39 and @xmath57 particles are similar to the equivalent states in the me@xmath2ssm . in the e@xmath2ssm family symmetry model",
    "there are also two additional electroweak doublets @xmath58 and @xmath59 which cause the gauge coupling constants to unify at the gut scale and have @xmath15 charges of @xmath60 where @xmath61 is some real number .",

    "e@xmath2ssm models considered here the @xmath34 and @xmath35 transform as @xmath0 triplets and @xmath33 transforms as a singlet .",
    "this forbids the superpotential term @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are theoretically undetermined yukawa coefficients .",
    "instead higher order terms are allowed that effectively generate the standard model yukawa interactions but with the desired yukawa coefficients dynamically generated to give the observed ckm matrix and quark and lepton masses .",
    "this is achieved by introducing new particles to the theory that couple to the fermions and quarks via their @xmath0 components and break the family symmetry to nothing .",

    "the @xmath51 in eq.[eq : yh45 ] and eq.[eq : yh452 ] is an @xmath0 singlet that transforms as @xmath82 under the @xmath45 symmetry .",
    "this particle gets a vev in the hypercharge direction generating the georgi - jarlskog factor for eq.[eq : yh45 ] @xcite .",
    "this sets @xmath83 at the family symmetry breaking scale , which , after radiative corrections from the grand unified scale in an mssm inspired gut , agrees well with experimental data .",
    "since right - handed neutrinos have zero hypercharge , the @xmath51 also suppresses the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "this is necessary for tri - bimaximal mixing to come from the @xmath0 family symmetry @xcite .",
    "the high order superpotential terms given by eq.[eq : yfirst]-[eq : ylast ] are assumed to come from renormalizable , high - energy interactions involving heavy vector - like particles that transform in the same way as the quark and lepton fields under the @xmath45 symmetry .",
    "such particles , called messengers , are integrated out of the high energy theory to generate the above suppressed superpotential terms . to distinguish the yukawa matrices for the up and down quarks we require that the @xmath23 messengers dominate over the @xmath84 messengers and , for the correct up and down yukawa matrices",
    ", we require that the up and down right - handed messengers have mass @xmath85 and @xmath86 related by @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved within the framework of wilson - line breaking of @xmath23 at some compactification scale @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath81 to denote the right - handed messenger scale , which could be @xmath85 or @xmath86 depending on the interactions involved .",

    "the @xmath0 components that get vevs are given by the flavons subscripts .",
    "putting these vevs into eq.[eq : yfirst]-[eq : y3rd ] generates the following leading order up and down quark yukawa matrices @xcite :    @xmath94    if @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , then , after radiative corrections from a high energy scale , the above matrices ( and corresponding lepton matrices ) are able to generate quark and lepton masses and ckm values that are in good agreement with the observed values once the corrections from the higher order operators",
    "eq.[eq : yh452 ] and eq.[eq : ylast ] are included @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that in both the me@xmath2ssm and e@xmath2ssm with @xmath0 family symmetry models the renormalization group equations ( rges ) will be different from those in the mssm since there are three copies of a supersymmetric @xmath1 @xmath11 multiplet below the conventional gut scale ( and two additional electroweak doublets in the e@xmath2ssm model ) rather than just the mssm particle spectrum .",
    "this is illustrated by figure 1 for the me@xmath2ssm with @xmath0 family symmetry model .",
    "the yukawa terms in the @xmath0 model @xcite were assumed to be formulated at the gut scale and , after running the assumed mssm from the gut scale to the electroweak scale , the results agree with the observed quark and lepton mixing angles and masses . in the me@xmath2ssm and e@xmath2ssm with @xmath0 family symmetry models",
    "the running effects will clearly be different , but we do not expect the main features of the low energy spectrum to be qualitatively very different .      in the me@xmath2ssm and e@xmath2ssm models considered here the pati - salam symmetry is broken to the standard model by particles that transform as @xmath98 under @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath99 particle , denoted by @xmath55 , once it develops its gut scale vev , gives mass to the right - handed neutrinos using planck suppressed operators @xmath100 .",
    "this non - renormalizable term , together with the yukawa interaction involving the neutrinos , can explain the small mass scale of the neutrinos but not the observed hierarchical structure of neutrino masses and large mixing angles without setting the couplings @xmath101 by hand .",
    "in the @xmath0 family symmetry model the particles that give mass to the right - handed neutrinos also transform as @xmath102 under the pati - salam gauge group but are taken to transform as anti - triplets under @xmath0 . with this @xmath0 assignment , the particles can dynamically generate the observed hierarchical structure of neutrino masses and a tri - bimaximal mixing .",
    "following the @xmath0 family symmetry model , we therefore take the @xmath55 particle to transform as an anti - triplet of @xmath0 .",
    "the majorana interactions are then given by @xcite :    @xmath103    @xmath104    @xmath105 together with the neutrino yukawa matrix generated by eq.[eq : yfirst]-[eq : ylast ] , the above interactions produce a @xmath106 matrix with tri - bimaximal mixing and a hierarchical structure of neutrino masses in agreement with the observed values @xcite .",
    "how this happens is discussed in @xcite and references therein , and the details of this are identical for the present model .",
    "taking @xmath107 to transform as a singlet under @xmath0 allows the superpotential term @xmath108 .",
    "this term is also allowed in the me@xmath2ssm and e@xmath2ssm .",
    "if @xmath107 obtains a vacuum expectation value at the tev scale , @xmath108 will become an effective @xmath4-term of the mssm with the desired value of @xmath4 for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the @xmath107 vev is expected to depend on the breaking of susy @xcite , thus resolving the @xmath4-problem of the mssm .",
    "in addition to solving the @xmath4-problem of the mssm , this model will also resolve the little fine - tuning problem of the mssm .",
    "this is because there are extra particles below the conventional gut scale of @xmath3 gev that are not contained in the mssm .",
    "these extra particles are from the three copies of the @xmath11 @xmath1 multiplet and form two copies of a @xmath109 of the @xmath13 subgroup of @xmath1 , and one colour triplet higgs particle . due to renormalization group effects",
    ", the extra states increase the value of the yukawa coupling constant for @xmath108 at low energies , and hence increase the mass of the lightest cp even higgs boson @xcite .",
    "since @xmath107 is assumed to get a vev at the tev scale , this suggests that the @xmath110 particles from the three copies of the @xmath11 multiplet should transform as @xmath0 singlets , so they may all acquire tev scale masses .",
    "if instead we assumed them to be @xmath0 triplets then at least one of their masses would be expected to be lower than the electroweak symmetry breaking scale , in violation of the direct experimental limits .",
    "this is because we would expect the effective couplings @xmath111 , with @xmath107 obtaining a vev at the tev scale , to have a strongly hierarchical mass structure , as in the case of ordinary quarks , with at least the first generation , @xmath112 , possibly having a mass lower the electroweak breaking scale . instead , with @xmath110 as @xmath0 singlets",
    ", they will all obtain tev scale masses from the ( unsuppressed ) superpotential terms @xmath111 .",

    "the pati - salam @xmath110 particles , which we shall refer to as colour triplet higgs , decompose to @xmath118 and @xmath119 multiplets of the standard model and will cause proton decay unless the effective interactions @xmath120 or @xmath121 , which are allowed by the @xmath1 superpotential @xmath122 , are heavily suppressed or forbidden @xcite .",
    "these operators are always present in guts and susy guts , see raby in @xcite . however , in the exact @xmath0 symmetry limit , operators of the form @xmath123 and @xmath124 are forbidden , since @xmath30 are family triplets while @xmath32 are family singlets .",
    "once the @xmath0 family symmetry is broken however , proton decay operators will reappear suppressed by flavon and other vevs , and it becomes a quantitative question whether these operators are sufficiently suppressed . with the @xmath117 and @xmath0 symmetries chosen as in table 1 ,",
    "the only way to generate these proton - decay inducing terms is from higher order terms involving flavons ( to repair the @xmath0 symmetry ) , and the @xmath1 singlet @xmath57 ( to repair the @xmath117 symmetry ) .",

    "@xmath129    @xmath130    these operators are suppressed by the square of a string scale @xmath66 , which we take to be of order @xmath131 gev .",
    "we assume that this type of suppression can be achieved due to the fact that the messengers that couple the @xmath57 particle to the @xmath132 superpotential term are different to the messengers that couple the flavons and @xmath55 to the quarks and leptons in the yukawa and majorana interactions of sections 2.1 and 2.2 .",
    "we assume that the former messengers reside at the unification scale which we take to be a string scale @xmath133 gev , see section 3.2 for further discussion .",
    "the effective terms @xmath134 are then suppressed by a factor of about @xmath135 , which , for @xmath97 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 gev , and @xmath133 gev , is around @xmath138 .",
    "this level of suppression should be just sufficient to prevent proton decay from being observable in present experiments if the colour triplets have mass greater than about @xmath139 tev @xcite . rather than @xmath138 .",
    "the suppression of @xmath140 used in @xcite only prevents proton decay if the grand unified coupling constant for the interactions between the colour triplets and the up and down quarks was of the same order of magnitude as the up and down yukawa coupling constant in the higgs sector .",
    "this is not possible in the me@xmath2ssm with family symmetry model however since the up and down yukawa coupling constants are generated by the flavon structure .",
    "we therefore require a suppression of @xmath141 for the appropriate interactions . ]",
    "we emphasize that the @xmath138 level of suppression is only a rough order of magnitude calculation and can be determined from a number of sources , for example , the @xmath142 proton decay operators in r - parity violating models @xcite , and the @xmath142 proton decay operators in grand unified theories with doublet - triplet splitting @xcite .",
    "the present experimental limit on the @xmath143 proton decay operator @xmath144 is @xmath145 yrs @xcite .    to prevent the colour triplets from decaying with a lifetime smaller than 0.1 s the interactions @xmath146",
    "should be suppressed by no more than roughly @xmath138 or @xmath147 ( using order of magnitude calculations from @xcite ) . a lifetime longer than about 0.1s for the colour triplets could cause problems for nucleosynthesis .",
    "the amount of yukawa suppression for these interactions is thus uniquely set to be about @xmath138 with the upper limit set by the proton decay and the lower limit set by colour triplet decay requirements .",
    "this small allowed window of couplings warrants a more detailed analysis of both proton decay and triplet decay , which we hope will be performed in the future , since it will lead to testable predictions for proton decay .",
    "the long lived tev scale colour triplet states , which will be quasi - stable at colliders , lead to striking signatures at the lhc @xcite .    the above solution to triplet",
    "- higgs - induced proton decay is very different from the solution used in conventional susy guts .",
    "generically the solution is to make @xmath110 very heavy ( usually above the gut scale ) using doublet - triplet splitting .",
    "however , no such doublet - triplet splitting is allowed in this theory since gauge anomalies for the low energy @xmath22 gauge group would be created @xcite , and instead the proton decay is suppressed by the symmetries of the model ( in particular the @xmath0 family symmetry ) .",
    "not all the components of @xmath55 and @xmath56 obtain mass by absorbing the broken pati - salam gauge bosons when they acquire vacuum expectation values in the right - handed neutrino direction . to give the rest of @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( and @xmath149 and @xmath150 from the @xmath151 multiplets @xmath152 and @xmath153 ) mass , we have included a singlet @xmath39 in table  1 .",
    "this singlet is assumed to get a gut scale vev , giving mass to @xmath49 from the superpotential term @xmath154 . since @xmath39 carries a @xmath63 charge of @xmath155 , its vev breaks @xmath63 to an r - parity .",
    "this r - parity is the same as that in the me@xmath2ssm , which is a generalization of r - parity in the mssm .",
    "this r - parity keeps the lsp stable , thus providing a dark matter candidate .      in the e@xmath2ssm , to prevent the two additional electroweak doublets @xmath58 and @xmath59 from introducing gauge anomalies for the @xmath14 gauge group , they are assumed have opposite @xmath14 charges .",
    "these particles effectively reintroduce a @xmath21-problem since there is no simple mechanism that explains why these particles have low energy masses . here",
    "we give the particles mass by assuming that the @xmath1 singlet @xmath57 couples to the @xmath58 and @xmath59 through the non - renormalizable term @xmath156 and obtains a vacuum expectation value at @xmath157 gev .",
    "this gives @xmath58 and @xmath59 the correct scale of mass for gauge coupling unification to occur at the gut scale ( see the third reference in @xcite ) .",
    "the way in which @xmath58 and @xmath59 transform under the pati - salam , @xmath15 , and other symmetries is presented in table 1 , which contains the total particle spectrum of the e@xmath2ssm ( and me@xmath2ssm ) with @xmath0 family symmetry . and @xmath59",
    "are chosen to transform as @xmath158 and @xmath159 pati - salam representations respectively where @xmath61 is a real number .",
    "such multiplets can not be derived from @xmath1 multiplets . ]",
    "in this subsection we briefly discuss the pattern of symmetry breaking for the e@xmath2ssm with a @xmath0 family symmetry model . adding the extra electroweak states @xmath58 and @xmath59 at the tev scale to the three copies of a @xmath11",
    "causes the standard model gauge coupling constants to unify at the conventional gut scale but with a higher value than the mssm prediction for the unification gauge coupling constant ( see the third reference of @xcite ) .",
    "this of course requires that the @xmath23 and @xmath24 subgroups of the @xmath1 symmetry be broken at the same scale ( the gut scale ) .",
    "however , as discussed further in the following section ( 3.2 ) , we expect the @xmath23 and @xmath24 groups to be broken by separate mechanisms so that the @xmath84 messengers and up and down @xmath23 messengers have different masses but the quark and lepton components of the @xmath24 messengers have the same masses , as required for section 2.1 . to achieve this we assume that , at the gut scale , the vev of the @xmath160 multiplets breaks @xmath24 to @xmath161 , and the @xmath23 is broken to @xmath162 by a wilson - line @xcite .",
    "symmetry , the vev of the @xmath148 multiplets will also mix the @xmath163 , @xmath162 and @xmath15 groups to create @xmath164 and the @xmath14 group of the e@xmath2ssm .",
    "the @xmath14 group of the e@xmath2ssm is generated , rather than the @xmath22 group of the me@xmath2ssm , because the gauge coupling constants of the pati - salam ( and @xmath15 ) symmetries are equal at the symmetry breaking scale @xcite .",
    "] this will give the up @xmath23 messengers masses smaller than the gut scale .",
    "therefore , to compensate for the effect on the running of the standard model gauge coupling constants caused by the up @xmath23 messengers ( which would upset unification ) , we would require additional messengers below the gut scale that , together with the up @xmath23 messengers , form a _",
    "complete _ @xmath165 multiplet of @xmath13 .",
    "the messengers below the gut scale would increase the mssm prediction for the value of the unification gauge coupling constant but keep the unification scale as the conventional gut scale .",
    "of course too many messengers , and too small messenger masses , would cause the standard model gauge coupling constants to blow up before they unify . here",
    "we simply assume that the minimal number of messengers required to generate the correct quark and lepton masses and mixing angles does not prevent the unification of the standard model gauge coupling constants at the gut scale .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss the pattern of symmetry breaking for the me@xmath2ssm with a @xmath0 family symmetry model and , using two simple toy models , demonstrate that gauge coupling unification at the string scale could be possible . in the me@xmath2ssm the @xmath1 symmetry is assumed to be broken at the planck scale to a left - right symmetric pati - salam gauge group @xmath166 ( a maximal subgroup of @xmath151 ) and an abelian gauge group @xmath15 .",
    "the left - right symmetric gauge group is then broken to the standard model gauge group with an additional abelian gauge group @xmath22 , which is a combination of the charge of the @xmath15 group , the diagonal generator @xmath167 of the @xmath23 group , and the diagonal generator associated with the @xmath168 subgroup of @xmath24 defined by @xmath169 .",
    "this breaking is achieved by the me@xmath2ssm equivalent to the @xmath148 particles from gaining vevs in the right - handed neutrino directions . at the scale of this symmetry breaking the gauge couplings of the abelian groups @xmath168 , @xmath170 and @xmath164 must satisfy the following equation @xcite :    @xmath171    for the me@xmath2ssm this is equivalent to @xcite :    @xmath172    using @xmath173 and @xmath174 from the left - right symmetry , the above equation can be written solely in terms of standard model gauge coupling constants .",
    "the scale of the pati - salam symmetry is therefore determined by running the standard model gauge couplings up until they satisfy this boundary equation . with three copies of a @xmath11 multiplet at low energies",
    "this scale is found to be @xmath175 gev at the two - loop order @xcite .",
    "when we include the @xmath0 family symmetry to the me@xmath2ssm , the pattern of symmetry breaking is likely to change from the above discussion .",
    "this is because the @xmath23 and @xmath24 groups must be broken by separate mechanisms so that the @xmath84 messengers and up and down @xmath23 messengers have different masses but the quark and lepton components of the @xmath24 messengers have the same masses , as required for section 2.1 . to achieve this",
    "we assume that the vev of the @xmath148 multiplets breaks @xmath24 to @xmath176 , and that @xmath23 is broken to @xmath162 by a wilson - line at some compactification scale @xcite . to break @xmath24 to @xmath177 .",
    "this depends on whether the vev of @xmath51 is chosen to be at a greater or smaller energy scale than the @xmath148 vev . in @xcite and ( the second reference in ) @xcite , for example",
    ", the @xmath51 vev is taken to be of order @xmath178 and @xmath179 respectively . ] to prevent the messengers from altering the running of the gauge couplings of the me@xmath2ssm to a large degree , we expect that @xmath86 should be of order or greater than the @xmath24 breaking scale .",
    "it then follows that , to generate @xmath180 , the compactification scale at which @xmath23 is broken to @xmath162 should be around three times greater than @xmath86 .    the pattern of symmetry breaking in this case",
    "is thus expected to proceed as follows : the @xmath23 group is broken to @xmath162 at a compactification scale @xmath68 , which , along with the @xmath181 symmetry , is broken at a lower scale to @xmath182 by the @xmath148 particles .",
    "we also expect the left - right discrete symmetry to be broken since the left - handed messengers are heavier than and right - handed messengers .",
    "in realistic models of the me@xmath2ssm with @xmath0 family symmetry , we therefore do not expect the scale of @xmath45 symmetry breaking to be determined uniquely using eq.[eq : alphay ] since there is no longer a symmetry that sets @xmath183 equal to @xmath184 at this scale .",
    "the @xmath148 particles also transform under the @xmath0 family symmetry and get vevs in the third component so that they break the @xmath0 symmetry at the same scale as the @xmath185 symmetry .",
    "the remaining part of the family symmetry , which is a subgroup of @xmath0 , will be broken by the vev of the @xmath186 flavons at the scale @xmath92 where the right - handed messengers mass @xmath86 should be above the @xmath0 symmetry breaking scale otherwise wavefunction insertions of the invariant operator @xmath187 on a third family propagator can spoil the perturbative expansion if @xmath188 @xcite .",
    "ssm with @xmath0 family symmetry .",
    "it demonstrates that unification can be possible using a basic qft description although we expect additional effects such as extra dimensions to change the running of the gauge couplings at higher energies and therefore to change the scale of unification .",
    "the two models are described in detail in section 3.2 .",
    "the left panel is for a model with left - right symmetric intermediate @xmath45 symmetry , whereas the right panel is for a more realistic non - symmetric @xmath45 symmetry .",

    "this is mainly due to the number of additional particles ( messengers ) to the me@xmath2ssm states at and above the @xmath192 symmetry scale , which are required for the @xmath0 family symmetry to accurately describe the observed quark and fermion masses and mixing angles .",
    "these extra states cause the gauge coupling constants to increase rapidly above the @xmath192 symmetry breaking scale , bringing forward the unification scale .",
    "other modifications to the @xmath1 symmetry breaking scale in the me@xmath2ssm will come from extra dimensions above the compactification scale , the running of the gauge coupling constant for the abelian @xmath162 group , and the breaking of the left - right discrete symmetry at the compactification scale .",
    "unification of the gauge coupling constants may in fact no longer be possible when all of these changes from the me@xmath2ssm are calculated , but in figure 1 we demonstrate that gauge coupling unification still occurs for two simple toy models of the me@xmath2ssm with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we make the approximation that the compactification scale is equal to the @xmath192 symmetry breaking scale .",
    "both toy models therefore have an intermediate @xmath45 symmetry as in the me@xmath2ssm .",
    "however , for the toy model in the right panel of figure 1 , we assume that the left - right discrete symmetry is broken at the unification scale due to the different masses for the left - handed and right - handed messengers .",
    "furthermore , we also neglect any effects from extra dimensions above the compactification scale . in both panels of figure 1",
    "we assume that three copies of an @xmath1 @xmath11 multiplet , which contain all the mssm states as well as new ( non - mssm ) states , have mass at low energies and , following the me@xmath2ssm , we take effective mssm and non - mssm thresholds of @xmath193 gev and @xmath139 tev respectively .    at the @xmath27 symmetry",
    "breaking scale , we also assume additional particles that break the symmetry and play a part in the @xmath0 family symmetry s description of quark and lepton masses . in the left panel",
    "we take these extra particles to consist of all the @xmath45 states from five copies of @xmath53 multiplets , except for the @xmath194 states which we assume have mass at the unification scale , as well as all the flavons given in table 1 and a left - handed partner for @xmath54 .",
    "the additional @xmath53 states contain the @xmath195 particles that break the @xmath196 symmetry and provide the majorana interactions , the @xmath197 particles that give the @xmath51 as a composite , and messengers that also transform as a @xmath197 of @xmath151 .",
    "we assume that @xmath51 is a composite of a @xmath197 state since a fundamental @xmath51 particle ( and its left - handed partner ) would affect the running of the @xmath24 gauge couplings by an amount that causes it to blow up before any unification of gauge couplings is possible , unless a large number of @xmath198 extra states are added to compensate for this .",
    "we would also need to explain why the rest of the @xmath52 @xmath1 multiplet , that contains the @xmath51 , have larger mass . on top of the five copies of the @xmath53 multiplets",
    "we also add additional higgs messengers that transform as a triplet and an anti - triplet of the @xmath0 family symmetry .",
    "these are required for unification of the gauge coupling constants .",
    "for the right panel we include the same states as the left panel but without the left - handed messengers as these are expected to get much larger masses than their right - handed components .",
    "the scales of unification and @xmath45 symmetry breaking are at @xmath189 , @xmath190 gev and @xmath175 , @xmath191 gev for the left , right panel respectively .",
    "note that the @xmath45 symmetry breaking scales are close to the grand unification scale in conventional guts , we thus denote the scale by @xmath67 .",
    "we emphasize that these toy models do not represent accurate predictions for the running of the gauge coupling constants of the me@xmath2ssm with @xmath0 family symmetry and are only used to demonstrate that , with the inclusion of the @xmath0 messenger states to the me@xmath2ssm , gauge coupling unification is still possible but at a scale that is closer to the string scale than the planck scale .",
    "in this paper we have discussed models based on broken @xmath1 gut with a @xmath0 ( a discrete subgroup of @xmath25 ) family symmetry broken close to the gut scale . to provide realistic models we also require additional symmetries , including an r - symmetry which results in a conserved r - parity .",
    "the models combine the me@xmath2ssm and e@xmath2ssm proposed in @xcite with the @xmath0 family symmetry approach of @xcite .",
    "the resulting synthesis is very powerful and predictive , and solves a number of problems facing the mssm , including the little fine - tuning problem , the @xmath4-problem and the flavour problem .",
    "the solution to the @xmath4-problem requires an additional low energy @xmath22 gauge group , under which right - handed neutrinos are neutral , allowing a conventional see - saw mechanism .",
    "the @xmath0 accounts for the quark and lepton masses and mixing angles , with tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing resulting from vacuum alignment and constrained sequential dominance .",
    "note that we have considered both the me@xmath2ssm and e@xmath2ssm formulated in terms of a pati - salam symmetry ( and an abelian gauge group @xmath15 ) yielding the standard model gauge group ( and an abelian gauge group @xmath22 ) below the conventional gut scale . in the case of the e@xmath2ssm the gauge group @xmath22 is identical to @xmath14 of @xcite since the gauge couplings are unified at @xmath67 .",
    "the main phenomenological difference between the e@xmath2ssm discussed here ( broken via the pati - salam chain ) and the e@xmath2ssm discussed in @xcite ( broken via the @xmath13 chain ) arises from the physics of the colour triplet higgs couplings . in the original e@xmath2ssm @xcite ,",
    "exact @xmath199 or @xmath200 symmetries are allowed corresponding to the colour triplet states coupling as diquarks or leptoquarks , effectively preventing proton decay , while allowing rapid colour triplet decay .",
    "however , the pati - salam symmetry assumed here for both the me@xmath2ssm and e@xmath2ssm , prevents the use of the @xmath200 or @xmath199 . instead , in both the me@xmath2ssm and e@xmath2ssm ,",
    "the colour triplet yukawa couplings must be suppressed down to the level of @xmath138 , as required to sufficiently suppress proton decay whilst allowing the states to decay before nucleosynthesis .",
    "this is achieved by the symmetries of the model , with the @xmath0 family symmetry playing an important role in helping to achieve the required degree of suppression .",
