    "in medical research , continuous markers are widely employed in diagnostic tests to distinguish diseased and non - diseased subjects @xcite .",
    "a subject is diagnosed as diseased if the marker value is higher than a given threshold value , and otherwise non - diseased .",
    "the diagnosis accuracy of the marker is usually evaluated through sensitivity and specificity , or the probabilities of a true positive and a true negative for any given threshold value .",
    "in addition , the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve is defined as sensitivity versus 1-specificity over all possible threshold values for the marker @xcite . to summarize the overall property of an roc curve ,",
    "different summarizing indices are proposed , including the youden index @xcite and the area under the roc curve ( auc ; @xcite ) .",
    "the youden index , defined as the maximum vertical distance between the roc curve and the @xmath0 line , is an indicator of how far the curve is from the uninformative test @xcite .",
    "it ranges from 0 for the uninformative test to 1 for an ideal test .",
    "the youden index has been successfully applied in many medical studies to provide an appropriate one - dimensional summary of the test accuracy and determine its associated cut - point ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in literature , various statistical modeling strategies have been proposed to estimate the youden index and its associated cut - point .",
    "one main strategy is to use parametric models ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which assume that the values of the diagnostic marker for the diseased and non - diseased subjects , respectively , follow certain probability distribution . with the parametric probability distributions ,",
    "explicit formulas for the youden index and its associated cut - point can be derived .",
    "another popular strategy uses non - parametric models ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which estimate the conditional distribution of the diagnostic marker for the diseased and non - diseased subjects via non - parametric density estimation techniques .",
    "fluss et al .",
    "@xcite conducted numerical comparisons among a number of popular estimation methods , and suggested that the kernel density estimation is generally the best performer without restricting the data distribution . with the estimated distributions of the diagnostic marker for the diseased and non - diseased subjects ,",
    "the associated cut - point can be estimated as the value where the two estimated densities are identical .",
    "furthermore , it is important to appropriately set cut - points in subpopulations and to understand the sources of false positive and false negative results .",
    "zhou et al .",
    "@xcite and pepe @xcite discussed the covariate effect on the accuracy of diagnostic tests and the estimation of the roc curve . ignoring the covariate effects may lead to biased inference about the accuracy of the test for distinguishing diseased and non - diseased subjects . in data analysis ,",
    "as pointed out in pepe ( @xcite ; page 135 ) ,  it might be of interest to calculate both the pooled and covariate - specific roc curves in order to ascertain the gains in accuracy that can be achieved by using covariate - specific thresholds . \"",
    "although much research has been done on the covariate - adjusted roc curve ( e.g. , @xcite ) , little has been done on the covariate - adjusted youden index and its associated cut - point . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", zhou @xcite studied the covariate - adjusted youden index by using the heteroscedastic regression model @xcite .    in this paper , a new model - free estimation framework",
    "is proposed , which directly estimates the covariate - adjusted cut - point without estimating the conditional densities . with the estimated cut - point",
    ", the covariate - adjusted youden index can be estimated through any one - dimensional non - parametric density estimation methods .",
    "in particular , the estimation framework formulates the estimation problem in a large margin classification framework , where the covariate - adjusted cut - point is modeled non - parametrically in a reproducing kernel hilbert space ( rkhs;@xcite ) .",
    "the proposed method is applied to pima indians diabetes study , and suggests the important effect of age in estimating the youden index and its associated cut - point .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review the estimation of the population - based youden index and its associated cut - point . in section 3 ,",
    "we introduce the covariate - adjusted youden index and its associated cut - point , and propose a model - free estimation framework based on the large margin classification for estimating the covariate - adjusted youden index and its associated cut - point .",
    "in section 4 , numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method . in section 5",
    ", we apply the proposed method to the pima indians diabetes dataset .",
    "section 6 contains some discussion , and the appendix is devoted to technical proofs .",
    "suppose that every observation consists of a continuously supported diagnostic measurement @xmath1 , and a binary variable @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes a diseased subject and @xmath4 otherwise .",
    "a cut - point @xmath5 is introduced so that a diseased status is predicted if @xmath6 and non - diseased otherwise .",
    "the roc curve is constructed to display the sensitivity , @xmath7 and the specificity , @xmath8 . to summarize the information in the roc curve , the youden index is defined as @xmath9 the youden index ranges from 0 to 1 , where @xmath10 represents a complete separation , and @xmath11 represents a complete overlap .",
    "the associated cut - point @xmath12 is the point that yields @xmath13 , @xmath14 furthermore , figure [ fig : youden ] depicts the youden index on a roc curve @xcite ."
