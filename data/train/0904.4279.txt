    "a paper of griffiths and li in this journal @xcite has triggered a lively discussion on the electrostatic equilibrium distribution of charge on a thin , straight , cylindrical conductor .",
    "while suspecting that as the diameter - to - length ratio of the conductor approaches zero the charge distribution on it tends to uniformity at all points sufficiently far from the ends , they encountered certain puzzling aspects of the problem in their numerical studies .",
    "in particular , they identified an apparent contradiction in the strict limit of zero diameter , posing the question that ``  if the charge density _ were _ constant , on a truly one - dimensional needle , how could the force on an off - center point be zero  ? ''    contributions by good @xcite and andrews @xcite followed the work of griffiths and li , offering further evidence of the uniformity conjecture of the latter , as well as alternative methods of analyzing the problem .",
    "however , it fell to jackson @xcite to provide a clear resolution of the equilibrium paradox quoted above by carefully considering the limit of vanishing diameter - to - length ratio and the crucial role of the slow , inverse - logarithmic approach of charge density to uniformity in that limit .",
    "a subsequent paper by jackson @xcite reported on his discovery that the problem in question had already been considered by none other than james clerk maxwell ! maxwell , treating `` the electrical capacity of a long narrow cylinder '' more than 130 years ago @xcite , had derived the inverse - logarithmic approach to uniformity noted by andrews and highlighted by jackson , and had eloquently summarized the behavior of electrostatic charges on a thin , straight conductor .",
    "maxwell s pioneering words on the subject turned out to be a very fitting last word as well .",
    "the purpose of this contribution is to investigate the distribution of charge on a thin , _ curved _ conductor , which we will often refer to as a _",
    "filament_. the intuition underlying this inquiry is the expectation that a sufficiently thin , smoothly curved filament , when viewed up close , would appear long and straight , so that the equilibrium behavior of charges on the filament should be nearly uniform just as in the case of straight conductors .",
    "this is indeed what we find and describe in this paper .",
    "we approach the problem of charge distribution on a physical filament in two steps .",
    "the first step is the treatment of the fields of any sufficiently smooth , one - dimensional distribution of charge , which we will often refer to as an _ ideal filament _ , with no regard to its conductivity properties .",
    "here we consider the behavior of the electric field components and the electrostatic potential in the limit of vanishing distance from an arbitrary point of the filament , and carry out an asymptotic analysis to calculate the divergent parts of these quantities explicitly .",
    "we find that the divergent parts of the radial and azimuthal electric field components , as well as the electric potential , are determined by the linear charge density of the filament at the point in question , whereas the axial component of the electric field is determined by the spacial derivative of linear charge density , or equivalently , the electric dipole density , at the point .",
    "the intuition underlying these results is discussed throughout , and the results are summarized in eqs .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) .    in the second step of our analysis , we relate the fields of the ideal filament to those of a physical one by casting the former as the symmetry axis of a curved , cylindrical conductor . here , we show that the equipotential surfaces of the physical filament approach those of the ideal one as its diameter vanishes , and use this to deduce the inverse - logarithmic approach of charge distribution to uniformity , the primary result of this paper , in eq .",
    "( [ 24 ] ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "iia we set up the geometry of the ideal filament and formulate the required regularity conditions . in ",
    "iib we present the derivation of the electric field components near the ideal filament , and in  iic we deal with the electrostatic potential .",
    "we then formulate the requirements of relating the fields of the physical filament to those of the ideal one in  iiia . in ",
    "iiib we consider the consequences of enforcing those requirements , whence we derive the result expressing the approach of charge density to uniformity .",
    "an alternative derivation of this result using energy minimization is developed in ",
    "examples of straight and circular filaments providing analytical illustrations of eqs .",

    "consider a charged filament in the limit of zero diameter , i.e. , idealized as an open or closed curve .",
    "we will assume this curve to be of class @xmath0 , or twice continuously differentiable , and parameterized by @xmath1 , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the arc length parameter @xcite .",
    "these regularity conditions guarantee the existence and continuity of the principal normal vector and curvature , as well as the tangent vector , at every point .",

    "these two unit vectors , together with the unit _ binormal _ vector @xmath8 , constitute a local orthogonal triad at each point of the curve .",
    "note that the regularity conditions stated above guarantee that @xmath7 is a continuous function , allowing us to define a radius of curvature @xmath9 which is continuous and has an infimum which we denote by @xmath10 .",
    "note also that the same conditions imply that the curve is non - self - intersecting , i.e. , that @xmath11 , except for closed filaments for which @xmath12 . the minimum radius of curvature and the length of the filament are the two relevant length scales for points near the filament , and we will find it convenient to use the scale parameter @xmath13 in the following analysis .",

    "( [ 23 ] ) reduces to the result first derived by maxwell @xcite ; cf . @xcite .",
    "we are now in a position to consider the physical problem of a charged , conducting filament in the limit of vanishing diameter . we will define the physical filament by reference to the equipotential surfaces of the idealized charge distribution treated in the previous section @xcite .",

    "the uniqueness property of the dirichlet problem would then assure us that the electrostatic field produced by @xmath53 in the exterior of @xmath128 is precisely the same as would be produced by the physical conductor if held at potential @xmath124 .",
    "furthermore , the surface charge per unit length of the physical conductor would be given by @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "having defined the physical conductor by reference to an assumed charge distribution , we have shifted the burden of our analysis to reconciling the resulting profile with the actual shape of the physical conductor .",
    "in particular , we might wonder if , for a given @xmath1 , it is possible to choose @xmath53 so that @xmath129 $ ] has a desired form , e.g. , that of a curved , circular cylinder of fixed diameter defined in  iia .",
    "here we have the benefit of the insight gained in the study of straight filaments , especially in refs .",
    "@xcite , where we find an affirmative answer .",
    "in particular , we know that a conductor with an ellipsoidal surface corresponds to a uniform charge distribution along the symmetry axis @xcite . we also know , starting with maxwell @xcite , that a thin , cylindrical conductor acquires a near - uniform charge distribution except for endpoints where higher charge densities occur .",
    "note that the field and charge configurations of a straight filament are azimuthally symmetric .    in the case of curved filaments of finite diameter , however , there s no such symmetry and one can not in general expect a one - dimensional charge distribution to properly reproduce the azimuthal distribution of the charges on the filament s surface .",
    "this shortcoming is of course a consequence of the mismatch between the dimensionality of an ideal filament and that of the surface of a conductor . by the same token",
    ", however , any difference between the two is expected to be small for a thin filament and tend to zero as its diameter vanishes .",
    "this expectation is in fact born out as the analysis below shows , and we will be able to determine the linear charge density of a sufficiently thin conductor regardless of its azimuthal variations .      the standard electrostatic boundary condition on a conductor is the uniformity of the potential throughout its interior and surface , a condition which follows from the vanishing of the electric field in the interior of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium .",
    "our problem then is to constrain @xmath53 such that @xmath130 $ ] turns out to be the curved , circular cylinder of fixed diameter defined above .",
    "equivalently , we will require the vanishing of the tangential components of the electric field on the surface of the conductor , starting with the axial component .",
    "the axial component was calculated in ",
    "iib where we found that @xmath131 as @xmath132 .",
    "the requirement that @xmath94 vanish in the limit immediately constrains the charge distribution according to @xmath133 recalling that @xmath134 is an arbitrary point of the filament ( with the exception of endpoints in case of open filaments ) , we conclude that , as its diameter tends to zero , the linear charge density on the filament tends to uniformity as the inverse of the logarithm of @xmath26 .",
    "this result generalizes and closely parallels those found for straight filaments , starting with maxwell s @xcite .",
    "next , we consider the azimuthal component of the electric field on the surface of the filament . at first blush , eq .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) seems to imply that the vanishing of the azimuthal component requires the eventual disappearance of all charges on the filament ! in reality , however , what is conveyed by eq .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) is simply that the equipotential surface @xmath135 $ ] generated by an ideal filament can not have a _ circular _ cross section except at points where the curvature of the filament vanishes .",
    "this is of course exactly what is expected , since the deviation from circularity is needed to balance the electric field component generated by the local curvature of the filament .",
    "this sort of behavior is already familiar from the study of straight conductors where variations in the diameter along the conductor are required to balance the effect of unequal distances from the ends , and has been discussed in detail in ref .",
    "needless to say , this circumstance does not imply that circular cross - section filaments are unphysical , only that our one - dimensional filament within is not capable of masquerading them .",
    "fortunately , it turns out that the deviation from circularity is quite small and disappears rapidly as @xmath58 .",
    "this is the justification for our use of an ideal charge filament to describe the distribution of charge on a thin , physical filament .    to establish the above assertion",

    "<S> the azimuthal variations vanish with the characteristic parameter , only more rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> these uniformity results yield an asymptotic formula for the capacitance of a curved filament that generalizes maxwell s original result </S>",
    "<S> . the examples of a straight filament with uniform and linearly varying charge densities , as well as a circular filament with a uniform charge distribution , are treated analytically and found to be in agreement with the results of the general analysis . </S>",
    "<S> numerical calculations illustrating the slow convergence of linear charge distribution to uniformity for an elliptical filament are presented , and an interactive computer program implementing and animating the numerical calculations is provided . </S>"
