    "the von neumann entropy @xcite is a measure of mixedness in a physical state described by a density matrix .",
    "the general rule is that the more orthogonal the states comprising the density matrix are , the higher the value of the corresponding entropy . looking at it from a different perspective , the entropy signifies the lack of knowledge we have about the exact pure state the system is in . for pure states ,",
    "the knowledge is maximal and the value of entropy is zero , while for a maximally mixed state ( the normalized identity matrix ) , the value of entropy is highest as any of the pure states in the mixture is equally likely .",
    "therefore , this intuition would suggest that distinguishability between states is the only parameter determining the value of entropy .",
    "we also note that entropy is a static property of the system ( i.e. it is only a function of the density matrix describing the state , rendering it completely insensitive to the dynamical evolution ) .    geometric phases , on the other hand ,",
    "are obtained when a physical system evolves through a ( discrete or continuous ) set of states .",
    "we can say that this phase depends only on the geometric aspects of this evolution ( i.e. it is , for instance , independent of the rate of evolution ) , but that it is still a dynamical property of the system .",
    "in other words , it is generated by dynamics , although the dynamics can be either a continuous schrdinger type evolution or a discrete quantum measurement ( of the most general type ) .",
    "the geometric phase has a long and interesting history , and we refer the interested reader to the collection of papers compiled by shapere and wilczek @xcite .",
    "no detailed knowledge of this will be necessary however , as all the relevant information will be given here .",
    "given that the entropy is a static property and geometric phase a dynamical property of a quantum system , we would not at first sight expect there to be any connections between the two .",
    "this conclusion is however incorrect and in this paper , we will show that entropy can in fact be written as a function of geometric phase ( and some other parameters in general ) .",
    "our work has been stimulated by jozsa and schlienz @xcite who pointed out that von neumann entropy can increase even when the ensemble of quantum states become less distinguishable ( i.e. more parallel ) .",
    "they noticed that this behaviour does not occur in a two dimensional hilbert space but emerges in a three dimensional hilbert space .",
    "their conclusion is that distinguishability is a global property ( considering the whole ensemble ) which can not be reduced to considering the pairwise overlaps of the states .    in this paper",
    ", we attribute this transition to the presence of a geometric phase by giving a closed - form solution of entropy as a function of geometric phase .",
    "we will begin by defining all the relevant variables .",
    "then we will work through the two and three dimensional cases .",
    "we also comment on the arbitrary dimensional case .",
    "we will finally briefly discuss a method to experimentally measure entropy and show that the same set up is also used for measuring geometric phases .",
    "it is for this reason precisely that the two concepts are related .",
    "interestingly , in two dimensions , the entropy is either a function of the phase or distinguishability , but we do not need both at the same time ( this is because the phase and distinguishability can directly be related to each other ) . for higher dimensions this relationship becomes more complicated as we will show and throughout the paper we discuss mathematical and physical reasons for this difference between two and higher dimensional systems",
    ". we will conclude by discussing the implications of our results with possible generalizations .",
    "as we have already said , entropy is a physical quantity that quantifies the lack of information in a given ensemble .",
    "suppose the ensemble contains three quantum states @xmath0 respectively where @xmath1 .",
    "we can construct the density operator @xmath2 and the von neumann entropy as @xmath3 where the boltzmann constant @xmath4 . rather than state vectors , we shall be predominantly working with coherence vectors which is a completely analogous description .",
    "this is because we can generalize to higher number of states than the dimension of the system .",
    "any density operator for two dimensions can be written as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 are the pauli matrices : @xmath7 @xmath8 is a three component coherence vector and @xmath9 denotes the scalar product . in three dimensions",
    "any state can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the gell - mann matrices : @xmath12 and @xmath8 is now an eight component coherence vector .",
    "note that our representation of the state in terms of pauli and gell - mann matrices is not unique .",
    "any other appropriate basis will be related to this basis through an orthogonal matrix transformation that would be @xmath13 and @xmath14 dimensional respectively @xcite . for arbitrary dimensions ,",
    "the density matrix is given by : @xmath15 where @xmath8 is the @xmath16 element coherence vector and @xmath11 are @xmath17 matrices satisfying the lie algebra of su(d ) @xcite .",
    "the mixedness is introduced in the coherence vectors by @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the coherence vectors corresponding to the @xmath20th state .",
    "we now introduce a quantity called the perimeter , @xmath21 , defined as : @xmath22 this quantity tells us how different the three states are on average .",
    "the larger the perimeter , the more orthogonal the states become . note that this quantity is related to the sum of the overlaps of the quantum states ( for example in three dimensions ) : @xmath23 the negative sign makes sense because the more / less parallel the states are , the smaller / larger the perimeter . if the states are identical , @xmath24 ( since @xmath25 and if they are orthogonal , @xmath26 ( since @xmath27 for @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the dimension of the system ) .",
    "note that this is for the three dimensional case . with three states",
    ", we can visualize the perimeter as the square distances of each side of a triangle with each vertex representing a quantum state ( see figure [ blochjul3 ] ) .",
    "as soon as we consider more states , the usual meaning of perimeter breaks down because we must include more than two distances for each state .",
    "for example with four states , we will have the square distances of each side of a four sided polygon as well as the two lines adjoining opposite vertices ( see figure [ blochjul4 ] ) .",
    "hence the term `` average distinguishability '' may be more appropriate than perimeter but we will continue to use the latter throughout the paper .",
    "we would now expect , as mentioned earlier in the introduction , that the larger the perimeter , the more distinguishable ( orthogonal ) the states comprising the mixture , and the higher the value of the entropy .",
    "this is , as will be shown in more detail soon , true for qubits , but fails in higher dimensions in general .",
    "before we go into the main topic of the paper , we point out another important issue .",
    "namely , changing the definition of the perimeter and @xmath30 by removing the squares in equations ( [ perimeter ] ) and ( [ q ] ) respectively , changes the behaviour of the perimeter with respect to the entropy . in particular",
    ", we can now observe an increase in entropy by decreasing the perimeter ( or equivalently increasing the overlap ) for the two dimensional ensemble contrary to @xcite .",
    "let us consider the following states : @xmath31 or equivalently the following coherence vectors : @xmath32 \\\\    { \\mathbf{n}}_2 & = & [ \\sin(\\theta_2)\\cos(\\phi_2),\\sin(\\theta_2)\\sin(\\phi_2),\\cos(\\theta_2 ) ] \\\\",
    "{ \\mathbf{n}}_3 & = & [ \\sin(\\theta_3)\\cos(\\phi_3),\\sin(\\theta_3)\\sin(\\phi_3),\\cos(\\theta_3)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us fix @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and vary @xmath36 from @xmath37 . in the bloch sphere picture",
    ", the states lie on the equator with each state initially equally spaced .",
    "@xmath38 or @xmath39 rotates around once remaining on the equatorial plane while keeping the other two states fixed .",
    "figure [ pqanomaly ] shows the anomaly .",
    "since this behaviour is counterintuitive , we will hereafter continue to use the original definitions of @xmath21 and @xmath30 because they avoid the above anomaly and allow a simple relationship between the perimeter and the total overlap .",
    "so , in summary , we now have that the larger the perimeter ( or equivalently the smaller the @xmath30 ) , the larger the von neumann entropy keeping all other variables constant .    the geometric phase is a phase that is observed when a state evolves in parameter space ( e.g. the parameter could be a magnetic field strength ) @xcite .",
    "a more amenable interpretation for our present purposes is the quantum version of the pancharatnam relative phase @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a concise modern introduction .",
    "we can calculate the geometric phase @xmath40 by : @xmath41 for three states in two dimensions , we get : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the ordinary cross product . for three states in three dimensions ,",
    "we get @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 . @xmath47",
    "refer to the components of the vectors , @xmath48 are the antisymmetric @xmath49 structure constants and @xmath50 are the symmetric tensors .",
    "note that @xmath51 refers to the phase taking three states of any dimensionality .",
    "exact definitions and other useful formulae are given in @xcite but for convenience , we state them here : @xmath52=2if_{ijk}\\lambda_k\\ ] ] @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 other useful formulae are : @xmath57 @xmath58    the visibility is defined by : @xmath59 where the name originates from @xmath60 corresponding to how visible or how large the amplitude is in an interferometer @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath61 is equal to the denominator of @xmath62 given in equations ( [ geometricphase2 ] ) and ( [ geometricphase3 ] ) for two and three dimensions respectively .",
    "in this section we obtain the following results .",
    "we first show that in two dimensions , the entropy depends on either the perimeter or the product of the visibility and the cosine of the geometric phase but not both together .",
    "we next show that for three states in three dimensions , we need both quantities and nothing else . the same is shown to be true for three states in any dimension as expected .",
    "then we show that for many states in three dimensions , the entropy depends now on the perimeter and all the possible combinations of the product of the visibility and the cosine of the geometric phase for every triplet of states . in the last subsection",
    ", we generalize to any dimensions and any number of states by using a closed - form solution of the entropy obtained by chumakov et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "note that our results will apply for general mixtures of pure states , i.e. unequal probabilities , however , we will frequently express them with equal probabilities for convenience .",
    "as is shown in @xcite , entropy can not be increased by increasing the average overlap of the ensemble in two dimensions for any number of states .",
    "we will show this by giving an explicit formula of von neumann entropy as a function of perimeter .",
    "we can also rewrite it as a function of geometric phase ( modulated by the visibility as will be defined later in this section ) but the three quantities will not appear together in the function .",
    "we must first find the eigenvalues @xmath63 of the density operator which will give @xmath64 .",
    "introduce @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "the first subscript refers to the state , the second subscript refers to the vector component and @xmath67 denotes the number of states .",
    "the eigenvalues are @xmath68 .",
    "note that @xmath69 . since @xmath70 and generalizing the definition of @xmath21 above to @xmath67 states ( @xmath71 becomes @xmath72 ) , @xmath73 .",
    "this gives : @xmath74 figure [ vne2vp ] plots this .",
    "we see that the von neumann entropy is a monotonically increasing function of perimeter . using equation ( [ geometricphase2 ] )",
    ", we can also write @xmath75 for @xmath76 where @xmath77 . we find that in two dimensions , increasing the geometric phase corresponds to an increase in entropy ( negative values of @xmath78 become unphysical since at most @xmath26 and this corresponds to all three states being orthogonal which is not possible in two dimensions ) . likewise",
    ", decreasing @xmath60 corresponds to an increase in @xmath21 and hence entropy . for larger number of states",
    ", we can define the perimeter as a function of @xmath79 for all the combinations of three states : @xmath80 where @xmath81 we can see that even for larger number of states in two dimensions , since the perimeter increases as geometric phase increases , the von neumann entropy also increases .",
    "note that in the case of unequal prior probabilities , there is no straightforward method of relating the perimeter to the geometric phase unless we redefine the geometric phase by incorporating the unequal prior probabilities .",
    "the above calculations were for equal prior probabilities ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "if we consider instead unequal prior probabilities @xmath83 , we must redefine the perimeter : @xmath84 and then we obtain : @xmath85 and therefore entropy is still just a function of the perimeter .",
    "we can see that this reduces to the equal prior probability result above and when @xmath86 , @xmath87 thus @xmath88 , as it should be for a pure state .",
    "similar steps are taken as the previous subsection .",
    "first we introduce the coherence vector @xmath89 with equal prior probabilities .",
    "the perimeter is given by @xmath90 .",
    "our density matrix is now a three by three matrix , and in order to compute its entropy we need to be able to find the eigenvalues first .",
    "this leads to solving the following cubic equation : @xmath91 where @xmath92 with @xmath93 .",
    "the solution is given by @xcite : @xmath94 where @xmath95 the von neumann entropy is : @xmath96 let us look at a couple of examples .",
    "the first example uses the three states given in @xcite : @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 . by setting @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102",
    ", we can set the geometric phase @xmath40 and visibility @xmath60 to vanish .",
    "then by varying @xmath103 , we can observe the dependence of von neumann entropy @xmath104 on perimeter @xmath21 between @xmath105 as is shown in figure [ vne3vpconstvgamma ] .    as is the case in two dimensions ( figure [ vne2vp ] ) , @xmath104 increases monotonically when @xmath21 increases .",
    "note that @xmath104 is bounded by the maximum entropy allowable in a @xmath29 dimensional system @xmath106 .",
    "in fact the monotonically increasing property can be explicitly checked by differentiating equation ( [ vne3 ] ) with respect to @xmath21 and realizing the result to be positive for the above range of @xmath21 . in order to inspect smaller values of @xmath21 , we must also vary @xmath60 or @xmath40 .",
    "the second example uses the three states given in @xcite : @xmath107 where @xmath40 is the geometric phase which is bounded here by @xmath108 radians .",
    "these three states keep @xmath60 and @xmath21 fixed so that we can inspect how @xmath104 depends on @xmath40 alone . by calculating the perimeter , geometric phase and visibility and using equation ( [ vne3 ] ) , we obtain figure [ vne3vgammaconstvp ] which is identical to the graph given in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the two dimensional case where we can only increase / decrease the entropy as we increase / decrease the geometric phase , we also have that the entropy decreases / increases as the geometric phase increases / decreases .",
    "why should there be a transition between the two to the three dimensional case ? mathematically speaking , the distinctions are that the symmetric tensor does not exist in two dimensions and the isomorphism between @xmath109 and @xmath110 does not exist between @xmath49 and @xmath111 .",
    "this means that in the eight dimensional ball , there are patches corresponding to unphysical states and therefore our intuition of what the phase is geometrically as well as how the perimeter changes is lost .",
    "a precise formulation of this remark is left for future research .",
    "we can increase the number of dimensions arbitrarily by considering three general states @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "we can construct the density operator with equal prior probabilities , @xmath115 . as",
    "the above states are not orthogonal , we use the gram - schmidt procedure to obtain the following orthogonal states : @xmath116 we can invert these and substitute into the density operator . by noting that @xmath117 ( used instead of perimeter ) and @xmath118 we find that : @xmath119 which give : @xmath120 by noting that @xmath121 and @xmath122 gives @xmath123 , we find that these equations are identical to the equivalent ones appearing in the previous subsection . this is not surprising because three states in arbitrary dimensions can be represented by a rank three matrix .",
    "the important point to observe is that we do not require any other quantity to define entropy .",
    "we still only require the total overlap ( or perimeter ) , geometric phase and visibility .    for unequal prior probabilities , we do not get a simple generalization as in the two dimensional case because we have a mixture of probabilities to the power of two and to the power of three which can not be factored out .",
    "we have explicitly : @xmath124 they reduce to the equal prior probability case and for a pure state , @xmath125 therefore when substituting into equation ( [ x1x2x3 ] ) , we obtain the desired @xmath88 .",
    "it is interesting to note that now @xmath126 contains the overlap as well as the visibility and geometric phase , hence altering the above form of entropy . since the probabilities directly influence how mixed the ensemble is , it is not surprising that the form of the entropy should change .",
    "we have so far looked at only three states in effectively three dimensions .",
    "we will now consider the three dimensional case with @xmath127 number of states .",
    "we now have @xmath128 .",
    "the perimeter can be written in a compact form as : @xmath129 note that this is also true for any dimensions .",
    "another useful formula is : @xmath130\\ ] ] also true for any dimensions .",
    "we know that the cubic coefficients @xmath131 and @xmath132 remain the same as before .",
    "@xmath133 is the only one that needs to be modified .",
    "we find that : @xmath134 notice that when @xmath135 , this reduces to the aforementioned three state case .",
    "it is interesting to note that the geometric phase term still contains only three states albeit with all the possible combinations of three states .",
    "we know that the von neumann entropy can be expanded in a power series @xmath136 where @xmath137 are the expansion coefficients .",
    "the exact values of the @xmath137 s are not relevant for our discussion .",
    "keyl and werner @xcite have shown that in order to calculate the eigenvalues of a @xmath29 dimensional density matrix , it is necessary and sufficient to obtain all the traces of the powers of the density matrix up to the @xmath29th power .",
    "@xmath138 contains the perimeter and @xmath139 contains the geometric phase with three states as is shown in the next section . with a @xmath29 dimensional system ,",
    "the entropy will contain geometric phase terms up to @xmath29 states . obtaining a closed - form solution of the entropy for higher than four dimensions",
    "is difficult because there is no equation using only radicals to solve the quintic or higher equation .",
    "however , chumakov et .",
    "@xcite have a closed - form solution for arbitrary dimensional systems which requires traces of powers of the density matrices up to @xmath29 . in turn",
    ", these traces contain only the perimeter and all combinations of the product of visibility and the cosine of the geometric phase up to @xmath29 states , e.g. @xmath140 .",
    "so we conclude that even for higher dimensional systems , the entropy can be expressed as a function of perimeter and the product of visibility and the cosine of the geometric phases .",
    "also , this is a natural way to view the fact that entropy should be a function of perimeter and geometric phases as will be also clear from the next section .",
    "we use the simple quantum network based on the controlled - swap gate presented in @xcite which extracts properties of quantum states bypassing the need for quantum tomography . physically , the network is a representation of the mach - zehnder interferometer @xcite .",
    "since we have shown the von neumann entropy as a function of perimeter ( overlap ) , geometric phase and visibility , we can experimentally measure this entropy by calculating @xmath141 for the perimeter and @xmath142 for the visibility and geometric phase where @xmath143 with equal prior probabilities for three states in three dimensions .",
    "however , we can generalize this experimental procedure for any dimensions and any number of states by calculating the traces of up to the @xmath29th power of the density matrix @xmath144 where @xmath127 is the number of states .",
    "consider a setup with two separable subsystems @xmath145 and three separable subsystems @xmath146 .",
    "we now introduce the swap operator @xmath147 , @xmath148 and the shift operator @xmath149 , @xmath150 for any pure states @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 . the experimental procedure which will be described shortly measures @xmath154 @xcite and similarly @xmath155",
    ". this can be readily generalized to the @xmath29th power of @xmath156 using the general shift operator @xmath157 where @xmath158 so that @xmath159 .",
    "we find on expansion : @xmath160 the last line follows from @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "hence on obtaining @xmath30 and @xmath163 , we can calculate @xmath104 for three states in three dimensions . in principle , we can also expand @xmath164 to show that it contains @xmath30 and all the combinations of the product of visibility and the cosine of the geometric phase .",
    "figure [ experiment ] shows the experimental set up that may be used to measure the von neumann entropy ( the diagram shows the case for two inputs of @xmath156 but for a rank @xmath29 density matrix , we must inspect up to @xmath29 inputs of @xmath156 ) .",
    "we will briefly describe how it calculates @xmath138 , and then @xmath164 is a straightforward extension .",
    "we begin with the initial state @xmath165 .",
    "we apply the first hadamard gate @xmath166 : @xmath167 then we apply the phase shift @xmath168 to get @xmath169 .",
    "next is the controlled - swap operation : @xmath170 and finally another hadamard to obtain : @xmath171 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since measuring the intensity @xmath172 is proportional to the probability , we can measure in the computational basis @xmath173 to get : @xmath174 \\nonumber\\\\     & \\propto & tr\\rho",

    "then we acquire @xmath178 .",
    "we also obtain @xmath139 following similar steps .",
    "we can obtain the von neumann entropy via ( [ trrho2 ] ) and ( [ trrho3 ] ) for three dimensions .",
    "naturally , we can calculate the von neumann entropy for @xmath29 dimensional systems by calculating the trace of the powers of @xmath156 up to @xmath29 and utilizing the formula given in @xcite .",
    "so we see that the set up in figure [ experiment ] allows us to measure both the entropy and the product of the visibility and the cosine of the geometric phase .",
    "we have explicitly shown the dependence of entropy on the perimeter , geometric phase and the visibility .",
    "for an arbitrary number of states in the two dimensional case , entropy is solely a function of perimeter whereas for three states in three dimensions and more states in higher dimensions , entropy is no longer just a function of perimeter but also of geometric phase and visibility . finally we have shown a possible way to obtain the von neumann entropy experimentally .",
    "the same experimental interferometric set up can also be used to measure the visibility and geometric phase associated with a set of pure states .",
    "this clarifies why physically the two seemingly unrelated concepts of entropy and geometric phase should in fact depend on each other .",
    "finally , we would like to speculate on the possibility of the geometric phase playing a role in black hole entropy @xcite .",
    "it is well established that black hole entropy is proportional to the area of its event horizon .",
    "similarly , in the two dimensional hilbert space , the geometric phase is given by half the solid angle subtended by states involved .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the entropy in this case is only a function of the geometric phase ( modulated by the visibility ) , and as the phase increases so does the entropy .",
    "so , we have the same kind of behaviour as for black holes , namely that the larger the area the larger the entropy .",
    "this dependence breaks down in higher dimensions ( as we have seen we can increase the phase and decrease the entropy ) .",
    "of course , the two areas do not live in the same space .",
    "the black hole area arises from the physical boundary separating the black hole from the rest of the universe whereas the geometric phase is an area in hilbert space . a very interesting theme for future research would be to investigate if this fact has any deeper significance and whether it implies that the information in a black hole is made up of basic two dimensional units ( qubits ) rather than higher dimensional units .",
    "alternatively we can explore the possibility of having states in higher dimensional hilbert spaces whose contribution to the entropy from the perimeter would be small while dominated by the geometric phase .    *",
