    "the frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model is a classical infinite chain of atoms linked by elastic springs with equilibrium spacing @xmath0 , subject to an external periodic potential of period @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it is a simple model for the description of dislocations in solids but has also been applied to interfacial slip in earthquakes@xcite , the dynamics of dna denaturation @xcite , as well as other areas @xcite .",
    "the fk model is characterized by the competition of two different length scales , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and two energy scales set by the external potential and the spring elastic energy .",
    "the static configurations of lowest energy have a rather complex dependence on these parameters : they can be commensurate or incommensurate with the period of the external potential @xcite and the transition between them is a critical phenomenon exhibiting scaling @xcite .",
    "the fk model has been analyzed based on a connection with two dimensional area - preserving maps , such as the standard map @xcite .",
    "aubry@xcite and mather@xcite have shown that the lowest energy configurations correspond to invariant sets of the associated maps that can be kam tori , cantor sets ( cantori ) , or limit cycles corresponding respectively to unpinned incommensurate , pinned incommensurate and pinned commensurate configurations .",
    "it was recently discovered that a continuum hydrodynamic type of evolution underlies the fk models @xcite .",
    "for the case of an elastic chain of particles embedded in an external potential , this evolution is governed by a periodically - forced inviscid burgers equation and the associated flow of characteristics turns out to be closely related to the particle configurations .",
    "this connection was further developed by e and sobolevskii @xcite ( see also the review by bec and khanin @xcite ) .    the purpose of the present article is to illustrate and further investigate the relation between fk models and its description in terms of a forced burgers equation by explicitly working out an example .",
    "this is desirable for two reasons : on the one hand , the results obtained in @xcite are mathematical , centering mostly around existence theorems and properties of the flow with less emphasis on connections with particular physical models .",
    "it would therefore be useful to consider an example that can be exactly solved using this approach , and thereby illustrate explicitly how the flow properties relate to physical properties of the fk model such as the lowest energy configurations and excited states .",
    "on the other hand , most of the results on fk models focus on the lowest energy configuration from which other properties such as the stability region of a given configuration can be obtained .",
    "however , the burgers description and in particular the flow patterns provide additional insight , allowing us to construct analytically the excited states with and without discommensurations and to see how the flow pattern changes as the parameters of the model are varied , particularly near the boundary of a region of stability .",
    "the description of fk models by an underlying one parameter continuum flow also constitutes a novel technique which should be applicable to the larger class of problems @xcite mentioned above , as well as fk models with more complex external potentials @xcite .",

    "we briefly review the basic results due to aubry , aubry and collaborators , and mather @xcite .",

    "we focus on the fk model with a piece - wise parabolic potential .",
    "this model is interesting in its own right , as it is related to other fk models in the limit of strong external potential where the particles are confined to regions close to the potential minima .",

    "in fact , the case of a piece - wise parabolic potential can be considered as the limit when the external potential is so strong that particles are mostly confined to the bottom of the potential wells , which can be approximated by parabolic segments .",
    "it is therefore natural to consider potentials that deviate from being piece - wise parabolic .",

    "knowing where this might break down would shed further light on the relation between shapes of external potentials and the intricate phase diagrams for the structure of their lowest energy configurations .",

    "in fact , the existence of such a global segment is guaranteed under rather general conditions @xcite .",
    "since the global segment contains the global minimizers , we were able to obtain these by simply searching for the characteristic trajectories in this region having the appropriate periodicity .",
    "the flow in the global region also allows us to calculate the backwards flow of characteristics in the vicinity of the global minimizer to which they necessarily converge .",
    "however , as long as the location of the shocks marking the boundary of the global region are not known , it can not be asserted whether these characteristics are genuine one - sided minimizers and thus correspond to lowest energy configurations of the semi - infinite chain or not . to give an example , without the knowledge of the locations of shocks in fig .",
    "[ fig : dislocation_example ] , the corresponding particle configurations on the right panel can not be determined .",
