    "present information on the solar neutrino spectrum is based on the very tail of the total neutrino flux ( about 0.2% ) . the low energy part of the spectrum , and in particular _",
    "pp_-neutrino flux , has not been measured directly yet .",
    "after the observation of reactor neutrino oscillations by the kamland collaboration @xcite , the spectrometry of the low energy solar neutrinos is important for the confirmation of the lma msw scenario , for the restricting of the allowed lma parameters region @xcite , as well as for the search of the neutrino nonstandard properties .",
    "the _ pp _ neutrinos measurement is a critical test of stellar evolution theory and of neutrino oscillation solutions .",
    "pp_neutrino flux is predicted by the standard solar model ( ssm ) with a precision of the order of 1% , in contrast to the 20% precision predictions of the high energy neutrino flux from the @xmath1 .",
    "a discussion of the physics potential of the _ pp _ solar neutrino flux can be found in @xcite,@xcite and @xcite . a number of projects aiming to build _",
    "pp_-neutrino spectrometers are in the different stages of research and development .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is commonly assumed that the @xmath2 content sets the limit on the sensitivity at the low energy region in liquid organic scintillators . a ratio as low as @xmath3 g / g was achieved with ctf detector .",
    "there are indications that the content of @xmath2 can be even smaller , of the order of @xmath4 g / g @xcite in this case have to be excluded during petroleum refinement @xcite .",
    "the existing ctf setup is a suitable device for the search of the organic ls with minimal @xmath2 contamination . ] . in this case",
    "the @xmath2 contribution in the background can be reduced by a factor 2000 .",
    "it is interesting to study the dependence on the content of the @xmath2 in the scintillator for the sensitivity of the detector to the pp neutrinos .",
    "the results of the study are summarized in table [ table : c14 ] .",
    "one can see that the detector sensitivity varies rather slowly with the decrease of the @xmath2 content in the scintillator .",
    "there are several reasons for this behaviour .",
    "first of all , the pp neutrino rate is quite low and with minimal background contribution the statistical fluctuations of the pp- rate are the major source of the uncertainty . another source of uncertainty is the irreduceable internal background which becomes comparable to the @xmath2 events contribution with the lower @xmath2 content .",
    "the last reason is the lower threshold of the detector of about 25 kev , which ca nt be decreased without increasing the random electronics noise . in order to avoid the influence of the threshold effect on the spectrum shape",
    "it is necessary to set the software threshold even higher , to about 40 kev .",
    "another motivation to set a higher software threshold is the presence of low energy external gammas which can be reconstructed inside the fiducial volume due to the poor spatial resolution at low energies .",
    "we can conclude that lower @xmath2 content would be desirable but is not critical for the detector sensitivity to _",
    "pp_ neutrinos .",
    "a potential danger are the @xmath2 pile - up events , i.e. events occurring sequentially within a coincidence window .",
    "such events can in principle influence the @xmath2 spectrum tail .",
    "the fraction of the @xmath2 pile - up events with energies above 170@xmath6kev is about 5% .",
    "the total amount of pile - up events depends on the @xmath2 relative abundance and on the coincidence window :    @xmath7    where t is the total time of the data taking , @xmath8 is the coincidence gate width , and @xmath9 is the frequency of the @xmath2 events . for a @xmath2 abundance of @xmath3 g / g ,",
    "the mean rate of the events caused by @xmath2 @xmath10- decay is 2.2@xmath6hz . with these values",
    "the number of pile - up events is 2.5 per day , and the number of events with energy greater then 170 kev is only about 0.13 per day .",
    "the selection of point - like events provides a further possibility to suppress the amount of these events by a factor of at least @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the spatial resolution at 170@xmath6@xmath6kev and @xmath13 is the radius of the fiducial volume .",
    "thus , one can conclude that pile - up events will not influence the shape of the @xmath2 spectrum within the considered energy interval .",
    "the external background counts are caused mainly by the radioactive contamination of the pmt glass with @xmath14 and elements of the u - th chain .",
    "the assumed content of the @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the pmts is @xmath18g / pmt , @xmath19g / pmt and @xmath20g / pmt respectively , which corresponds to the measured radioactive contamination of the phototubes produced with high purity glass @xcite .",
    "we add 30% to these values to account for the radioactive contamination of the concentrator and pmt divider , sealing and support structure .",
    "another source of external gammas is radon dissolved in the water buffer .",
    "the results of a simulation show that a r<150 cm spatial cut will eliminate all the events in the neutrino window ( 170250- kev ) . nevertheless , in order to reduce the background from the penetrating gamma s we suggest to reduce the amount of the construction materials contributing to the background . a significant amount of the material in borexino is contained in the mu - metal shield of the pmts , which provides the screening of the pmts against the terrestrial magnetic field .",
    "an alternative solution based on the pmts orientation has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the effect of the pmts orientation is comparable to the one achieved with the pmt screening with the high magnetic permeability metal .",
    "use of this technique could eliminate about 1 kg of material for each pmt in proximity to the inner vessel .",
    "another possibility to reduce the gamma background assumes the use of a different topology of the events produced by the electrons and gammas .",
    "the excellent spatial resolution of the detector will permit distinguishing point - like energy deposits for electrons from the distributed gamma events ( @xmath21 discrimination ) .",
    "the study of the possibility of such discrimination for the borexino detector is now in progress .",
    "the cosmic ray induced background can be subdivided into the three categories :    1 .   muons crossing the water buffer of the detector , producing cerenkov light ; 2 .",
    "neutrons produced by muon interactions , and sequentially stopped in the water or the scintillator and emitting a 2.2 mev annihilation gamma ; 3 .",
    "secondary radioactive nuclei produced in the muon interactions inside the detector .",
    "most of the background counts associated with muons can be effectively removed by the muon identifying system ( muon veto ) .",
    "one can use the time and spatial structure of the muon induced events in order to recognize them .",
    "the muon identification procedure was able to recognize 95% of the muon induced events in the ctf - i detector @xcite .",
    "we assume also the use of a set of pmts situated on the top and bottom of the cylindrical external tank that will increase the muon identification to a value approaching 100% .",
    "some of the radioactive products of the muon interactions with the scintillator have significant life times , that makes it impossible to use a muon tag .",
    "these isotopes are @xmath22 ( @xmath23 , 11.5@xmath6mev , 13.8@xmath6s ) , @xmath24 ( @xmath25",
    "1.9@xmath6mev + @xmath26,0.72@xmath6mev , 19.3 s ) , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 , 0.99@xmath6mev , 20.38@xmath6min ) and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 0.478@xmath6mev , 53.3@xmath6d ) .",
    "the considered neutrino window is too narrow to pick up a significant amount of events from these isotopes .",
    "precise evaluations are now in progress for the borexino detector @xcite , but this background will certainly be negligible in comparison to the other sources considered .",
    "in the calculations we used ssm fluxes given by the standard solar model@xcite , neutrino energy spectra from @xcite@xcite and survival probabilities for the lma solar neutrino scenario from @xcite .",
    "signal shapes were convolved with the detectors response function using ( [ model ] ) .      the expected _",
    "pp_neutrino count for the lma solar neutrino oscillation scenario is listed in table [ table : c14 ] .",
    "the sensitivity was estimated with the monte carlo ( mc ) method .",
    "first , the total signal was calculated taking into account the detector s resolution . in the next step",
    "the normally distributed random signal was generated at each bin .",
    "a fitting function consists of a function with 3 contributes describing the internal background ( without @xmath31 , the spectrum of the @xmath2 decay and the neutrino signal :    @xmath32    the shape of the internal background bkg(q ) was fixed , but its normalization ( @xmath33 ) was free .",
    "another free parameter is the normalization of the @xmath2 spectrum @xmath34 .",
    "the expected rates are listed in table [ table : c14 ] .",
    "the neutral current channel for the neutrinos of non- electron flavours are taken into account in the calculations .",
    "other neutrino sources also have non- negligible contributions to the total signal in this energy window .",
    "the main source besides the _ pp _ are @xmath29 neutrinos with a flat spectrum ( see fig.[fig : ew ] ) .",
    "using model ( [ formula : fittingfunc ] ) we find out that the total neutrino flux will be measured with 7.5% ( 1@xmath35 ) relative precision .",
    "possible systematics errors due to the unknown shape of the background are not included in the estimation .",
    "we assume that the mc simulation can reproduce the form of the background and only the total normalization of this shape is unknown .",
    "the assumption is reasonable because of the quite narrow signal window , where the background is dominated by the slowly varying continuous spectrum of the soft part of the gamma spectra of radioactive impurities .",
    "the detector will count 1070 @xmath29 ssm lma neutrinos per year in the 200700- kev energy window with an internal background of 1130 events .",
    "for comparison , the borexino detector will count 9390 events in the 250 - 750 kev energy window with a background of @xmath3710500 events .",
    "we are not presenting here the evaluation of the sensitivity of the detector to the @xmath29 neutrinos .",
    "it is clear that the lower mass ( factor 10 ) with comparison to the borexino detector will limit the sensitivity .",
    "a certain gain in the sensitivity can be achieved due to better energy resolution of the detector ( factor 2.1 ) .",
    "the sensitivity relative to borexino for equal time of data taking and equal specific background can be estimated as @xmath38 for the measurements on the edge of the recoil electrons of the @xmath29 neutrino ( about 660 kev ) .",
    "the performance of the detector can be improved by using any of the following ideas :    1 .   * use of the specially designed photomultipliers , providing better quantum efficiency*. the basic idea is the `` recycling '' of the incoming photons .",
    "various optical arrangements have been used to improve light absorption by letting incoming light interact with the photocathode material more than once ( see i.e. @xcite ) .",
    "the idea has been revived in recent works @xcite,@xcite , where the authors reported significant increase of the quantum efficiency , up to a factor 2 .",
    "there are also indications on the possibility of creating a photocathode with very high quantum efficiency using a material doped with nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "use of the beta / gamma discrimination techniques*. the use of a different topology of the point - like beta events and the spatially distributed gamma- events can provide an opportunity to discriminate between beta and gamma induced signals with high efficiency .",
    "the method exploits the superior resolutions of the detector .",
    "* choice of the organic scintillator with lower content of @xmath2 .",
    "* there are indications that the content of @xmath2 can be much smaller than measured with the ctf - i detector , namely of the order of @xmath4 g / g @xcite . in this case the @xmath2 contribution in the background can be significantly reduced , and will lead to an improvement of the detector s characteristics .",
    "it is shown that a high energy resolution detector with the radiopurity levels necessary for the operation of borexino , as well as solar neutrino project of kamland , will be sensitive to solar _ pp_neutrinos .",
    "the project can compete with other existing proposals ( see table@xmath6[tab : experiments ] ) .",
