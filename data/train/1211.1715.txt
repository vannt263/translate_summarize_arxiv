    "we trivialize the bundle of complex anti - linear maps by introducing the linear map @xmath1089 and taking the @xmath1090 complex anti linear map @xmath234 to the @xmath482 complex anti - linear map @xmath1091 .",
    "let @xmath1092 denote @xmath1081 in that trivialization : @xmath1093 then @xmath1092 is a @xmath482 complex anti - linear map from @xmath1094 to @xmath1095 , i.e.  we have trivialized the bundle of complex anti linear maps in @xmath1069 in the @xmath343-direction for fixed @xmath1096 .",
    "we then define the map @xmath418 in this trivialization as follows : recalling @xmath1070 , @xmath1097 where , for @xmath1064 , @xmath1098 denotes the covariant derivative in direction @xmath1099 of a vector field equal to @xmath343 at @xmath82 and with first derivative @xmath1100 .",

    "this means that @xmath1115 is in fact independent of @xmath313 , @xmath1116 , and we get @xmath1117 squaring and integrating , using the fact that the @xmath573-norm ( two derivatives in @xmath279 ) controls the supremum norm , we find that this term is also controlled by @xmath1112 this finishes the proof .",

    "an element @xmath1129 gives a map @xmath1130 , which is the re - parametrization discussed above of the map @xmath1131 , originally defined on @xmath759 .",
    "the map @xmath1132 then solves the floer equation on @xmath158 if and only if @xmath1133 .",
    "we let @xmath1134 be the map which equals @xmath1135 on @xmath1136 .",
    "the distance functions in @xmath249 and @xmath1124 are induced from configuration spaces which are banach manifolds with norms that control the @xmath685-norm .",

    "we conclude that for small enough @xmath744 , the map is a @xmath258 embedding in an @xmath744-neighborhood of any point .",

    "we have a holomorphic map which converges to a constant ( since there can not be further bubbling ) .",
    "in particular , the map of the strip eventually lies completely inside the region where the lagrangian immersion agrees with @xmath1161 .",
    "since the almost complex structure is standard here and since the hamiltonian term vanishes in the region in @xmath786 corresponding to the strip , we can write down the solutions explicitly : @xmath1162 where @xmath1163 .",
