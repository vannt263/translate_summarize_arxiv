    "granular matter has been the subject of numerous studies since the last decade @xcite . indeed ,",
    "most of the industrial products are processed , transported and stocked in a granular state .",
    "the packing density of those granular materials becomes therefore a relevant parameter for a broad range of applications .",
    "the best way to reduce the costs for the manipulation of such granular materials is to increase the packing density @xmath3 .",
    "this can be achieved by tapping or vibrating the vessel containing the grains .",
    "various experimental studies @xcite have underlined the fact that the dynamics of compaction is a complex problem .",
    "the compaction dynamics is indeed characterized by a slow dynamics @xcite .",
    "different laws have been proposed for the volume fraction evolution of a granular material as a function of the number @xmath4 of taps . among others ,",
    "one has proposed the inverse logarithmic law @xmath5 where the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively the asymptotic volume fraction and the maximum variation of the volume fraction .",
    "the dimensionless parameter b depends on the acceleration during each tap and @xmath8 is the relaxation time of the reorganization process .",
    "this inverse logarithmic law of @xmath4 was obtained in numerical models for compaction like the tetris model and could also be derived from theoretical arguments @xcite .",
    "the great majority of earlier experiments have considered the compaction dynamics of spherical grains @xcite .",
    "only a few papers discuss the problem of anisotropic particles @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that the compaction dynamics exhibits different regimes associated to respectively grain translations and grain rotations .",
    "it has been also reported @xcite that the random packing density of spherocylinders or rods decreases when the aspect ratio @xmath9 of these objects increases .    in this paper",
    ", we present an experimental study of compaction dynamics for cylindrical particles in a vertical tubes ( figure [ im : expsetup ] ) .",
    "we investigate the volume fraction as a function of the aspect ratio of the grains @xmath9 and as function of the ratio between the grain length and the tube diameter @xmath10 .",
    "we will see that according to the ratio @xmath10 , restrictions on grain orientations appear .",
    "these restrictions have large influence on the asymptotic volume fraction",
    ".    a toy model for compaction is also proposed for the case of anisotropic grains .",
    "our experimental setup for the study of compaction is different from usual ones .",
    "indeed , an oscillating system is generally used to produce the compaction process . in our experiment , an electromagnetic hammer , which is controlled by a computer via an interface ,",
    "is placed below a vertical tube for tapping .",
    "thus , we act on the system with a series of intense and short taps .",
    "the intensity , the number and the frequency of the taps can be controlled .",
    "a ccd camera records the tube during the whole experiment .",
    "therefore , we can measure the evolution of the height @xmath11 of the granular / air interface by image analysis .",
    "a ruler is placed along the tube in order to calibrate the measurements . the picture analysis for the volume fraction measurements",
    "is made by an algorithm especially developed for this task .",
    "on the pictures , grains appear in dark and the rest of the system appears in bright .",
    "an average of the pixel values is performed on the vertical of the picture .",
    "we obtain an abrupt variation of the average at the position of the granular / air interface .",
    "the maximum of the first derivative gives the position of the interface .",
    "the volume fraction @xmath3 is estimated through the value of @xmath11 , the density of grains and the weight of the entire column .",
    "one should note that in our experiment , we are mainly interested on the volume fraction averaged over the entire granular column . a sketch of our setup is given in figure [ im : expsetup ] .",
    "the granular material we used is made of identical cylinders .",
    "the diameter @xmath12 of these cylinders is 1.2 mm and their length varies between 2 mm and 26 mm .",
    "their aspect ratio @xmath9 varies between 1.6 and 21 .",
    "the cylinders are placed in a vertical glass tube .",
    "the internal diameter @xmath1 of the glass tube can vary between 8 mm and 24 mm .    for the preparation of the loose packing ,",
    "grains are poured in the glass tube with a funnel before each run .",
    "we have also tested a decompaction by inflating air from the bottom of the tube .",
    "this does not change our results obtained with the rain method .    in order to obtain a saturation of the volume fraction when tapping ,",
    "a minimum of 2000 taps was applied before stopping each experiment .    before investigating the compaction dynamics ,",
    "let us present some additional information about tapping .",
    "we have measured the acceleration experienced by the bottom of the glass tube after each tap .",
    "the analysis of a single tap with an ultrafast camera gives a typical acceleration of 12 @xmath13 during a short period of 2 ms .",
    "the amplitude of the vertical motion is approximately 0.25 mm .",
    "we have also measured the relaxation time of the system after a tap ( the time after which there is no movement in the tube ) .",
    "we obtained at most 0.12 s. in all our experiments , the successive taps are always separated by at least 0.2 seconds .",
    "this time interval is long enough to avoid any overlap between relaxation mechanisms provoked by two successive taps .",
    "we have analysed the compaction for different tube diameters @xmath1 and for different lengths @xmath0 of the rods .",
    "the figure [ im : expcompcurve ] presents typical curves of compaction for three different lengths .",
    "each curve is well fitted by the inverse logarithmic law of eq([eq : empirical ] ) .",
    "curves obtained in other glass tubes present similar behaviors .",
    "we do not observe different stages in the compaction process as in @xcite .",
    "in fact , several stages have been observed for a vertical acceleration less than @xmath14 . in our experiment ,",
    "the dimensionless acceleration is much larger ( @xmath15 ) as underlined here - before .     as a function of the tap number @xmath4 .",
    "the curves are fits using eq .",
    "( [ eq : empirical ] ) .",
    "three different cases are illustrated : @xmath0 = 4 mm ( squares ) , @xmath0 = 10 mm ( circles ) and @xmath0 = 20 mm ( triangles ) for d = 10 mm . ]",
    "all experimental compaction curves have been fitted with the inverse logarithmic law , i.e. with eq.(1 ) . from the fits ,",
    "a relevant parameter is the asymptotic volume fraction @xmath6 .",
    "the figure [ im : expdensfin ] shows the asymptotic volume fraction @xmath6 as a function of the ratio @xmath10 for different tube diameters .",
    "the asymptotic volume fraction presents large variations when the ratio @xmath10 is changed . in all experiments ,",
    "we observe a minimum of @xmath16 when the cylinder length is equal to the tube diameter , i.e. when @xmath17 . from these results",
    ", one could ask whether the compaction dynamics changes or not when varying @xmath10 .     as a function of the ratio @xmath10 for three different tube diameters : @xmath1= 8 mm ( squares ) , @xmath1 = 10 mm ( circles ) and @xmath1 = 12 mm ( triangles ) .",
    "error bars are indicated . ]    while the asymptotic volume fraction of the packing does not vary much with @xmath1 for both extreme cases @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the situation is quite different for the particular case @xmath17 . in that case , the asymptotic volume fraction @xmath6 decreases when the tube diameter @xmath1 increases .",

    "error bars are indicated .",
    "the curve is only a guide for the eyes ]      as for common liquid cristals , the rods have two parameters for describing a possible long - range order : position and orientation .",
    "each of them plays a role in the packing fraction . since",
    "random positions are usually observed even for spherical grains , the largest source of heterogeneities in our experiment comes from grain orientations .",
    "the orientation disorder is reduced when @xmath23 .",
    "one should also note that the vertical configurations which are favored by the geometrical constraints do not correspond to energy minimization .",
    "indeed , the potential energy for a grain is minimized when this grain is horizontal .",
    "three different cases are illustrated : ( a ) @xmath0 = 4 mm , ( b ) @xmath0 = 10 mm , ( c ) @xmath0 = 20 mm . ]",
    "figure [ im : compdiffgrainsexp ] presents typical pictures of the packing for various ratios @xmath10 .",
    "the pictures were taken after several taps . from the observation of the left picture shown in figure",
    "[ im : compdiffgrainsexp ] , one understands that all grain orientations are possible for @xmath24 . in that case , the ideal packing could be realized in various directions . for @xmath25 ,",
    "horizontal orientations are forbidden .",
    "the grains are ideally arranged along the tube direction , i.e. along the vertical direction .",
    "this global ordering of the grains is well seen on the right picture of figure [ im : compdiffgrainsexp ] .",
    "when @xmath26 , a few grains are placed in the horizontal direction .",
    "large voids can be seen near horizontal grains .",
    "this case is shown in the central picture of figure [ im : compdiffgrainsexp ] .",
    "the large variation of the packing fraction , which is observed when the needle length @xmath0 is equivalent to the tube diameter @xmath1 , should be attributed to a 3d-2d transition .",
    "let us discuss some particular cases . for @xmath27",
    ", the situation tends to a packing of isotropic objects .",
    "the 3d ideal volume fraction of identical spheres is @xmath28 while the random close packed limit is @xmath29 , i.e. a value close to what we have measured for the smaller grains . in the case of long needles ( @xmath30 ) ,",
    "all needles have a vertical orientation .",
    "the ideal volume fraction is given by the fraction of disks arranged along a hexagonal packing in the plane crossing the glass tube , i.e. @xmath31 . of course , this ideal ordered packing is never realized .",
    "the random case corresponds to a packing fraction @xmath32 which is the upper limit of our experimental measurements .    from the above discussion on both extreme cases ,",
    "one expects a global increase of the volume fraction from 0.58 ( random sphere packing ) to 0.82 ( random disk packing ) when the ratio @xmath10 increases . how to explain that volume fraction presents a minimum for @xmath33 ? this minimum is the consequence of the competition between two phenomenons .",
    "first , the packing density decreases when the aspect ratio of grain @xmath9 increases @xcite .",
    "secondly , we observe an arrangement of grains along the tube direction when @xmath34 .",
    "this arrangement leads to an increase of the packing density .",
    "the first phenomenon explains the decrease of @xmath6 for @xmath10 situated between 0.2 and 1 .",
    "the second phenomenon explains the increase of @xmath6 for @xmath10 situated between 1 and 2 .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath33 , some horizontal grains can block the vertical motion of the other grains and form jams .    in figure",
    "[ im : expdensfinleqd ] the minimum value of @xmath6 is found to decrease with @xmath0 ( = @xmath1 ) .",
    "this decrease is explained by the increase of the aspect ratio @xmath9 and by the presence of jams when a grain is horizontal .",
    "in order to reproduce our experimental results , we propose a toy model on a 2d lattice .",
    "grains are needles having different orientations .",
    "they are placed on a square lattice .",
    "each grain has 8 different possible orientations which are illustrated in figure 7 .",
    "lattice boundaries are closed .",
    "the length @xmath0 of the needles is a parameter to be investigated .",
    "the width @xmath35 of the lattice is the second parameter of the toy model .     on a square lattice .",
    "]    the first step of the model consists in filling the lattice with anisotropic grains .",
    "the first configuration is obtained by the rain method .",
    "grains are dropped sequentially on the top of the lattice .",
    "both grain position and grain orientation are chosen randomly .",
    "the grains follow a vertical motion until they touch another particle or the lattice edge .    once the lattice is filled , the model consists in applying a series of taps .",
    "the procedure to simulate a single tap is the following .",
    "we randomly choose some grains as many times as the number of grains in the system .",
    "thus , every grain in the system has a chance to move . for a selected grain",
    ", we have the choice between two motions : rotation or translation .",
    "the selected motion for that grain has also two possible directions .",
    "each motion and each direction is chosen randomly with a probability @xmath36 .",
    "the operation is executed only if it does not lead to some overlap of the grains .",
    "the volume fraction @xmath3 of the packing is measured after every tap .",
    "it should be also underlined that this toy model does not consider the gravity when randomly selecting new orientations for the needles .",
