    "the celebrated lenz - ising model is one of the simplest systems exhibiting an order  disorder transition .",
    "it was introduced by lenz in @xcite , and his student ising proved @xcite in his phd thesis the absence of phase transition in dimension one , wrongly conjecturing the same picture in higher dimensions .",
    "this belief was widely shared , and motivated heisenberg to introduce his model @xcite . however , some years later peierls @xcite used estimates on the length of interfaces between spin clusters to disprove the conjecture , showing a phase transition in the two dimensional case .",
    "after kramers and wannier @xcite derived the value of the critical temperature and onsager @xcite analyzed behavior of the partition function for the ising model on the two - dimensional square lattice , it became an archetypical example of the phase transition in lattice models and in statistical mechanics in general , see @xcite for the history of its rise to prominence .",
    "over the last six decades , thousands of papers were written about the ising model , with most of the literature , including this paper , restricted to the two dimensional case ( similar behavior is expected in three dimensions , but for now the complete description remains out of reach ) .",
    "the partition function and other parameters were computed exactly in several different ways , usually on the square lattice or other regular graphs .",
    "it is thus customary to say that _",
    "the 2d ising model is exactly solvable _ , though one should remark that most of the derivations are non - rigorous , and moreover many quantities can not be derived by traditional methods .",
    "arrival of the _ renormalization group _ formalism ( see @xcite for a historical exposition ) led to an even better physical understanding , albeit still non - rigorous .",
    "it suggests that block - spin renormalization transformation ( coarse - graining , i.e. , replacing a block of neighboring sites by one ) corresponds to appropriately changing the scale and the temperature .",
    "the kramers - wannier critical point arises then as a fixed point of the renormalization transformations , with the usual picture of stable and unstable directions .",
    "in particular , under simple rescaling the ising model at the critical temperature should converge to a _ scaling limit _  a `` continuous '' version of the originally discrete ising model , which corresponds to a quantum field theory .",
    "this leads to the idea of _ universality _ : the ising models on different regular lattices or even more general planar graphs belong to the same renormalization space , with a unique critical point , and so at criticality the scaling limit and the scaling dimensions of the ising model should be independent of the lattice ( while the critical temperature depends on it ) .",
    "being unique , the scaling limit at the critical point is _ translation _ and _ scale invariant _ , which allows to deduce some information about correlations @xcite . by additionally postulating invariance under inversions ,",
    "one obtains _",
    "mbius invariance _ , i.e. invariance under global conformal transformations of the plane , which allows @xcite to deduce more . in seminal papers",
    "@xcite belavin , polyakov and zamolodchikov suggested much stronger _ full conformal invariance _",
    "( under all conformal transformations of subregions ) , thus generating an explosion of activity in conformal field theory , which allowed to explain non - rigorously many phenomena , see @xcite for a collection of the founding papers of the subject",
    ". note that in the physics literature there is sometimes confusion between the two notions , with mbius invariance often called conformal invariance , though the latter is a much stronger property .    over the last 25 years our physical understanding of the 2d critical lattice models has greatly improved , and the universality and conformal invariance are widely accepted by the physics community . however , supporting arguments are largely non - rigorous and some even lack physical motivation .",
    "this is especially awkward in the case of the ising model , which indeed admits many exact calculations .",
    "the goal of this paper is to construct lattice holomorphic fermions and to show that they have a universal conformally invariant scaling limit .",
    "we give unambiguous ( and mathematically rigorous ) arguments for the existence of the scaling limit , its universality and conformal invariance for some observables for the 2d ising model at criticality , and provide the framework to establish the same for all observables . by conformal invariance",
    "we mean not the mbius invariance , but rather the _ full conformal invariance _ , or invariance under conformal transformations of subregions of @xmath0 .",
    "this is a much stronger property , since conformal transformations form an infinite dimensional pseudogroup , unlike the mbius ones .",
    "working in subregions necessarily leads us to consider the ising model in domains with appropriate boundary conditions .    at present",
    "we can not make rigorous the renormalization approach , but we hope that the knowledge gained will help to do this in the future .",
    "rather , we use the integrable structure to construct _ discrete holomorphic fermions _ in the ising model . for simplicity",
    "we work with discrete holomorphic functions , defined e.g. on the graph edges , which when multiplied by the @xmath1 field become fermions or spinors .",
    "those functions turn out to be discrete holomorphic solutions of a discrete version of the riemann - hilbert boundary value problem , and we develop appropriate tools to show that they converge to their continuous counterparts , much as courant , friedrichs and lewy have done in @xcite for the dirichlet problem .",
    "the continuous versions of our boundary value problems are @xmath1-covariant , and conformal invariance and universality then follow , since different discrete conformal structures converge to the same universal limit .",
    "starting from these observables , one can construct new ones , describe interfaces by the schramm s sle  curves , and prove and improve many predictions originating in physics . moreover , our techniques work off criticality , and lead to _ massive _ field theories and sles .",
    "several possible developments will be the subject of our future work @xcite .",
    "we will work with the family of _ isoradial graphs _ or equivalently _",
    "rhombic lattices_. the latter were introduced by duffin @xcite in late sixties as ( perhaps ) the largest family of graphs for which the cauchy - riemann operator admits a nice discretization .",
    "they reappeared recently in the work of mercat @xcite and kenyon @xcite , as isoradial graphs  possibly the largest family of graphs were the ising and dimer models enjoy the same integrability properties as on the square lattice : in particular , the critical point is well defined , with weights depending only on the local structure .",
    "more recently , boutilier and de  tilire @xcite used the fisher representation of the ising model by dimers and kenyon s techniques to calculate , among other things , free energy for the ising model on isoradial graphs . while their work is closely related to ours",
    "( we can too use the fisher representation instead of the vertex operators to construct holomorphic fermions ) , they work in the full plane and so do not address conformal invariance .",
    "note that earlier eight vertex and ising models were considered by baxter @xcite on @xmath2-invariant graphs , arising from planar line arrangements .",
    "those graphs are topologically the same as the isoradial graphs , and the choice of weights coincides with ours , so quantities like partition function would coincide .",
    "kenyon and schlenker @xcite have shown that such graphs admit isoradial embeddings , but those change the conformal structure , and one does not expect conformal invariance for the ising model on general @xmath2-invariant graphs .",
    "so there are two reasons for our choice of this particular family : firstly it seems to be the largest family where the ising model we are about to study is nicely defined , and secondly ( and perhaps not coincidentally ) it seems to be the largest family of graphs where our main tools , the discrete complex analysis , works well .",
    "it is thus natural to consider this family of graphs in the context of _ conformal invariance _ and _ universality _ of the 2d ising model scaling limits .",
    "the fermion we construct for the random cluster representation of the ising model on domains with two marked boundary points is roughly speaking given by the probability that the interface joining those points passes through a given edge , corrected by a complex weight .",
    "the fermion was proposed in @xcite for the square lattice ( see also independent @xcite for its physical connections , albeit without discussion of the boundary problem and covariance ) .",
    "the fermion for the spin representation is somewhat more difficult to construct , it corresponds to the partition function of the ising model with a @xmath3 monodromy at a given edge , again corrected by a complex weight .",
    "we describe it in terms of interfaces , but alternatively one can use a product of order and disorder operators at neighboring site and dual site , or work with the inverse kasteleyn s matrix for the fisher s dimer representation . it was introduced in @xcite , although similar objects appeared earlier in kadanoff and ceva @xcite ( without complex weight and boundary problem discussions ) and in mercat @xcite ( again without discussion of boundary problem and covariance ) .",
    "complex analysis on isoradial graphs is more complicated then on the square grid , and less is known a priori about the ising model there . as a result parts of our paper",
    "are quite technical , so we would recommend reading the much easier square lattice proofs @xcite , as well as the general exposition @xcite first .      over the last decade ,",
    "conformal invariance of the scaling limit was established for a number of critical lattice models .",
    "an up - to - date introduction can be found in @xcite , so we will only touch the question of universality here .",
    "spectacular results of kenyon on conformal invariance of the dimer model , see e.g. @xcite , were originally obtained on the square lattice .",
    "some were extended to the isoradial case by de tilire @xcite , but the questions of boundary conditions and hence conformal invariance were not addressed yet .",
    "kenyon s dimer results had corollaries @xcite for the uniform spanning tree ( and the loop erased random walk ) .",
    "those used the temperley bijection between dimer and tree configurations on two coupled graphs , so they would extend to the situations where boundary conditions can be addressed and temperley bijection exists .",
    "lawler , schramm and werner used in @xcite simpler observables to establish conformal invariance of the scaling limit of the ust interfaces and the lerw curves , and to identify them with schramm s sle curves . in both cases",
    "one can obtain observables using the random walk , and for the ust one can use the kirchhoff circuit laws to obtain discrete holomorphic quantities .",
    "the original paper deals with the square lattice only , but it easily generalizes whenever boundary conditions can be addressed .    in all those cases we have to deal with convergence of solutions of the dirichlet or neumann boundary value problems to their continuous counterparts . while this is a standard topic on regular lattices , there are technical difficulties on general graphs ; moreover functions are unbounded ( e.g. observable for the lerw is given by the poisson kernel ) , so controlling their norm is far from trivial . tools developed by us in @xcite for use in the current paper however resolve most of such difficulties .",
    "situation is somewhat easier with the observables for the harmonic explorer and discrete gaussian free field , as discussed by schramm and sheffield @xcite  both are harmonic and solving dirichlet problem with bounded boundary values , so the generalization from the original triangular lattice is straight - forward .",
    "note though that the key difficulty in the dgff case is to establish the martingale property of the observable .",
    "unlike the observables above , the one used for percolation in @xcite is very specific to the triangular lattice , so the question of universality is far from being resolved .",
    "all the observables introduced so far ( except for the fermions from this paper ) are essentially bosonic , either invariant under conformal transformations @xmath4 or changing like `` pre - pre - schwarzian '' forms , i.e. by an addition of @xmath5 .",
    "they all satisfy dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions , when establishing convergence is a classical subject , dating back to courant , friedrichs and lewy @xcite , albeit in the non - bounded case one meets serious difficulties .    in the ising case we work with fermions , hence the riemann - hilbert boundary value problem ( or rather its homogeneous version due to riemann ) .",
    "such problems turn out to be much more complicated already on regular lattices : near rough boundaries ( which arise naturally since interfaces are fractal ) our observables blow up fast .",
    "when working on general graphs , the main problem remains , but the tools become quite limited .",
    "we believe that further progress in other models requires the study of holomorphic parafermions @xcite , so we expect even more need to address the riemann boundary value problems in the future .      throughout the paper",
    ", we work with isoradial graphs or , equivalently , rhombic lattices .",
    "a planar graph @xmath6 embedded in @xmath0 is called @xmath7-_isoradial _ if each face is inscribed into a circle of a common radius @xmath7 .",
    "if all circle centers are inside the corresponding faces , then one can naturally embed the dual graph @xmath8 in @xmath0 isoradially with the same @xmath7 , taking the circle centers as vertices of @xmath8 .",
    "the name _ rhombic lattice _ is due to the fact that all quadrilateral faces of the corresponding bipartite graph @xmath9 ( having @xmath10 as vertices and radii of the circles as edges ) are rhombi with sides of length @xmath7 .",
    "we denote the set of rhombi centers by @xmath11 ( example of an isoradial graph is drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : isograph]a ) .",
    "we also require the following mild assumption :    _ the rhombi angles are uniformly bounded away from _",
    "@xmath12 _ and _",
    "@xmath13    ( in other words , all these angles belong to @xmath14 $ ] for some fixed @xmath15 ) .",
    "below we often use the notation _ const _ for absolute positive constants that do nt depend on the mesh @xmath7 or the graph structure but , in principle , may depend on @xmath16 .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath17 which means that a double - sided estimate @xmath18 holds true for some @xmath19 which are independent of @xmath7 .",
    "it is known that one can define the ( critical ) ising model on @xmath8 so that    1 .",
    "the  interaction constants @xmath20 are local ( namely , depend on the lengths of edges connecting @xmath21 , @xmath22 , only ) and 2 .",
    "the model is invariant under the star - triangle transform .",
    "such invariance is widely recognized as the crucial sign of the integrability .",
    "note that the star - triangle transform preserves the isoradial graph / rhombic lattice structure .",
    "moreover , isoradial graphs form the largest family of planar graphs ( embedded into @xmath0 ) satisfying these properties ( see @xcite and references therein ) . at the same time",
    ", discrete holomorphic functions on isoradial graphs provide the simplest example of a discrete integrable system in the so - called `` consistency approach '' to the ( discrete ) integrable systems theory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , it was understood ( see @xcite ) that some objects coming from the theoretical physics approach to the ising model ( namely , products of order and disorder operators with appropriate complex weights ) can be considered and dealt with as discrete holomorphic _ functions _ ( see sect .",
    "[ sectshol ] for further discussion ) .",
    "these functions ( which we call _ basic observables _ or _ holomorphic fermions _ ) provide a powerful tool for rigorous proofs of several results concerning the conformal invariance of the critical 2d ising model . implementing the program proposed and started in @xcite for the square grid , in this paper we mainly focus our attention on the topologically simplest case , when the model is defined in the simply - connected ( discrete ) domain @xmath23 having two marked boundary points @xmath24 ( but see section  [ sectfk4points ] for more involved setup ) .",
    "we have to mark some boundary points so that the conformal modulus is non - trivial , allowing us to construct conformal invariants .",
    "we will work with two representations of the ising model : the usual spin , as well as the random cluster ( fortuin - kasteleyn ) .",
    "the observables are similar , but do not directly follow from each other , and require slightly different approaches . in either case",
    "there is an interface ( between spin clusters or random clusters )  a discrete curve @xmath25 running from @xmath26 to @xmath27 inside @xmath23 ( see section  [ sectfkising ] ,  [ sectspinising ] for precise definitions ) . in both cases",
    "the basic observables are _ martingales _ with respect to ( filtration induced by ) the interface grown progressively from @xmath26 , which opens the way to identify its scaling limit as a schramm s sle curve , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the interface in the random cluster representation can in principle pass through some point twice , but with our setup we move apart those passages , so that the curve becomes simple and when arriving at the intersection it is always clear how to proceed .",
    "this setup is unique where the martingale property holds , so there is only one conformally invariant way to address this problem .",
    "note that the resulting scaling limit , the @xmath28 curve , will have double points .",
    "a similar ambiguity arises in the spin model ( when , e.g. a vertex is surrounded by four spins `` @xmath29 '' ) , but regardless of the way to address it ( e.g. deterministic , like always turning right , or probabilistic , like tossing a coin every time ) the martingale property always holds , and so the @xmath30 is the scaling limit .",
    "the latter is almost surely simple , so we conclude that the double points in the discrete case produce only very small loops , disappearing in the scaling limit .",
    "the first two results of our paper say that , in both representations , the holomorphic fermions are uniformly close to their continuous _ conformally invariant _ counterparts , independently of the structure of @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) and the shape of @xmath23 ( in particular , we do nt use any smoothness assumptions concerning the boundary ) .",
    "namely , we prove the following two theorems , formulated in detail as theorems [ thmfkconvergence ] and [ thmspinconvergence ] :    let discrete domains @xmath33 with two marked boundary points @xmath24 approximate some continuous domain @xmath34 as @xmath35",
    ". then , uniformly on compact subsets of @xmath36 and independently of the structure of @xmath32 , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the discrete holomorphic fermion and @xmath39 denotes the conformal mapping from @xmath36 onto the strip @xmath40 such that @xmath41 are mapped to @xmath42 .    and",
    "let discrete domains @xmath33 approximate some continuous domain @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",
    "then , uniformly on compact subsets of @xmath36 and independently of the structure of @xmath31 , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the discrete holomorphic fermion and @xmath45 is the conformal mapping such that @xmath46 and @xmath47 are mapped to @xmath48 and @xmath12 , appropriately normalized at @xmath47 .",
    "because of the aforementioned martingale property , these results are sufficient to prove the _ convergence of interfaces to conformally invariant schramm s sle curves _",
    "( in our case , @xmath30 for the spin representation and @xmath28 for the fk representation ) in the weak topology given by the convergence of driving forces in the loewner equation , cf",
    "a priori this is very far from establishing convergence of curve themselves , but we use techniques of @xcite to prove this stronger convergence in @xcite .    the third result shows how our techniques can be used to find the ( conformally invariant ) limit of some macroscopic quantities , `` staying on the discrete level '' , i.e. without consideration of the limiting curves .",
    "namely , we prove a _ crossing probability formula _ for the critical fk - ising model on isoradial graphs , analogous to cardy s formula @xcite for critical percolation and formulated in detail as theorem  [ thmfk4points ] :    let discrete domains @xmath49 with alternating ( wired / free / wired / free ) boundary conditions on four sides approximate some continuous topological quadrilateral @xmath50 as @xmath35",
    ". then the probability of an fk cluster crossing between two wired sides has a scaling limit , which depends only on the conformal modulus of the limiting quadrilateral , and is given for the half - plane by @xmath51 . \\ ] ]    the version of this formula for multiple sles was derived by bauer , bernard and kytl in @xcite , see page 1160 , their notation for the modulus related to ours by @xmath52 . besides being of an independent interest",
    ", this result together with @xcite is needed to improve the topology of convergence of fk - ising interfaces .",
    "curiously , the ( macroscopic ) answer for a unit disc @xmath53 formally coincides with the relative weights corresponding to two possible crossings inside ( microscopic ) rhombi ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fkdomain]a ) in the critical model ( see remark  [ remfk4pointsdisc ] ) .",
    "we begin with the definition of fortuin - kasteleyn ( random cluster ) and spin representations of the critical ising model on isoradial graphs in section  [ sectmodel ] . from the outset we work with critical interactions , but in principle one can introduce a temperature parameter , which would lead to _ massive holomorphic fermions_. we also introduce the basic discrete holomorphic observables ( holomorphic fermions ) satisfying the martingale property with respect to the growing interface and , essentially , show that they satisfy discrete version of the cauchy - riemann equation ( proposition  [ propfkfermiondef ] and proposition  [ propspinfermionhol ] ) using some simple combinatorial bijections between the sets of configurations .",
    "actually , we show that our observables satisfy the stronger `` two - points '' equation which we call _ spin _ or _ strong holomorphicity _ , or simply _ s - holomorphicity_.    we discuss the properties of s - holomorphic functions in section  [ sectsholfunct ] .",
    "the main results are :    1 .   the ( rather miraculous ) possibility to define naturally the discrete version of @xmath54 , see proposition [ prophdef ] .",
    "note that the square @xmath55 of a discrete holomorphic function @xmath56 is not discrete holomorphic anymore , but unexpectedly it satisfies `` half '' of the cauchy - riemann equations , making its imaginary part a closed form with a well - defined integral ; 2 .",
    "the sub- and super - harmonicity of @xmath57 on the original isoradial graph @xmath6 and its dual @xmath8 , respectively , and the a priori comparability of the components @xmath58 and @xmath59 which allows one to deal with @xmath57 as with a harmonic function : e.g. nonnegative @xmath57 s satisfy a version of the harnack lemma ( see section  [ sectharnackh ] ) ; 3 .",
    "the uniform ( w.r.t . @xmath7 and the structure of the isoradial graph / rhombic lattice @xmath60 ) boundedness and , moreover",
    ", uniform lipschitzness of s - holomorphic functions inside their domains of definition @xmath23 , with the constants depending on @xmath61 and the distance @xmath62 only ( theorem  [ fboundh ] , these results should be considered as discrete analogous of the standard estimates from the classical complex analysis ) ; 4 .   the combinatorial trick ( see section  [ sectbmodtrick ] ) that allows us to transform the discrete version of the riemann - type boundary condition @xmath63 into the dirichlet condition for @xmath64 on both @xmath6  and  @xmath8 , thus completely avoiding the reference to onsager s magnetization estimate used in @xcite to control the difference @xmath65 on the boundary .    we prove the ( uniform ) convergence of the basic observable in the fk - ising model to its continuous counterpart in section  [ sectfkobservable ] .",
    "the main result here is theorem  [ thmfkconvergence ] , which is the technically simplest of our main theorems , so the reader should consider the proof as a basic example of the application of our techniques .",
    "besides the results from @xcite and the previous sections , the important idea ( exactly as in @xcite ) is to use some compactness arguments ( in the set of all simply - connected domains equipped with the carathodory topology ) in order to derive the uniform ( w.r.t . to the shape of @xmath23 and the structure of @xmath32 ) convergence from the `` pointwise '' one .    in section  [ sectspinobservable ]",
    "we prove analogous convergence result for the holomorphic fermion defined for the spin representation of the critical ising model ( theorem  [ thmspinconvergence ] ) .",
    "there are two differences from the preceding section : the unboundedness of the ( discrete ) integral @xmath66 ( this prevents us from the immediate use of compactness arguments ) and the need to consider the normalization of our observable at the target point @xmath27 ( this is crucial for the martingale property ) . in order to handle the normalization at @xmath27",
    ", we assume that our domains @xmath23 contain a ( macroscopic ) rectangle near @xmath27 and their boundaries @xmath67 approximate the corresponding straight segment as @xmath35 . making this technical assumption",
    ", we do nt lose much generality , since the growing interface , though fractal in the limit , does nt change the shape of the domain near @xmath27 .",
    "then , we use a version of the boundary harnack principle ( proposition  [ propboundhar ] ) in order to control the values of @xmath57 in the bulk through the fixed value @xmath68 .",
    "another important technical ingredient is the universal ( w.r.t . to the structure of @xmath32 ) multiplicative normalization of our observable . loosely speaking , we define it using the value at @xmath27 of the discrete holomorphic fermion in the discrete half - plane ( see theorem  [ thmcfexists ] for further details )",
    ".    section  [ sectfk4points ] is devoted to the crossing probability formula for the fk - ising model on discrete quadrilaterals @xmath49 ( theorem  [ thmfk4points ] , see also remark  [ remfk4pointsdisc ] ) .",
    "the main idea here is to construct some discrete holomorphic in @xmath23 function whose boundary values reflect the conformal modulus of the quadrilateral .",
    "namely , in our construction , discrete functions @xmath69 approximate the imaginary part of the conformal mapping from @xmath23 onto the slit strip @xmath70\\setminus ( -\\infty+i\\vk;i\\vk]$ ] such that @xmath26 is mapped to the `` lower ''  @xmath71 , @xmath27 to  @xmath72 ; @xmath73 to the `` upper ''  @xmath71 and @xmath74 to the tip  @xmath75 .",
