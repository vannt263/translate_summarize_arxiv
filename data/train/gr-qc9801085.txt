    "the goal of this work is to understand the role of a class of static , spherically - symmetric solutions of the nonsymmetric gravitational theory  @xcite ( ngt ) , which are also solutions to einstein s unified field theory  @xcite ( uft ) . in section  [",

    "this provides some motivation for studying this sector ; considered on its own it suffers from neither the bad asymptotic behaviour noted in  @xcite nor the linearization instability discussed in  @xcite , and is reproduced by many of the nonsymmetric field actions .",
