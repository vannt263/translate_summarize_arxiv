    "one of the major motivations for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) is to resolve the hierarchy and fine - tuning problems between the electroweak scale and the planck scale .",
    "supersymmetric theories introduce an extended space - time symmetry and quadratically divergent quantum corrections are canceled due to the symmetry between the bosonic and fermionic partners .",
    "this naturally stabilizes the electroweak scale against the large corrections in the ultra - violet ( uv ) regime .",
    "technicolor theories introduce new strong dynamics at scales not much above the electroweak scale , thus defer the hierarchy problem .",
    "theories with tev scale quantum gravity reinterpret the problem completely by lowering the fundamental planck scale .",
    "current and future collider experiments will provide hints to tell us which may be the ultimately correct path .",
    "recently , there has been a new formulation for the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking , dubbed the  little higgs \" models @xcite . the key ideas of the little higgs theory may be summarized by the following points :    * the higgs fields are goldstone bosons @xcite , associated with some global symmetry breaking at a higher scale @xmath4 ; * the higgs fields acquire a mass and become pseudo - goldstone bosons via symmetry breaking ( possibly radiatively ) at the electroweak scale ; * the higgs fields remain light , being protected by the approximate global symmetry and free from 1-loop quadratic sensitivity to the cutoff scale @xmath4 .    the scalar mass in a generic quantum field theory will receive quadratically divergent radiative corrections all the way up to the cut - off scale .",
    "the little higgs model solves this problem by eliminating the lowest order contributions via the presence of a partially broken global symmetry .",
    "the non - linear transformation of the higgs fields under this global symmetry prohibits the existence of a higgs mass term of the form @xmath5 .",
    "this can also be illustrated in a more intuitive way : besides the standard model gauge bosons , there are a set of heavy gauge bosons with the same gauge quantum numbers .",
    "the gauge couplings to the higgs bosons are patterned in such a way that the quadratic divergence induced by the sm gauge boson loops are canceled by the quadratic divergence induced by the heavy gauge bosons at one loop level .",
    "one also introduces a heavy fermionic state which couples to the higgs field in a specific way , so that the 1-loop quadratic divergence induced by the top - quark yukawa coupling to the higgs boson is canceled .",
    "furthermore , extra higgs fields exist as the goldstone boson multiplets from the global symmetry breaking .    it is interesting to note that , unlike the supersymmetry relations between the bosons and fermions , the cancellations of the quadratic divergence in the little higgs model occur between particles with the same statistics : divergences due to gauge bosons are canceled by new gauge bosons and similarly for the heavy quarks .",
    "a scale less than several tev and the specification of the couplings to the higgs boson are necessary requirements for the model to avoid fine - tuning .",
    "these features could lead to distinctive experimental signatures , which is the subject for the current work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ frame ] , we lay out a concrete model as proposed in @xcite .",
    "we linearize the theory and discuss the important features . in sec .",
    "[ pheno ] , we explore the characteristic phenomenology of this model . regarding the constraints from the precision electroweak data , we explore the properties associated with the custodial @xmath0 breaking and the sources which lead to the large corrections to low - energy observables in the model .",
    "we identify the arbitrariness in particular related to the @xmath1 sector .",
    "we then outline the possible fine - tunings or directions of extensions of the model in order to evade the precision electroweak constraints .",
    "we also study the characteristic signals at the future collider experiments at the lhc and a linear collider .",
    "we summarize our results in sec .  [ summer ] .",
    "we present the detailed derivation and the feynman rules of the littlest higgs model in two appendices .",
    "an explicit model has been constructed based on the idea of the little higgs models , dubbed the ",
    "littlest higgs model \" @xcite .",
    "it begins with @xmath6 global symmetry , with a locally gauged subgroup @xmath7\\otimes [ su(2)_2\\otimes u(1)_2]$ ] .",
    "the phase transitions associated with the symmetry breaking in this model proceed in two stages :    1 .   at scale @xmath4 , the global symmetry @xmath6 is spontaneously broken down to its subgroup @xmath8 via a vev of order @xmath9 .",
    "naive dimensional analysis @xcite establishes a simple relation @xmath10 . at the same time",
    ", the gauge symmetry @xmath11 ^ 2 $ ] is also broken into its diagonal subgroup @xmath12 , identified as the sm gauge group .",
    "the global symmetry breaking leaves 14 massless goldstone bosons which transform under the electroweak gauge group as a real singlet @xmath13 , a real triplet @xmath14 , a complex doublet @xmath15 , and a complex triplet @xmath16 .",
    "the real singlet and the real triplet become the longitudinal components of the gauge bosons associated with the broken gauge groups , giving them masses of the order @xmath9 , while the complex doublet and the complex triplet remain massless at this stage .",
    "2 .   the presence of gauge and yukawa couplings that break the global @xmath8 symmetry will induce a coleman - weinberg @xcite type potential for the remaining pseudo - goldstone bosons .",
    "in particular , it will give the complex triplet a heavy mass of the order @xmath9 and give the neutral component of the complex doublet a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath17 which in turn triggers the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "before we lay out the effective field theory below the scale of @xmath4 for the littlest higgs model , we note that some matching procedure for the operators that are sensitive to physics at higher energies will eventually be needed .",
    "namely , one would need to consider the uv origin of the theory above @xmath4 .",
    "we will not attempt to explore the uv completion of the theory in this paper but rather refer the reader to some discussions in the literature @xcite .        at the scale @xmath4 ,",
    "a vev @xmath9 breaks the assumed global @xmath6 symmetry into its subgroup @xmath8 , resulting in 14 goldstone bosons . the effective field theory of those goldstone bosons is parameterized by a non - linear @xmath18-model with a gauge symmetry @xmath11 ^ 2 $ ] , spontaneously broken down to the standard model gauge group .",
    "in particular , the lagrangian will still preserve the full @xmath19 ^ 2 $ ] gauge symmetry .",

    "it turns out that the appearance of the different sign between the two @xmath43s ( or @xmath44s ) can be traced back to the unique pattern of gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "for instance , the broken generators ( associated with @xmath45 ) are @xmath46 which do not satisfy the standard @xmath0 commutation relations .",
    "technically , this is the reason for the unusual negative sign of the gauge couplings of the higgs boson to @xmath45 ( @xmath47 ) .      the electroweak symmetry breaking in this model",
