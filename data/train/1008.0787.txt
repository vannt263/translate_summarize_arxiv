    "the random velocities of disk stars in the solar neighborhood are known to increase with time since the 1940 s and this fact has been verified by recent hipparcos observations .",
    "the analysis of the hipparcos data @xcite reveals that the stellar velocity dispersions increase continuously ( rather than episodically as claimed by @xcite ) with time which is the well - known disk heating problem in our galaxy .",
    "the phenomenon of disk heating is not specific for our galaxy since the heating of stellar disks is also known to persist in external galaxies such as in ngc 2985 , ngc 2460 , and ngc 2775 @xcite .",
    "although mechanisms have been identified for the disk heating , a full understanding has yet to be achieved .",
    "it is known that disk heating is anisotropic ; that is , disk stars are preferentially heated along the plane in comparison to its perpendicular direction .",
    "thus , the main problem in disk heating is two - fold .",
    "the first is the requirement to explain the continual heating of disk stars especially in the case of isolated galaxies for which tidal heating or external perturbations can be ruled out .",
    "secondly , such a mechanism must be anisotropic in nature .",
    "taken together , disk heating remains a fundamental problem in galactic dynamics .",
    "historically , @xcite first showed that the secular increase in the stellar velocity dispersions could arise as a result of the scattering of disk stars with giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) based on two dimensional calculations .",
    "subsequently , there has been considerable development and progress in understanding the disk heating problem in galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite extended the previous theoretical work to a three dimensional disk and found that the velocity dispersions increase with time , @xmath0 , as @xmath1 where @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , it was demonstrated that transient stochastic spiral arms @xcite could also produce secular heating of the disk stars , however , such effects were only effective in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "the effect of giant molecular clouds in combination with the effect of stochastic spirals could scatter the stars off the plane @xcite to account for both the radial and vertical heating .",
    "alternatively , using an extensive orbit analysis of the stars subject to a 3d galactic bar potential , @xcite has shown that a large fraction of the phase space is chaotic and suggested that all the disk stars trapped in the chaotic phase space would be heated up in all directions .",
    "other possible candidate heating mechanisms include massive dark halo objects , e.g. black holes or dark clusters of mass @xmath3 m@xmath4 @xcite or a combination of giant molecular clouds and halo black holes @xcite . within the framework of standard cosmological models , a spectrum of subhalos and their substructures could heat up the disk @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite found that the subhalos are not efficient perturbers for disk heating because the orbits of the subhalos rarely take them near the disk .",
    "finally , satellite infall onto the galactic disk could produce an abrupt heating of the disk @xcite or moderate heating could arise due to sinking satellites on prograde orbits @xcite .",
    "the many possible heating mechanisms of the disk stars has been reviewed by @xcite .",
    "note that while most mechanisms produce radial heating of the disk stars they have not been shown to provide a satisfactory explanation of the detailed nature of vertical heating .",
    "in fact , studies focusing on the vertical heating are comparatively lacking .",
    "to be more precise , a generic and robust internal source remains to be identified which could be responsible for the continual vertical heating of the disk .",
    "here , we primarily concentrate on the issue of vertical disk heating . galactic disks often consist of various non - axisymmetric patterns such as bars , spirals , warps , corrugations , and rings .",
    "these patterns may be growing or transient and , in general , may be time - dependent .",
    "it is natural to ask whether such patterns contribute to the disk vertical heating .",
    "that is , what is the nature of vertical heating due , for example , to a growing bar ?",
    "how does a growing bar heat the disk stars in the vertical direction ?",
    "heating due to non - axisymmetric patterns are important for isolated galaxies as even for the milky way , there are prominent and characteristic signatures of non - axisymmetric patterns @xcite in the phase space in the solar neighbourhood .    in this paper , we explore possible mechanisms giving rise to continuous heating of the disk stars in the vertical direction . in particular , we show that stellar bars that are formed nearly spontaneously in disk galaxies are capable of efficiently scattering stars in the vertical direction .",
    "since transient spiral arms are often associated with bars , they also contribute to the disk heating . in order to understand the nature of vertical heating of the disk stars",

    "each model galaxy consists of a bulge , disk and dark matter halo as described above .",

    "hence , bar formation appears to be quite common and generic in disk galaxies and a live dark matter halo plays a significant role . as shown by @xcite a live dark matter halo supports , rather than suppresses , the bar instability in the disk .",
    "in contrast , bar formation in the disk could be suppressed in the presence of a non - responsive rigid dark matter halo @xcite .",

    "for example , recent work by @xcite has shown that the buckling instability weakens the bar and the resulting peanut shaped phase lasts for several gyrs in their simulation .",

    "a similar anti - correlation between the bar growth and pattern speed evolution has been discussed by @xcite and more recently by @xcite . however , there are also the normal cases where the pattern speed decreases with time , while the bar grows to a higher amplitude , by losing angular momentum to the halo via dynamical friction .",
    "we notice that the bar growth is slow ( typically a factor of @xmath52 to @xmath97 less ) in cases where the pattern speed is observed to remain nearly constant in time .",

    "<S> the nature of vertical heating of disk stars in the inner as well as the outer region of disk galaxies is studied . the galactic bar ( which is the strongest non - axisymmetric pattern in the disk ) </S>",
    "<S> is shown to be a potential source of vertical heating of the disk stars in the inner region . </S>",
    "<S> using a nearly self - consistent high - resolution n - body simulation of disk galaxies , the growth rate of the bar potential is found to be positively correlated with the vertical heating exponent in the inner region of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we also characterize the vertical heating in the outer region where the disk dynamics is often dominated by the presence of transient spiral waves and mild bending waves . </S>",
    "<S> our simulation results suggest that the non - axisymmetric structures are capable of producing the anisotropic heating of the disk stars . </S>"
