    "in our previous paper we described a model of spin-1/2 antiferromagnet ( the so - called confederate flag or cf model ) where the fine tuning of interactions gives rise to a state with fractional quantum spin number excitations ( spinons ) @xcite .",
    "the subsequent studies ( @xcite,@xcite , @xcite and especially @xcite ) have provided a support to our results . in the original publication",
    "we did not discuss what happens if one deviates from this special point .",
    "such discussion is a subject of the present publication . here",
    "i discuss the phase diagram of cf model concentrating primarily on the vicinity of the deconfinement ( d ) point .",
    "this gives us a better understaning of the physics involved and also helps to put the cf model in the broader context of studies of frustrated magnetism .",
    "though the corresponding literature is enormous ( see , for example , @xcite for review ) , the theoretical efforts are primarily concentrated on idealized models ( such as models of dimers or gauge field theory models ) whose relation to microscopic models with realistic interactions is not clear .",
    "the standard argument invokes universality : the belief is that low energy behavior of such systems will be independent on microscopical details following some universal patterns .",
    "it is always interesting to check general considerations against concrete models . in that sense , cf model",
    ", being simply a model of a heisenberg magnet with short range interactions , presents an almost unique example .",
    "the literature knows two scenario for realization of the d - point . in one of them",
    "deconfined spinons exist on the boundary between antiferromagnetic and vbc state in the hypothetical situation when these states touch each other at a quantum critical point @xcite . in the other scenario , based on the study of models of quantum dimers ,",
    "spinons appear at the boundary between two vbc states ( the roksar - kivelson critical point ) @xcite , @xcite . as i shall argue in this paper ,",
    "neither situation is realized in cf model . in that model",
    "the d - point separates two vbc states , as in the second scenario , but the analogy does not go much further .",
    "first , according to @xcite,@xcite , the spectrum at the d - point in the dimer models consists of spinless particles ( `` photons '' ) with a quadratic @xmath2 spectrum . this is absolutely incompatible with cf model which is approximately ( 1 + 1 ) lorentz invariant when the interchain coupling is weak .",
    "this symmetry dictates that the dispersion of the gapless excitations along the chains direction must be linear .",
    "second , one of the vbc phases in the dimer models contains a devil s staircase of commensurate and incommensurate phases which does not agree with the situation in cf model where both vbc phases are simple .",
    "so it appears that cf model is quite distinct and does not fit into the known categories .",
    "the model suggested in our original paper @xcite is a spin-1/2 heisenberg magnet with spatially anisotropic exchange interactions .",
    "the exchange in one direction is much stronger than in the others and therefore this model can be viewed as a model of weakly coupled chains .",
    "recently batista and trugman @xcite have found an isotropic version of the cf model and shown that it has the same ground state degeneracy and possesses spin-1/2 excitations .",
    "therefore the requirement of the space anisotropy is only a matter of convenience .",
    "it allows us to use the continuum limit in one direction and to apply the field theory methods .",
    "the existence of the deconfined point also does not depend on the number of transverse directions , therefore for the sake of simplicity i will discuss the two - dimensional version of the model . in that case",
    "the interaction pattern reminds the confederate flag ( see fig .",
    "the cf model hamiltonian is given by h_cf = _ j , n\\{j_*s*_j , n _",
    "j+1,n + _ = 1 _ j , n + } + v_quarter,[cf ] where @xmath3 are spin-1/2 operators , and @xmath4 . the term",
    "@xmath5 contains a four-(and possibly higher ) spin exchange interaction with a small coupling constant @xmath6 .",
    "this term was absent in the original publication , but , as was recently demonstrated by balents and starykh @xcite , one needs to introduce it to fine - tune the model to the state with deconfined spinons .",
    "= 0.5    assuming that the interchain couplings ( @xmath7 ) are much smaller than the exchange along the chains ( @xmath8 ) it is legitimate to adopt a continuum description of individual chains . in this description ,",
    "the local spin densities are represented as sums of the smooth and staggered parts : _ j , n /a_0 _ n ( x ) = * m*_n(x ) + ( -1)^j*n*_n(x ) ,  x = j a_0 , [ contins ] @xmath9 being the lattice spacing in the chain direction .",
    "= 0.65    the low - energy dynamics of the spin1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet h_1d = j__j(*s*_j*s*_j + 1 ) is described by the su@xmath10(2 ) wess - zumino - novikov - witten model .",
    "the latter hamiltonian can be written in terms of the so - called chiral vector _",
    "operators , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , satisfying the level @xmath13 kac - moody algebra ( this approach has been described in a vast number of publications ; ( for a review see @xcite or @xcite,@xcite ) : h_1d x+ , [ wznw ] with @xmath14 .    it is remarkable that the smooth part of magnetization , = * j * + |*j * , [ m ] and the spin current , = v(*j * - |*j * ) , [ j ] are locally expressed in terms of the chiral currents .    in the cf model",
    ", the exchange is frustrated in the direction perpendicular to the chains . in order to eliminate the coupling of the leading relevant operators ( the staggered magnetizations @xmath15 and the dimerizations @xmath16 ) one has to fine tune the couplings @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in the leading order in @xmath19",
    "the fine tuning is achieved when @xmath20 .    to discuss the phase diagram of cf model one needs to deviate from the fine - tuned point with deconfined spinons . for weak interchain interactions one still can employ the continuum hamiltonian obtained using the continuum description of individual chains following the asymptotic representation ( [ contins ] ) of the spin operators : & & h = h_1 + h_2 , + & & h_1 = _ n = 1 ^ 2n .[model ] + & & h_2 = j _ n , * n*_n*n*_n + [ v ] where @xmath21 is given by eq.([wznw ] ) . for the lattice hamiltonian presented on fig .",
    "1 we have @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "one very important property of model ( [ model ] ) is its ( 1 + 1)-dimensional lorentz invariance which survives at @xmath24 .",
    "this dictates the form of the excitation spectrum for all particles : e^2 = v^2k^2 + ^2(k _ ) where @xmath25 is a periodic function of the wave vector component perpendicular to the chains .",
    "i emphasise that this result is valid for an arbitrary number of chains .",
    "as i have mentioned in introduction , this property precludes the existence of @xmath26 gapless modes characteristic for dimer model critical points .",
    "model ( [ model],[v ] ) can be viewed as the critical system ( the bunch of non - interacting spin-1/2 chains ) perturbed by relevant interactions .",
    "each of these interactions generate their own energy scale according to their scaling dimension .",
    "the current - current interaction , being only marginally relevant , generates the scale m ~j_[mass ] and the interaction of the staggered spin components generates a scale @xmath27 .",
    "when @xmath28 the system orders antiferromagnetically ( though in two dimensions only at @xmath29 ) .",
    "the corresponding neel wave vectors are @xmath0 for @xmath30 and @xmath1 for @xmath31 .",
    "these things are absolutely obvious ; it is less obvious however what happens in the opposite limit @xmath32 . for weak interchain interactions",
    "the best i can do in this case is to study the four chain model , where non - perturbative calculations can be carried out explicitely .",
    "i believe that the four chains are representative enough to give an insight into what happens for an infinite system .",
    "so let us consider the case of four chains with periodic boundary conditions in the transverse direction .",
    "let me briefly recall the results for @xmath33 obtained in @xcite,@xcite . as was noticed that at @xmath33 the model acquires an additional symmetry : the sectors with different parity decouple .",
    "this follows from the fact that the relevant interactions couple only currents of different chirality belonging to different chains .",
    "thus the relevant current - current interaction is ( * j*_1 + * j*_3)(|*j*_2 + |*j*_4 ) + ( * j*_2 + * j*_4)(|*j*_1 + |*j*_3 ) and the hamiltonian ( [ model ] ) decouples into two parts : h = h_+ + h_- the @xmath34 parity sector contains @xmath35 and @xmath36 currents and the @xmath37 parity sector contains @xmath38 and @xmath39 currents .",
    "each of the models represented by the hamiltonians @xmath40 is integrable , which can be demonstrated by rewriting them in terms of familiar integrable models .",
    "let us recall how it was done in @xcite .",
    "a sum of two @xmath13 su(2 ) currents is the @xmath41 current ; moreover , according to @xcite the sum of two su@xmath10(2 ) wznw models ( the central charge 2 ) can be represented as the su@xmath42(2 ) wznw model with central charge 3/2 and plus one massless majorana fermion ( a critical ising model ) with central charge 1/2 . using the results of @xcite we rewrite the entire hamiltonian density ( [ wznw ] ) as follows ( here only the ( + ) -parity part",
    "is written ) : & & h_+ = h_massless + h_massive + & & h_massless = -_0_x_0 + |_0_x|_0[ising ] + & & h_massive = ( : * i * : + : |*i*|*i * : ) + |*i * = ( - ^a_x^a + |^a_x|^a ) - ( ^a|^a)^2 [ o3 ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 _ 1,3",
    "= \\{_0 + [ ] } ,   |*j*_2,4 = \\{|_0 + [ ] } [ curr2 ] the fields @xmath45 stand for real ( majorana ) fermions",
    ".    eq.([ising ] ) describes a critical ising model ; the corresponding excitations are gapless and non - magnetic ; they appear in the sectors with both parities .",
    "let me say several words about the o(3 ) gross - neveau model ( [ o3 ] ) . though majorana fermion description presents some advantages , the staggered magnetization components as well as their product ( [ v ] ) are nonlocal with respect to these fermions .",
    "it turns out that the latter interaction can be expressed in terms of order and disorder parameter operators of the eight ising models corresponding to each majorana fermion species . since we are interested in the case when @xmath46 , we have to recast the perturbation in terms of the nonchiral fields of models @xmath40 .",
    "this can be done using abelian bosonization representation for individual chains and the correspondence between @xmath47 theory and two critical ising models ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the net result for the density of the perturbation hamiltonain obtained after some algebra is    & & h_2 = j(*n*_1 + * n*_3)(*n*_2 + * n*_4 ) = + & & j(_0^+_0 ^ -)[(_1_2_3)^+(_1_2_3)^- - 3(_1_2_3)^+(_1_2_3)^- + ... ] + + & & j(_0^+_0 ^ -)[3(_1_2_3)^+(_1_2_3)^- + ( _ 1_2_3)^+(_1_2_3)^- + ... ] [ stagint ] where the dots stand for the terms which do not have finite averages at @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 ( @xmath50 are order and disorder parameter operators of the ising models associated with the majorana fermions @xmath51 from @xmath34 and @xmath37 sectors .",
    "as we shall demonstrate later , this interaction leads to confinement of spin-1/2 particles .",
    "the dimerization order parameter is & & ( * n*_1 - * n*_3)(*n*_2 - * n*_4 ) = + & & ( _ 0^+_0 ^ -)[(_1_2_3)^+(_1_2_3)^- + 3(_1_2_3)^+(_1_2_3)^- + ... ] + + & & ( _ 0^+_0 ^ -)[- 3(_1_2_3)^+(_1_2_3)^- + ( _ 1_2_3)^+(_1_2_3)^- + ... ] [ dimer ] as i have said , the terms in the square brackets in eq.([stagint ] ) have nonzero vacuum averages even at @xmath33 . the unperturbed model has four ground states : with @xmath52 ( the @xmath53 vacua ) and @xmath54 ( the @xmath55 vacua ) . replacing in ( [ stagint ] ) the corresponding products by their vacuum expectation values @xmath56 and identifying @xmath57 , we get & & h_2 ~(j ) m^3/4   ( ^0 ) + & & ~(j ) m^3/4   ( ^0 ) [ forms ] and 0 if for one parity @xmath58 and @xmath59 for the other .",
    "thus the ground state degeneracy is now reduced to two ; the order ( disorder ) parameters in both sectors now condense simultaneously .",
    "the @xmath60 degeneracy is not lifted , since two forms of the potential ( [ forms ] ) are equivalent under the uniform shift @xmath61 which does not affect the gradient term @xmath62 .",
    "perturbation ( [ v ] ) couples the critical ising model sectors with different parity ; being projected on the state with @xmath63 the resulting hamiltonian becomes the sine - gordon one : & & h_sg =    & & [ _ 0 ^ 2 + ( _ x_0)^2 ] + a ( j ) m^3/4 ( _ 0 + ^-13 ) where @xmath64 is a numerical coefficient , @xmath65 is the pauli matrix and @xmath66 is the momentum density operator .",
    "the cosine term gives rise to the mass gap ~(j)^4/7m^3/7 [ massd ] the average dimerization is & & ( * n*_1 - * n*_3)(*n*_2 - * n*_4)= + & & ~m^3/4   ( 0 ) + & & ~- m^3/4   ( 0 ) this average does not depend on the choice of vacuum ( that is whether @xmath67 or @xmath68 are in the condensate ) : ~(j)^1/7m^6/7 thus the dimerization changes its sign when @xmath48 goes through zero following a power law dependence .",
    "the exponent is quite small and it is possible that in the limit of infinite number of chains the transition is the 1st order , as in the isotropic cf model @xcite .",
    "i believe that this is indicative of the physics behind the deconfinement : it occurs on the boundary between two valence bond crystalline orders .",
    "= 0.45    = 0.65",
    "the problem of kinks confinement in the potential ( [ stagint ] ) is somewhat peculiar differing from the standard confinement problems studied by various authors @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in our case",
    "the string tension is provided by the @xmath69 , \\sin[\\sqrt\\pi\\phi_0]$ ] terms and becomes energy dependent .",
    "though it is not directly related to the main topic of the paper , it is interesting enough on its own right .",
    "so i will spent some time discussing this problem .",
    "let us consider a kink interpolating between the @xmath67- and @xmath68-vacua in the @xmath34 sector ( @xmath70^{+}$ ] kink ) .",
    "it carries an isotopic ( spin ) index @xmath71 . according to ( [ stagint ] )",
    ", the creation of such a kink will lead to the rise of the total energy proportional to the system size . to prevent this",
    ", one has to create a similar kink in the @xmath37 sector .",
    "if we have two kinks @xmath72 - one centered at @xmath73 and the other one at @xmath74 , the effective potential for the @xmath75 field is a(j)m^3/4\\{(x_1 -x)+ ( x - x_2 ) } the kinks are heavy particles whose mass @xmath76 far exceeds the masses of excitations of the @xmath77 field @xmath78 .",
    "this justifies the approximation which takes the kink configuarations as step functions . at @xmath79 field @xmath80",
    "is locked at @xmath81 , at @xmath82 it is locked at @xmath83 .",
    "the solution in the middle is @xmath84 such that the total energy difference between the vacuum without kinks and the vacuum in the presence of two kinks is v = b^2 ^ 2|x_12| + [ potential ] where @xmath85 ( though its numerical value can be calculated , it is not of an interest here ) and b^2 ^ 2 = a ( j)m^3/4    = 0.5    this energy difference provides an effective confining double - well potential in which the @xmath70^{+}-[\\mu\\s]^{-}$ ] bound states are formed . recall that the potential does not depend on the spin configuration ( this will be no longer the case when @xmath86 ) .",
    "therefore the bound states form 4-fold degenerate isotopic multiplets consisting of su(2 ) triplets and singlets .",
    "the mass spectrum of kink bound states in such double - well potential is somewhat different from the purely linear confining potential studied in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite : & & m_n - 2 m + & & b\\ { + ^1/2(n + 1/2)[1 ( n ) ] + ... } ,   n < < ( m/)^2/5 [ spec ] where @xmath87\\ ] ] and m_n - 2 m b(n^2b / m)^1/3 ,   n > > ( m/)^2/5 [ spec1 ] not all these bound states are stable ; the particles with masses greater than @xmath88 can decay into particles with smaller masses emitting excitations of the @xmath77 field",
    ". therefore particles with @xmath89 are unstable . since the power 1/2 is quite close to 2/5",
    ", the mass sequence of eq.([spec1 ] ) is never reached .",
    "as far as kink - antikink states are concerned , for them the string potential is not repulsive , but attractive and they are expelled from the spectrum .",
    "the study of the four chain case gives reasons to believe that the infinite system has a phase diagram presented on fig .",
    "4 . the deconfinement point appears in the middle of the vbc phase , as in the dimer models considered in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the excitation spectra are different , however .",
    "the spinless modes of the dimer models have a quadratic spectrum @xmath2 ; such spectrum can not emerge in cf model due to the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional lorentz invariance .",
    "thus i conclude that the d - point of cf model belongs to a universality class different from the universality class of the roksar - kivelson critical point .    in conclusion to this paper",
    "i would like to point out a rather curious parallel between the problem of frustrated magnetism and another long standing problem of condensed matter physics , namely the problem of heavy fermion state formation in rare earth compounds . in these compounds",
    "magnetic moments of highly localized electrons belonging to rare earth ions @xmath90 shells interact with delocalized electrons from the broad conduction band .",
    "the problem is discussed in the literature in terms of competition between the kondo screening and the induced interspin interaction ( the so - called rkky interaction ) . on the formal level",
    "this competiton looks exactly like the competition between the less relevant current - current interaction in model ( [ model ] ) and the more relevant interaction of staggered magnetisations ( [ v ] ) .",
    "indeed , the energy scale generated by the kondo screening ( kondo temperature ) is exponentially small in the coupling constant as in ( [ mass ] ) and the energy scale generated by the rkky interaction is proportional to the square of the spin - fermion coupling . though one would expect that @xmath91 is always much smaller than @xmath92 , there is a vast class of materials where the kondo screening is manifest at temperatures much larger than the temperature of magnetic ordering .",
    "one possible explanation is that the rkky interaction with its oscillatory behavior , is highly frustrated which leads to cancellations similar to the one considered in this paper .",
