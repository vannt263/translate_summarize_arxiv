    "do not get close to lattice sites , where they would be deflected at large angles . the  blocking effect \" consists in a reduction of the flux of ions originating in lattice sites along symmetry axes and planes , creating what is called a  blocking dip \" in the flux of ions exiting from a thin enough crystal as a function of the angle with respect to a symmetry axis or plane .",
    "these effects were first observed in the 1960 s and are used in crystallography , in the study of lattice disorder , ion implantation , surfaces , interfaces and epitaxial layers , in measurements of short nuclear lifetimes etc . in particular , avoiding channeling is essential in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices , since ion implantation at a controlled depth is the primary technique .",
    "ion channeling in nai ( tl ) was first observed in 1973 by altman _",
    "et al . _",
    "they observed that channeled ions produce more scintillation light because they lose most of their energy via electronic stopping rather than nuclear stopping .",
    "the potential importance of the channeling effect for direct dark matter detection was first pointed out by sekiya _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and subsequently for nai ( tl ) by drobyshevski  @xcite and by the dama collaboration  @xcite .",
    "when na or i ions recoiling after a collision with a dark matter wimp ( weakly interacting massive particle ) move along crystal axes and planes , their quenching factor is approximately @xmath0 instead of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , since they give their energy to electrons .",
    "ion channeling in crystals could give rise to a daily modulation due to the preferred direction of the dark matter flux arriving on the earth .",
    "earth s daily rotation naturally changes the direction of the `` wimp wind '' with respect to the crystal axes , which produces a daily modulation in the measured recoil energy ( equivalent to a modulation of the factor @xmath3 ) .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite pointed this out for stilbene crystals , and avignone , creswick , and nussinov  @xcite for nai ( tl ) crystals , although the available estimates of the strength of these daily modulations are somewhat simplistic .",
    "my collaborators , graciela gelmini and paolo gondolo , and i  @xcite present here our analytic calculations of the channeling fraction in nai ( tl ) , si and ge crystals .",
    "our calculation is based on the classical analytic models developed in the 1960 s and 70 s , in particular by lindhard  @xcite .",
    "we use the continuum string and plane model , in which the screened thomas - fermi potential is averaged over a direction parallel to a row or a plane .",
    "this averaged potential @xmath4 is considered to be uniformly smeared along the row or plane of atoms , which is a good approximation if the propagating ion interacts with many lattice atoms in the row or plane by a correlated series of many consecutive glancing collisions with lattice atoms .",
    "just one row or plane is considered in this model .",
    "lindhard proved that for an ion propagating with kinetic energy @xmath5 , and for small angle @xmath6 between the ion s trajectory and the atomic row ( or plane ) in the direction perpendicular to the row ( or plane ) , the so called  transverse energy \" , @xmath7 is conserved .",
    "the conservation of the transverse energy provides a definition of the minimum distance of approach to the string ( or plane ) of atoms , @xmath8 , at which the trajectory of the ion makes a zero angle with the string ( or plane ) , and also of the angle @xmath9 at which the ion exits from the string ( or plane ) , i.e. far away from it where @xmath10 . in reality",
    "the furthest position from a string or plane of atoms is the middle of the channel , whose width we call @xmath11 .",
    "thus , @xmath12 channeling requires that @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the smallest possible minimum distance of approach of the propagating ion with the row ( or plane ) for a given energy @xmath5 . since the potential @xmath15 decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath16 , @xmath17 . using eq .",
    "[ eq : consetrans ] , this can be further translated into an upper bound on @xmath18 and on @xmath9 , the angle the ion makes with the string far away from it , @xmath19    @xmath20 is the maximum angle the ion can make with the string far away from it ( i.e. in the middle of the channel ) if the ion is channeled . at low enough @xmath5 , @xmath14 becomes close to @xmath21 , and the critical angle @xmath20 goes to zero .",
    "this means that there is a minimum energy below which channeling can not happen , even for ions moving initially in the middle of the channel .",
    "so far we have been considering static strings and planes , but the atoms in a crystal are actually vibrating .",
    "we use the debye model , and take into account thermal effects in the crystal through a modification of the critical distances which was found originally by morgan and van vliet  @xcite and later by hobler  @xcite to provide good agreement with simulations and data .",

    "the healpix method uses an algorithm to deal with the pixelization of data on a sphere , and it is useful to compute integrals over direction by dividing the surface of a sphere into many pixels , computing the integrand at each pixel ( i.e. each direction , see fig .",
    "[ dama](a ) ) , and finally summing up the values of all pixels over the sphere .    a channeled ion can be pushed out of a channel by an interaction with an impurity such as the atoms of tl in nai ( tl ) . here",
    "we will simply assume that if a channeled ion interacts with a tl atom it becomes dechanneled and thus it does not contribute to the fully channeled fraction any longer .",
    "we thus neglect the possibility that after the interaction the ion may reenter into a channel , either the same or another .",
    "[ dama](a ) shows the axial and planar channels of the nai crystal for incoming na ions with an energy of 50 kev .",
    "we include here only the channels with lower crystallographic indices 100 , 110 and 111 . the fraction of channeled incoming na and i ions after including dechanneling in the way just described is shown in fig .  [ dama](b ) .",
    "our results agree well with those published by the dama collaboration  @xcite , also included in the figure .",
    "the recoiling nuclei start initially from lattice sites ( or very close to them ) , thus blocking effects are important .",
    "in fact , as argued originally by lindhard  @xcite , in a perfect lattice and in the absence of energy - loss processes the probability that a particle starting from a lattice site is channeled would be zero .",
    "the argument uses statistical mechanics in which the probability of particle paths related by time - reversal is the same .",
    "thus the probability of an incoming ion to have a particular path within the crystal is the same as the probability of the same ion to move backwards along the same path  @xcite .",
    "this is what lindhard called the  rule of reversibility \" . using this rule ,",
    "since the probability of an incoming channeled ion to get very close to a lattice site is zero , the probability of the same ion to move in the time - reversed path , starting at a nuclear site and ending inside a channel , is zero too .",
    "however , any departure of the actual lattice from a perfect lattice , for example due to vibrations of the atoms in the lattice , would violate the conditions of this argument and allow for some of the recoiling lattice nuclei to be channeled , as already understood in the 70 s  @xcite .",
    "we now estimate the effect using the formalism presented so far .    for axial channels , the probability distribution function @xmath38 of the perpendicular distance to the row of the colliding atom due to thermal vibrations can be represented by a two - dimensional gaussian .",
    "the channeled fraction of nuclei with recoil energy @xmath5 making an initial angle @xmath6 with respect to the axis is given by the fraction of nuclei which can be found at a distance @xmath39 larger than minimum distance @xmath40 from the row at the moment of collision , @xmath41 figure [ fracnai - final ] shows what we consider to be our main predictions for the range expected as an upper limit to the channeling fraction in nai ( tl ) at 239 k for two different assumptions for the effect of thermal vibrations in the lattice , which depend on the value of the parameter @xmath25 used in the temperature corrected critical distances of approach .",

    "we have found that the channeling of lattice ions recoiling after a collision with a wimp is very different from the case of incident ions , and that the channeling fraction is smaller .    as argued originally by lindhard  @xcite , in a perfect lattice and in the absence of energy - loss processes , the probability that a particle starting from a lattice site is channeled would be zero",
    ". however , due to vibrations in the crystal , the atom that interacts with a wimp may be displaced from its position in a perfect lattice , and there is a non - zero probability of channeling ( as given in eq .",

    "[ fracnai - final](a ) for nai , without including dechanneling , the channeling fraction is never larger than 5% and the maximum happens at 100 s of kev .",
    "this maximum occurs because the critical distances decrease with the ion energy @xmath5 , making channeling more probable , and the critical angles also decrease with @xmath5 , making channeling less probable .",

    "this reduction may eventually prove to be too extreme and at present we do not have a better formalism to model dechanneling . with the simple model of dechanneling we used for nai , we could reproduce the channeling fractions computed by the dama collaboration ( which , however , apply to ions which start their motion close to the middle of a channel and not to the case of wimp direct detection ) .    if the values found by hobler  @xcite , and also by us above ( see fig .",
    "[ compare - data ] ) , to reproduce measured channeling angles in b and p propagating in si apply also to the propagation of si ions in si , then the case of @xmath26 should be chosen and the channeling fractions would never be larger than 0.3% .",
    "moreover , increasing the temperature of a crystal usually increases the fraction of channeled recoiling ions ( see fig .",
    "[ fracsig - difft - c1 ] ) , but not always .",
    "sometimes the opposite happens ( see fig .",
    "[ fracsig - difft - c2 ] ) .",
