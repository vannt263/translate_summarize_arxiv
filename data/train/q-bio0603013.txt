    "the dynamics of propagating fronts are fundamental in the study of the spread of advantageous alleles , species @xcite , or opinions @xcite .",
    "most notably , fisher @xcite and kolmogorov et al . @xcite first addressed the velocity characteristics of a simple front by way of a reaction - diffusion equation @xcite , which served as a one - dimensional model for the spread of a favorable gene .",
    "our study of front propagation envisions introduction of an advantageous allele or a competitively superior species through mutation within @xcite or geographic dispersal to @xcite a resident population , respectively .",
    "introductions occur rarely , and stochastically in both space and time .",
    "we have shown @xcite that the time evolution of such systems can be well described within the framework of homogeneous nucleation and growth .",
    "in particular , in two dimensions , for sufficiently large systems , the typical time scale ( lifetime ) until competitive exclusion of the weaker allele or species scales as @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the stochastic nucleation rate per unit area of the successful clusters of the better competitor and @xmath4 is the asymptotic radial velocity of the corresponding circular fronts .",
    "it is , thus , clear that the full understanding of the dependence of the lifetime on the local rates of the systems requires that of the velocity of the front separating the two alleles or species .",
    "therefore , we focus on the velocity characteristics of a two - dimensional two - species model of invasion with preemptive competition , where the invading species has a reproductive advantage over the residents .    here",
    "we study the velocity of the invading fronts of both planar and circular shapes on @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 two - dimensional lattices as a function of the reproduction and mortality rates of each species , and compare them with mean - field predictions .",
    "each lattice site can be empty or occupied by the resident or the invader .",
    "a lattice site represents the minimal amount of locally available resources which can sustain an individual .",
    "competition for resources is preemptive , and therefore an individual site can not be taken by either species until its occupant s mortality makes it available .",
    "preemptive competition is typical for plant species competing for common limiting resources @xcite .",
    "the local occupation number at site @xmath8 is @xmath9 , @xmath10 , representing the number of resident and invader species , respectively . due to the excluded volume constraint , @xmath11 , since two species can not simultaneously occupy the same site .",
    "a species can colonize open sites through _ local _ clonal propagation only .",
    "an individual of either species occupying site @xmath8 may reproduce only if one or more of its neighboring sites is empty ( here we consider nearest - neighbor interactions only ) .",
    "our unit time is one monte carlo step per site ( mcss ) during which @xmath12 sites are chosen randomly .",
    "the occupancy ( local configuration ) of a chosen site is updated based on the following transition rates .",
    "when a site is empty , it can become occupied by species @xmath13 of a neighboring site , at rate @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the individual - level reproduction rate and @xmath16 is the density of species @xmath13 around site @xmath8 ; @xmath17 is the set of nearest neighbors of site @xmath8 .",
    "if a site is occupied by an individual , it can die at rate @xmath18 ( regardless of the species ) .",
    "we summarize the local transition rules for an arbitrary site @xmath8 as @xmath19 where @xmath20 indicates whether the site is empty , or occupied by the resident , or invader species , respectively .",
    "we study the regime where @xmath21 , so that competition between the two alleles drives the dynamics and the invading species has an individual - level reproductive advantage over the resident .    for planar fronts ,",
    "we consider an @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 lattice with periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath22 direction .",
    "the direction of propagation is along the @xmath23 direction by virtue of the initial condition ; we set a flat front separating the invader species from the residents ; for simplicity , to the left ( right ) of the front , all sites are occupied by the invaders ( residents ) . as the simulation begins ,",
    "a number of individuals die in a few time steps , and in both domains , away from the front , the densities quickly relax to their  quasi - equilibrium \" value where the clonal propagation is balanced by mortality .",
    "the competition between the two species , hence , takes place in the interfacial region . throughout the simulation ,",
    "we keep track of the location of the invading front , by defining the edge as the right - most location of an individual of species 2 , for each row of our lattice .",
    "the average position of the front is then recorded for each time step , from which one can extract the front velocity .",
    "we also studied the velocity of circular fronts on an @xmath24@xmath6@xmath24 lattice , with an initial condition of a sufficiently large central cluster of the invading species ( with radius slightly larger than a critical radius @xcite ) , with all other sites occupied by the resident species .",
    "we then keep track of the time - dependent global density of the invaders , from which extracted the average radial velocity of the growing circular cluster . before discussing our simulation results ,",
    "we first consider those obtained from the mean - field equations of motion .",
    "from the above transition rates eq .",
    "( [ rates ] ) and the underlying master equation , neglecting correlations between the occupation numbers at different sites , for the ensemble - averaged local densities @xmath25@xmath26@xmath27 one obtains @xmath28 \\frac{\\alpha_i}{4}\\sum_{{\\bf x'}\\epsilon { \\rm nn}({\\bf x})}\\rho_{i}({\\bf x'},t ) \\nonumber \\\\   & - & \\mu \\rho_i({\\bf x } , t)\\ ; , \\label{mfe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath10 . for further insight",

    "only the @xmath33 fixed point is stable .",
    "thus , the motion of the invading front amounts to propagation into an unstable state @xcite , a phenomenon that has generated a vast amount of literature @xcite since the original papers by fisher @xcite and kolmogorov et al .",
    "@xcite , with applications ranging from reaction - diffusion systems @xcite , population dynamics @xcite , epidemics @xcite or opinion formation in social systems @xcite . at the level of the mean - field equations ,",

    "results from the simulations of the propagation of circular fronts closely match those of the planar fronts . a recent study",
    "@xcite has found a similar behavior in a discrete two - dimensional stochastic epidemic model .",
    "the discreteness of the individuals ( or equivalently , effective density cutoffs in a continuum description ) @xcite and noise @xcite have been shown to produce velocity characteristic drastically different from those of the mean - field equations .",
    "more precisely , advancing fronts in stochastic individual - based or particle models , which in the mean - field limit converge to a pulled front behavior , are instead  pushed \" @xcite .",
    "that is , the front velocity is determined by the full non - linearity of the frontal region , as opposed to the infinitesimally small leading edge @xcite .",
