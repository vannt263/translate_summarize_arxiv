    "a primary challenge in wireless networks is to mitigate the effect of the multipath fading . exploiting techniques such as time , frequency and space diversity are the most effective methods to combat the channel fading . due to the dramatic reduction in the size of wireless devices along with the power and the cost limitations , it is not practical to install multiple antennas on mobile stations .",
    "a heuristic solution to this problem is to use a collection of distributed antennas belonging to multiple users @xcite .",
    "this new diversity scheme , referred to as cooperative diversity ( also known as _ cooperative relaying _ ) , has attracted considerable attention in ad hoc and sensor wireless networks in recent years . in particular , this approach is considered as an option in many wireless systems ; including ieee 802.16j mobile multihop relay - based ( mmr ) networks . unlike conventional relaying systems that forward the received signal in a relay chain , cooperative relaying takes one step further ; i.e. , multiple relay nodes work together to achieve a better performance .",
    "cooperative relay networks have been addressed from different perspectives ; including capacity and outage probability analysis @xcite , resource allocation ( e.g. , power allocation @xcite ) , coding @xcite , relay selection @xcite , etc .",
    "central to the study of cooperative relay systems is the problem of using _ distributed space - time coding _ ( dstc )",
    "technique as well as efficient power allocation schemes in regenerative and non - regenerative configurations @xcite .",
    "the first study on using dstc scheme in cooperative relay networks was framed in @xcite where several relay nodes transmit jointly to the same receiver in order to achieve full spatial diversity in terms of the number of cooperating nodes .",
    "reference @xcite analyzes the outage capacity in the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regime .",
    "@xcite analyze the pairwise error probability of an amplify - and - forward ( af ) single - relay system which relies on a dstc scheme . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors investigate the high snr uncoded bit - error rate ( ber ) of a two - relay system using a switching scheme for qpsk modulation .",
    "scutari and barbarossa @xcite analyze the performance of regenerative relay networks with dstc where the error on the source - relay link propagates into the second phase of the transmission in the relay - destination link .",
    "they show how to allocate the transmission power between source and relay to minimize the average ber .",
    "the ber of single and dual - hop non - regenerative relay systems with dstc has been analyzed in @xcite where different transmission policies are investigated in order to maximize the end - to - end snr .",
    "the ber of regenerative relay networks using the dstc scheme , along with different power allocation strategies over non - identical ricean channels is analyzed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduce two power allocation algorithms for af relay networks to minimize the outage probability without the dstc scheme .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a dual - hop wireless system consisting of a source , two parallel relay stations ( rs ) and a destination . assuming that each relay knows its channel with the source , the rss collaborate with each other by transmitting a space - time coded ( stc ) version of their received signals to the destination . in such configuration ,",
    "if the instantaneous received snr of the relays are unbalanced , the performance of the system degrades substantially . to overcome this problem , an adaptive distributed space - time coding ( adstc ) method",
    "is proposed , in which instead of transmitting the noisy signal at each relay with full power , the rs retransmits an appropriately scaled stc version of the received signal . the main goal is to optimize the scaling factor based on the channel - state information ( csi ) available at each relay to minimize the outage probability .",
    "the above scheme is different from the power allocation algorithms studied in @xcite ; primarily we utilize an adstc scheme based on the csi available at each relay , while in @xcite , no dstc scheme is used . in our scheme",
    ", no information is exchanged between the relay stations .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the algorithms proposed in @xcite , in which the relays need to exchange some information with each other in order to establish which relay transmits .",
    "in addition , our scheme is different from the power allocation strategies in @xcite , in which the best relays are selected based on the feedback from the destination .    in the high snr regime for the relay - destination link",
    ", it is shown that a threshold - based power allocation scheme ( i.e. , the relay remains silent if its channel gain with the source is less than a prespecified threshold ) is optimum .",
    "numerical results indicate that the derived on - off power allocation scheme provides a significant performance improvement as compared to the case that the rss forward their received signals with full power all the time .",
    "to further improve the system performance when the quality of the source - relay link is good , a hybrid amplify - and - forward / detect - and - forward scheme is proposed .    in the proposed scheme",
    ", we assume that perfect channel knowledge is available at the receiver . in practice , however , the performance of the system is degraded due to the channel estimation error . in the last part of this paper",
    ", we address this issue and evaluate the robustness of the proposed scheme in the presence of channel estimation errors .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , the system model and objectives are described .",
    "the performance of the system is analyzed in section [ analysis ] . in section [ simulation ] , the simulation results are presented .",
    "the effect of channel estimation errors on the proposed scheme is evaluated in section [ robust ] .",

    "similarly , the channel gain of the link @xmath26 is represented by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the gain associated with the path loss @xmath30 [ db ] and the channel fading coefficient , respectively . under the rayleigh fading channel model , @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "are exponentially distributed with unit mean ( and unit variance ) . also , the background noise at each receiver is assumed to be additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) . for this model , communication between s and d",

    "the algorithm starts from an initial value of @xmath46 for every @xmath48 .",
    "then , for each value of @xmath49 , @xmath47 is obtained such that the outage probability is minimized .",
    "this process continues until the algorithm converges .",
    "the results in fig . [",
    "fig : iterative ] show that the difference in performance between the proposed on - off power scheme and the centralized approach is small .",
    "therefore , the on - off scheme obtained by the asymptotic analysis in section [ analysis ] is almost optimal .",
    "[ fig : bernew ] plots the uncoded ber versus snr@xmath50 for different power schemes and bpsk constellation .",
    "we observe an error floor in the figure for the high snr@xmath50 .",
    "this can be attributed to the amplified noise received at the destination through the r @xmath18 d link . in this case , the performance is governed by snr@xmath51 , @xmath21 .    it should be noted that by using the on - off power allocation strategy at rss , we can save the energy in the silent mode .",
    "however , simulation results implies that the power saving gain in the on - off power scheme is negligible .",
    "this is due to the fact that for mid - snr@xmath51 region , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the optimum threshold level that minimizes the ber .",

    "compared to the full power scheme , the simulation results show a significant improvement in the system performance with the on - off power scheme .",
    "also , it is observed from the simulation that the trend of the fer for higher order constellations is similar to the bpsk case @xcite .",
    "up to now , we have shown that the near - optimal power allocation in each relay in the af mode is the threshold - based on - off power scheme . to further improve the system performance when the quality of s@xmath18rs@xmath17 is good ,",
    "the detect - and - forward ( df ) scheme is suggested to eliminate the amplified noise at the rs .",
    "hybrid threshold - based af / df _ scheme characterized by two threshold levels @xmath61 and @xmath62 is described as follows :    * for @xmath63 , rs@xmath17 performs the on - off power scheme developed in section [ analysis ] . * for @xmath64 , rs@xmath17 detects @xmath43 $ ] , @xmath65 , from the received signal and forwards the detected symbol @xmath66 $ ] to the destination .",

    ", we also consider the threshold - based df scheme , in which for @xmath48 less than a prescribed threshold , rs@xmath17 remains silent , otherwise it switches to the df mode .",
    "it is observed that the performance of the hybrid threshold - based af / df scheme is the same as the threshold - based af on - off power scheme and both of them are better than the pure full power and the threshold - based df schemes .",
    "throughout this paper , it is assumed that perfect channel knowledge is available at the receiver . in practice , however , the channel estimation at the receiver is often imperfect .",
    "thus , the performance of the system is degraded due to the channel estimation error . in this section ,",
    "we evaluate the fer degradation of the proposed scheme due to the imperfect channel estimation .",
    "to handle that , a pilot - based channel estimation technique is assumed , where pilot sequences are inserted at the beginning of each block .",
    "it is assumed that the pilot sequences have the same energy as data symbols . in this case , the channel estimation process is performed at the beginning of each block and the estimated value remains constant over the block .",
    "this assumption is valid under the frequency - flat rayleigh fading channel model , where the multipath channel coefficients change slowly and are considered constant . due to the imperfect channel estimation ,",
    "the channel fading coefficients can be expressed as @xmath67 for @xmath21 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 represent the channel estimation errors which are modeled as independent complex gaussian random variables with zero means and variances @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the channel estimation error has the variance equal to the inverse of the signal - to - noise ratio of the corresponding link @xcite , i.e. , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "[ fig : robustness ] shows the fer performance of the full power and the on - off power schemes versus snr@xmath50 for perfect and imperfect csi situations .",
    "we observe that for the low snr@xmath50 , the robustness of the on - off power scheme is close to the full power case .",
    "however , for high snr@xmath50 regime , the full power scheme is more robust to channel estimation errors than the on - off power scheme .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the on - off scheme , each relay @xmath74 requires csi of the link s @xmath18 rs@xmath17 for scaling factor computation .",
    "it is obvious that in this case , imperfect csi further deteriorates the performance .",
    "note that at low snr@xmath50 , the performance is governed by the second link . in this case ,",
    "csi of the link rs@xmath17 @xmath18 d becomes equally important in both schemes .",
    "in this paper , a non - regenerative dual - hop wireless system based on a distributed space - time coding strategy is considered .",
    "it is assumed that each relay forwards an appropriately scaled space - time coded version of its received signal . in the high snr@xmath75 , it has been shown that the optimum power allocation strategy in each rs@xmath17 which minimizes the outage probability is to remain silent , if @xmath48 is less than a prespecified threshold level .",
    "simulation results show that the threshold - based on - off power scheme performs close to optimum for finite snr values .",
    "numerical results demonstrate a dramatic improvement in system performance as compared to the case that the relay stations forward their received signals with full power .",
