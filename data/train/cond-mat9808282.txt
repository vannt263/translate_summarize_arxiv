    "the discovery @xcite of giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) in metallic multilayers about a decade ago has attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "this is not only because of the possibility of building sensitive magnetometers , but also because gmr provides valuable insight into spin - dependent transport in inhomogeneous systems .",
    "gmr is the drastic change in electrical resistance that occurs when a strong magnetic field is applied to a superlattice made with alternating magnetic and non - magnetic ( spacer ) metallic layers .",
    "early experiments were conducted with the so - called current - in - plane ( cip ) configuration , in which the current flows parallel to the plane of the layers . in this configuration",
    "the dimensions of the system are macroscopic with transport properties being reasonably described by a classical boltzmann equation @xcite and gmr is associated with the spin - dependent scattering of electrons at the interfaces .",
    "the first experiments with the current perpendicular to the plane of the layers ( cpp ) @xcite paved the way to a completely different regime , where quantum effects can play a dominant role . in good",
    "quality superlattices the elastic mean free path can extend over several layers and the spin diffusion length can be longer than the total superlattice thickness . in this case",
    "we can talk , according to mott @xcite , about majority and minority spin carriers as two independent spin fluids which remain coherent as they cross the superlattice layers .",
    "then a full quantum description is required . for such structures the magnetoconductance and gmr",
    "are found to be oscillatory functions of the non - magnetic layer thickness @xcite with periods extending over several atomic planes . despite the evidence of such important quantum effects ,",
    "early theoretical work was based on spin - dependent scattering at interfaces and/or magnetic impurities and completely neglected quantum interference . in 1995",
    "schep et al .",
    "@xcite challenged this conventional picture and showed that large values of gmr ( of order 120% ) exist even in absence of impurity scattering .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to develop a quantitative approach to quantum transport , which describes the dependence of gmr on specific material and/or layer thickness .",
    "our calculations are based on the landauer - bttiker formalism @xcite , using a nearest neighbor tight - binding @xmath0 hamiltonian .",
    "the tight - binding energy parameters have been fitted to accurate _ ab - initio _ density functional calculations .",
    "we have developed a novel and completely general technique for calculating green functions and hence a scattering @xmath3 matrix and transport coefficients of a finite superlattice connected to pure crystalline semi - infinite leads .",
    "this allowed us to perform a systematic study of co / a and ni / a multilayers , where a = cu , ag , pd , au and pt , and analyze optimal conditions for gmr .",
    "we shall consider below a gmr ratio of a finite superlattice connected to two semi - infinite crystalline leads @xcite , as sketched in fig .  1 .",
    "the gmr ratio is defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the conductance of a given spin channel @xmath6 in the ferromagnetic ( fm ) configuration and @xmath7 is the corresponding conductance ( for either spin ) in the anti - ferromagnetic state .",
    "we calculate the conductance by evaluating the landauer formula @xcite    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the total transmission coefficient for the spin @xmath6 calculated at the fermi energy . in what follows we assume a perfect match at the interface between the fcc lattices of the different metals .",
    "this assumption is particularly good in the case of co , cu , and ni which possess almost identical lattice constants .",
    "equation ( [ butlan ] ) is valid even in the presence of disorder .",
    "we shall consider below crystalline systems with smooth interfaces , where @xmath10 is a good quantum number ( we use the symbol @xmath11 for the in - plane coordinates and @xmath12 for the direction of the current ) .",
    "the hamiltonian can then be diagonalized in the bloch basis @xmath13 to yield    @xmath14    where the sum over @xmath13 is extended over the two - dimensional brillouin zone in the case of infinite cross section and over the allowed discrete @xmath13 s in the case of finite cross section .",
    "the problem of analyzing a realistic tight - binding model , with @xmath0 orbitals on each site represents a formidable numerical challenge @xcite . in this section",
    "we describe a very general and efficient technique for calculating the @xmath3-matrix and hence the transmission coefficients of an arbitrary scattering region such as a superlattice , attached to two semi - infinite crystalline leads .",
    "the key components of the calculation are i ) the retarded green function @xmath15 of the semi - infinite leads and ii ) an effective hamiltonian @xmath16 describing the scattering region and its coupling to the leads .",
    "the approach described below provides a versatile method for computing these two components , which are then combined via dyson s equation to yield the green function of the complete structure .",
    "a novel feature of the technique is that it avoids adding a small imaginary part to the energy and provides a semi - analytic formula for @xmath15 .      to compute the green function for a semi - infinite crystalline lead of finite cross - section",
    ", we first calculate the green function of a doubly infinite system and then derive the semi - infinite case by applying boundary conditions at the end of the lead . to this end",
    ", consider the doubly infinite system shown in fig.[greensch ] .",
    "if @xmath17 is the direction of transport , the system comprises a periodic sequence of slices , described by an intra - slice matrix @xmath18 and coupled by a nearest neighbor inter - slice hopping matrix @xmath19 .",
    "the nature of the slices need not be specified at this stage .",
    "they can describe a single band atom in an atomic chain , an atomic plane or a more complex cell .",

    "since the above analysis is valid for any choice of the hamiltonians @xmath18 and @xmath19 , this approach is very general .",

    "nevertheless we will show that large values of the gmr ratio can be obtained , in agreement with the largest experimental values , which suggests that cpp gmr is a bulk effect , whose main features are contained in a ballistic quantum description of the conductance with an accurate band structure . in what follows we model all the metals by an @xmath0 tight - binding hamiltonian with nearest neighbor couplings , whose parameters",
    "are chosen to fit the band structure evaluated from first principle calculations @xcite .",
    "the hopping parameters at the heterojunctions between different materials are assigned the geometric mean of the pure metal values .",
    "we begin our analysis by examining the dos and conductance of the pure metals .",
    "since the hamiltonians include @xmath0 hybridization , angular momentum states are not eigenstates of the system .",
    "nevertheless to understand the relative rle of the angular momentum inter - band and intra - band scattering , it is useful to project the dos and conductance onto an angular momentum basis . we will label as an @xmath148-like electron ( and similarly for the @xmath149 and @xmath1 electrons ) an electron whose @xmath148-component @xmath150 of the wave function @xmath151 is much larger than the @xmath149 and @xmath1 components .    the dos s for the two spin sub - bands of co and ni are very similar and as an example",
    "the co dos is shown in fig.[codos ] .    as in all the @xmath1 transition metals ,",
    "the dos is formed from a localized @xmath1 band embedded in parabolic @xmath148 and @xmath149 bands .",
    "the broadening of the bands is roughly the same in co and ni , as well as the position of the majority band with respect to the fermi energy . in both materials ,",
    "the fermi energy lies just above the edge of the majority @xmath1 band , while the minority band is obtained from a rigid shift of the majority band toward higher energies , the magnitude of which is larger in co than in ni . in both the minority bands of co and ni",
    "the fermi energy lies well within the @xmath1 band and the dos is completely dominated by the @xmath1 electrons .",
    "a rough estimate of the mismatch between the minority @xmath1 bands of co and ni can be obtained from the on - site energies of the @xmath1 electrons in the minority band . as shown in table [ tavazza ] , the difference between the on - site energies of the @xmath1 minority electrons in co and ni is about 0.7ev and corresponds to the relative shift of the bands ( the on - site energies shown in the table are chosen in order to have the fermi energy @xmath152 ) .",
    "the conductance of pure co and ni is determined solely by the dos . for majority electrons at the fermi energy , the current",
    "is carried by the @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath1 electrons , which give almost equal contributions . on the other hand",
    "the current carried by minority electrons is completely dominated by the @xmath1 electrons , with the contributions from @xmath148 and @xmath149 electrons being no larger than 10% .",
    "if we neglect the relative shift in energies of the minority bands , the ni and co conductances possess the same qualitative features and since the effective mass is proportional to the inverse of the band width , we find that the current carried by majority electrons is formed from a mixture of light @xmath148 and @xmath149 electrons and heavy @xmath1 electrons , whereas the minority - electron current is carried almost entirely by heavy @xmath1 electrons .",
    "now consider the non - magnetic 3@xmath1 , 4@xmath1 and 5@xmath1 transition metals with fcc lattices .",
    "a glance at the dos of these materials reveals three types of band structure : i ) the dos closely matches the dos of the majority spin sub - band of co and ni ( e.g. cu and au ) , ii ) the dos has only @xmath2 components at the fermi energy , with the d component highly suppressed ( as in ag ) , iii ) the dos is composed of an almost pure @xmath1 component at the fermi energy ( e.g. for pd and pt ) .",
    "examples of each of these are given in figure [ cuagpd ] , which shows the dos of cu , ag and pd and in figure [ curcuagpd ] , which shows the corresponding conductances .",
    "in what follows , we shall show that for ballistic structures , the mismatch between the bands of the magnetic and non - magnetic metals forming the multilayer is the key feature which determines the conductance .",
    "moreover , although the positions of the @xmath148 and @xmath149 bands are the same for both spins , for @xmath1-electrons the two spin sub - bands possess a different mismatch at the interface and therefore this mismatch ( potential step for @xmath1 electrons at the interface ) largely determines the magnitude of cpp gmr .",
    "in addition to the above generic features , the on - site energies of the @xmath148 bands of au and pt are small compared with those of ni and co. in the co / au and co / pt multilayers , this may induce strong scattering of the @xmath148-electrons , resulting in a strong suppression of the @xmath148-electron contribution to the total conductance .",
    "this effect should be weaker in the pt - based than in the au - based multilayers , because dos of platinum has mainly a @xmath1 character at the fermi energy , which means that the co / pt multilayers will feel the effect of the large @xmath148-band mismatch only through the hybridization of the @xmath148 and @xmath1 bands at the fermi energy .",
    "figure [ curcuagpd ] shows how these three distinct dos characteristics are reflected in the conductances of the normal metals and give rise to three different scenarios for charge transport : i ) the contributions to the current from @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath1 electrons are almost equal ( e.g. in cu and au ) , ii ) the current has a strong @xmath2 character ( e.g. in ag ) , iii ) the current has a strong @xmath1 character ( e.g. pd and pt ) .",
    "these different characteristics of the current carriers in the non - magnetic metals give rise to another important source of interface scattering .",
    "since the majority spins in the magnetic metals are mainly @xmath2 electrons with light effective masses and the minority spins are d electrons with heavy effective masses , it is clear that depending on the choice of non - magnetic metal , different spin - dependent inter - band scattering must occur at the interfaces .",
    "for example in the co / ag system , a majority spin propagates in co as a mixture of @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath1 electrons and in ag as an @xmath2 electron .",
    "this means that an electron in the ag , whose spin is in the same direction of the magnetization , can enter co as an @xmath2 electron without the need for strong inter - band scattering . on the other hand",
    "if its spin points in the opposite direction , it will undergo inter - band scattering , because in the minority band the electron must propagate as a @xmath1 electron .",
    "moreover the inter - band scattering involves final states with a large dos , and hence a scattering is expected to be strong .",
    "the above observations suggest that the key mechanisms affecting transport are i ) a strong band mismatch and ii ) a strong inter - band scattering .",
    "the best gmr multilayers must be able to maximize electron propagation in one of the two spin bands and to minimize it in the other . to achieve this result",
    "the high conduction spin band should have a small band mismatch and weak inter - band scattering at the heterojunctions , while the low conduction band should have a large band mismatch and strong inter - band scattering .      to clarify how the spin polarization of the magnetic material affects the properties of the gmr multilayers ,",
    "we begin by examining gmr in cu - based multilayers , in which the magnetic metals are either ni or co. all the multilayers consist of ten bilayers of the form a / cu where a is co or ni , attached to two semi - infinite cu leads . after calculating the different spin conductances in the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations",
    ", the gmr ratio is obtained from equation ( [ gmr ] ) . in all our calculations the current flows in the ( 110 ) crystalline direction and the structures are translationally invariant within the layers . in what follows we consider @xmath153 @xmath10 points ( @xmath154 ) in the plane of the layers .",
    "we have estimated that the gmr ratio calculated with @xmath155 @xmath10 points on average differs by @xmath156 , from that calculated using @xmath153 @xmath10 points ( @xmath157 ) . since the oscillations of the gmr ratio with respect to the layer thicknesses",
    "are larger than @xmath158 , the choice of @xmath153 @xmath10 points allows us to investigate the oscillating behavior of the conductance and the gmr , and is a good compromise between the accuracy of the calculation and the required computer time .",
    "initially we fix the magnetic layer thickness to 5 atomic planes ( ap ) , and calculate the conductance and gmr as a function of the cu layer thickness . in",
    "what follows , we normalize the conductance by dividing by the conductance of a single spin in the pure metallic leads ( hence in this case by one half of the total cu conductance , because of spin degeneracy ) , to yield the results shown in figure [ conigmr ] .    from figure [ conigmr ]",
    "it is clear that the co based multilayers possess larger gmr ratios . in the ferromagnetic configuration ,",
    "the majority electrons possess high conductances in both cases , reflecting the good match between the majority bands of co and ni , and the cu band . moreover",
    "the better match of the @xmath148 and @xmath149 majority bands of ni with cu , compared with those of co , gives rise to a slightly higher conductance in majority channel for ni than for co. a similar argument explains the difference in the conductances of the minority channel . as we can see from table [ tavazza ] , the minority @xmath1 band of ni is a better match to cu than that of co , as indicated by the difference in the on - site energies about 0.7 ev .",
    "hence for the minority band , the interface scattering between co / cu is greater for ni / cu . in the antiferromagnetic configuration ,",
    "both spins undergo the same scattering sequence , belonging alternately to the majority and to the minority bands .",
    "the total spin conductance in the antiferromagnetic configuration is found to be close to that of the minority band in the ferromagnetic configuration , because the minority band mismatch is larger than the majority band , and dominates the scattering .",
    "the ratio @xmath159 between the conductance ( @xmath160 ) of the af configuration and of the minority band in the f configuration ( @xmath161 is @xmath162 for co / cu and @xmath163 for ni / cu .",
    "this difference can be understood by modeling the interface scattering through an effective step potential , whose magnitude is equal to the band mismatch , as will be discussed in a future publication .",
    "the effective scattering potential in the antiferromagnetic configuration will be a sequence of high steps ( minority band ) and low steps ( majority band ) .",
    "the calculated @xmath159 ratios arise , because the perturbation of the minority steps due to the majority steps , is smaller in ni / cu than in co / cu . from this analysis",
    "the splitting between the two spin sub - bands in the magnetic materials is the crucial parameter leading to large gmr ratios and since such splitting is larger in co than in ni , co emerges as a natural candidate for high gmr ratio multilayers .",
    "note that highest possible values of gmr can probably be achieved with the use of half - metallic ferromagnets with 100% spin polarization of electrons @xcite .",
    "having examined the dependence of transport properties on the normal - metal layer thickness , we now examine the dependence on the magnetic - layer thickness . for a fixed cu layer - thickness of 5 atomic planes ,",
    "figure [ magvar ] shows results for co / cu and ni / cu multilayers .",
    "a key result of this figure is that for thin magnetic layers , gmr in both ni / cu and co / cu multilayers is suppressed due to tunneling through the effective potential barrier .",
    "thus we predict a lower limit of approximately 4 atomic planes to the magnetic - layer thickness , in order to achieve the highest possible gmr ratio . in what follows we will only consider thicknesses larger than this value .",
    "we now consider the dependence of gmr on the choice of non - magnetic material in co and ni - based multilayers . in all calculations",
    "we fix the co thickness at 5 and 10 atomic planes and vary the thickness of the non - magnetic layers from 1 to 40 atomic planes . the material in the external leads is the same non - magnetic material used for the multilayers ( e.g. ag in co / ag multilayers ) . table [ tavola3 ] shows the average value of the gmr ratio and the root mean square amplitude of oscillation around such value ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "to highlight the fact that gmr is an oscillatory function of the normal - metal thickness with an amplitude which decreases with increasing thickness , the table also shows the mean square oscillation calculated for non - magnetic metal layers thicknesses between 1 - 10 ( @xmath165 ) . in the table",
    "the subscript at co indicates the number of atomic planes of the co layers .",
    "the penultimate row of the table shows results for the ni / cu system , for which we believe that no cpp experimental results are currently available , even though the cip conductance in high magnetic field has been studied @xcite .",
    "we also speculate on the possibility of using co / ni @xcite as a gmr material , results for which are shown on the last row .    from the table iii",
    "it is clear that the gmr ratio results to depend quite sensitively on the multilayer geometry , i.e. on the layer thicknesses .",
    "in fact the simulations with the co thickness fixed at 5 atomic planes seem to suggest that the @xmath2 conductors as spacer layers ( cu , ag ) result in larger gmr ratios in this case .",
    "the simulations with 10 co atomic planes show that the multilayers with @xmath1-electron spacers ( pd , pt ) correspond to relatively larger gmr .",
    "nevertheless it is clear that the co based multilayers present much larger gmr ratios than the ni based multilayers .",
    "the table also demonstrates that the conductors dominated by @xmath1 electrons , namely pd and pt , possess very similar gmr ratios and amplitudes of oscillation and that au possesses the largest amplitude oscillations . as examples , figure",
    "[ gmrgmr ] shows plots of the gmr ratio as a function of the non - magnetic metal layer thickness for the co / ag and co / pd systems .    in all cases ( excluding au ) the oscillations",
    "are small compared with the average value of the gmr ratio , suggesting that there is an additional contribution to the long range oscillations observed experimentally .",
    "this is most likely to arise from a periodic deviation from a perfect antiferromagnetic configuration , the possibility of which is neglected in our calculations .",
    "it is important to point out that perfect antiferromagnetic alignment of the multilayer in zero magnetic field is a consequence of the exchange coupling of the adjacent magnetic layers through the non - magnetic layer . the strength and phase of such coupling depend critically on the fermi surface of the non - magnetic metal @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge no experimental data are available for the @xmath1 conductor multilayers , for which the antiferromagnetic configuration may not be achievable .",
    "nevertheless , in spin valve systems such an antiferromagnetic configuration can be always obtained by tuning the coercive fields of the different magnetic layers , for instance by an appropriate choice of the spin valve geometry , or by using some magnetization pinning technique . hence our theoretical predictions on co / pd and co / pt multilayers can , in principle , be tested in the spin valves .",
    "the above results for the gmr ratio hide the material dependence of the electrical conductance and with a view to comparing these with their band structures , we now present results for the conductances of the different spin channels and of the af configuration . in the tables",
    "[ tavola4 ] , [ tavola5 ] and [ tavola6 ] we present the conductance ( @xmath160 ) , the mean conductance oscillation ( @xmath166 ) , their ratio ( @xmath167 ) , the maximum of the conductance oscillations ( @xmath168 ) and its ratio with the mean conductance ( @xmath169 ) , respectively for the majority electrons in the ferromagnetic configuration , the minority electrons in the ferromagnetic configuration , and both spins in the antiferromagnetic configuration .",
    "all conductances are normalized to the single - spin conductance of the non - magnetic - metal leads .",
    "the tables iv - vi illustrate that , with the exception of au , materials belonging to the same class have similar normalized conductances . for cu and ag the majority",
    "( minority ) band is a high ( low ) transmission band , leading to a large gmr ratio for such materials .",
    "the majority bands of these two materials match that of co and there is little interband scattering ( even less in ag where the electrons at the fermi energy are completely @xmath2 ) .",
    "in contrast the minority bands are subject to a large scattering potential due to the difference between the on - site energies of the @xmath1-band , and also large interband scattering , due to the full @xmath1 character of the minority @xmath1 band of co. on the other hand , for pd and pt , which are @xmath1 conductors , both sub - bands undergo to high scattering albeit for different reasons .",
    "the on - site energies of the majority band of co , and of pd and pt , are roughly the same , ensuring a good band match .",
    "nevertheless the broadening of the @xmath1 majority band of co is associated with a mixing of @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath1 electrons , while the pd and pt bands are mainly @xmath1-like .",
    "hence , in the majority band of co / pd and co / pt superlattices , large inter - band scattering is present .",
    "in contrast the minority band is @xmath1-like in co , pd , and pt , but there is a significant difference in the on - site energies , resulting in a large effective potential at the interface .",
    "the au / co multilayers lie somewhat outside the above picture , because even though the @xmath1 band resembles that of ag , the on - site energies of the @xmath148 and @xmath149 bands are considerably smaller than the corresponding bands in co. this means that strong scattering occurs in the @xmath148 and @xmath149 bands and since the @xmath148 and @xmath149 electrons of au carry most of the current , there is a strong suppression of the conductance in all spin channels . from the above tables , we see that the co / au system possesses a low conductance in all the spin channels and in the antiferromagnetic configuration .    finally we note that compared with the majority spin channel the oscillations are larger in the minority spin channel and in the antiferromagnetic configuration .",
    "this suppression of oscillations in the former occurs because of the better band matching in the majority band . in figure [ conosc ]",
    "we show the conductance of the minority band as a function of the non - magnetic layers thickness , for all the materials studied .",
    "the oscillations that we observe never exceed 20% of their mean value ( except for the co / au system ) and they are larger for smaller thicknesses .",
    "this is substantially smaller then the observed values for co / ni system @xcite .",
    "the difference may in part be related to scattering on disorder , always present in experimental systems , and to simplicity of a tight - binding model that we used .",
    "in addition , actual magnetic configuration in those systems can be somewhat different as compared to an ideal one that we considered .",
    "it is interesting to note that , generally , materials with small conductances ( @xmath170 using the usual normalization for conductances ) possess larger oscillations , because low conductances indicate strong scattering potentials , and hence larger fluctuations .",
    "a qualitative picture of these conductance oscillations will be presented in a future publication , @xcite where the above quantitative results are compared with a simple kronig - penney model .",
    "firstly , we have developed a completely general green s function technique for elastic spin - dependent transport calculations , which ( i ) scales linearly with a system size and ( ii ) allows straightforward application to general tight - binding ( @xmath0 in the present work ) hamiltonians .",
    "this technique can be applied to unrestricted studies of different systems , including tunneling spin valves @xcite and magnetic multilayers with superconducting leads .",
    "the formul([gleft ] ) and ( [ gright ] ) for the surface green functions of external leads are the central result of the first part .",
    "explicit general expressions for the green s functions enable us to avoid using a small imaginary part in energy .",
    "secondly , we have presented an extensive study of transport in magnetic multilayers in cpp ( current perpendicular to planes ) geometry in the limit of large coherence length .",
    "ni and co were considered as materials for magnetic layers and several 3@xmath1 , 4@xmath1 and 5@xmath1 metals as non - magnetic spacers .",
    "key parameters have been identified as controlling a giant magnetoresistance in those systems .",
    "these are the character of electronic states at the fermi level and a mismatch in relevant band edges across interfaces .",
    "we have found that , in accordance with experiment @xcite , there are oscillations in the conductance as a function of both magnetic and spacer layer thicknesses .",
    "the magnitude of the calculated oscillations is , however , smaller than observed experimentally .",
    "some reasons for this behavior have been indicated and deserve further study .",
    "a semi - quantitative analysis of the oscillations will presented elsewhere@xcite .",
