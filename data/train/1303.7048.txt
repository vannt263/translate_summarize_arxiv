    "developing a truly adaptive data analysis method is important for our understanding of many natural phenomena .",
    "although a number of effective data analysis methods such as the fourier transform or windowed fourier transform have been developed , these methods use pre - determined basis and are mostly used to process linear and stationary data .",
    "applications of these methods to nonlinear and nonstationary data tend to give many unphysical harmonic modes .",
    "to overcome these limitations of the traditional techniques , time - frequency analysis has been developed by representing a signal with a joint function of both time and frequency @xcite .",
    "the recent advances of wavelet analysis have led to the development of several powerful wavelet - based time - frequency analysis techniques @xcite .",
    "but they still can not remove the artificial harmonics completely and do not give satisfactory results for nonlinear signals .",
    "another important approach in the time - frequency analysis is to study instantaneous frequency of a signal .",
    "some of the pioneering work in this area was due to van der pol @xcite and gabor @xcite , who introduced the so - called analytic signal ( as ) method that uses the hilbert transform to determine instantaneous frequency of a signal .",
    "however , this method works mostly for monocomponent signals in which the number of zero - crossings is equal to the number of local extrema @xcite . there were other attempts to define instantaneous frequency such as the zero - crossing method @xcite and the wigner - ville distribution method @xcite .",
    "most of these methods suffer from various limitations .",
    "for example , the zero - crossing method can not be applied to study a signal with multiple components and is sensitive to noise . on the other hand ,",
    "the methods based on the wigner - ville distribution suffer from the interference between different components .",
    "more substantial progress has been made recently with the introduction of the empirical mode decomposition ( emd ) method @xcite .",
    "the emd method decomposes a signal into a collection of intrinsic mode functions ( imfs ) sequentially through a sifting process . on the other hand , since the emd method relies on the information of local extrema of a signal , it is unstable to noise perturbation .",
    "recently , an ensemble emd method ( eemd ) was proposed to make it more stable to noise perturbation @xcite .",
    "but some fundamental issues remain unresolved .    inspired by emd / eemd and the recently developed compressive sensing theory @xcite , hou and shi proposed a data - driven time - frequency analysis method in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "the main idea of this method is to look for the sparsest decomposition of a signal over the largest possible dictionary consisting of the intrinsic mode functions ( imfs ) .",
    "the dictionary is chosen to be : @xmath6 where @xmath2 is a collection of all the functions that are smoother than @xmath7 .",
    "in general , it is most effective to construct @xmath2 as an overcomplete fourier basis in the @xmath8-space .",
    "for periodic signals , we can simply choose @xmath2 as the standard fourier basis in the @xmath8-space .",
    "then the problem can be reformulated as a nonlinear version of the @xmath5 minimization problem . @xmath9",
    "the constraint @xmath10 can be replaced by an inequality when the signal is polluted by noise .",
    "this kind of optimization problem is known to be very challenging to solve since both @xmath11 and @xmath12 are unknown .",
    "inspired by matching pursuit @xcite , hou and shi @xcite proposed a nonlinear matching pursuit method to solve this nonlinear optimization problem .",
    "the basic idea is to decompose the signal sequentially into two parts , the mean plus a modulated oscillatory part with zero mean : @xmath13 where the mean @xmath14 , the envelope @xmath15 , and the phase function @xmath8 are all unknown .",
    "we call @xmath16 an intrinsic mode function ( imf ) . after this decomposition",
    "is completed , we can treat @xmath14 as a new signal and repeat this process until the residual is small enough .",
    "the objective of this paper is to analyze the convergence of the data - driven time - frequency analysis method proposed by hou and shi in @xcite for periodic signals .",
    "we assume that the signal @xmath17 has a sparse representation over the fourier basis in the @xmath8-space for some unknown @xmath8 .",
    "the main objective of our data - driven time - frequency analysis is to design an iterative algorithm to find such @xmath8 . with a given approximate phase function @xmath18",
    ", we solve a @xmath19 minimization problem to obtain the fourier coefficients of @xmath17 in the @xmath18-space : @xmath20 where each column of matrix @xmath21 is a fourier basis in the @xmath18-space .",
    "we then use this coefficient @xmath22 to update @xmath18 , and repeat this process until it converges .",
    "when the signal has sufficiently well - resolved samples , the @xmath19 optimization problem ( [ l1-intro ] ) can be solved very efficiently by interpolation and fast fourier transform ( fft ) . in this case , the constraint @xmath23 becomes a well - posed deterministic linear system provided that the coefficient matrix @xmath21 is invertible . the linear optimization problem is then reduced to solving this linear system . since the matrix @xmath21 consists of the fourier basis in the @xmath18-space , the corresponding linear system can be solved approximately by first interpolating @xmath17 to a uniform mesh in the @xmath18-space and then applying fft .",
    "this gives rise to a very efficient algorithm with complexity of order @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the number of sample points of the signal .",
    "details of this algorithm will be given in section [ section - resolve ] .",
    "our first result is for well - resolved periodic signals of the form @xmath26 .",
    "we ignore the interpolation error and assume that @xmath27 is given for all @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "we further assume that the instantaneous frequency @xmath29 has a sparse representation in the fourier basis in the physical space given by @xmath30 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 have a sparse representation in the fourier basis in the normalized @xmath8-space given by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the normalized phase function",
    ". then we can prove that the iterative algorithm will converge to the exact solution under some mild scale separation assumption on the signal .",
    "more precisely , if the initial guess of @xmath8 satisfies @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the fourier transform in the physical space , then there exists @xmath35 such that @xmath36 provided that @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a constant determined by @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we remark that @xmath42 is a measure of the smallest scale of the signal .",
    "the scales of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath8 are measured by @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively .",
    "the requirement @xmath37 is actually a mathematical formulation of the scale separation property .",
    "the key idea of the proof is to estimate the decay rate of the coefficients over the fourier basis in the @xmath18-space , where @xmath18 is the approximate phase function in each step .",
    "we show that the fourier coefficients of the signal in the @xmath18-space have a very fast decay as long as that @xmath18 is a smooth function . using this estimate",
    ", we can show that the error of the phase function in each step is a contraction and the iteration converges to the exact solution .    in many problems ,",
    "a signal may not has an exact sparse representation .",
    "a more general setting is that the fourier coefficients of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath45 decay according to some power law as the wave number increases .",
    "we can prove that in this case , our method will converge to an approximate solution with an error determined by the truncated error of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath45 .",
    "the detailed analysis will be presented in section [ section - resolve - stable ] .    for signals with sparse samples",
    ", we can also prove similar convergence results with an extra condition on the matrix @xmath21 . in this case",
    ", we need to use the @xmath19 minimization even with periodic signals .",
    "suppose @xmath46 is the largest number such that @xmath47 .",
    "under the same sparsity assumption on the instantaneous frequency , the mean and the envelope as before , we can prove that there exist @xmath48 , such that @xmath49 provided that @xmath50 and @xmath51 . here",
    "the columns of the matrix consist of the fourier basis in the @xmath18-space , @xmath52 is the @xmath46-restricted isometry constant of matrix @xmath53 given in @xcite .",
    "further , we show that if the sample points @xmath54 are selected at random from a set of uniformly distributed points @xmath55 , the condition @xmath47 holds with an overwhelming probability provided that @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the number of the samples , @xmath59 is the number of the basis . if @xmath60 , which implies that @xmath61 , then the above result is reduced to the well - known theorem for the standard fourier basis in @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we establish the convergence and stability of our method for well - resolved signals . in section 3",
    ", we propose an algorithm for signals with sparse samples and prove its convergence and stability . in section 4 ,",
    "some numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm and confirm the theoretical results .",
    "some concluding remarks are made in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we will analyze the convergence and stability of the algorithm proposed in @xcite for well - resolved signals . by well - resolved signals ,",
    "we mean that that these signals are measured over a uniform grid and can be interpolated to any grid with very little loss of accuracy . in the analysis , we assume that the signal is periodic in the sample domain . without loss of generality , we assume that the signal @xmath17 is periodic over @xmath62 $ ]",
