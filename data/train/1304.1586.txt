    "observations of atomic and molecular gas now achieve spatial resolution of several hundred parsecs to a few kiloparsecs in large samples of nearby galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or even small sets of high redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "such observations isolate key physical conditions such as stellar surface density , metallicity , or the interstellar radiation field .",
    "however , with a few exceptions , these observations still do not resolve individual clouds of atomic and molecular gas , which are often considered to be the fundamental units of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the interpretation of these observations often utilizes predictions from models that treat the surface density of gas _ on the scale of individual clouds_. for example the models of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite all consider the structure of individual photodissociation regions or atomic - molecular complexes to explain observations on the scale of galaxies . in these models",
    ", the surface density of an individual cloud represents a key parameter , often because it indicates the degree of shielding from the ambient radiation field .",
    "because these models focus on cloud structure the mapping between the readily observed average , or `` area - weighted , '' surface density at @xmath0 kpc resolution and the cloud - scale , `` mass - weighted , '' surface density represents an essential component of comparing observations and theory .",
    "this mapping is often referred to as `` clumping '' and quantified via a `` clumping factor . ''    for the most part the adopted clumping factors represent guesses informed by our coarse knowledge of ism structure and giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) but not directly based on observations . however , this factor can also be directly measured from high spatial resolution data . in this letter",
    "we collect a large set of observations to measure the relationship between the surface density of the ism averaged over large ( @xmath0 kpc ) scales and the `` true '' small scale surface density .",
    "we consider both atomic ( ) and molecular ( , traced by co ) gas and discuss the implications of our calculation for the comparison to models .",
    "we cast this discussion in terms of three quantities : the _ mass - weighted _ average surface density , , the _ area - weighted _ average surface density , , and a clumping factor , @xmath4 , relating the two .",
    "the _ mass - weighted _ average surface density is    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the true gas mass surface density along a line of sight and the integral occurs over some area element @xmath7 .",
    "then the denominator is simply the sum of gas in that area and the calculation returns the mass - weighted average surface density over the area .",
    "that is  is the column density at which most mass exists .",
    "contrast this quantity with what is observed by a telescope for which a resolution element has size @xmath7 ,    @xmath8    that is , the telescope observes the area - weighted average surface density within the beam .",
    "these two quantities ,  and , will be the same for a smooth medium .",
    "they differ for a clumpy medium with most of the mass in small , high column density regions spread over large , low column density areas . in this case ,  may be much lower than .",
    "we define a _ clumping factor _ , @xmath4 , to quantify this distinction as :    @xmath9    @xmath4 will be high for a clumpy , inhomogeneous medium and low for a smooth medium .",
    "it will never fall below unity . in practice ,",
    "will be derived at finite resolution , so that @xmath4 could be more rigorously defined as @xmath10 , the clumping factor calculated at final resolution @xmath11 with  derived from data with intrinsic resolution @xmath12 . in this paper , @xmath11 will always be 1  kpc ; @xmath12 will vary from data set to data set .",
    "the clumping factor , @xmath4 , , and  give us a formalism to ask several questions related to the structure of the ism and the interpretation of @xmath0 kpc resolution elements :    * how does the mass - weighted @xmath13 relate to the area - weighted , observable @xmath14 for kpc - resolution measurements of atomic and molecular gas in galaxies ?",
    "what are typical clumping factors ?",
    "* is clumping the same for atomic and molecular gas , so that the h@xmath1-to-  ratio at large scales may be readily interpreted in terms of cloud structure ?",
    "* can one reliably predict the surface density of individual regions  relevant to pdr and cloud structure calculations  from coarse resolution measurements ?",
    "we assemble all readily available high spatial resolution ( @xmath15  pc ) co and  maps of nearby galaxies and use these to calculate , , and @xmath4 .",
    "we make use of three recent  surveys of nearby galaxies : things @xcite , little things @xcite , and vla angst @xcite .",
    "we supplement these with a collection of  data obtained to complement the heracles co survey ( presented in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and wsrt maps of m33 @xcite and m31 @xcite .",
    "whenever possible , we use the naturally weighted data .",
    "we include all galaxies from these surveys that have linear resolution better than 500  pc and inclination less than @xmath16 ( we except m31 and m33 from the inclination requirement ) .",
    "for the  calculation we consider only regions inside @xmath17 with column densities @xmath18  @xmath19 .",
    "we use the integrated intensity maps provided by each survey in its data release .",
    "high spatial resolution co data remains harder to come by than high resolution  data because nearby dwarf galaxies tend to be faint in co emission and the sensitivity of mm - wave telescopes has been limited before alma .",
    "this scarcity leads us to assemble a heterogeneous collection of high resolution co. this includes the magma @xcite and nanten @xcite surveys of the lmc , the iram 30-m survey of co in m31 @xcite , the combined bima and fcrao survey of m33 @xcite , alma science verification data on the antennae galaxies , and a handful of the brightest and nearest galaxies from bima song ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ngc 2903 , 3627 , 5194 , and 6946 ) .",
    "we supplement these with two new datasets : high resolution carma mapping of select fields in m31 ( pi : a. schruba , schruba et al . in prep . ) and the plateau de bure arcsecond whirlpool survey ( paws , schinnerer et al . submitted , pety et al . accepted ) of m51 . except for the alma antennae data , all of these data sets target the co @xmath20 line and include ( sometimes exclusively ) short - spacing data ; the antennae data target the co @xmath21 and co @xmath22 transitions in the antennae . in any case , these conversion factors effectively divide out when calculating @xmath4 . ] .",
    "note that we have multiple data sets on several galaxies ( m31 , the lmc , m51 ) and treat each data set , rather than galaxy , as a separate measurement . for comparison , we also calculate @xmath4 from the composite co survey of the milky way by @xcite , considering only intermediate latitude ( @xmath23 ) gas .",
    "we smooth their data with a @xmath24 kernel to minimize sampling issues and integrate only over areas covered by the surveys .    _",
    "calculating moment zero maps : _ because of the @xmath25 term in equation [ eq : iwt ] ,  is not robust to the inclusion of noise in the calculation",
    ". we must therefore mask the data before carrying out our calculations .",
    "this is mostly an issue for the co data , as the integrated intensity maps provided by the  surveys have sufficient s / n for our purposes . for the co , we create new masks and re - derive integrated intensity maps for each data set .",
    "typically we estimate the noise from the empty regions of the cube , identify a core of high significance emission , often two successive channels with @xmath26 and expand this high significance core to include fainter but still significant emission .",
    "we integrate the masked data cube to produce a moment 0 map , which we use in further analysis . for the lmc maps from magma and nanten and the m33 map ,",
    "the signal to noise at the native resolution is too low to yield a high quality masked integrated intensity map .",
    "therefore we convolve the data to a slightly worse resolution before masking and any analysis .",
    "this exercise produces maps well - suited to derive , but the process of masking at the native resolution does remove the possibility of picking up any contribution from a low s / n diffuse component ( e.g. , pety et al . ,",
    "accepted ) .",
    "fundamentally , this is a limitation of the data themselves and future , more sensitive surveys capable of detecting diffuse emission over individual lines of sight will improve this situation and quantify the contribution of faint , pervasive co emission to the total molecular gas budget times our sensitivity  an aggressive scenario  then @xmath4 drops from @xmath27 to @xmath28 over the region that we consider",
    ". fainter regions , which we avoid , will be more affected . ] .",
    "when sampling the co emission , we restrict ourselves to areas that include significant emission within the mask .",
    "roughly , our criterion is that in the map smoothed to 1  kpc resolution , the average brightness is such that we could have detected that line of sight at the original , higher resolution .",
    "that is , we consider areas where our sensitivity at high resolution is sufficient to detect the average brightness .",
    "this allows us to avoid `` edge '' or `` clipping '' effects in which only one small patch of bright emission is included in the beam , leading to high  but low .",
    "because these `` edges '' are mostly present ( within @xmath17 ) in the co and not  maps , including them would make our conclusions more extreme .",
    "_ deriving , , and @xmath4 : _ we assume that 21-cm and co emission linearly trace the surface density of atomic and molecular gas , i.e. , @xmath29 , and calculate  and  following equations [ eq : iwt ] and [ eq : awt ] .",
    "we convert from intensity to surface density adopting a fixed @xmath30  and @xmath31 = 1.823 \\times 10^{18 } i_{\\rm hi}~\\left[{\\rm k~km~s^{-1}}\\right]$ ] .",
    "note that these factors divide out when calculating @xmath4 .",
    "to calculate , we smooth from the native resolution to 1  kpc using a normalized gaussian kernel . to calculate , we calculate @xmath25 at the native resolution , convolve this map to 1  kpc resolution using a normalized gaussian kernel , and then divide that map by  following equation [ eq : iwt ] .",
    "we record , , and the clumping factor , @xmath4 , for a hexagonally - spaced set of nyquist - sampled ( at 1  kpc resolution ) points .    after this exercise",
    ", we have @xmath32 data points from 46 galaxies for  and @xmath33 data points from 15 data sets in 8 galaxies for co. as these numbers make clear , co data represent the limiting reagent in this calculation , though thanks to alma their prospect for short - term improvement is excellent .",

    "_ this conclusion leaps out of both figures . even with high linear resolution ,  column density maps remain smooth and only weakly clumped .",
    "this can be explained by most 21-cm emission originating not from clumped bound clouds , but a diffuse medium with a high volume filling factor .",

    "this is also close to the value that we estimate for the solar neighborhood from intermediate latitude gas , but we caution that we expect @xmath4 to change with improving native resolution of the data . because we consider only bright regions , this represents a conservative estimate ; the edges and faint regions that we exclude tend to have high @xmath4 .",
    "the molecule - poor systems ( m33 and the lmc ) in the sample show the highest @xmath4 , perhaps because they contain more isolated clouds and perhaps because their somewhat low metallicities lead any diffuse h@xmath1 component to emit less in co ( below some metallicity the clumping of co emission and @xmath65 will dramatically diverge ) .",

    "this is not surprising because for fixed @xmath68 , the  mass exceeds the h@xmath1 mass in these galaxies by more than an order of magnitude , with h@xmath1 making up most of the gas along only a small fraction of the lines of sight at our resolution ( m31 is more molecule - rich than the other two , but still  dominated ) .",
    "generally , we expect that across most of the area in dwarf galaxies , which tend to be low - metallicity and -dominated , @xmath4 will resemble the @xmath2 that we measure for .",
    "the outer parts of most spirals also tend to be  dominated and should show similar values , while in the molecule - rich central parts of actively star - forming galaxies the values will more closely resemble the higher @xmath4 that we find for m51 , ngc 2903 , ngc 3627 , and ngc 6946",

    "_ in contrast to the common assumption that co emerges from a population of fixed surface density clouds , the co data in figure [ fig : col_vs_col ] span two orders of magnitude in .",
    "the figure provides no good evidence that co emerges from a fixed  at high spatial resolution .",
