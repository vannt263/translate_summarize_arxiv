    "the cp violation through the ckm paradigm @xcite in the sm has been extremely successful in explaining most of the experimental data .",
    "however in the past few year a lot more data were accumulated from the two b - factories and also the improvement in the accuracy of some of the theoretical calculations led us to understand that several of the experimental results ar difficult to explain with in the sm  with three generations ( sm3 ) @xcite .",
    "this leads us the think about some beyond the sm3 scenarios and among them the simplest one is the standard model with fourth generation ( sm4 ) . in this model",
    "the sm is enlarged by a complete sequential 4th family of quarks and leptons : a new @xmath10 and @xmath11 which are the heavy chiral doublets .",
    "review and the summary statements of sm4 can be found in @xcite .    during the last years",
    ", a number of analysis were published with the goal of investigating the impact of the existence of a fourth generation on higgs physics @xcite , electroweak precision tests kribs , alwall , chanowitz , novikov , erler , polonsky , renormalisation group effects @xcite and flavor physics @xcite . in addition to this the detailed analysis of supersymmetry in the presence of a fourth generation have recently been performed in susy1 , susy2 .    in flavor physics",
    "the importance of sm4 is in the flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) which lies in the fact that on one hand it contains much fewer parameters than other new physics ( np ) scenarios like the littlest higgs model with t - parity ( lht ) , randall - sundrum ( rs ) models or the general minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and on the other hand there is the possibility of having simultaneously sizable np physics effects in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 systems compared to above mentioned np models .",
    "moreover , having the same operator structure as of the sm3 , it implies that the nonperturbative uncertainties in the sm4 are at the same level as in the sm3 .",
    "recently , buras et al .",
    "@xcite have performed a detailed analysis of non - minimal flavor violating ( mfv ) effects in the @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 system in the sm4 where they paid particular attention to the correlation between flavor observables and addressed with in this framework a number of anomalies present in the experimental data .",
    "in addition to this they have also studied the @xmath17 mixing in the sm4 where they calculated the size of allowed cp violation which is found at the observable level well beyond anything possible with ckm dynamics @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate the possibility of searching for np in the @xmath18 ( @xmath1 = @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) , where @xmath19 is a scalar meson , using the fourth generation of quarks @xmath20 . at quark level",
    "this decay is governed by @xmath21 transitions which are in forefront of indirect investigation of fourth generation . in these fcnc transitions",
    "the fourth generation quark @xmath22 , like @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 quarks , contributes at loop level .",
    "therefore , it modifies the corresponding wilson coefficients which may have effects on branching ratio and lepton polarization asymmetries of @xmath26 decay .",
    "now the main job of investigating the semi - leptonic @xmath13 meson decay is to properly evaluate the hadronic matrix elements for @xmath27 , namely the transition form factors , which are governed by the non - perturbative qcd dynamics .",
    "several methods exist in the literature to deal with this problem , such as simple quark model , light - front approach , qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) , light - cone qcd sum rules ( lcsr ) and perturbative qcd factorization approach ( pqcd )",
    ".    in our numerical analysis for @xmath28 decays , we shall use the results of the form factors calculated by lcsr approach in ref .",
    "@xcite , and explore the effects of fourth generation parameters @xmath29 on branching ratios and lepton polarization asymmetries . by incorporating the recent constraints @xmath30 gev and @xmath31 @xcite our results show that the decay rates are quite sensitive to these parameters .",
    "now the forward - backward asymmetry is zero in the sm3 for these decays because of the absence of the scalar type coupling , and it remains zero in sm4 as there is no new operator in addition to the sm3 operators .",
    "the hadronic uncertainties associated with the form factors and other input parameters have negligible effects on the lepton polarization asymmetries and this makes them the efficient way in establishing the np . here",
    ", we have also studied these asymmetries in the sm4 found that the effects of fourth generation parameters are quite significant in some regions of parameter space of sm4 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the effective hamiltonian for the semileptonic decay @xmath32section iii contains the parameterizations and numbers of the form factors for the said decay using the lcsr approach . in sec .",
    "iv we present the basic formulas of physical observables like decay rates and polarization asymmetries of final state lepton for the said decay .",
    "section v is devoted to the numerical analysis where we study the sensitivity of these physical observables on fourth generation parameter @xmath33 .",
    "the main results are summarized in sec .",
    "at quark level the decay @xmath34 is governed by the transition @xmath35 for which the effective hamiltonian can be written as @xmath36where @xmath37 @xmath38 are the four - quark operators and @xmath39 are the corresponding wilson  coefficients at the energy scale @xmath40 and the explicit expressions of these in the sm3 at nlo and nnll are given in @xcite .",
    "the operators responsible for @xmath34 are @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 and their form is given by @xmath44with @xmath45 .",
    "now , the fourth generation comes into the play just in the same way as the three generation sm , i.e. the full set of operators remains the same as in the sm3 .",
    "therefore , the effect of fourth generation displays itself by changing the values of wilson coefficients @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 via the virtual exchange of fourth generation up - type quark @xmath49 which then takes the form;@xmath50where @xmath51 and the explicit forms of the @xmath52 s can be obtained from the corresponding expressions of the wilson coefficients in sm3 by substituting @xmath53 . by adding an extra family of quarks , the ckm matrix of sm3 is extended by another row and column which now becomes @xmath54 .",
    "the unitarity of which leads to@xmath55since @xmath56 has a very small value compared to the others , therefore , we will ignore it",
    ". then @xmath57 and from eq . (",
    "[ wilson - modified ] ) we have@xmath58one can clearly see that under @xmath59 or @xmath60 the term @xmath61 vanishes which is the requirement of gim mechanism . taking the contribution of the @xmath49 quark in the loop the wilson coefficients @xmath52 s can be written in the following form@xmath62where we factored out @xmath63 term in the effective hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ effective hamiltonian 1 ] ) and the last term in these expressions corresponds to the contribution of the @xmath49 quark to the wilson coefficients .",
    "@xmath64 can be parameterized as : @xmath65 . in terms of the above hamiltonian",
    ", the free quark decay amplitude for @xmath21 @xmath66 in sm4 can be derived as : @xmath67where @xmath68 is the square of momentum transfer .",
    "the operator @xmath43 can not be induced by the insertion of four - quark operators because of the absence of the @xmath69 -boson in the effective theory .",
    "therefore , the wilson coefficient @xmath48 does not renormalize under qcd corrections and hence it is independent on the energy scale .",
    "in addition to this , the above quark level decay amplitude can receive contributions from the matrix element of four - quark operators , @xmath70 , which are usually absorbed into the effective wilson coefficient @xmath71 and can usually be called @xmath72 , that one can decompose into the following three parts @xmath73where the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 are defined as @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath77 describes the short - distance contributions from four - quark operators far away from the @xmath78 resonance regions , which can be calculated reliably in the perturbative theory .",
    "the long - distance contributions @xmath79 from four - quark operators near the @xmath78 resonance can not be calculated from first principles of qcd and are usually parameterized in the form of a phenomenological breit - wigner formula making use of the vacuum saturation approximation and quark - hadron duality .",
    "we will neglect the long - distance contributions in this work because of the absence of experimental data on @xmath80 .",
    "the manifest expressions for @xmath77 can be written as buras @xmath81with @xmath82    apart from this , the non - factorizable effects @xcite from the charm loop can bring about further corrections to the radiative @xmath83 transition , which can be absorbed into the effective wilson coefficient @xmath84 . specifically , the wilson coefficient @xmath85 is given by @xcite @xmath86 with @xmath87 , \\\\ g_{1}(x_{t } ) & = & { \\frac{x_{t}(x_{t}^{2}-5x_{t}-2)}{8(x_{t}-1)^{3}}}+{\\frac{3x_{t}^{2}\\mathrm{ln}^{2}x_{t}}{4(x_{t}-1)^{4}}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 is the absorptive part for the @xmath91 rescattering and we have dropped out the tiny contributions proportional to ckm sector @xmath92 . in addition , @xmath93 can be obtained by replacing @xmath94 with @xmath95 in the above expression .",
    "similar replacement @xmath96 has to be done for the other wilson coefficients @xmath97 and @xmath48 which have too lengthy expressions to give here and their explicit expressions are given in refs .",
    "with the free quark decay amplitude available , we can proceed to calculate the decay amplitudes for semi - leptonic decays of @xmath0 at hadronic level , which can be obtained by sandwiching the free quark amplitudes between the initial and final meson states .",
    "consequently , the following two hadronic matrix elements @xmath98need to be computed as can be observed from eq .",
