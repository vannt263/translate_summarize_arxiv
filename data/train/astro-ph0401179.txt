    "due to the observed great output rate of radiation of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , most models of the objects envision an expanding fireball ( see e.g. , goodman 1986 ; paczynski 1986 ) .",
    "the gamma - ray emission would arise after the fireball becomes optically thin , in shocks produced when the ejecta collide with an external medium or in shocks occurred within a relativistic internal wind ( rees & meszaros 1992 , 1994 ; meszaros & rees 1993 , 1994 ; katz 1994 ; paczynski & xu 1994 ; sari et al .",
    "as the expanding motion of the outer shell of the fireball would be relativistic , the doppler effect must be at work . as pointed out by krolik & pier ( 1991 ) ,",
    "relativistic bulk motion of the gamma - ray - emitting plasma can account for some phenomena of bursts .",
    "however , in many cases , the whole fireball surface should be considered , and accounting for the effect the fireball surface itself would play a role ( meszaros & rees 1998 ; qin 2002 , hereafter paper i ) .    as revealed by the observation of absorption lines of afterglows ( metzger et al .",
    "1997 ) , grbs are confirmed to be events occurring within the environment of stars .",
    "based on the assumption that there might be a strong magnitude field within the fireball and that the expansion would be relativistic , it was believed that synchrotron radiation would become a dominate mechanism ( liang et al .",
    "unfortunately , the spectra observed so far are so different that none of the mechanisms proposed can account for most of the spectral data of the objects ( band et al .",
    "1993 ; schaefer et al .",
    "1994 ; preece et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "based on the assumption of the environment of stars , mechanisms of formation of emission as well as absorption lines for grbs have been well established .",
    "meszaros and rees ( 1998 ) suggested that gamma - ray burst outflows may entrain small blobs or filaments of dense , highly ionized metal - rich material , which might be accelerated by the flow to lorentz factors in the range 10100 . in the event of neutron - star collisions or black hole - neutron star collisions ,",
    "neutrino - antineutrino annihilation can produce electron - positron pairs .",
    "thus it would be natural if there exist in the outer shell of fireballs some high energy emission lines such as the @xmath5 line and the @xmath6 annihilation line ( ramaty & meszaros 1981 ) . as reviewed by piran ( 1999 ) ,",
    "both absorption and emission features have been reported by various experiments prior to batse .",
    "absorption lines in the @xmath7 range were observed by several experiments .",
    "ginga discovered several cases of lines with harmonic structure ( murakami et al .",
    "1988 ; fenimore et al .",
    "these lines were interpreted as cyclotron lines ( reflecting a magnetic field of @xmath8 ) .",
    "emission features near @xmath9 were claimed in other bursts ( mazets et al .",
    "however , so far , batse has not found any of the spectral features ( absorption or emission lines ) reported by earlier satellites ( palmer et al .",
    "1994 ; band et al .",
    "meszaros and rees ( 1998 ) pointed out that within the relativistic fireball model an observed broadened spectral line might be a blue - shifted iron x - ray line .",
    "we suspect that , in detecting line features , the doppler effect associated with the expanding fireball might play a role .",
    "in the following we will investigate what one should expect in the spectrum if there are emission as well as absorption lines in the rest frame of fireballs .",
    "we consider a fireball expanding with a definite value of lorentz factor @xmath10 and study only the core content of the doppler effect in the fireball framework with the cosmological as well as other effects being temporarily ignored .",
    "the rest frame radiation is assumed to be constant and independent of direction .",
    "let the fireball be observed at time @xmath11 and at frequency @xmath12 .",
    "then the expected spectrum would be ( paper i ) @xmath13 with @xmath14+r_c,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the distance of the fireball to the observer ; @xmath16 is the angle to the line of sight ; @xmath17 is the rest frame emission frequency of the differential surface , of the fireball , with @xmath18 ; @xmath19 is the proper emission time of the differential surface ; @xmath20 is any coordinate time concerned ; @xmath21 is the radius of the fireball at time @xmath20 ; and @xmath22 is the rest frame intensity of the differential surface .",
    "frequencies @xmath17 and @xmath12 are related by the doppler effect .",
    "the proper time @xmath23 and observation time @xmath11 can be well linked by considering the travelling of light from the fireball to the observer ( see paper i ) .",
    "assume that during some period the radiation of the fireball is dominated by a certain mechanism and within this interval of time the rest frame radiation intensity can be expressed as : @xmath24 where @xmath25 describes the dominant radiation mechanism while @xmath26 represents the development of the intensity magnitude . for constant radiations , @xmath27 .",
    "in this case , the spectrum would be @xmath28 here the emission is assumed to cover the whole energy range .",
    "as mentioned above , there is no single mechanism proposed that can well represent all the observed spectra of grbs . in practice , an empirical form called the grb model ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) was frequently , and rather successfully , employed to fit most burst spectra ( ford et al .",
    "1995 ; preece et al .",
    "the relative intensity of the grb model is ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) @xmath29\\quad ( \\frac{\\nu _ { 0,\\theta } } { % \\nu _ { 0,p}}<\\frac{\\alpha _ { 0,g}-\\beta _ { 0,g}}{2+\\alpha _ { 0,g } } ) \\\\",

    "1 are the @xmath39 curves of the fireball containing in its rest frame radiation the two emission lines , for various values of @xmath1 .",
    "the figure shows that , in the spectrum of a relativistically expanding fireball , rest frame narrow emission lines indeed shift to higher energy bands and are significantly broadened .",
    "therefore , there would be no narrow emission lines expected in the spectrum of the object .",
    "in addition , a rest frame narrow emission line at high energy bands would form an up - turning tip of the high energy tail in the observed spectrum ( an observed @xmath40 tip can come from a rest frame @xmath41 line when @xmath42 or from a @xmath43 line when @xmath44 ) ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    to show the effect of the broadening",
    ", we calculate the relative width of the frequency range related to the @xmath45 of the line feature , @xmath46 , where @xmath2 is the observed line frequency at which the peak flux of the line feature is found .",

    "if @xmath2 is identified , then one can take it as an indicator of the expansion speed of the fireball .",
    "it also shows that , in the case discussed above , where the relative width of the rest frame narrow emission lines is @xmath51 ( see the case of @xmath52 in table 1 ) , the relative width of the line feature becomes almost one magnitude larger than that of the rest frame emission line when the fireball expands relativistically .",
    "when @xmath1 is large enough , the relative width would approach an asymptotic value ( here it is @xmath53 ) .",
    "as illustrated by an analytical calculation ( see appendix a ) , @xmath47 of a very narrow rectangle emission , which is taken to represent a very narrow emission line , can be determined by @xmath54 . when @xmath55 , it approaches @xmath56 , which is the same as that shown in table 1 .",
    "in this situation , the value of @xmath57 can be estimated by @xmath58 . when @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "the corresponding value shown in table 1 is slightly larger than this",
    ". it might be due to the width of the rest frame line feature . when calculating the line described by ( 9 ) in the case of @xmath44 by replacing @xmath61 with @xmath62 , we really obtain @xmath63 .",
