    "our primary interest is in methodology for deriving the tail asymptotics of the stationary distribution of a markov modulated two dimensional reflecting random walk for queueing network applications , provided it is stable .",
    "this process has two components , front and background processes .",
    "we assume that the front process is a skip - free reflecting random walk on a nonnegative quarter plane of lattice , and the background process has finitely many states .",
    "we are particularly interested in a two node generalized jackson network for its application .    according to @xcite",
    ", we assume the following transition structure .",
    "the state space of the front process is composed of the inside of the quarter plane and three boundary faces , the origin and the two half coordinate axes . within each region ,",
    "state - transitions are homogeneous , that is , subject to a markov modulated random walk , but different regions may have different state - transitions . between pairs of the four regions , state - transitions may also be different .",
    "see figure  [ fig : rrw1 ] in section  [ sect : two ] for their details .",
    "this markov modulated two dimensional random walk is called a discrete - time 2d - qbd process , 2d - qbd process for short , in @xcite .",
    "we adopt the same terminology .",
    "this process is flexible enough to handle many two node queueing networks in continuous time through uniformization .",
    "the generalized jackson network is such an example .",
    "for the 2d - qbd process , we assume that it has a stationary distribution , and denote a random vector subject to it by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 represents a random walk component taking values in @xmath2 while @xmath3 represents a background state . for @xmath4 , we consider the tail asymptotics by logarithmic ratios of the stationary tail probabilities in the @xmath5-th coordinate directions : @xmath6 for each fixed @xmath7 and background state @xmath8 , and those of the marginal stationary distribution in an arbitrary direction @xmath9 : @xmath10 it will be shown that those ratios converges to constants ( theorems [ thr : lower bound 1 ] and [ thr : decay rate 1 ] ) .",
    "they are negative , and their absolute values are called exponential decay rates .",
    "we demonstrate those tail asymptotic results for a two node generalized jackson network with markov modulated arrivals and phase type service time distributions .",
    "this solves the problem which has been open for many years ( see section  [ sect : jackson ] for details ) .",
    "@xcite studied the tail asymptotics in the coordinate directions including ( [ eqn : decay coordinate ] ) .",
    "he showed that the method for a two - dimensional reflecting random walk studied by @xcite is applicable with help of invariant vectors obtained by @xcite .",
    "we refer to this method as a qbd approach , which is composed of the following three key steps .",
    "* formulate the 2d - qbd process as a one dimensional qbd process with infinitely many background states , where one of the coordinate axes is taken as a level .",
    "* find right and left invariant vectors of a nonnegative matrix with qbd block structure , which will be introduced shortly , and get upper and lower bounds of the tail decay rates .",
    "* derive the tail decay rates , combining those results in the two directions .    here",
    ", an infinite dimensional square matrix is said to have qbd block structure if it is partitioned into blocks in such a way that each block is a square matrix of the same size except for the first row and first column blocks , the whole matrix is block tridiagonal and each row of blocks is repeated and shifted except for the first two rows ( see ( [ eqn : qbd structure ] ) for its definite form ) . in step 1 ) , the blocks for the one dimensional qbd are infinite dimensional , while , in step 2 ) , those for the nonnegative matrix are finite dimensional .    a hard part of this qbd approach is in step 2 ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the invariant vectors are only obtained by numerically solving certain parametrized equations over a certain region of parameters .",
    "this much degrades applicability of the tail asymptotic results .",
    "for example , it is hard to get useful information from them for the tail asymptotics in the two node generalized jackson network ( see , e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "we think this analytic intractability can not be avoided because no structural condition is assumed for the markov modulation . in applications , it may have certain structure .",
    "thus , it is interesting to find conditions for the invariant vectors to be analytically tractable while minimizing limitations in application .",
    "another problem in @xcite is complicated descriptions .",
    "they can not be avoided because of the complicated modeling structure , but we easily get lost in computations .",
    "we think here simplification or certain abstraction is needed .",
    "in addition to those two problems , the qbd approach is not so useful to study the tail asymptotics in an arbitrary direction . for this",
    ", it is known that the stationary inequalities in terms of moment generating functions are useful in the case that there is no markov modulation ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "so far , it is interesting to see whether this moment generating function approach still works under markov modulation .",
    "we attack those three problems in this paper .",
    "we first consider the description problem , and find a simpler matrix representation for a nonnegative matrix with qbd block structure .",
    "this representation is referred to as a canonical form .",
    "we then consider the problem in step 2 ) .    for this , we relax the problem by considering a right subinvariant positive vector , which is said to be superharmonic , instead of a right invariant positive vector , which is said to be harmonic .",
    "it is known that the existence of a right subinvariant vector is equivalent to that of a left subinvariant nonnegative vector ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "when a nonnegative matrix is stochastic , a right subinvariant vector can be viewed as a superharmonic function .",
    "because of this fact , we use the terminology superharmonic vector . in the stochastic case",
    ", it obviously exists .",
    "when the matrix is substochastic and does not have the boundary blocks , this problem has been considered in studying a quasi - stationary distribution for qbd processes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in step 2 ) , we do not assume any stochastic or substochastic condition for a nonnegative matrix with qbd block structure , which is crucial in our applications .",
    "as we will see , we can find necessary and sufficient conditions for such a matrix to have a superharmonic vector ( see theorem  [ thr : characterization 1 ] ) .",
    "the sufficiency is essentially due to @xcite and related to @xcite ( see remarks [ rem : super - h 2 ] and [ rem : characterization 1 ] ) .",
    "however , this characterization is not useful in application as we already discussed .",
    "so , we will assume a certain extra condition to make an answer to be tractable .",
    "under this extra assumption , we characterize the existence of a superharmonic vector using primitive data on the block matrices ( theorem  [ thr : super - h 2 ] ) .",
    "this characterization enables us to derive the tail asymptotics of the stationary distribution in the coordinate directions for the 2d - qbd process . for the problem of the tail asymptotics in an arbitrary direction",
    ", we show that the moment generating function approach can be extended for the markov modulated case . for this",
    ", we introduce a canonical form for the markov modulated two dimensional random walk , which is similar to that for a nonnegative matrix with qbd block structure .",
    "there has been a lot work on tail asymptotic problems in queueing networks ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "most of studies focus on two dimensional reflecting processes or two node queueing networks .",
    "the 2d - qbd process belongs to this class of models , but allows them to have background processes with finitely many states .",
    "there is a huge gap between finite and infinite numbers of background states , but we hope the present results will stimulate to study higher dimensional tail asymptotic problems .",
    "this paper is made up by five sections and appendices .",
    "section  [ sect : nonnegative ] drives necessary and sufficient conditions for a nonnegative matrix with qbd block structure to have a right sub - invariant vector with and without extra assumptions .",
    "this result is applied to the 2d - qbd process , and the tail decay rates of its stationary distribution are derived in section  [ sect : application ] .",
    "the tail decay rates of the marginal stationary distribution in an arbitrary direction are obtained for the generalized jackson network in section  [ sect : two node ] .",
    "we finally give some concluding remarks in section  [ sect : concluding ] .",
    "we summarize basic notation which will be used in this paper ( see tables 1 and 2 ) .",
    ".notation for sets of numbers and vectors [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     here , the sizes of those matrices must be the same among those with the same type of indices , but they may be infinite .",
    "we also will use those matrices and related notation when the off - diagonal entries of @xmath11 are nonnegative .",
    "[ sect : nonnegative ]    let @xmath12 be a nonnegative square matrix with infinite dimension . throughout this section , we assume the following regularity condition .",
    "* @xmath12 is irreducible , that is , for each entry @xmath13 of @xmath12 , there is some @xmath14 such that the @xmath15 entry of @xmath16 is positive .      in this subsection",
    ", we do not assume any assumption other than ( [ sect : nonnegative]a ) , and introduce some basic notions .",
    "a positive column vector @xmath17 satisfying @xmath18 is called a superharmonic vector of @xmath12 , where the inequality of vectors is entry - wise .",
    "the condition ( [ eqn : super - h 1 ] ) is equivalent to that there exists a positive row vector @xmath19 satisfying @xmath20 .",
    "this @xmath19 is called a sub - invariant vector . instead of ( [ eqn : super - h 1 ] ) ,",
    "if , for @xmath21 , @xmath22 then @xmath17 is called a @xmath23-superharmonic vector . we will not consider this vector , but most of our arguments are parallel to those for a superharmonic vector because @xmath17 of ( [ eqn : super - h t ] ) is superharmonic for @xmath24 .    these conditions can be given in terms of the convergence parameter @xmath25 of @xmath12 ( see table  [ tab : matrix ] for its definition ) .",
    "as shown in chapter 5 of the book of nummelin @xcite ( see also chapter 6 of @xcite ) , @xmath26 or equivalently @xmath27 .",
    "applying this fact to @xmath12 , we have the following lemma . for completeness",

    "conversely , suppose @xmath28 .",
    "then , by ( [ eqn : cp harmonic 1 ] ) , for any positive @xmath29 , we can find a positive vector @xmath30 such that @xmath31 denote the @xmath5-th entry of @xmath30 by @xmath32 , and define vector @xmath33 whose @xmath5-th entry @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 then , it follows from ( [ eqn : uk ] ) that @xmath36 , @xmath37 for all @xmath5 , and @xmath38 taking the limit infimum of both sides of the above inequality as @xmath39 , and letting @xmath40 , we have ( [ eqn : super - h 1 ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath12 indeed has a superharmonic vector @xmath17 , which must be positive by the irreducible assumption ( [ sect : nonnegative]a ) .",
    "the importance of condition ( [ eqn : super - h 1 ] ) lies in the fact that @xmath41 is substochastic , that is , @xmath12 can be essentially considered as a substochastic matrix .",
    "this enables us to use probabilistic arguments for manipulating @xmath12 in computations .",
    "we now assume further structure for @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath42 and @xmath43 be arbitrarily given positive integers .",
    "let @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 be nonnegative matrices such that @xmath44 for @xmath46 are @xmath47 matrices , @xmath48 is an @xmath49 matrix , @xmath50 is an @xmath51 matrix and @xmath52 is @xmath53 matrix .",
    "we assume that @xmath12 has the following form : @xmath54    if @xmath12 is stochastic , then it is the transition matrix of a discrete - time qbd process .",
    "thus , we refer to @xmath12 of ( [ eqn : qbd structure ] ) as a nonnegative matrix with qbd block structure .    as we discussed in section",

    "that is , @xmath17 is positive and satisfies the following inequalities . @xmath56    although the qbd block structure is natural in applications , there are two extra equations ( [ eqn : y 0 ] ) and ( [ eqn : y 1 ] ) which involve the boundary blocks @xmath45 .",
    "let us consider how to reduce them to one equation . from ( [ eqn : y 0 ] ) , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
