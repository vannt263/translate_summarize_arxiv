    "depending on the empirical calibration applied , the slope ranges from @xmath16 to @xmath29  dex  kpc , and the central abundance varies between 8.70 and 9.20  dex @xcite .",
    "the previous section makes it clear that the usage of different calibrations of ratios of bright nebular emission lines ( _ strong - line methods _ ) , which are readily accessible observationally to determine the oxygen abundance gradient from a given data set , yields systematic and non - negligible differences on both the metallicity gradient and on the central ( r=0  kpc ) oxygen abundance .",

    "the situation has remained virtually unchanged during the past decade , since the publication of stellar metallicities for 7 b - type supergiants by @xcite , and , somewhat paradoxically , lags behind the quantitative spectroscopic study of massive stars in considerably more distant galaxies ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of these stars had been originally analyzed by @xcite .",
    "additionally , two a- and one f - type supergiants were investigated by @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite revisited the metallicity derived for one of the a - type stars with more accurate non - lte calculations , and analyzed a new a - type star .",
    "it should be pointed out that the b - type metallicities obtained by @xcite were based on an lte analysis , except for one case , in which the non - lte metallicities were found to be consistent , within the relatively large ( between @xmath80.2 and 0.4 dex ) errors , even though they are 0.07  dex lower in the case of oxygen ( a similar result is obtained comparing the lte vs. non - lte analysis of the star in common with @xcite ) .",
    "these studies highlighted the difficulty of comparing the stellar and the nebular metallicities , due to the systematic differences in  region abundances obtained from different strong  line methods .",
    "for this reason , the results of the comparison were inconclusive .",
    "our new study of  regions in m31 was mostly motivated by the need to acquire _ direct _ @xmath4based nebular abundance . as this paper shows ,",
    "we have partially succeeded in our goal , but the detection of auroral lines in  region spectra remains elusive for m31 even with 10m - class telescopes .    in fig .",

    "the comparison is somewhat complicated by the large errors in the b supergiant abundances , but it is obvious that a systematic offset is present in relation to the _ direct _ abundances we determined from  regions .",
    "if we focus on the a - type supergiants ( galactocentric distance @xmath811.7  kpc ) , which have more accurate abundances , the nebular o / h ratio lies @xmath80.3  dex below the stellar value . on the other hand , among the gradients obtained from strong - line diagnostics , we find that the n2 method , as calibrated by @xcite , is in acceptable agreement with the absolute value provided by the stars ( the difference relative to the stars is reduced to @xmath80.1 dex )",
    "this situation contrasts the results obtained by our group in other , lower metallicity galaxies , for example ngc  300 , where excellent agreement is found between the metallicities obtained for stars and  regions using _ both _ the direct @xmath4based method and n2 @xcite . a situation similar to what we encounter in m31 is also found for m81 @xcite .",
    "a possible interpretation of this discrepancies will be provided in the next section .",
    "recently @xcite published the abundance analysis of 16 pne from [ ] @xmath184363 detections in the outer disk ( @xmath51  kpc ) of m31 .",
    "the radial distribution of the o / h ratio is included in fig .  [ o_abund ] ( open circles ; we recalculated the galactocentric distances from our adopted orientation parameters , table  [ m31 params ] , finding only minor differences ) .",
    "we note a striking offset between  regions and pne direct abundances ( although we note that their target 16 falls near the  region locus ) .",
    "it is not clear whether the two samples of objects are directly comparable , however , due to the fact that the pne belong to the outer disk of the galaxy .",
    "difficulties in the interpretation of the offset might also arise from the complicated chemical history of m31 ( e.g.  davidge et al .",
    "2012 for a recent summary ) .",
    "finally , we note that the slope of the pne o / h gradient obtained by @xcite , @xmath52 dexkpc@xmath53 , is somewhat flatter than the one we derive from  regions .",
    "we add that a flatter gradient for pne compared to  regions has also been recently determined in the galaxy ngc  300 ( stasinska et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) , and corroborates recent model predictions of galactic chemical evolution @xcite .",
    "one of the main conclusions obtained in this paper is that the slope of the oxygen abundance gradient in m31 from the analysis of the  regions is quite robust , approximately @xmath54",
    "dexkpc@xmath53 , regardless of the choice of abundance diagnostic used ( with the notable exception of the @xcite and @xcite calibrations ) . however , the @xmath80.3 dex offset between the _ direct _ abundances ( obtained from the auroral line detections ) and the stellar abundances is somewhat disturbing , especially considering the fact that the direct abundances also lie significantly below those obtained from strong - line methods that , by construction , should be in agreement with the direct determinations .",
    "since the discrepancy could be a result of the higher metallicity of m31 compared to other galaxies where such offset is not observed , we suggest an interpretation based on biases affecting the direct abundances .",
    "as is well known , with increasing o / h the detection of the auroral lines in the spectra of  regions becomes increasingly difficult .",
    "this is due to the exponential dependence of the line emissivities on the electron temperature , and the decreasing nebular temperatures with increasing metallicity due to more efficient cooling . as a result ,",
    "very few auroral line detections exist in the literature for extragalactic  regions with metallicity above solar .",
    "therefore , given the metallicity ( around the solar value ) found for the supergiant stars in m31 it is not surprising that we only have a few [ ] @xmath184363 detections . under these conditions",
    "we would preferentially detect this line just for some of the hottest ( less metal enriched )  regions , which leads to a bias in the derived average oxygen abundance : the abundance estimated from the few [ ] @xmath184363 detections would underestimate the mean o / h ratio .",
    "this would explain why the auroral line - based abundances lie below the strong line abundances obtained from methods such as n2 and n2o2 , which have been calibrated using  regions with detections of auroral lines .",
    "if we assume an observational abundance scatter of @xmath55  dex ( comparable to what has been measured in other nearby galaxies , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , we can expect to systematically underestimate the oxygen abundance by as much as @xmath80.15  dex if we assume that our auroral line detections refer to the hottest nebulae only , i.e.  are not representative of the mean  region population .",
    "most of the remaining discrepancy with the stellar abundances could be explained by depletion of oxygen onto dust grains , which has been estimated to be @xmath80.12  dex at high metallicity ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if we account for these effects , the central abundance of m31 would be approximately 12+log(o / h ) = 8.94@xmath150.10  dex ; i.e.  between 1.4 and 2.2 times the solar value .",
    "finally , we also point out that a discrepancy between _ direct _ nebular abundances and stellar abundances increasing with metallicity would naturally result from the presence of inhomogeneities in the temperature distribution within an  region @xcite or by the effect recently reported by @xcite , who proposed that the energy distribution of electrons in  regions deviates from a maxwell - boltzmann one .",
    "further tests of the mechanisms proposed here to explain the systematic offset between @xmath4-based  region abundances and stellar metallicities would require to increase the sample of  regions with _",
    "direct _ abundance determinations for metal - rich ( super - solar ) galaxies , together with a program aimed at measuring metallicities of blue supergiant stars . in the specific case of m31 ,",
    "in particular , more accurate stellar abundance data for a large sample of b - type stars would be highly desirable .",
