    "current progress in millimeter and submillimeter observations have found peculiar signature in ratios of molecular lines towards numbers of compact gas at the centers of active galaxies .",
    "the pioneering works of kohno _ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) showed that some of nearby seyfert galaxies have enhanced ratio of @xmath0 as high as 2.5 or more .",
    "following observations of various molecular lines have given rise of discussion of peculiar chemistry such as photon dominated region ( pdr ) or x - ray dominated region ( xdr ) ( meijerink _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , aalto _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . )",
    "however , since the compact molecular core is not resolvable with current mm / submm observational instruments , one has to take into account of internal structures within a core .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations present highly inhomogeneous density and temperature structure within a compact molecular gas at the center of a galaxy ( wada & tomisaka @xcite ) . in an inhomogeneous molecular gas naturally expected",
    "is the inhomogeneous population distribution .",
    "we performed three - dimensional non - thermodynamic equilibrium ( nonlte ) molecular line transfer simulations , and examined the effects of excitation status inside a clumpy torus .",
    "we first performed hydrodynamic simulations of molecular gas in a steady gravitational potential of supermassive black hole of @xmath2 and galactic halo ( see for details , wada & tomisaka @xcite , yamada _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulation explicitly includes radiative cooling , feedback from supernovae , strong uv heating ( @xmath3 ) for thermal evolution as well .",
    "resultant molecular ism has a highly inhomogeneous structure in density , temperature , and turbulent velocity .",
    "next we calculated three - dimensional nonlte line transfer of hcn and hco@xmath1 pure rotational lines using a snapshot data of hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "we assumed spatially uniform molecular abundance distribution in order to examine the effect of clumpy excitation conditions on the line ratio @xmath4 separately from chemistry models .",
    "( left panel ) .",
    "right panel shows integrated intensity averaged over the field - of - view as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "line with squares denotes hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) line , and line with crosses denots hcn(1 - 0 ) line , respectively.,width=377 ]    in figure [ fig : result1 ] ( a ) we present integrated intensity distribution of hcn(1 - 0 ) ( @xmath6 ) line .",
    "the distribution of @xmath6 shows clumpy structure , reflecting the highly inhomogeneous internal structure of the model torus .",
    "the typical size of the bright spots in fig . [ fig : result1 ] is @xmath7 if the torus is located at the distance of @xmath8 20 mpc .",
    "thus though current mm - telescopes smear out these internal structures , high angular resolution of forthcoming telescope such as atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) will reveal inhomogeneous structures in molecular tori in distant galaxies .",
    "the fig.[fig : result1 ] ( b ) plots integrated intensities of hcn(1 - 0 ) and hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) avraged over the `` field of view '' of our simulations as a function of fractional molecular abundance @xmath5 .",
    "for the same value of @xmath5 , @xmath9 is always larger than @xmath10 , which means that a ratio of @xmath11 observed in some of nearby galaxies requires onverabundant hcn compared with hco@xmath1 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this result and recent chemical studies of pdr and xdr do not seem to support the original idea of mm / submm molecualr line diagnostics of agn / starbust connection ( e.g. kohno et al .",
    "@xcite ) . other models , such as mid - infrared ( mir ) photon pumping ( e.g. , graci - carpio @xcite ; aalto @xcite ) or hot core chemistry ( e.g. , stuber @xcite ) have been proposed , though , theoretical model description of molecular line ratios been controversial .",
    "current progress in submm observations enables multi - transion analysis and probe of warm and dense gas at the centers of external galaxies . in figure",
    "[ fig : result2 ] ratio of integrated intensities @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( hereafter denoted as @xmath15 ) is plotted as a function of fractional molecular abundance @xmath5 . in our simulation results ratio",
    "@xmath15 clearly decreases with @xmath5 .     as a function of viewing angle with respect to rotational axis of the torus .",
    "right panel shows population ratio of @xmath16 and 1 , or excitation temperature of @xmath17.,width=340 ]    on the other hand , one - zone analysis predicts a reverse trend : if @xmath5 is small , optical thickness @xmath18 is expected to be small , then the ratio @xmath15 will be @xmath19 where @xmath20 is collisional excitation constant from energy level @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath5 is large , @xmath18 will be also large , and @xmath15 approaches unity .",
    "this result indicates the importance of the inhomogeneity in structure of the torus .",
    "we model the clumpy torus as two - phase ism consists of 1 ) dense clumps with @xmath23 and 2 ) tenuous ambient medium with @xmath24 .",
    "if we assume high kinetic temperature ( @xmath25 ) and optically thin over a whole region , intensity ratios become ( see eqs . [",
    "9 ] and [ 10 ] of yamada et al .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath26 mean ratio @xmath27 in a synthetic observation beam can be written as a kind of average of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes a volume filling factor of dense clumps .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ave ] ) means that if @xmath31 is sufficiently smaller than unity , @xmath15 can take a value of order unity _ even if the medium is optically thin . _ in our radiative transfer simulations , `` dense clumps '' can safely be defined as regions with @xmath32 @xmath33 ( close to @xmath34 of hcn(1 - 0 ) transition ) , and @xmath35 is indeed @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , nonlte population ( occasional @xmath37 for @xmath381 - 0 transitions ) and inhomogeneous optical thickness distribution complicate the @xmath15 distributions ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : result2 ] ) .",
    "our analysis demonstrates the importance of inhomogeneity of molecular gas in estimation of physical properties from line ratios from unresolved observational data .",
    "inherent inhomogeneity should be paid much attention when interpreting line ratio in terms of chemical evolution of molecular gas .",
    "we examine molecular line diagnostics of molecular gas in the center of external galaxies using three dimensional radiative transfer simulations .",
    "our results demonstrate that realistic inhomogeneous molecular gas can produce line ratio values unexpected from one - zone analysis , and emphasize the ability and applicability of our approach , that is , compilation of high - resolution hydrodynamic simulations and three - dimensional radiative transfer calculations ( `` telescope of theory '' ) towards forthcoming alma era .",
