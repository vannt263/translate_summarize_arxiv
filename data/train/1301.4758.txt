    "nls1s make up @xmath8% of an optically selected active galactic nucleus  ( agn ) sample from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xmath9-ray emissions have been detected from several very radio - loud nls1s by the large area telescope onboard the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope @xcite ; it has been argued that these nls1s may represent a third class of @xmath9-ray emitting agns along with blazars and radio galaxies .",
    "the detected @xmath9-rays strongly suggest the presence of blazar - like phenomena as a consequence of relativistic beaming effects due to a fast jet aligned close to our line of sight @xcite .",
    "moreover , the presence of highly relativistic jets in radio - loud nls1s has been implied on the basis of radio flux variability observations @xcite , very - long baseline interferometry  ( vlbi ) imaging @xcite , and modeling of the spectral energy distributions @xcite .",
    "kiloparsec ( kpc)-scale radio morphology is associated with several radio - loud nls1s , including two @xmath9-ray emitting nls1s @xcite .",
    "however , these powerful jet phenomena are observed in only a small part of the nls1 populations .",
    "in fact , the fraction of radio - loud objects is defined as the ratio of the 5  ghz radio flux density and optical _ b_-band flux density .",
    "a threshold of @xmath10 separating radio - loud and radio - quiet objects @xcite is frequently used . ] in the nls1 population is significantly low @xcite , @xmath11% with @xmath12 and @xmath13% with @xmath14 @xcite , compared with normal seyfert galaxies and quasars ( @xmath15%15% ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". similarly , kpc - scale radio emissions are less common in nls1s than in broad - line agns @xcite .",
    "the radio jet characteristics of a huge amount of the radio - quiet nls1 population behind these extremes are little known .",
    "nls1s as a class are considered to have weak jet activities .",
    "a radio - imaging study at arcsecond resolution using the very large array ( vla ) revealed that nearby ( radio - quiet ) nls1s , in most cases , are unresolved radio sources [ @xmath16  parsec  ( pc ) ] with modest radio luminosities ( @xmath17@xmath18  w  hz@xmath7 ) and steep radio spectra ( @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the flux density at the frequency @xmath22 ) .",
    "thus , nls1s are not remarkably different from normal seyfert galaxies at radio wavelengths ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) , although they exhibit many distinctive optical  x - ray properties .",
    "in addition to the unusually narrow balmer lines , nls1s exhibit several extreme properties such as strong permitted emission lines @xcite , rapid x - ray variability @xcite , steep soft x - ray spectra @xcite , and frequently observed blue - shifted line profiles @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that these properties are related to high - mass accretion rates close to the eddington limit @xcite on relatively low - mass black holes ( @xmath2310@xmath24  m@xmath25 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a high - accretion rate on a low - mass black hole supports the radio - quiescence of the nls1 class , according to many studies using large agn samples : a positive correlation between radio loudness and the black hole mass @xcite and an anti - correlation between radio loudness and the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite discovered `` a fundamental plane of black hole activity '' in three - dimensional space consisting of the radio luminosity , x - ray luminosity , and black hole mass ( ranging from @xmath26 to @xmath27  m@xmath28 ) for samples of x - ray binaries , our galactic center , low - luminosity agns , seyfert galaxies , and quasars .",
    "these tendencies in jet activity can be attributed to nonlinear dependences on the black hole mass and accretion rate .",
    "thus , the weak radio emissions of nls1s as a class can be understood in the framework established for other agn classes .",
    "however , the picture of a nonthermal jet origin for the observed radio emissions of nls1s has not been fully established yet , particularly for the radio - quiet subclass , because of the difficulty of vlbi observations of weak radio sources .",
    "previously , a nonthermal jet origin for radio - quiet quasars was established by a series of vlbi detections .",
    "the first vlbi study focusing on the nls1 class at milli - arcsecond  ( mas ) resolutions examined the very _ radio - loud _ narrow - line quasar pmn  j0948 + 0022 using the very long baseline array ( vlba ) @xcite . a doppler - beaming effect of highly relativistic jets is required to explain the observed extremely high brightness and rapid flux variability in the vlba images .",
    "subsequent @xmath9-ray detection by _",
    "fermi_/lat followed @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected five additional radio - loud nls1s using the japanese vlbi network and established the picture of a nonthermal process in the radio - loud nls1 subclass .",
    "@xcite reported compact radio structures for three of the five radio - loud nls1s using vlba imaging .",
    "@xcite found evidence of pc - scale jet structures in all the five radio - loud nls1s and pointed out ( 1 )  the presence of relativistic nonthermal jets , which are essentially the same as those of other radio - loud agn classes and ( 2 )  the existence of both apparently radio - loud nls1s owing to doppler beaming and intrinsically radio - loud nls1s .",
    "several @xmath9-ray emitting nls1s have been observed in survey programs of vlbi radio sources : sbs  0846 + 513 @xcite , 1h  0323 + 342 @xcite , and pks  1502 + 036 ( @xcite , see also @xcite for a study of this object as a compact radio galaxy candidate ) and are now being monitored by vlba in the mojave program . on the other hand ,",
    "there have been only a handful of images of radio - quiet nls1s : mrk  766 , akn  564 @xcite , ngc  5506 @xcite , ngc  4051 @xcite , and mrk  1239 @xcite as part of a study of seyfert galaxies ( not focused on nls1s ) .",
    "a systematic vlbi study of radio - quiet nls1s is crucial for understanding the nature of their radio - quiescent central engines with the lowest - mass black holes at the highest accretion rates in agn classes .",
    "furthermore , radio - loud nls1s should be discussed as extreme examples on the basis of more solid knowledge of radio - quiet objects that are the majority in the nls1 population .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report vlbi imaging of seven nearby radio - quiet nls1s . in section  [ section :",
    "sample ] , we describe the sample selection . in section  [ section : observation ] , we describe the observations and imaging processes .",
    "the observational results are presented in section  [ section : result ] .",
    "we discuss the observed radio properties of the radio - quiet nls1s in section  [ section : discussion1 ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our studies in section  [ section : summary ] .",
    "the observed properties of individual radio - quiet nls1s are described in appendix  [ section : individualobject ] . throughout this paper , a @xmath29cdm cosmology with @xmath30  km  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath7 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is adopted @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the vlba - detected flux density was significantly lower than the vla total flux density for all the sources , indicating low fractions of high - brightness components ( @xmath33  k ) relative to lower - brightness components ( section  [ section : tb ] ) . in this paper , the radio core fraction , @xmath34 , is defined as the ratio of the flux density from the central 10  pc ( in diameter ) to the total flux density at 1.7  ghz in the rest frame . at the distances to our samples , 10",
    "pc typically corresponds to @xmath8  mas [ column  ( 10 ) in table  [ table3 ] ] .",
    "our vlba baselines can retrieve @xmath35% of the emissions as a correlated flux density at the minimum ( projected ) length of @xmath36  km for the 20-mas radio size .",
    "hence , the fluxes from the central 10  pc were practically measurable [ column  ( 11 ) in table  [ table3 ] ] . on the other hand",
    ", we can not rule out the possibility that emissions with much larger angular scales were partially or scarcely detected ( `` resolved out '' ) .",
    "hence , we adopted the total flux densities from the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; * ? ? ? * ) at 1.4  ghz as listed in table  [ table1 ] ; the contribution of extended component was calculated by subtracting the @xmath37  pc contribution at 1.4  ghz from the nvss value at the rest frame , and then , converted to the value at 1.7  ghz , assuming spectral indices of compact and extended components ( see , appendix  [ section : individualobject ] and table  [ table3 ] in detail ) .",
    "consequently , the core fractions were typically less than 10% , up to 24% at most [ column  ( 12 ) in table  [ table3 ] ] .",
    "because the entire radio structures are @xmath3  pc in the vla images [ column  ( 12 ) in table  [ table1 ] ] , a significant portion of the emissions should originate in the regions of @xmath15300  pc in the form of low - brightness components detected ( @xmath1  k ) and not detected ( @xmath38  k ) in the vlba images .",
    "in fact , we recognized a clear enhancement in the visibility amplitude of mrk  1239 at baselines of @xmath39  m@xmath0 [ figure  [ figurea ] ( a ) in appendix  [ section : individualobject ] ] and marginal enhancements also in mrk  766 and akn  564 ( appendix  [ section : individualobject ] ) .",
    "these are evidences for the presence of a significant amount of emission components with sizes of @xmath40  mas , corresponding to @xmath4130  pc for these sources .",
    "our vlba imaging provides the first insight into the pc - scale region of several nearby radio - quiet nls1s in a radio band .",
    "all five detected radio - quiet nls1s have a compact radio component with a high - brightness temperatures of @xmath42  k. this is an evidence of _ a nonthermal process driven by jet - producing central engines in radio - quiet nls1s _ , as well as radio - quiet seyfert nuclei and radio - quiet quasars .",
    "it is notable that the central components make only minor contributions compared to the vla total flux densities ( i.e. , low values of @xmath34 ; section  [ section : sourcestructure ] ) .",
    "a previous study using the vlba reported that all but 1 of 39  radio - selected low - luminosity agns were detected , and they exhibited core - dominated structures in most cases ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , the radio - quiet nls1s in our sample present a contrasting aspect , although both of the agn subclasses are weak radio sources in the nearby universe .",
    "the radio spectra are also quite different : flat or mildly inverted spectra in low - luminosity agns @xcite but steep spectra in nls1s @xcite .",
    "such flat or inverted spectra would be accounted for by optically thick synchrotron emitters at the base of the jets .",
    "the scale - invariant jet model predicts that the radio luminosity from the jet bases depends on @xmath43 in most accretion scenarios , where @xmath44 is the black hole mass .",
    "in fact , the known radio sources of low - luminosity agns tend to have large black holes of @xmath45@xmath46  m@xmath25 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) in contrast to values of @xmath47@xmath48  m@xmath25 for the radio - quiet nls1s in our sample ( table  [ table1 ] ) and the majority of nearby nls1s ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , compared with low - luminosity agns , the radio - quiet nls1s possess less efficient radio cores .",
    "moreover , the radio - quiet nls1s also exhibit significantly lower core contributions than radio - loud nls1s @xcite ; core enhancement due to the doppler beaming effect is a natural explanation in some cases @xcite . in our vlba images with limited dynamic ranges , we found no clear evidence of highly relativistic jets , such as unusually high - brightness temperatures requiring doppler boosting @xcite , for the radio - quiet nls1s .",
    "we will present a comprehensive study of the core activity of both radio - quiet and radio - loud nls1s in another paper ( doi et  al .  in preparation ) .",
    "past vla surveys of nls1s found a combination of two radio properties : compact sources ( @xmath3  pc ) and very steep spectra @xcite .",
    "this had indicated that the radio sources should be localized , but physically not so compact that they become optically thin in synchrotron radiation .",
    "our vlba observations have confirmed this picture at the pc scale .    as an example , mrk  1239 is only slightly resolved in vla images at arcsecond resolutions and is revealed to exhibit very diffuse structures within 40  pc in the vlba image .",
    "less than half of the total fluxes were detected in the vlba image and originate in low - brightness components of @xmath49  k ( appendix  [ section : individualobject ] ) .",
    "we examine the possibility of the thermal process ( free  free emission ) for radio - emitting plasma of 15.2  mjy ( the vlba flux density of the extended component for mrk  1239 ) .",
    "the brightness temperature of @xmath50  k gives a physical temperature of @xmath51  k. according to the gaunt factors of @xmath15 and @xmath52 at @xmath53  ghz  @xcite and @xmath53  kev  @xcite for plasma at @xmath54  k , the expected x - ray luminosity would be @xmath55  erg  s@xmath7 at 0.12.4  kev @xcite , much higher than @xmath56  erg  s@xmath7 observed by _ rosat _ toward mrk  1239 ( @xcite , see a similar discussion for radio - quiet quasars by @xcite ) .",
    "it is difficult to reconcile a thermal process with the observed low - brightness radio emissions .",
    "the remaining lower brightness components ( @xmath57  k ) that were below the vlba sensitivity are presumably nonthermal jets as well because the position angle of the vla - resolved structure of mrk  1239 [ figure  [ figurea ] ( b ) in appendix  [ section : individualobject ] ] is consistent with the direction of the two - sided jet - like structure in the vlba image . a steep spectrum in total flux [ figure  [ figurea ] ( c ) appendix  [ section : individualobject ] ] also strongly supports a nonthermal synchrotron origin for the diffuse emissions .",
    "mrk  705 and mrk  766 also exhibit clear morphological evidences of jets in the vlba images .",
    "a large portion of the total flux density comes from diffuse components ( @xmath58 and 0.07 , respectively ) , which is also the case for mrk  1239 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the other nls1s also showed low core fractions ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "ngc  4051 was not detected in our observation with @xmath61 but was detected by @xcite at 1.6  ghz by very sensitive vlbi imaging .",
    "the radio morphology is symmetric and shows two - sided lobe - like emissions separated by 20  pc and centered at a core of sub - mjy , which is aligned with larger - scale emissions in the vla images ( appendix  [ section : individualobject ] ) .",
    "there is an additional radio - quiet nls1 that was previously observed by vlbi .",
    "the radio core of ngc  5506 , a hidden nls1 candidate @xcite , is surrounded by several diffuse components in the pc - scale region ; a bridging morphology indicates a physical connection between the core and the diffuse components via jets @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a low - surface - brightness halo @xmath62  pc in diameter enshrouds the central features in a vla image @xcite , and only one - third of the single - dish flux was detected by vlbi @xcite .",
    "thus , _ a large portion of the radio luminosities come from diffuse emission components distributed within the nuclear regions ( @xmath3  pc ) , which is a general property of non - thermal jets in radio - quiet nls1s_.    these diffuse components are putative reservoirs of dissipated jet kinetic powers . for our samples ( @xmath63@xmath48  m@xmath25 : table  [ table1 ] ) and the majority of nearby nls1 populations ( @xmath64  m@xmath25",

    "( mrk  705 ) possesses an extended radio power of @xmath67  w  hz@xmath7 at 1.4  ghz , suggesting an estimated jet kinetic power of @xmath68  erg  s@xmath7 ( by using the relation of * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "@xcite reported a vlbi detection of mrk  766 at a relatively high intensity 7.1  mjy  beam@xmath7 with a synthesized beam of @xmath842  mas at 5  ghz , which was inconsistent with a merlin archival image at 5  ghz ( merlin proposal code : 92nova ) that showed diffuse emission of only 1.8  mjy  beam@xmath7 ; this discrepancy might be because of variability .",
    "because of the negative detection before self - calibration  ( section  [ section : vlbaobservation ] ) , the astrometric position could not be obtained from our vlba observation .",
    "our vlba image at 1.7  ghz ( figure  [ figure1 ] ) showed a single component of 1.3  mjy , which retrieved 4% of the total flux density at the rest frame on the basis of the 1.4-ghz nvss flux density and assumed spectral indices of @xmath105 and @xmath106 for the vlba and diffuse components , respectively .",
    "the vla a - array image at 4.9  ghz showed an unresolved ( @xmath107  pc ) source of 3.5  mjy @xcite .",
    "akn  564 is one of two nls1s not detected in our vlba observation .",
    "the vla a - array image at 8.46  ghz showed a triple structure ( 3.1 , 3.0 , and 0.9  mjy ) extending 320  pc to the north @xcite .",
    "a merlin archival image showed somewhat diffuse emissions of only 1.04  mjy  beam@xmath7 at 5  ghz with a 40  mas beam , which seemed to be consistent with our negative detection .",
    "on the other hand , a mas - scale structure with 3.7  mjy  beam@xmath7 had been detected at 5  ghz by conventional fringe fitting  ( i.e. , not phase referencing ) using a much more sensitive vlbi array of @xmath842  mas resolution at 5  ghz by @xcite",
    ". however they mentioned that they were not confident about the structure .",
    "the phase - tracking center of our vlba observation was determined from the vla archival data ab973 obtained with the a - array at 8.4  ghz ( table  [ table1 ] ) using the icrf position of the phase calibrator j2236 + 2828 and differed by only @xmath84260  mas from that of @xcite .",
    "hence , it was unlikely that the nucleus of akn  564 was outside of the vlba s fov . some amount of diffuse emissions could be in the vlba fov because the correlated amplitude was enhanced at baselines of @xmath108  m@xmath0 , and the image noise was significantly higher than the expected thermal noise level  ( section  [ section : datareduction ] ) .",
    "hence , we concluded that akn  564 is dominated by diffuse components at pc scales , which are responsible for our negative detection .",
    "the spectral index between 1.4 and 4.9  ghz is @xmath109 @xcite .",
