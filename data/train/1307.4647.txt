    "transmission properties and their control in inhomogeneous media with complex geometric structure has developed into a field of intense study with applications to electronic @xcite , photonic @xcite , acoustic @xcite and magnonic @xcite systems .",
    "aperiodic systems possess a central role both in understanding the fundamental concepts which govern the transitions from perfectly periodic order to randomness , and in the development and design of devices with controllable transport properties .",
    "photonic multilayered devices constitute a wide class of such systems , offering the unique possibility to relate geometrical with optical properties in a direct and efficient manner .",
    "typical examples are photonic multilayers possessing a quasiperiodic fibonacci @xcite , fractal cantor @xcite or even more general aperiodic geometry @xcite , leading to scaling and self - similarity of the corresponding optical transmission spectra",
    ". of particular interest is the case of perfect ( that is , reflectionless ) light transmission through an aperiodic multilayer .",
    "there are many cases supporting that the presence of mirror symmetry in a multilayer device leads to perfectly transmitting resonances ( ptrs ) , while the lack of such symmetry is usually accompanied by non - vanishing reflection .",
    "an instructive example of this scenario is the occurrence of ptrs in multilayers with fibonacci order after appropriate symmetrization of the device @xcite .",
    "these results suggest a direct link between global mirror symmetry and ptrs .",
    "recent results , however , report on the presence of ptrs in devices without global mirror symmetry @xcite , indicating that it is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the appearance of perfect transmission . in some cases",
    ", the occurrence of ptrs in such devices has been attributed to ` internal ' @xcite or ` hidden ' @xcite symmetries . in ref .",
    "@xcite , conditions for the occurrence of ptrs are derived for hybrid periodic - aperiodic photonic devices , and in ref .",
    "@xcite ptrs arise in a band gap approach , though without explicit reference to the symmetry of the setups .",
    "these works provide significant insight into the resonant scattering processes in ( effectively ) 1d inhomogeneous media .",
    "however , the link between transmission properties and the spatial symmetries of the underlying scattering structure has not yet been fully understood .",
    "a key observation is that , although being globally asymmetric , a system can retain mirror ( or , equivalently in one dimension , parity ) symmetry within a part of it , thus being _ locally symmetric _ @xcite .",
    "indeed , the basic common feature of the above - mentioned asymmetric aperiodic setups is that they can be decomposed into mirror symmetric , non - overlapping smaller parts , which cover the entire device ; we refer to such systems as _ completely locally symmetric_. depending on the setup , there can exist a multitude of local symmetry decompositions at different scales and with different symmetry axes .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) depicts a photonic multilayer setup , whose _ maximal _ local symmetries ( i.e. , of largest range around a given axis ) are indicated by arcs in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ; traversing the setup from left to right along different combinations of arcs , including the non - maximal ones ( not shown ) , yields several different local symmetry decompositions .",

    "[ aperiodic ] . ]    in the present work we provide a natural classification of ptrs occurring in locally symmetric photonic media , based on the collective contribution of domain - wise invariant , field - dependent quantities characterizing the domains of local symmetry .",
    "this is done by extending the formalism of local parity ( lp ) symmetry developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for 1d quantum scattering , applied here to scattering of classical electromagnetic waves .",
    "the analysis allows for a geometrical representation of three different types of resonances , which is valid for generic 1d variations of the refractive index , and subject only to the restriction to complete local symmetry .",
    "we focus here on piece - wise constant refractive index , which models the intesively studied photonic multilayers , and give an alternative explanation to the origin of ptrs reported for such systems , in terms of local symmetries .",

    "before performing the analysis and classification of ptrs in aperiodic photonic multilayers , we will here adapt and further develop the concepts introduced in ref .",

    "the electric component of a monochromatic plane light wave of frequency @xmath11 obeys the equation @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the spatially dependent refractive index .",

    "( [ eq : helm ] ) , is 1d and isomorphic to the quantum counterpart , we can apply the lp formalism introduced in ref .",

    "the wave thus propagates only in forward direction within the gaps , as is evident from the corresponding plateaus of the field ( @xmath167 along the gaps in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b)(@xmath112 ) ) .",
    "note that , if we set @xmath168 , the second ptr at @xmath133 would be the equivalent to the single ptr of the unmodified setup in ref .",
    "we see here that , by inserting a third type of slab in the multilayer ( here the ambient medium itself ) , the local symmetries of the device can be exploited to design a new ptr , which would not be possible without the modification .",
    "further , the new resonant field at @xmath131 is localized on a _ different spatial scale _ , as seen in fig .  [",
    "fig4](b ) ; e.g. , the fields within the respective @xmath169 at @xmath131 and @xmath133 have similar profile , but the latter is ` squeezed ' to half the range . since the ptr at @xmath133 is invariant with respect to the gap widths @xmath165 , we thus see that the lp construction principle can be utilized for the flexible spatial design of resonantly transparent multilayer devices .",
    "having demonstrated how the concept of local symmetries enable the ` geometric ' classification of resonant scattering for photonic multilayers and the construction of ptrs , we now briefly discuss it in relation to other approaches to ptrs .",
    "as already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ introduction ] , ptrs have received considerable attention , in particular for photonic multilayers which can be realized with high accuracy and very efficient transmission characteristics .",
    "there is , indeed , a number of different theoretical approaches dealing with the occurrence of ptrs in model systems . in ref .",
    "@xcite , e.g. , ptrs arise from the intersection or touching of transmission bands in a periodic extension of a given ( aperiodic ) device with the variation of some parameter ( like the slab widths ) .",
    "another approach is to identify ptrs via the phase accumulated by the counterpropagating waves within the scatterer , which gives an interpretation of the vanishing reflection @xcite .",
    "a particularly relevant approach is given by zhukovsky in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the ptrs of combined photonic multilayers are classified with respect to the transmissions of their parts .",
    "most of these works , however , focus more on the _ conditions _ for the occurrence of ptrs and less on the understanding of their _ origin _ from fundamental principles .",
    "the latter is captured here , on the level of the field magnitude , within the classification of ptrs on ( local ) symmetry grounds .",
    "more specifically , in ref .",
    "@xcite a given photonic multilayer is composed of a left and a right part covering two domains @xmath170 and @xmath171 , respectively ( just like the domains @xmath169 and @xmath132 in fig .  [ fig3](b)(@xmath110 ) ) .",
    "the tilde here indicates that these domains , although having their boundaries at the interfaces between slabs , do _ not _ necessarily contain symmetric refractive index @xmath19 . using the airy formulas @xcite for the transmission of composite 1d systems",
    ", it can be shown that the total setup is perfectly transmitting , @xmath62 , if one the following conditions is fulfilled @xcite :    [ zhuk12 ] @xmath172    where @xmath173 are the transmission coefficients through the subdomain @xmath170 ( @xmath171 ) and @xmath174 ( @xmath175 ) are the phases of the reflection amplitude @xmath176 ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "the bar indicates that @xmath170 is traversed in the opposite ( @xmath178 ) direction .",
    "note here that , although simple and appealing , the classification of ptrs through eqs .",
    "( [ zhuk12 ] ) makes no reference to the underlying structure of the field within the multilayer .",
    "moreover , it is restricted to decompositions of the scatterer into @xmath179 domains , or to pairs of neighboring domains in an @xmath180 decomposition .    for @xmath179 domains in the decomposition of a device",
    ", it is clear that the @xmath84-ptrs defined in sec .",
    "[ classification ] , which are locally symmetric within the two domains , correspond to the first case above , eq .",
    "( [ zhuk1 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath80-ptrs then necessarily correspond to the second case , eq .",
    "( [ zhuk2 ] ) , whose fulfillment depends , however , on the particular decomposition .",
    "for instance , the @xmath80-ptr in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b)(@xmath111 ) belongs to this case , but only if the multilayer is decomposed into two parts @xmath169 and @xmath132 as @xmath181 .    for @xmath180",
    ", there is an ` overlap ' of the two cases in the classification of eqs .",
    "( [ zhuk12 ] ) , in the sense that a given ptr can belong simultaneously to both .",
    "assume , for instance , that the left part of the multilayer @xmath182 considered above is composed of two smaller parts as @xmath183 , for which the second condition , eq .",
    "( [ zhuk2 ] ) , holds ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "then , a ptr of the _ total _ multilayer fulfills eq.([zhuk1 ] ) for the decomposition @xmath185 , and eq .",
    "( [ zhuk2 ] ) for the decomposition @xmath186 ; that is , the ptr belongs to both categories for the same setup and frequency . as a consequence , eqs .",
    "( [ zhuk12 ] ) will provide the conditions for perfect transmission , but fail to reveal the ` true nature ' of the resonance . with the ` geometric ' classification pursued here ,",
    "the resonance is unambiguously identified as an @xmath84- or @xmath80-ptr , since it will follow the local symmetries of the setup or not , respectively , as explained in sec .",
    "[ classification ] .",
    "in other words , for @xmath180 decomposition domains @xmath187 ( not necessarily reflection symmetric ) there is no one - to - one mapping between the conditions in eqs .",
    "[ zhuk12 ] and the @xmath84- and @xmath80-ptrs .",
    "the two approaches can , however , be used in complementary fashion : with a simple local symmetry analysis of the device , the locally invariant @xmath188-values determine if a ptr is symmetric or asymmetric , and then the potential @xmath80-ptr parts ( i.e. , parts in the multilayer with unequal @xmath188 ) can be checked for fulfillment of eq .",
    "( [ zhuk2 ] ) .",
    "we have developed a classification of resonances occuring in wave scattering through any finite , effectively 1d medium which is globally asymmetric but decomposable into locally reflection ( or parity ) symmetric units .",
    "this was done by exdending the principle of locally invariant currents within the local parity ( lp ) formalism introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , here applied to classical light scattering . emphasizing on the manifestation of perfectly transmitting resonances ( ptrs ) , we used these local invariants , which are determined by the field at the symmetry subdomain interfaces , to achieve a geometrical representation of three classes of scattering states in the complex plane : ( i ) non - ptrs , for which the local invariants are different among the subdomains of a considered decomposition of the scattering device , forming an arbitrary trajectory in the complex plane , ( ii ) asymmetric ptrs ( @xmath80-ptrs ) , where the invariants still differ but with trajectory closing at the origin or ending at @xmath189 , where @xmath190 is the globally invariant energy density current , and ( iii ) symmetric ptrs ( @xmath84-ptrs ) , where all local invariants align at @xmath189 , with the field magnitude following the local symmetries of the device .    focusing on optical transmission through aperiodic multilayers of varying refractive index",
    ", we demonstrated the local symmetry classification of resonances in representative setups , giving insight into the structure and origin of each type of ptr .",
    "further , it was shown how simultaneous local symmetries at different scales can be utilized to design aperiodic photonic multilayers with ptrs at prescribed frequencies .",
    "we finally discussed the complementary relation of the present distinction between @xmath80- and @xmath84-ptrs to alternative approaches to perfect transmission . in conclusion",
    ", the proposed classification provides an unabmiguous distinction between resonances based on fundamental ( local ) symmetry principles , and may add to the deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying resonant scattering in complex systems .",

    "it is here explained in detail , how the concept of lp symmetry is utilized to construct ( multiple ) @xmath84-ptrs at preselected frequencies .",
    "consider a photonic multilayer setup comprised of @xmath191 homogeneous , plane slabs , like in fig .",
    "let us now assume that the total setup can be decomposed in @xmath192 different ways into locally symmetric domains ( considering , for clarity , the slabs themselves as smallest building blocks ) , so that the @xmath193-th decomposition has @xmath194 ( @xmath195 ) local symmetry subdomains @xmath196 ( @xmath197 ) .",
    "in turn , the @xmath73-th subdomain , which we call ` resonator ' , contains @xmath198 slabs ( so that @xmath199 for any @xmath193 ) .",
    "the unimodular transfer matrix ( tm ) connecting the plane wave amplitudes on either side of the @xmath73-th resonator in the @xmath193-th decomposition is given by the product ( ordered in @xmath200 ) @xmath201 where @xmath202 is the tm of the @xmath200-th slab in this resonator with refraction index @xmath203 and width @xmath204 .",
    "e.g. , for the selected @xmath193-th ( dashed ) decomposition in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , we have @xmath205 , @xmath206 , and @xmath207 ( @xmath98 ) for @xmath208 and @xmath209 .    for an @xmath84-ptr to occur for the @xmath193-th decomposition at a selected frequency @xmath210 , that is , with @xmath211 in each of its subdomains @xmath196 , the corresponding tm elements @xmath212 must vanish at @xmath213 .",
    "thus , if we want to construct @xmath84-ptrs at _ different _ frequencies @xmath214 for equally many lp decompositions @xmath215 of the _ same _ multilayer setup , the corresponding tm elements must solve the following system of @xmath216 algebraic equations : @xmath217 for all selected @xmath218 _ simultaneously _ , where @xmath219 denotes the set of slabs in the @xmath73-th resonator . with the @xmath210 fixed at desired values ,",
    "these @xmath220 algebraic equations determine equally many slab parameters ( widths and refractive indices ) , while the remaining ones are set to appropriate ( physically relevant ) values .",
    "the solution of the system thus provides us with a multilayer setup with ptrs at the prescribed frequencies .",
    "note that , if the materials and widths of different slabs are chosen equal , as is usually the case , then the number of parameters to be determined is accordingly reduced .",
    "therefore , to obtain an acceptable combination of slab parameters , a sufficiently large flexibility is needed in the _ geometry _ of the setup , that is , the number of slabs and their order in the multilayer .",
    "the key role of the local symmetries in the above procedure then lies in the reduction of the space of combinations of decompositions for which to establish perfect transmission : if we had not considered lp symmetric decompositions , then there would be vastly many combinations of decompositions for which to seek a common solution . those are now restricted by considering only locally symmetric ones , relying on the one - to - one correspondence between @xmath84-ptrs and lp symmetry .    the ` construction principle ' described above",
    "is implemented to produce the two @xmath84-ptrs in the second example of sec .",
    "[ aperiodic ] , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , as follows . as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , the multilayer setup consists of two kinds of slabs @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and two intervening gaps @xmath139 , @xmath140 of the ambient medium ( vacuum ) , with refractive indices and widths @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath221 and @xmath142 , @xmath143 , respectively . the setup is decomposed into resonators in two ways , labeled @xmath222 ( see sec .",
    "[ aperiodic ] ) , in order to produce two corresponding ptrs at the frequencies @xmath223 ,      note that , in the first case ( @xmath226 ) , the gaps @xmath146 are part of the considered resonators , and so their widths @xmath165 are relevant for the resonance condition . in the second case ( @xmath226 ) , they are not part of the resonators , so that an @xmath84-ptr in this decomposition will be retained irrespectively of the gap widths ( since there is no reflection along the gaps at any frequency ) .    according to the procedure described above , we firstly compute the tm elements ( six in total ) of each resonator in both decompositions as a function of the setup parameters and the selected frequencies ,      the conditions for @xmath84-ptrs at the desired frequencies @xmath229 and @xmath230 , eqs .",
    "( [ appendix2 ] ) , applied on each of the tm elements above , then yields a system of six algebraic equations which determines the remaining six parameters @xmath231 of the setup .",
    "we here solved for the gap widths @xmath165 having preselected @xmath232 ; conversely , we could vary the @xmath165 as input parameters and solve the system for the ( unknown ) resonant frequencies .",
    "note here that , under the restriction of having two kinds of slabs @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the two intervening gaps @xmath146 are chosen as a minimal geometric deviation from the corresponding setup used in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to get two ptrs at _ selected _ frequencies : had the gaps been absent , then all six parameters @xmath233 would have been determined from the solution ( if existent ) of six equations , that is , we could neither have selected resonant frequencies nor tuned some parameter(s ) to obtain physically acceptable values for the rest . by introducing more kinds of slabs ( i.e. , @xmath234 s and/or @xmath235 s ) in the multilayer",
