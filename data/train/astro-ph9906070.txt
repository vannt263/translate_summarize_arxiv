    "accounts of the discovery of optical and radio emission from the supernova sn has been given elsewhere ( galama et al .",
    "1998 , kulkarni et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the primary link between  and  is the coincidence of the two events in space and time ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ) . unfortunately",
    ", the coincidence window ( 16-arcmin error circle , @xmath1 1 day ) is not sufficiently small to make a firm claim of the association .",
    "bepposax nfi observations show that there are two sources , a secularly fading source coincident ( within the nfi error radius of 1.5 arcmin ) with  and a source which is not coincident with the sn and which appeared to fade by the end of the first nfi observation ( initiated 10 h after the burst and total duration of 40 h ) .",
    "the latter source has not been detected in subsequent nfi observations ( see gcn 151 for summary ; also contribution by e. pian in these proceedings ) .",
    "a simple interpretation is that the transient source is the x - ray afterglow of .",
    "another possibility is that the transient source is unrelated to .",
    "upcoming asca observations may clarify this confusing situation .",
    "what has been lost in all the exciting developments is that  is _ an unusual supernovae , regardless of its association to _ .",
    "indeed , it s claimed and controversial association tends to overshadow the unusual nature of this sn .",
    "we now exclusively focus on the radio properties of this sn .",
    "the radio observations were conducted with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) as a part of our grb effort .",
    "in figure 1 we present the up - to - date radio light curve of .",
    "the radio luminosity of  is unusually high but what really sets it apart from other radio sn is the emergence of copious radio emission at early times .",
    "supernovae expand and thus their size increases with time . thus the parameter which best distinguishes  from other radio sn is the specific intensity ( i.e. the ratio of flux to the solid angle of the source ) .",
    "it is conventional in radio astronomy to express specific intensity in units of brightness temperature and the conversion is done using the rayleigh - jeans formula .",
    "we assume that the radio emission originates from the same region as the optical emission in which case the expansion speed is 60,000 km s@xmath2 the predicted angular expansion is then @xmath3arcsec per day .",
    "such a source would be compact enough , particularly in the first two weeks , to suffer from strong scattering due to density inhomogeities in the galactic interstellar medium .",
    "in contrast to grb ( frail et al .",
    "1997 ) , only a smooth rise to a maximum was seen for the radio emission from sn .",
    "this strongly suggests that the expansion of the radio photopshere greatly exceeds that of the optical .",
    "kulkarni et al . ( 1998 ) inferred @xmath4 from the absence of refractive scintillation at 20 and 13 cm .",
    "as noted in kulkarni et al .",
    "( 1998 ) the peak brightness temperature of  is @xmath5 k. this is two orders of magnitude higher than that inferred for previously studied radio sn ( chevalier 1998 ) .",
    "the inferred brightness temperature is also in excess of the well known inverse compton limit @xmath6 k for a source radiating via the incoherent synchrotron mechanism ( kellermann & pauliny - toth 1968 , readhead 1994 ) .",
    "as pointed out by readhead ( 1994 ) , high brightness temperatures also result in exceedingly large estimates of minimum energy .",
    "the total energy of a synchrotron source is @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is referred to as the equipartition angular radius and @xmath10 is the equipartition energy which is also ( approximately ) the minimum energy .",
    "the strong dependence of @xmath11 on @xmath12 consequently means that a high price must be paid in @xmath11 for sources smaller than , or larger than @xmath9 . as noted by kulkarni et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , if the angular size used is consistent with @xmath13=60,000 km s@xmath2 then @xmath14 , and therefore the source energy would be dominated by relativistic electrons u@xmath15 erg - much larger than the total energy release in a typical supernova .",
    "therefore , the only reasonable hypothesis is to assume @xmath16 , leading to v@xmath17=1.2c-1.9c , u@xmath18 erg , and m@xmath19 m.",
    "recently , waxman &  loeb ( 1998 ) have produced an alternative _ sub - relativistic _ model to explain the radio curve shown in figure 1 . in their model ,",
    "the radio emission arises in the post - shocked gas ( shock speed of 60,000 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "they assume rapid equilibration between the electrons and protons and a modest compressed magnetic field . in this model ,",
    "the energy in the magnetic field is many orders of magnitude smaller than that in the energetic particles .",
    "the curious result is that waxman &  loeb ( 1999 ) are able to reproduce the observed spectrum ( save for a high frequency point ) and an energy estimate comparable to that of kulkarni et al .",
    "this is curious because it is a general result that the total energy is minimized only when there is equipartition between the electrons and magnetic field strength .",
    "the waxman &  loeb analysis is based on the assumption of mono - energetic electrons .",
    "sari , kulkarni &  phinney ( 1999 ) have carried out a detailed analysis using a thermal energy spectrum and find that for a non - equipartition plasma ( as envisaged by waxman & loeb ) the total energy is much higher than @xmath20 erg .",
    "thus it appears that the simplification used by waxman &  loeb does grossly underestimate the total energy .",
    "thus we conclude that either the energy of the radio emitting plasma is @xmath21 erg or that there exists a relativistic shock in this sn .",
    "we have argued above that the radio emission in the first @xmath22100 days had its origin in a mildly relativistic shock which carries only a small amount of mass ( 10@xmath23 m ) and energy ( 10@xmath24 erg ) .",
    "the bulk of the ejecta mass and energy of the sn is presumably traced by the optical photosphere .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect some late - time radio emission from this slower - moving shock as it interacts with any circumstellar material .",
    "we continue to make multi - wavelength measurements toward sn at the atca with this in mind .",
    "our results to date shown in figure 1 suggests that the power - law - like decay has persisted for at least 250 days ."
