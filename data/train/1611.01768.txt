    "one of the aims of nuclear science is to understand the properties of strongly interacting bulk matter at nuclear levels . in this regard",
    ", properties of symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) has been studied for a long time and its equation of state ( eos ) around saturation density @xmath3 is known rather well . on the other hand ,",
    "the eos of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter , particularly pure neutron matter ( pnm ) , has not been established well despite of its crucial role in both nuclear physics and astrophysics .",
    "motivated by this fact , studying the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath4 which mostly governs the pnm eos is currently an active field of research in nuclear physics .    since the symmetry energy can not be directly measured , it is of fundamental importance to identify observables which strongly correlate with @xmath4 and its density slope @xmath1 to impose constraints on these quantities .",
    "additional information on the value and density dependence of symmetry energy can be extracted from the astrophysical observations of compact objects , namely neutron stars . among the terrestrial laboratory observables ,",
    "the neutron skin thickness is widely studied @xcite during last decades .",
    "nowadays , there are many other observables such as isospin fractionation , neutron - proton differential flow , nuclear mass systematics , low - lying e1 mode , etc . , which are believed to be sensitive to symmetry energy and particularly , its density slope .",
    "we refer to references @xcite and references therein quoted for more details .",
    "density dependence of this quantity also relates the heavy - ion reactions @xcite , stability of superheavy nuclei @xcite , cooling @xcite and the mass - radius relations of neutron stars @xcite , and properties of nuclei involved in r - process nucleosynthesis @xcite .    in order to theoretically predict the symmetry energy , asymmetric nuclear matter",
    "is studied in the framework of various microscopic and phenomenological approaches by using a variety of microscopic and phenomenological two - nucleon forces and phenomenological three - body forces .",
    "such many - body techniques include the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) @xcite , its relativistic counterpart dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) @xcite , the self - consistent green s function @xcite , variational approaches @xcite , mean - field model @xcite , the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite , extended relativistic mean field ( ermf ) model @xcite , and skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf ) method @xcite .",
    "there are also some recent calculations for the symmetry energy of finite nuclei ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recent progress and challenges in both theoretically and experimentally measuring the symmetry energy and its density dependence , specially at supra nuclear densities , are also reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "despite of numerous attempts that was made to determine the symmetry energy properties , especially the value of @xmath5 and its density slope @xmath1 at saturation density @xmath3 , these quantities are still uncertain .",
    "results are strongly dependent on different experimental techniques and many - body approaches as well as nuclear interactions .",
    "especially , the density dependence of symmetry energy is poorly known .",
    "the high density prediction of many - body models for the symmetry energy are extremely diverse and sometimes contradictory . on the other hand , although the value of the symmetry energy is known to be in the range of @xmath6 mev @xcite , explorations on @xmath1 show wide variations .",
    "the obtained lower limit is @xmath7 mev @xcite and the upper one is even higher than 170 mev @xcite .",
    "however , recent surveys of analyses of terrestrial nuclear laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations found that the mean value of the slope parameter at saturation density lies in the range of @xmath8 mev @xcite .    in the present work , within the self - consistent lowest order constrained variational ( locv ) approach using the argonne v18 two - body potential @xcite supplemented by an urbana type three - body force ( uix ) @xcite , we study the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy with the focus on the effect of three - body interaction on this quantity .",
    "the locv method is a well - known many - body technique that was originally used to study the properties of cold symmetric nuclear matter @xcite by using the reid - type potential @xcite as the bare two - body interaction .",
    "later on , this approach was extended to finite temperature @xcite and also calculation of the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite , pure neutron matter @xcite , and beta- stable matter @xcite was carried out within this framework by using more sophisticated potentials . moreover ,",
    "relativistic corrections has been considered in calculating thermodynamic properties of nuclear matter within this model at both zero @xcite and finite temperature @xcite .",
    "recently , this technique has been extended by adding three - body forces to its formalism @xcite and has been used to study the structure of neutron stars @xcite as well as proto - neutron stars @xcite .",
    "although this method was successful in reproducing some properties that characterize the cold symmetric nuclear matter , namely the saturation density , saturation energy and the incompressibility , the nuclear symmetry energy obtained by this model turns out to be high and does not lie in the proper range @xcite .",
    "therefore , our goal in the present work is to correct this deficiency by revising the parametrization of uix three - body interaction .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we review briefly the adopted locv many - body approach including three - body interaction .",
    "section iii is devoted to theoretically studying the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "results and discussion are presented in sec .",
    "finally summary and conclusion are given in sec .",
    "the important role played by three - body forces ( 3bf ) in both finite nuclei and nuclear matter calculations is well known . in nuclear matter calculations , unfortunately , whatever realistic two - body force ( 2bf ) is used in a many - body approach , the saturation properties of cold symmetric nuclear matter fail to be reproduced correctly .",
    "this deficiency can be cured by inclusion of a 3bf in the nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "for this reason , the semiphenomenological uix interaction is considered in our many - body calculations .",
    "generally , the uix interaction is written as following @xcite @xmath44 with a two - pion exchange contribution as @xmath45{\\ph [ \\vec{\\tau}_{1}\\cdot \\vec{\\tau}_{2},\\vec{\\tau}_{2 } \\cdot \\vec{\\tau}_{3 } ] } ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and a shorter - range phenomenological part , @xmath46 @xmath10 and @xmath47 are adjustable parameters determined by fitting the empirical saturation density and energy of the cold snm in the locv calculations .",
    "numerals 1 , 2 , and 3 stand for three different interacting nucleons while @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath25 denotes the spin , isospin and the usual tensor operator respectively and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the yukawa and tensor functions . the one - pion exchange operator @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( 12 ) is defined as @xmath53 in two recent papers we have presented the procedure of extending the locv approach by using this kind of 3bf in its formalism at both zero @xcite and finite temperature @xcite . the 3bf is included via an effective two - body potential derived after averaging out the third particle , being weighted by the locv two - body correlation functions at fixed density @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath55 where @xmath56 . in this way ,",
    "a density - dependent effective two - body interaction is gained with the following operator structure @xmath57 explicit relations for the coefficients @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are expressed in @xcite .",
    "it is pointed out in the mentioned reference that some quantities that characterizes the saturation point of cold symmetric nuclear matter can not be produced within the locv approach even if the nuclear hamiltonian is supplemented by a 3bf .",
    "this deficiency motivated us to propose a new parametrization for uix 3bf which is based on isospin - dependent strengths .",
    "our main purpose in the present work is to construct such a 3bf in order to reach correct saturation properties within the locv model . in this",
    "regard , subsection b of sect.iv is devoted to investigating this issue in detail .",
    "the next section iii refers to the nuclear symmetry energy and other parameters characterizing saturation point of nuclear matter .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     figure 7 shows the repulsive component of uix 3bf whose strength is governed by parameter @xmath47 .",
    "once again , the isospin asymmetry is set to 1 ( the case of pnm ) . as already pointed out ,",
    "@xmath61 is a positive parameter whereas @xmath62 is a negative one which varies in the range of @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , larger negative values of @xmath62 lead to smaller @xmath47 and consequently weaker repulsive components , as is seen in fig.7 . on the other hand , point d corresponds to the lower limit predicted for @xmath62 , i.e. @xmath64 which is equivalent to the case of @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , at point d there is no repulsive component .    in fig .",
    "8(a ) the energy per nucleon of pnm is presented which is obtained by using four different effective two - body potentials plotted in figs .",
    "it is seen that the eos is strongly sensitive to the proposed parametrization of variables @xmath10 and @xmath47 .",
    "all curves with non - zero @xmath66 and @xmath62 are located below the case of @xmath67 at the whole range of density .",
    "therefore , it can be concluded that by producing an isospin - dependent structure for the 3bf parameters , our wish for gaining a softer eos for pnm can be fulfilled .",
    "figure 8(b ) represents the corresponding results for the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "a significant difference can be seen in both the value and behaviour of @xmath68 depending on the values of @xmath66 and @xmath62 .",
    "while symmetry energy obtained from @xmath67 parametrization increases with density , those of isospin - dependent @xmath10 and @xmath47 tend to saturate at large densities .",
    "this tendency decreases from point b to d. values of symmetry energy at saturation density @xmath0 , slope parameter @xmath1 , curvature parameter @xmath2 , and the isospin - dependent part of the isobaric incompressibility @xmath69 are reported in table ii for all curves . from this table it is clear that all mentioned quantities which characterize the empirical saturation point , lie well within the experimentally predicted ranges .    in fig .",
    "8(c ) the density dependence of @xmath4 predicted by locv method assuming model d of revised uix 3bf ( curve d in fig .",
    "8(b ) ) is compared with the results of other many - body approaches such as variational @xcite and bhf @xcite models using different potentials .",
    "it is seen that both the values and behaviour of @xmath4 obtained using d version of revised uix 3bf in the locv method is in agreement with results of bhf calculations with 3bf .",
    "one of the quantities which is directly affected by the symmetry energy is the relative population of protons @xmath70 in the @xmath71-stable matter which is a matter composed of an uncharged mixture of neutrons , protons , electrons , and muons in equilibrium with respect to the weak interaction .",
    "figure 9 displays this quantity as a function of total baryon density for different @xmath72 pairs , namely @xmath73 , points b to d and @xmath74 , denoted by letter e. it is seen that both the value and behaviour of the proton fraction is strongly sensitive to the values of 3bf strengths .",
    "some curves are rising in the whole baryon density range while others tend to saturate .",
    "the reason is related to the behaviour of the symmetry energy in each case . as is seen in fig .",
    "8(b ) , @xmath68 saturates for some values of @xmath66 and @xmath62 and consequently , the proton fraction shows the same behaviour , due to @xmath75 , relation valid for @xmath76 which is satisfied here ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the smaller are the symmetry energy and the slope parameter , the smaller is the density at which the proton fraction saturates .",
    "however , there exists a region in @xmath72 plane characterized by @xmath77 and @xmath78 mev ( see fig .",
    "4 ) within which proton fraction increases monotonously and does not saturate in the whole range of density up to @xmath79 if one chooses any @xmath72 pairs from this area to calculate the energy of @xmath71-stable matter .",
    "since three - body forces which are one of the key quantities in calculations of the symmetry energy , contribute only to the potential part of @xmath68 , it seems valuable to separate the symmetry energy into its kinetic , @xmath80 , and potential , @xmath81 , parts .",
    "results of such separation is reported in table iii for different @xmath72 pairs at saturation density @xmath82 .",
    "the kinetic term of the symmetry energy is , to a very good approximation , equal to the difference in the kinetic energy between pnm and snm , calculated using a simple fermi gas model .",
    "therefore , this term gives the same contribution for all parametrizations of 3bf . in the case of @xmath67 ,",
    "the large contribution comes from the potential part , and this causes both the symmetry energy and its slope not to lie in the experimental range .",
    "this problem is resolved for parametrizations b , c , d by considering isospin - dependent parametrization for the 3bf coefficients . as can be concluded in fig .",
    "4 , the least value of @xmath81 corresponds to point b.    in the locv approach one has access to the separate contributions of partial waves energies in the correlated many - body state .",
    "table iv shows the partial wave decomposition of the potential part of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 up to @xmath83 for different parameters of 3bf .",
    "note that a number of partial waves , namely @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , does not contribute to neutron matter .",
    "therefore , contributions from these waves to the symmetry energy are the same for all allowed values of @xmath66 and @xmath62 . for the six remaining partial waves ,",
    "all quantities @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 decrease ( or increase ) monotonically from point d to b. the only exception is @xmath88 channel in which @xmath0 increases from d to b while @xmath1 and @xmath2 show opposite behaviour . it can be concluded from this table that the @xmath89 channel gives the major contribution to @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it is also observed that the @xmath90 ( spin triplet ) and @xmath91 ( isospin singlet ) channel gives the largest contribution to both symmetry energy and its slope for all values of @xmath66 and @xmath62 .",
    "similar features have been reported in @xcite and references therein .",
    "we expect that for @xmath92 ( _ outer core _",
    ", see e.g. @xcite ) ns matter is an uniform , electrically neutral @xmath93 plasma in @xmath71-equilibrium .",
    "this is also the simplest ( minimal ) model of the _ inner core _ of ns ( @xmath94 ) . using our 2bf+3bf nuclear hamiltonian",
    ", we calculated the equation of state ( eos ) and composition of ns core .",
    "beta equilibrium implies specific fractions of @xmath95 in ns matter constituents , @xmath96 .",
    "cooling rate of ns core dramatically depends on @xmath97 .",
    "namely , if @xmath98 , where @xmath99 ( depending on the precentage of muons ) , then powerful direct urca ( durca ) process of neutrino emission can act , leading to a fast ns cooling @xcite(for review of neutrino cooling of ns see , e.g. @xcite ) . as we see in fig.9 , in the case of our 2bf+3bf hamiltionian",
    ", 3bf decides whether the durca process is acting in ns core ( this was already remarked in @xcite ) .",
    "making 3bf less repulsive is crucial for getting correct values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , this leads to a softer eos for ns cores . as a consequence ,",
    "the maximum allowable mass for ns for the 2bf+3bf hamiltonian , @xmath100 , decreases ( in what follows we neglect the effect of rotation on @xmath100 , which for the frequencies of recently discovered @xmath101 pulsars @xcite is very small ) .",
    "for all models of our revised uix 3bf we get @xmath102 , consistently with @xcite .",
    "this subsection is but a brief report on the effects of a revised 3bf on ns models .",
    "more detailed presentation will be given in a separate paper .",
    "the extended locv formalism including the uix 3bf force is used in order to study the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy at zero temperature .",
    "the av18 potential is used as the bare two - body interaction .",
    "it is shown that although inclusion of 3bf is successful in reproducing the saturation point properties , namely saturation density and saturation energy as well as the isobaric incompressibility , it fails to predict a reasonable value for both symmetry energy at normal density and its slope . in order to correct this deficiency , a revised version of 3bf",
    "is proposed which is based on an isospin - dependent parametrization of coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath47 in the uix model . to analyse the effect of the new parametrization ,",
    "different components of the revised 3bf are compared to those of the old one .",
    "effect of the new parametrization of 3bf on density dependence of symmetry energy , its value at saturation density and its slope and curvature is also studied .",
    "it is shown that using this kind of 3bf in the locv formalism results in acceptable values for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath69 . moreover ,",
    "separate contributions of partial waves energies in the potential part of symmetry energy are reported .",
    "it is found that the @xmath90 and @xmath91 channel , and particularly the @xmath84 partial wave , give the largest contribution to both symmetry energy and its slope for all values of @xmath66 and @xmath62 .",
