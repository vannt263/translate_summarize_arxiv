    "if the coupling between  @xmath1 limit cycle oscillators is sufficiently weak then the dynamics can be approximated by a phase reduction .",
    "based on the seminal work of kuramoto  @xcite to study the onset of synchronization in coupled oscillators  @xcite , phase oscillators whose phases @xmath2 of oscillator  @xmath3 evolve according to @xmath4 where  @xmath5 is the natural frequency of the oscillators and interaction is determined by the @xmath6-periodic coupling ( or phase interaction ) function @xmath7 have been studied extensively  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics given by  , the kuramoto ",
    "sakaguchi equations  @xcite , are degenerate : the dynamics are effectively two - dimensional and the only attractors are full synchrony or the splay phase oscillation depending on the value of  @xmath8  @xcite . thus , more complicated dynamics in   such as chaos is only possible for more general forms of coupling , for example by considering coupling functions  @xmath9 with higher harmonics . for @xmath0 phase oscillators  the smallest number where chaos can occur  no sign of chaos was found for coupling functions with two harmonics  @xcite and the only known example of a coupling function giving rise to chaotic attractors has four nontrivial harmonics  @xcite . by contrast , two harmonics are sufficient to find chaos in networks   of @xmath10 phase oscillators  @xcite .    recently , ashwin and rodrigues  @xcite showed that while a phase reduction of a generic fully symmetric system of oscillators close to a hopf bifurcation to lowest order has the form  , the phase dynamics to the next order also contain higher order interaction terms that depend on three and four phases .",
    "more precisely , up to next order we have for coupling @xmath11 an invariant torus with phase dynamics given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a symmetric function in the phases , the coupling function  @xmath14 has nontrivial first and second harmonics and the coupling functions @xmath15 that determine the nonpairwise interaction have a nontrivial first harmonic .",
    "nonpairwise interaction in the phase model leads to novel nontrivial dynamical phenomena  @xcite ; for example emergent quasiperiodicity of the mean field  @xcite which has been investigated explicitly  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the dynamics of phase oscillator systems   that arise through the phase reduction of fully symmetric oscillators close to a hopf bifurcation .",
    "in particular we discuss existence and stability of the in - phase ( fully synchronous ) and of the splay phase ( rotating waves ) solutions and calculate some bifurcations .",
    "the main result of this paper is to show that there are parameter values for coupling functions that give rise to positive maximal lyapunov exponents for the dynamics of the phase differences of @xmath0 and @xmath10 oscillators , the former being the smallest number of oscillators for which chaotic dynamics in the truncated phase equations   can occur . in particular , we show evidence that chaos arises through period doubling and a shilnikov scenario involving a saddle focus .",
    "finally , we discuss the relationship of the chaos in the phase reduction and the dynamics of the full system of fully symmetric oscillators close to a hopf bifurcation which can give rise to chaos even for three oscillators  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : review ] we review the results about the phase reduction of generic systems of oscillators with full symmetry close to a hopf bifurcation  @xcite . in section  [ sec : basicsnonpairwise ] we study basic properties of the resulting phase equations which we subsequently apply to small networks in section  [ sec : smallnets ] . in section  [ sec : chaos ]",
    "we give concrete examples of coupling functions that give rise to chaotic dynamics with positive maximal lyapunov exponent before giving some concluding remarks .",
    "while the phase reduction of a system of weakly coupled oscillators close to a hopf bifurcation yields phase dynamics with pairwise interaction terms to lowest order , it was recently shown in  @xcite that interaction terms of up to four phases can appear to next order if the coupling is very small compared to the distance from hopf bifurcation . in this section",
    "we summarize these results and fix the notation .",
    "suppose we have  @xmath1 identical , symmetrically coupled dynamical systems with state  @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) close to a hopf bifurcation .",
    "write @xmath18 . using equivariant bifurcation theory @xcite it is possible to write the system on a center manifold @xmath19 where in the case @xmath20 the center manifold in each coordinate @xmath21 is parametrized by @xmath22 .",
    "this system on the center manifold is @xmath23 where @xmath24 and we note the right hand sides can be chosen to be of smoothness  @xmath25 , with  @xmath26 arbitrarily large , in a neighborhood of the bifurcation .",
    "the conditions for hopf bifurcation mean that for we have @xmath27 and the derivative @xmath28 has a pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues  @xmath29 that pass transversely through the imaginary axis with non - zero speed on changing @xmath30 . let @xmath31 denote the group of permutations of  @xmath1 symbols which acts on  @xmath32 by permutation of coordinates , that is , if @xmath33 then @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",

    "because of the phase shift symmetry , the jacobian of the vector field @xmath97 has a zero eigenvalue with eigenvector @xmath98 .",

    "we can compute , for @xmath100 , that @xmath106 note that although this is not clear from this expression , there should be circulant structure @xmath107 for this matrix which implies that the non - zero eigenvalues will generically be complex except ( in the case of @xmath1 even ) for a single real eigenvalue .",
    "we do not compute these eigenvalues in their full generality but give them for the special cases @xmath108 in the next section .",
    "since the nonpairwise coupling involves combinations of three and four phases , the dynamics for @xmath109 and @xmath71 oscillators reduce to coupling of simpler form . in particular , for @xmath109 oscillators   reduces to pairwise coupling   with coupling function @xmath110 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath71 we can express the contributions of  @xmath111 to the dynamics in terms of just pairwise and three - phase interactions .",
    "consequently , @xmath0 is the simplest case where all higher order interaction terms in   are nontrivial .    in the following , we consider coupling functions of the form of where @xmath30 is fixed , i.e. , @xmath112 where for general @xmath1 the function  @xmath14 determines pairwise , @xmath113 triplet and @xmath114 quadruplet interaction .",

    "we show that symmetrical phase oscillator networks with coupling that involves nonpairwise interaction can exhibit chaotic dynamics with coupling functions that only contain two nontrivial harmonics . as demonstrated in section  [ sec : chaos ] , this is also the case for a network of @xmath0 oscillators , the smallest networks that can support chaotic dynamics .",
    "by contrast , for networks of four oscillators with pairwise interaction the only known example of a coupling function that gives rise to chaotic dynamics has four nontrivial harmonics  @xcite .",
    "coupling functions with two harmonics are sufficient for larger networks  @xcite .",
    "the emergence of positive lyapunov exponents for nonpairwise coupling begs to be explored further .",
    "our results suggest that chaos can arise through period doubling and  modulo the symmetry on the invariant region  in a shilnikov scenario involving a saddle focus on the boundary of the canonical invariant region .",
    "however , the boundaries of parameter values giving rise to positive  @xmath146 apparent in figures  [ fig : chaosn4](b ) and  [ fig : chaosn5](b ) remain to be traced out .",
    "moreover , positive lyapunov exponents arise in the same region of parameter space .",
    "is it possible to find a ( set of ) coupling functions that give chaotic dynamics for any  @xmath141 ?",
    "our results clarify the role amplitude dynamics in the emergence of chaos for oscillators beyond the weak coupling limit .",
    "while it has been argued that amplitude degrees of freedom are crucial for the emergence of chaotic dynamics in fully symmetric coupled oscillators  @xcite , our results suggest that these additional degrees of freedom are not necessary for four or more oscillators : chaos can arise in the phase reduction of symmetrically coupled oscillators close to a hopf bifurcation in the weak coupling limit through nonpairwise coupling .",
    "note that higher order expansions of the phase dynamics for symmetric oscillators close to a hopf bifurcation may induce interaction terms involving five or more phases . these may affect the qualitative dynamics of the phase reduction for @xmath166 oscillators but reduce to interactions of four phases in networks of @xmath0 oscillators ; cf .  section  [ sec : smallnets ] .",
    "by contrast , the invariant torus in the weak coupling limit for three oscillators does not support any chaotic dynamics due to the continuous phase shift symmetry .",
    "thus , chaotic dynamics for three symmetrically coupled oscillators  @xcite can only occur in the full system for time scales where the weak coupling approximation breaks down .",
    "nonpairwise interaction between phase oscillators also facilitates the emergence of chaotic weak chimeras , i.e. , dynamically invariant sets on which oscillators are locally frequency synchronized . while recent results on the existence of chaotic weak chimeras relied on pairwise interactions and coupling functions with four nontrivial harmonics  @xcite , nonpairwise interaction yields another mechanism to construct such solutions",
    "moreover , as nonpairwise coupling arises in a phase reduction of more general oscillators our results provide a link between chaotic weak chimeras and chimera states found for more general oscillators beyond the weak coupling limit  @xcite  see also  @xcite .",
    "higher order interactions that involve nonpairwise terms also arise in oscillators with mean field coupling  @xcite and are of interest for applications .",
    "in fact , methods for the analysis of time series of oscillatory data explicitly address the problem of reconstructing higher order terms  @xcite .",
    "thus , we anticipate that a detailed understanding of the dynamical effects induced by general nonpairwise coupling will give additional insights into the analysis of real - world networks of oscillatory units with generic coupling .",
