    "baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1is one representative of the material class @xmath8v@xmath0o@xmath1with earth - alkaline metals @xmath9  sr , ba and different divalent transition metals on the @xmath10 site . commonly , these compounds have a similar tetragonal crystal structure , which contains screw chains of @xmath10o@xmath11 octahedra running along the @xmath12 axis .",
    "these screw chains are separated by the non - magnetic @xmath13 ions and vo@xmath14 tetrahedra ( with nonmagnetic v@xmath15 ) .",
    "depending on the transition metal @xmath16  cu , ni , co , or mn , quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin systems with different spin quantum numbers are realized , _",
    "e.g. _ , dimerized @xmath17 heisenberg chains for bacu@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite , @xmath18 haldane chains for srni@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite , or @xmath19 heisenberg chains for srmn@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "for co@xmath7 with @xmath20 , the partial occupation of the @xmath21 orbitals results in an effective orbital moment @xmath22 and the spin - orbit coupling between @xmath23 and the total spin @xmath24 is typically in the same energy range as the crystal - field splitting of the @xmath21 orbitals due to a distortion of the coo@xmath11 octahedra . as a consequence , the co@xmath7 magnetic moments are often strongly anisotropic  @xcite .",
    "for example , an easy - axis ( or ising ) anisotropy is observed in k@xmath25cof@xmath14 with compressed cof@xmath11 octahedra  @xcite , while an easy - plane ( or xy ) anisotropy is present in la@xmath26sr@xmath27coo@xmath14 with elongated coo@xmath11 octahedra  @xcite . in the case of baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 , the coo@xmath11 octahedra are significantly compressed along the @xmath12 axis and a strong ising anisotropy with @xmath12 as the magnetic easy axis is reported  @xcite .",
    "consequently , baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1represents a quasi-1d effective ising @xmath17 chain described by the @xmath28 hamiltonian @xmath29 where @xmath30  k , @xmath31 and the anisotropic @xmath32 factors @xmath33 and @xmath34 have been derived from an analysis of the low - temperature magnetization curves  @xcite . at @xmath35",
    "k , baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1orders antiferromagnetically due to the presence of finite interchain couplings . as expected from the ising anisotropy , the ordered moments point along the @xmath12 direction . within the chains ( @xmath36 ) nearest - neighbor ( nn ) spins are antiparallel to each other , but perpendicular to the chains , _",
    "i.e. _ within the ( 001 ) planes , nn spins point either in the same or in the opposite direction  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the ordered phase typically contains different magnetic domains , which are rotated by 90@xmath37 and translated by @xmath38 with respect to each other  @xcite .",
    "recently , we found that the antiferromagnetic ordering of baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1is accompanied by a small orthorhombic distortion within the @xmath39 planes , which can be traced back to a finite magnetoelastic coupling of the interchain couplings  @xcite .",
    "thus , magnetic and structural domains are coupled to each other and , in fact , the under ambient conditions twinned crystals of baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1can be , at least partially , detwinned either by cooling under uniaxial pressure or by applying a magnetic field along the [ 100 ] direction  @xcite",
    ".    a further consequence of the ising anisotropy in baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1is its strongly anisotropic temperature @xmath40 magnetic - field phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields along the easy axis , _ i.e. _ @xmath41 , strongly suppress @xmath42and above about 4  t an incommensurate ( ic ) magnetic order is observed with a weakly field - dependent transition temperature of @xmath43  k. within this ic phase , there are some experimental indications for the occurrence of additional phase transitions  @xcite , but this issue is not settled yet .",
    "concerning the field direction @xmath44 , a very weak decrease of @xmath45  k / t has been originally reported for the field range up to 9  t  @xcite , which roughly corresponds to the observed saturation field of about 40  t measured at @xmath46  k  @xcite .",
    "recently , however , it has been realized that this very weak field influence is only present for @xmath47 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "rotating the field by @xmath48 within the @xmath39 plane , _",
    "i.e. _ a field @xmath49 , causes a much stronger decrease of @xmath42and it is completely suppressed above about 10  t. as was shown in ref .",
    ", such an in - plane anisotropy can be explained by a small tilt ( @xmath50 ) of the local easy axis of the coo@xmath11 octahedra with respect to the @xmath12 axis . due to the @xmath51 screw axis along @xmath12 , the direction of the local easy axis changes with a four - step periodicity between neighboring co ions along @xmath12 . as a consequence , applied external magnetic fields",
    "cause staggered effective fields in the transverse directions . here",

    "is related to structural distortions , we studied the influence of a partial substitution of the ba@xmath7 ions by smaller sr@xmath7 ions on the temperature @xmath40 magnetic - field phase diagram . a further motivation to investigate the substitution series ba@xmath4sr@xmath5co@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1was the fact that there are only few studies on srco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the crystal structures of both end members are very similar , but baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1is centrosymmetric ( space group @xmath61 no .",

    "concerning the magnetic properties of srco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 , the magnetic susceptibility in the high - temperature paramagnetic phase has a similar ising anisotropy to that of baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "moreover , srco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1also shows nel order at an only weakly reduced @xmath63  k. despite these similarities , it was concluded that the temperature @xmath40 magnetic - field phase diagrams of baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1and srco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1would be drastically different , because in srco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1a two - step transition in low fields and a rather moderate anisotropy of @xmath60 between @xmath64 and @xmath65 had been observed in refs .  .",
    "however , such a two - step transition was not confirmed in a more recent study  @xcite and , as will be shown below , the seemingly very different anisotropies of @xmath60 reported for the two end members of ba@xmath4sr@xmath5co@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite essentially result from the in - plane anisotropy of @xmath66 , which has been discovered only recently @xcite .",
    "this in - plane anisotropy is present for all @xmath67 and systematically increases as a function of increasing sr content .",
    "in addition , we also studied the influence of in - chain substitutions by partially replacing the effective ising @xmath17 co@xmath7 ion by transition metal ions with different spin quantum numbers ( cu@xmath7 , ni@xmath7 , mn@xmath7 ) or by nonmagnetic mg@xmath7 .",
    "the resulting change of @xmath42 in zero magnetic field is rather different , but in all cases the magnetic anisotropies are essentially preserved .",

    "the three - dimensional ordering of ising ( as well as , _",
    "e.g. _ , heisenberg or xxz ) spin chains requires a finite interchain coupling , but the actual value of @xmath42depends only weakly on the interchain coupling  @xcite . because the sr substitution mainly changes the @xmath82 axis , _ i.e. _ the interchain distance ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gks ] ) , one may expect a stronger influence on the interchain couplings , while the intrachain coupling should remain essentially unchanged . this is supported by the observation that the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility is essentially preserved over the entire ba@xmath4sr@xmath5co@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1series in the temperature range well above @xmath42 , where the interchain couplings are of minor importance .    concerning the in - chain substitutions , one can also expect little changes of @xmath106 in the higher temperature range , where the correlation length @xmath107 is significantly shorter than the average distance of 20 lattice sites for the 5% substitution level .",
    "however , a significant influence is expected for @xmath42 , because the spin chains are cut into finite chain segments and thus the low - temperature increase of @xmath107 is limited , if the intrachain magnetic coupling via the substituted @xmath10 ion is effectively blocked  @xcite .",
    "the degree of ( de-)coupling of the finite chain segments depends on the magnetic properties of the substituting ion @xmath10 , which obviously influences the nn intrachain exchange .",
    "in addition , the next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) intrachain exchange contributes and an effective coupling of the finite chain segments via the neighboring chains due to the finite interchain coupling might be important , too . because the nonmagnetic mg causes a strong suppression of @xmath42 , while the magnetic mn and ni ions have almost no influence we conclude that in baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1the nn interaction is the dominant coupling mechanism of the finite chain segments .",
    "moreover , the intermediate suppression of @xmath42for the cu substitution suggests that the coupling via this @xmath17 ion is already considerably reduced whereas there seems to be little change when the @xmath24 co@xmath7 ions are replaced by @xmath18 ni@xmath7 or @xmath19 mn@xmath7 .",
    "we think that this difference results from the fact that co@xmath7 , ni@xmath7 , and mn@xmath7 have half - filled @xmath108 orbitals , whereas there is only a single hole in the @xmath108 orbital of cu@xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , the quantum fluctuations are significantly larger for @xmath17 than for higher spin quantum numbers .    because the interchain distance considerably decreases with increasing sr content",
    ", one may expect increasing interchain exchange couplings , which seems to be in conflict with the observed weakly decreasing @xmath42 .",
    "as mentioned above , however , in the ordered phase of baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1nn spins in the ( 001 ) planes point either parallel or antiparallel to each other , that is , the symmetry of the magnetic structure is less than tetragonal  @xcite . as we have discussed in more detail in ref .",
    ", the magnetic structure of baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1typically arises when there is a frustration between nn ( @xmath109 ) and nnn interchain interactions ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "thus , our data suggest that the decreasing interchain distance in the ba@xmath4sr@xmath5co@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1series changes @xmath109 and @xmath110 in a way that the resulting frustration increases , which in turn decreases the effective interchain interaction and therefore causes a weakly decreasing @xmath42with increasing @xmath67 .",
    "neutron scattering data of the magnetic structure are available only for baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite . for srco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 , a different magnetic structure with a non - collinear spin arrangement",
    "was proposed  @xcite . however , this suggestion is based on a very limited set of magnetization data and was questioned by a more recent magnetization study  @xcite . one characteristic feature of the magnetic structure of baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1is the presence of 2 types of antiferromagnetic domains and when cooling under ambient conditions the crystals are heavily twinned . as we have shown in ref .  , the magnetoelastic coupling of the in - plane couplings @xmath109 and @xmath110 causes a small orthorhombic splitting @xmath111 . here ,",

    "such a rearrangement , and thus the continuous variation of @xmath136 , will be significantly disturbed if the spin chains are effectively cut into finite chain segments , as it is the case due to the substitution of co@xmath7 by non - magnetic mg@xmath7 ions .",

    "moreover , we observe rather weak ( typically less than @xmath158  k ) changes of the zero - field nel temperatures @xmath42for almost all substitutions . a significantly larger decrease of @xmath42is induced by the partial substitution of co@xmath7 by non - magnetic mg@xmath7 , which can be traced back to an effective cutting of the 1d chains into finite chain segments .",

    "the twinning ratio of these domains can be influenced by uniaxial pressure ( or magnetic field ) , what is clearly seen in high - resolution data of the macroscopic thermal expansion .",
    "this very characteristic feature of the magnetic structure of baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1is also observed over the full range of sr substitution as well as for various in - chain substitutions .",
    "this gives clear evidence that the magnetic structure is essentially preserved for all these substitutions and contradicts earlier assumptions  @xcite of a different magnetic structure in srco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "we suspect that the weakly decreasing @xmath42with increasing sr content arises from an increasing frustration of the interchain couplings .    concerning the temperature @xmath40 magnetic - field phase diagrams",
    ", we also find that all the basic features are essentially preserved for the different kinds of substitutions .",
    "for @xmath93 , the region of the antiferromagnetic phase roughly scales with the magnitude of the zero - field @xmath42 . above critical fields",
    "@xmath160 ranging from about 2 to 4  t , our data yield some indirect evidence for the presence of incommensurate phases , but this latter point needs further verification by diffraction techniques . for @xmath44 , we observe that the pronounced in - plane anisotropy between @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath128 $ ] , which has been detected only recently in the parent compound baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite , is also present in the substituted materials .",
    "in particular , we find that this in - plane anisotropy systematically increases with increasing sr content . following the interpretation of ref .",
    "that the in - plane anisotropy results from staggered @xmath32 tensors due to periodically tilted local quantization axes , an increasing tilt angle would naturally explain the enhanced in - plane anisotropy for the sr - substituted samples . as an outlook , we would like to emphasize that most of our conclusions are based on macroscopic quantities and various aspects should therefore be studied in more detail by microscopic techniques . in baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 , for example , the proposed staggered fields for @xmath44 should be verified by the observation of transverse staggered moments , which differ for large magnetic fields applied either along [ 100 ] or [ 110 ] .",
