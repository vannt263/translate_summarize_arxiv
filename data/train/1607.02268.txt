    "the statistics of minkowski functionals , including the euler number , as well as extrema counts requires the knowledge of the one - point joint probability distribution function ( jpdf ) @xmath1 of the field @xmath2 ( assumed to have zero mean ) , its first , @xmath3 , and second , @xmath4 , derivatives .",
    "let us consider a random field @xmath2 defined on a 2d sphere @xmath0 of radius @xmath5 represented as the expansion in spherical harmonics @xmath6 where for the gaussian statistically homogeneous and isotropic field random coefficients @xmath7 are uncorrelated with @xmath8-independent variances @xmath9 of each harmonic @xmath10 the variance of the field is then given by @xmath11    when considering derivatives in the curved space , we use covariant derivatives @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 where it will be seen immediately that mixed version for the second derivatives is the most appropriate choice .",

    "the coefficients of expansion @xmath37 are related ( and for the first non - gaussian order @xmath38 are equal ) to the moments of the field and its derivatives ( see @xcite for details ) .    up to now our considerations",
    "are practically identical to the theory in the cartesian space , which facilitates using many of the cartesian calculations .",
    "we stress again the only , but important , difference being @xmath22 .",

    "we introduce the spectral parameter @xmath39 that describes this difference @xmath40    let us review the scales and parameters that the theory has . as in the flat space , we have two scales @xmath41 and @xmath42 and the spectral parameter @xmath43 ( which also describes correlation between the field and its second derivatives ) . on a sphere",

    "statistics of the first two do not depend on the second derivatives of the field , and thus are identical on @xmath0 and the 2d cartesian space . here , for completeness",

    "@xmath70 it is appropriate to quote the total euler characteristic in the whole volume , which , recalling the relation between @xmath47 , @xmath39 , @xmath5 and @xmath46 becomes @xmath71 which explicitly demonstrates that if @xmath72 .",
    "i.e the whole space is included in the excursion set , the total euler characteristic is equal to that of a sphere , @xmath73 , as expected .",

    "the procedure is similar to that in cartesian space as elaborated in detail in @xcite and which led to the complete expression for the euler characteristic to all orders first reported in @xcite .",
    "indeed , the quantity @xmath63 that we then average over the whole range of @xmath20 can be rewritten as @xmath75 .",
    "thus only the @xmath76 terms of the expansion , i.e containing @xmath77 or @xmath78 , do not vanish after integration . here",

    "in 2d , assuming @xmath84 , @xmath85 for maxima , @xmath86 for minima , and @xmath87 for saddle points .",
    "in particular , a well - known topological relation gives @xmath88    the integral eq .  ( [ eq : ext_int ] ) has a very transparent form when the hessian is described in invariant variables .",
    "it is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi_gauss ] ) , except that the limits of integration over @xmath18 are partitioned into the regions of fixed sign of the determinant @xmath63 .",

    "calculations for the differential density of extremal points , @xmath92 , can be carried out analytically even for the general expression eq .",

    "the result is @xmath94 where we immediately see that @xmath95 as expected .",
    "the total number of saddles , as well as of all the extremal points , @xmath96 , are preserved at first order ( the latter following from the former ) , but the symmetry between the minima and the maxima is broken .",
    "it is instructive to look how the gaussian extrema counts are modified by the properties of spherical space when the curvature radius is large relative to the typical extrema separation scale @xmath46 , i.e when @xmath39 is small .",
    "up to first order in @xmath39 @xmath97 this shows that being on a sphere increases the number density of maxima and minima , but decreases ( and in a more significant way ) the number of saddles .",
    "incidently , assuming large - angle cmb power spectrum , truncated at @xmath98 gives @xmath99 , i.e 1% correction to the count of extrema relative to the flat - sky approximation ."

    "<S> the theory leverages symmetry of isotropic statistics such as minkowski functionals and extrema counts to develop post- gaussian expansion of the statistics in orthogonal polynomials of invariant descriptors of the field , its first and second derivatives . </S>",
    "<S> the application of the approach to 2d fields defined on a spherical sky was suggested , but never rigorously developed . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present such development treating effects of the curvature and finiteness of the spherical space @xmath0 exactly , without relying on the flat - sky approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we present minkowski functionals , including euler characteristic and extrema counts to the first non - gaussian correction , suitable for weakly non - gaussian fields on a sphere , of which cmb is the prime example .    </S>",
    "<S> random fields are ubiquitous phenomena in physics appearing in areas ranging from turbulence to the landscape of string theories . in cosmology , the sky - maps of the polarized cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation  a focal topic of current research  is a prime example of such 2d random fields , specified on @xmath0 spherical space . </S>",
    "<S> modern view of the cosmos , developed primarily through statistical analysis of these fields , points to a universe that is statistically homogeneous and isotropic with a hierarchy of structures arising from small gaussian fluctuations of quantum origin . </S>",
    "<S> while the gaussian limit provides the fundamental starting point in the study of random fields @xcite , non - gaussian features of the cmb fields are of great interest . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , cmb inherits a high level of gaussianity from initial fluctuations , but small non - gaussian deviations may provide a unique window into the details of processes in the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> the search for the best methods to analyze non - gaussian random fields is ongoing .    in the paper @xcite the general invariant based formalism for computing topological and geometrical characteristics of non gaussian fields </S>",
    "<S> was presented . </S>",
    "<S> the general formula for the euler characteristic to all orders has been derived , which encompasses the well known first order correction of @xcite , and which was later confirmed to the next order by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this work was followed by the detailed exposition of the theory in 2d and 3d flat ( cartesian ) space in @xcite and @xcite , and generalized to the 3d redshift space where isotropy is broken in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the goal of this paper is to extend these results to the fields defined on a finite curved spherical space @xmath0 without reliance on the flat field ( small angle ) approximation . </S>",
    "<S> while these proceedings were being prepared , similar work has been done for statistics of peaks in the gaussian case within @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> our focus is on non - gaussian corrections . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how to compute exact minkowski functionals for the excursion sets of a scalar field on a @xmath0 sphere to all orders in non - gaussian expansion and provide an explicit expression for the euler characteristic to first order . </S>",
    "<S> expressions for the total extrema counts to the first non - gaussian order are also given , while analytical formulas for differential extrema counts to the same order will be published elsewhere due to their length . </S>",
    "<S> these results have a direct relevance to cmb data analysis . </S>"
