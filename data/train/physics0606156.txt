    "of alternating magnetic fields and the associated eddy currents is important for the design of various electrical machines and the magnetic field inductors used for heating , melting , stirring , shaping or levitation of metallic or semiconducting materials .",
    "although the distribution of electromagnetic fields is , in principle , completely described by the maxwell equations , only in very few simple cases these equations can be solved analytically . usually a numerical approach is needed .",
    "most of the approaches used for the solution of electromagnetic field problems are based on finite difference ( fdm ) or finite element methods ( fem ) .",
    "the main advantage of these methods is their capability to deal with complex geometrical configurations usually encountered in practical applications .",
    "however , these methods involve a solution for the fields in the free space which is often unbounded and , thus , may require considerable additional computer resources as well as a special numerical treatment at the outer open boundary @xcite . on the other hand , in many applications such as , for example , electromagnetic heating and hardening of workpieces or the stirring of molten metals , only the eddy currents and magnetic fields in the conducting medium are needed .",
    "there are several approaches avoiding the solution of the magnetic field in the free space .",
    "a first kind of those approaches uses the biot - savart law , to reduce the problem to a volume integral equation @xcite .",

    "this approach reduces to a boundary integral equation @xcite . on the other hand , there are approaches using the boundary impedance condition to approximate the field distribution in the conductor at small skin - depth in combination with a fem solution in the free space @xcite .    our approach is to reduce the problem to a boundary integral equation not only for the free space but also for the interior of the conductor that would be applicable regardless of the relative thickness of the skin - layer .",
    "this is possible for a conductor with uniform electric and magnetic properties when the field distribution inside the conductor is described by linear pdes with constant coefficients admitting an analytic fundamental solution , _",
    "i.e. , _ the green s function .",
    "advantage of this approach is a consideration of the conductor surface only .",
    "thus , the dimensionality of the problem is reduced by one that renders this method particularly suited for the analysis of complicated geometrical configurations . on the other hand , this geometrical simplification comes at the price of an increased algebraic and numeric complexity due to the calculation of the axisymmetric green s function .",
    "similar approaches have already been considered for 2d @xcite and 3d @xcite problems which both are considerably algebraically simpler than the axisymmetric problem considered here .",
    "there is an analytic solution for the green s function for the 2d case and a point - source green s function is used in the 3d case while there is no simple analytic solution for green s function in the axisymmetric case .",
