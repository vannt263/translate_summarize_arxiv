    "<S> a simple cellular automata model for a two - group war over the same `` territory '' is presented . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that a qualitative advantage is not enough for a minority to win . a spatial organization as well a definite degree of aggressiveness are instrumental to overcome a less fitted majority . </S>",
    "<S> the model applies to a large spectrum of competing groups : smoker - non smoker war , epidemic spreading , opinion formation , competition for industrial standards and species evolution . in the last case </S>",
    "<S> , it provides a new explanation for punctuated equilibria .    </S>",
    "<S> .5cm*pacs : * 01.75+m , 05.50+q , 89.90+n .5 cm    physics has dealt with quite a success in describing and understanding collective behavior in matter . very recently </S>",
    "<S> many physicists have used basic concepts and techniques from the physics of collective disorder to study a large spectrum of problems outside the usual field of physics such as social behavior  @xcite , group decision making  @xcite , financial systems  @xcite and multinational organizations  @xcite . see  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a review of these applications .    </S>",
    "<S> a few years ago , galam has developed a hierarchical voting model based on the democratic use of majority rule  @xcite . in the simplest case of two competing parties @xmath0 and @xmath1 with respective support of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that , for the @xmath1 , winning the elections at the top of the hierarchy ( i.e. after several tournaments ) does not depend only on @xmath4 but also on the existence of some local biases . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in the case of voting cells of four persons , a bias is introduced ( usually in favor of the leading party , e.g. @xmath1 ) to solve the @xmath5-@xmath6 situations . then , the critical threshold of support for the ruling party to win can be as low as @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the model showed how a majority up to @xmath8 can self - eliminate while climbing up the hierarchy , using locally the democratic majority voting rule . </S>",
    "<S> this self - elimination occurs within only few hierarchical levels .    </S>",
    "<S> following this previous study , we address here the universal and generic problem of the competing fight between two different groups over a fixed area . </S>",
    "<S> we present a `` voter model '' which describes the dynamical behavior of a population with bimodal conflicting interests and study the conditions of extinction of one of the initial groups .    </S>",
    "<S> this model can be thought of as describing the smoker - non smoker fight : in a small group of persons , a majority of smokers will usually convince the few others to smoke and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> the point is really when an equal number of smokers and non - smokers meet . in that case </S>",
    "<S> , it may be assumed that a social trend will decide between the two attitudes . in the us , smoking is viewed as a disadvantage whereas , in france , it is rather well accepted . in other words , there is a bias that will select the winner party in an even situation . in our example , whether one studies the french or us case , the bias will be in favor of the smokers or the non - smokers , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the same mechanism can be associated with the problem of competing standards ( for instance pc versus macintosh for computer systems or vhs versus beta mag for video systems ) . the choice of one or the other standard is often driven by the opinion of the majority of people one meets . </S>",
    "<S> but , when the two competing systems are equally represented , the intrinsic quality of the product will be decisive . </S>",
    "<S> price and technological advance then play the role of a bias .    </S>",
    "<S> here we consider the case of four - person confrontations in a spatially extended system in which the actors ( species @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) move randomly . </S>",
    "<S> the process of spatial contamination of opinion plays a crucial role in this dynamics .    in the original galam model  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the density threshold for an invading emergence of @xmath1 is @xmath7 if the @xmath1 group has a qualitative bias over @xmath0 . with a spatial distribution of the species , even if @xmath9 , @xmath1 can still win over @xmath0 provided that it strives for confrontation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore a qualitative advantage is found not to be enough to win . a geographic as well a definite degree of aggressiveness are instrumental to overcome the less fitted majority .    </S>",
    "<S> the model we use to describe the two populations @xmath0 and @xmath1 influencing each other or competing for some unique resources , is based on the reaction - diffusion automata proposed by chopard and droz  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , here , we consider only one type of particle with two possible internal states ( @xmath10 ) , coding for the @xmath0 or @xmath1 species , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the individuals move on a two - dimensional square lattice . at each site , there are always four individuals ( any combination of @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s is possible ) . </S>",
    "<S> these four individuals all travel in a different lattice direction ( north , east , south and west ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the interaction takes place in the form of `` fights '' between the four individuals meeting on the same site . at each fight , </S>",
    "<S> the group nature ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) is updated according to the majority rule , when possible , otherwise with a bias in favor of the best fitted group :    * the local majority species ( if any ) wins : @xmath11 where @xmath12 . * when there is an equal number of @xmath0 and @xmath1 on a site , @xmath1 wins the confrontation with probability @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath14 $ ] is the bias accounting for some advantage ( or extra fitness ) of species @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the above rule is applied with probability @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , with probability @xmath16 the group composition does not change because no fight occurs .    between fights </S>",
    "<S> both population agents perform a random walk on the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by shuffling randomly the directions of motion of the fours individuals present at each site and letting them move to the corresponding neighboring sites  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> initially , populations @xmath0 and @xmath1 are randomly distributed over the lattice , with respective concentrations @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the model richness comes from the even confrontations . </S>",
    "<S> if only odd fights would happen , the initial majority population would always win after some short time . </S>",
    "<S> the key parameters of this model are ( i ) @xmath15 , the aggressiveness ( probability of confrontation ) , ( ii ) @xmath17 , the @xmath1 s bias of winning a tie and ( iii ) @xmath4 , the initial density of @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the strategy according to which a minority of @xmath1 s ( with yet a technical , genetic , persuasive advantage ) can win against a large population of @xmath0 s is not obvious . </S>",
    "<S> should they fight very often , try to spread or accept a peace agreement ? </S>",
    "<S> we study the parameter space by running cellular automata implementing the above system .    in the limit of low aggressiveness ( @xmath18 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the particles move a long time before fighting . due to the diffusive motion , </S>",
    "<S> correlations between successive fights are destroyed and @xmath1 wins provided that @xmath19 and @xmath20 this is the mean - field level of our dynamical model which corresponds to the theoretical calculations made by galam in his election model  @xcite .    more generally , and for @xmath21 , we observe that @xmath1 can win even when @xmath22 , provided it acts aggressively , i.e. by having a large enough @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there is a critical density @xmath23 such that , when @xmath24 , all @xmath0 are eliminated in the final outcome . below @xmath25 , @xmath1 looses unless some specific spatial configurations of @xmath1 s are present .    </S>",
    "<S> this is a general and important feature of our model : the growth of species @xmath1 at the expense of @xmath0 is obtained by a spatial organization . </S>",
    "<S> small clusters that may accidentally form act as nucleus from which the @xmath1 s can develop . in other words , above the mean - field threshold @xmath7 there is no need to organize in order to win but , below this value only condensed regions will be able to grow . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath15 is too small , such an organization is not possible ( it is destroyed by diffusion ) and the strength advantage of @xmath1 does not lead to success .    figure  [ pbvsk0 ] summarizes , as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath15 , the regions where either @xmath0 or @xmath1 succeeds . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the separation curve satisfies the equation @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting to study the time needed to annihilate completely the looser . here </S>",
    "<S> , time is measured as the number of fights per site ( i.e. @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the iteration time of the automaton ) . </S>",
    "<S> we observed that , in this case , the dynamics is quite fast and a few units of time are sufficient to yield a collective change of opinion .    </S>",
    "<S> the previous results assume a contant bias . </S>",
    "<S> however , with the assumption that an individual surrounded by several of its congeners becomes more confident and thus less efficient in its fight , one may vary the bias @xmath17 as a function of the local density of @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> for example , within a neighborhood of size @xmath29 , the bias can decrease from 1 to 0 as follows : @xmath30 if @xmath31 ( local minority of @xmath1 s ) and @xmath32 if @xmath33 ( local majority of @xmath1 s ) , where @xmath34 designates the number of @xmath1 s in the neighborhood .    </S>",
    "<S> this rule produces an interesting and non - intuitive new behavior . depending on the value of @xmath35 , </S>",
    "<S> there is a region near @xmath36 such that the @xmath0 species can win by preventing the @xmath1 s from spreading in the environment . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by a very aggressive attitude of the @xmath0 s . </S>",
    "<S> note that this effect is already present in the previous case ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) , but only on the line @xmath36 and for @xmath39 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ pbvsk3 ] summarizes the regions where either @xmath0 or @xmath1 succeeds when @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the separation line shown in light gray , the time needed to decimate the other opinion is indicated by the gray levels . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that this time may become large in the vicinity of the critical line . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the time scale associated with the process , such a slow evolution may be interpreted as a coexistence of the two species ( if a campaign lasts only a few days or a few weeks , the conflict will not be resolved within this period of time ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the correlations that may exist between successive fights may strongly affect the global behavior of the system and that an organization is the key feature to obtain a definite advantage over the other population . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is important . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , during a campaign against smoking or an attempt to impose a new system , it is much more efficient ( and cheaper ) to target the effort on small nuclei of persons rather than sending the information in an uncorrelated manner .    </S>",
    "<S> also , according to figure  [ pbvsk3 ] , an hypothetical minority of smokers in france must harass non - smokers during social meetings ( coffee break , lunch , ... ) rather often but not systematically , in order to reinforce their position . on the contrary , for an hypothetical majority of smokers in the us , either a smooth or a stiff harassment against the non - smokers </S>",
    "<S> is required to survive .    </S>",
    "<S> aggressiveness is the key to preserve the spatial organization . </S>",
    "<S> refusing a fight is an effective way for the @xmath0 species to use its numerical superiority by allowing the @xmath1 individuals to spread . with this respect </S>",
    "<S> , a minority should not accept a peace agreement ( which would results in a lower @xmath15 ) with the leading majority unless the strength equilibrium is modified ( i.e. @xmath1 is better represented ) .    </S>",
    "<S> motion is also a crucial ingredient in the spreading process . </S>",
    "<S> there is a subtle tradeoff between moving and fighting . </S>",
    "<S> when little motion is allowed between fights ( @xmath41 ) , the advantage is in favor of @xmath0 again . in an epidemic system , our model shows that two solutions are possible to avoid infestation : either one let the virus die of isolation ( dilute state due to a small @xmath15 ) or one decimates it before it spreads ( large @xmath15 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally a simple variant of the above model provides a possible scenario to explain punctuated equilibria  @xcite in the evolution of living organisms . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the transition between two forms of life may be quite abrupt . </S>",
    "<S> there is no trace of the intermediate evolutionary steps . to give some insights into this problem we modify our voter model by including a creation rate for the @xmath1 individuals ( @xmath42 , with probability @xmath43 ) . in this context , the @xmath1 species is fitter than the @xmath0 species ( the bias @xmath44 ) but the numerical advantage of @xmath0 is too strong for @xmath1 to survive . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the simulation is run for a long enough time , nucleation in this metastable state will happen , which will produce locally a very favorable spatial arrangement of @xmath1 s . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath1 s will then develop and , very rapidly , eliminate all @xmath0 s . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , a very numerous species may live for a considerable amount of time without endangering competitors and suddenly , be decimated by a latent , fitter species . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario needs a strong statistical fluctuation but no additional external , global event .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> although the model we propose is very simple , it abstracts the complicated behavior of real life agents by capturing some essential ingredients . for this reason </S>",
    "<S> , the results we have presented may shed light on the generic mechanisms observed in a social system of opinion making . </S>"
