    "gaussian states , _ i.e. _ states with gaussian wigner functions , are the key ingredient of many continuous variable ( cv ) quantum information protocols.@xcite however , in order to achieve some relevant tasks , non - gaussianity ( nong ) in the form of non - gaussian states ( states endowed with a non - gaussian wigner function ) or non - gaussian operations is either required or desirable .",
    "for instance , it has been recently demonstrated that nong can be used to improve teleportation , cloning and storage ; in addition non - gaussian operations are interesting for the realization of entanglement distillation and noiseless amplification.@xcite    several implementations of non - gaussian states have been reported so far , in particular from squeezed light,@xcite close - to - threshold parametric oscillators@xcite and in superconducting circuits.@xcite such states have been mainly achieved in the low energy regime@xcite by using single - photon detectors , visible light photon counters@xcite and time - multiplexed photo - resolving detectors.@xcite more recently , we extended the investigation to the mesoscopic regime by exploiting the linear response of hybrid photodetectors@xcite and si - photomultipliers.@xcite    being it recognized as a resource for cv quantum information , the need of quantifying the non - gaussian character of states and operations naturally arises and different non - gaussianity measures have been proposed.@xcite indeed , not all of them are characterized by an operational meaning .",
    "moreover , in the realistic situations , non - gaussianity measures based only on quantities that can be experimentally accessed are desirable . to this aim , here we present an experimental work in which we compare the two measures introduced in refs .",
    "[ 18 ] and  [ 19 ] by testing them on phase - randomized coherent states or phase - averaged coherent states ( phavs ) , a class of states exploited in communication channels and in decoy - state - based quantum key distribution protocols.@xcite the two measures , being in perfect agreement with each other , can be considered a useful tool to quantify the non - gaussian nature exhibited by the wigner functions and testified by the experimental results . moreover , the sensitivity of such non - gaussian measures to small changes in the mean number of photons suggests their possible exploitation to test decoy states based on the class of phavs .",
    "a single - mode phav @xmath0 is a classical state obtainable by randomizing the phase @xmath1 of a coherent state @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "it is characterized by a density matrix diagonal in the photon - number basis and by a poissonian photon statistics .",
    "the state is obviously phase - insensitive and its wigner function reads:@xcite @xmath4\\ , , \\label{eq : wignerphav}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the modified bessel function .",
    "this function , being it endowed with a dip in the origin of the phase space , is clearly non - gaussian .",
    "another state exhibiting a nong nature , which can be useful for application to passive decoy state quantum key distribution,@xcite can be obtained from the interference of two phavs @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( 2-phav hereafter ) at a beam splitter ( bs ) with transmissivity @xmath8 .",
    "the states outgoing the bs are still diagonal in the photon number basis and the transmitted one is characterized by the following wigner function : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and the function in the integral is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : wignerphav ] ) .",
    "obviously , the wigner function of the reflected mode can be obtained by replacing @xmath8 with the reflectivity @xmath11 . in both cases ,",
    "the quantification of nong amount can be achieved by considering two competitive measures recently introduced .",
    "one of them is based on the hilbert - schmidt distance from a gaussian reference state , namely : @xmath12",
    "= \\frac{d^2_{\\rm hs}[\\varrho_{\\beta } , \\sigma]}{\\mu[\\varrho_{\\beta}]}=\\frac{\\mu[\\varrho_{\\beta}]+\\mu[\\sigma]+2\\kappa[\\varrho_{\\beta } , \\sigma]}{2\\mu[\\varrho_{\\beta}]},\\ ] ] where @xmath13 $ ] is the purity of the state @xmath14 , @xmath15 is a reference gaussian state with the same covariance matrix as the state @xmath6 under investigation and @xmath16=$]tr@xmath17 $ ] denotes the overlap between @xmath6 and @xmath15.@xcite    the second measure we address is given by : @xmath18 = s(\\sigma ) - s(\\varrho_{\\beta}),\\ ] ] where @xmath19 $ ] is the von neumann entropy of the state @xmath14.@xcite as both phav and 2-phav are diagonal in the photon - number basis , their reference state is a thermal equilibrium state , with the same mean number of photons @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , the two measures result based only on quantities that can be experimentally accessed by direct detection , since both eqs .",
    "( [ nonga ] ) and  ( [ nongb ] ) can be expressed in terms of photon - number distributions.@xcite in particular , eq .",

    "we generated the class of phavs by exploiting the second harmonics ( @ 523 nm , 5-ps pulses ) of a mode - locked nd : ylf laser amplified at 500 hz ( high - q laser production ) .    : variable neutral density filter ; bs : 50/50 beam splitter ; pz : piezoelectric movement ; mf : multimode fiber ( 600  @xmath31 m core).,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    according to the experimental setup sketched in fig .",
    "[ setup ] , we obtained the single phav by sending the light pulses to a mirror mounted on a piezo - electric movement .",
    "its displacement , which was controlled by a function generator , was operated at a frequency of 100  hz and covered a 12  @xmath31 m span .",
    "moreover , we produced the 2-phav from the interference of two single phavs at a bs .",
    "a continuous variable density filter f@xmath32 allowed us to change the total energy of the states , whereas a second filter f@xmath33 , inserted in the path of one of the two phavs , was used to change the balancing between the two components of the 2-phav .",
    "as the states to be characterized can be fully described by their photon - number distributions , we implemented a direct detection scheme involving a photon - counting detector , @xmath34 a hybrid photodetector ( hpd , r10467u-40 , maximum quantum efficiency @xmath350.5 at 500 nm , hamamatsu ) .",
    "this detector is characterized not only by a partial photon - counting capability , but also by a linear response up to 100 photons . thanks to its properties",
    ", the hpd can actually operate in the mesoscopic domain , where the states are robust with respect to losses .",
    "the output of the detector was amplified ( preamplifier a250 plus amplifier a275 , amptek ) , synchronously integrated ( sgi , sr250 , stanford ) and digitized ( at - mio-16e-1 , national instruments ) .",
    "the gain of the detection apparatus was obtained in a self - consistent way without any @xmath36 @xmath37 calibration.@xcite this method allows us to reconstruct the detected photons distributions of the states , which represent the basic element to retrieve their wigner function .",
    "such a goal can be achieved by mixing at a bs the state to be characterized with a coherent probe field whose amplitude and phase are continuously varied.@xcite in this case , as both the states are phase - insensitive , we actually reconstruct only a section of their wigner distribution for fixed phase .     and @xmath38 and of a 2-phav ( right panel ) , with @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",

    "[ wig - comp ] we plot the experimental data ( blue dots ) of a single phav ( left panel ) and of a balanced 2-phav ( right panel ) , endowed with nearly the same mean number of detected photons , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively . in each panel",
    "we also show the 3d - theoretical expectations ( mesh ) for the phav and 2-phav , respectively:@xcite @xmath45 @xmath46 being the overall ( spatial and temporal ) overlap between the probe and the phav , and : @xmath47 } , \\label{eq : wigner2phavoverlap}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 describes the overall overlap between the probe and the 2-phav and @xmath49 the overall overlap between the two components of the 2-phav . in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : wignerphavoverlap ] ) and ( [ eq : wigner2phavoverlap ] ) , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are now the mean numbers of photons we measured ( see fig .",
    "[ wig - comp ] ) , thus including the quantum efficiency .",
    "in fact , it is worth noting that for classical states the functional form of the wigner function is preserved also in the presence of losses and its expression , given in terms of detected photons , reads @xmath52 , where @xmath53 represent the detected - photon distributions of the state to be measured displaced by the probe field.@xcite as testified by the very high values of the overlaps @xmath46 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 reported in the caption of fig .",
    "[ wig - comp ] , we actually achieved a very good superposition in aligning the system . from a direct comparison between the two panels",
    "it emerges that the states under investigation are non - gaussian .",
    "in fact , the wigner function of a single phav is characterized by a dip in the origin of the phase space , whereas that of a 2-phav with almost the same mean value exhibits a peak in the origin followed by a `` shoulder '' .",
    "moreover , it is worth noting that the measurements were actually performed in the mesoscopic photon - number domain , as the reconstruction of the wigner functions was achieved by displacing either the phav or the 2-phav with a coherent field whose intensity was changed from zero up to four times the mean value of the states themselves .    to quantify the nong amount , we considered the measures introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] . as from the experimental point of view",
    "we do not have access to photons , we calculated similar expressions , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , for detected photons , which represent lower bounds to nong.@xcite in particular we found @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the single phav , whereas we obtained @xmath58 and @xmath59 for the 2-phav .",
    "the consistency between the two measures , together with the fact that measure @xmath54 can be directly expressed in terms of wigner functions@xcite , demonstrate that a wigner function exhibiting a dip in the origin of the phase space is more non - gaussian than one characterized by a peak in the origin followed by a `` shoulder '' .",
    "moreover , the results prove that combining two non - gaussian states does not necessarily lead to an increase of the overall nong .     and @xmath55 as functions of the mean number of detected photons of almost balanced 2-phavs ( @xmath60 ) .",

    "[ nongunbal ] we show @xmath54 and @xmath55 as functions of the mean total energy of the 2-phav for a fixed choice of the balancing , namely 1.24 : we can notice that the values of both the measures increase at increasing the mean number of detected photons .",
    "moreover , in the upper right panel of the same figure we plot the lower bounds of the nong measures as functions of the ratio between the two components at fixed mean number of detected photons , that is @xmath64 . as one may expect",
    ", it monotonically decreases at increasing the balancing .",
    "in fact , the most unbalanced condition reduces to the case in which there is only a single phav , whereas the most balanced one corresponds to have a balanced 2-phav .    for the sake of completeness ,",
    "in the lower panel of the same figure we show the results we obtained for the single phav as a function of the mean value .",
    "also in this case the experimental data , which are superimposed to the theoretical expectations , testify the accordance between the two measures since they increase their value at increasing the energy of the state .    as in all the cases presented in fig .",
    "[ nongunbal ] the behavior of the two measures is very similar except for the absolute values , we decided to test their monotonicity by following the suggestion of ref .",
    "[ 17 ] . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ comparison ] , we plot the experimental values of measure b as a function of those of measure a for the three cases presented in fig .",
    "[ nongunbal ] .",
    "it is evident that the two measures are monotone to each other , even if the absolute values are different .",
    "in particular , measure b is endowed with higher values , thus resulting more sensitive to small differences in the choice of the parameters .",
    "this property , together with the fact that @xmath55 is characterized by smaller error bars with respect to the other one , can be considered a good criterion to choose one measure instead of the other to quantify the nong amount and thus discriminate the states under investigation for possible applications . nevertheless , it is interesting to notice that the behavior of one amount with respect to the other is not described by a unique curve .",
    "in fact , in the case of the 2-phav at fixed ratio and variable total energy ( blue dots ) the curve is slightly different from those corresponding to the other two cases , namely the 2-phav at fixed total energy and variable ratio ( red dots ) or the single phav with variable energy ( black dots ) . in order to prove that this difference does not depend on the reliability of the experimental data , in the right panel of fig .",

    "it is evident that there is not a unique curve , as already testified by the experimental data .",
    "nevertheless , we want to notice that there are some limits in which the curves are superimposed ( this happens either when the 2-phav is almost unbalanced or when it is very low populated as in both the cases it reduces to the case of a single phav ) or intersect each other ( such as in the case in which the 2-phav is characterized by a precise choice of total energy and ratio ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented an experimental investigation of the non - gaussian nature of the class of phavs by reconstructing their wigner function and using two different measures , both based on quantities experimentally accessed by direct detection , to quantify the nong amount .",
    "we proved the consistency of the different approaches and tested the monotonicity of the two measures .",
    "nevertheless , the comparison performed on diagonal states belonging to the class of phavs for different parameters settings showed that there is not a unique curve describing the behavior of one measure with respect to the other .",
    "in addition , we discussed the choice of the best measure between the two proposed . according to data",
