    "however , the presence of possibly three scalar states in close proximity , @xmath507 and @xmath508 , and in the vicinity of the lattice scalar glueball , suggests that mixing involving both @xmath16 and @xmath26 will be essential .",
    "we shall now consider this situation .",
    "if the @xmath2 nonet , @xmath509 is in the vicinty of a glueball , @xmath15 , the above analysis requires generalisation .",

    "we now consider specific examples of mixing in the @xmath529 system .",
    "an interesting possibility is that three @xmath160 s in the @xmath530 gev region are admixtures of the three isosinglet states @xmath26 , @xmath531 , and @xmath532@xcite .",
    "recently there have been two specific schemes proposed which are based on lattice qcd and the emergent phenomenology of scalar mesons . in this section",

    "such a magnitude implies significant mixing in eq.([mixing ] ) and is better generalised to a @xmath541 mixing matrix . mixing based on lattice glueball masses lead to two classes of solution of immediate interest :    ( i)@xmath542 , corresponding to @xmath543 in the midst of the nonet@xcite    ( ii)@xmath544 , corresponding to @xmath543 above the @xmath2 members of the nonet@xcite .",
    "we shall denote the three mass eigenstates by @xmath545 with @xmath546 , @xmath547 and @xmath548 , and the three isosinglet states @xmath549 with @xmath550 , @xmath551 and @xmath552 so that @xmath553 .",
    "recent data on the decay @xmath554@xcite may be interpreted within the scheme of ref@xcite as being consistent with the parameter @xmath555 .",
    "this enables simple analysis ; if for illustration we adopt @xmath556 , the resulting mixing amplitudes are ( scheme `` @xmath75 '' ) : @xmath557 by contrast , weingarten@xcite has considered the case where the bare glueball lies above the @xmath21 member of the nonet .",
    "his mixing matrix is ( scheme `` @xmath558 '' ) : @xmath559    the solutions for the lowest state are similar , as are the relative phases and qualitative importance of the @xmath15 component in the high mass state . both solutions exhibit destructive interference between the @xmath384 and @xmath21 flavours for the middle state .    if we make the simplifying assumption that the photons couple to the @xmath384 and @xmath21 in direct proportion to the respective @xmath560 ( i.e. we ignore mass effects and any differences between the @xmath384 and @xmath21 wavefunctions ) , then the corresponding two photon widths can be written in terms of these mixing coefficients : @xmath561 where @xmath562 is the @xmath461 width for a @xmath161 system with @xmath563 .",
    "one can use eq .",
    "( [ mixings ] ) to evaluate the relative strength of the two photon widths for the three @xmath160 states with the input of the mixing coefficients .",
    "these are ( ignoring mass dependent effects ) @xmath564 in scheme @xmath75 , to be compared with @xmath565 in scheme @xmath558 . at present",
    "the only measured @xmath1 width in this list is that of the @xmath566 kev@xcite . using this to normalise the above",
    ", we anticipate @xmath567 kev ( scheme @xmath75 ) or @xmath568 kev ( scheme @xmath558 ) .",
    "both schemes imply @xmath569 kev .",
    "this relative ordering of @xmath1 widths is a common feature of mixings for all initial configurations for which the bare glueball does not lie nearly degenerate to the @xmath384 state . as such",
    ", it is a robust test of the general idea of @xmath384 and @xmath21 mixing with a lattice motivated glueball .",
    "if , say , the @xmath570 width of the @xmath54 were to be smaller than the @xmath9 , or comparable to or greater than the @xmath519 , then the general hypothesis of significant three state mixing with a lattice glueball would be disproven .",
    "the corollary is that qualitative agreement may be used to begin isolating in detail the mixing pattern .",
    "now we turn to @xmath31 radiative decay rates .",
    "since in either scheme @xmath571 the discussion of the previous section implies , @xmath572 however each scheme makes a more specific prediction . by our hypothesis",
    "that @xmath2 coupling to @xmath26 is suppressed at @xmath539 relative to the corresponding glueball amplitude , we may scale the @xmath573 production amplitudes for the mixed states as follows . for simplicity we shall assume that @xmath574 , where @xmath136 is some constant whose magnitude and phase are in general model dependent . in this approximation , we have for scheme @xmath75 @xmath575 in general we see that for mixing scheme @xmath75 :    ( i)the absence of a dominant signal in @xmath576 suggests that @xmath136 is not negative and that the @xmath15-@xmath2 interference there is destructive .",
    "( ii)the @xmath2 admixture in the @xmath9 is nearly pure flavour octet and hence decouples from @xmath26 .",
    "this leaves the strength of @xmath320 at about @xmath577 of the pure glueball strength , which is consistent with the mean of the two analyses in section [ ss : f1500 ] .",
    "( iii)the destructive interference in the @xmath519 case implies a constructive effect for the @xmath54 and hence this picture predicts that @xmath578 . if as a particular example for comparison between the two schemes we take @xmath579 to decouple @xmath519 entirely in radiative @xmath31 decay , we find @xmath580 .",
    "mixing scheme @xmath558 , corresponding to an ideal glueball lying above the nonet , leads to the following amplitudes : @xmath581 here both @xmath519 and @xmath9 production are suppressed due to the destructive interference of the glueball and @xmath2 components ; the @xmath54 being enhanced as in the previous example . for the example",
    "@xmath582 , ( chosen to decouple the @xmath519 and enable comparison with scheme @xmath75 as above ) we find @xmath583 .",
    "thus , in conclusion , both these mixing schemes imply a similar hierachy of strengths in @xmath1 production which may be used as a test of the general idea of three state mixing between glueball and a nearby nonet .",
    "prominent production of @xmath584 is also a common feature .",
    "when the experimental situation clarifies on the @xmath573 branching fractions , we can use the relative strengths to distinguish between the case where the glueball lies within a nonet , ref@xcite , or above the @xmath21 member , ref@xcite .",
    "we have clarified the relationship between @xmath51 and @xmath50 proposed by cakir and farrar@xcite . in particular , we have examined its dependence on the @xmath585 form factors and discussed theoretical and experimental constraints on these form factors . we conclude that the relation can be used , possibly with generalized @xmath48 functions , for light-@xmath185 mesons and glueballs as well as heavy @xmath185 mesons . using this relation , we find    * the @xmath9 is at least half - glueball if the bugg et al analysis@xcite of the @xmath342 channel is confirmed , but is less so according to the bes results .",
    "analysis of markiii data on @xmath586 is urgently needed . at this moment",
    "the experimental determinations of @xmath587 are inconsistent . *",
    "the @xmath10 is also at least half - glueball , if @xmath11 ; if @xmath17 it is a @xmath185 meson .",
    "experimental determinations of the @xmath588 spectra in the @xmath589 gev region are presently inconsistent . *",
    "the @xmath590 is unlikely to have @xmath11 , if present experimental data are correct .",
    "if it has @xmath17 it strongly resembles a glueball . *",
    "the @xmath14 is separated into two states .",
    "the lower mass state , @xmath438 , has strong affinity for glue ; the higher mass @xmath439 is consistent with being the @xmath21 member of a nonet , perhaps mixed with glue .",
    "it is of urgent importance to ( a ) arrive at an experimental consensus on the @xmath160 and @xmath53 masses and widths in the 1600 - 1800 region and ( b ) resolve the discrepancies in the present determinations of @xmath591 .",
    "measurement of production branching fractions of the @xmath160 and @xmath53 mesons in @xmath200 radiative decay should be quite easy and yield useful additional information .",
    "we also outlined a procedure to use data on @xmath592 and @xmath66 together , to help unravel the @xmath16 and @xmath26 composition of mesons . to accomplish this",
    ", measurement of @xmath593 is an essential ingredient .",
    "an emerging mystery is the @xmath14 region .",
    "its properties seem to differ in @xmath31 radiative decay and @xmath30 annihilation , and it has not been seen in central production .",
    "possibly these differences are due to the different interplay of gluon and @xmath2 annihilation in the various production processes .",
    "this merits further investigation , both experimental and theoretical .",
    "the strong production of the @xmath22 in radiative @xmath31 decay indicate that it could be a glueball .",
    "however its low mass is difficult to reconcile with lattice gauge predictions .",
    "its properties and mass are consistent with those expected for a bound state of light gluinos . given that the @xmath22 may be evidence of a new degree of freedom in qcd , or evidence of dynamics beyond quenched lattice gauge theory in the @xmath8 sector , more detailed experimental investigation of the pseudoscalar sector is a high priority .",
