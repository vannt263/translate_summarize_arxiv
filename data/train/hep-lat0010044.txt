    "two kinds of topological defects were proposed by t  hooft as possible configurations condensing in the disordered phase of @xmath1 yang - mills theories to produce confinement : @xmath2 vortices  @xcite and monopoles  @xcite .",
    "monopoles have the natural topology to three dimensional space , corresponding to a mapping : @xmath3 .",
    "their condensation implies dual superconductivity of the vacuum , and gives an appealing physical picture of confinement in terms of dual abrikosov tubes produced by dual meissner effect  @xcite .",
    "indeed , condensation of magnetic charge has been unambiguously demonstrated by numerical simulations on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "an operator @xmath4 carrying non - zero magnetic charge is constructed , and its vev @xmath5 is measured in the confined and deconfined phases , as a candidate disorder parameter .",
    "the extrapolation to the thermodynamical limit is done by finite size scaling techniques and the result is : @xmath6 both @xmath7 and the critical index of the correlation length @xmath8 are obtained , and they agree with determinations by other techniques  @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath9 are : @xmath10 @xmath11 signals dual superconductivity .",
    "the same disorder parameter can be defined in full @xmath12 , and shows a similar behaviour at the deconfinement phase transition  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon seems to be independent of the abelian projection chosen to define the monopoles .",
    "the meaning of these results is that the ( yet unknown ) excitations , which condense in the confined phase and are weakly interacting in the dual picture , must be magnetically charged with respect to all abelian projections .",
    "attempts to identify these excitations with the monopoles of the maximal abelian projection do not seem to work as expected  @xcite .    in order to understand better the properties of the dual excitations , we investigate by similar techniques the role of vortices  @xcite . in 3 + 1",
    "dimension vortices are string - like topological defects , associated to closed curves @xmath13 .",
    "the operator @xmath14 which creates such a vortex obeys the following algebraic relation with the wilson loop @xmath15 , defined as the parallel transport along the curve @xmath16 : @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the linking number of the curves @xmath13 and @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "[ eq : commut ] that whenever @xmath19 obeys the area law , @xmath20 obeys the perimeter law and viceversa  @xcite .",
    "a consequence of the area law for @xmath21 is that the polyakov line , defined as the parallel transport along a line in the time direction closed by periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , has to vanish .",
    "instead , it can be that @xmath22 when the wilson loop obeys the perimeter law .",
    "we argue that the same happens for the dual loops @xmath14 .",
    "we define a disorder parameter @xmath23 as the `` dual polyakov line '' , corresponding to the operator @xmath14 for a curve @xmath13 going through the lattice , e.g. parallel to the @xmath24 axis , at fixed time and closed by pbc . in the phase where @xmath25 obeys the area law ( and",
    "therefore @xmath19 obeys a perimeter law ) , @xmath26 ; whenever @xmath11 the perimeter law is possible for @xmath20 .",
    "this observation helps in defining a disorder parameter in 3 + 1 dimension .    in 2 + 1",
    "dimension the vortex is point - like , it can be described by a local field , and a conserved quantum number can be associated to it , which is broken in the disordered phase  @xcite . instead , no conserved quantum number can be associated to vortices in 3 + 1 dimension .",
    "for the sake of definiteness , let us take for the curve @xmath13 a rectangle @xmath27 in the @xmath28 plane : @xmath29 the definition given below can be extended trivially to any curve @xmath13 .",
    "we define the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the ordinary partition function for pure yang - mills theories on the lattice defined by the wilson action : @xmath32 = \\sum_{x,\\mu,\\nu } \\ , \\mathrm{re } ~\\mathrm{tr } \\left [ 1 - p_{\\mu\\nu }    \\right]\\ ] ] with @xmath33 is the usual plaquette .",
    "@xmath34 is the partition function corresponding to the action @xmath35 obtained from @xmath36 by the change : @xmath37 we study by numerical simulations , the behaviour of the `` dual polyakov line '' , which corresponds to the above definition with : @xmath38 in that case the change of variables becomes : @xmath39 for the proof that eq .",
    "[ eq : def ] really corresponds to the definition of @xmath14 as defined by eq .",
    "[ eq : commut ] and for comparison with alternative definitions in the literature , we refer to  @xcite .",
    "we shall also compute the correlator : @xmath40 as @xmath41 , @xmath42 whence @xmath23 can be extracted .    at finite @xmath43",
    "there is no propagation in time and @xmath23 is computed directly , provided @xmath44 boundary conditions are adopted  @xcite .",
    "we compute @xmath23 by the techniques explained above , or better we compute : @xmath45 which contains the same information and is less noisy  @xcite . the behaviour of @xmath46 vs @xmath47 for a @xmath48 lattice with @xmath49 and @xmath50 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : peak ] ; the corresponding @xmath46 for the creation of monopoles is plotted in the same figure for comparison . as explained in the introduction , @xmath46 is independent within errors of the abelian projection used to define the magnetic charges  @xcite .    similarly to the case of monopoles ,",
    "the behaviour of @xmath46 at large @xmath47 is proportional to @xmath51 @xmath52 implying that @xmath53 $ ] vanishes for @xmath54 as @xmath55 . at low @xmath47 , @xmath46 is bounded from below when the volume is increased , which implies @xmath11 for @xmath56 .    around @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "in the scaling region one expects : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the correlation length .",
    "this yields the scaling law : @xmath61 we shall assume @xmath62 . requiring scaling fixes @xmath63 and @xmath9 .",
    "the quality of the scaling for @xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] .",
    "the critical exponents that we obtain are : @xmath64 @xmath57 and @xmath8 are compatible with the standard determinations  @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 is equal within errors to the corresponding index for the monopole disorder parameter .",
    "preliminary data for @xmath65 present a similar behaviour  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the `` dual polyakov line '' is a good disorder parameter for confinement .",
    "this is a confirmation of the argument in ref .",
    "@xcite about the area and perimeter law .",
    "a direct check is presented in ref .",
    "a disorder parameter for confinement , related to the condensation of magnetic charges already exists  @xcite , its behaviour is independent of the abelian projection used to define the monopoles , and describes confinement both in quenched  @xcite and unquenched qcd  @xcite .",
    "this means that dual superconductivity is at work as a mechanism of confinement . assuming that there exists a dual description in terms of weakly coupled fields",
    ", they must carry magnetic charge with respect to any abelian projection .",
    "the result of the present investigation on vortices has no direct implication on the symmetry of the dual fields .",
    "it confirms , however , the argument of ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath20 obeys the area law when @xmath21 obeys the perimeter law and viceversa , which has also been tested in  @xcite .",
    "the dual polyakov line is a good disorder parameter for confinement , in the same way as the ordinary polyakov line is a good order parameter .",
    "an analogous analysis for @xmath65 is in preparation and gives similar results  @xcite .",
    "a measurment of the critical indices using a monopole operator in full @xmath12 is in progress  @xcite .",
    "we are also trying to extend to full qcd the study of the dual polyakov line .",
    "the dependence on @xmath66 of both approaches is an interesting question , and deserves numerical investigation , in order to check the basic ideas of the large-@xmath66 limit .",
