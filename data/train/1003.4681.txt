    "the ability to simulate the final inspiral , merger , and ring - down of black hole binaries with numerical relativity  @xcite plays a key role in understanding a source of gravitational waves that may one day be observed with gravitational wave detectors . while initial simulations focused on binaries of equal - mass , zero spin , and quasi - circular inspirals",
    ", there currently is a large effort to explore the parameter space of binaries , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "a key part of studying the parameter space is to simulate binaries with intermediate mass - ratios .    to date , the mass ratio furthest from equal masses that has been numerically simulated is 10:1 @xcite .",
    "these simulations use the baumgarte - shapiro - shibata - nakamura ( bssn ) formulation @xcite with 1+log slicing , and the @xmath0 driver condition for the shift @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", it was noted that the stability of the simulation is sensitive to the damping factor , @xmath1 , used in the @xmath0 driver condition , @xmath2 here , @xmath3 is the shift vector describing how the coordinates move inside the spatial slices , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the contraction of the christoffel symbol , @xmath6 , with the conformal metric , @xmath7 .    the standard choice for @xmath1 is to set it to a constant value , which works well even for the most demanding simulations as long as the mass ratio is sufficiently close to unity . in binary simulations , a typical choice is a constant value of about @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the total mass of the system .",
    "this choice , however , leads to instabilities for the mass ratio 10:1 simulation @xcite , although stability was obtained for @xmath10 .",
    "the value of @xmath1 is chosen to damp an outgoing change in the shift while still yielding stable evolutions . as we will show , if @xmath1 is too small , there are unwanted oscillations , and values that are too large lead to instabilities . by itself , this observation is not new , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the key issue for unequal masses is that , as evident from ( [ eq : gammadriver ] ) , the damping factor @xmath1 has units of inverse mass , @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the interval of suitable values for @xmath1 depends on the mass of the black holes . for unequal masses , a constant @xmath1 can",
    "not equally well accommodate both black holes .",
    "a constant damping parameter implies that the effective damping near each black hole is asymmetric since the damping parameter has dimensions @xmath11 . for large mass ratios",
    ", this asymmetry in the grid can be large enough to lead to a failure of the simulations because the damping may become too large or too small for one of the black holes . to cure this problem , we need a position - dependent damping parameter that adapts to the local mass",
    ". in particular , we want it to vary such that , in the vicinity of the @xmath12 puncture with mass @xmath13 , its value approaches @xmath14 .",
    "a position - dependent @xmath1 was already considered when the @xmath0 driver condition was introduced @xcite , but such constructions were not pursued further because for moderate mass ratios a constant @xmath1 works well .",
    "recently , we revived the idea of a non - constant @xmath1 for moving puncture evolutions in order to remove the limitations of a constant @xmath1 for large mass ratios . in @xcite , we constructed a position - dependent @xmath1 using the the conformal factor , @xmath15 , which carries information both about the location of the black holes , and about the local puncture mass .",
    "the form of @xmath1 was chosen to have proper fall - off rates both at the punctures and at large distance from the binary . in @xcite ,",
    "this approach was used successfully for mass ratio 10:1 .",
    "( we note in passing that damping is useful in other gauges as well , e.g.  in  @xcite the modified harmonic gauge condition includes position - dependent damping by use of the lapse function . )    in the present work , we examine one potential short - coming of the choice of @xcite , which leads us to suggest an alternative type of position - dependent @xmath1 . using @xcite , we find large fluctuations in the values of that @xmath1 , and this might lead to instabilities in the simulation of larger mass - ratio binary black holes . to address this ,",
    "we have tested two new explicit formulas for the damping factor designed to have predictable behavior throughout the domain of computation .",
    "we find the new formulas to produce only small changes in the waveforms that diminish with resolution , and there is a great deal of freedom in the implementation .",
    "independently of our discussion here , in @xcite the stability issues for large @xmath1 are explained , and a non - constant @xmath1 is suggested ( although not yet explored in actual simulations ) , that , in its explicit coordinate dependence , is similar to one of our suggestions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first describe the reasons for the damping factor and some of the reasons for limiting its value in sec  [ sec : motivation ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : forms_of_eta ] , we discuss some previous forms of @xmath1 that have been used .",
    "we also present two new definitions and why we investigated them . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we find that these new definitions agree well with the use of constant @xmath1 in the extracted gravitational waves for mass ratios up to 4:1 . finally , in sec .  [",
    "sec : discussion ] , we discuss further implications of this work .",
    "in order to define a position - dependent form for @xmath1 , it is important to determine what this damping parameter accomplishes in numerical simulations . for this reason , we examine the effects of running different simulations while varying @xmath1 between runs .",
    "first we use evolutions of single non - spinning black - holes to identify the key physical changes .",
    "then we examine equal - mass binaries to determine specific values desired in @xmath1 at both large and small radial coordinates .",
    "for all the work in this paper , we have used the bam computer code described in @xcite .",
    "it uses the bssn formalism with 1+log slicing and @xmath0 driver condition in the moving puncture framework @xcite .",

    "the merger takes place at approximately @xmath62 . in the @xmath63 case ( black , solid curve ) , the shift vector is not damped and therefore , a pulse travels outwards and distorts the shift over the whole grid .",
    "the amplitude of this pulse is considerably damped when using a non - vanishing @xmath1 and therefore the distortions are reduced .",
    "for @xmath59 ( red , dashed curve ) , there are still small bumps traveling out which are reduced by using @xmath64 ( green , dotted - dashed curve ) . ]    in this series , using a courant factor of 0.5 , we only obtained stable evolutions for @xmath65 which agrees with the limits found in section  [ sec : single_hole ] .",
    "if we chose the value of @xmath1 too large , the same kind of instability in the shift vector we found there develops in the equal mass case and the simulations fail .",
    "the failure occurs relatively early , before @xmath66 of evolution time , whereas the stable runs lasted about @xmath67 , including merger and ringdown ( we stopped the runs after ringdown ) .",
    "in section  [ sec : single_hole ] , we saw that a sufficient level of damping is needed to limit gauge dynamics , and too much damping can lead to numerical instabilities . in section",
    "[ sec : embinary ] , we saw the positive effect that sufficient damping has on the resultant waveform for equal mass binaries .",
    "while we still need damping in the gamma driver in the unequal mass case , a constant value may not fulfill the requirements of limiting gauge dynamics and permitting stable evolutions .",
    "rather , we need a definition for the damping that adjusts the value to the local mass - scale",
    ".    we will examine definitions , that naturally track the position , and mass of the individual black holes .",
    "the choice of @xmath1 should provide a reasonable value both near the individual black holes , and at large distance from the binary .",
    "we will start by examining some previous work , that has used non - constant forms of the damping parameter , and why it may be necessary to use other formulas .",
    "we will then present the two new formulas for @xmath1 , which we designed for this work .",
    "a position dependent damping was introduced some years ago by the authors of @xcite , and was later used in @xcite .",
    "that formula reads @xmath68 with @xmath69 , @xmath70 being constants , and assuming @xmath71 ( @xmath72 is the distance to the @xmath12 puncture ) .",
    "this formula was used to damp gauge dynamics while using excision for equal - mass head - on collisions .",
    "it has since been found that using the moving puncture framework allows for constant damping in the approximately equal mass case .",
    "we are looking for a formula which is suitable for the quasicircular inspiral of intermediate mass - ratio binaries .",
    "previously  @xcite , we used the formula @xmath73    , along the @xmath31-axis using eq .",
    "( [ eq : etapsimm ] ) .",
    "the simulated configuration is an equal mass binary with initial separation @xmath50 and orbits lying in the @xmath74-plane . shown",
    "are four different times during the simulation . ]    for determining a position dependent damping coefficient instead of using a constant @xmath1 . with @xmath75 taken to be a unitless constant",
    ", it can be seen that eq .",
    "( [ eq : etapsimm ] ) has units of inverse mass .",
    "the dependence on the bssn variable , @xmath15 , naturally tracks the position , and mass of the black holes .",
    "the application of eq .",
    "( [ eq : etapsimm ] ) gave good values for the damping both at the punctures , and at the outer boundary , and was even found to somewhat decrease the grid - size of the larger black hole .",
    "the latter point could have positive effects on how the individual black holes are resolved on the numerical grid .",
    "it even had the additional effect of keeping the horizon shapes roughly circular , even close to merger - something that does nt hold in the constant @xmath1 case .",
    "most importantly , the simulations remained stable , without significantly changing the gravitational waves .",
    "the formula was later used successfully for the 10:1 mass - ratio in @xcite .    despite all this , eq .",
    "( [ eq : etapsimm ] ) provides reason for concern .",
    "[ fig : oldeta_waves ] shows the form of @xmath1 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : etapsimm ] ) for a non - spinning binary of equal mass in quasicircular orbits starting at a separation of @xmath50 at four different times in the simulation .",
    "as can be seen , noise travels out from the origin as time progresses .",
    "this leaves steady features on the form of @xmath1 which could spike to higher and lower values than the range determined in sec .",
    "[ sec : single_hole ] .",
    "additionally , these sharp features may lead to unpredictable coordinate drifts , and could , in some cases , affect the long - term stability of the simulation .",
    "to illuminate the origin of the disturbances in @xmath76 , we looked at the development of @xmath76 in simulations of a single , non - spinning puncture , and a single , spinning puncture ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the result for the spinning case is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : kbh_eta ] at two different times over the @xmath31-axis .",
    "again , we see a pulse traveling outwards . only this time",
    ", it does not leave much noise on the grid .",
    "the fact that this pulse travels at a speed which is roughly @xmath78 ( in our geometric units where @xmath79 ) in both the spinning and non - spinning scenario indicates that it is related to the gauge modes traveling at speed @xmath80 in the asymptotic region where @xmath81 ( see @xcite and @xcite for a discussion of gauge speeds ) .",
    "in contrast to gauge pulses in the lapse , @xmath82 , or shift vector , @xmath3 , the pulse in @xmath83 is amplified as it walks out .",
    "we found the same result in the single puncture simulation without spin .",
    "we believe the reason for this behavior is that as the distance to the puncture increases , the conformal factor , @xmath15 , gets closer to unity .",
    "therefore , the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : etapsimm ] ) approaches zero , and the gauge disturbances in the derivatives of @xmath15 are magnified .",
    "we further observed reflections at the refinement boundaries as this pulse passes through them .",
    "this may explain the fluctuations in @xmath83 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oldeta_waves ] .",
    "while one could continue to fine - tune a formula dependent on the conformal factor to deal with these problems , we looked in a different direction to determine the form of the damping parameter .     for a single spinning puncture sitting at @xmath84 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : etapsimm ] ) after simulation time @xmath85 ( solid black line ) and @xmath86(dashed red line ) over @xmath87direction . ]      since we always know the location of a puncture , and we know what its associated mass , we chose a form of damping that uses this local information throughout the domain . to address the demands and concerns discussed in section  [ sec : motivation ] and [ sec : prev ] , we designed two position - dependent forms of @xmath1 .",
    "the two forms we tested are @xmath88 and @xmath89 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : etas6 ] ) and ( [ eq : etas5 ] ) , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are required to be positive , unitless parameters which can be chosen to change the width of the functions .",
    "the power @xmath92 is taken to be a positive integer which determines the fall - off rate .",
    "the constants @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 are then chosen to provide the desired values of @xmath1 at the punctures , and at at infinity .",
    "lastly , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are defined as @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is either one or two , and @xmath100 is the position of the @xmath99th black hole .",
    "the definition of @xmath101 is chosen to naturally scale the fall - off to the separation of the black holes .",
    "@xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 can be chosen to change the overall fall - off .",
    "our work focuses on the choice @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "following @xcite , we construct the damping factor to have units of inverse mass .",
    "we choose @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is defined as the sum of the irreducible masses .",
    "we then take @xmath106 .",
    "it is then evident that both eqs .",
    "( [ eq : etas6 ] ) and ( [ eq : etas5 ] ) will give a constant value of @xmath107 in the equal mass case .",
    "we designed the two formulas for @xmath1 in order to test the value of using fundamentally different functions . in our simulations , we found little noticeable difference in the application of one compared to the other . in the absence of such a difference , it becomes more beneficial to use eq .",
    "( [ eq : etas6 ] ) , as gaussians are computationally more expensive .",
    "it should be pointed out that eq .",
    "( [ eq : etas6 ] ) is very similar to eq .",
    "( 13 ) suggested in @xcite , and we believe the following results are very similar to what would be found using that form for the damping . going into the present work , we have no ansatz which might suggest these forms of damping yield wave forms which are any better than the use of any previous form of @xmath1 .",
    "however , as will be seen in the results sections , the waveforms we get from unequal mass binaries show noticeable improvement over the constant @xmath1 case .",
