    "recent years have witnessed great interest in two - dimensional ( 2d ) layered materials with honeycomb lattice structures .",
    "especially , the 2d group - iv honeycomb lattice materials , such as successively fabricated graphene ,  @xcite and silicene ,  @xcite have attracted considerable attention both theoretically and experimentally due to their low - energy dirac fermion behavior and promising applications in electronics .",
    "recently , we have discovered stable 2d hydrogenated and halogenated group - v honeycomb lattices via first - principles ( fp ) calculations .",
    "@xcite their structures are similar to that of a hydrogenated silicene ( silicane ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry](a ) . in the absence of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , the band structures show linear energy crossing at the fermi level around @xmath3 and @xmath4 points of the hexagonal brillouin zone .",
    "it is quite unusual that the low - energy bands of these materials are of @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbital character .",
    "previous studies in the context of cold atoms systems have shown that @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbital character could lead to various charge and orbital ordered states as well as topological effects .",
    "@xcite our proposed materials , being the first real condensed matter systems in which the low - energy physics is associated with @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals , are therefore expected to exhibit rich and interesting physical phenomena .        the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) insulator state has generated great interest in condensed matter physics and material science due to its scientific importance as a novel quantum state and its potential technological applications ranging from spintronics to topological quantum computation .",
    "@xcite this novel electronic state is gaped in the bulk and conducts charge and spin in gapless edge states without dissipation protected by time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the concept of qsh effect was first proposed by kane and mele in graphene in which soc opens a nontrivial band gap at the dirac points .",
    "@xcite subsequent works , however , showed that the soc for graphene is tiny , hence the effect is difficult to be detected experimentally .",
    "@xcite so far , qsh effect has only been demonstrated in hgte / cdte quantum wells ,  @xcite and experimental evidence for helical edge modes has been presented for inverted inas - gasb quantum wells .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , these existing systems more or less have serious limitations like toxicity , difficulty in processing , and small bulk gap opened by soc .",
    "therefore , an easy and environmental friendly realization of a qsh insulator is much desired .",
    "extensive effort has been devoted to the search for new qsh insulators with large soc gap .",
    "@xcite for instance , new layered honeycomb lattice type materials such as silicene , germanene  @xcite or stanene  @xcite , and chemically modified stanene  @xcite have been proposed .",
    "ultrathin bi(111 ) films have drawn attention as a candidate qsh insulator , whose 2d topological properties have been reported .",
    "@xcite an approach to design a large - gap qsh state on a semiconductor surface by a substrate orbital filtering process was also proposed .",
    "@xcite however , desirable qsh insulators preferably with huge bulk gaps are still rare .",
    "a sizable bulk band gap in qsh insulators is essential for realizing many exotic phenomena and for fabricating new quantum devices that can operate at room temperature .    using fp method ,",
    "we have recently demonstrated that the qsh effect can be realized in the 2d hydrogenated and halogenated group - v honeycomb monolayers family , with a huge gap opened at the dirac points due to soc .",
    "@xcite although the low - energy spectrum of these materials is similar to the 2d group - iv honeycomb monolayers such as graphene and silicene , the low - energy hilbert space changes from the @xmath2 orbital to orbitals mainly consisting of @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the group - v atoms ( n - bi ) .",
    "moreover , the nature of the effective soc differs between the two systems .",
    "motivated by the fundamental interest associated with the qsh effect and huge soc gaps in these novel 2d materials , we develop a low - energy effective model hamiltonian that captures their essential physics .",
    "in addition , we propose a minimal four - band lattice hamiltonian with the on - site soc term using only the @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals .        from the symmetry analysis , the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn )",
    "intrinsic rashba soc should exist in these systems due to the low - buckled structure , similar to the case of silicene .",
    "@xcite however , as we shall see , the dominant effect is from the much larger first - order soc of on - site origin .",
    "therefore , in the following discussion , we shall focus on the first - order on - site soc and neglect the higher - order effects .",
    "this point will be further discussed later in this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we derive step by step the low - energy effective hilbert subspace and hamiltonian for honeycomb _ x_-hydride ( _ x _ = n - bi ) monolayers , and also investigate in detail the effective soc .",
    "section iii presents the derivation of the low - energy effective model for _ x_-halide ( _ x _ = n - bi , halide = f - i ) honeycomb monolayers . in sec .",
    "iv , a simple spinful lattice hamiltonian for the honeycomb _ x_-hydride / halide monolayers family is constructed .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "v with a brief discussion of the effective soc and present a summary of our results .",
    "as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry](a ) , there are two distinct sites a and b in the unit cell of _ x_-hydride ( _ x _ = n - bi ) honeycomb lattice with full hydrogenation from both sides of the 2d _ x _ honeycomb sheet .",
    "the primitive lattice vectors are chosen as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the lattice constant .",
    "we consider the outer shell orbitals of textitx ( _ x _ = n - bi ) , namely @xmath10 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath11 , and also the @xmath10 orbital of h in the modeling .",
    "therefore , in the representation @xmath12 ( for simplicity , the dirac ket symbol is omitted in the following ) , the hamiltonian ( without soc ) at @xmath3 point with the nearest - neighbor hopping considered in the slater - koster formalism  @xcite reads    @xmath13    with @xmath14,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath15,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath16,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is the hopping between the @xmath2 ( @xmath10 ) orbital from _ x _ atom and the @xmath10 orbital from h , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 being the standard slater - koster hopping parameters . @xmath24 and @xmath25 are on - site energies for @xmath10 orbitals of atom _ x _ and of atom h , respectively .",
    "the on - site energies for @xmath26 orbitals are taken to be zero .",
    "to diagonalize the hamiltonian , we first perform the following unitary transformation : @xmath27,\\\\   & \\varphi_{4}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(p_{x}^{a}-ip_{y}^{a}\\right)-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(p_{x}^{b}+ip_{y}^{b}\\right)\\right ] . \\end{split}\\ ] ]    in the basis @xmath28 , the hamiltonian can be written as a block - diagonal form with three decoupled blocks @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 : @xmath32 @xmath33,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath34 with @xmath35,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath36,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the eigenvectors for the first diagonal block @xmath29 can be easily obtained as @xmath40,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xmath43 are the corresponding eigenvalues and normalization factors , respectively .",
    "therefore , upon performing the unitary transformation @xmath44 with @xmath45 , the above upper - left @xmath46 block @xmath47 is diagonalized .    for the second diagonal block @xmath30 ,",
    "its eigenvalues are denoted as @xmath48 @xmath43 , and it can be easily shown that @xmath49 , where @xmath41 are eigenvalues of @xmath29 . this is consistent with fp results , i.e. , there are four two - fold degeneracy points at @xmath3 point as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands](a ) .",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath30 are given by @xmath50,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xmath51 are the corresponding eigenvalues and normalization factors .",
    "similar to the case of @xmath29 , upon performing the unitary transformation @xmath52 with @xmath53 , the block @xmath30 is diagonalized .    the third block @xmath31 is already diagonal with eigenvalues @xmath54 and eigenvectors @xmath55 . therefore , in the new basis @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , the total hamiltonian  ( [ h0 ] ) takes a fully diagonlized form .",
    "the whole diagonalization process can be summarized as follows : @xmath58 where @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61    from the band components projection as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands](a ) , in the vicinity of the dirac points ( around fermi level ) , the main components of the band come from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals of group - v element textitx mixed with a small amount of @xmath10 orbital of textitx . compared with the expressions of the eigenstates obtained above , we find that the orbital features agree with that of @xmath62 and @xmath63 if we take their eigenenergies as the fermi energy . therefore the corresponding states @xmath64 and @xmath65 constitute the low - energy hilbert subspace . in the following",
    ", we will give the explicit forms of the low - energy states @xmath64 and @xmath65 as well as their eigenvalues .    note",
    "that , in the above @xmath46 @xmath29 , the scale of the @xmath66 non - diagonal block @xmath67 is smaller than the difference of the typical eigenvalues between the upper @xmath66 diagonal block @xmath68 and the lower @xmath66 diagonal block @xmath69 .",
    "hence , through the downfolding procedure  @xcite , we could obtain the low - energy effective hamiltonian as @xmath70 up to the second order , one obtains @xmath71 with @xmath72 consequently , we can obtain the explicit expressions of @xmath73 and @xmath64 . in a similar way , the explicit expressions of @xmath74 and @xmath65 can also be obtained .",

    "further simplification could be made in order to capture the main physics .",
    "we can omit the second - order correction for the eigenvalues and the first - order correction for the eigenvectors , i.e. , the terms @xmath78 for @xmath64 and @xmath79 for @xmath65 , and only keep the zeroth - order eigenvectors and eigenvalues , @xmath80 this approximation is justified by our fp calculations , namely in the vicinity of the fermi level , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath10 orbitals overwhelmingly dominate over the @xmath81 and @xmath11 orbitals in the band components .    in the hamiltonian",
    ", one can take the fermi energy @xmath82 as energy zero point .",
    "hence , states @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which constitute the low - energy hilbert subspace , take the following explicit forms : @xmath83+u_{21}^{\\alpha}s^{b } ,   \\\\   & \\phi_{5}=u_{11}^{\\alpha}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(p_{x}^{b}-ip_{y}^{b}\\right)\\right]-u_{21}^{\\alpha}s^{a } , \\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ] with @xmath84    since we are interested in the low - energy physics near the dirac point , we perform the small @xmath85 expansion around @xmath3 by @xmath86 and keep the terms that are first order in @xmath85 .",

    ", the above model hamiltonian reduces to the low - energy effective hamiltonian [ eq .   and  ] with @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "taking sbh as an example , we compare the results from fp calculations and from the lattice models . as shown in fig .",

    "we have obtained the low - energy effective hamiltonian for the textitx - hydride and textitx - halide ( _ x _ = n - bi ) family of materials , which is analogous to the kane - mele model proposed for the qsh effect in graphene .",
    "@xcite the important difference is that in kane - mele model the effective soc is of second - order nnn type , which is much weaker than the on - site soc in our systems .",
    "the soc term in our hamiltonian opens a large nontrivial gap at the dirac points . from @xmath3",
    "to @xmath4 the mass term changes sign for each spin species and the band is inverted . as a result , the qsh effect can be realized in the textitx - hydride and textitx - halide ( _ x _ = n - bi ) monolayers .",
    "some of these materials , such as bih / bif , have record huge soc gap with magnitude around 1 ev , far higher than the room - temperature energy scale , hence making their detection much easier .    on the experimental side , the buckling honeycomb bi(111 ) monolayer and film",
    "have been manufactured via molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , chemical functionalization of 2d materials is a powerful tool to create new materials with desirable features , such as modifying graphene into graphane , graphone , and fluorinated graphene via h and f , respectively .",
    "@xcite therefore , it is very promising that bi - hydride / halide monolayer , the huge gap qsh insulators , may be synthesized by chemical reaction in the solvents or by the exposure of the bi ( 111 ) monolayer and film to the atomic or molecular gases .",
    "it is noted that even though one side ( full passivation ) instead of both sides ( alternating passivation ) of bi(111 ) bilayers is passivated , the band structure is almost unchanged and the topology properties remain nontrivial .",
    "this will provide more freedom to realize these kinds of materials .",
    "it is known that the low - energy hilbert space for graphene consists of the @xmath11 orbital from carbon atoms . in that system ,",
    "the soc term from nnn second - order processes is vanishingly small , and the on - site soc as well as the nearest neighbor soc are forbidden by symmetry constraint .",
    "in contrast , for the honeycomb textitx - hydride / halide monolayers , @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals from the group v elements constitute the low - energy hilbert subspace .",
    "in fact , this represents the first class of materials for which the dirac fermion physics is associated with @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals .",
    "because of this , the effective on - site soc can has nonzero matrix elements and results in the huge soc gap at the dirac points .",
    "the leading - order effective soc processes in the textitx - hydride and textitx - halide systems , silicene , and graphene are schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : soc_hopping ] . as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : soc_hopping]4(a ) and 4(b ) , the representative leading - order effective soc processes around the @xmath3 point in the honeycomb textitx - hydride and textitx - halide monolayers are @xmath133 where @xmath108 represents the atomic spin - orbit interaction strength , which is given in eq .   for textitx - hydride systems and eq .   for textitx - halide systems .",
    "in a hilbert subspace consisting of @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals , such effective soc arises in the first - order on - site processes , which leads to its huge magnitude .    as for silicene , which has a low - buckled structure ,",
    "the typical leading - order soc is from the ( first - order ) nnn processes ,  @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : soc_hopping](c ) , @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the nearest - neighbor direct hopping amplitude and @xmath103 represents the atomic intrinsic soc strength .",
    "the whole process can be divided into three steps .",
    "for example , we consider the @xmath136 orbital .",
    "firstly , due to the low - buckled structure , @xmath137 couples to @xmath138 . carriers in @xmath137 orbital then hop to the nearest neighbor @xmath139 orbital .",
    "secondly , the atomic intrinsic soc shifts the energy of the spin up and spin down carriers by @xmath140 . in the third step , carriers in the @xmath138 orbital hop to another nearest - neighbor @xmath136 orbital , making the resulting effective soc an nnn process and of first order in @xmath141 .    as for graphene , around dirac point ,",

    "[ fig : soc_hopping](d ) : @xmath142 during the whole nnn hopping process , the atomic soc appears twice , making the effective soc second order in @xmath141 and hence much weaker .        in summary , using the tb method and the fp calculation , we have derived the low - energy effective hilbert subspace and hamiltonian for the honeycomb textitx - hydride / halide monolayers materials .",
    "these 2d group - v honeycomb lattice materials have the same low - energy effective hamiltonian due to their same @xmath143 point group symmetry and the same @xmath144 small group at the @xmath3 and @xmath4 points .",
    "the low - energy model contains two key parameters @xmath88 and @xmath108 .",
