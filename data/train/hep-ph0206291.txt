    "it is of crucial importance to know how much long - distance final - state interaction ( ldfsi ) occurs in @xmath0 decay .",
    "if ldfsi plays a significant role , we have no first - principle method to compute decay amplitudes .",
    "arguments have been presented in favor of short - distance ( sd ) dominance for the two - body decay in which a fast quark - antiquark pair moves almost collinearly in a colorless lump .",
    "based on this color screening picture@xcite , the perturbative qcd computation has been carried out for the two - body @xmath0 decay@xcite . even if the sd dominance argument is valid in the infinite @xmath0 mass limit , a quantitative question exists about the accuracy of the perturbative qcd calculation since the @xmath0 meson mass is only 5.3 gev in the real world . when the final mesons are highly excited states , the velocities of the mesons are less fast and the quarks inside them have larger transverse momenta .",
    "we expect that the sd dominance is accordingly less accurate in such decays . in the large limit of the excited meson mass",
    ", the ldfsi should play a major role in determining the final state .",
    "we would like to verify experimentally the sd dominance in the two - body decay and see how the sd dominance disappears as the meson slows down in the inclusive decay .",
    "one of the cleanest ways to test breakdown of the sd dominance or presence of ldfsi directly with experiment is to measure the helicity of a fast flying meson in the final state@xcite .",
    "since sd interactions do no flip helicities of light quarks ( @xmath1 ) , a fast light meson carries a memory of the quark helicities if no ldfsi enters .",
    "because of the specific form of the weak interaction in the standard model , a fast light meson with spin must be polarized in the zero helicity state up to @xmath2 in probability , when other hadrons fly away approximately to the opposite directions .",
    "one can determine the @xmath3 fraction of the meson by measuring the angular distribution of the its decay products .",
    "in fact , this selection rule is so robust that it would be valid even if the right - handed @xmath4-boson contributes to weak decays .",
    "it breaks down most likely by ldfsi , if at all .",
    "imagine that such polarization measurement is made for the inclusive decay @xmath5 in which @xmath6 is a highly excited meson state ( @xmath7 ) or a multi - quark hadronic state . as the invariant mass @xmath8 increases ,",
    "it becomes more likely that ldfsi takes place between @xmath9 and @xmath6 .",
    "if so , we shall start seeing production of the @xmath9 meson in the @xmath10 states . by measuring the @xmath9 helicity as a function of @xmath11 or equivalently as a function of the @xmath9 energy in the @xmath0 rest frame",
    ", we can determine from experiment how much ldfsi enters the decay as @xmath9 slows down or how much the color screening breaks down .",
    "for the two - body decay , the polarization measurement is possible only when both final mesons have nonzero spins , for instance , @xmath12 .",
    "meanwhile , most decay modes that are easily identifiable and high in branching fraction are @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "nonetheless , the polarization test will have a direct impact on these dominant decay modes of the @xmath0 meson in the following way . in the charmless @xmath0 decay",
    ", the two - body decays @xmath15 and @xmath16 are among the decay modes of primary interest from the viewpoint of cp violation .",
    "if our proposed test reveals that the @xmath3 state dominates in @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and so forth , we shall feel more confident with computing the tree and penguin amplitudes of @xmath19 , @xmath16 in perturbative qcd .",
    "if on the contrary the @xmath3 dominance is substantially violated in @xmath17 , @xmath18 , we should not trust the perturbative method of calculation for @xmath19 , @xmath16 . in this case the only recourse would be to determine the @xmath15 amplitudes by experiment alone@xcite without help of theoretical computation . and little",
    "could be done for @xmath20 with isospin invariance alone .",
    "the test proposed here is not for inventing a new method of calculation of decay amplitudes , but for learning from experiment for which decay modes we may perform the perturbative qcd calculation .",

    "if the transverse polarization appears beyond the corrections to be discussed in the subsequent sections , it will be a clear evidence for ldfsi .",

    "the helicity selection rule should break down for sufficiently large values of @xmath8 .",
    "at which value the rule starts showing a significant departure from the @xmath3 dominance will provide us with a quantitative measure of accuracy of the perturbative qcd calculation .",

    "a pair of @xmath7 is produced by weak interaction nearly in parallel to form an energetic meson . in the case of a vector meson @xmath82",

    "repeat the argument for @xmath86 . projecting the @xmath7 state with the quark distribution function of meson , we find that the meson helicity consists entirely of the quark helicity @xmath105 in the fast limit .",

    "when one of @xmath22 and @xmath115 is formed with @xmath116 or with @xmath117 , this meson is in the @xmath3 state .",
    "the angular momentum conservation along the decay momenta in the @xmath0 rest frame requires that the helicity of the other meson must also be zero ( fig.1a ) .",
    "therefore @xmath80 dominates in this case . alternatively with @xmath118 ,",
    "if @xmath119 is combined to form one meson , the other meson must be made of the spectator @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "then the net helicity of the second meson can be only @xmath122 or @xmath123 , which does not match the helicity @xmath67 of the first meson ( fig.1b ) .",

    "this argument is valid only in the limit that the massless @xmath85 and @xmath86 move strictly in parallel and there is no relative motion between them inside the meson .",
    "the relative motion of @xmath125 generates a correction to this helicity selection rule .",
    "since the motion of light quarks makes up the entire mass of a nonflavored meson , this correction should be @xmath126 in amplitude , where @xmath100 is the meson mass and @xmath127 for two - body decays .",

    "the reason is obvious from the preceding argument : it is the meson formed by the energetic @xmath7 originating from the effective decay interaction that primarily determines the helicity state , since the helicity of the other side that receives the spectator has a twofold uncertainty due to the indefinite spectator helicity .",
    "the helicity of the meson carrying the spectator is constrained by the overall angular momentum conservation . in the case of the @xmath141 meson , the mass corrections to @xmath134 and",
    "@xmath135 are interchanged in the same argument .",
    "we should recall that there is also the @xmath101 correction of @xmath142 in probability in the case that a meson has @xmath89 .",

    "we can easily see that the helicities of @xmath22 and @xmath6 do not match for @xmath10 even when @xmath22 receives @xmath120 .",
    "the only helicity final state compatible with the overall angular momentum conservation is still @xmath157 in the collinear limit .",
    "therefore , the preceding argument for the two - body decay @xmath113 is carried over to the inclusive decay @xmath79 .",

    ", the final helicity state is determined primarily by the meson ( @xmath22 ) or the group of mesons ( @xmath6 ) that does not receive @xmath120 of indefinite helicity . making an appropriate substitution in the mass corrections for the two - body decay , we obtain for @xmath160 @xmath161 the right - hand sides indicate the orders of magnitude .",
    "it is difficult even within perturbative qcd to compute their coefficients with good accuracy since they depend on the quark distributions inside mesons and other details .",

    "nonetheless , the rise of @xmath162 with @xmath11 , particularly in the case that @xmath6 is produced without the spectator , is an important trend .",
    "it simply means that the `` small opposite helicity component '' of @xmath163 ceases to be small when @xmath8 becomes large .    the orbital motion inside @xmath6 is not restricted to @xmath164 .",

    ", which would lead to @xmath245 in the ordinary sign convention chosen in its reference@xcite . it might look as if the babar result were in direct conflict with the prediction of perturbative qcd for @xmath239 .",
    "in fact , the other solution @xmath246 leading to @xmath244 is also allowed by this experiment , though not explicitly quoted as such@xcite . therefore no conclusion can be drawn from this experiment as to which is larger between @xmath134 and @xmath135 in @xmath140 .",
    "the same comment applies to the latest belle analysis@xcite . ]",
    "the belle collaboration recently measured the branching fraction for the factorization - suppressed decay @xmath247@xcite at the level comparable with the factorization - favored decays @xmath248 , @xmath249 , and @xmath250 .",
    "it shows that the simple factorization clearly fails in the decay @xmath251 charmonium .",
    "the decay @xmath252 is being analyzed at the b - factories .",
    "the branching fraction was reported for @xmath253@xcite .",
    "after accumulation of more events , the helicity analysis will become feasible .",
    "comparison of this decay with @xmath140 may provide an additional useful information about dynamics in @xmath254 .",
    "the helicity test can be performed for higher - spin inclusive processes @xmath256 with @xmath255 for @xmath115 .",
    "for @xmath257 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the differential decay rate in the @xmath0 rest frame takes the form , @xmath258 where @xmath259 is the helicity of @xmath115 .",
    "the momentum @xmath260 and the angle @xmath60 are defined in the same way as in eq.([angular ] ) . in the case of @xmath68 for @xmath25 and/or @xmath26",
    ", an additional @xmath259 dependence enters through the decay @xmath261 .",
    "the dominant helicity structure function is @xmath80 , then @xmath262 for both @xmath0 and @xmath263 decays , since the @xmath99 correction to @xmath115 contributes to @xmath134 and @xmath135 in the same order .",
    "if perturbative qcd is valid , the function @xmath81 with @xmath264 can not arise without the @xmath99 correction .",
    "@xmath45 with @xmath265 beyond the @xmath99 correction will be a clear evidence for ldfsi . as @xmath8 tends to its maximum value",
    ", @xmath173 should approach @xmath266 . in the decay @xmath267 ,",
    "for instance , the angular dependence @xmath268 appears as @xmath269 slows down .",
    "appearance of @xmath270 indicates that the orbital angular momentum of @xmath7 inside @xmath269 becomes important in the @xmath0 rest frame .",
    "one might think of attributing appearance of @xmath265 to possible breakdown of the @xmath7 description of @xmath269 .",
    "but it is unlikely in the face of the static quark model : the @xmath7 description of low - lying mesons works well both in the infinite momentum limit and in the static limit albeit the physical nature of quarks is different between the two limits . as @xmath71 , all @xmath99 states of @xmath269",
    "are equally produced and @xmath173 should approach 1/5 .",
    "various tests have so far been proposed concerning validity of the factorization .",
    "the most straightforward is to compute as many decay amplitudes as possible with theoretical resources at hand . in some simple cases we are fortunate to have only a single dominant decay process in the factorization limit .",
    "an example is @xmath271 . otherwise a decay amplitude for a given process is sum of competing contributions of more than one decay process .",
    "once short - distance qcd corrections are included , the quark operators producing mesons are nonlocal .",
    "then we need to know not only the decay constants , the wave functions at origin , but also the entire light - cone quark distribution functions in order to obtain a single decay amplitude .",
    "furthermore , the relevant energy scale of the qcd coupling @xmath272 can take different values depending on how and where it appears .",
    "therefore a final number for a total decay amplitude is sensitive to small theoretical uncertainties of each contribution particularly when different terms enter with different signs .",
    "these added uncertainties make comparison of theory with experiment less decisive . for this reason we give up here attempting numerical estimate of the coefficients of the corrections to the @xmath3 dominance rule even for the simplest two - body decay @xmath12 .",
    "a while ago ligeti _",
    "et al._@xcite proposed a test of the factorization in the decay @xmath273 .",
    "they proposed to compare the @xmath8 distribution of this inclusive decay with the @xmath274 distribution of the semileptonic decay @xmath275 .",
    "it appears to be a clean test . in order for this test to work ,",
    "however , @xmath6 must be produced from a single weak current just as @xmath276 is .",
    "therefore , it applies to @xmath277 ( and the conjugate ) through the dominant decay operator , but not to @xmath278 ( and the conjugate ) since @xmath279 can pick either the current quark @xmath280 or the spectator @xmath280 in the @xmath281 decay .",
    "only the neutral @xmath0 decay is possibly related to the semileptonic decay .",
    "the most important difference from our test is that the comparison with the semileptonic decay tests only validity of the factorization before the perturbative qcd improvement .",
    "the sdfsi surely plays a significant role in the final state and breaks down the similarity between the nonleptonic and the semileptonic decay .",
    "an alternative to this test was proposed for two - body decays and importance of spin was mentioned@xcite , but it is not free of the uncertainties and complications in theoretical computation . in contrast ,",
    "the inclusive helicity measurement tests not just the lowest - order factorization but its perturbative qcd corrections to all orders independent of theoretical details",
    ". it will provide us with an important information as to how much long - distance qcd interactions enter a given process and allow us to use it for related processes .",
    "a negative side of the helicity test is , of course , the common drawback of ldfsi that after ldfsi is found , we can not compute phases nor magnitudes of decay amplitudes from the first principle .",
    "however , just measuring cp violations beyond the @xmath282-@xmath283 mixing effect will be important even if we can not easily relate it to fundamental parameters of theory .",
    "only when ldfsi is significant , do we have a chance to detect a direct cp violation from particle - antiparticle asymmetry .",
    "the helicity test will hopefully tell us which decay modes we should go after for search of direct cp violations .",
