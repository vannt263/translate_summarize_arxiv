    "self - propelled particles undergo active brownian motion by consuming energy , obtained either from internal or external sources .",
    "examples range from the transport of motor proteins on cytoskeletal filaments @xcite which is a biologically relevant system , to the motion of self - motile colloidal particles @xcite as a nonliving realization .",
    "the particles are powered by the hydrolysis of atp in the former case , whereas they use a chemical reaction catalyzed on their surface to swim in the latter example .",
    "the directed propulsion subject to fluctuations has been described by persistent random walks @xcite , where a tendency to move along the previous direction is taken into account .",
    "a strong self - propulsion overcomes the stochastic fluctuations and directs the motion , which renders it ballistic for short time scales @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the interplay between self - propulsion and random motion in general may lead to various scenarios of anomalous diffusive dynamics on varying time scales @xcite .",
    "the influence of self - propulsion diminishes over time and eventually a crossover to an asymptotic diffusive regime occurs .    even in the absence of self - propulsion , the stochastic motion of particle",
    "may remain complicated because in general a random walker can perform steps with arbitrary turning angles and variable step lengths .",
    "moreover , there can be a relation between the step size and the turning angle of each step .",
    "generalized random walks had been studied e.g.  in the context of animal and cell movements as a markovian process @xcite , i.e.   by considering the motion as a series of independent draws from the step - length and turning - angle distributions for each step .",
    "while the focus of prior studies has been more on the asymptotic diffusion coefficient of such random walks , the short - time behavior is neither thoroughly investigated nor completely understood .    in the persistent random walk model that we study here a particle moves straight in continuous space in a randomly chosen direction over a randomly chosen distance and then changes direction by a randomly chosen turning angle .",
    "the typical trajectories of the random walker depend strongly on the chosen turning angle and distance distributions . for small values of the angular change",
    "the new direction will be strongly correlated with the old direction , introducing a directional memory into the model without changing the markov property of the process .",
    "the emerging intermittent directional bias is controlled by the characteristics ( mean , width , asymmetry , etc . ) of the turning angle distribution and the probability with which the direction is unchanged , i.e.   the processivity .",
    "the bias decays with time after a few turns and the directions of the particle motion become asymptotically randomized .",
    "memory effects have also been included in other random walk models . in fractional",
    "brownian motion @xcite , sub or superdiffusive motion is observed asymptotically . in continuous time",
    "random walk ( ctrw ) models @xcite , for example , true non - markovian effects can be implemented via broad waiting time distributions which lead to a subdiffusive dynamics of the walker . although these approaches are conceptually very exciting , a direct comparison to experimental results is sometimes difficult . in case of intracellular transport , for example ,",
    "spatial confinement as well as a finite observation time imply that the asymptotic behavior of the walker is not accessible .    here",
    ", we develop a general analytical framework to study persistent random walks over the whole range of time scales .",
    "the goal is to clarify and disentangle the combined effects of self - propulsion @xmath0 and the stepping strategy of the walker , consisting of its step - length @xmath1 and turning - angle @xmath2 distributions .",
    "the method enables us to analytically determine the time evolution of arbitrary moments of displacement . using this approach , the second moment , i.e.  the mean square displacement ,",
    "has been recently analyzed @xcite revealing a variety of signatures of anomalous diffusion on short time scales even in the absence of viscoelasticity , traps , or overcrowding .",
    "these elements were frequently identified in the nature of the biological environments and received considerable attention as the possible sources of subdiffusion @xcite .    an alternative way to interpret the model and",
    "its outcome is to consider the motion on complex networks , such as motor proteins on the cytoskeleton .",
    "these motors have an effective processivity @xmath0 ( i.e.  a tendency to move along the same filament @xcite ) and may switch to a new filament at the intersections of the network . from a coarse - grained perspective , one can describe such motion by a persistent random walk on the nodes of the network , thus , @xmath1 and @xmath2 represent the distributions of the segment - length @xmath3 between neighboring intersections and the angle @xmath4 between intersecting filaments , respectively .",
    "note that the cytoskeleton is a dynamic network due to the underlying growth and shrinkage of filaments , thus , the structure on which the transport takes place often changes .",
    "this justifies the relevance of the proposed stochastic approach , where the network structure is always implicitly given .",
    "our analytical approach provides a recipe to obtain any arbitrary moment of displacement , yet we extend the calculations to the third and fourth moments , which are of particular interest , e.g.  in the evaluation of the skewness and kurtosis , or to obtain the variance @xmath5 ( and thus the standard error ) of the mean square displacement ( msd ) of a persistent random walker .",
    "@xmath6 is also a useful quantity for estimating the first moment @xmath7 of the net displacement : in the absence of an exact analytical solution for @xmath7 , an approximate expression @xmath8 was proposed @xcite by means of a taylor expansion of the square root function .",
    "the asymptotic behavior is however shown to follow @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we first introduce the general approach to obtain arbitrary moments of displacement .",
    "next , an analytical expression is derived for the special case of the mean square displacement in two dimensions .",
    "this part is the full exposition and expansion of the results presented in @xcite .",
    "then we clarify the similarities and differences between the results in two and three dimensions for persistent walks which are symmetric around the previous direction of motion , and briefly discuss the case of asymmetric turning - angle distributions in two dimensions .",
