    "the reaction rate of the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3na reaction provides a route from hot cno - cycles to the nena and mgal cycles and finally to the @xmath4-process  at typical temperatures of e.g.  about @xmath7gk ( @xmath8 ) in x - ray bursters ( xrb ) @xcite .",
    "it is expected that this reaction is the dominating route in the low temperature range @xcite .",
    "an alternative route from hot cno - cycles to the @xmath4-process  may be the @xmath9o(@xmath1,@xmath10)@xmath11ne reaction .",
    "the relatively high temperatures correspond to most effective energies of about 1.3 to 2.1mev for the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3na reaction which are experimentally well accessible .",
    "however , experiments remain very difficult because of the short - living @xmath0ne nucleus ( @xmath12s ) and the limited intensity of radioactive beam facilities .",
    "thus , besides the direct approach of measuring the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3na reaction cross section @xcite , the reverse @xmath3na(@xmath2,@xmath1)@xmath0ne reaction has been studied very recently @xcite and in an earlier unpublished experiment @xcite , and the resonance energies have been determined from various transfer experiments populating states in the compound @xmath13 mg nucleus @xcite .",

    "the earlier direct data of @xcite have been improved and extended by the same group leading to the gro data .",
    "the sal data are the only published data for the inverse reaction ; a brief comparison to the unpublished data measured at argonne national laboratory ( anl ) is also provided .",
    "the mat transfer data have by far the best energy resolution which is essential for a precise determination of the resonance energies . additional measurements of angular distributions in cha lead to a new spin assignment only in few cases ( see table iii of cha ) .",
    "the reaction rate factor @xmath5   for the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3na reaction is given by the sum over the contributing resonances : @xmath14 with the reduced mass @xmath15 in units of amu , the resonance energies @xmath16 in mev , and the resonance strengths @xmath17 in mev .",
    "in general , resonance energies are given as @xmath18 in the center - of - mass ( c.m.)system without index ; excitation energies are given as @xmath19 in this paper .",
    "the resonance strength @xmath20 for the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3na reaction is given by @xmath21 with the resonance spin @xmath22 , the partial widths @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and the total width @xmath25 .",

    "( [ eq : rate ] ) is justified because the resonance widths @xmath28 are much smaller than the resonance energies @xmath18 @xcite .    in the following",
    "we first briefly review the various experimental approaches and discuss the resulting uncertainties in the determination of the reaction rate factor @xmath5 .",
    "next we check whether the experimental results of gro , mat , cha , sal , and anl are compatible with each other .",
    "finally , the reaction rate factors @xmath5  of the different studies are compared .",
    "note that @xmath5  of different studies may differ not only from discrepant resonance energies and resonance strengths or cross sections , but also from a different number of considered resonances in eq .",

    "various transfer experiments have been performed in the last decade to study properties of the compound nucleus @xmath13 mg @xcite .",
    "a detailed comparison of the results is provided in mat and is not repeated . here",
    "we briefly summarize the mat results and some modifications resulting from the cha data .",
    "transfer data are able to provide excitation energies @xmath19 and spin and parity @xmath29 of states in @xmath13 mg . however , from the transfer data it is not possible to determine resonance strengths @xmath30 which are the second ingredient for the calculation of the rate factor @xmath5  in eq .",

    "approach the @xmath31mg(@xmath2,@xmath32)@xmath13 mg reaction is used to populate excited states in the compound nucleus @xmath13 mg at proton energies of slightly below 100mev .",
    "the experiment has been performed using the grand raiden spectrometer at rcnp , osaka .",
    "the excellent energy resolution of about 13kev allows a precise determination of excitation energies @xmath19 which enter exponentially into @xmath5  in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate ] ) via @xmath33 ( with the separation energy of the @xmath1  particle in @xmath13 mg of @xmath34mev ) and are thus the main source of uncertainties .",
    "( @xmath34mev is taken from the new audi and meng compilation @xcite ; the small difference to the earlier result of @xmath35mev @xcite does practically not affect the rate factor @xmath5  in the relevant temperature range around @xmath8 . )",
    "in addition to the excitation energies @xmath19 , the total widths @xmath28 can be determined from these data by fitting the observed peak widths @xmath36 .",
    "most of the observed states are much broader than the experimental resolution , and thus the required unfolding procedure leads only to minor additional uncertainties for the derived width @xmath28 .",
    "the results are listed in table [ tab : width ] . as can be seen from table [ tab : width ] , practically all resonances fulfill the criterion of @xmath37 which is often used as definition for narrow resonances ( although also more stringent definitions for narrow resonances can be found in literature ) . as we will show in sect .",
    "[ sec : cha ] , the simple formula for narrow resonances in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate ] ) provides the reaction rate factor @xmath5  for the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3na reaction with sufficient accuracy . in this sense the resonances in table [ tab : width ] can be considered generally as narrow resonances .",

    "later revisions for individual states are marked by `` @xmath38 '' and `` @xmath39 '' ; these revisions are based on the replacement of the experimental resonance strengths of gro by calculated resonance strengths and on revised ( but still tentative ) spin assignments by cha @xcite ( see also table [ tab : mod ] ) .",

    "the present knowledge of the reaction rate factor @xmath5  of the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3na reaction has been summarized . for this purpose experimental results from different experimental techniques are combined .",
    "transfer reactions provide the best determination of the excitation energy @xmath19 and spin and parity @xmath29 of states in @xmath13 mg which appear as resonances in the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3na reaction ; however , transfer reactions can not provide the required resonance strengths @xmath30 .",
    "these strengths have to be taken from theory or from direct experiments which are however extremely difficult and require the combination of a radioactive @xmath0ne beam and a helium gas target .",
    "complementary information has been derived from the experimental study of the reverse @xmath3na(@xmath2,@xmath1)@xmath0ne reaction using a radioactive @xmath3na beam and a solid ch@xmath40 target .",
    "a basic prerequisite for the comparison of results from various experimental techniques is the availability of total widths @xmath28 for the resonances under study .",
    "the total widths @xmath28 were determined from a reanalysis of the peak widths in the mat experiment .",
    "a compatibility test between the results from various experimental techniques shows that there is no contradiction between the various experimental data except the disagreement between the direct gro data and the reverse reaction data from sal and anl .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the most likely explanation is a problem in the normalization of the gro data .",
    "consequently , resonance strengths from gro have been replaced by theoretical resonance strengths in the calculation of the rate factor @xmath5 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath5  for the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3na reaction from transfer data requires theoretical resonance strengths , and the calculation of @xmath5  from the reverse @xmath3na(@xmath2,@xmath1)@xmath0ne reaction data requires a theoretical estimate of the ( @xmath1,@xmath41 ) ground - state branching .",
    "both calculations are based on simple but reasonable arguments , and the corresponding uncertainties should not exceed a factor of two .",
    "this leads to a relatively narrow overlap region between the higher @xmath5  calculated from transfer and the lower @xmath5  calculated from the reverse reaction data .",
    "this narrow overlap region is considered as the new recommended reaction rate factor @xmath5@xmath42 .",
    "the uncertainty of the recommended rate factor is about a factor of 1.8 ( @xmath43 uncertainty ) .",
    "for @xmath44 a theoretical prediction @xcite lies within this error band , but the theoretical temperature dependence of the rate factor @xmath5  is somewhat steeper than the new recommendation .",
    "the new recommended rate factor is slightly lower than the mat rate factor at low temperatures and significantly smaller at higher temperatures , and the new rate factor exceeds the sal result by about a factor of 5 .",
    "the strong conclusion of sal ( based on their lower limit for the rate factor @xmath5 ) that `` the breakout from the hcno cycle via the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3na reaction is delayed and occurs at higher temperatures than previously predicted '' can not be supported . instead , because of the only minor deviations of @xmath5@xmath42 from the mat result at low temperatures around @xmath45 , the earlier conclusions of mat should remain valid in general . further astrophysical network calculations with the new recommended rate factor @xmath5@xmath42 are required to study the relevance of the modified temperature dependence of the rate factor in detail .",
