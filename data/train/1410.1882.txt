    ", the complexity of the problem mostly requires one to resort to numerical studies ( as cited above ) or to focus on limiting cases where the system evolution is eventually dominated by a single mode with maximum gain or minimum loss .",

    "however , even for very simple scenarios , these exact case studies are mathematically already quite involved , and the translation of the observed dynamics to other systems , in particular to realistic systems with imperfections and noise , is not immediately obvious .    in this work",
    "we analyse quasi - adiabatic dynamics in non - hermitian systems near eps with the aim to provide a generalised framework for both modelling and understanding the associated dynamical phenomena .",
    "our approach reveals that the solutions are in general composed of periods of quasi - stationary during which the solution follows fixed points , interrupted by abrupt non - adiabatic transitions due to the exchange of stability .",
    "however , the time of these transitions can not be predicted by a standard stability analysis , and , intriguingly , we find that piece - wise adiabaticity is still a key ingredient for understanding the evolution of the system in spite of an overall breakdown of adiabatic principles .    on a more fundamental level , our analysis shows that the quasi - adiabatic dynamics near an ep is a singluarly perturbed problem  @xcite , meaning that , in contrast to hermitian systems , the dynamics can not be obtained by perturbative corrections to the adiabatic prediction .",

    "this chiral behavior , first presented in ref .",

    "@xcite for a concise description .",
    "the reason that the critical times do not coincide with the observed times when an instantaneous fixed point loses stability is because our slow - fast system is _ singularly perturbed _ ; the slow system is described by an algebraic equation , while the fast system by a differential equation .",

    "<S> the appearance of so - called exceptional points in the complex spectra of non - hermitian systems is often associated with phenomena that contradict our physical intuition . </S>",
    "<S> one example of particular interest is the state - exchange process predicted for an adiabatic encircling of an exceptional point . in this work we analyse this and related processes for the generic system of two coupled oscillator modes with loss or gain . </S>",
    "<S> we identify a characteristic system evolution consisting of periods of quasi - stationarity interrupted by abrupt non - adiabatic transitions , and we present a qualitative and quantitative description of this switching behaviour by connecting the problem to the phenomenon of stability loss delay . </S>",
    "<S> this approach makes accurate predictions for the breakdown of the adiabatic theorem as well as the occurrence of chiral behavior observed previously in this context , and provides a general framework to model and understand quasi - adiabatic dynamical effects in non - hermitian systems . </S>"
