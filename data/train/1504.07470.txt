    "it is well established from solar physics and the hugely successful soho mission that helioseismology @xcite may provide insights into the physics beneath a star s surface . following on from this ,",
    "missions like corot and kepler @xcite have firmly established asteroseismology as a precision science . however , in order to make use of the seismology strategy one must have a good theoretical understanding of the physics involved and the nature of the star s various oscillation modes .",
    "one also relies on nature to provide a mechanism that excites these modes to a detectable amplitude . in the case of the sun ,",
    "the interior physics is ( by now ) relatively well understood and we know that interior dynamics can be excited by convection .",
    "the situation is quite different when it comes to extreme objects like neutron stars .",
    "these , highly degenerate , systems also support a plethora of oscillation modes and it has been demonstrated how different aspects of supranuclear physics may influence these stars oscillations @xcite .",
    "however , we are still quite far from a complete picture ( partly because the physics of the deep core of these stars remains poorly understood and partly because of difficulties in building models that account for the rich physics we know we have to include ) .",
    "the neutron - star problem is interesting ( and topical ) since an oscillating neutron star may radiate gravitational waves at a level that would be within reach of the advanced ground based detectors that are now coming online . in practice",
    ", this would require large - amplitude oscillations due to some kind of instability being active @xcite .",
    "given this , it is understandable that much recent effort has been focussed on various neutron - star instabilities ( e.g. the gravitational - wave driven instability of the inertial r - modes @xcite or the f - modes @xcite ) .",
    "the matter composition in the star plays a key role in determining the fluid dynamics .",
    "basically , the richer the `` chemistry '' , the more complex the phenomenology may be .",
    "variations in composition generally enables moving fluid elements to experience buoyancy whenever they are out of equilibrium with their surroundings .",
    "this leads to the presence of the so - called gravity g - modes . in more familiar settings ,",
    "e.g. the sun , the main stratification is thermal . in contrast ,",
    "neutron stars tend to be so cold that thermal effects are irrelevant .",
    "nevertheless , local fluid elements may experience buoyancy due to composition gradients @xcite .",
    "this problem has been studied at some level of detail for simple neutron star models ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the relevance for various astrophysical scenarios , ranging from hot proto - neutron stars @xcite and adolescent stars @xcite , to tidal interactions @xcite , various instabilities @xcite , and the dynamics associated with core collapse and the generation of gravitational waves @xcite , has been considered .",
    "more realistic neutron - star models have not yet been considered in particular detail , although it is known that interfaces associated with phase transitions will lead to the presence of a family of modes closely related to the g - modes @xcite .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that the onset of superfluidity has a key influence on the buoyancy that supports the g - modes . in simple models ,",
    "the support for the g - modes may , in fact , disappear altogether .",
    "the traditional view is that one would not expect the convection that drives observed oscillations in main - sequence stars like the sun to operate in a mature neutron star .",
    "a neutron star becomes stably stratified almost immediately ( after 100s or so ) after birth and , even though the composition will affect the dynamics , the various oscillation modes are expected to be convectively stable .",
    "this conclusion appears to be challenged by recent work @xcite that suggests that the presence of superfluidity in the neutron star core may lead to local regions becoming convectively unstable . at first sight , this result is surprising , so it seems important to establish ( first of all ) whether it is correct .",
    "if the presence of superfluidity can , indeed , trigger a convection phase then we will need to understand the implications this may have for ( say ) the star s thermal evolution and other observable phenomena . the present investigation aims to address the first of these questions .",
    "we consider the local dynamics of a realistic ( outer ) neutron star core , focussing on the buoyancy experienced by fluid elements and the associated gravity g - modes .",
    "our model accounts for the presence of neutrons , protons , electrons and muons , and we include finite temperature effects by introducing an entropy component . however , we assume that the dynamics we are considering are sufficiently fast that thermal conductivity can be ignored .",
    "in essence , this means that i ) we can decouple the slow evolution associated with cooling , and ii ) if we allow the neutrons to becomes superfluid then the entropy is locked to any normal fluid in the mixture . since the protons are expected to form a superconductor ( we neglect all electromagnetic aspects here ) in the regions we are considering , the entropy will be carried by the electrons / muons .",
    "once we have developed the detailed framework for analysing the local ( plane - wave ) dynamics of this model , we provide detailed results that combine an actual cooling simulation with our derived dispersion relation .",
    "this should allow us to establish whether it is realistic to expect that convectively unstable regions may , indeed , exist at some point of a neutron star s early life .",
    "the motivation for this work is to understand i ) the effect that the interior composition has on the local dynamics of the fluid in the star , and ii ) how the onset of superfluidity impacts on the results .",
    "however , there are a number of crucial technical aspects to the analysis .",
    "our discussion highlights the microphysics information that is required to study this problem in particular , and model detailed neutron star dynamics in general .",
    "the implementation of this information may be somewhat technical ( and hence it is mainly discussed in appendices ) , but it is important to understand to what extent available neutron - star equation of state models provide the required information .    throughout the discussion , we work in a coordinate basis , expressing vector quantities in terms of their components .",
    "we denote space - time indices by lowercase italics starting from the beginning of the alphabet , @xmath0 .",
    "spatial indices are also lowercase italics , but start from @xmath1 . in both cases the einstein summation convention is assumed .",
    "the signature of the metric @xmath2 is @xmath3 $ ] , and the covariant derivative associated with this metric is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "different fluid components are distinguished by means of a constituent index ; a roman letter @xmath5 . specifically , we use @xmath6 for neutrons , @xmath7 of protons , @xmath8 for electrons , @xmath9 for muons and @xmath10 for entropy .",
    "these matter indices are not summed over when repeated .",
    "as we want to allow for the presence of superfluid components , it makes sense to build our model within the general framework for relativistic multi - fluid systems ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "this means that we take as our starting point the convective variational approach to relativistic fluids in which the key variables are the various fluxes @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a label that identifies the fluid ( in the following it will be n , p , e , @xmath9 or s ) . in general , these fluxes do not have to be conserved , and we would have @xmath13 where @xmath14 follows from the relevant reaction rates .",
    "the problem simplifies in two extreme limits . in the first limit ,",
    "the reactions are much faster than the dynamics .",
    "this means that a moving fluid element has time to equilibrate to its surroundings and hence its composition changes accordingly during the motion . in the opposite limit , when reactions are slow , the fluid element retains its chemical identity . in this latter case ,",
    "the mismatch between the composition of the fluid element and the neighbourhood leads to buoyancy .",
    "this can either serve to push the fluid element back in the direction it came from , which leads to a stable oscillation , or push it on in the direction of travel , which leads to an instability and large - scale convection .",
    "we will assume that we are working in the slow - reaction limit , and so ignore the @xmath14 and take the individual fluxes to be conserved .    in the text - book approach to relativistic",
    "fluid dynamics one assumes that friction locks the different species in the fluid together , and as a result they move with a common four - velocity @xmath15 .",
    "however , in a maturing neutron star the neutrons will become superfluid .",
    "this means that they will not experience friction ( at least not in the usual sense ) and hence they can drift relative to the other components . in principle , the same is true for the protons , which will become superconducting .",
    "however , in order to simplify the problem one may assume that the charged components are locked electromagnetically , forming a charge - neutral conglomerate .",
    "in essence , this means that we ignore the electromagnetic field ( as there will be no charge currents ) .",
    "this assumption may not be fully justified ( as neutron stars have magnetic fields and so must support charge currents ) , but we will nevertheless make it as it keeps the problem tractable .    assuming that protons , electron , muons and entropy co - move while neutrons are superfluid , we have @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the relative velocity of the neutrons ( @xmath19 ) . here and in the following",
    "we assume that this relative velocity is small enough that we can ignore red - shift factors in these expressions ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "this should be true for all situations of astrophysical interest .",
    "the number densities @xmath21 are then ( effectively ) all determined by the same observer . above the superfluid transition , the neutrons are obviously locked to the other components .",
    "the momenta that are conjugate to the particle fluxes follow from an energy @xmath22 ( which in turn is determined by the equation of state ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath23 in general , this allows for the presence of entrainment ; an effect that describes how one fluid is dragged along as another fluid moves . in a neutron star core , the protons and neutrons will be entrained due to the strong interaction .",
    "later , we will demonstrate that the multi - fluid formalism accounts for this effect in a very intuitive way .",
    "however , in order to keep the initial analysis tractable , we will not account for the entrainment at this point .",
    "this means that we have the momenta @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the respective chemical potentials and it is worth noting that the temperature is @xmath26 .",
    "we also have , when the neutrons are superfluid , @xmath27    in the absence of mechanisms coupling the components , the equations of motion for this system are represented by the conservation laws ( although with @xmath28 ) and the individual momentum equations ; @xmath29 } = 0 \\ , \\ ] ] where the square brackets denote anti - symmetrisation",
    ". however , when some mechanism couples various components one has to account for the relevant force ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "alternatively , one can appeal to newton s third law and work with relevant combinations of the equations ( such that the equal and opposite coupling forces cancel ) . in the problem we consider here , the upshot of this is that it is natural to work with the total momentum equation ( obtained by adding all the component equations ) and the momentum equation for the superfluid neutrons ( where we ignore coupling mechanisms like the vortex mediated mutual friction @xcite ) .",
    "the first of these equations contains the same information as the divergence of the stress - energy tensor .    above the superfluid transition temperature one might as well work with @xmath31 where @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the pressure and @xmath34 is the energy density . in equilibrium ,",
    "the equation of state for matter is given by a barotrope @xmath35 , but as soon as we account for perturbations we need to account for the detailed composition .",
    "this is an important point , which we will return to later .    below the superfluid transition",
    ", we can still use the sum of the momentum equations ( although it will take a slightly different form as there will now be explicit terms of order @xmath18 ) . in order to describe the new degree of freedom associated with the superfluid neutrons we complement this system by @xmath36 .",
    "we also have a set of thermodynamical identities .",
    "as we are neglecting terms of second order in @xmath37 , the energy density and pressure obey the usual gibbs relation ( the integrated first law of thermodynamics ) @xmath38 from thermodynamics principles ( cf .",
    "the definition of the conjugate momenta and the chemical potentials ) we have @xmath39 which means that @xmath40 these relations lay the foundation for our analysis .",
    "let us now turn to the problem of building a relativistic star .",
    "we want to consider the perturbations of a non - rotating star in dynamical and thermodynamical equilibrium ( at least on the timescale of the dynamics we are considering ) .",
    "that is , our background model is a spherical star in which all fluids co - move ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "considering the general metric for a spherical star ( taken to be fixed later , meaning that we work in the cowling approximation ) ; @xmath42 it is easy to see that the background 4-velocity and the conjugate momenta are : @xmath43 meanwhile , the total pressure is obtained from @xmath44 here , and in the following , primes denotes radial derivatives .",
    "we have also introduced the gravitational acceleration , @xmath45 , for later convenience . combined with the definition of @xmath46 in terms of the mass enclosed within radius @xmath47 ; @xmath48 and @xmath49 these are the familiar tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations . for later convenience ,",
    "it is also worth noting that the einstein equations lead to @xmath50    finally , if the neutrons are superfluid , then we also have @xcite @xmath51          in order to complete the background model and discuss the internal composition of a given star , we obviously need to provide an equation of state . in principle , we can assume that this is given in terms of an energy ( density ) @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the total baryon number density and @xmath54 are the various species fractions .",
    "once we have this relation , we can readily work out the pressure from .",
    "there are numerous proposed `` realistic '' equations of state available in the literature , so one might think we would be spoilt for choice . unfortunately ( or perhaps fortunately ? )",
    "this is not the case .",
    "the problem is that most tabulated equations of state do not provide all the information we need in order to study neutron star oscillations .",
    "basically , the tabulated data often assumes that the matter is in equilibrium , whereas we need to be able to track how the matter responds when driven out of equilibrium by the fluid motion .",
    "the equilibrium configuration must satisfy three conditions ; @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57 but the perturbations may be such that a moving fluid element violates one or more of these conditions .",
    "in fact , it is precisely this mismatch that leads to the buoyancy that gives rise to the presence of g - modes . in other words ,",
    "we need to get the physics input from a general energy functional that allows us to model matter out of equilibrium . for practical reasons",
    ", it would be advantageous if the equation of state was given in a parameterised analytic form rather than as a numerical table",
    ". we will need to work out various partial derivatives and it would be an extremely tricky exercise to do this in a thermodynamically consistent way starting from tabulated data ( this should be clear from the discussion in appendix a ) .",
    "for these reasons , we base our analysis on the family of equations of state provided by the brussels - montreal collaboration @xcite .",
    "even though we focus on one particular family of models , the parameter space is still overwhelming .",
    "hence , we will provide actual results only for a single stellar model .",
    "the star we consider is constructed from the bsk20 equation of state @xcite .",
    "a discussion of the general features of this equation of state model and stars built from it can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our particular stellar model has mass @xmath58 and radius @xmath59  km",
    ". this should be a fairly `` average '' neutron star .",
    "let us now consider the interior composition of this model . in principle , this problem must be solved numerically . however , in the spirit of the present study it would be preferable to have an analytic approximation .",
    "fortunately , such an approximation is readily obtained if we note that the symmetry energy @xmath60 ( which represents the energy cost in replacing protons with neutrons in symmetric nuclear matter ) satisfies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the reduced planck s constant and @xmath63 is the speed of light ( which is taken to be unity throughout most of the discussion of dynamics , but reinstated in parts of the discussion of the equation of state input ) , and we assume that the electrons are sufficiently relativistic that we can neglect their rest mass .",
    "this is a good approximation for a neutron star core ( and most of the crust ) . for a typical neutron star ,",
    "the outer layers of the core only contains neutrons , protons and electrons .",
    "then we can use the condition for charge neutrality to replace @xmath64 with @xmath65 on the right - hand side of the equation .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath66^{-1}\\ , \\label{xeapp}\\ ] ] once the muons appear , the problem becomes a little bit more involved , but in reality remains quite accurate ( basically since the fraction of charged particles is small ) .",
    "this means that we can solve for the muon fraction . to do this ,",
    "we need @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the fermi wavenumber for the muons .",
    "thus we arrive at @xmath69^{3/2}\\ .\\ ] ] finally , the proton fraction follows from @xmath70 . as an illustration , the resulting fractions for the bsk20 model",
    "are shown in the left panel of figure  [ fractions ] .",
    "these results agree well with the parameterised expressions given by @xcite , which are based on the numerical solution to the problem .",
    "our approximate fractions are accurate enough for our purposes .",
    "the right - hand panel of figure  [ fractions ] shows the composition of our model star , indicating the crust - core transition ( @xmath71  km here ) as well as the radius at which the muons first appear ( @xmath72  km in our case ) .",
    "the buoyancy of a local fluid element depends not only on the matter composition , it can also be affected by thermal gradients . in order to account for this aspect , which should be important during the early stages of a neutron star s life , we carry out a detailed cooling simulation for our model star .",
    "the temperature evolution of an isolated neutron star is determined by the relativistic equations of energy balance and heat flux .",
    "we solve this system using the method described in @xcite .",
    "the physics inputs for these equations are the heat capacity , emissivity of neutrinos ( which is the primary cooling process at ages @xmath73 ) , and thermal conductivity .",
    "the heat capacity is the sum of contributions from the constituent particles , also given in @xcite .",
    "various neutrino emission processes contribute to the total emissivity , with the primary processes being the modified urca mechanism and cooper pair formation and breaking ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* , and references therein ) ; the bsk20 eos does not produce neutron stars that undergo neutrino emission via the direct urca mechanism .",
    "thermal conductivities in the core are calculated using results from references given in @xcite , while those in the crust are calculated using conduct13 .",
    "note that , due to high thermal conductivity the crust and the core are roughly isothermal after @xmath74 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cooling ] ) , although there are still slight variations at later times due to the superfluidity .",
    "two other important factors affecting neutron star cooling behaviour are the composition of the outer layers ( envelope ) of the neutron star crust and whether the stellar interior is superfluid and/or superconducting . for the former , the envelope serves as a heat blanket , with envelopes composed of light elements conducting heat more efficiently than heavy element envelopes . for simplicity ,",
    "we only consider neutron stars with an iron envelope .",
    "for the second factor , superfluidity and superconductivity suppress heat capacities and some neutrino emission mechanisms , as well as enhancing neutrino emission through the cooper pairing process .    the initial temperature for our evolutions is taken to be a constant @xmath75 .",
    "figure  [ fig : cooling ] shows the time evolution of temperature at different ages of our model star .",
    "also shown are the critical temperatures for the onset of neutron superfluidity in the singlet state in the crust and triplet state in the core and proton superconductivity in the core .",
    "specifically , we use the neutron singlet model from @xcite , the neutron triplet model is taken from @xcite , and we use the proton superconductivity model from @xcite .",
    "critical temperatures are calculated using parametrised gap models following the prescription from @xcite .",
    "note that , as we do not yet have self - consistent calculations of the relevant pairing gaps for neutrons and protons for the bsk equations of state ( or , indeed , any other proposed equation of state ) , we are `` forced '' to use this phenomenological prescription .",
    "note that , in the following we do not distinguish between singlet and triplet pairing for the neutron superfluid .",
    "in essence , we take the critical temperature to be @xmath76 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath77 throughout the core ( as in figure  [ fig : cooling ] ) .",
    "our results show that , at very early times , the core cools more rapidly than the crust via stronger neutrino emission , so that the crust is generally at higher temperatures .",
    "a cooling wave travels from the core to the surface , eventually bringing the neutron star to a relaxed , isothermal state .",
    "we also see the effect of superfluidity , i.e. , faster cooling after neutrons become superfluid in the crust at early times and in the core at later times .",
    "these effects are strongest in regions near the critical temperatures , in accordance with the expectations from previous work .          given the results of the recent analysis by @xcite and the suggestion that thermal effects may lead to convective regions in a cooling neutron star , we need to be able to consider both superfluidity and thermal effects .",
    "a key feature of this problem is that the leptons ( electrons and muons ) are the main carriers of entropy in a superfluid neutron star core .",
    "as long as the local temperature is far below the critical temperature for the onset of superfluidity , it is safe to ignore the presence of thermal excitations in the superfluid .",
    "however , these excitations play an important role near the transition .",
    "in essence , there may always be a local region ( near the critical density for the given temperature ) where excitations must be accounted for . as discussed by @xcite , this effect can be quantified in terms of entrainment between the superfluid and the normal component ( entropy ) . in practice",
    ", this leads to the superfluid component locking to the normal component at the transition . a key question concerns to what extent the superfluid transition is local .",
    "if it is , then one may be able to avoid a detailed analysis and simply impose suitable junction conditions .",
    "if , on the other hand , the interface is extended over a macroscopic region , then any study of neutron star dynamics will have to account for the detailed transition .",
    "as we will account for the presence of thermal excitations , our analysis should shed some light on this issue .",
    "our aim is to combine the results of the cooling simulations with a local analysis of the fluid dynamics .",
    "when it comes to the inclusion of thermal effects , the discussion involves approximations and it is useful to explain what they are .",
    "first of all , the cooling simulation is carried out for a stellar model with fixed size , internal composition and so on , by solving the heat equation on top of a passive stellar configuration .",
    "this approach is standard and should be adequate as long as one can neglect the effects of thermal pressure compared to the cold degeneracy pressure .",
    "as our cooling simulation starts at a temperature of @xmath78  k  @xmath791  mev and the typical chemical potentials are of order 100  mev , this approximation should be safe .",
    "the errors involved are certainly smaller than our level of ignorance regarding the supranuclear physics .",
    "when it comes to quantifying the thermal effects , it is useful to consider the following argument : the total pressure has to satisfy @xmath80 where we assume that the star is composed of neutrons , protons , electrons and muons ( as before ) and the entropy density is given by @xmath81 . in a region where the neutrons are superfluid , they must satisfy .",
    "if we also impose the equilibrium conditions ( balance between electrons and muons and charge neutrality ) we are left with a relation that can be written ; @xmath82 = - s { d\\over dr } \\left(t e^\\phi \\right ) = - s { dt^\\infty \\over dr } \\ .\\ ] ] combining this with we arrive at @xmath83 =   - { s\\over n_{\\mathrm p } } { dt^\\infty \\over dr } \\ .\\ ] ] this relation ( also given by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) tells us that a model that satisfies the various chemical equilibrium conditions must also be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "that is , we must have @xmath84  constant .",
    "this is , of course , not going to be true during the early cooling phase , see figure  [ fig : cooling ] . in order to make the model consistent",
    "we would need to add the thermal contributions to the relevant chemical potentials .",
    "this would then lead to a gradual evolution of the star s composition during the cooling ; essentially the tail - end of the de - leptonisation that dominates the first 100  s or so of the star s life @xcite .",
    "however , as this effect is very small during the phase that we are considering it should be safe to neglect it .    in quantifying the fluid dynamics we do , however , want to account for thermal effects .",
    "we do this by considering the equation of state as a zero - temperature model with thermal contributions added perturbatively . assuming that only the electrons and muons contribute and treating each as a relativistic fermi gas @xcite , we have @xmath85 where @xmath86 and the relevant fermi temperature is given by @xmath87 ( note that , for simplicity , we are ignoring the muon mass here ) .",
    "`` integrating '' the definition of the temperature ( as the entropy chemical potential ) ; @xmath88 we see that the thermal energy is @xmath89 and the thermal pressure , which follows from the integrated first law , is @xmath90 this contribution tends to be ( very ) small compared to the cold degeneracy pressure , so we only include it whenever it plays a leading role in the analysis .    in the case of a superfluid neutron star core , we will work with @xmath91 ( cf .",
    "equation  ) . for this variable ,",

    "in order to establish our approach to the problem , and provide useful results for comparison , let us begin our analysis by revisiting the standard g - mode problem @xcite , ignoring superfluidity and thermal effects .",
    "that is , we consider a stratified star where all fluid constituents move together , in such a way that there is only one fluid four velocity to worry about . in this case",

    "looking ahead to the problem of main interest , that of a superfluid neutron star core , we assume that the star is composed of a mixture of neutrons , protons , electrons and muons .",
    "our aim is to establish how variations in composition leads to buoyancy and the emergence of a set of g - modes .",
    "we assume that the dynamics is fast enough that the composition of each fluid element can be considered frozen .",
    "this is equivalent to stating that the lagrangian variation ( @xmath96 ) of the particle fractions @xmath97 vanish \\ .\\ ] ] whatever the fluid motion is , the metric variation @xmath98 is the same for all components .",
    "if two components are locked , in the sense that their displacements are the same , it is easy to show that the lagrangian perturbation of the ratio of the two number densities must vanish . ] .",
    "this means that we have @xmath99 where @xmath100 denotes eulerian perturbations and @xmath101 is the lagrangian displacement vector .",
    "in the case we are considering ( a static background star ) we have @xmath102 where @xmath103 represents the lie derivative along the background four velocity .    in order to study the dynamics of the star , we assume a harmonic time - dependence @xmath104 and use the standard ( polar ) decomposition of the displacement vector in terms of spherical harmonics @xmath105 .",
    "we then have ( suppressing sums over @xmath106 and @xmath107 , since the different multipoles decouple for a spherical background star ) @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are functions of @xmath47 .",
    "scalar quantities , like the perturbed pressure , are also expanded in spherical harmonics , which means that we have @xmath111 etcetera . in the following ,",
    "hats are frequently used to denote amplitudes of perturbed quantities .",
    "these variables are functions of @xmath47 only .    in order to make progress on the problem",
    ", we need to decide which variables to work with . in this first example , we will choose to work with the perturbed pressure , @xmath112 , and the radial component of the displacement vector , @xmath109 .",
    "this means that we need to obtain relations for the perturbed number density , @xmath113 , and the perturbed energy density , @xmath114 , from the equation of state . as we are assuming that the composition of each fluid element is frozen on the timescale of the motion , it is natural to consider the equation of state as a function , rather than baryon number density , @xmath115 , as one of the primary variables",
    "this is not necessarily the most practical choice , but it facilitates a direct comparison with the work of @xcite and @xcite ] @xmath116 .",
    "moreover , it is convenient to work with the enthalpy , @xmath117 .",

    ", we have carefully checked the various temperature distributions extracted from our cooling simulation . from this data",
    "we have found one single case where an instability is present .",
    "this case is illustrated in figure  [ instab ] .",
    "we see that the instability is weak ( @xmath260 only becomes marginally negative ) and strongly localised , meaning that only very short wavelength motion would actually be unstable .",
    "the instability is present after about a day of thermal evolution ( which is long enough that the artificial isothermal initial temperature distribution has filtered through the system , as this happens on a timescale of seconds ) , but it is gone well before the system is one year old .",
    "this seems to suggest that this convective instability is unlikely to play much of a role in the evolution of a neutron star .",
    "having said that , it is conceptually interesting and one should keep in mind that we have only considered one particular model .      if we want to account for the relevant physics of a neutron star core , it is imperative that we include the entrainment effect in our model .",
    "entrainment is known to play an important role in superfluid dynamics @xcite .",
    "this is natural as it encodes how easy ( or hard ) it is for a superfluid component to move relative to the other parts of the system .",
    "it is a non - dissipative effect , which essentially represents the effective mass of the superfluid component .",
    "there are two , formally different but de facto equivalent , ways of incorporating the entrainment .",
    "the first approach encodes the effect in a mass - density matrix @xmath263 which designates how much one component tends to flow along with the other(s ) @xcite .",
    "an alternative , which is more natural from the relativistic point - of - view @xcite , is to account for the effect through the momentum of each component . in this approach",
    ", the entrainment leads to the momentum of a given component @xmath264 no longer being proportional to the corresponding flow @xmath11 , but rather a linear combination of all the flows that are entrained .         under the conditions that prevail in a cold neutron star core , the main cause of entrainment is the strong interaction . as a superfluid",
    "neutron moves , a virtual cloud of entrained protons tries to move with it ( and vice versa ) .",
    "the effect does not depend ( at least not much ) on the temperature . in the following we quantify this strong interaction entrainment by a coefficient @xmath265 . in a finite - temperature superfluid",
    ", one also has to account for the presence of thermal excitations . as argued by @xcite , the dynamical role of the excitations",
    "can be accounted for in terms of entrainment between the superfluid and the heat @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we represent this effect by a coefficient @xmath266 .",
    "the upshot is that the momentum of the superfluid neutrons in our mixture is given by ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed discussion ) @xmath267 where the three coefficients @xmath268 , @xmath269 and @xmath270 follow from the equation of state .",
    "it is worth noting that we have assumed that the protons , electrons and muons all flow together . projecting the neutron momentum along the neutron flow",
    ", we see that the corresponding chemical potential is given by @xmath271 this expression is the key to adding the entrainment to our previous analysis of the g - mode problem .",
    "this extension turns out to be surprisingly straightforward . after consulting the discussion from the previous section ,",
    "we simply introduce a new parameter @xmath272 as discussed in appendix  b , there are two key limits to consider .",
    "first of all , in the limit of zero entrainment we have @xmath273 .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath274 will diverge as @xmath275 , as we approach the critical density for onset of neutron superfluidity ( see appendix  b , especially eq .  ) .",
    "the analysis leading to the dispersion relation now proceeds along the same steps as in the case without entrainment .",
    "we only have to account for the fact that the momenta are linear combinations of the two fluxes and ( carefully ) redefine some of the quantities involved .",
    "we will also need slightly different combinations of the various thermodynamical derivatives .",
    "the logic of the analysis is , however , the same as before .",
    "hence , we relegate the details to appendix  b and focus on the results here .",
    "the main question is how the entrainment impacts on the local wave propagation .",
    "let us first consider the sound waves . in the high - frequency limit , we find that the dispersion relation reduces to @xmath276 where @xmath277 and @xmath278 in these expressions , @xmath247 takes the same form as in , but we now have @xmath279 meanwhile , @xmath280        in general , we have the two anticipated sets of sound waves .",
    "however , the situation changes as we approach the critical temperature for the onset of superfluidity . in this limit",
    ", we have @xmath281 and @xmath282 this means that @xmath283 and @xmath284 we learn that one set of sound waves disappears as we cross the superfluid transition .",
    "this is , of course , as expected .",
    "the `` second sound '' is not supported in normal matter . as far as we are aware , this is the first time that this limit has been demonstrated explicitly . in particular , our analysis highlights the key role that the thermal entrainment plays in the problem .",
    "a closer analysis of the remaining sound wave , represented by , shows that it is close to , but not identical to , the normal sound ( @xmath285 is not identical to @xmath286 ) .",
    "the typical difference is at the few percent level , depending on where the superfluid transition takes place in the core . in other words ,",
    "a small discontinuity remains in the local sound - wave frequency as we cross the critical density between superfluid and normal regions .",
    "turning to the low - frequency regime , we find that leads to the presence of g - modes with frequency @xmath287 where @xmath288 which leads to , as we approach the superfluid transition ; @xmath289 as in the case of the sound waves , this result does not limit to the normal - fluid g - mode frequency at the superfluid transition .",
    "in fact , the discontinuity in this case is significant .",
    "the superfluid results starts out significantly below the normal - fluid g - mode frequency at the superfluid transition temperature ( which accords with the results of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and then rises towards the cold superfluid result as the star ages . making use of our cooling data , we obtain the results shown in figure  [ entrain ] .",
    "this figure illustrates the effect that thermal excitations ( accounted for through the entrainment between superfluid and entropy ) has on the transition between different layers in the star .",
    "note that we have not included the entrainment due to the strong interaction as is it essentially temperature independent ( and it is a small effect ) .",
    "this demonstration shows that it is important to account for the thermal effects when considering the dynamics of superfluid neutron stars , and emphasises the need for more detailed modelling building on , for example , @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the local dynamics of a realistic neutron star core , accounting for composition gradients , superfluidity and thermal effects .",
    "our main focus was on the gravity g - modes , which are supported by composition stratification and thermal gradients , but we also provided results relevant for the sound waves of the system .",
    "we have derived the detailed equations that govern the problem , paying particular attention to how the physics that is encoded in the equation of state enters and distinguishing between normal and superfluid regions .",
    "the analysis highlighted a number of issues that need to be kept in mind whenever equation of state data is compiled from nuclear physics calculations for use in this kind of analysis .",
    "we provided explicit results for a particular stellar model and a specific equation of state ( bsk20 from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , making use of accurate cooling simulations to show how the local wave spectrum evolves as the star ages from adolescence to maturity .",
    "our results confirm the expectation that the composition gradient is dominated by the muons beyond the density at which they first appear @xcite . at lower densities , where there are no muons",
    ", the support for the g - modes is entirely thermal once the star cools below the superfluid transition .",
    "we confirm the recent suggestion that the g - modes in this region may be unstable @xcite , but our results indicate that this instability will be weak and would only be present for a short period of the star s life ( less than a year ) .",
    "a novel technical aspect of our analysis is associated with the thermal excitations at finite temperatures which are accounted for in terms of entrainment between the entropy and the superfluid component .",
    "once the thermal entrainment is accounted for we see that the oscillation spectrum may still be evolving even for rather mature stars . finally , we discussed the difference between the normal sound waves and the second sound that is present only in the superfluid regions .",
    "this work extends the state - of - the - art in several ways .",
    "most importantly , we have shown how detailed equations of state data can be implemented to study neutron star dynamics at a serious level of realism .",
    "this poses two main challenges for the future .",
    "first of all , we need to build on this work to construct global models for dynamical neutron stars , as required for detailed asteroseismology studies .",
    "secondly , we need a continued dialogue with nuclear physics experts both to expand the set of equation of state models that provide all the information required for this kind of study , and also to complete the models we have used in this work ( e.g. concerning consistent superfluid pairing gaps ) .",

    "is supported by the stfc in the uk .",
    "let us now take a closer look at how we evaluate the different thermodynamical partial derivatives we need .",
    "this issue is not trivial as our perturbative analysis made use of variables that require a somewhat unusual description of the equation of state .",
    "basically , it is important to keep track of what is being held fixed when the various adiabatic indices are evaluated . as a first step , which takes us a bit closer to where we need to be , let us assume that the equation of state is given in terms of the variables @xmath53 , @xmath291 , @xmath195 and @xmath91 . as our main interest is in the g - modes , let us focus on the quantities we need to determine them .",

    "this means assuming that @xmath200 is held fixed , so we take @xmath293 in the following .",
    "we want to work out @xmath294 as this involves holding the pressure constant , we use the definition of the pressure to get @xmath295 where @xmath296 ( here and in the following we need to keep in mind that the other variables are to be held fixed when the partial derivatives are evaluated ) and @xmath297 the last equality follows since @xmath115 and @xmath65 are held fixed , which means that @xmath298 .",
    "next , the requirement that @xmath194 is constant leads to the relation @xmath299 where @xmath300^{-1 } \\left [ a_2 - \\left({\\partial \\mu_{\\mathrm n}\\over \\partial n}\\right)^{-1 } \\left({\\partial \\mu_{\\mathrm n}\\over \\partial m}\\right ) \\right ] \\ .\\ ] ] by combining these results , we arrive at the expression we need @xmath301      turning to the thermal contribution , we instead hold @xmath201 fixed and work out @xmath302 for obvious reasons , the results are similar to those for the muons . holding the pressure fixed leads to @xmath303 where @xmath304 ( the only difference from the previous case is that @xmath201 is held fixed rather than @xmath200 ) and @xmath305 next , keeping @xmath194 fixed leads to the relation @xmath306 where @xmath307^{-1 } \\left [ b_2 - \\left({\\partial \\mu_{\\mathrm n}\\over \\partial n}\\right)^{-1 } \\left({\\partial \\mu_{\\mathrm n}\\over \\partial s}\\right ) \\right ] \\ .\\ ] ] by combining these results , we arrive at @xmath308    in the model we consider in this paper , the thermal contributions are added perturbatively to a cold background star .",
    "moreover , it tends to be the case that the thermal effects can be neglected compared to the cold parameters .",
    "for example , for the range of temperatures we consider , the thermal pressure can always be neglected compared to the cold degeneracy pressure throughout the star s core . for our model ,",

    "<S> when the star cools below the superfluid transition , the support for g - modes at lower densities ( where there are no muons ) is entirely thermal . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the recent suggestion that the g - modes in this region may be unstable , but our results indicate that this instability will be weak and would only be present for a brief period of the star s life . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis accounts for the presence of thermal excitations encoded in entrainment between the entropy and the superfluid component . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the complete spectrum , including the normal sound waves and , in superfluid regions , the second sound .    </S>",
