    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern will soon provide a great opportunity for exploring physics at the tev scale . as a proton - proton collider with a total center - of - mass energy of 14 tev ,",
    "the lhc is truly a quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) machine .",
    "we therefore wish to study color exotics , since any accessible new physics in the strong interaction sector will appear in the early stages of lhc operation .",
    "many models of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) naturally require the presence of color exotics , such as gluinos and squarks in supersymmetric extensions of standard model , @xmath9-gluons and @xmath9-quarks in extra dimensional models , or the top - prime in little higgs or twin higgs models .",
    "all of these are either quark or gluon partners which belong to the fundamental and adjoint representations of the qcd gauge group @xmath10 respectively .",
    "it is natural to consider colored particles in other representations ; in this paper , we focus on a scalar which is in the sextet(6 ) representation of @xmath10 .",
    "color sextet particles have been widely discussed in nuclear physics as diquark condensate states ; in the ssc era , sextet quarks were discussed in @xcite .",
    "color sextet scalars are naturally present in partial unification @xcite , grand unification @xcite and composite models ; in some cases they may be present around the weak scale .",
    "for instance , in a supersymmetric pati - salam @xmath11 model , light color sextet scalars can be realized around the weak scale , even though the scale of @xmath12 symmetry breaking is around @xmath13 gev due to existence of accidental symmetries with the masses of color sextet higgs arising only through high dimension operators @xcite . in this case",
    ", the introduction of a color sextet higgs will not lead to proton decay but only to neutron - anti - neutron ( @xmath14 ) oscillation and is fully compatible with present limits @xcite . in a similar framework , light color sextet scalars also help in post - sphaleron baryogenesis @xcite . in this paper , however , we will take a purely phenomenological approach toward the sextet scalar without assuming any model a priori .    among all the color exotics , the color sextet scalar is unique in its coupling to quarks .",
    "in group theory language , the color sextet lies in @xmath15 as a symmetric @xmath16 rank tensor under @xmath10 . the lorentz structure for this scalar coupling to quarks",
    "is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a dirac spinor and @xmath19 is the scalar . under the sm gauge group @xmath20 , the sextet scalar can be @xmath21 , a @xmath22 adjoint @xmath23 ; @xmath24 , a @xmath22 singlet @xmath25 ; @xmath26 , a @xmath22 singlet @xmath27 ; or @xmath28 , a @xmath22 singlet @xmath29 .",
    "the color sextet scalars are also charged under the global baryon symmetry @xmath30 and the electromagnetic symmetry @xmath31 . to avoid breaking @xmath31 , these scalar fields should not develop a non - zero vacuum expectation value .",

    "we expect at least one of the couplings , @xmath52 or @xmath53 , to be negligible .",
    "however from our purely phenomenological perspective , we take the decay branching fraction @xmath54 to be a completely free parameter whose value may be determined at the lhc .    because the sextet is a colored object , we need to consider the possibility of it hadronizing before decaying .",
    "for example , it may form a tetraquark - like bound state with @xmath55 , such as @xmath56 , @xmath57 , or @xmath58 , with charges @xmath59 respectively .",

    "thus we may also have single production of a @xmath24 through uu ( cc)_6 .",
    "however , the production cross section is proportional to the coupling @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and may therefore be suppressed due to the @xmath46 mixing constraint .",
    "some studies of the single @xmath24 production at the tevatron and the lhc have been done in ref .",
    "as discussed in the previous sections , the most distinct feature of the color sextet scalar is its decay mode @xmath87 , which leads to a same - sign dilepton signature in the final state if both top quarks decay semileptonically , i.e. @xmath88 . to avoid ambiguities in lepton assignments during reconstruction , we require the anti - top quark pair from the @xmath89 to decay hadronically .",

    "we next consider the backgrounds for our signal .",
    "we require at least 2 tagged b - jets plus a same - sign dilepton and multijet .",

    "no reconstruction selection has been implented since we did not simulate the events with initial state / final state radiation and the reconstruction efficiency is thus unknown . in principle , we expect that the @xmath132 can be further improved by including reconstruction .     and significance contour .",
