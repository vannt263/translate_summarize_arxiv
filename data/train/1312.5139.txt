    "the non - polynomial scaling of the healing length @xmath17 where @xmath18 , is captured by stating that the spatial critical exponent @xmath19 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this is a brief and dramatic way to sum up the faster than polynomial divergence of @xmath20 , but it may tempt one to misuse eqs .",
    "( [ hatepsilon],[hatxi ] ) .",
    "thus , formally , one could insert @xmath19 relevant for the kt universality class into eq .",
    "( [ hatxi ] ) to obtain : @xmath21 this equation may be ( as we shall see below ) asymptotically valid , but is unlikely to have the same range of validity as eqs .",
    "( [ hatepsilon],[hatxi ] ) regarded as the consequence of eq .",
    "( [ kzeq ] ) .",
    "in particular , for large @xmath0 the exponent @xmath22 approaches @xmath23 , reflected in eq .",
    "( [ hatxinaive ] ) , only gradually .    to see why , consider the equation for the relaxation time @xmath24 in the kt universality class : @xmath25 and assume , as before , @xmath26 .",
    "equations ( [ kzeq ] ) and ( [ taukt ] ) yield @xmath27 thus , @xmath1 is now a solution of a transcendental equation .",
    "it can be obtained as @xmath28}\\right)^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the lambert function .",
    "the above solution is plotted for different values of @xmath30 in fig .",
    "[ fig : hatt]a , b .",
    "this relation has been derived before and tested by numerical simulations in a 2d classical model in ref .",
    "@xcite .    figure [ fig : hatt]c shows that the slope of unity for the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath0 ( and , therefore , @xmath16 on @xmath31 ) is attained only for @xmath0 many orders of magnitude larger than @xmath13  for exceedingly slow quenches that are unlikely to be experimentally accessible .",
    "for even reasonably slow quenches the effective power law would be significantly less than @xmath32 , typically as small as @xmath33 for @xmath34 , gradually increasing to @xmath35 as @xmath36 grows to @xmath37 or so .",
    "therefore , in transitions that exhibit kt - like non - polynomial scalings and result in symmetry breaking the asymptotic behavior one might have inferred from the critical exponents sets in only in the regime that appears to be out of reach of experiments . for instance , the system would have to be large compared to the @xmath38 , which means ( when we take modest @xmath39 m ) that the size of the homogeneous system undergoing the transition should be large compared to @xmath40 , say @xmath41 , or , in other words , kilometers !        a similar difference between the critical limit and the critical regime , although with less dramatic consequences , arises near the para - to - ferro transition in the random ising chain @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are randomly chosen ferromagnetic couplings and transverse magnetic fields respectively . here in turn",
    "@xmath45 is a solid number and it is the dynamical exponent that diverges in the critical regime @xcite : @xmath46 the limit @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , implies @xmath49 , i.e. , a correlation length that does not depend on the quench time at all .",
    "however , a more careful analysis of the equation ( [ kzeq ] ) , employing the full formula ( [ zrandom ] ) instead of just its critical limit , leads to a prediction that there is actually a slow logarithmic dependence on @xmath0 , a conclusion that was confirmed by simulations in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a similar care proves beneficial for a non - linear quench @xmath50 first considered e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "@xmath51 is the sign function and @xmath52 is an exponent . equation ( [ kzeq ] ) yields @xmath53 and the characteristic scale of length @xmath54 again , this simple but careful argument leads to the same conclusion as the calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite .    * kibble - zurek mechanism in the bose - hubbard model . *",
    "we emphasize that kt scaling is encountered in systems other than the classic kt transition in two dimensions ( in which generation of vortex pairs occurs via thermal activation as the system is heated ) . thus , while for the sake of definiteness , the discussion above was in the framework of finite temperature phase transitions , the universal character of the arguments makes the conclusions applicable also to quantum phase transitions in the ground state at zero temperature .",
    "the most celebrated example of the quantum kt universality class with @xmath55 is the 1d bose - hubbard model @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a bosonic annihilation operator at site @xmath58 and @xmath59 is an occupation number operator . at a commensurate",
    "filling of @xmath32 particle per site , the ground state of the model undergoes a k - t quantum phase transition from a localized mott phase at @xmath60 to a superfluid phase at @xmath61 .",
    "the energy gap on the mott side of the transition is @xmath62 here @xmath63 is a dimensionless ratio of the hopping rate @xmath64 to the interaction strength @xmath65 . using ref .",
    "@xcite , it is possible to estimate : @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .    any quench from the mott to the superfluid phase can be linearized near the phase transition @xmath69 the evolution ceases to be adiabatic at @xmath70 when the reaction time @xmath71 of the system equals the time remaining to the transition @xmath72 : @xmath73 its solution is @xmath74 ^ 2},\\ ] ] where the characteristic timescale is @xmath75 this inverse gap is proportional to the correlation length frozen into the state of the system at @xmath76 : @xmath77 this correlation length is plotted in figure [ fig : xi ] .",
    "to summarize , the equation ( [ xikt ] ) applies in the critical regime where @xmath78 and not only in the limit @xmath47 .",
    "when the last limit is taken in , say , the bose - hubbard model , then the equation implies a steep power law @xmath79 , but a careful application of eq .",
    "( [ xikt ] ) in the whole critical regime shows that the steep power law is reached only for rather `` astronomical '' values of @xmath0 and , especially , of @xmath40 that can hardly be achieved in a realistic experiment . for more realistic quench times",
    "there is no power law , although in a narrow range of @xmath0 there may appear to be one but with a much reduced exponent .",
    "we have seen that , in some cases , using kzm requires more than just inserting critical exponents ( that are valid only asymptotically close to the critical point ) .",
    "rather , to estimate the scale @xmath40 one must make sure that the key idea behind kzm  critical slowing down as well as the resulting scaling of the sonic horizon  are accurately described by the critical exponents in the regime probed by the experiment .",
    "this may seem like a straightforward requirement , but , as we have seen , there are situations where it may not be easy to satisfy .",
    "the example with kosterlitz - thouless scaling we have just discussed may be extreme in that the scaling represented by the asymptotic values of critical exponents is attained only in the limit that is  fapp  unreachable in the laboratory .",
    "nevertheless , the kzm - like analysis based on the actual dependence of the gap on @xmath80 enables prediction of the scaling modified to suit the range of the experimentally implementable quench rates .",
    "key quantity for such considerations is @xmath81 , the point where the behavior of the system changes character , and the corresponding @xmath1 that defines the sonic horizon .",
    "however , even before one evaluates such subtleties exemplified by the kt transition , it is useful to verify the kzm prerequisite , i.e. , whether transition starts and ends sufficiently far from the critical point to justify appeal to kzm . in experiments that involve emulation of condensed matter systems using e.g. trapped ions , or bec s and optical lattices",
    "this may be far from straightforward , as experimental constraints may force relatively short quench timescales ( i.e. , modest values of @xmath36 ) which means that @xmath81 may be too large  sonic horizon may be defined too far from the critical point  to expect near - critical scalings to be relevant .",
    "similar remark applies to sizes of systems : unless sonic horizon @xmath82 is small compared to the size of the system , scalings predicted by homogeneous kzm will not apply ( although  given certain additional assumptions ",
    "one may be able to deduce their modified versions @xcite ) .",
    "a related and interesting issue is how does kzm fail when the assumptions are only approximately satisfied or even violated .",
    "experiments such as @xcite suggest that this might be a `` soft failure '' , i.e. , some features of kzm ( e.g. , power law dependences ) may still apply even while detailed predictions ( exponents of these power laws ) are unlikely to hold .",
    "there are also indications that even when the requirement of starting and ending the quench on the outside of the @xmath83 $ ] interval is satisfied only on one side , kzm like scaling may still emerge . while this is beyond the scope of the original kzm assumptions , it is clearly worthy of a more detailed investigation",
    ".    indeed ,",
    "the bose - hubbard model is `` gapless '' on the superfluid side , so in this sense only the @xmath84 on the mott insulator side is well defined .",
    "yet , recent experiment suggests that @xcite that power laws may approximate the post - quench state of the system , although ( at variance with kzm ) their slopes appear to depend on where the system starts and ends the quench . given that the investigated quench times were short ( @xmath85 ) , so that quenches likely started and/or ended inside the @xmath83 $ ] interval , this is no surprise .",
    "one further complication that is worth noting is that the `` original '' kzm was focused on predicting densities of topologically protected objects .",
    "more recent extensions use it to predict other properties of the system following continuous phase transitions .",
    "thus , the size of the sonic horizon has been used to estimate coherence length in the post - transition bose - hubbard superfluid .",
    "this is , again , an interesting extension , and there are settings ( e.g. , quantum ising ) where the numerical results ( e.g. , behavior of entanglement entropy @xcite ) has been observed .",
    "however , as one moves away from the stable and well defined topological defects in integrable systems to less well defined and less stable characteristics ( like coherence length in bose - hubbard systems that exhibit more complicated behavior ) , kzm may still yield useful `` guidelines '' , but regarding it as prediction without further justification requires courage .",
