    "x - shaped radio galaxies ( xrgs ) are double - lobed radio galaxies @xcite which also possess a pair of long , faint , centro - symmetric `` wings '' .",
    "they have gained notoriety as a possible signature of a rapid ( within a few myr ) reorientation of the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) spin axis , conceivably induced by galaxy mergers in which either accretion torque or a smbh merger causes a spin - flip @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "wings are `` fossils '' tracing the prior jet axis which radiatively decay .",
    "however , no convincing case for reorientation has been made in any individual xrg , whereas several lines of evidence support a hydrodynamic origin for the wings .",
    "for instance , in most xrgs , the wings are coaligned with the minor axis of the host galaxy and the jet with the major axis @xcite . a similar major - axis ",
    "radio alignment trend exists in the x - rays @xcite .",
    "these results have been interpreted to favor models in which the wings are produced by radio - lobe ",
    "gas interaction @xcite .",
    "additionally , no clear signs of mergers have been found in a spectroscopic study of xrg hosts , whereas they may be overpressured @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we identify 4c  + 00.58 ( fig .  1 , classified as a candidate xrg by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as one of the best candidates for a merger - induced reorientation based on quantities derived from a deep _ chandra x - ray observatory _ observation and publicly available data .",
    "unlike other xrgs , the 4c  + 00.58 jet is coaligned with the _ minor _ axis of its host . even if only a fraction of xrgs are produced by reorientation , their frequency may be important for estimating _ laser interferometer space antenna _ detection rates .",
    "we use a galactic absorption of @xmath0  @xmath1 @xcite , as well as the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ cosmology ( @xmath2  km  s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "at a redshift of @xmath6 , @xmath7  kpc .",

    "the data were reduced with the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao v4.0 ) software , and spectral fitting was performed with xspec @xcite .",
    "we extracted a @xmath8  kev bandpass lightcurve ( binned to 600  s ) from empty regions to check for background flares , but found no 3@xmath9 deviations .",
    "the extended emission around 4c  + 00.58 is less than 45@xmath10 in radius , so we use local background for spectral extraction .",
    "we also use a nrao _ very large array _",
    "( vla ; * ? ? ? * ) 1.4 ghz map @xcite and a 4.9  ghz map produced by combining archival snapshot a - array data from @xcite and c - array data from program ac406 .",
    "we use sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) red ( 623.1  nm ) and green ( 477.0  nm ) images from two 54  s exposures of the host ( sdss j160612.68 + 000027.1 ) to measure color and magnitude , correcting for the smaller point spread function of the green images as well as sky background , the 1000-count software bias , and galactic extinction .",
    "the 1.4  ghz map is shown in the left panel of figure  1 .",
    "the primary lobes of the radio galaxy lie nearly on an east  west axis and have a well defined boundary , whereas the faint wings are oriented in a north  south direction .",
    "the jet experiences a dramatic bend ( by 60@xmath11 ) just before terminating , and the cocoon in the 1.4  ghz map is notable for a well defined edge with a surface brightness about five times that of the wings . the 5  ghz map resolves the jet into a string of knots (  3.3 ) .",
    "we detect no counterjet .    the x - ray emission ( fig .",
    "1 ) is made up of two components : bright emission spatially associated with the jet / agn and a compact diffuse atmosphere . to isolate the atmosphere , we mask point - like sources and restrict the energy bandpass to @xmath12  kev ( fig .",
    "2 ) ; this energy range contains 80% of the photons within 45@xmath10 . on the basis of an unsharp mask image and a weighted voronoi tessellation adapatively binned image @xcite , we have identified several x - ray cavities ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "these cavities , labeled c@xmath13 , c@xmath14 , c@xmath15 , and c@xmath16 , are low surface brightness regions in the hot atmosphere bounded by `` spurs '' of greater surface brightness .",
    "the cavities are deep negatives in an unsharp mask image in which a heavily smoothed map ( 40  px ) is subtracted from a lightly smoothed ( 3  px ) map .",
    "the residuals are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the sdss image ( fig .  3 ) reveals a dim , resolved extension to the southwest of the host galaxy .",
    "the elliptical host shows no obvious internal structure , but the extension may be a stellar shell from a prior minor merger ( for a discussion of shells see * ? ? ?",
    "the extension is red @xmath17 , but bluer than the host @xmath18 .",
    "the apparent magnitude of the entire extension is @xmath19 .",
    "the bright x - ray emission immediately near the jet is nonthermal , otherwise the extended emission is consistent with isothermal plasma out to 50  kpc from the agn , with @xmath20  kev within 25  kpc and @xmath21  kev outside .",
    "the photon statistics preclude a deprojection analysis . on the basis of the resulting emission measures , densities within 25  kpc",
    "are a few@xmath22  @xmath23 , implying pressures @xmath24 to @xmath25  dyne  @xmath1 .",
    "thus , we adopt a sound speed @xmath26  km  s@xmath3 throughout the region .",
    "the total luminosity of the hot atmosphere is @xmath27  erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "the gross morphology of the x - ray emission does not coincide with the host galaxy . using only the 10  ks exposure ,",
    "we argued @xcite that the orientation agreed with the host although the ellipticity did not . with deeper data",
    "it is evident that while we correctly excluded nonthermal emission to the southwest , we could not exclude nonthermal emission to the northeast .",
    "the most notable feature of the diffuse x - ray map is c@xmath14 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , which is collinear with c@xmath15 and the agn .",
    "c@xmath14 is enclosed by emission and cospatial with a spur in the radio cocoon , suggesting that c@xmath14 and c@xmath15 are jet - blown cavities .",
    "c@xmath13 and c@xmath16 are also collinear with the agn and are associated with the bases of the wings , with walls extending into the surrounding medium .",
    "the free - free cooling time of the c@xmath14 and c@xmath15 bounding material places an upper limit on their ages : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the temperature in units of @xmath30  k and @xmath31 is the density in units of @xmath32  @xmath23 . if c@xmath14 is a spherical bubble ( of radius 5  kpc ) inflated at a locally estimated pressure @xmath33  dyne  @xmath1 , the work done to inflate it is @xmath34  erg .",
    "since the transonic expansion time is 10  myr , the minimum average kinetic luminosity of the jet during that period is @xmath35  erg  s@xmath3 if c@xmath14 is jet - blown .",
    "the long wings are associated with low - signal x - ray structure ( fig .  2 , bottom right ) .",
    "the approximate wing symmetry implies coherent formation , but the southern wing is slightly longer .",
    "if the wings expanded transonically , their length ( @xmath36  kpc ) implies an age of 90  myr , although this is a minimum age since the wings are seen in projection and may expand subsonically .",
    "conversely , the synchrotron decay time @xmath37 provides a maximum wing lifetime assuming the radio emission traces the entire wing volume and the wings were inflated by the radiating plasma . to estimate @xmath37 , we follow @xcite and use the 1.4  ghz map to estimate the equipartition field @xmath38 .",
    "we take the spectral index , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , from low - resolution radio photometry and assume @xmath41 . for cylindrical wings of @xmath42  kpc and @xmath43  kpc",
    ", we obtain @xmath44  @xmath45 g .",
    "we then find the electron lorentz factor @xmath46 from @xmath47 } } = 4\\times 10^{-3 } b \\gamma^2 = 1.4 $ ]  ghz , and thus find @xmath48 where @xmath49 is in units of @xmath50 and @xmath51 is in @xmath45 g .",
    "this value represents the cooling time of the 1.4  ghz electrons ; we emphasize our assumption that this is `` first - generation '' plasma occupying the wings .",
    "@xmath37 is insensitive to projection effects relative to the transonic expansion time : if the wings are longer by a factor of 2 , @xmath38 decreases by a factor @xmath52 and @xmath37 increases by a factor @xmath53 .",
    "the disagreement between @xmath37 and the expansion time suggests either supersonic expansion ( i.e. like a jet - blown cocoon ) or wing replenishment by supersonic inflowing lobe plasma .",
    "the work required to inflate the wings , assuming the cylinders above , is @xmath54  erg .",
    "an age of 40  myr implies an average kinetic luminosity of @xmath55  erg  s@xmath3 applied to the wings alone .",
    "the strong central x - ray point source corresponds to the agn and contains 1100 counts .",
    "the spectrum is fit well by a model consisting of an unabsorbed power law with spectral index @xmath56 and a weak thermal model frozen at @xmath57  kev .",
    "the nonthermal luminosity is @xmath58  erg  s@xmath3 between @xmath8  kev .",
    "the x - ray jet is the next brightest feature and traces the radio jet well , including several x - ray knots ( fig .",
    "a super - sampled x - ray image reveals that two of these knots coincide with more compact knots visible in the 5  ghz image and a bright region in the 1.4  ghz jet .",
    "there is a modest radio ( @xmath59  ghz ) spectral gradient between the inner and outer jet ( table  1 ) , and the outer jet does not appear in the x - rays .",
    "along the inner jet , we measure a broad - band radio to x - ray spectral index , @xmath60 , which is consistent with the x - ray spectrum ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "thus , the x - ray emission is consistent with a synchrotron origin ( requiring a concave - down spectral energy distribution ) .",
    "alternatively , assuming an inverse compton origin for the x - rays , we follow @xcite to estimate the jet doppler factor @xmath62^{-1}$ ] in the knots by finding @xmath63 such that @xmath64 .",
    "this results in @xmath65 ( table  1 ) and @xmath66  @xmath45 g . as the jet x - ray emission is unlikely dominated by inverse - compton emission , @xmath67 is formally an upper limit .",
    "@xmath38 is derived with no knowledge of the x - ray emission and predicts @xmath68  dyne  @xmath1 , in agreement with spectral fitting estimate .",
    "although no counterjet is visible , the 1.4  ghz emission suggests the jet has point symmetry .",
    "if the jet tail is dragged , the tail will cool radiatively with its length set by the cooling time ( i.e. no additional plasma influx ) .",
    "we derive an upper @xmath69  @xmath45 g at @xmath70  ghz and thus find @xmath71  myr for @xmath72 .",
    "we assume @xmath67 declines along the jet , so for @xmath73 , @xmath74  myr .",
    "the projected length of the radio cocoon gives a transonic expansion time of 35  myr .",
    "the work done to excavate a cocoon with semimajor axis @xmath75  kpc and semiminor axes @xmath76  kpc is @xmath77  erg , so the minimum average kinetic luminosity while inflating the cocoon is @xmath78  erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "we consider three wing formation scenarios : an overpressured outburst , conical precession of the jet axis , and merger - induced reorientation of the jet axis .    in the backflow models ,",
    "wings are produced by pressure- or buoyancy - driven back - flowing plasma from the terminal shocks evolving in the hot medium .",
    "since we see no obvious evidence for a plumed jet _ directly _ feeding the wings , the most plausible of these models is a `` blow - out '' from an overpressured cocoon early in the source s life @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the native atmosphere confining the young jets is aspherical with a preferential direction along which the cocoon ruptures .",
    "the backflow model suffers from several difficulties .",
    "first , the wings must expand at most transonically .",
    "the long projected length of the wings in 4c  + 00.58 ( requiring an agn lifetime of at least 90  myr ) is difficult to reconcile with the cocoon length unless the cocoon inclination angle from the line of sight @xmath79 is less than @xmath80 .",
    "the equivalent widths of ( 3727 ) and ( 5007 ) measured by @xcite argue against a steep inclination @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the maximum wing lifetime @xmath37 disagrees with the transonic expansion time , although the wing plasma may be continuously replenished .",
    "second , the model relies on strong backflows typically associated with ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fr ) type  ii sources .",
    "4c  + 00.58 is not easily classified as fr  i or ii , but at @xmath81 and @xmath82  w  hz@xmath3 falls very close to the @xcite boundary ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "since xrgs generally lie near the @xcite fr  i / ii boundary , they may be a transition population @xcite .",
    "finally , the radio galaxy is misaligned with its host , so the @xcite model can not produce wings until the jet escapes the interstellar medium .",
    "conical precession is a simple model in which the jet axis swings around , so the wing extensions and post - bend jet are equidistant from the agn .",
    "this requires a steep inclination angle of @xmath84 . in this model ,",
    "the wings trace the jet history , and the oldest plasma can be no older than the synchrotron cooling time . to obtain the precession rate @xmath85 , we compare the projected length of the post - bend jet to its cooling time ( about 6 myr ) and obtain @xmath86  myr@xmath3 ( corresponding to a mildly supersonic @xmath87  km  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "a 180@xmath11 rotation takes @xmath88  myr and implies supersonic expansion for the cocoon .",
    "the timescale is consistent with the wing @xmath37 , but the model must also explain the larger far - side cone , as both the far - side cocoon and wing have longer projected lengths .",
    "notably , precession does not explain the presence of c@xmath14 and c@xmath15 , and numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that it would not preserve obvious cocoon structure .    in the reorientation ( spin - flip ) scenario ,",
    "the wings are fossil lobes of a jet whose direction rapidly changed , either due to accretion torque or coalescence of a smbh binary .",
    "there is circumstantial evidence for such a spin - flip : a possible stellar shell indicating a minor merger , and the cavities c@xmath14 and c@xmath15 with overlapping cocoon extensions implying somewhat recent jet  gas interaction along an old axis .",
    "we describe a reorientation scenario for 4c  + 00.58 presently .",
    "given the small size of c@xmath14 and c@xmath15 , the jet was in a weak or `` off '' state prior to the minor merger , but the smbh spin axis was aligned with the major axis of the host . upon ignition ,",
    "the jet quickly formed c@xmath14 and c@xmath15 .",
    "however , since the angular momentum axis of the accreting gas is generally misaligned with that of the smbh , accretion torque will reorient the black hole s spin within a few myr @xcite .",
    "hence , c@xmath14 must have expanded at @xmath89 if no prior cavity existed .",
    "once accretion torque moved the jet to the wing axis , it inflated the wings as active lobes .",
    "the transonic lateral expansion time of the wings is 10  myr , implying @xmath90 during wing inflation .",
    "the `` z - shaped '' wing extensions ( covering 30@xmath11 ) could be explained either as post - reorientation `` wiggles '' from a hot disk ( * ? ? ?",
    "* show that a hot disk is required for wiggles of this magnitude ) or interaction between the lobes and merging ism swirling into the host @xcite .",
    "these z - shaped extensions then evolve buoyantly , and may be replenished by the primary lobes once the jet axis has moved @xcite .",
    "we suppose the jet moved to its current position due to coalescence of the smbh binary or ongoing accretion torque , then formed the present cocoon .",
    "since the jet may have experienced small realignments during the wing inflation phase , we infer a reorientation timescale of fewer than 50  myr since jet ignition , well within the free - free cooling time of the c@xmath14 walls and constrained by the wing @xmath37 .",
    "although it is possible that the system represents only a single spin - flip from the wings to the present location , this hypothesis does not not explain c@xmath14 or c@xmath15 .",
    "the presence of a stellar shell must be confirmed , and it is possible that c@xmath14 and c@xmath15 are not jet - blown cavities but rather part of a cocoon - evacuated shell ( with bounding material describing a ring perpendicular to the jet ) produced by a jet - ignition shockwave .",
    "the overlap of c@xmath14 by the radio cocoon is then due to backflow filling the cavity . assuming a circular ring",
    ", the eccentricity of the ring implies @xmath91 , far above the 30@xmath11 required to reconcile the cocoon and wing lengths .",
    "there are few deep x - ray observations of xrgs . apart from 4c  + 00.58",
    ", there is a @xmath92  ks _ chandra _ observation of ngc  326 and a 50  ks exposure of 3c  403 @xcite .",
    "these data show x - ray emission on different scales and of differing surface brightness , forcing the hydrodynamic hypothesis to contend with a variety of environments .",
    "the cavities in 4c  + 00.58 also demonstrate that x - ray observations are not only useful for studying backflow models . our prior survey @xcite and this study suggest exposure times of at least 100  ks",
    "are required to examine detailed structure .",
    "we know of no clean evidence for merger - induced reorientation . even in our toy model ,",
    "the wings are produced by merger - induced accretion rather than an instantaneous spin - flip , so the black hole merger itself would involve mostly - aligned spins @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the presence of an apparent stellar shell suggests that searching for structure in the hosts of xrgs may provide strong indirect evidence for such mergers in a subclass of these objects .",
    "we have presented a deep _ chandra _ observation of the xrg 4c  + 00.58 .",
    "the hot atmosphere is roughly co - spatial with the radio galaxy and has a temperature of @xmath93  kev .",
    "an x - ray jet of about 5  kpc is detected , overlapping well with the 5  ghz knots .",
    "we synthesize information from the radio and x - ray maps to assess three wing - formation models based on approximate limiting timescales and argue that the hydrodynamic scenario faces several difficulties whereas circumstantial evidence favors the reorientation model .",
    "although 4c  + 00.58 does not obey the optical  radio correlation of xrgs @xcite , confirmation of any of the wing formation scenarios would bear on xrg formation generally .",
