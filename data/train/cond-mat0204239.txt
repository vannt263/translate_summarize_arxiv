    "nonequilibrium phenomena in superconductors continue to be the focus of attention .",
    "the dynamics of josephson junctions , phase slip phenomena in the dynamics of vortices and relaxation of the order parameter and supercurrents are few examples of the experimental effort that probe nonequilibrium aspects of superconductivity .    since the original work of abrahams and tsuneto @xcite there has been an ongoing effort in trying to obtain the effective time - dependent description of nonequilibrium phenomena from a microscopic bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) @xcite theory . whereas the effective ginzburg - landau ( gl ) @xcite description in the",
    "limit was derived by gorkov @xcite , the effective time dependent ginzburg - landau description is still the focus of a substantial theoretical effort .",
    "there is a large body of work that established the validity of a time - dependent nonlinear schroedinger equation that describes the dynamics of the order parameter at zero temperature @xcite .    at _ finite _ temperature",
    "the dynamical description is complicated by the presence of landau damping which prevents a local description in time because the spectral densities feature branch cuts that prevent a derivative expansion .",
    "this problem was originally pointed out by abrahams and tsuneto @xcite . at finite temperature landau",
    "damping cuts are unavoidable and result from processes that involve scatterings of quasiparticles in the thermal bath . in derivations of the effective lagrangian for dynamical phenomena from a microscopic theory the landau damping contribution had often been ignored @xcite .",
    "the absorptive contributions to the effective action of long wavelength phase fluctuations at finite temperature have been studied by aitchison et al .",
    "@xcite for a neutral bcs superconductor .",
    "these authors studied in detail the landau damping contributions to the effective action of phase fluctuations and concluded that for temperatures @xmath0 the effective propagator for the phase fluctuation ( bogoliubov - anderson - goldstone mode ) can be well approximated by simple quasiparticle poles at complex energy and describe damped excitations with a linear and temperature dependent dispersion relation and narrow widths .    an alternative approach to study nonequilibrium aspects of superconductors is based on kinetic theory .",
    "kopnin @xcite studied the nonequilibrium dynamics of flux flow in clean superconductors but did not address the validity of the time dependent landau - ginzburg description near the critical point .",
    "watts - tobin et al .",
    "@xcite studied the validity of the landau - ginzburg description near the critical point for _ dirty _ superconductors where relaxational processes are dominated by ( elastic ) collisions .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , the description of the relaxational dynamics for the amplitude and the phase of the order parameter , as well as the validity of the landau - ginzburg description _ near the critical point _ in _ clean _ neutral superconductors had been the subject of several recent studies but has not been completely understood .",
    "the region near the critical temperature , where @xmath1 with @xmath2 the finite - temperature gap ( order parameter ) , is the region of validity of the ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "the interest on a deeper understanding of the time dependent effective action for long - wavelength phase fluctuations has been rekindled by several recent developments .",
    "recently there has been a substantial effort to obtain the time dependent effective action of long - wavelength collective excitations associated with phase fluctuations in @xmath3-wave superconductors @xcite .",
    "in particular these studies focused on the novel carlson - goldman modes @xcite , which are goldstone - like modes in _ charged _ superconductors that emerge near the critical temperature . while at @xmath4 the anderson - higgs mechanism combines the goldstone and gauge fields into a gapped plasma mode , near the critical temperature a novel quasiparticle goldstone - like excitation , the carlson - goldman mode , is present in charged superconductors .",
    "this mode is a superposition of the bogoliubov - anderson - goldstone mode , present in _ neutral _ superconductors and the long - range gauge field which is screened at finite temperature . in ref .",
    "it was pointed out that the existence of this mode is associated both with screening and landau damping of phase fluctuations .",
    "the importance of the nonequilibrium dynamics of long - wavelength _ phase _ fluctuations has also been highlighted recently within the context of high - temperature superconductivity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent experiments in ultracold alkali atoms have demonstrated the trapping and cooling of _ fermionic _ alkalis , in particular @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "one goal of this present experimental effort is to observe a transition to a _",
    "neutral fermi superfluid _ for fermi systems with an _ attractive _ interaction between atoms in two different hyperfine states @xcite .",
    "recently the spectrum of low energy collective excitations in the _ collisionless _ regime has been studied , in particular focusing on the emergence of goldstone or phase fluctuations in these _ neutral fermi superfluids _",
    "a proposal for the detection of the phase transition to a neutral fermi superfluid in @xmath6 alkalis relies on the spectrum of long - wavelength collective ( goldstone ) excitations @xcite .",
    "the interest on neutral bcs fermi superfluids is interdisciplinary , from the current experimental efforts in fermi alkalis and in mixtures with bose alkalis @xcite , to neutron superfluidity in nuclear matter and neutron stars .",
    "for a recent discussion on neutral fermi superfluids and their interest in a wide variety of fields see ref .  .",
    "hence the study of the dynamics of phase fluctuations in neutral fermi superfluids ( or neutral bcs superconductors ) continues to be of timely interest and of experimental relevance .    * the goals of this article",
    "* : in this article we focus on the nonequilibrium _ real - time _ dynamics of phase and amplitude fluctuations in neutral bcs superconductors in the ginzburg - landau regime near the critical temperature .",
    "in particular we obtain the effective _ dynamical _ ginzburg - landau description of nonequilibrium relaxation of long - wavelength , low - frequency fluctuations of the order parameter _ near the critical point_.    while previous efforts , notably by aitchison et al.@xcite , focused on the long - wavelength , low - frequency effective action well below the critical temperature for @xmath0 our goal is to study the critical region @xmath7 with @xmath2 the finite - temperature gap .",

    "furthermore , the equations of motion describe an initial value problem that allows a real - time study of relaxation and damping .",
    "( iii ) we then focus on the ginzburg - landau regime @xmath8 and establish the _ dynamical _ ginzburg - landau effective action to one - loop order for long - wavelength , low - frequency fluctuations .",
    "this effective action is retarded and nonlocal because of landau damping . ( iv )",
    "we study the time evolution of small phase and amplitude fluctuations from the equilibrium configuration and reveal directly in real time the effect of landau damping .",
    "* main results * : implementing the schwinger - keldysh formulation of nonequilibrium field theory and the tadpole method we obtain the retarded equations of motion for small fluctuations , which in turn lead to ward identities associated with ( global ) gauge invariance both _ in _ and _ out of _ equilibrium . from these equation of motion",
    "we obtain the retarded one - loop effective action which is _ nonlocal _ as a consequence of landau damping .",
    "we then focus on the ginzburg - landau ( @xmath9 ) region and study the real - time relaxation of small phase and amplitude fluctuations . while the spectral density for phase fluctuations features a peak that suggests a goldstone - like dispersion relation , the relaxational dynamics is completely _ overdamped _ as a consequence of landau damping .    far away from the ginzburg - landau regime at low temperatures , the spectral densities for both phase and amplitude fluctuations feature narrow quasiparticle peaks confirming previous results @xcite . in particular ,",

    "we studied in detail the relaxation of phase fluctuations within and away from the ginzburg - landau regime . despite the fact that the spectral density features a sharp peak with a goldstone - like dispersion relation in the ginzburg - landau regime",
    "the relaxation is completely _ overdamped _ as a consequence of landau damping .",

    "away from the critical region , the contribution from landau damping is negligible .",
    "the long - wavelength amplitude fluctuations are severely landau - damped near the critical region and the relaxation time scales also feature critical slowing down .    while we have focused on the nonequilibrium dynamics of neutral bcs superconductors , as a next step we will apply these methods to the case of charged superconductors to study in detail the dynamics of the carlson - goldman modes as well as the effective action including gauge fields near the critical temperature .",
