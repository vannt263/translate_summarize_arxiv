    "the galactic center is host to a high concentration of energetic processes , driven by the interplay between the energetic output of several young star clusters , radiation and outflows powered by accretion onto the supermassive black hole , and dense molecular clouds that have large turbulent velocities .",
    "the young stellar population naturally explains the presence of the mixed - morphology supernova remnant sgr a east @xcite , a shell - like radio supernova remnant that exhibits two regions of bright , non - thermal x - ray emission @xcite , and at least two x - ray features that resemble pulsar wind nebula ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the x - ray emission from the brightest of these features has been described by various authors in the references above . however , whereas at radio wavelengths comprehensive catalogs of hii regions and non - thermal features near the galactic center are available ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we ran our search using nine composite images , composed of three energy bands ( the full 0.58.0  kev band , the 0.52.0  kev band to increase our sensitivity to foreground sources , and the 48  kev band to increase our sensitivity to highly absorbed sources ) and three spatial resolutions ( primarily for computational efficiency : the full 05 resolution for the inner 1024@xmath111024 pixels , 1resolution covering the inner 2048@xmath112048 detector pixels , and 2  resolution covering the entire image ) .",
    "for the purposes of source detection only , we removed events that had been flagged as possible cosmic - ray afterglows .",

    "we expect roughly one spurious source in our field .",
    "we used wavelet scales that increased by a factor of @xmath13 : 14 pixels for the 05 image , 18 pixels for the 1  image , and 116 pixels for the 2  image .",
    "the final source list was the union of the lists from the three images taken at different pixel scales and energies .",
    "sources were identified as duplicates if the they fell within the average radius of the 90% encircled - energy contour for the point spread function ( psf ) for 4.5  kev photons at the position of the source .",
    "when duplicate sources were found in the list , we retained the positions from the list derived from the highest - resolution images , either the finest pixel scale or the lowest energy band . among the list of 2933 sources identified with wavdetect , we selected 73 candidate diffuse features .",
    "for the second search , we used the wavelet reconstruction algorithm of @xcite .",
    "the algorithm searched for features in the 0.58.0  kev band image that were significant at the @xmath143@xmath15 level .",
    "the results of the decomposition were used to create an image of the field , and then a multi - scale vision model was used to extract the structural parameters of both point - like and extended sources .",
    "we defined as extended those sources that either ( 1 ) were clearly anisotropic , for which the ratio of the major to minor axes were greater than 1.8 , or ( 2 ) appeared extended , in that their major and minor dimensions were at least 3@xmath15 larger than the mean values at that offset from . in total , the algorithm tabulated 2709 objects , of which we identified 91 as anisotropic and 80 as unusually large , for a total of 171 extended sources .",
    "we then compared the lists of candidate sources , and found that only 36 objects were identified using both wavelet analyses .",
    "all of the sources that were only in one of the two lists were faint , and visual inspection suggested that many were likely to be close alignments of point sources .",
    "we examined this hypothesis by extracting the average spectra of these faint features ( the technique is described in  2.2 ) .",
    "we found that the average spectra could be described as a @xmath16 power law absorbed by a column density of @xmath17 @xmath18 , along with line emission at 6.7  kev from he - like fe with an equivalent width of 220 ev .",
    "this spectrum is similar to those of faint point - like sources in @xcite , which supports our hypothesis that these are not truly extended features .    at the same time , at least one feature previously identified as extended is not identified as such by either algorithm  cxogc 174545.5285829 , the candidate neutron star suggested to be associated with sgr a east by @xcite .",
    "our difficulty in automatically identifying this source as diffuse probably stems from the faintness of the extended portion of its emission .",
    "therefore , we caution that our algorithm for identifying extended features is certainly ( 1 ) not complete , in the sense that it could miss extended features , and ( 2 ) contains spurious features that are chance alignments of point sources .    we have mitigated the second problem by examining only the 34  sources that are found through both wavelet - based algorithms .",
    "the remaining 172 objects will be flagged as being `` possibly extended '' in an updated catalog of the point - like sources that we are preparing . in figures  [ fig : image][fig : sub_med ] , we display images with the 34  diffuse features marked . in figure",
    "[ fig : image ] , we display the entire field , but for readability we only mark the locations of features with offsets of at least 6  from , and plot boxes around portions of the field closer to the aim point that contain diffuse features .",
    "these sub - regions are displayed in figures  [ fig : sub_small ] and [ fig : sub_med ] .",
    "the clustering of sources in the center of the image results mostly from the fact that the _ chandra _  psf is smallest near the aim point , which provides us the ability to identify @xmath81  features as extended .      in order to compute the number of x - ray events received from each source , we drew by hand polygonal or elliptical regions enclosing each of the candidate diffuse features .",
    "the regions are plotted in figures  [ fig : image][fig : sub_med ] .",
    "we estimated the background counts in each region using surrounding annular regions that contained @xmath81000 total counts , after excluding both the diffuse features and circles enclosing 92% of photons from each point source ( regions excluding larger fractions of the psf would cover the inner part of the image , leaving no events suitable for estimating a local background ) .",
    "we then computed approximate photon fluxes by dividing the net counts received in each of four energy bands  0.52.0 , 2.03.3 , 3.34.7 , and 4.78.0  kev  by the mean effective area derived using the ciao tool mkacisarf .",
    "these energy bands were chosen to contain roughly equal numbers of counts , and so that the effective area in each energy range was roughly constant @xcite . in table  [ tab : sources ] we report the mean location , net counts , and estimated photon fluxes for each source .    to estimate the intrinsic slopes of the spectra and the absorption toward each source , we computed two hardness ratios . following @xcite ,",
    "the ratios were defined as the fractional difference between two energy bands , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number of counts in the hard band , and @xmath21 is the number of counts in the soft .",
    "the soft color was calculated using @xmath20 as the 2.03.3  kev band and @xmath21 as the 0.52.0  kev band , and was most sensitive to the absorption toward each source .",
    "the hard color was calculated using @xmath20 as the 4.78.0  kev band , and @xmath21 as the 3.34.7  kev band , and provided a good measure of the intrinsic hardness of a source @xcite .",
    "we list the hardness ratios in table  [ tab : sources ] , and plot them as a function of the 0.58.0  kev photon fluxes in figure  [ fig : hit ] .",
    "we also plot the hardness ratios and fluxes that we would expect for a variety of spectral shapes and luminosities and a single absorption column of @xmath22 @xmath23 of gas and dust , using the thick black lines .",
    "we find that all but one of diffuse sources have soft colors @xmath24@xmath25 , which implies that they are absorbed by @xmath26 @xmath18 of interstellar medium .",
    "this suggests that these sources lie near or beyond the galactic center .",
    "one source , g359.9770.076 , has a soft color of only @xmath27 , which implies that it is less absorbed , and probably lies within a few kpc of earth .",
    "the luminosities of these sources , assuming they lie at @xmath0@xmath288 kpc , are between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and in general their hard colors imply that their spectra are consistent with either a power law with photon index @xmath29 , or a @xmath30@xmath243  kev thermal plasma . for comparison , in figure  [ fig : hit ]",
    "we have also plotted contours denoting the locations of the point - like sources in this diagram @xcite .",
    "we find that the diffuse sources are slightly softer , with median hard color of 0.1 , compared to 0.2 for the point sources .",
    "we then modeled the spectra of the brightest sources in more detail .",
    "spectra were created by binning the source and background events over their pulse - heights .",
    "the background - subtracted spectra were then grouped such that each bin had a signal - to - noise ratio of at least 5 .",
    "we found that because of their extended nature and the high background in the image , sources required @xmath8400 net counts in order to provide 4 independent spectral bins , which is required for us to constrain independently the interstellar absorption and a two - parameter continuum model .",
    "for those sources with enough signal , the observed spectra were compared with models of an absorbed power law using the chi - squared minimization implemented in xspec version 12.2.0 @xcite .",
    "the efficiency and energy resolution of the detector were characterized using the above effective - area function and the the energy response computed using mkacisrmf .",
    "representative spectra of four sources are displayed in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "most of the sources could be adequately described by these simple absorbed continuum models , but this was largely a result of the low - signal to noise . the spectral parameters are consistent with those that would be derived from figure  [ fig : hit ] .",
    "however , the models did not adequately describe several of the sources with @xmath311000 net counts , and visual inspection revealed that these exhibited strong emission from low - ionization fe at 6.4  kev ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore , for all sources for which the spectra contained at least 5 independent spectral bins , we attempted to model the spectra as the sum of a power law plus gaussian line emission at 6.4  kev , absorbed by the interstellar medium .",
    "if the addition of a line to the model resulted in a decrease in reduced chi - squared , we tested the significance of the added line using markov chain monte carlo simulations of an @xmath32 test , as described in arabadjis , bautz , & arabadjis ( 2004 ) and @xcite .",
    "the @xmath32 value is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the values of chi - squared and the number of degrees of freedom for the model without the line , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the same values for the model with a line .",
    "we simulated a set of 1001000 spectra with parameters that were consistent with the measured parameters of the source ( the markov chain ) , and computed a theoretical distribution of the @xmath32 value under the assumption that no line was present .",
    "if the observed value of @xmath32 exceeded the theoretical distribution under the null hypothesis in all of 1001000 trials , we considered a line to be detected with @xmath2499%99.9% confidence . in table",
    "[ tab : spec ] , we list the parameters of the best - fit absorbed power law for each source we modeled , and either the measured value of the equivalent width of the 6.4  kev iron line or an upper limit to that value . we performed a similar search for the 6.7  kev line from the he - like 21 transition of fe , and only found one source with such a line , g359.9420.045 ( source 2 in table  [ tab : sources ] ) .",
    "the upper limits to the equivalent widths of the 6.7  kev lines from the other sources were generally 25% higher than those on the 6.4  kev lines , for the cases in which neither line was detected .",

    "these features are discussed extensively in @xcite and @xcite , and are produced because hard x - rays ( @xmath247  kev ) from a transient source are being scattered by molecular gas , and causing iron to fluoresce .",

    "in fact , this entire quadrant of the image exhibits unusually strong diffuse fe k-@xmath131 emission ( equivalent width 570 ev ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the features that we identify in this paper are simply the brightest manifestations of this pervasive scattered and fluorescent emission , and they probably trace regions of molecular gas with the highest optical depth .",
    "it is notable , however , that similar features are not seen toward other clouds with similarly high optical depth , particularly those with velocities of @xmath13220 km s@xmath133 and @xmath13240 km s@xmath133 just to the east of  ( e.g. , gsten , walmsley , & pauls 1981 ; oka  1998 ) .",
    "the clouds that do not exhibit fluorescent emission are slightly in the foreground of the field , as they are seen to cast a shadow in the number of x - ray sources along their lines of sight @xcite .",
    "the clouds without associated x - ray emission must not intersect the light - front of the transient that illuminated the fluorescent features .    the features with surface area @xmath41100 arcsec@xmath134 either exhibit no evidence for iron emission at 6.4  kev , or are too faint for such emission to be detected .",
    "based on their spectra , the x - ray emission from these features must either originate from a hot thermal plasma ( @xmath135  kev ; fig .",
    "[ fig : hit ] ) , or from non - thermal processes such as synchrotron or inverse - compton scattering . as we describe below",

    "this is the first paper to provide a comprehensive compilation of their properties . for brevity",
    ", we will refer to the features without obvious fluorescent iron emission as `` streaks . ''",

    "the emission measure is @xmath137 @xmath127 , where @xmath138 is the electron density , @xmath139 is the hydrogen density , and @xmath140 is the volume of the emitting region .",
    "the sizes of these features are typically @xmath141 arcsec@xmath130 , which for @xmath0@xmath288 kpc corresponds to projected areas of @xmath142 pc@xmath130 . if we assume that the volume is given by @xmath143 , then the electron density of the plasma is @xmath144 @xmath127 , where @xmath145 is normalized to 50 arcsec@xmath130 , and @xmath146 to @xmath147 ( 28  kev ) .",
    "therefore , the pressure is @xmath148 erg @xmath127 .",
    "this pressure is @xmath8300 times larger than that of the diffuse , @xmath149  kev plasma in the galactic center ( @xmath150 erg @xmath127 ) , and 50 times larger than the putative 8  kev plasma there ( @xmath151 erg @xmath127 ; * ? ? ?",

    "these fields strengths are thought to be present within radio - emitting filaments toward the galactic center @xcite , but the average field at the galactic center may be significantly lower ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "these wind nebulae have diverse morphologies , which depend upon how the pulsar wind interacts with the surrounding supernova remnant , how far the pulsar travels during the lifetime of the electrons in the wind nebula , and whether the pulsar is moving supersonically with respect to the ism . in the galactic center ,",
    "few of the pulsars are likely to be moving highly supersonically .",

    "therefore , if @xmath194 is significantly longer than 100 kyr , then the fraction of pulsars retained in the galactic center would be larger than we estimate ( 66% of pulsars have tangential velocities smaller than 200 km s@xmath133 , although many of these will have larger three - dimensional velocities ) . for comparison ,",
    "if we consider candidate pulsar wind nebulae to be those features that ( 1 ) exhibit no evidence for iron emission , and ( 2 ) are not obviously associated with supernova remnants already detected in the radio , then there are also @xmath420 of them in our image .",
