    "low - dimensional aggregates of nanoparticles absorbing , scattering and guiding electromagnetic waves are attracting growing interest because they can be used in various micro- and nano - systems where optical energy is received , transferred and converted on a subwavelength scale @xcite . if the material s refractive index is sufficiently large , then these aggregates can possess long - lived quasistates , which are polariton modes representing the superposition of light and polarization oscillation of the material @xcite .",
    "these modes propagate within the aggregates , while their losses due to light emission are very small .",
    "consequently , low - dimensional aggregates of particles can be used as waveguides for optical energy transport .",
    "this transferred energy can stimulate a number of processes such as the photoexcitation of a molecule or a chemical reaction@xcite .",
    "for example , if we excite the polariton mode within a linear chain of particles using a point harmonic source located near the end of the chain , then there exists a frequency domain , i. e. the passband , where almost all of the energy from the source will be guided by the chain @xcite .",
    "other modes in the related frequency domain can be treated as bound or guiding modes . to our knowledge ,",
    "the first nano - waveguide capable of transferring optical energy a distance of 100 nm was constructed by atwater and coworkers @xcite as a linear chain of spherical silver or gold particles .",
    "the use of metallic particles has an advantage in that the losses due to photon emission can be almost completely suppressed @xcite , yet the efficiency of energy transfer is suppressed due to optical energy absorption by free electrons .",
    "guiding systems of dielectric particles have negligible absorption losses , while radiative losses can also be avoided as dielectric materials have characteristically larger refractive indices with @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the finite size of the guiding energy band in periodic arrays of particles results in the the formation of slow light modes at the band edge @xcite .",
    "therefore , it may be more convenient to use dielectric materials having very weak light absorption  @xcite .",
    "frequency pass bands of linear chains were investigated @xciteand it was found that the top of the frequency pass band corresponds to the top of the brillouin band edge in quasi - momentum space , while the bottom of the frequency pass band is determined by the guiding mode criterion ( see eq.([condband ] ) below ) @xcite .",
    "it was discovered that the closer the frequency of electromagnetic waves emitted by the source to the upper boundary of the pass band and the longer the chain , the more effective the waveguide and the lower the amount energy is dissipated into the surroundings .",
    "it was shown that for @xmath1 , the rate of decay of electromagnetic waves decreases as @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "another example of a low - dimensional aggregate of particles possessing wave - guiding properties is the circular array of spherical particles . because of its symmetry",
    ", one can expect that the highest quality factor can be attained for particles arranged in a circle .",
    "a circle has no sharp ends in contrast with a particle chain where the lifespan of polariton is limited to the time it takes to travel from one end of the chain to the other @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite  that the bound modes in a circular array of spherical particles possess a quality factor that grows exponentially with the number of particles , just as in the circular arrays of cylinder - shaped antennas ( fikioris , freeman , apalkov , smotrova ) .",
    "as previously mentioned , waveguides comprised of spherical particles can be used to manipulate optical energy on a subwavelength scale .",
    "in addition , modes at the edge of the passband possess a vanishing group velocity which creates an interesting opportunity to realize the phenomenon of slow light @xcite .",
    "the properties of polariton modes within pass bands are quite similar to those of electrons within a wire .",
    "the question of interest is whether we can exploit several properties known about electron behavior in a wire for wave - guiding systems . in this manuscript",
    ", we investigate the effect of interference on the transport of optical energy .",
    "the geometry of the waveguide shown in figs .",
    "[ graph1a ] , [ graph1b ] , [ graph1c ] is similar to the one illustrating the aharonov - bohm effect in electronic systems .",
    "the sample geometry can be described as a `` traffic circle '' without an entrance or exit ( fig .",
    "[ graph1a ] ) or with them ( figs .",
    "[ graph1b ] , [ graph1c ] ) .",
    "the polariton is excited by a point source located near one of the aggregate particles as shown in figs .",
    "[ graph1a ] , [ graph1b ] , [ graph1c ] .",
    "practically , this source can be created by placing a dye molecule within an end particle ( particle a ) @xcite .",
    "when the frequency of the source belongs to the passband , almost all of the optical energy generated by the source is transferred through the first chain @xcite . after traveling through the first chain ,",
    "an electromagnetic wave enters the circle at the junction between the circle and the first chain ( particle b ) .",
    "it then splits into two beams , one of them propagating around the circle clockwise and the other counterclockwise .",
    "these two beams rejoin at the junction between the circle and the second chain ( particle c ) and travel through the second chain to particle d.     , width=566 ]            actually , the beam propagating along the circle clockwise from particle b to particle c may pass through particle c from one segment of the circle to the other segment and continue traveling from particle c back to particle b. analogously , the other beam propagating along the circle counterclockwise from particle b to particle c also may pass through particle c and continue traveling back to particle b in the other segment of the circle .",
    "this recirculation in both the clockwise and counterclockwise directions remarkably enhance interference effects .",
    "therefore , we investigate the interference of waves having frequencies corresponding to resonances of circular arrays where this enhancement is maximized .    to describe our expectations about the interference effect , we can suggest the following simple scenario perfectly that is also applicable to an electronic system .",
    "each of two beams of light may be expressed as a wave @xmath3 if the beam travels clockwise and @xmath4 if the beam travels counterclockwise . here",
    ", @xmath5 is the wave vector of the beam and it is defined by the frequency of the source , @xmath6 is the coordinate of a point on the circle ( we suppose that for point b @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 is the circumference of the circle .",
    "so , if these two beams interfere , the intensity of the field is given by the superposition of these two waves : @xmath9 this interference may have a number of interesting applications including , for instance , filtering and selective enhancement of a guiding signal .",
    "it is not clear though whether this simple interference model eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) is applicable to optical modes because of the strong spatial dispersion and essential non - local coupling of spherical particles composing the waveguide . in this manuscript , we show that despite the above - mentioned problems , our simple interference model eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) works quite well .    to ascertain that interference of polaritons in a circular array takes place ,",
    "we have provided numerical investigations of a circle with and without attached chains .",
    "we have studied three particular cases : a circle without chains , a circle with chains situated diametrically opposed to each other and a circle with chains situated orthogonally to each other . for each of these three cases ,",
    "we have investigated two situations : the presence and the absence of absorption .",
    "the system under consideration is a traffic circle composed of @xmath10 identical dielectric spherical particles ( see figs .",

    "the angle between the chains is denoted @xmath12 .",

    "[ graph1b ] , and if the chains are orthogonal to each other then one has @xmath14 fig .",
    "[ graph1c ] .",
    "we introduce an oscillating magnetic dipole oriented orthogonally to the system plane as the source of electromagnetic waves .",
    "a magnetic dipole is chosen because it corresponds to the guiding band with the lowest frequency and , consequently , the best guiding properties @xcite .",
    "indeed , as shown in the mentioned work , the lowest frequency guiding mode originates from magnetic - like mie resonance .",
    "if the system under consideration is a circle with chains , the source is situated near the end of one of the chains , as shown in figs .",
    "[ graph1b ] , [ graph1c ] .",
    "if the circle without attached chains is considered fig .",
    "[ graph1a ] , the source is situated outside of the circle near the first particle . in this manuscript , we consider gaas particles having a refractive index @xmath15 .",
    "gaas is a convenient to consider since it possesses one of the highest refractive indices amongst conventional optical materials and , consequently , it has better guiding properties ( cf .",
    "the absorption effect was also probed and we discuss it when reporting the results of our calculations .",

    "the multisphere mie scattering formalism @xcite ( see also @xcite ) has been developed to study the scattering of electromagnetic waves in aggregates of spherical dielectric particles .",
    "the electromagnetic field outside each particle may be represented as the sum of all incident waves falling on this particle ( say , the @xmath16-th particle ) and of diverging waves scattered by this particle : @xmath17 ,  @xmath18 . the incident wave @xmath19 , @xmath20 may be expressed as a linear combination of spherical vector harmonics @xmath21 , @xmath22 taken with respect to the center of @xmath23 particle @xmath24 analogously , the scattered wave @xmath25 , @xmath26 is a linear combination of spherical vector harmonics @xmath27 , @xmath28 corresponding to outgoing waves @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the coordinate of center of the @xmath23 particle ; indices @xmath31 enumerates all particles , @xmath32 is the total number of particles in the array ; index @xmath33 represents angular momenta of spherical vector harmonics , and index @xmath34 stands for the projection of angular momentum on the @xmath35-axis .",
    "the coefficients @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 are partial amplitudes of scattered and incoming spherical waves at the @xmath23 sphere .",
    "the incident wave falling on the @xmath16-th particle is the sum of the external waves emitted by the source and the waves scattered by all other particles . because of the boundary conditions at each sphere , amplitudes of these waves obey the relationship @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are mie scattering coefficients depending on the size and the refraction index of particles .",
    "they originate from boundary conditions for an electric field between particles and air .",
    "parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 are vector translation coefficients that depend on the relative position of spheres @xmath16 and @xmath45 . these coefficients express delayed multipole interactions of different spheres in the frequency domain @xcite .",
    "these translation coefficients can be used to represent the outgoing wave scattered by the @xmath46 particle as a sum of spherical vector harmonics @xmath47 , @xmath48 taken with respect to the @xmath23 particle as @xmath49    to complete the setup of the problem eq .",
    "( [ syst ] ) , one has to determine the coefficients @xmath38 and @xmath38 for the incoming wave of the point magnetic dipole source having the coordinate @xmath50 ( see figs .",

    "this external wave can be expressed as a linear combination of spherical vector harmonics @xmath51 , @xmath28 @xmath52    here @xmath53 and @xmath54 are partial amplitudes of an emitted wave characterizing the point source . as mentioned above , we chose the source to be the magnetic dipole parallel to the @xmath35 direction and perpendicular to the @xmath55 sample plane .",

    "eq.([syst ] ) has the form of a system of linear equations , with partial amplitudes @xmath36 and @xmath62 yet to be determined .",
    "our main task is to calculate these partial amplitudes and to investigate their dependence on the number of spheres .    in this work ,",

    "the parameter @xmath5 entering into eq.([1 ] ) is the quasi - wave vector of a polariton and it is determined by the frequency @xmath64 of the wave emitted by the source .",
    "the relationship between @xmath65 and @xmath5 is the wave dispersion law which has to be determined for the analysis of our simulation data .",
    "below we briefly described how we did that .    if the radius of the circle is large enough as in our case ( a circle containing @xmath66 particles ) , one can use the dispersion law for an infinite linear chain .",
    "any frequency @xmath65 lying in the conducting band of an infinite linear chain corresponds to a certain value of the quasi - wave vector @xmath5 .",
    "the frequency domain of bound modes , or the pass band , is the domain of frequencies where losses due to photon emission are completely suppressed in the limit @xmath67 .",
    "this frequency domain exists where photon emission is forbidden by the momentum conservation law . to illustrate , consider a polariton within an infinite chain of particles parallel to the @xmath35-axis .",
    "according to the light dispersion law , we can define the wave vector of light in vacuum as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the speed of light . if an optical mode can exist outside of the chain as a free photon it still has the fixed projection of the wave vector to the @xmath35-axis given by @xmath5 so we should have @xmath70 due to translational symmetry .",
    "then the perpendicular component of the electric field wave vector that describes the photon emission outside of the system can be expressed as @xmath71 .",
    "for unbound modes , this projection is real , meaning that the optical energy can escape from the chain of particles , while for bound modes it is imaginary so that the mode intensity decays at distance @xmath72 from the chain as @xmath73 .",
    "thus modes with @xmath74 are bound , while the modes with @xmath75 are unbound .",
    "besides that , according to the bloch theorem the absolute value of @xmath5 can not exceed the value @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the period of the chain .",
    "therefore , bound modes can possess quasi - wave vectors @xmath5 from the interval @xmath78 certainly , this condition may be satisfied only if @xmath79 .",
    "this guiding mode criterion is equivalent to the condition that the interparticle distance @xmath77 should be less than half the resonant wavelength : @xmath80 @xcite .    to find the dispersion law for a polariton within an infinite chain deych , shore , fan , meade  one has to calculate the eigenvalues of the frequency @xmath81 for the given quasi - wave vector @xmath5 .",
    "the eigenfrequencies can be computed using the condition of the existence of nontrivial solutions of a homogeneous system of equations @xmath82 according to the bloch s theorem , the partial amplitude in an infinite periodic chain can be represented by @xmath83 where @xmath5 is the quasi - wave vector and @xmath84 is the coordinate of the center of @xmath23 particle in the chain ( remember , we set @xmath85 ) .    substituting eq .",

    "as was discussed above , the source of electromagnetic waves in our problem of interest is a magnetic dipole directed perpendicular to the plane of the circle .",

    "our preliminary study of wave transmission through a traffic circle at various frequencies has demonstrated that it is most efficient for modes corresponding to resonances of a circular array ( see ref .",

    "the intensities for a circle without chains and for a circle with chains in the absence of absorption differ by six orders of magnitude .",

    ". however , quality factors of circles with chains behave similarly to those of finite linear chains where they increase with the number of particles according to the power law @xcite .",

    "this approximation is rough . for several positions of the junction the error can be as high as @xmath135 .",
    "still this approximation is convenient for a qualitative description of behavior of an electromagnetic field at the end of the second chain .",
    "the influence of absorption on the transmitted intensity of field at the end of the second chain is weak similarly to a circle without chains as considered previously .",
    "in this work we have investigated the interference of guiding modes in a traffic circle waveguide of dielectric spherical particles using the multisphere mie scattering formalism at wave frequencies corresponding to two resonant guiding modes . for different sample geometries we demonstrated that the field distribution within the circle as well as the transmitted intensity may be well approximated by interference of two optical beams propagating clockwise and counterclockwise around the circle .",
    "the main conclusion of this work is that strong interference exists in the waveguides composed of particles and is quite similar to interfenrence as seen in electronic systems .",
    "this interference can be used to control the output ( transmitted ) intensity through varying the system geometry and/or the mode frequency .",
    "these results must also be applicable to the subwavelength waveguides consisting of metal particles @xcite despite absorption by conducting electrons and can be used to narrow the transferring signal in the frequency domain .",
    "it is difficult to apply our results directly to experiments with whispering gallery modes in arrays of polystyrene particles @xcite because the dipolar approach is irrelevant for these modes having large angular momenta .",
    "however , interference effects might take place there because coupling of spheres is essentially local @xcite .",
    "another interesting application can be developed for the propagation of microwaves in arrays of coupled antennas @xcite which are very similar to our particle aggregates .",
    "interference can be used in this application for frequency selective emission , absorption or transport of the microwave signal .",
    "we do not discuss in detail frequency dependence of the transmitted intensity .",

    "<S> the interference of polariton guiding modes propagating through `` traffic circle '' waveguides composed of dielectric spherical particles is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of intensity of the wave on the position of the particle was studied using the multisphere the mie scattering formalism . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if the frequency of light belongs to the passband of the waveguide , electromagnetic waves may be considered as two optical beams running along a circle in opposite directions and interfering with each other . </S>",
