    "a _ reverse plane partition _ of shape @xmath0 is a filling of cells in @xmath0 with nonnegative integers such that all rows and columns are weakly increasing .",
    "one of the most prominent results in the study of reverse ( or ordinary ) plane partitions is the discovery of _ multiplicative _ generating functions , namely those which can be nicely factored .",
    "the first discovery is due to macmahon @xcite who proved the triple product formula @xmath1 for plane partitions @xmath2 of @xmath3 rectangular shape with parts at most @xmath4 .",
    "macmahon s study on plane partitions was later revived by stanley @xcite . among his vast amounts of results on plane partitions a multiplicative generating function involving the trace statistic is of great importance @xcite .",
    "stanley s trace generating function was much refined by gansner @xcite who derived the multi - trace generating function @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the set of reverse plane partitions @xmath7 of shape @xmath0 with @xmath8 rows and @xmath9 columns , @xmath10 the @xmath11-trace , and @xmath12 the shape conjugate with @xmath0 .",
    "note that plane partitions considered in are those with bounded parts but reverse plane partitions in are those with unbounded parts .    in this paper a close connection of reverse plane partitions with an integrable dynamical system , called the _ discrete two - dimensional ( 2d ) toda molecule _",
    "@xcite , is clarified . especially it is shown that a multiplicative partition functions for reverse plane partitions can be derived from each non - vanishing solution to the dynamical system ( theorem [ thm : pfsprod ] in section [ sec : partitionfunctions ] ) where reverse plane partitions considered are those of arbitrary shape with bounded parts . as a concrete example",
    "a partition function which generalizes both macmahon s triple product formula and gansner s multi - trace generating function is derived from a specific solution ( theorem [ thm : partitionfunctionexample ] in section [ sec : example ] ) .",
    "the result is an extension of the author s partition function for rectangular - shaped plane partitions @xcite .",
    "the key idea comes from a combinatorial interpretation of the discrete 2d toda molecule in terms of non - intersecting lattice paths ( section [ sec : latticepaths ] ) .",
    "note that viennot @xcite takes a similar approach to count non - intersecting dyck paths by using the quotient - difference ( qd ) algorithm for pad approximation .",
    "we see a brief review on the integrable dynamical system discussed throughout the paper .",
    "the discrete two - dimensional ( 2d ) toda molecule is one of the most typical integrable dynamical systems that was introduced as a discrete analogue of the toda lattice @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the discrete 2d toda molecule is described by the difference equations    [ eq : d2dtoda ] @xmath13    through a dependent variable transformation @xmath14 with @xmath15 the following equation is obtained from    [ eq : bilineareq ] @xmath16    that is the so - called bilinear form of the discrete 2d toda molecule .",
    "the bilinear form is solved by the determinant @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an arbitrary function defined over @xmath19 .",
    "the discrete 2d toda molecule is therefore solved by @xmath20 , @xmath21 given by with if the determinant does not vanish .",
    "conversely there exists a function @xmath22 on @xmath19 which satisfies with for any solution @xmath23 , @xmath24 to .",

    "moreover such an @xmath22 is uniquely determined up to the transformation @xmath25 by any non - vanishing function @xmath26 on @xmath27 .    giving a non - vanishing solution @xmath20 , @xmath21 to the discrete 2d toda molecule",
    "is thus essentially equivalent to giving a function @xmath22 over @xmath19 .",
    "in this paper we adopt a matrix - like coordinate to draw a square lattice @xmath19 where the nearest neighbors @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 of a lattice point @xmath32 are located on the south , north , east and west of @xmath32 respectively .",
    "we call a subset @xmath33 of @xmath19 _ regular _ such that ( i ) if @xmath34 then @xmath35 for all @xmath36 ; ( ii ) if @xmath34 then @xmath37 and @xmath38 for some @xmath36 .",
