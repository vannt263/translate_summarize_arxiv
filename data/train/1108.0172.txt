    "this work is motivated by the following problem proposed by briskin , franoise and yomdin  @xcite : given a trigonometric polynomial , @xmath4 , determine all trigonometric polynomials , @xmath5 , such that the one - parameter abel equation @xmath6 has a parametric center ( i.e. , for all @xmath7 we have @xmath8 for every trajectory close to @xmath9 ) .",
    "this problem in turn is closely related to the poincar center - focus problem for planar vector fields , as in many cases of interest there are transformations to the trigonometric abel equation ( see @xcite ) .    in particular , a necessary and sufficient condition in order for to have a parametric center to first order in @xmath7 ( see @xcite ) is @xmath10 where @xmath1 and @xmath0 are primitives of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the trigonometric moment problem consists of given a trigonometric polynomial @xmath1 , obtain all trigonometric polynomials @xmath0 such that holds .",
    "thus , the moment problem is `` a first order '' approach to the parametric centers .",
    "moreover , briskin , roytvarf and yondim  @xcite have recently proved that the moment problem is indeed equivalent to the parametric center problem `` at infinity '' .",
    "we shall obtain sufficient conditions on @xmath1 in order to solve the trigonometric moment problem .",
    "these conditions can be computed for any given trigonometric polynomial @xmath1 in terms of the associated monodromy group . moreover , since the number of possible monodromy groups for any given degree is finite , they can be computed ( theoretically at least ) up to any given degree .",
    "we have checked up to degree @xmath2 and they hold for all trigonometric polynomials with real coefficients .",
    "the few exceptions we encounter have complex coefficients .",
    "the moment problem has been extensively studied in the polynomial version , thus , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are polynomials instead of trigonometric polynomials ( see , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "recently it has been completely solved by muzychuk and pakovich  @xcite who show that @xmath0 satisfies",
    "if and only if there exist polynomials @xmath11 , @xmath12 , such that @xmath13 @xmath14 the preceding identities can be referred to as a `` weak composition condition '' .",
    "inspired by this result , we study whether a similar result holds for the trigonometric moment problem .",
    "we fix a trigonometric polynomial @xmath1 and try to obtain all trigonometric polynomials @xmath0 such that @xmath15    working instead with respect to a complex variable @xmath16 , this problem is equivalent to the following : given a laurent polynomial @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the space of complex laurent polynomials @xmath19 $ ] , find all @xmath20 such that @xmath21    the main difference with the polynomial case is that ( up to conjugation by a mbius transformation ) the factorization of laurent polynomials can happen in two distinct ways : a laurent polynomial @xmath1 can be written as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , or as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26 ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "these two types of factorization give rise to two different mechanisms which imply the vanishing of the moments .",
    "our aim is to show that these two mechanisms are enough to solve the trigonometric moment problem for a large number of cases .",
    "firstly , if @xmath1 can be written as @xmath27 , @xmath28 with @xmath23 , then it is easy to see ( proposition  [ prop : zm ] ) that if , for some @xmath29 , we write @xmath30 where the coefficients of @xmath31 in @xmath32 vanish for all @xmath33 , then @xmath0 satisfies if and only if @xmath34 thus , the problem can be reduced to one of lower degree .",
    "we call this condition : @xmath35    on the other hand , if @xmath1 can be factorized as @xmath36 for some @xmath37 $ ] and @xmath38 , @xmath12 , then a straight - forward computation ( proposition  [ prop : laufactor ] ) shows that will be satisfied whenever we can write @xmath39 for some @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "we call this condition : @xmath41,\\quad w_k \\in \\mathcal{l } , \\quad k = 1,\\ldots , l , \\\\ & q = q_1\\circ w_1+\\ldots+q_l\\circ w_l . \\end{split}\\ ] ]    our approach to these problems is via the monodromy group of the laurent polynomial @xmath1 . in particular we find a condition on the monodromy group which is satisfied if and only if @xmath42 for some @xmath28 ( lemma  [ le : blocks ] ) and hence the problem is reducible to one of lower degree , and a condition which if satisfied implies condition for any @xmath0 satisfying ( theorem  [ theo : method ] ) .    in the following sections we show how the trigonometric moment problem can be translated in terms of the monodromy group of @xmath1 and then , using the program gap , show how all transitive permutation groups of degree @xmath3 or less satisfy either condition or except for a relatively small number of exceptional groups",
    ". we then study three of the four simplest such groups in more detail ( the other one has been studied by pakovich , pech and zvonkin in the paper  @xcite ) .",
    "we obtain corresponding laurent polynomials , which are of degree 9 , 10 and 16 , respectively , and prove the existence of solutions not satisfying conditions or .    in the last section we consider the case of real trigonometric polynomials , which is the most important case for applications .",
    "we show that in this case the monodromy group has additional structure and compute via gap that all examples up to degree @xmath3 fall into cases or .",
    "we give a proof that this is also true whenever @xmath1 has prime degree , but were unable to prove the general result , which we leave as a conjecture .    restating theorem  [ theorem2 ] in terms of real trigonometric polynomials , we obtain the following result .",
    "assume that @xmath43 are a trigonometric polynomials with real coefficients up to degree 15 . then hold if and only if either    1 .",
    "there exist a polynomial @xmath44 , and an integer @xmath28 , such that @xmath45 . in this case",

    "moreover , we want to see if they can be realized as monodromy groups of laurent polynomials . given a set of @xmath204 generators of the group and for each generator a ramification point on the riemann sphere",
    ", we can invoke riemann s existence theorem to guarantee that this monodromy group is realizable by an algebraic function which is ramified in exactly these points , and whose monodromy around these points is given by the generators ( see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , we can calculate the genus of the covering given by the algebraic function via the riemann - hurwitz formula .",
    "if the genus of the cover is zero for some choice of generators for which the generator around infinity is @xmath315 as above then the associated function must be a laurent polynomial .",
    "the whole process can be automated , and we obtain the following results , where the first row gives the degree of the permutation group , the second the number of non - isomorphic permutation groups and the final row the number of exceptions . for the other possible degrees",
    "less than @xmath3 there are no exceptions ( we have not given the number of possible transitive groups for these degrees ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     let @xmath316 be the set of laurent polynomials up to degree @xmath3 .",
    "for any @xmath317 , if @xmath55 is not one of the exceptional groups in the list above , then @xmath29 satisfies if and only if it is reducible via condition to a set of moment equations of lower degree , or satisfies the weak composition condition .",
    "each of the exceptional groups above can be realized as the monodromy group of a laurent polynomial , although it is only possible to explicitly calculate these polynomials in simple cases .",
    "we have not been able to verify that each exceptional group does indeed give laurent polynomials @xmath1 and @xmath0 which satisfy but neither nor , but we give in detail below , three of the four simplest cases of exceptional groups , showing how they indeed give such @xmath0 .",
    "a fourth case is considered by pakovich , pech and zvonkin @xcite .",
    "for the three cases detailed below , we have computed explicitly all laurent polynomials @xmath0 of bi - degree @xmath318 satisfying but neither or . to do this we invoke theorem  7.1 of @xcite which says that if @xmath319 where @xmath320 is the number of distinct vectors in the orbit of @xmath321 , then holds .    for groups of low degree ( up to @xmath322 )",
    "we have tried to find how many of the transitive permutations groups can be actually realized as monodromy groups of polynomials or laurent polynomials .",
    "although our calculations are not complete , at least half of these groups are realizable as such , and so the small number of exceptional cases in the table above does indeed appear to be noteworthy .",
    "the two groups of degree @xmath323 are @xmath324 acting on @xmath323 elements , for which there is an example non - satisfying the weak composition condition  @xcite , and @xmath325 acting on @xmath323 elements ( @xmath326 ) , with two possible elections of the cycle of infinity ( both having cycle shape @xmath327 ) .",
    "the two possible infinity cycles for the group @xmath326 are , up to conjugation , @xmath328 and @xmath329",
    ".    the elements of @xmath326 can have cycle shape @xmath330 , @xmath331 or @xmath327 . since there must be @xmath323 critical points , and previous permutations have @xmath332 , @xmath333 , and @xmath334 critical points associated , respectively ,",
    "then the unique possibility is that there is exactly two critical values , one of cycle shape @xmath330 and the other @xmath331 .",
    "therefore , choosing one of the critical values as zero , and taking the leading coefficient equal to one , one obtains : @xmath335@xmath336 now deriving , @xmath337 since @xmath338 does not divide @xmath339 , then @xmath340 .",
    "therefore , we have the following equation in @xmath341 : @xmath342 solving that equation , the solutions with @xmath343 are : @xmath344 where @xmath345 or @xmath346 we shall take the first solution and @xmath347 .",
    "it can be proved that its monodromy group is indeed @xmath326 , for instance , computing its `` dessin denfants '' ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] where the circles and squares denote the pre - images of the two critical values ) . moreover , as @xmath326 has no non - trivial imprimitivity systems , @xmath1 is indecomposable .",
    "now , we shall look for the solutions of the form @xmath348 imposing that @xmath349 , for @xmath350 , one obtains @xmath351 @xmath352 @xmath353 @xmath354    to prove that @xmath355 for every @xmath213 , we use theorem  7.1 of @xcite .",
    "this says that it is sufficient to check that @xmath355 for every @xmath356 , where we have calculated ( via gap ) that @xmath357 .",
    "this can be confirmed very easily via direct computer - aided computation ( in our case with mathematica and maple ) .",
    "thus , discounting the constant solution , we have a @xmath332-dimensional vector space of solutions , @xmath0 , which do not satisfy the weak composition condition .",
    "now we study the unique group of degree @xmath322 that we have obtained . for this group",
    "we obtain that the possible permutation corresponding to a loop around infinity have cycle shape @xmath358 . moreover , the permutations of @xmath359 have cycle shape @xmath360 , @xmath330 , @xmath331 , @xmath361 , @xmath358 . after trying several combinations , considering two critical values with permutations associated with cycle shape @xmath360 and @xmath361 , and proceeding as in the group @xmath326 , we obtained the following laurent polynomial with monodromy group @xmath359 with `` dessin denfants '' shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] ( again we denote the critical points corresponding to one of the critical values with squares and the corresponding to the other with circles ) : @xmath362    although it is realizable with laurent polynomials of degree @xmath322 , since the permutation corresponding to a loop around infinity has cycle shape @xmath358 , the corresponding trigonometric polynomial has degree @xmath363 .",
    "now we check for the solutions @xmath364 , obtaining the three dimensional space defined by the equations : @xmath365 again , we use theorem  7.1 of @xcite , noting that @xmath320 in this case is @xmath333 , and check that @xmath366 for every @xmath367 .",
    "we note that @xmath1 is indecomposable since the action of @xmath359 has no non - trivial imprimitivity system .",
    "hence , discounting the constant solution and noting that @xmath368 can be chosen arbitrarily in the equations above , we obtain a @xmath332-dimensional space of solutions that do not satisfy the composition condition .      the simplest case where the action of the monodromy group has a non - trivial imprimitivity system is the group of degree @xmath369 with number 195 in gap .",
    "a laurent polynomial having this group as its monodromy group ( which is represented in figure  [ fig:3 ] ) is @xmath370 where , @xmath371 since the group @xmath372 has a unique non - trivial imprimitivity system , the decomposition above is the the only one possible .",
    "we seek a solution @xmath373 .",
    "however , since we can ignore the constant solution , and we already know that any linear combination of @xmath178 , @xmath374 and @xmath375 are solutions which satisfy the composition conjecture , we shall make the assumption that @xmath376 for @xmath377 .",
    "the remaining solutions must therefore be exceptional ones .",
    "a calculation in gap shows that @xmath378 in this case .",
    "hence , by theorem  7.1 of @xcite , it is sufficient to calculate the integral up to @xmath379 .",
    "the solutions form a 6-dimensional space .",
    "as the expressions are cumbersome , we only give two generators of this space : @xmath380",
    "in this section we consider trigonometric polynomials with real coefficients . in this case , the laurent polynomial associated to the trigonometric polynomial via @xmath381 , @xmath1 must satisfy the equation @xmath382 , where @xmath383 .",
    "conversely , any laurent polynomial satisfying this equation must correspond to a real trigonometric polynomial .",
    "every such polynomial must have bi - degree @xmath384 .",
    "it follows from the above that if @xmath385 is a solution of @xmath197 for @xmath386 , @xmath387 , then so is @xmath388 , where @xmath389 .",
    "clearly this map extends to an element of the galois group @xmath55 .    for @xmath386 , @xmath387 , we label the roots as follows : @xmath390 and @xmath391 where @xmath392 is a primitive @xmath313-th root of unity .",
    "the monodromy at infinity corresponds to the cycle @xmath393 , and the map @xmath394 is given by the permutation @xmath395 .",
    "these two elements generate a copy of the dihedral group @xmath396 .        for any @xmath398 ,",
    "@xmath29 satisfies if and only if either is reducible via condition to a set of moment equations of lower degree , or satisfies condition . in the first case",
    ", the reduced moment equations still satisfy the condition @xmath399 , and so we can iterate this process of reduction so that all @xmath0 satisfying can be explained by these two processes .",
    "we note that when condition holds , and @xmath400 , then the decomposition corresponds to expressing the original polynomials in terms of @xmath401 and @xmath402 .",
    "the condition @xmath382 then implies that @xmath187 is a real polynomial .",
    "let @xmath403 be the decomposition , where we can choose @xmath187 to be a monic polynomial without loss of generality . from the condition",
    "@xmath404 we see that the highest and lowest order terms of @xmath205 must be in the form @xmath405 and @xmath406 for some @xmath407 and @xmath110 .",
    "now , it is easy to see that @xmath408 since this second term does not vanish , the first must be zero , and hence @xmath178 is the laurent polynomial associated to a real trigonometric polynomial .",
    "it is straight forward to show that @xmath382 implies that @xmath187 must therefore be a real polynomial .",
    "1 .   @xmath412 , and @xmath413 where @xmath414 is the sum of the monomials of @xmath0 divisible by @xmath281 .",
    "2 .   there exist @xmath415\\cup \\mathbb{c}[z^{-1}])$ ] , @xmath416 $ ] , such that @xmath200 , @xmath417 .      by theorem  25.6 of @xcite ( or theorem 13.11.7 of @xcite ) , since @xmath55 contains a dihedral group as a regular subgroup then it is a @xmath129-group .",
    "this means that if there are no non - trivial blocks then the group is two - transitive . in this case @xmath418 .",
    "if we sum up the vector @xmath419 moved by the stabilizer of @xmath123 , we get a vector proportional to @xmath420 .",
    "therefore , it is easy to prove that @xmath300 and so we are in case @xmath127 above with @xmath421 .",
    "suppose there is no block containing @xmath123 included in @xmath422 .",
    "then every block containing @xmath123 is of the form @xmath423 for some @xmath424 . by the way that @xmath425 acts , the rest of the blocks are @xmath426 , @xmath427 .",
    "if there are two such block systems , then taking the numbers @xmath428 as vertices , and the blocks of the two block systems as edges , we get a graph which decomposes into a number of closed loops with an even number of edges ( the vertices alternate between those in @xmath144 and those in @xmath429 , and the edges alternate between those corresponding to the two block groups ) . since the group @xmath55 takes the graph to itself , it is easy to see that the intersections of the set of vertices in each of these loops with @xmath144 and @xmath429 give a block system with the block containing @xmath123 lying within @xmath422 . hence , we are back in case @xmath224 again",
    ".    finally , we can suppose that we have just one block system , with blocks @xmath430 , @xmath427 .",
    "since @xmath144 is not part of a block system , then there is at least one @xmath132 for which @xmath144 has a non - empty image in both @xmath428 and @xmath429 .",
    "let @xmath431 be the vector with @xmath123 in the @xmath432-th place and @xmath433 in the @xmath434-th place .",
    "the element @xmath425 of @xmath55 acts on the @xmath431 as a cyclic group of order @xmath313 .",
    "since @xmath313 is prime , there are only two rational invariant subspaces of the space generated by the @xmath431 under the action of @xmath425 .",
    "the one is generated by @xmath435 and the other is generated by all @xmath436 with @xmath437 .",
    "any @xmath438 with @xmath439 and with not all @xmath440 the same , must therefore generate the whole space under the action of @xmath425 .",
    "let @xmath441 , then since the action of @xmath109 respects the blocks , we see that @xmath442 , where @xmath443 . by our choice of @xmath109 ,",
    "not all the @xmath440 are zero nor are they all @xmath123 and hence the element @xmath444 must also lie in @xmath270 .",
    "finally , let @xmath445 be the vector associated to the block @xmath446 , then we get @xmath447 .",
    "we are therefore in case @xmath127",
