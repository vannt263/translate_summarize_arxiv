    "maser emission of different molecules ( sio , oh , h@xmath10o ) is observed in evolved stars , from red giants through to planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "this emission seems to be stratified in the envelopes of agb stars , with sio masers located close to the stellar surface , water masers at @xmath11 au , and oh masers further away , up to @xmath12 au @xcite . in the evolution of an agb star to a pn , masers disappear sequentially , starting from the innermost ones @xcite . only water and oh masers are generally found in proto - pne , but as the star enters its pn phase , water molecules are rapidly destroyed by the ionizing radiation @xcite . therefore water masers are not expected in pne unless these are extremely young .",
    "the first detection of water maser emission in a pn was obtained in k3 - 35 @xcite .",
    "maser emission in this source is observed distributed in a disk - like structure around the central star as well as at the tips of a bipolar jet .",
    "recently ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter dg04 ) carried out a survey for water maser emission toward a sample of 26 pne , to check whether water masers are relatively common toward these kind of objects or if k3 - 35 is an extraordinary case .",
    "as a result of this work they detected a new cluster of water masers toward the southern source iras 17347 - 3139 , which constitutes the second bona - fide pn known to show water maser emission .",
    "the low rate of detection ( 1 out of 26 ) is statistically compatible with the short ( @xmath13 yr ) lifetime of water molecules in the envelopes of pne .    very large array ( vla ) maps of iras 17347 - 3139 ( dg04 ) show 13 maser components , distributed in a ellipse with axes @xmath14",
    "( @xmath15 au at 0.8 kpc ) , with the 22 ghz radio continuum emission located at one of the tips of its major axis ( dg04 ) .",
    "this suggests a possible binary nature for this source , with the radio continuum emission related to the central star , and the water maser ellipse associated to a companion .",
    "the radio continuum emission of iras 17347 - 3139 shows a spectral index @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) between 4.9 and 14.9 ghz ( dg04 ) , consistent with a partially optically thick ionized region .",
    "however , the flux density at 22 ghz was significantly lower than the value expected from the spectral index of 0.76 found at lower frequencies .",
    "this discrepancy could be explained as a combination of source variability ( the 22 ghz data were taken 11 years later than those at lower frequencies ) , calibration errors ( given the low elevation of this southern source from the vla ) , extended emission ( @xmath18 ) not sampled by the vla , or a change in the opacity regime .",
    "the last possibility is especially compelling .",
    "if the ionized region becomes optically thin between 14.9 and 22 ghz , one would expect a flat spectral index at frequencies higher than the turnover frequency .",
    "knowing the turnover frequency of the ionized region would allow us to measure some of its physical parameters .",
    "obviously quasi - simultaneous radio continuum observations from a southern telescope were necessary to rule out variability and calibration effects , and to determine whether the turnover frequency of the emission is indeed around 20 ghz",
    ". the flux density and spectral index of radio - continuum emission can provide interesting information about the ionized region and , by inference , also about the physical characteristics of the central star .",
    "given that water maser emission is a rare phenomenon in pn and that it is thought to be present only among the youngest ones it is important to study in detail iras 17347 - 3139 to see whether we can find some special characteristics that may be related to its ability to pump water masers .    in this paper",
    "we present a new , detailed study of the spectral index of iras 17347 - 3139 between 2.4 and 24.9 ghz . in sec .",
    "[ sec : obs ] we describe our observations and we discuss our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : dis ] .",
    "radio continuum observations of iras 17347 - 3139 were carried out with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) of the australia telescope national facility , on 2004 march 4 and 10 .",
    "we observed at 11 different frequencies between 1.4 and 25 ghz on both days .",
    "however , the data at 1.4 ghz were not useful due to interference .",
    "the total bandwidth in all cases was 128 mhz , sampled over 14 channels .",
    "the source pks 1934 - 638 was used as the primary flux calibrator , while ivs b1759 - 396 was the phase calibrator .",
    "flux densities for those calibrators are shown in table [ tab : cals ] .",
    "the phase center of our observations was located at @xmath19 = @xmath20 , @xmath21 = @xmath22 , the position of the radio continuum emission from iras 17347 - 3139 ( dg04 ) .    .flux",
    "densities of calibrators [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]         the point at 2.4 ghz is given as an upper limit although the map shows emission of @xmath23 mjy near the position of the radio continuum emission of iras 17347 - 3139 at other frequencies .",
    "however there is a relatively strong extragalactic source , txs 1734 - 314 , within the primary beam with a flux density of @xmath24 mjy at 2.4 ghz and peak intensity located at @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( but undetected at the other frequencies ) .",
    "txs 1734 - 214 produces sidelobes stronger than 10 mjy , and therefore , we can not be certain that the emission apparently associated to iras 17347 - 3139 at 2.4 ghz is real , and even if it is , we can not determine its flux density properly .",
    "source confusion makes snapshot data from a linear array like atca difficult to calibrate and process @xcite , especially at the deconvolution stage .",
    "the upper limit we give in table [ tab : fden ] is the flux density of the strongest sidelobe in the map . a more accurate determination or upper limit on the 2.4  ghz flux density of iras 17347 - 3139 would require imaging the field of view with better uv coverage . with this upper limit",
    "we estimate a spectral index @xmath27 between 2.4 and 4.3 ghz which is consistent with the ionized region being in the optically thick regime at 2.4 ghz , since we expect a spectral index @xmath28 in that case .    for the detected emission , from 4.3 to 24.9 ghz , the spectrum of iras 17347 - 3139 rises with increasing frequency .",
    "this is not consistent with our result in dg04 using the vla in which the flux density seemed to drop at 22 ghz .",
    "we think this discrepancy is most likely due to calibration errors in the vla data at these high frequencies and at low elevation , or to extended emission ( @xmath18 ) being resolved out by the vla .    a careful analysis of the spectral index ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spin ] ) shows that it is decreasing at the highest frequencies .",
    "we estimate an index of @xmath0 between 4.3 and 8.9 ghz ( consistent with our vla estimate of @xmath29 , dg04 ) whereas the values of flux densities at @xmath30 ghz are slightly but significantly lower than those expected from the extrapolation of the lower frequency fluxes . we derive a spectral index of @xmath31 between 16.1 and 24.9 ghz .",
    "therefore it seems that the radio continuum emission is becoming optically thin around the highest frequencies we sampled , as suggested in dg04 .",
    "of course an accurate determination of the turnover frequency would require observations at frequencies even higher than 24 ghz to reach the region of the spectrum where the spectral index would be @xmath32 .",
    "it is noticeable that the spectral index does not change much over a wide range of frequencies ( from 4.3 to 24.9 ghz ) , rather than showing a rapid transition between the optically thick and thin regimes , which would occur in the case of an homogeneus hii region .",
    "such relatively constant spectral indices are expected in ionized regions with a power - law decrease of electron density with distance from the central star @xcite . in our case",
    "an average spectral index of @xmath33 would require the electron density to vary as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the distance to the central star .",
    "similar spectral indices are also expected if the radiocontinuum emission arises from a collimated wind , as suggested for the radio core of m2 - 9 @xcite .",
    "however , as discussed in dg04 , in the case of iras 17347 - 3139 the derived mass loss - rate under the assumption of a wind is @xmath36 @xmath37 yr@xmath9 , much higher than expected in central stars of pne and proto - pne ( @xmath38 @xmath37 ; @xcite ) , and @xmath39 orders of magnitude larger than the value derived for the core of m2 - 9 by @xcite , which was already difficult to explain even if the main source of mass - loss were an agb star in a symbiotic system .",
    "therefore , in principle we favor that the radio continuum emission arises from an ionized nebula , although higher - resolution observations would be useful to determine whether there is a collimated radio outflow in iras 17347 - 3139 .    from the decrease in the spectral index at @xmath40 ghz",
    "we can estimate the turnover to be around this frequency . as mentioned in dg04 , assuming a turnover frequency of @xmath40 ghz we derive an emission measure @xmath41 @xmath4 pc . in that paper",
    "we estimated a distance of 0.8 kpc based on two methods ( evolutionary arguments , and statistical distance ) . unfortunately , the statistical distance was incorrect , and it should be @xmath42 kpc instead of 0.8 kpc ( using the scale of * ? ? ?",
    "* based on the mass - radius relationship )",
    ". therefore we have to consider a distance range of 0.8 - 6 kpc in the determination of other parameters .",
    "we also note that statistical distances for pne are very uncertain and they can vary up to more than a factor of @xmath43 depending on the particular scale used ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "with a distance range of 0.8 - 6 kpc we derive an average electron density @xmath44 @xmath45 for a size of @xmath46 .",
    "iras 17347 - 3139 is an unusual pn , since it is one of the only two known to harbour water maser emission .",
    "therefore it is important to look for any other observational characteristics that may be related to the presence of water maser emission .",
    "several observational signatures , that we will discuss here , strongly suggest that iras 17347 - 3139 is one of the youngest pne known .",
    "first , the turnover frequency of the radio continuum emission in iras 17347 - 3139 , @xmath40 ghz , is abnormally high as compared with other pne , in which the radio emission is optically thin for frequencies @xmath47 ghz ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "noticeable exceptions are afgl 618 and hb 12 , which have turnover frequencies @xmath48 ghz @xcite and @xmath49 ghz @xcite , respectively .",
    "these objects have been proposed to be very young pn ( @xmath13 yr in the case of afgl 618 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for iras 17347 - 3139 , the high turnover frequency is also consistent with this source being a very young pn , since the high emission measure that it implies is a signature of youth @xcite .",
    "the optical spectrum of iras 17347 - 3139 shows very few lines . of particular interest is the absence of h@xmath50 emission in the spectrum shown in the atlas of @xcite , while all other objects classified as pn and `` transition objects '' in this atlas show this line .",
    "only [ s iii ] at @xmath51    is clearly detected by @xcite .",
    "the absence of optical features in iras 17347 - 3139 can be attributed to an extremely high extinction , which is also evident in its spectral energy distribution ( sed ; fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "the sed of iras 17347 - 3139 shows only a peak , at @xmath52 @xmath53 m , with a sharp decrease toward optical wavelengths .",
    "the fact that this object shows ionization while still keeping a very thick envelope to produce such a strong extinction suggests a very rapid evolution and therefore implies that the progenitor star was relatively massive @xcite .",
    "this is also supported by the bipolar morphology of the nebula ( dg04 ) , since bipolar pne seem to be associated with the evolution of more massive stars than those producing elliptical or spherical pne @xcite .",
    "spectral energy distribution of iras 17347 - 3139 , adapted from @xcite .",
    "the solid line is the optical spectrum .",
    "the squares , asterisks and triangles represent the 2mass , msx , and iras data , respectively .",
    "the diamonds are the atca radio continuum measurements ( this paper ) . ]",
    "it is also interesting that the radio flux density of iras 17347 - 3139 seems to have risen in the 13 years between the vla and atca observations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spin ] ) .",
    "assuming that the opacity of the ionized region has not varied significantly ( the spectral index is similar in both epochs ) , a possible explanation of this increase in flux density could be the expansion of the ionized region . at a frequency of @xmath54 ghz ,",
    "the increase is of a factor of @xmath5 , which would correspond to expansion by a factor of 1.12 in radius in 13 years . at this rate , and assuming a constant expansion velocity , the kinematical age of the ionized region is only @xmath7 yr . the corresponding linear expansion velocity , assuming a radius of @xmath55 , at a distance of @xmath56 kpc would be @xmath8 km s@xmath9 ( @xmath57 au yr@xmath9 ) .",
    "this estimate is consistent with the expansion velocities found in pne ( typically @xmath58 km s@xmath9 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also note that radio brightening has been reported in afgl 618 @xcite , also interpreted as expansion of its associated ionized region .",
    "an increase of the flux density at radio wavelengths is expected in some models of pn evolution @xcite during the first few hundred years , especially for the most massive cases ( see fig .",
    "14 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while the ionized nebula expands but the optical depth is still high .",
    "the evidence we have presented above , indicating that iras 17347 - 3139 is an extremely young pn , is consistent with the presence of water maser emission since water molecules are thought to be destroyed in @xmath13 yr @xcite . given the characteristics found in iras 17347 - 3139",
    ", we have checked for the possible presence of water masers in afgl 618 and hb 12 , to see if a rising radio spectrum at @xmath40 ghz could be an indication of a higher probability of maser emission . since we did not find in the literature any report of water maser observations toward hb 12 , and given that the @xmath59 uppper limit of @xmath60 jy obtained by @xcite towards afgl 618 ( iras 04395 + 3601 ) is relatively high , we took spectra of the 6@xmath615@xmath62 transition of the water molecule ( rest frequency 22235.080 mhz ) , with nasa s 70 m dsn antenna in robledo de chavela ( spain ) , on 2005 may 20 , toward these two pne .",
    "these spectra show no emission , with 3@xmath63 upper limits of 160 mjy between @xmath64 -128.9 and + 86.9 km s@xmath9 for afgl 618 , and 130 mjy between @xmath64 -112.7 and + 103.0 km s@xmath9 for hb 12 ( with a velocity resolution of 0.56 km s@xmath9 in both cases ) .",
    "we note that k3 - 35 , the other pn known to show water maser emission @xcite , does not have a rising spectrum at this frequency ( its turnover frequency is @xmath23 ghz ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) nor a strongly obscured optical spectrum ( it shows emission of h@xmath50 and other prominent optical lines ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which could indicate that this source may be in a later evolutionary stage than iras 17347 - 3139 .",
    "all the unusual characteristics of iras 17347 - 3139 suggest that this could be one of the youngest ( @xmath65 year ) pne known , and therefore , it is one of the most appropriate objects to further study the early stages of this phase of stellar evolution , together with other pne with rising spectra at high radio frequencies .",
