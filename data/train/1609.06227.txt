    "<S> as the impurity location approaches the edge , the bound states will hybridize with the continuum of edge states , leading to the anti - resonances in the transmission coefficient .    in the following </S>",
    "<S> , we shall construct a 1d low - energy effective model that describes the edge channels in the presence of the bs impurity at large @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is bulk band gap . </S>",
    "<S> the effective model is valid at energies and temperatures smaller than @xmath92 and therefore only involves the edge degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the construction of the effective low energy model is aided by using the known symmetries of the system hamiltonian , @xmath16 , as both share the same symmetries . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we note that the km model in the strip geometry , @xmath93 , is invariant under trs ( @xmath94 ) , spin rotations about the @xmath95-axis ( i.e. @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) , particle - hole symmetry ( @xmath98 ) , and translations by multiples of @xmath99 along the edge direction . </S>",
    "<S> the impurity potential , @xmath100 , breaks all those symmetries , but the composite system described by @xmath101 is invariant under the subgroup span by the combined @xmath102 and @xmath103 transformations . therefore , according to the above discussion , the effective model takes the form of a fano model  @xcite describing two discrete levels coupled to the continuum of edge states , which is invariant under @xmath102 and @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> since for @xmath104 the position of the resonances approaches the center of the band gap at @xmath105 , we shall focus in the neighborhood of @xmath106 , where linearization the edge state spectrum , i.e. @xmath107 , is a good approximation . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the effective hamiltonian reads @xmath108 + h_{-}\\left[d , t_{-}\\psi(0)\\right],\\label{eq : hameff}\\\\ h_b & = iv_f \\int dx\\ :   \\psi^{\\dagger } s^{z } \\partial_x\\psi + v_{b}a_{0}\\psi^{\\dagger}(0)s^{x}\\psi(0 ) , \\label{eq : hamb}\\\\ h_{\\pm}&[f,\\chi ] = \\pm \\epsilon_0\\ : \\left ( f^{\\dag } f -\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right ) + v_{c}a^{1/2}_{0 } \\left [ f^{\\dagger } \\chi + \\mathrm{h.c . } \\right ] \\ ] ] where @xmath109 is the spinor field operator describing the edge states , @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the creation operators of electrons in the bound states with @xmath89 eigenvalue and energy @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively , and @xmath114 ; @xmath115 is a short distance cut - off . in the above model , @xmath116 describes a renormalized bs amplitude for the edge electrons , and @xmath117 the tunneling into and out of the bound states . </S>",
    "<S> the reflection coefficient for the effective model reads : @xmath118 we have fitted the numerical results for the impurity system interacting with the edge of a 2dti to this equation , as shown on the left panel of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> as expected from the above discussion , @xmath122 decreases as @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> note also that @xmath124 . in passing , </S>",
    "<S> we note that for @xmath125 , the resonances disappear and the the reflection coefficient becomes independent of the energy , which applies to an impurity located on the first atomic row ( @xmath78 ) .     </S>",

    "<S> interactions will be treated non - perturbatively using the bosonization method  @xcite , and their characteristic energy scale @xmath128 ( where @xmath129 is the electron charge ) is assumed to be smaller than @xmath126 . </S>",

    "<S> \\label{eq : hamkf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have also accounted for interactions between the edge electrons ( with amplitude @xmath140 ) and with the resonant level electron ( with amplitudes @xmath141 and @xmath142 ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , integrating out the non - resonant level at @xmath143 modifies the bs potential @xmath144 in @xmath145 by an amount @xmath146 . </S>",
    "<S> forward scattering is also generated but it has been dropped since it can be eliminated by a unitary transformation  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian in @xmath145 in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> is very similar to a model of side - coupled level to an interacting 1d channel , which has been studied by goldstein and berkovits in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . following these authors , after bosonizing  @xcite eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , we apply a unitary transformation and eliminate the forward interaction term @xmath147 , at the expense of renormalizing the scaling dimension ( @xmath148 ) of the tunneling , @xmath149 , where @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the imaginary time and @xmath152 $ ] , where @xmath153 is the luttinger parameter and @xmath154 the velocity of the edge plasmons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> tunneling into the resonant state becomes relevant in the renormalization - group ( rg ) sense when @xmath155 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for weak to moderate repulsion ( i.e @xmath156 ) , both tunneling @xmath117 and the bs ( @xmath157 ) renormalize to strong coupling and suppress the transmission across the impurity , as confirmed by the rg flows to 2nd order  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , for moderate attraction ( i.e. @xmath158 ) , for which bs is _ navely _ irrelevant  @xcite , we have @xmath159 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , tunneling flows to strong coupling and 2nd order rg flows  @xcite show that the runaway flow of @xmath117 drags along @xmath142 and @xmath141 , which leads to the narrowing of the anti - resonance in the transmission and suppression of conductance as @xmath3 , also for weak to moderate attraction in the edge channel .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated the problem of an impurity inducing backscattering at the edge of a two - dimensional topological insulator ( ti ) . by obtaining a solution of the scattering problem , </S>",
    "<S> we have derived the 1d effective low - energy hamiltonian describing the system . </S>",
    "<S> strong backscattering induces two discrete levels within the band gap , which couple to the ( interacting ) metallic edge(s ) . when the fermi energy resonates with one of the levels , both moderately attractive or repulsive interactions </S>",
    "<S> suppress the transmission through the impurity . off resonance , the system can be effectively described as an impurity in a tomonaga - luttinger liquid  @xcite with a renormalized backscattering potential . </S>",
    "<S> this picture should be robust in the presence of weak uniform rashba spin - orbit , which will introduce an energy dependence in the couplings of the effective model , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , arising from the spin texture of the bulk and edge states . however , energy dependence is an irrelevant perturbation at low energies . besides this , other model regimes and extensions to this work , such as multiple impurity problems , etc . will be explored elsewhere  @xcite .    </S>",
