    "these equations admit an integral of motion , the well known jacobi integral @xmath5 and are invariant under the symmetries @xmath6 although the circular hill problem ( ch ) has only two degrees of freedom and is , moreover , autonomous , conservative and parameter free , it is not integrable ( meletlidou et al . , 2001 ; morales - ruiz et al . , 2005",
    ") and shows rich dynamics , which are depicted by computing poincar surfaces of section ( hnon , 1970 ; chauvineau and mignard , 1991 ) .",
    "a detailed study of the ch problem has been given by hnon ( 1969,1970 ) .",
    "he found the main families of periodic orbits , explored the phase space by using poincar sections and computed the width of the stability regions .",
    "as we know , the families of periodic orbits consist the backbone of the phase space .",
    "the most important of them are presented in fig .",

    "[ figchfams ] that families of periodic orbits of retrograde satellites extend to distances much larger than the hill radius and , interestingly , some of them are stable .",
    "the hill s approximation can be applied in the same way to the spatial problem ( hnon , 1974 ) .",
    "such a model has been used in space mission orbit design ( villac , 2003 , 2008 ) . a single averaged model for the spatial hill s",
    "problem has been also studied , providing particular solutions ( see vashkovyak and teslenko ( 2008 ) and references therein ) .",
    "hill models have also been derived for the case of binary satellites or asteroids ( hnon and petit , 1986 ; chauvineau and mignard , 1990 ) . in these models",
    "the center of mass of the binary moves along a circular orbit around the sun . a model where the center of the binary moves in an elliptic orbit has been given by moons et al .",
    "this model uses a different formalism and aims to the study of the changes of orbital elements due to close encounters .",
    "an extensive list of references on the dynamics of satellite motion is given in waldvogel ( 1999 ) .",
    "the general three body problem may be also used for studying satellite or binary motion ( hadjidemetriou and voyatzis , 2011 ) .",
    "the elliptic hill ( eh ) model can be derived by considering the same hill s approximation assumptions used in the ch model , but letting the planet move on an elliptic orbit around the sun .",
    "such a model has been introduced by ichtiaroglou ( 1980 , 1981 ) who also computed a few families of periodic orbits . a further study ( ichtiaroglou and voyatzis , 1990 ) showed that all periodic orbits found were strongly unstable .",
    "it is obvious that the eh is a more appropriate model than the ch for studying the dynamics of a small satellite around a planet ( or an asteroid ) with eccentric motion .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study the dynamics of the eh problem in more detail , focusing on the main qualitative features of the phase space and orbit evolution .    in the next section",

    "in section [ secfamilies ] we present the results of the computations of families of periodic orbits , giving particular attention to the stable ones . in section 4",

    "the elliptic hill s model is an extension of the famous circular hill s model .",
    "it is obtained by applying the classical hill s transformation to the equations of the elliptic restricted three body problem in a rotating frame . in this paper",
    "we studied the main qualitative features of its dynamics by computing ( i ) families of periodic orbits and their stability and ( ii ) stability maps for the determination of regions with regular orbits .",
    "the families of periodic orbits in the eh model bifurcate from the families of the ch model and continue with parameter the planetary eccentricity , @xmath52 .",
    "we can define an infinite set of bifurcation points on the ch families ( @xmath42 ) by increasing the multiplicity of the periodic orbits .",
    "we have determined a large set of bifurcation points that correspond mainly to stable periodic orbits , since we are interested in locating stable families . for each bifurcation point",
    "we computed the family of periodic orbits by varying the planetary eccentricity , @xmath52 .",
    "we classified the families according to their resonance and discussed their structure .",
    "we found that most of the families extend up to high absolute @xmath52 values for both the periapsis and the apoapsis case .",
    "however , in some cases the eh families reach a maximum value of @xmath164 , where a saddle - node bifurcation takes place .",
    "then a new eh family is generated , which also meet a bifurcation point on a ch family .",
    "nevertheless , there may exist eh families that do not originate from critical points of the circular problem , but such families can not be computed by the approximation followed in this paper .",
    "most of the families are found to start as unstable , but in many cases family segments exist having stable periodic orbits even for relatively high absolute eccentricity values ( @xmath165 ) . generally , continuing the families for @xmath38 and @xmath39 we find that at least one case gives simply unstable orbits .",
    "an exception is the family @xmath105 , which in both cases starts as stable .",
    "family segments of double and complex instability also exist .    in order to determine the phase space regions of regular orbits",
    ", we computed maps of dynamical stability defined on various planes .",
    "the majority of initial conditions corresponds to orbits that are irregular - chaotic and finally escape .",
    "however , the hnon stability maps showed that around the stable families @xmath62 and @xmath63 of the ch model there exist wide regions of regular motion .",
    "as the planetary eccentricity increases , the stability regions are affected significantly only when the planet is at apoapsis for @xmath40 .",
    "prograde orbits are affected more than retrograde ones .",
    "the stable periodic orbits of the eh model are located at the `` centers '' of phase space regions with regular orbits . instead , unstable periodic orbits are associated with chaotic orbits in their vicinity . for large absolute eccentricity values",
    "such chaotic orbits escape after a few planetary revolutions .",
    "for @xmath166 the chaotic regions around the unstable periodic orbits are thin and are surrounded by regions of regular orbits . in these regions the orbits are trapped and do not escape , at least for relatively long time spans ."
