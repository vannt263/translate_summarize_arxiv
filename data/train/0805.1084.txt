    "after the rediscovery in the early 1950s of spatial coincidences between cepheids and open clusters by @xcite , eggen ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xcite , a number of searches for additional coincidences were made by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , among others .",
    "tifft s search resulted in the discovery of a near spatial coincidence between the 4@xmath1.37 cepheid cg cassiopeiae and an anonymous open cluster , subsequently catalogued as berkeley 58 @xcite , which lies less than one cluster diameter to the west .",
    "the field is coincident with a portion of the perseus spiral arm that is relatively rich in open clusters , and the cluster ngc 7790 with its three cepheid members lies in close proximity .",
    "the possibility that cg cas might be an outlying member of ngc 7790 was raised at one time by @xcite , and found some support in a star count analysis by @xcite .",
    "more detailed star counts in the field @xcite indicate otherwise , as do the available proper motion data @xcite .",
    "the cepheid does lie in the corona of berkeley 58 @xcite , although frolov has argued that it is not a probable cluster member .    given a probable distance of  3 kpc to both cg cas and",
    "berkeley 58 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is not clear that existing proper motion data are precise enough to provide conclusive evidence pertaining to the cluster membership of cg cas .",
    "the present study was therefore initiated in order to examine the case in more detail . as demonstrated here",
    ", there is strong evidence that cg cas is a likely member of berkeley 58 and that it can serve as a calibrator for the cepheid period - luminosity ( pl ) relation .",
