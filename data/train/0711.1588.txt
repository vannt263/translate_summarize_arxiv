    "the processes that govern the conversion of gas to stars in galaxies are complicated and poorly understood .",
    "nonetheless , there do exist empirical star formation recipes which are widely applied to models of galaxy evolution .",
    "typically , these recipes allow one to compute a global star formation rate given the gas column density or , alternatively , some estimate of the dynamical timescale ( e.g. the angular rotation frequency @xmath9 ) .",
    "while the existence of such empirical relationships is fairly well established in large galaxies ( e.g. kennicutt 1998 ) , it is unclear whether these are applicable to the smallest dwarf galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , star formation in such small galaxies is of particular interest in studies of galaxy formation , because , in hierarchical models of galaxy formation , small galaxies form first and then merge to form larger galaxies .",
    "nearby , metal poor dwarf galaxies are , in this sense , analogs of first units of star formation in the universe .",
    "detailed studies ( at resolutions that are not achievable for high redshift objects ) of the star formation in nearby dwarf galaxies could hence give some insight into the star formation processes occurring in primordial galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "we have been conducting a systematic multi - wavelength survey ( the faint irregular galaxy gmrt survey  figgs ( @xcite ) of nearby dwarf galaxies .",
    "this survey revealed the truly unusual properties of ngc  3741 , with an hi disk that extends to more than @xmath18 times its holmberg radius ( @xcite , henceforth paper  i ) .",
    "ngc  3741 has the most extended gas disk known .",
    "further , with the observed m@xmath10 , ngc  3741 is also one of the most gas - rich dwarf galaxies known . in paper  i we presented a rotation curve for ngc  3741 that extended out to @xmath11 optical b band scale lengths ( bremnes et al . 2000 ) and showed that within the last measured point of the rotation curve , the dark matter in ngc  3741 contributes to 92 % of its total dynamical mass , whereas stars contribute only 1% of the total mass . on the other hand",
    ", we also found that its total baryonic ( i.e. hi + stellar mass ) to dark matter ratio of @xmath12 falls within the range that is typical of galaxies ( @xmath13 ; paper  i ) .",
    "ngc  3741 thus seems to be a case of inefficient star formation , that is worthy of further study .    in this paper",
    "we present new hi and h@xmath0 data for ngc  3741 .",
    "we also estimate the gas - phase oxygen abundance of this galaxy using the spectrophotometric data from @xcite .",
    "we use these data to study the the relationship between gas and star formation and abundance properties of this very gas - rich galaxy . throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt a distance of 3.03 mpc , as derived from the tip of the red giant branch ( karachentsev et al .",
    "2003 ) . at this distance 1@xmath14 corresponds to 14.7 pc .",
    "hi observations of ngc  3741 were conducted at the gmrt ( giant metrewave radio telescope ) , drao ( dominion radio astrophysical observatory ) synthesis telescope and wsrt ( westerbork synthesis radio telescope ) .",
    "a combination of the data from these arrays provides sensitivity to the large - scale , low surface brightness component which could have been missed with the gmrt observations alone , because of missing short spacings at the gmrt .",
    "the gmrt observations have been described in detail in paper  i. here we only note that the final visibility set had 128 spectral channels spread across a 1 mhz bandwidth , i.e. a channel spacing of @xmath15  kms@xmath5 .",
    "the drao observations were made in a `` complete survey '' mode ( landecker ( 2000 ) ) .",
    "twelve sets of spacings were used , giving baselines from 12.9 to 604.3 m at 4.3 m intervals .",
    "the drao data contained 256 spectral channels across a 1 mhz bandwidth , or a channel separation of @xmath16  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the wsrt observations consisted of a single 12hr observing run in the `` maxi - short '' configuration taken on 09@xmath17 oct , 2005 .",
    "there were a total of 2048 spectral channels across a 10 mhz bandwidth , for a channel separation of @xmath18  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the flux calibration was performed using an observations of 3c147 , while phase calibration was done using self - calibration on the continuum sources in the field .    a low resolution",
    "@xmath19 image was made from combining the gmrt , wsrt and drao data .",
    "this image was made as follows .",
    "after continuum subtraction ( using aips ( astronomical image processing systems ) task uvsub ) the gmrt , drao and wsrt visibility data were exported to miriad where they were regridded onto a common velocity scale using the task `` uvaver '' .",
    "the channel width after regridding was 2.0 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the regridded visibility data were read back into aips and clean cubes were made from each data set using the task imagr .",
    "the uv range and taper were adjusted for each data set , so as to give a circular beam of @xmath20 resolution .",
    "the clean cubes were then corrected for the primary beam attenuation appropriate for each telescope using the task pbcor in aips .",
    "these primary beam corrected cubes were then combined ( using the weights determined by the rms noise in each cube ) to a final combined data cube .",
    "since the rms noises in the drao , gmrt and wsrt cubes was 13.6 mjy , 5.5 mjy and 0.96 mjy respectively , the weighted sum is dominated by the wsrt data .",
    "emission in the combined cube is seen over the velocity range 166 @xmath3 293.7 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "in contrast , in the gmrt data alone , emission is detectable only over the range 180.0 @xmath3 283.7 km  s@xmath5 . in paper",
    "i we only presented a @xmath21 resolution image made from the gmrt data .",
    "however since the gmrt has a hybrid configuration , higher resolution images can also be made from the same data .",
    "here we present both @xmath22 and @xmath23 resolution images made from the same data .",
    "the rms noise in these data cubes is 1.6 mjy and 1.1 mjy respectively .",

    "the galaxy was observed with a kron - cousins @xmath24 filter , with an integration time of 200  s. details of the observation and data reduction procedures can be found in lee ( 2006 ) and kennicutt et al .",

    "the processed narrow - band images contain contributions both from h@xmath0 and [ nii ] line emission as well as underlying stellar continuum ( including h@xmath0 absorption ) .",
    "net emission - line images were obtained by subtracting a scaled @xmath24 image from the narrow - band image , aligning the respective images using foreground stars .",
    "additional small corrections for line emission in the @xmath24-band image and the wavelength shift between filters were applied , as described in lee ( 2006 ) and kennicutt et al .",
    "finally a small correction for [ nii ] contamination in the image was applied using an integrated spectrum of the galaxy obtained by moustakas & kennicutt ( 2006 ) .",
    "the derived total h@xmath0 luminosity for ngc  3741 is @xmath25 erg s@xmath5 , which corresponds to a star formation rate ( sfr ) of 3.4@xmath26 m@xmath4yr@xmath5 ( using the conversion factor from @xcite ) .",

    "[ fig : overlay ] with the @xmath21 map made using only the gmrt data ( in figure 1[a ] of paper  i ) , we find that using the combined data set from wsrt , gmrt and drao , we could recover the faint , more extended outer envelope of hi distribution .",
    "the hi envelope extends to @xmath34 , at a level of @xmath35 cm@xmath6 i.e. @xmath1  8.8 times the holmberg diameter , compared to @xmath37 times the holmberg diameter measured with the gmrt data alone .    in paper",

    "a presence of an hi bar is also evident in the high resolution velocity field ( figure  [ fig : mom1][b ] here and figure.1[b ] in paper  i ) from the oval distortion of the isovelocity contours in the center of the galaxy .",
    "further , gentile et al.(2007 ) also found evidence for a bar at the centre of this galaxy based on a harmonic decomposition of the velocity field . on the other hand , near infra - red images of this galaxy",

    "hi map is @xmath310@xmath75 deg and 0.65@xmath40 .",
    "thus , while the optical morphology of ngc  3741 implies a disk structure ( vaduvescu et al.(2005 ) ) , our hi data suggest a bar configuration in the center of the galaxy .",

    "for ngc  3741 log([nii]/[oii])@xmath52 , hence the low - abundance branch of the model grid of the r@xmath51 relation from mcgaugh ( 1991 ) was considered .",

    "the oxygen abundance derived using the bright line calibration was hence found to be 12 + log(o / h)= 7.66@xmath70.10 .",
    "the uncertainty in this estimate also includes the uncertainty in the model calibrations of the semiemperical relation between line strength and elemental abundance for log(o / h ) ( mcgaugh 1991 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : metal - lumin ] shows the absolute b magnitude for ngc  3741 , plotted against the derived oxygen abundance .",

    "the solid line with the slope and intercept of ( @xmath30.11@xmath70.01 , 6.24@xmath70.16 ) respectively , shows the best fit to the data .",
    "as can be seen ngc  3741 follows the metallicity - luminosity relation as defined by other dwarf galaxies .",
    "we will now compare the derived oxygen abundance and gas fraction of ngc  3741 with expectations from the closed - box chemical evolution in galaxies . in a closed - box model the baryonic gas mass fraction @xmath53 ( the ratio of the gas mass to the total mass in gas and stars ) and the gas - phase abundance ( z ) are related as    @xmath54    -0.70cmwhere p is the elemental yield by mass .",
    "the effective yield , p@xmath55 , is defined as the yield that would be deduced if the galaxy was assumed to be a simple closed - box . in order to compute @xmath53 for estimating p@xmath55",
    ", we need to know the amount of gas that could participate in star formation . for galaxies with extended hi disks whether to compute @xmath53 using the entire hi mass or just the hi mass within the optical disk is an important issue ( garnett 2002 ) .",
    "we computed p@xmath55 for the two limiting cases i.e. ( i ) using the entire hi mass and ( ii ) using only the hi mass within the optical disk . the effective yield of oxygen for ngc  3741 , using the entire hi mass , is found to be p@xmath56 ( derived using the parameters in table .  [ tab : par ] ) . in the model used by vanzee & haynes ( 2006 ) ( henceforth vh06 ) , this yield is consistent ( within the errorbars ) with the theoretically expected closed - box yield of p=0.0074 ( meynet & maeder , 2002 ) .",
    "on the other hand , using only the hi mass within the optical disk , the derived p@xmath57 is much lower than that expected from closed - box chemical evolution .",
    "if interpreted literally , the above exercise would suggest that ngc  3741 is evolving as a closed - box model , provided that the gas - phase metallicity in the inner disk is the same as the outer disk , i.e. that there is an efficient mixing of the metals throughout the hi disk .",
    "however this seems unlikely , given the large size of the hi disk .",
    "tassis et al .",
    "( 2006 ) showed that the mixing length of metals in a galaxy increases with a decrease in the galaxy mass .",
    "however , whether there is mixing of metals even up to 14 times its optical extent is unclear . on the other hand",
    ", what evidence do we have for closed - box chemical evolution in dwarf galaxies ? and can one from the observational data try to make inferences about how much of the hi disk participates in the chemical evolution ( i.e. is well mixed ) ?",
    "the gravitational binding energy of faint dwarf irregular galaxies is not much larger than the energy output from a few supernovae , hence a priori , one might expect that low mass galaxies would depart from the closed - box chemical evolution , since enriched material could escape via stellar winds and supernova ejecta ( brooks et al .",
    "we searched the literature for the hi interferometric images for the galaxies in vh06 sample and show in fig .",
    "[ fig : overlay_yield][a ] the effective yield plotted as a function of the hi extent of a sample of galaxies in vh06 sample with available hi images ( the sources of the hi images is given in the figure caption ) .",
    "the effective yield is computed by considering the entire gas mass .",
    "ngc  3741 and ddo154 are shown in the plot with extreme values of the hi extent . as can be seen",
    ", there are some galaxies in the sample which are consistent with the closed - box model .",
    "however there is no clear trend seen between the effective yield and the extent of the hi disk .",
    "figure  [ fig : overlay_yield][b ] shows the effective yield for the same sample of galaxies as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : overlay_yield][a ] , however this time the effective yield is computed by considering the gas fraction within the holmberg radius .",
    "as can be seen , if the effective yield is computed within the holmberg radius , ( as would be appropriate in the case of inefficient mixing ) none of these galaxies follow a closed - box model .",
    "the theoretically expected closed - box chemical yield depends on assumptions about the imf , stellar rotation as well as in details of stellar evolution models ( meynet & maeder , 2002 ) .",
    "it may be more instructive hence to look for trends in the effective yield as a function of other galaxy properties , instead of comparing the observed yield against a model dependent expected yield .",
    "one possible parameter to use for such a correlation is the total dynamical mass .",
    "vh06 did not find any significant trend between the dynamical mass and effective yield for the galaxies in their sample , however they computed the dynamical mass using the hi global velocity widths .",
    "we recomputed the dynamical masses for the galaxies in vh06 sample for which rotation curves are available in literature .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : yield_mass ] a plot of the effective yield against the total dynamical mass .",
    "the effective yield computed using the entire hi mass is shown as cross , while the effective yield computed using the hi mass within the holmberg radius is shown as solid points . as can be seen , in both cases the effective yield increases with increasing dynamical mass .",
    "the correlation is tighter if one uses the only hi mass within the holmberg radius ( correlation coefficient is 0.59 ) compared to using the entire hi mass ( correlation coefficient is 0.47 ) , suggesting that , if this model were to be correct , only the gas within the optical disk participates in the chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "however we note that the total number of galaxies in our analysis is too small to make any statistical conclusion .",
    "spectroscopic observations of a large sample of dwarf galaxies along with a knowledge of the gas distribution is hence required for a better understanding of chemical enrichment and mixing of enriched material in gas - rich , low mass galaxies .    in summary",
    ", we examine the dark and luminous matter in ngc  3741 .",
    "although this galaxy has one of the highest known ratios of dark to luminous ( i.e. stellar ) matter , its baryons to dark matter ratio is typical of that of galaxies . in its global star formation properties",
    "however , the galaxy appears to follow the trends defined by other dwarf galaxies .",
    "given the large observed scatter about these mean trends , it is perhaps not very surprising that ngc  3741 is not very markedly discrepant .",
    "finally we examine the issue of chemical evolution via a closed - box model .",
    "the effective oxygen yield of ngc  3741 is that expected from theoretical models , provided one assumes that there is efficient mixing of the gas @xmath58 times further than the end of the optical disk .",
    "this seems apriori unlikely . on the other hand , using a sample of galaxies with both interferometric hi maps and chemical abundance measurements , we find that the effective yield is anti - correlated with the total dynamical mass , as expected in leaky box models .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of hi , h@xmath0 , and oxygen abundance data for ngc  3741 . </S>",
    "<S> this galaxy has a very extended gas disk ( @xmath1 8.8 times the holmberg radius ) , and a dark to luminous ( i.e. stellar ) mass ratio of @xmath2 , which makes it one of the `` darkest '' dwarf irregular galaxies known </S>",
    "<S> . however its ratio of baryons ( i.e. gas + stellar ) mass to dark mass is typical of that in galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our new high - resolution hi images of the galaxy show evidence for a large scale ( purely gaseous ) spiral arm and central bar . from our hi data , </S>",
    "<S> a rotation curve can be derived out to @xmath1 37@xmath3 44 disk scale lengths in the j and b band respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this is just slightly short of the radius at which one would expect an nfw type rotation curve to start falling . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy has an integrated star formation rate of @xmath1 0.0034 m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 , while the average star formation rate within the optical disk is @xmath1 0.0049 m@xmath4  yr@xmath5  kpc@xmath6 . despite the gaseous spiral feature and the on - going star formation , we find that the global gas density in ngc  3741 is significantly lower than the toomre instability criterion . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the behaviour seen in other dwarf galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the star formation rate is consistent with that expected from the observed correlations between hi mass and sfr and the global kennicutt - schmidt law respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the oxygen abundance to be 12 + log(o / h)=7.66@xmath70.10 , which is consistent with that expected from the metallicity - luminosity relation , despite its extreme gas mass ratio . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the issue of chemical evolution of ngc  3741 in the context of closed - box model of chemical evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the effective oxygen yield of ngc  3741 is consistent with recent model estimates of closed - box yields , provided one assumes that the gas has been efficiently mixed all the way to edge of the hi disk ( i.e. @xmath8 times the optical radius ) . </S>",
    "<S> this seems a priori unlikely . on the other hand , using a sample of galaxies with both interferometric hi maps and chemical abundance measurements , we find that the effective yield is anti - correlated with the total dynamical mass , as expected in leaky box models .    </S>",
