    "it s therefore of interest to determine which knots are simple in both senses .",
    "that is , which knots have both tunnel number one and genus one .",

    "this theorem is useful because of the historical background : @xmath0-bridge knots all have tunnel number one and those of genus one are easily described ( cf ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 12.25 ) ) and , indeed , they are easily pictured : see figure [ fig:2bridge ] .",
    "on the other hand , morimoto and sakuma @xcite and independently eudave - muoz @xcite classified all satellite knots which have tunnel number one .",
    "these knots have a concrete description and can be naturally indexed by a @xmath18-tuple of integers . in @xcite , goda and teragaito determined which of these satellite knots have genus one and made the conjecture that these knots complete the list of knots that have both genus one and tunnel number one .",

    "a special case of this proposition is independently useful :    [ cor : uchida ] suppose @xmath12 is an unknotting tunnel for @xmath13 and @xmath12 lies on a genus one seifert surface @xmath16 for @xmath13",

    "@xmath12 ca nt be parallel to a subarc of @xmath13 , else @xmath13 would itself be unknotted .",

    "then @xmath62 is an incompressible annulus @xmath56 that satisfies the hypotheses of proposition [ prop : uchida ] .",
    "the last proposition and its corollary begin to suggest a strategy for trying to prove the conjecture : let @xmath63 .",
    "try to arrange that @xmath12 is disjoint from a genus one seifert surface @xmath16 for @xmath13 , so that we can think of @xmath16 as lying in the closed complement @xmath36 of @xmath64 in @xmath6 .",
    "this makes @xmath65 a useful copy of @xmath13 lying on @xmath23 .",
    "try to show that some boundary - compressing disk for @xmath16 in @xmath36 crosses a meridian of @xmath12 exactly once or , alternatively , is disjoint from a meridian corresponding to one of the two edges @xmath66 .",
    "if the former happens then , with some work , @xmath12 can be isotoped onto @xmath16 and corollary [ cor : uchida ] applies .",
    "if the latter happens then we can invoke proposition [ prop : uchida ] .",
    "such a strategy requires an understanding of potential boundary - compressing disks for @xmath16 in @xmath36 , once @xmath12 is made disjoint from @xmath16 .",
    "a natural source for such disks are the outermost disks cut off by @xmath16 from meridians of the handlebody @xmath36 .",
    "that is , if @xmath57 is a meridian disk of @xmath36 , then an outermost arc of @xmath67 in @xmath57 cuts off a disk @xmath68 .",
    "moreover , @xmath68 lies on one side of @xmath16 , so the arc @xmath69 has both ends incident to the same side of @xmath13 .",
    "consider the meridians @xmath70 of @xmath20 corresponding to the two edges of @xmath63 coming from @xmath13 and the meridian @xmath71 coming from the edge @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath72 is disjoint from either of the meridians @xmath70 then we are done by proposition [ prop : uchida ] .",
    "if @xmath72 intersects both these meridians , then some subarc @xmath73 of @xmath72 cut off by @xmath70 is an arc in the @xmath18-punctured sphere @xmath74 running from a copy of @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "arcs in a @xmath18-punctured sphere are easy to understand  each roughly corresponds to a rational number given by its slope , viewing the @xmath18-punctured sphere as a pillowcase with holes in the corners",
    ". see figure [ fig : pillowslope ] since @xmath73 is disjoint from the vertical ( i. e. slope @xmath77 ) arcs @xmath78 , it determines a non - zero integral slope which ( by appropriate choice of slope @xmath79 ) we may take to be @xmath26 . in other words",
    ", we are done unless the meridian disks of @xmath36 intersect the @xmath18-punctured sphere @xmath74 in arcs of one particular slope .",
    "of course the genus two handlebody @xmath36 has many meridians , so it seems that it would be difficult to say much about the slopes of arcs determined by these meridians .",
    "but it is a remarkable fact ( see @xcite ) that , if we restrict to simple closed curves in @xmath23 that bound meridians in both @xmath20 and @xmath36 , the slope is determined ( up to only a small ambiguity ) by @xmath13 and @xmath12 , as long as @xmath13 is not @xmath0-bridge .",
    "we are done anyway if @xmath13 is @xmath0-bridge , so the upshot is that right from the beginning there is only one troublesome case to deal with  when the slope given by a meridian of @xmath36 , a meridian whose boundary also bounds a meridian of @xmath57 , is simply @xmath26 .",
    "the argument here is more rigorously presented in @xcite ( where what we here call the `` slope '' is there the invariant @xmath80 ) .",
    "this completes the proof of the goda - teragaito conjecture for all but the case @xmath81 .",
    "but this final case seems to require a substantial broadening of our strategy which we now describe .",
    "roughly , we start with @xmath82 but find simpler and simpler spines for @xmath20 , allowing @xmath13 to appear more complex on @xmath23 with respect to these simpler spines .",
    "the hope is to do this in such a controlled manner that much of the argument above can still be applied and , moreover , the process does not stop until one of the cycles in the spine is the unknot .",
    "the notion of thin position for knots goes back to early work of gabai ( @xcite ) . in outline ,",
    "the idea is this : think of @xmath6 as swept out by an interval s worth of @xmath0-spheres .",
    "more concretely , choose a height function @xmath83 $ ] with exactly two critical points : a maximum and a minimum at heights @xmath84 .",
    "it is possible to associate a natural number , called the _ width _ , to any generic positioning of a knot @xmath13 in @xmath6 .",
    "this can be done so that the width is unchanged by isotopies of @xmath13 that do not create or destroy critical points or change the ordering of the heights of the critical points .",
    "in fact , width stays unchanged if the height of two adjacent maxima or two adjacent minima are switched .",
    "it will go down if a maximum is pushed below a minimum or a maximum and a minimum are cancelled . when the width is minimized , the knot is said to be in _",
    "thin position_.    to illustrate the usefulness of thin position , consider a knot @xmath85 in thin position and suppose @xmath16 is an incompressible seifert surface for @xmath13 .",
    "suppose some level @xmath0-sphere @xmath86 ( ie @xmath87 ) is transverse to @xmath16 and among the components of @xmath88 are a pair of disks , say cut off by arc components of @xmath89 , one disk lying above @xmath86 and one below @xmath86",
    ". then those disks would describe a way to simultaneously push a maximum of @xmath13 below @xmath86 and a minimum of @xmath13 above @xmath86 , reducing the width .",
    "we conclude that no such pair of disks occurs .    on the other hand ,",
    "as we imagine level spheres @xmath90 sweeping across @xmath16 from top to bottom , at first there must be a disk cut off from @xmath16 that lies above @xmath91 and just before the end of the sweep there must be a disk from @xmath16 that lies below @xmath91 . since there ca nt simultaneously be both types of disks , as we have just seen , there must be some height at which there are no disks of either type , so in fact for @xmath86 at this height , all components of @xmath92 are essential in @xmath16",
    ".    if @xmath16 is of genus one , then essential @xmath26-manifolds in @xmath16 are easy to describe .",
    "for example , if all components of the @xmath26-manifold are arcs then these arcs lie in at most three different parallelism classes .    in @xcite",
    "we presented a similar notion of thin position that works well for trivalent graphs in @xmath6 .",
    "that is , just as for knots , it is possible to define the width of a generic positioning of a trivalent graph @xmath4 in @xmath6 in such a way that the width is unchanged by isotopies of @xmath13 that do not create or destroy critical points or change the ordering of the heights of the critical points , where here `` critical point '' is enlarged to include vertices of the graph .",
    "moreover , and this is the delicate point , the width stays unchanged if the height of two adjacent maxima or two adjacent minima are switched . here",
    "the delicacy arises because the maxima ( and minima ) can be of two different types : one type is the standard maximum of an arc , but the second type is that of a @xmath93-vertex , i. e. a vertex incident to two ends of edges lying below it and one above .",
    "the last crucial property of the width is that , just as in the case of knots , the width of @xmath4 will go down if a maximum is pushed below a minimum or a maximum and a minimum are cancelled , or a @xmath93-vertex and adjacent standard minimum become a @xmath94-vertex ( or , symmetrically , a @xmath94-vertex and adjacent standard maximum become a @xmath93-vertex ) . to summarize briefly :",
    "if @xmath4 is in thin position then , without affecting width , minima can be pushed past other minima and maxima past other maxima but no maximum can be pushed below any minimum .",
    "it turns out that any theta - curve heegaard spine in @xmath6 has a useful property when it is put in thin position .",
    "a trivalent graph @xmath1 is in _ bridge position _ with respect to a height function @xmath95 $ ] if there is a level sphere @xmath96 so that all maxima of @xmath4 lie above @xmath86 and all minima lie below .",
    "such a sphere @xmath86 is called a _ dividing sphere_.    @xcite [ theorem : levelspine ] suppose @xmath7 is a theta - curve heegaard spine that is in thin position in @xmath6 .",
    "then @xmath9 is in bridge position and some edge of @xmath4 is disjoint from a dividing sphere .    with this in mind , we try to extend the application of thin position given above to the following : suppose @xmath9 is a theta - curve heegaard spine with regular neighborhood @xmath20 and the seifert surface @xmath16 is properly embedded in @xmath97 .",
    "suppose @xmath9 is in thin position and @xmath13 does nt `` back - track '' along any edge in @xmath9 .",
    "that is , @xmath13 does nt intersect twice in a row the meridian corresponding to any one edge of @xmath9 .",
    "then , just as in the case for thin position of knots , there is a level sphere @xmath86 that intersects @xmath16 only in essential curves .",
    "it turns out that the following example of this situation ( the motivation will come a bit later ) is crucial :    [ defin : pq ] suppose @xmath9 is a theta - curve in @xmath6 with edges @xmath98 . in @xmath64 , denote the corresponding meridians by @xmath99 .",
    "suppose @xmath100 is a primitive curve in @xmath23 ( i. e. it intersects some essential disk in @xmath20 in a single point ) and @xmath13 intersects each of the meridians @xmath101 always with the same orientation and so that some minimal genus seifert surface @xmath16 for @xmath13 intersects @xmath20 only in @xmath15 .",
    "arrange the labelling and orientations of the edges and meridians so that , geometrically as well as algebraically ,    * @xmath102 * @xmath103 * @xmath104 .",
    "then we say that @xmath13 ( or @xmath105 ) is presented on @xmath9 as a @xmath106 quasi - cable .",
    "our remarks above then show that if @xmath9 is in thin position and @xmath105 is presented on @xmath9 as a @xmath54 quasi - cable then some level sphere @xmath86 intersects @xmath16 in a @xmath26-manifold that is essential in @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath16 is of genus one then the components of @xmath107 fall into at most three parallelism classes in @xmath16 .",
    "it is not obvious , but is not difficult to show , that this greatly constrains the kind of @xmath54 quasi - cabling that can give rise to genus one surfaces .",
    "most importantly ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.3 ) ) the constraint forces @xmath108 . in the context of the strategy outlined above ( cf .",
    "corollary [ cor : matsuda ] and proposition [ prop : uchida ] ) establishing that a meridian dual to an edge intersects @xmath13 exactly once is a promising development indeed .",
    "indeed , this connection alone suggests that thinking about @xmath13 as a @xmath54 quasi - cable could be quite useful .",
    "next we show why it is not only useful but also perhaps natural to think about @xmath13 as a @xmath54 quasi - cable .",
    "for this we go back to the argument of section [ section : math ] and consider how we might try to apply thin position to the only case ( @xmath81 ) in which the argument of section [ section : math ] fails .",
    "recall that @xmath81 means that for @xmath57 any meridian of @xmath36 , there is an arc @xmath109 running between the pair of meridians @xmath70 such that @xmath73 is disjoint from @xmath13 .",
    "now suppose the theta - graph @xmath63 is put in thin position and , moreover , among all possible ways of sliding @xmath12 on @xmath13 , we ve picked the one that makes @xmath9 thinnest .",
    "we hope to use the thin position argument formerly applied to the seifert surface @xmath16 and see what happens if we apply it instead to the meridian disk @xmath57 .",
    "a first observation is that , following @xcite , we can assume that @xmath19 is in bridge position and that a dividing sphere is disjoint from the tunnel @xmath12 .",
    "indeed it is shown in @xcite that , with @xmath13 in bridge position , the tunnel  may be made level with its ends at maxima ( or minima ) .",
    "if , when  made level , the ends of the tunnel are at the same maximum , then the tunnel is unknotted and we can appeal to theorem [ theorem : matsuda ] to complete the argument .",
    "if instead the tunnel  has its ends at different maxima then the small perturbation that makes @xmath19 generic will leave it in bridge position , with  monotonic and above the dividing sphere .",
    "consider now how level spheres would intersect a meridian disk @xmath57 of @xmath36 as they sweep across @xmath9 .",
    "we saw that as they sweep across @xmath16 there is at least one level at which the intersection with @xmath16 is an essential collection of curves in @xmath16 .",
    "something must go wrong with this argument when we replace @xmath16 with @xmath57 , for it is impossible to have essential arcs in a disk like @xmath57 .",
    "it s easy to see what can go wrong : it may be that there is a level sphere @xmath86 that simultaneously cuts off both lower and upper disks from @xmath57 , but these disks are incident to @xmath20 in such a complicated way that they ca nt be used to make @xmath9 thinner .",
    "such a complicated arc can only arise when some component of @xmath110 is itself complicated , eg the @xmath18-punctured sphere component @xmath111 of @xmath110 that appears when @xmath86 is a dividing sphere .",
    "( see figure [ fig : sigma ] . ) in particular , we founder when two conditions occur : some subarc @xmath73 of @xmath112 is relatively simple in @xmath111 ( so that @xmath81 ) , while another subarc ( namely the arc on which an upper disk is incident to @xmath111 ) is relatively complex .",
    "since these subarcs are disjoint ( for @xmath112 is embedded ) the possibilities are few .",
    "in fact , and this is not obvious , the most difficult case to handle is one in which the upper disk is so positioned that it defines a way in which @xmath9 can only be made thinner by a whitney move on the edge @xmath12 .",
    "this whitney move has the effect of placing @xmath13 on @xmath23 as a @xmath113-quasi - cable ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 5.5 ) and figure [ fig : oneone ] .",
    "so we naturally move to thinking about @xmath13 as a quasi - cable on some different spine of @xmath20 .",
    "this whitney move begins a kind of inductive process .",
    "we try to repeat the argument in the more general setting in which @xmath105 is presented as a quasi - cable on the neighborhood @xmath20 of a theta - curve heegaard spine .",
    "the knot @xmath13 is kept thinly presented thorughout the process and the strategy is to choose the thinnest possible theta - curve for such a presentation .",
    "if such a thinnest theta - curve @xmath9 contains an unknotted cycle , then ( essentially ) corollary [ cor : matsuda ] can be applied to finish the proof .",
    "if it does nt , then we try to use a meridian @xmath57 of @xmath36 to thin @xmath9 further and observe that it will do so unless , as previously , @xmath9 is in bridge position , some edge of @xmath9 is disjoint from a dividing sphere , and some such dividing sphere @xmath86 cuts off both an upper disk @xmath114 and a lower disk @xmath115 from @xmath57 .",
    "we then consider again how @xmath112 intersects the @xmath18-punctured sphere component @xmath116 of @xmath110 .",
    "if a @xmath39-compressing disk @xmath68 for @xmath16 in @xmath36 cut off from @xmath57 by @xmath16 is incident to @xmath23 in an arc @xmath72 so short that @xmath72 lies entirely in @xmath111 , then the annulus @xmath56 resulting from the @xmath39-compression naturally satisfies the hypothesis of proposition [ prop : uchida ] , so we would be done .",
    "the remaining possibility is that the arc @xmath117 to which @xmath16 @xmath39-compresses is long .",
    "that is , the subarc @xmath72 of @xmath112 is disjoint from @xmath13 , has both its ends on the same side of @xmath13 but passes through @xmath111 perhaps many times .",
    "( we can assume that the ends of @xmath72 both lie in @xmath111 . )",
    "the hope would be that this relatively clear picture of @xmath72 would be enough to show that the upper and lower disks @xmath114 and @xmath115 could either be used to thin @xmath9 further ( a contradiction ) or at least would describe how to perform a whitney move that would thinly present @xmath13 as a ( possibly more complicated ) quasi - cable on an even thinner theta - graph . if this last step works ( as it did in the simple case @xmath118 then when we reach the thinnest possible theta - graph that presents @xmath105 as a quasi - cable we will be done .",
    "either a cycle in the theta - graph is unknotted and we are done by a version of corollary [ cor : matsuda ] or the arc @xmath72 lies entirely in @xmath111 and we are done by proposition [ prop : uchida ] .",
    "the last step in the program outlined in section [ section : psych ] is to exploit upper and lower disks @xmath114 and @xmath115 cut off from a meridian disk @xmath57 of @xmath36 by a level sphere @xmath86 .",
    "the hope is that @xmath114 and @xmath115 can be used either to thin @xmath9 , or at least to perform a useful whitney move on @xmath9 .",
    "just about all we know about the disks @xmath114 and @xmath115 is that they are disjoint from a long arc we ve called @xmath72 that is itself disjoint from @xmath13 and has ends incident to @xmath13 from the same side .",
    "we can also assume ( from thin position ) that @xmath86 lies below an entire edge of @xmath9 , so the corresponding component @xmath111 of @xmath110 is a @xmath18-punctured sphere .",
    "things seems rather hopeless , especially if the edge that is disjoint from @xmath86 is @xmath119 : the definition of quasi - cable means that no subarc of @xmath13 goes directly from @xmath120 to @xmath121 . in particular , an arc in @xmath23 can `` backtrack '' at an end of @xmath119 without necessarily intersecting @xmath13 .",
    "that is , there is an essential arc in @xmath122 with both ends on @xmath123 and with interior disjoint from both of the other meridians @xmath124 .",
    "see figure [ fig : backtrack ] .",
    "this means that , for all we know , the long arc @xmath72 could traverse @xmath111 in a complicated way , passing many times across the meridian @xmath123 and still @xmath72 could be disjoint from @xmath13 . if @xmath72 can be this complicated , there is nothing to prevent @xmath125 from traversing @xmath111 in an equally complicated way and so it would be useless either for thinning or for describing a simple whitney move .        here s an approach to fixing this problem , at least : to ensure that no arc of @xmath112 backtracks at an end of @xmath119 , somehow guarantee that @xmath112 _ does _ backtrack at both ends of another edge , one of @xmath126 , for then no backtracking arc at an end of @xmath119 could be disjoint from @xmath112 .",
    "requiring that @xmath112 backtracks on one of the other edges @xmath126 is more reasonable than it might appear : recall that @xmath57 could have been chosen so that its boundary also bounds a disk @xmath127 .",
    "if we consider how @xmath128 intersects the meridians @xmath129 of @xmath20 , an outermost arc of intersection on @xmath128 will precisely cut off a backtracking arc from @xmath130 .",
    "so we know that there is a back - tracking arc ( called a _ wave _ ) on exactly one edge .",
    "so the refinement needed to avoid backtracking at an end of @xmath119 is to insist that we will only consider theta - graphs which present @xmath105 as a quasi - cable and which also satisfies the _ wave condition _ ; that is , we require that there is a wave of @xmath112 based at one of the meridians @xmath126 .",
    "of course , this restriction means that the inductive step ( i. e. the whitney move ) must be shown to preserve the wave condition at the next stage , including the first stage in which @xmath19 becomes a theta graph presenting @xmath105 as a @xmath113 cable .",
    "checking this is a bit technical and we only note here that it is shown in @xcite that it can be done .    introducing the wave condition gives unexpectedly useful information about the long arc @xmath72 .",
    "if , for example , a wave is based at the meridian @xmath131 of @xmath120 then @xmath72 ca nt pass directly from an end of @xmath121 to an end of @xmath119 since a wave is in the way , nor can it backtrack on any edge , for even in backtracking at an end of @xmath120 it would cross @xmath13 .",
    "it follows , for example , that @xmath72 always crosses each meridian @xmath129 in the same direction .",
    "even more ( somewhat technical ) information is available about @xmath72 and hence about the boundary of the annulus @xmath56 that is obtained from @xmath16 by @xmath39-compressing to @xmath72 , but what we ve described is enough to give an outline of the rest of the argument .",
    "the first observation is that , if @xmath132 were actually parallel to a segment of @xmath133 we would be nearly finished : since @xmath72 does nt backtrack along any edge , there are only a few paths it can take through @xmath111 ; if @xmath134 also took one of these paths , then it s relatively easy to show that @xmath114 and @xmath115 describe a way either to thin @xmath9 or to perform an appropriate whitney move ( depending on the path ) .",
    "it turns out that , when the edge of @xmath9 that is disjoint from @xmath86 is the edge that contains the wave , just knowing that the wave is disjoint from @xmath72 suffices to show there is an appropriate whitney move .",
    "so , for a good representative of the hard cases that remain , we assume that it is the edge @xmath119 that is disjoint from the dividing sphere @xmath86 .",
    "now a brief digression .",
    "we ve noted above that if @xmath134 were parallel to a segment of @xmath133 we would be finished .",
    "this suggests ( and one can prove ) that there is a dividing sphere @xmath86 that intersects the annulus @xmath56 only in essential spanning arcs .",
    "roughly , the argument is the standard thin position argument : if , as @xmath91 sweeps across @xmath9 , there were always some inessential arc of intersection then at some level there would be a dividing sphere that cut off both an upper and a lower disk from @xmath56 .",
    "but @xmath42 does follow ( roughly ) @xmath72 , since @xmath42 is obtained by banding @xmath13 to itself along @xmath72 .",
    "now these two disks could be used , either to thin @xmath9 or to perform an appropriate whitney move , changing @xmath9 to a thinner graph which still presents @xmath105 as a quasi - cable .    in this last hard case",
    "it appears to be difficult to complete the argument as planned , using @xmath114 and @xmath115 , simply because the information that we have ( i. e. that @xmath134 is disjoint from @xmath72 ) does nt seem quite enough to describe a good whitney move .",
    "indeed , this information is nt even enough to show that @xmath114 is disjoint from @xmath13 so it could hardly be used to describe a whitney move on @xmath9 that would nt disrupt the presentation of @xmath13 .",
    "but in the digression and earlier we have seen that in this hard case the annulus @xmath56 to which @xmath16 @xmath39-compresses has some nice properties : its boundary is `` regular '' ( i. e. there is no back - tracking ) and it s relatively easy to describe the type of path its boundary follows , since each boundary component of @xmath56 consists of a copy of @xmath72 and part of @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , @xmath135 consists exclusively of parallel spanning arcs in @xmath56 .",
    "this suggests that a combinatorial approach might be useful , as at the beginning when we used a description of the essential collection of curves @xmath136 to establish that @xmath108 .",
    "in fact the same sort of combinatorial argument does allow us to simplify even further the possible paths that @xmath42 can follow in @xmath23 , but again the argument seems to stop just short of completing the proof .",
    "the exceptional case is quite specific .",
    "each component of @xmath42 can be described as a path in @xmath23 simply by writing down a word in letters @xmath137 that describe the order in which the curve intersects @xmath131 and @xmath138 .",
    "if it intersects @xmath138 with the same orientation that @xmath13 does , write down @xmath139 ; it if intersects @xmath131 with the opposite orientation that @xmath13 does , write down @xmath140",
    ". then it turns out that a combinatorial argument , using the parallel arcs of intersection of @xmath135 in @xmath56 , eliminates all possibilities for @xmath72 except a word @xmath141 that is positive in the letters @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "it also eliminates all possibilities for @xmath42 except the words    * @xmath142 * @xmath143 .",
    "the remarkable regularity of this structure opens another possible way of eliminating this last remaining possibility : use a combinatorial argument in the graph formed in @xmath86 by the arcs @xmath135 .",
    "that is , consider the graph @xmath144 formed in @xmath86 by letting intersection points of @xmath126 with @xmath86 be the vertices and the arc components @xmath145 be the edges .",
    "( the idea of using such graphs seems to go back at least to @xcite . )",
    "remarkable order can be discerned .",
    "there are no inessential loops .",
    "if we orient the edges in @xmath86 so that the corresponding orientation in @xmath56 is from @xmath146 to @xmath44 , there can not be two faces of @xmath147 ( from the same component of @xmath144 ) that have their boundaries consistently oriented in opposite directions , one clockwise and the other counterclockwise . in any case ( suppressing technicalities ) the argument now proceeds by showing that such opposite pairs of faces must always arise , first by showing that they arise when @xmath141 is long , then by successively eliminating all shorter possibilities for @xmath141 .",
    "the argument above is only a sketch , but a particularly important possibility has been glossed over to smooth the flow of the argument .",
    "this final section gives a brief description of how the case arises and how it is handled .",
    "as the argument has been described , thin position puts @xmath9 in bridge position with an edge disjoint from a dividing sphere .",
    "then a surface in @xmath36 ( e. g. the annulus @xmath56 ) is used to find disjoint upper and lower disks .",
    "these disks are used to describe a whitney move on @xmath9 , changing it to an even thinner theta - graph which still thinly presents @xmath105 as a quasi - cable .",
    "what we have suppressed is the possibility that the whitney move described by the disks changes @xmath9 not to another theta - graph but instead to an `` eyeglass '' graph  that is , the graph formed by connecting two loops on different vertices with an edge , called the bridge edge .",
    "see figure [ fig : thetaeye ] . in this epilogue",
    "we briefly describe what to do in this case .",
    "the first important point is that there is a good theory of thin eyeglass heegaard spines in @xmath6 , as there is for theta - graphs , cf @xcite . in particular , when an eyeglass heegaard spine @xmath148 is put in thin position , either it s in bridge position with the bridge edge disjoint from a dividing sphere , or at least one of the two loops in @xmath148 is unknotted . for our purposes ,",
    "some further argument is needed to show that the moves used to thin @xmath148 would not destroy the thinness of a knot @xmath13 sitting appropriately on the boundary of its regular neighborhood @xmath20 .",
    "the way in which @xmath13 sits on @xmath149 is easy to describe ( it s called a _ @xmath150-eyeglass presentation _ in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 4.1 ) ) and so it is straightforward to verify that the thinning moves on @xmath148 do not disrupt the thinness of @xmath13 . if , once @xmath148 is thin , one of the loops is the unknot , the argument concludes essentially via theorem [ theorem : matsuda ] . if instead all that we know is that the bridge edge is disjoint from a dividing sphere , it s still easy to verify also that there is an associated embedding of @xmath9 that is no thicker than @xmath148 .",
    "the upshot is this : if a @xmath150-eyeglass presentation is needed because the wrong sort of whitney move is given by the upper and lower disks , then thin position can be applied to the eyeglass curve @xmath148 as well , in a way that leads to a contradiction .",
    "that is , if a whitney move converts a theta - graph @xmath9 into a @xmath150-eyeglass presentation on @xmath148 , then @xmath148 , as imbedded , is thinner than @xmath9 was .",
    "now isotope @xmath148",
    "so it is in thin position .",
    "this can be done without affecting the fact that @xmath13 is in thin position and , afterwards , @xmath9 itself could be recovered from @xmath148 in a way that maintains the same width as @xmath148 , and so actually leaves @xmath9 thinner than when it begain .",
    "this is a contradiction , since @xmath9 was originally supposed to be in thin position .",
    "so the role of the @xmath150-eyeglass is merely `` catalytic '' in the sense that the eyeglass curve @xmath148 appears briefly , and only so that thin position applied to @xmath148 carries the original imbedding of @xmath9 to an even thinner imbedding of @xmath9 .",
    "but it s appearance is consistent with and indeed reinforces the central theme of the argument : thin position for heegaard spines is a useful tool to understand the geometry and topology of knots that lie on their corresponding heegaard surfaces ."
