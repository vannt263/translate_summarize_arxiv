    "continuously - driven kerr microresonators have recently emerged as an attractive platform for the generation of optical frequency combs and corresponding high repetition rate pulse trains  @xcite . in these devices ,",
    "comb formation proceeds via the third - order optical `` kerr '' nonlinearity  @xcite .",
    "modulation instability ( mi ) driven by parametric four - wave mixing leads to the generation of signal and idler sidebands that subsequently interact so as to form an array of equidistant spectral components  @xcite . for suitable parameters , the phases of the comb lines can lock  @xcite , thus leading to the formation of stable pulse sequences that may correspond to periodic mi patterns  @xcite or localized temporal cavity solitons  @xcite . before their observation in microresonators , similar dynamics and temporal structures were discovered and investigated in macroscopic optical fibre cavities  @xcite ; analogous phenomena in spatial nonlinear optics are rooted into an even longer history  @xcite .",
    "whilst kerr nonlinearity underpins the dynamics observed in all _ microresonator _ comb studies reported to date , recent experiments in _ bulk free - space _ cavities have remarkably demonstrated that frequency combs can also arise purely through second - order @xmath0 nonlinear effects  @xcite .",
    "motivated by these experimental findings , we recently introduced a general theoretical framework that allows for the temporal and spectral dynamics of light in such quadratically nonlinear resonators to be described , both analytically and numerically  @xcite . to facilitate comparison with experiments , in  @xcite we focussed on singly resonant , phase - matched cavity - enhanced second - harmonic generation ( shg ) , obtaining good agreement with the corresponding measurements",
    "our theoretical analysis showed that the temporal walk - off between the fields at the fundamental and second - harmonic frequencies plays a key role in the frequency comb formation dynamics , underpinning the mi process and the subsequent formation of drifting pulse trains .",
    "although purely quadratic frequency combs have so far only been observed in bulk free - space cavities  @xcite , several platforms have recently emerged that may allow for similar sources to be implemented with integrated microresonators  @xcite . in such devices , all interacting fields are likely to simultaneously resonate and exhibit low - losses , in stark contrast with the singly resonant system studied in  @xcite , where the second - harmonic field was fully extracted from the cavity after each round trip .",
    "previous studies in _ spatially diffractive _",
    "@xmath0 resonators have established that the build - up and evolution of the cavity fields may differ considerably depending on the number of resonating fields  @xcite , prompting one to anticipate that the particular _ singly resonant _ mean - field equation derived in  @xcite will not be directly suitable for the modelling of _ doubly resonant _ microresonator shg systems . although the dynamics of doubly resonant cavity shg has been extensively investigated in the past  @xcite , the vast majority of studies have only considered a very limited number of spectral components ( up to 4 ) . such an approach is unsuitable for the modelling of frequency combs with hundreds or even thousands of spectral components . in 1996 ,",
    "trillo and haelterman introduced a full time - domain model of cavity shg  @xcite , predicting the formation of pulse trains via mi .",
    "their approach does not suffer from limitations on the number of frequency components ; however , the analysis presented in  @xcite was restricted to negligible temporal walk - off , which is not a suitable condition for realistic quadratic materials  @xcite .",
    "doubly resonant cavity - enhanced shg has also been studied in the context of spatial pattern formation  @xcite , but those studies also offer limited insights into dispersive resonators because spatial systems do not have a counterpart for _ strong _ temporal walk - off . given the growing interest in dispersive @xmath0 microresonators  @xcite , there is clearly a need for realistic models capable of predicting the associated nonlinear optical phenomena .    in this article",
    ", we theoretically examine the full temporal and spectral dynamics of intracavity shg when the fundamental and the second harmonic fields are both resonant , focussing in particular our attention on the previously unexplored role of temporal walk - off .",
    "our main intent is to present model equations that allow for the simulation and analysis of such cavity systems , as well as to describe some general features and illustrative predictions derived from that model ; a full analysis of the bifurcations and associated temporal dynamics is nevertheless left for future work .",
    "our study shows that , even for a large temporal walk - off , doubly resonant cavity shg can be efficiently and accurately modelled by using two coupled mean - field equations .",
    "although the system s general nonlinear behaviour differs considerably from the singly resonant configuration studied in  @xcite , we find that , similarly to that configuration , the temporal walk - off between the fundamental and the second - harmonic fields plays a very significant role . indeed , we find that the large walk - off values of realistic quadratic cavities can give rise to new mi bands that display completely different features with respect to those identified previously  @xcite for negligible walk - off .",
    "numerical simulations performed in this regime reveal very rich dynamical behaviours , including the formation of stable temporal patterns corresponding to coherent optical frequency combs .",
    "we also show that the two coupled equations that govern the dynamics of the doubly resonant system can be reduced , under realistic approximations , to a single mean - field equation that displays formal similarities with the corresponding equation that governs singly resonant cavity shg .",
    "the significantly different dynamics that manifest themselves in the two types of cavities are simply captured by different nonlinear response functions .",
    "analysis of the single reduced mean - field equation allows us to derive a simple expression for the system s mi gain spectrum , thus enabling us to obtain considerable physical insights into the underlying mechanisms .",
    "we expect that our theoretical framework and results will be highly relevant in the study of frequency comb generation in emerging quadratically nonlinear cavities .",

    "at this point we emphasise that , although eqs .   and   account for the dominant physical processes at play in dispersive , doubly resonant cavity shg , additional perturbative terms may be necessary to ensure the model s validity under specific conditions",
    ". rigorous analysis of spectrally broadband signals can , for example , require the inclusion of higher - order dispersion terms ( @xmath43 ) .",

    "analogous results ( using formally similar equations with @xmath45 ) were later reported in the context of spatially diffractive cavities  @xcite .",

    "exhibits complex dependence on the cavity detuning parameters @xmath69 as well as on the phase - mismatch parameter @xmath70 .",
    "because we are first and foremost interested in the role of walk - off , we assume a resonator that is made entirely out of the nonlinear material ( such as a monolithic microresonator ) , and assume the shg to be naturally phase - matched .",
    "in such a configuration , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 ( see appendix  [ apx2 ] ) .",
    "a typical example of the predicted gain as a function of frequency @xmath53 and walk - off @xmath18 is shown in fig .",
    "[ figmi](a ) . to facilitate comparison with earlier studies of spatial cavities where walk - off was not considered  @xcite ,",
    "we have adopted a similar set of parameters ( listed in the caption ; note that with these parameters the cw response is monostable ) . in agreement with those studies ( but in contrast to the case of singly resonant shg  @xcite ) , we see that mi can arise even when @xmath44 .",
    "as the walk - off @xmath18 increases , however , the gain quickly reduces and eventually disappears altogether : the cw mode becomes modulationally stable .",
    "surprisingly , for sufficiently large walk - off values ( @xmath73 ) mi re - emerges , but at a very different spectral position [ see also fig .",
    "[ figmi](c ) ] .",
    "it thus appears that , in addition to mi identified previously with @xmath44  @xcite , the cavity also supports another mi regime that manifests itself for @xmath46 . at this point",
    ", we emphasize that we have confirmed our mean - field - based mi analysis by comparing the results against those obtained from the full infinite - dimensional cavity map .",
    "specifically , we derived the mi gain spectrum from the full cavity map by using an approach similar to that previously employed for kerr resonators  @xcite , and we found the results to be in almost exact agreement with those shown in fig .",
    "[ figmi ] .",
    "an example of the agreement is explicitly shown in fig .",
    "[ figmi](c ) , where we compare the mi gain spectra obtained from eq .",
    "( solid and dashed curves ) and from the full cavity map ( circles and diamonds ) for two different walk - off values ( @xmath44 and @xmath74 ) .",
    "( for full details on the stability analysis of the full map , see appendix  [ apx3 ] . )",
    "the excellent agreement clearly validates the use of a mean - field model , even when @xmath46 .",
    "mi leads to the amplification of spectral sidebands around @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which in the time domain manifests itself as the growth of periodic modulations on top of the cw fields .",
    "similarly to the singly resonant case  @xcite , the generated patterns are found to exhibit a temporal drift whose magnitude is much smaller than the walk - off @xmath18 . as a matter of fact",
    ", the drift rate @xmath75 , where @xmath76 represents the fast time coordinate of a particular point along the sinusoidal perturbation emerging from mi , can be obtained from the imaginary part of the corresponding eigenvalue as @xmath77/\\omega$ ] , with @xmath53 being the frequency of the pattern  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ figmi](b ) we show the drift rate @xmath78 predicted at frequencies experiencing the maximum mi gain as a function of walk - off . for small @xmath18 , the drift rate increases monotonously as @xmath79 ( see inset ) up until the point where mi disappears ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "but interestingly , for walk - off values associated with the re - emergence of mi ( @xmath81 ) , the sign of the drift changes and its magnitude remains almost constant , with @xmath82 .",
    "this means that the nonlinearity compensates for the linear spectral phase induced by the walk - off , which is likely to explain why we systematically find that , even for very large @xmath83 , the mean - field approach yields results that are in almost identical agreement with those obtained from the full map ( see appendix  [ apx1 ] for the full map equations ) .",
    "indeed , the nonlinear cancellation of the linear walk - off ensures that the key condition behind the mean - field approximation is satisfied : the fields only evolve slowly , with no significant changes over a single round trip .",
    "after the initial stage of exponential sideband amplification , the modulation triggered by mi may reshape into complex temporal patterns and corresponding frequency combs .",
    "in fact , extensive simulations of the mean - field eqs .   and   reveal several distinct dynamical regimes with a rich nonlinear behaviour . to give an example of the diversity",
    ", we carried out a single long simulation that mimics the experimental procedure of sweeping the driving laser across a cavity resonance  @xcite .",
    "specifically , we use an initial condition consisting of white noise ( amplitude @xmath84 ) , start the simulation far from resonance with @xmath85 ( natural phase - matching is assumed throughout , so that @xmath86 and @xmath72 ) , and we then slowly increase the detuning up to @xmath87 over a ( normalised ) slow time scale of @xmath88 ( the precise dynamics may depend on the speed of the detuning ramp ) . in this simulation , we have set @xmath89 and also assumed the group - velocity dispersion at the sh wavelength to be normal , @xmath90 , which is a more realistic situation for temporal cavity dynamics ( recall that the parameters in fig .",
    "[ figmi ] were chosen so as to facilitate comparison with prior studies in spatial cavity systems ) . at this point",
    "we may remark , however , that for @xmath46 we find the group velocity dispersion @xmath91 to have negligible impact .",
    "this can be understood by noting that the dispersion at the second - harmonic reads @xmath92 , with @xmath53 and @xmath91 of the order of unity by normalization .",
    "we first show , in fig .",
    "[ figsweep](a ) , the cw cavity response [ i.e. , @xmath93 given by eq .  ] for the different detunings accessed during the simulation . because @xmath72 , the cw resonance displays a complex double - peaked shape that is symmetric around @xmath94 .",
    "( it is worth noting that for constant @xmath95 , the resonance would exhibit a tilt  @xcite similar to the case of kerr cavities  @xcite . )",
    "the cw modes are stable ( blue solid line ) for large @xmath96 , but also for detunings close to the peak on the positive detuning side .",
    "portions of the resonance with a negative slope are unstable against cw perturbations ( dotted red line ) , whilst the cw modes are modulationally unstable ( dashed red line ) dominantly for detunings in between the two resonance maxima .",
    "figure  [ figsweep](b ) shows the simulated intracavity spectrum around the fundamental frequency as the detuning is slowly increased . for each detuning",
    ", we also highlight the regions that exhibit mi ( areas within the dashed white boxes ) , as well as the critical point where the gain is the largest ( solid white line ) . in agreement with the linear stability analysis ,",
    "the cw solution becomes modulationally unstable around @xmath97 , at which point spectral sidebands grow at the frequency of maximum gain that is separated by multiple fsrs from the pump .",
    "( the normalized round - trip time is @xmath98 , corresponding to an fsr of @xmath99 . ) as @xmath100 increases , the sidebands are seen to experience several abrupt frequency shifts towards the pump , with the sidebands frequency detunings following the maximum mi gain frequency ( solid white line ) . in the time - domain , each abrupt frequency shift manifests itself as a reduction of the repetition rate of the temporal mi pattern .",
    "a detailed investigation is beyond the scope of our work , yet we note that this frequency transition is reminiscent of the so - called eckhaus instability  @xcite . in that process , a periodic pattern whose frequency is far from the critical point goes unstable , which leads to the elimination of that pattern and to the eventual formation of a new pattern closer to the critical point  @xcite .",
    "this is indeed similar to what occurs in the simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ figsweep](b ) .",
    "because the maximum mi gain frequency evolves with @xmath100 , a given sideband will eventually be so detuned from the critical frequency that the corresponding pattern goes unstable , thus resulting in the emergence of another pattern with frequency closer to the maximum mi gain .    around @xmath101 , fig .",
    "[ figsweep](b ) shows that the system transitions to a very different regime , where the spectrum is dominantly composed of spectral lines spaced by a single fsr .",
    "this transition is in fact similar to the one observed in kerr microresonators  @xcite , when the field evolves from stable to chaotic mi patterns  @xcite .",
    "analogously , closer examination of results in fig .",
    "[ figsweep](b ) shows that , for @xmath102 , the intracavity field mostly consists of unstable temporal patterns that exhibit strong fluctuations . yet",
    ", narrow regions of stability can also be identified .",

    "[ figpattern ] we show temporal and spectral characteristics of this regime in more details .",
    "these results were obtained by running another simulation , where the detuning sweep was stopped at @xmath104 .",

    "[ figmi](b ) .",
    "interestingly , around @xmath106 we have also found stable frequency combs whose lines are spaced by a single fsr .",

    "[ simple_mi](b ) from the parametric gain in fig .",
    "[ simple_mi](c ) . ]",
    "several observations can be made .",
    "first , similarly with the singly resonant configuration  @xcite , nonlinear losses are significantly impacted by walk - off [ fig .",
    "[ simple_mi](b ) ] .",
    "but in contrast with that configuration , where the loss profile as a function of frequency was found to follow a simple @xmath132 shape linked to the sfg efficiency , we find that in the doubly resonant scheme it is the condition of resonance around the second harmonic that mostly defines the loss profile .",
    "specifically , a sum - frequency component at @xmath133 is on resonance when @xmath134 , leading to enhanced sfg losses around @xmath135 .",
    "closer inspection of data shown in fig .",
    "[ simple_mi](b ) indeed reveals that ( i ) the loss bands have lorentzian resonance profiles and ( ii ) one of them is always centered at @xmath136 , with the second band at @xmath137 arising due to the coupling between sidebands at @xmath129 [ see @xmath138 terms in eq .  ] . in this context , it is worth pointing out that , because the sfg losses are proportional to @xmath139 = \\mathrm{re}[\\hat{j}(\\omega ) ] + \\mathrm{re}[\\hat{j}(-\\omega)]$ ] , the loss profile is simply governed by the real part of @xmath117 [ defined in eq .  ] . for @xmath73 , that profile assumes a lorentzian shape [ see also fig .",
    "[ responsefig](a ) ] .",
    "in addition to affecting losses , walk - off also has a significant impact on the parametric gain profile [ figure  [ simple_mi](c ) ] , which is in stark contrast with the singly resonant configuration  @xcite .",
    "we suspect this is because , in the doubly resonant scheme , the sfg process imparts a nonlinear phase shift for sidebands around @xmath140 , resulting in the disruption of the usual parametric phase - matching .",
    "this nonlinear phase shift is manifested in the last term inside the square root in eq .  .",
    "in contrast to the nonlinear losses , the square root term describing parametric gain is found to depend both on the real and the imaginary parts of @xmath117 .",
    "we also remark that the profile of the imaginary part of @xmath117 is reminiscent of the real part of a resonant atomic susceptibility , as shown in fig .",
    "[ responsefig](b ) , which is not particularly surprising given the resemblance between @xmath117 and the frequency response of a damped and driven ( with an impulse at @xmath141 ) harmonic oscillator .",
    "the combined effect of the sfg - induced losses and phase shifts is to hinder the oscillation of the parametric sidebands , such that net mi gain only arises at frequencies far away from those associated with resonant sfg .",
    "this notion allows us to better understand the role of walk - off in facilitating mi .",
    "specifically , eq .   shows that the resonance is centred at @xmath142 and has a linewidth of @xmath143 .",
    "it is thus clear that for increasing values of the walk - off parameter @xmath18 , the resonance bands shift closer to the pump and decrease in width , thereby affecting a narrowing sliver of frequencies around @xmath144 .",
    "we illustrate this behaviour in figs .",
    "[ responsefig](a ) and ( b ) , where we respectively show the real and imaginary parts of @xmath117 for two different walk - off parameters [ other parameters as in fig .  [ simple_mi ] ] .",
    "parametric gain capable of driving mi is obtained when the resonance - associated losses and phase shifts no longer affect frequency components that would exhibit gain in its absence [ i.e. , when neglecting the last term inside the square root in eq .  ] . in fig .",
    "[ simple_mi](c ) we indeed see how , for sufficiently large walk - off , gain bands emerge beyond the narrow lorentzian resonance features .",
    "of course , we emphasise that the precise gain features discussed above [ and illustrated in figs .",
    "[ figmi ] and  [ simple_mi ] ] depend on the particular parameters involved .",
    "nevertheless , we have found that our general insights are capable of elucidating the mi characteristics over a wide range of conditions . as a matter of example",
    ", we note that changing the sign of the second - harmonic dispersion term @xmath91 in figs .",
    "[ figmi ] and  [ simple_mi ] leads to the disappearance of the mi bands around @xmath145 .",
    "this can be explained by noting that , when @xmath146\\neq\\mathrm{sgn}[\\delta_2]$ ] , the second - harmonic resonance condition can be fulfilled even for @xmath44 , leading to the disruption of sideband oscillation .",
    "finally , we wish to stress that , although the analyses presented in this section agree very well with results derived from the more general coupled mean - field eqs .   and  , the simplified mean - field eq .   as well as the associated mi gain eq",
    "result from an approximation .",
    "therefore all predictions of eqs .   and   should be corroborated by carefully comparing the pertinent results against those obtained from eqs .   and  , as we have done here .",
    "let us briefly discuss the observability of frequency combs in doubly resonant intracavity shg , considering the system in  @xcite as an illustrative example .",
    "this configuration can be made doubly resonant by replacing all of the cavity mirrors with ones that exhibit high reflectivity both at the fundamental wavelength of 1064  nm as well as at the second - harmonic of 532  nm . moreover ,",
    "independent control of the two detunings can be implemented by managing the intracavity dispersion , e.g. through an adjustable dispersive plate .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the cavity losses at the fundamental and the sh wavelengths are approximately equal , such that @xmath147 .",

    "our calculations predict mi with a frequency shift as high as 1  thz .    in conclusion",
    ", we have theoretically examined the temporal and spectral dynamics of doubly resonant intracavity shg .",
    "we have found that the system can be accurately modelled by using two coupled mean - field equations , provided that the walk - off between the fundamental and the second - harmonic fields is appropriately included in the analysis .",
    "our work indeed shows that , similarly to the case of singly resonant cavity shg  @xcite , the walk - off plays a key role in the dynamics .",
    "for example , in addition to mi identified previously for the case of negligible walk - off , an instability with very different characteristics arises for large walk - off values that are typical of realistic systems .",
    "numerical simulations carried out in this regime predict that cavity mi may lead to the formation of stable ( and unstable ) pulse trains and corresponding optical frequency combs .",
    "these predictions give examples of the rich nonlinear behaviour that can be anticipated , but we emphasize that a considerable body of future work is needed to fully explore the solutions and their bifurcations across different parameter planes .",
    "( for example we have found that the walk - off highly impacts the hopf bifurcation reported in  @xcite . )",
    "we have also derived , for the first time to our knowledge , a single reduced mean - field equation that captures the main dynamics in doubly resonant shg .",
    "this framework has enabled us to obtain a simple expression for the system s mi gain characteristics , allowing for deep insights into the underlying physics .    we expect that our work will have significant predictive impact on the emerging field of frequency comb generation in @xmath0 microresonators , where several fields are likely to resonate simultaneously .",
    "moreover , while we have here restricted our attention to the case of doubly resonant cavity - enhanced shg , the model equations can be straightforwardly adapted to describe a variety of other dispersive , quadratically nonlinear cavity processes .",
    "these include cavities where second- and third - order nonlinearities both contribute to the dynamics  @xcite , sum - frequency generation in resonators  @xcite as well as optical parametric oscillators  @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that quadratically nonlinear resonators have historically attracted significant interest in the field of nonlinear dynamics and pattern formation  @xcite , and we expect that the novel dynamical regimes identified in our work will also stimulate substantial further research in that context .",
