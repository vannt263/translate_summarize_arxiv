    "the burgers equation @xmath21 describes a variety of nonlinear wave phenomena arising in the theory of wave propagation , acoustics , plasma physics and so on ( see , e.g. , whitham 1974 ; gurbatov , malakhov & saichev 1991 ) .",
    "it was originally introduced by jan  m.  burgers ( 1939 ) as a toy model for turbulence . on the one hand",
    ", it shares a number of properties with the navier  stokes equation : the same type of nonlinearity , of invariance groups and of energy - dissipation relation , the existence of a multidimensional version , etc . on the other hand ,",
    "it is known to be integrable ( hopf 1950 ; cole 1951 ) and therefore lacks the property of sensitive dependence on the initial conditions ( chaos ) .",
    "when this was realized , interest in the burgers equation as a toy model for navier  stokes turbulence abated somewhat .",
    "more recently , it became clear that a number of questions connected to the burgers equation are far from trivial .",
    "one class of problems , arising e.g. in surface growth ( barabsi & stanley 1995 ) , leads to a burgers equation with a random driving force ( usually white - noise in time ) added to the right hand side ( kardar , parisi & zhang 1986 ; bouchaud , mzard & parisi 1995 ; cheklov & yakhot 1995 ; polyakov 1995 ; gurarie & migdal 1996 ; e _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) . even in the absence of a driving force ,",
    "the explicit solution provided by the hopf ",
    "cole method leads to non - trivial problems in the limit of vanishing viscosity , when random initial conditions are assumed .",
    "an example , motivated by work on large - scale structures in the universe ( zeldovich 1970 ; gurbatov & saichev 1984 ; gurbatov , saichev & shandarin 1989 ; shandarin & zeldovich 1989 ) , is when the initial velocity field is a brownian ( or fractional brownian ) process in the space variable ( she , aurell & frisch 1992 ; sinai 1992 ; vergassola _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; aurell _ et al .",
    "other examples arise in the sudy of disordered systems ( bouchaud & mzard 1997 ) .",
    "another instance , which is at the core of the present study , is the long - time behavior of freely decaying solutions in the limit of zero viscosity and , in particular the law of decay of the energy . before reviewing this issue",
    "it is useful to put it into a broader perspective , namely the law of decay for three - dimensional navier  stokes turbulence .",
    "krmn & howarth ( 1938 ; see also lin & reid 1963 ) , investigating the decay of high - reynolds number , homogeneous isotropic three - dimensional turbulence , proposed a self - preservation ( self - similarity ) ansatz for the spatial correlation function of the velocity : the correlation function keeps a fixed functional shape ; the integral scale @xmath22 and the root - mean - square velocity @xmath23 have a long - time power - law behavior ; there are two exponents which can be related by the condition that the energy dissipation per unit mass should be proportional to @xmath24 . but _ an additional relation _ is needed to actually determine the exponents .",
    "kolmogorov ( 1941 ) realized this and proposed using the so - called `` loitsyansky ( 1939 ) invariant '' as the additional relation and , thereby , derived a law of energy decay @xmath25 .",
    "proudman & reid ( 1954 ) and batchelor & proudman ( 1956 ) showed that the integral considered by loitsyansky is actually not invariant . under the assumption that the energy spectrum @xmath26 at small wavenumbers @xmath1 , the loitsyansky integral is , within a numerical factor , just the coefficient of @xmath27 .",
    "for isotropic turbulence , the contribution of the nonlinear term to the time derivative of the energy spectrum , which is called the transfer function , should be proportional to @xmath27 at small @xmath1 , thereby preventing the constancy of the loitsyansky integral .",
    "however , if initially @xmath28 with a `` spectral exponent '' @xmath29 , then the coefficient of @xmath4 will be invariant .",
    "this is called here the principle of `` permanence of large eddies '' ( ple ) .",
    "kolmogorov s argument is easily adapted to that case and gives then @xmath30 ( see , e.g. , frisch 1995 , section  7.7 ) .",
    "almost exactly the same arguments may be applied to the one - dimensional burgers turbulence . in one dimension",
    "the transfer function should be proportional to @xmath5 at small @xmath1 ( see section  [ s : pheno ] ) .",
    "hence , if the initial energy spectrum @xmath31 with @xmath32 , kolmogorov s argument predicts again @xmath30 .",
    "we shall see that this is correct only when @xmath33 .    for navier",
    " stokes turbulence , a rigorous derivation of the law of energy decay seems ruled out at present .",
    "the situation is of course more favorable for burgers - type turbulence and it will be our main goal in this paper to critically examine the issues of self - similarity and energy decay at long times . in this paper we shall exclusively consider the behavior of the solutions in the limit of vanishing viscosity for gaussian initial data .",
    "for the effect of a finite ( small ) viscosity and/or non - gaussian initial data ( e.g. , piecewise constant or shot noise velocities ) , the reader is referred to recent papers by funaki , surgailis & woyczynski ( 1995 ) , surgailis ( 1996 , 1997 ) and hu & woyczynski ( 1996 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ s : formulation ] , we formulate our problem and list some elementary results about the burgers equation to be used in what follows .",
    "section  [ s : pheno ] is devoted to phenomenological derivations of the main results about the decay of random solutions to the burgers equation , the nature of which depends crucially on the spectral exponent @xmath2 .",
    "the most delicate results , obtained when @xmath14 , are rederived by systematic methods in sections  [ s : homogeneous ] and  [ s : correlations ] . in section  [ s : previouswork ] we discuss previous work on this issue . in section  [ s : homogeneous ] we derive the law of decay of energy as the leading term in a systematic expansion .",
    "our basic tool is the cumulant expansion ( balian & schaeffer , 1989 ) of the probability of finding regions in space without particles . in section  [ s : correlations ] we calculate the spatial correlation function , and prove the permanence of large eddies . in section  [",
    "s : intermediate ] we summarize our main findings and derive consequences , such as the absence of globally self - similar decay for the energy spectrum when @xmath3",
    ". section  [ s : numerics ] presents high - resolution numerical experiments which confirm such findings .",
    "section  [ s : conclusion ] presents concluding remarks .",
    "the appendix contains a rederivation of the balian ",
    "schaeffer formula in a form appropriate for our problem .",
    "we shall be concerned with the initial - value problem for the unforced burgers equation in one dimension : @xmath34 use will also be made of the conservation form of the burgers equation : @xmath35 and of the formulation in terms of the ( velocity ) potential : @xmath36 where @xmath37 as is well - known , the solution to the burgers equation with positive viscosity @xmath38 , has an explicit integral representation obtained by hopf ( 1950 ) and cole ( 1951 ) .",
    "we are mainly interested here in the solutions in the limit of vanishing viscosity .",
    "use of laplace s method then leads to the following `` maximum representation '' for the potential ( hopf 1950 ) in the limit of vanishing viscosity ( henceforth always understood ) : @xmath39 , \\label{phifunction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the initial potential .",
    "expansion of the square shows that ( [ max ] ) is basically a legendre transformation . from ( [ vpsi ] ) and ( [ max ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the coordinate at which @xmath43 achieves its ( global ) maximum for given @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "it is easily checked that @xmath46 is the lagrangian coordinate from which emanates the fluid particle which will be at @xmath44 at time @xmath45 ( see , e.g. , gurbatov _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 ) .    in what follows",
    "we shall work with homogeneous random velocity fields .",
    "we list the main definitions .",
    "the correlation function is @xmath47 where the angular brackets denote ensemble averages .",
    "its fourier transform , the energy spectrum is @xmath48 the initial values of the correlation function and of the energy spectrum are denoted @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the ( mean ) energy is @xmath51 the initial energy is denoted @xmath52    we now introduce the basic assumptions of this paper .",
    "the initial velocity field is homogeneous and gaussian with an energy spectrum of the form @xmath53 where @xmath2 is the spectral exponent .",
    "the even and non - negative function @xmath54 is assumed to satisfy @xmath55 .",
    "it is smooth and decreases faster than any inverse power of @xmath1 at infinity ( this implies , of course , that the initial velocity correlation function is very smooth ) .",
    "@xmath54 can be characterized by a wavenumber @xmath56 around which lies most of the initial energy and which is , in order of magnitude , the inverse of the initial integral scale @xmath57 .",
    "the usual definition of the integral scale , which involves the integral of the correlation function , is not appropriate since this integral vanishes for any @xmath58 .",
    "instead , we use @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the variance of the initial potential @xmath61 this definition of @xmath57 will be convenient in deriving various long - time laws in sections  [ s : homogeneous ] and [ s : correlations ] .",
    "as we shall see , the value of the spectral exponent @xmath2 determines the universality class of the decaying solution at long times . in order for the velocity to be homogeneous",
    "its variance must be finite ; hence , we must have @xmath62 .",
    "when @xmath63 the velocity has infinite variance and only increments are homogeneous ; the velocity itself behaves , at large distances , as a brownian or fractional brownian motion process , a case considered by she _",
    "( 1992 ) , sinai ( 1992 ) , vergassola _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) , which is not within the scope of the present paper . when @xmath9 the velocity is homogeneous whereas the potential behaves , at large distances , as a brownian or fractional brownian motion process .",
    "this case has already been investigated by burgers ( 1974 ) , by she _",
    "( 1992 ) and by avellaneda & e ( 1995 ) and will be considered here only briefly .",
    "we shall concentrate on the case @xmath14 , when both the velocity and the potential are homogeneous .",
    "we observe that the smoothness of the energy spectrum at the origin depends on the spectral exponent @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath2 is an even integer , our assumption implies that the initial correlation function @xmath64 , being the @xmath2th derivative of a smooth function of @xmath44 decreasing rapidly at infinity , also has these properties .",
    "when @xmath2 is odd or non - integer the spectrum is not smooth .",
    "it follows that the correlation function decreases as a power law ( pitman 1968 ; bleistein & handelsman 1975 ) , _ viz _ is used for the leading - order term in asymptotic expansions , @xmath65 is used to relate two quantities which may differ by an order unity dimensionless constant and @xmath66 when the quantities are just proportional .",
    "] @xmath67 where @xmath68    next , we observe that , when @xmath14 , the initial potential @xmath69 is a homogeneous random function while , for @xmath70 , it only has homogeneous increments . in the former case ,",
    "the potential has a translation - invariant correlation function , denoted by @xmath71 , the fourier transform of which is @xmath72 . in the latter case ,",
    "it is simpler to characterize the initial potential by its structure function @xmath73 which is still translation - invariant and exists as long as @xmath62 .",
    "it is related to the energy spectrum by @xmath74 when @xmath14 the structure function goes to a finite limit at large separations while , when @xmath70 , it grows without bound : @xmath75    an important consequence of ( [ bep ] ) , ( [ vpsi ] ) and ( [ defet ] ) , valid whenever the velocity is homogeneous , irrespective of the potential being or not being homogeneous , is @xmath76 it relates the energy to the time - derivative of the mean potential , which does not dependent on the position @xmath44 .",
    "we now recall some results about the burgers equations which are relatively standard and will be used in what follows .",
    "when @xmath77 , the correlation invariant @xmath78 is time independent .",
    "indeed , using the conservation form of the burgers equation ( [ bec ] ) , it is checked that the time derivative of the integral in ( [ correlator ] ) , limited from @xmath79 to @xmath80 is expressed in terms of correlations between quantities evaluated at points a distance @xmath81 apart .",
    "such correlations vanish as @xmath82 because , with our assumptions , the initial conditions have decreasing correlations at large separation and this property will be preserved . should not exceed a value @xmath83",
    ". it should be possible to prove this rigorously for the kind of initial conditions assumed here . ]",
    "note that @xmath84 is just the value of the energy spectrum at @xmath85 .",
    "a straightforward consequence of the burgers equation with a homogeneous velocity field is @xmath86 which relates the correlation function @xmath87 and the third order structure function @xmath88 ^ 3\\rangle$ ] .",
    "this equation is the analogue of the krmn  howarth equation for navier  stokes turbulence .",
    "just as the latter implies kolmogorov s four - fifths law ( see , e.g. , frisch 1995 ) , eq .",
    "( [ karmanhowarth ] ) implies a `` twelve law '' : in the limit of vanishing viscosity and at scales much smaller than the integral scale , we have @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the mean energy dissipation .",
    "eq .  ( [ karmanhowarth ] ) or ( [ law12 ] ) , in the limit of zero viscosity , puts a strong constraint on self - similar decaying solutions both for navier  stokes and burgers turbulence . by self - similar decaying solutions",
    ", we understand the following : when the velocity @xmath91 and the space coordinate @xmath44 are rescaled by suitable time - dependent scaling factors @xmath23 and @xmath22 , the ( single - time ) statistical properties of the solution become independent of the time .",
    "this definition implies in particular the following scalings for the correlation function and the third - order structure function of the velocity : @xmath92 with dimensionless time - independent functions @xmath93 and @xmath94 . substituting ( [ bsim])-([ssim ] ) into ( [ karmanhowarth ] ) for @xmath95 and demanding that @xmath93 and @xmath96 be time independent , we obtain two first - order differential equations relating @xmath23 and @xmath22 , namely , @xmath97 where the dot denotes time differentiation and @xmath98 and @xmath99 are two dimensionless undetermined constants .",
    "note that exactly the same equations are obtained with a self - similarity ansatz for navier  stokes turbulence .",
    "( [ utltodes ] ) has power - law solutions)-([ssim ] ) and ( [ utltodes ] ) only in an _ asymptotic _ sense , for long times and to leading order .",
    "we shall then see that @xmath23 and @xmath22 may take the form of power laws with logarithmic corrections . ]",
    "but , as already pointed out by kolmogorov ( 1941 ) , the exponents in the power laws can not be determined solely from the self - similarity ansatz .",
    "additional ingredients are needed .",
    "for what follows it will be convenient to give a precise definition of the scaling factors .",
    "we choose @xmath23 to be the r.m.s .",
    "velocity @xmath100 and we define the `` integral scale '' @xmath22 by taking @xmath101 in ( [ utltodes ] ) , that is @xmath102    let us finally note that in fourier space the self - similarity ansatz ( [ bsim ] ) , together with ( [ ult ] ) , translates into @xmath103 @xmath104 where our choice of normalization of the energy as @xmath105 imposes that @xmath106 .",
    "an important role in the decay at long times is played by the principle of _ permanence of large eddies _ ( ple ) .",
    "we shall give two formulations almost  but not quite  equivalent , one in physical space and the other one in fourier space .",
    "* ple : physical space formulation .",
    "* we assume that the gaussian initial velocity has a correlation function with a power - law behavior at large distances : @xmath107 with an exponent @xmath62 .",
    "then , ( [ largexinit ] ) remains true at any later time , with the same exponent @xmath2 and the same constant @xmath108 .",
    "* ple : fourier space formulation .",
    "* we assume that the gaussian initial velocity has a spectrum with a power - law behavior at small wavenumbers : @xmath109 with an exponent @xmath110 .",
    "then , ( [ initspecpowerlaw ] ) remains true at any later time , with the same exponent and constant .    in its physical - space formulation ple can be supported by the following argument . from ( [ largexinit ] )",
    ", it follows that the characteristic velocity associated with a large separation @xmath44 is @xmath111 so that the corresponding `` turnover time '' , the characteristic time for significant changes through nonlinearity , is @xmath112 which grows without bound at large separations .",
    "hence , at any finite time , eddies of sufficiently large size should remain essentially as they were initially .",
    "this simple argument could be upset if two fluid particles , initially strongly correlated ( say , separated by not more than one initial integral scale ) , were to propagate this correlation to a large separation @xmath44 in a finite time . however , with gaussian initial conditions this occurrence has a very small probability , which can be bounded by @xmath113 $ ] , as explained in the footnote following the derivation of the constancy of @xmath84 ( eq .",
    "( [ correlator ] ) ) in the previous section .",
    "thus , the initial correlation function at large separations should remain unaffected to leading order .    in its fourier space formulation ,",
    "ple has already been proven in the previous section , for the case of the spectral index @xmath114 .",
    "when @xmath115 , ple is a consequence of the observation that the time - rate of change of the energy spectrum , the so - called transfer function , is typically proportional to @xmath5 at small wavenumbers , because of the beating interactions of pairs of fourier components with nearly opposite wavevectors .",
    "we may also derive the constancy of the coefficient of @xmath4 just from the constancy of the coefficient of @xmath116 at large @xmath44 .",
    "there are reasons why the two formulations are not quite equivalent .",
    "first , the @xmath114 result in fourier space is not an instance of ple in physical space . indeed ,",
    "when @xmath2 is an even integer , ( [ largexinit ] ) implies a non - analytic spectrum at small @xmath1 with logarithmic corrections .",
    "second , when @xmath11 and the initial correlation function has the behavior ( [ largexinit ] ) at large separations , the energy spectrum at any later time will begin with an analytic ( time - dependent ) @xmath5 term with a subleading non - analytic correction proportional to @xmath4 ( with a time - independent coefficient ) .",
    "we now show how ple , used as a `` boundary condition '' at large @xmath44 or small @xmath1 in connection with the self - similarity ansatz ( [ bsim ] ) and ( [ ult ] ) , allows us to derive the law of temporal variation of the integral scale and the energy .",
    "we first give the argument in physical space .",
    "let us assume that the distance beyond which ple applies is within the scope of the self - similarity formula ( [ bsim ] ) .",
    "it then immediately follows from ( [ bsim ] ) , ( [ ult ] ) and ( [ largexinit ] ) that @xmath117 and @xmath118 and thus , by ( [ ult ] ) , @xmath119    in fourier space the self - similarity ansatz ( [ ssimilarspectrum ] ) , together with ( [ initspecpowerlaw ] ) gives @xmath120 , since the later spectrum has now a @xmath5 dependence at small @xmath1 with a _ time - dependent _ coefficient .",
    "actually , we shall now show that the laws ( [ ltss ] ) and ( [ etss ] ) apply only when @xmath70 .",
    "we begin with the case @xmath9 when the initial potential has homogeneous increments .",
    "many aspects of this case are well understood , thanks in particular to burgers own work ( 1974 ; see also gurbatov _ et al .",
    "the phenomenology is quite simple .",
    "increments @xmath121 of the initial potential over a distance @xmath122 can be estimated from the square root of the structure function @xmath123 of the potential ( [ defstr ] ) . for a given position @xmath44 , the maximum in ( [ max])-([phifunction ] ) will come from those @xmath461 such that the change in potential is comparable to the change in the parabolic term @xmath124 at large times @xmath125 is also large and we can use ( [ asymptotics ] ) to obtain precisely ( [ ltss ] ) and , hence , the energy law ( [ etss ] ) .",
    "alternatively , we could argue that when @xmath45 is so large that the parabolas appearing in ( [ phifunction ] ) have a radius of curvature much larger than the typical radius of curvature of features in the initial potential , we can plausibly replace that initial potential by fractional brownian motion of exponent @xmath126 ( in order to be consistent with ( [ asymptotics ] ) ) . without loss of generality",
    "we may assume that this fractional brownian motion starts at the origin for @xmath127 .",
    "this function is then statistically invariant under the transformation @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "it is then elementary , using ( [ max])-([phifunction ] ) , to prove that a rescaling of the time is ( statistically ) equivalent to a suitable rescaling of @xmath44 distances and of @xmath130 .",
    "this implies ( [ ltss ] ) and ( [ etss ] ) .",
    "the case @xmath14 when the initial potential is homogeneous is more difficult .",
    "because of this homogeneity , the structure function becomes constant at large distances .",
    "if we then formally use ( [ following ] ) we obtain a @xmath131 law for the energy and a @xmath132 law for the integral scale .",
    "this is almost , but not quite , the right result .",
    "there are logarithmic corrections , first discovered by kida ( 1979 ) , which can actually be captured by phenomenology , as now explained .",
    "we shall estimate the energy in terms of the mean potential at @xmath127 , using ( [ energyevol ] ) and the maximum representation ( [ max])-([phifunction ] ) .",
    "we assume that , at long times @xmath45 , the distribution of values of the potential is peaked around its ( non - vanishing ) mean value @xmath133 .",
    "this quantity is thus the typical maximum value of @xmath134 .",
    "equivalently , we ask : what is the value @xmath135 by which we should vertically shift the parabola @xmath136 so that the graph of @xmath40 has a substantial probability of being everywhere below the shifted parabola ? to estimate this probability we divide the @xmath46-axis into equal intervals , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 ,  , with a common length of about one initial integral scale @xmath57 .",
    "the initial potential takes approximately independent values in the different intervals .",
    "thus , the probability of no intersection with the shifted parabola is ( approximately ) the product of the probabilities @xmath140 , @xmath141 ,  of no intersections in the various intervals : @xmath142 each of the @xmath1431 is of the form @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the probability of at least one intersection in the interval @xmath146 .",
    "this can be estimated as @xmath147 here , @xmath148 is the single - point cumulative probability of @xmath149 , integrated from @xmath150 to infinity and @xmath151 is any point in the interval @xmath146 , since the parabolic function changes very slowly with @xmath46 when @xmath45 is large .",
    "all the @xmath1451 are small and thus @xmath152 the sum of the @xmath1451 can be approximated by an integral from @xmath153 to @xmath154 .",
    "when @xmath155 is taken very large this integral is very small .",
    "as we decrease @xmath156 , the probability of having an intersection somewhere becomes significant when @xmath155 is chosen such that @xmath157    since we assumed gaussian initial conditions with r.m.s .",
    "value @xmath158,the cumulative probability @xmath148 is approximately @xmath159 $ ] .",
    "the leading order of the integral in ( [ intorder1 ] ) is obtained by keeping only the first two terms in the expansion of the square of @xmath160 .",
    "thereby , we obtain @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the characteristic nonlinear time . using ( [ energyevol ] ) , we then obtain the kida ( 1979 ) log - corrected @xmath12 law for the energy decay : @xmath163 finally , assuming ( [ ult ] ) , we obtain kida s ( 1979 ) result for the integral scale : @xmath164 we must , of course , stress that this derivation is only heuristic .",
    "we shall come back to the issue of a more systematic derivation ( sections  [ s : homogeneous ] and  [ s : correlations ] ) , including estimates of the subleading corrections .",
    "it is straightforward to extend this phenomenology to initial potentials which are homogeneous and non - gaussian , as the only ingredient used is the p.d.f .  of @xmath149 .",
    "for example , when the p.d.f .",
    "has a tail @xmath165 , the logarithmic correction to the @xmath12 law has the exponent @xmath166 .",
    "hence , when @xmath14 the law of decay could be very sensitive to the functional form of the p.d.f .  of the initial potential .",
    "such heuristic considerations for non - gaussian potentials have not yet been tested by more systematic theory and simulations .",
    "one of the most questionable aspects of our phenomenological derivation is its validity when @xmath2 is not an even integer . indeed , this gives rise to long - range algebraically decreasing correlations , which are neglected in this phenomenology and which kida ( 1979 ) explicitly ruled out .",
    "actually , we shall see in section  [ s : homogeneous ] that the kida law remains valid nevertheless as long as the initial potential is homogeneous , that is for any @xmath14",
    ".    100 10 artist s view of 3 regions in @xmath1-space .",
    "we now address for the first time one of the central issues of this paper . the predictions ( [ ltss ] ) and ( [ etss ] ) for @xmath167 and @xmath22 , obtained by assuming self - similarity and using ple as a `` boundary condition '' at large @xmath44 ( or small @xmath1 ) are not consistent with the kida law ( [ etphenokida])-([ltphenokida ] ) .",
    "because of the time - dependence of the coefficient of @xmath5 in the spectrum at small @xmath1 , the applicability of the former is obviously restricted to @xmath115 .",
    "since the latter applies when @xmath14 , there may be a contradiction in the region of overlap @xmath3 .",
    "actually , we shall see that @xmath14 leads to a self - similar decay of the solution in an `` inner '' region of not too large distances ( or , in fourier space , of not too small wavenumbers ) , controlled by the integral scale @xmath22 ( [ ltphenokida ] ) . in this",
    "inner region correlations of @xmath150 decrease like a gaussian function and the fourier signature is a range of wavenumbers at which the energy spectrum is @xmath168 .",
    "in addition , if @xmath14 and is not an even integer , there exists an `` outer '' frozen region at which ple applies .",
    "thus , there is , at very large distances , an algebraic tail in the correlation function and the spectrum has a time - independent @xmath4 contribution at small @xmath1 . when @xmath3 this is the leading term at small @xmath1 so that the complete spectrum has three ranges : proportional to @xmath4 at very small @xmath1 , then proportional to @xmath5 at intermediate wavenumbers ( up to approximately the inverse of the integral scale @xmath22 ) and , finally , proportional to @xmath6 at high @xmath1 ( the usual signature of shocks ) , as shown in fig .",

    "the small-@xmath1 inner - region behavior of the spectrum is thus @xmath368 where @xmath369 instead of a gaussian region ( in physical space ) , we have a spectrum with an algebraic @xmath5 region and a time - dependent coefficient @xmath370 .",
    "we must now distinguish two cases .",

    "the switching wavenumber @xmath373 , obtained by equating ( [ eleft ] ) and ( [ eksmall ] ) , is given by @xmath374 some comments are now made .",
    "first , it may seem paradoxical that the switching wavenumber @xmath373 is not the inverse of the switching distance @xmath363 .",
    "the reason is that in physical space we have a gaussian competing with a power law , whereas in fourier space we have two power laws competing ; this renders inapplicable nave fourier phenomenology in which distances are roughly inverse wavenumbers .",
    "second , let us define an energy wavenumber @xmath375 , which is roughly the wavenumber around which most of the kinetic energy resides . from ( [ ltasymptotic ] ) @xmath376 ( ignoring logarithmic corrections ) .",
    "we then have from ( [ ksasympt ] ) , still ignoring logarithmic corrections : @xmath377 hence , the switching wavenumber goes to zero much faster than the energy wavenumber : in fourier space the separation of the two regions is much more manifest .",
    "this is why the results of the numerical simulations in section  [ s : numerics ] will be presented in fourier space .",
    "let us also observe that the ratio of the energy in the outer region to the total energy , a measure of how well the kida law is satisfied , is equal to @xmath378 ( up to logarithms ) and thus becomes very small when @xmath379 , unless @xmath2 is very close to unity .",
    "thus , we have established the central claim of this paper , namely that for @xmath3 there is no globally self - similar evolution of the energy spectrum .",
    "of course , as @xmath380 the inner @xmath5 region overwhelms the outer @xmath4 region and as @xmath381 the converse happens , so that in both instances global self - similarity tends to be reestablished .",
    "the purpose of this section is to obtain numerical confirmation of the rather unusual long - time regime predicted by the theory when the spectral exponent @xmath2 is between one and two .",
    "there should then be three different power - law regions in the energy spectrum : @xmath382 \\ds e(k ) \\propto |k|^2\\quad { \\rm for}\\,\\ , k_s(t)\\ll |k|\\ll l^{-1}(t);\\\\[1.6ex ] \\ds e(k ) \\propto |k|^n\\quad { \\rm for}\\,\\ , |k|\\ll k_s(t ) , \\end{array } \\label{3regions}\\ ] ] where @xmath373 and @xmath22 are given by ( [ ksasympt ] ) and ( [ ltasymptotic ] ) , respectively .",
    "clearly , such simulations require extremely high spatial resolution since three power - law ranges are present .",
    "fortunately , for the burgers equation there is no need to numerically integrate ( [ burgers ] ) : advantage can be taken of the maximum representation ( [ phifunction ] ) to directly construct , from the initial data , the solution in the limit of vanishing viscosity at any given time @xmath45 .",

    "the method exploits two observations .",
    "first , the maximum representation ( [ phifunction ] ) becomes a legendre transformation after expansion of the quadratic term .",
    "second , when the problem is discretized on a grid of @xmath184 points , the search for the maximizing lagrangian point @xmath383 can be done by a dichotomic procedure which uses the non - decreasing property of the inverse lagrangian map .",
    "the number of operations can thus be reduced from a brute - force estimate @xmath384 to @xmath385 .    in the simulations it is of course necessary to introduce both large - scale and small - scale cutoffs .",
    "the small - scale cutoff must be chosen sufficiently small compared to the integral scale to leave room for a @xmath6 inertial range . since the integral scale grows with the time , this constraint is not very stringent . in practice , we take the initial integral scale about a factor ten larger than the mesh .    for the large - scale cutoff ,",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions which facilitate fourier transformations and make no significant difference as long as we analyse scales much smaller than the spatial periodicity .    in our simulations ,",
    "the maximum wavenumber is taken to be @xmath386 , so that wavevectors run from @xmath387 to @xmath388 , where @xmath184 is the resolution , that is the number of grid points in physical space . in all our simulations",

    "after the solutions at suitable output times have been constructed with the procedure described above , they are fourier transformed and their energy spectra are calculated by averaging typically over @xmath397 realizations .",
    "the precise value of the spectral exponent @xmath3 in our runs depends , of course , on the particular tradeoffs desired : the closer @xmath2 is to 1 , the more conspicuous is the persistence of the initial @xmath4 range ; and the closer it is to 2 , the more conspicuous is the ( nonlinearly generated ) @xmath5 range .",
    "a natural unit for the output times is @xmath398 .",
    "indeed , we know from ( [ ltasymptotic ] ) that the integral scale grows roughly as @xmath132 . thus @xmath399 is roughly the time needed for the integral scale to grow from an initial value @xmath355 to a value comparable to the largest scale available in the simulation , which is @xmath400 . in practice ,",
