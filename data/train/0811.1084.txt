    "the theory of subfactors ( @xcite ) has experienced several new developments in the last few years through the introduction of planar algebra technology ( @xcite ) .",
    "every subfactor comes with a very rich mathematical object , the _ standard invariant _ or _",
    "planar algebra _ of the subfactor , which in nice situations is a complete invariant of the subfactor ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it can be described in many interesting ways , as for instance a certain category of bimodules ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) , as lattices of multi - matrix algebras ( @xcite ) , or as a planar algebra ( @xcite ) .",
    "the planar algebra approach is particularly powerful since it allows one to use algebraic - combinatorial methods in conjunction with topological ones to investigate the structure of subfactors .",
    "a number of examples of explicit planar algebras associated to subfactors have been computed ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) but there is a need for more concrete examples .",
    "this is what we accomplish in this paper .",
    "we give a description of the planar algebra of the diagonal subfactors associated to a @xmath0-kernel .",
    "let @xmath3 be a ii@xmath2 factor and let @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 be automorphisms of @xmath3 ( we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath7 ) .",
    "consider the subfactor @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denote matrix units in @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is then called the _ diagonal subfactor _ associated to @xmath12 .",
    "these subfactors were proposed by jones in 1985 to provide examples of potentially non - classifiable subfactors , since this construction allows one to translate problems on classification of group actions into problems on subfactors .",
    "popa used them to prove vanishing of 2-cohomology results for cocycle actions of finitely generated , strongly amenable groups on an arbitrary ii@xmath2 factor ( @xcite ) .",
    "ocneanu had proved such a result for cocycle actions of amenable groups on the hyperfinite ii@xmath2 factor using different techniques ( @xcite ) .",
    "the diagonal subfactors are of course reducible and have jones index @xmath13 .",
    "they provide a wealth of simple examples of infinite depth subfactors whose structure theory is well understood .",
    "in particular , the standard invariant or planar algebra of these subfactors has been determined in ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be the group generated by the images @xmath14 of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , in @xmath17 .",
    "popa showed that analytical properties of these subfactors are reflected in the corresponding properties of the group @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath3 is hyperfinite , then the diagonal subfactor is amenable ( in the sense of popa ) if and only if @xmath0 is an amenable group ( @xcite ) .",
    "the subfactor has property ( t ) in the sense of popa if and only if @xmath0 has property ( t ) of kazhdan ( @xcite ) .",
    "the principal graphs of these subfactors are then cayley - like graphs of @xmath0 with respect to the generators @xmath18 , @xmath5 , @xmath19 and their inverses ( see @xcite or @xcite for the precise statement ) .",
    "the higher relative commutants , jones projections and conditional expectations have all been worked out in ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a well - known variation of the diagonal subfactors is obtained as follows ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "consider a @xmath0-kernel , that is an injective homomorphism @xmath20 from a ( countable , discrete , finitely generated ) group @xmath0 into @xmath21 .",
    "denote by @xmath22 the canonical homomorphism , and let @xmath23 be a lift of @xmath20 such that @xmath24 , for all @xmath25 .",
    "it follows that @xmath26 , for all @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and some unitaries @xmath29 .",
    "associativity of composition of automorphisms implies that @xmath30 . hence there is a function @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath1 is a 3-cocycle and that its class in @xmath33 does not depend on the choices made .",
    "one usually denotes the class by @xmath34 or @xmath35 , the _ obstruction _ of @xmath20 .",
    "it is an obstruction to lifting @xmath0 to an _ action _ on the ii@xmath2 factor @xmath3 . clearly , if two @xmath0-kernels @xmath20 and @xmath36 are conjugate ( in @xmath21 ) , then @xmath37 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath38 is a complete conjugacy invariant for @xmath0-kernels if @xmath3 is the hyperfinite ii@xmath2 factor and @xmath0 is a countable , discrete , amenable group . note that in general , even if @xmath39 , there may be no lifting of the @xmath0-kernel to an action on @xmath3 .",
    "connes and jones found in @xcite the first such example of a non - liftable @xmath0-kernel with vanishing obstruction , where @xmath0 is a group with property ( t ) .",
    "vanishing of the obstruction is a necessary and sufficient condition for @xmath0 to lift to a _ cocycle action _ on the ii@xmath2 factor @xmath3 .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for more on this .",
    "connes showed that if @xmath0 is cyclic , one can construct @xmath0-kernels in @xmath40 with arbitrary obstructions , where @xmath41 denotes the _ hyperfinite _ ii@xmath2 factor ( @xcite ) .",
    "it was an open problem whether this result is true for more general groups , and jones showed in @xcite that this is indeed the case for @xmath0 an arbitrary discrete group .",
    "thus , given a discrete group @xmath0 and a class @xmath42 , there is @xmath0-kernel @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "sutherland constructed @xmath0-kernels with arbitrary obstructions in non - hyperfinite ii@xmath2 factors ( @xcite ) .    given a finitely generated , countable group @xmath0 and a 3-cocycle @xmath1 , we can associate a ( hyperfinite ) subfactor to @xmath45 as follows .",
    "let @xmath46 be a @xmath0-kernel with @xmath47 \\in h^3(g , \\mathbb t)$ ] ( choose for instance @xmath48 , and use @xcite ) .",
    "fix generators @xmath49 of g , let @xmath50 be a lift of @xmath20 , and consider the diagonal subfactor associated to the automorphisms @xmath51 , @xmath5 , @xmath52 ( let us choose @xmath53 , the identity of @xmath0 , and @xmath54 ) . if @xmath36 is another @xmath0-kernel with lift @xmath55 , and automorphisms @xmath56 , @xmath5 , @xmath57 , then the diagonal subfactors associated to @xmath58 and @xmath59 are isomorphic if and only if there is an automorphism @xmath60 of the underlying ii@xmath2 factor @xmath3 such that @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a permutation of the indices ( fixing @xmath63 ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) . thus , in particular , isomorphism of these diagonal subfactors implies that @xmath64 ( up to a possible modification of @xmath20 by the permutation @xmath62 ) .",
    "isomorphism of standard invariants is weaker than isomorphism of subfactors , but we still have the following . if @xmath65 and @xmath66 are two @xmath0-kernels as above with @xmath67 , then the standard invariants of the associated diagonal subfactors are isomorphic ( see ( @xcite , page 228 ff . ) .",
    "the converse is not true due to the fact that group isomorphisms can change the class of a 3-cocycle .",
    "if one constructs diagonal subfactors where the automorphisms are repeated with distinct multiplicities , one can show a converse , e.g. if @xmath0 is strongly amenable and @xmath3 is hyperfinite , using popa s classification results of amenable subfactors ( @xcite , page 229 ff . ) .",
    "clearly , the 3-cocycle @xmath1 giving rise to the obstruction of the @xmath0-kernel will appear in the standard invariant of these diagonal subfactors ( with cocycle ) and the purpose of this paper is to give a precise description of this occurrence .",
    "here is a more detailed outline of the sections of this paper .",
    "we review group cocycles in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "we define an abstract planar algebra @xmath68 associated to a finitely generated group @xmath0 with a fixed finite generating set @xmath69 , and a 3-cocycle @xmath70 .",
    "the vector spaces underlying this planar algebra are spanned by multi - indices in @xmath71 such that the corresponding alternating word on generators and their inverses is the identity in @xmath0 .",
    "the action of jones planar operad is defined explicity , and of course @xmath1 appears prominently in this definition .",
    "it should be noted that the definition of the action of a tangle involves a labelling of the _ strings _ in the tangle whereas the planar algebra description of the group - type subfactors in @xcite involved a labelling of _ boundary segments _ ( called `` openings '' in @xcite ) of the internal and external discs of the tangle .",
    "we would like to point out that the 3-cocycle @xmath1 does not appear in our definition of the action of the multiplication , inclusion , jones projection and right conditional expectation tangles .",
    "it does appear in the definition of the action of the left conditional expectation tangles ( and hence the rotation tangles ) .",
    "we verify in this section that our definition of the action of tangles is indeed natural with respect to composition of tangles .",
    "this takes a little work , but some interesting identities for 3-cocycles appear along the way .    in section 4",
    "we give a model for the higher relative commutants of the diagonal subfactor with cocycle and describe the associated concrete planar algebra .",
    "we choose an appropriate basis of the higher relative commutants which allows us to identify this concrete planar algebra with the abstractly defined one in section 3 .",
    "this isomorphism is obtained in the usual way by constructing a filtered @xmath72-algebra isomorphism between the abstract planar algebra of section 3 and the concrete one of section 4 , that preserves jones projection and conditional expectation tangles .",
    "the main feature of this planar algebra is the fact that the distinguished basis of the higher relative commutants that we found here , matches with the one coming from the description of the planar algebra as a path algebra associated to the principal graphs of the subfactor ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , we prove that any finite index extremal subfactor whose standard invariant is given by the abstract planar algebra ( in section 3 ) , must necessarily be ( isomorphic to ) a diagonal subfactor .",
    "for the convenience of the reader , we recall in this brief section the definition of a cocycle of a group @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath0 will denote throughout this article a countable , discrete group , and we will denote the identity of @xmath0 by @xmath73 . define @xmath74 the space of functions from @xmath75 to @xmath76 and @xmath77 by + @xmath78 it follows that @xmath79 where @xmath63 denotes the constant function @xmath63 .",
