    "hydrodynamic approach is well established for description of hot and dense matter created in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "its success is based on reproduction of bulk observables such as radial flow , elliptic and higher order flow harmonics @xcite , femtoscopy @xcite etc .  in so - called hybrid models coupling viscous ( or inviscid )",
    "hydrodynamic phase to a hadron cascade .",
    "in this paper we report on the application of the viscous+cascade model tuned to full rhic energy to heavy ion collisions at lower collision energies . to accommodate the different collision energy regime",
    ", we change the equation of state ( eos ) and the initial conditions , and keep all the other parameters fixed .",
    "the approximation of boost - invariant scaling flow is well - justified for hydrodynamic evolution of matter around midrapidity interval at top rhic energies and above .",
    "however one should not pursue this assumption at lower energies , since at @xmath3 gev and below it becomes invalid because of the absence of plateau in rapidity distribution of produced particles .",
    "we avoid this issue by using rapidity - dependent initial conditions together with 3d hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "the model employed in the present studies consists of components , each corresponding to the certain stage of nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "the space - time picture is sketched on fig .",

    "* ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) model @xcite is used for the description of initial stage dynamics .",
    "the two nuclei are initialized according to wood - saxon distributions and the binary interactions are taken into account until a hypersurface at constant @xmath5 .",
    "we run urqmd many times to get smooth averaged 3-dimensional distribution of particles which cross this hypersurface .",
    "the energy and momentum of particles is then converted to energy and momentum densities of the fluid .",
    "in addition to energy / momentum densities , initial baryon and charge densities are non - zero and obtained from urqmd , evolved in the hydro stage and accounted for in the particlization procedure . on the other hand , net strangeness density",
    "is set to zero",
    ".    * hydrodynamic phase .",
    "* we start the hydrodynamic phase at @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a radius of nucleus and @xmath8 is a nucleon mass .",
    "this corresponds to the time when the two nuclei have passed through each other .",
    "the values of starting time for different collision energies are shown on fig .",
    "[ figevolution ] , right .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations are then solved in milne ( @xmath9 ) coordinates .",
    "another important ingredient of the model relevant to lower collision energies is the equation of state ( eos ) for finite baryon density .",
    "we employ the chiral model based eos @xcite , which features correct asymptotic degrees of freedom , i.e. quarks and gluons at high temperature and hadrons in the low - temperature limits , crossover - type transition between confined and deconfined matter for all values of @xmath10 and qualitatively agrees with lattice qcd data at @xmath11 .",
    "we employ israel - stewart framework for relativistic viscous hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "several variants of israel - stewart equations exist in literature , the differences between them coming from slightly different assumptions in the derivation @xcite .",
    "in particular we stick to the following choice for equations for the shear stress tensor : @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes covariant derivative and the brackets @xmath14 denote the symmetric , traceless and orthogonal to @xmath15 part of @xmath16 . for the purpose of the current study",
    "we consider only the effects of shear viscosity , fixing bulk viscosity to zero , @xmath17 .",
    "we do not include the baryon / electric charge diffusion either .",
    "for viscous hydro simulations , we initialize the shear stress tensor to zero . the relaxation time for shear , @xmath18 ,",
    "is taken as @xmath19 .",
    "* particlization and hadron corona . * motivated by previous studies at @xmath20 a gev rhic and lhc energies @xcite , we fix the transition from fluid to particle description ( so - called particlization ) to take place at the constant energy density @xmath21  gev/@xmath22 , when the relevant degrees of freedom are hadrons .",
    "cornelius subroutine @xcite is used to calculate the 3-volume elements @xmath23 of the transition hypersurface .",
    "it is important to note that while we use fixed energy density as transition criterion for all collision energies , the average net baryon density increases with decreasing collision energy .",
    "this corresponds to the increase of average temperature and decrease of baryon chemical potential with increasing collision energy , resembling the results for the collision energy dependence of chemical freezeout parameters from thermal model studies @xcite .",
    "since the eos used has features ( mean field , ) which somewhat shift the values of thermodynamic quantities from those in free hadron - resonance gas ( hrg ) approximation , we switch to free hrg eos to sample the hadrons according to cooper - frye prescription .",
    "we recalculate the energy density , pressure , flow velocity and corresponding thermodynamical quantities from energy - momentum tensor using free hrg eos , and employ them when sampling . to account for the effect of shear viscosity , we use the same corrections to the local equilibrium distribution functions for all hadron species : @xmath24\\ ] ]    finally , urqmd code is employed to calculate the further evolution of the hadron corona .",
    "we fix most of the parameters of the model as described above .",
    "the only free parameter left is the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath25 in hydro stage .",
    "finally we perform simulations corresponding to various collision energy and @xmath26 values .",
    "since a bulk of data from sps exists for different observables ( @xmath27 , @xmath28-distributions , pion femtoscopy ) one can first check how well the overall collective matter dynamics is described in the model .",
    "thus we simulate pb - pb collisions at energies @xmath29 and @xmath30  a  gev ( i.e.  @xmath31  gev ) , and compare @xmath1 and @xmath27 distributions with the data from na49 collaboration .    with decreasing beam energy ,",
    "passage time calculated according to ( [ eqtau0 ] ) increases , whereas the average initial energy density for hydrodynamic expansion becomes smaller .",
    "the latter leads to shorter duration of hydro phase , provided that the criterion for fluid to particle transition is kept the same .",
    "consequently , at the lowest sps energy ( @xmath32  gev ) the lifetimes of pre - hydro ( 4.1 fm / c ) and hydro stages are comparable , and pre - hydrodynamic stage gives significant contribution to the development of transverse flow .",

    "[ figdndy ] .",

    "the longitudinal expansion is weaker , and the expansion tends to be more spherical , as seen in the comparison of the @xmath28-spectra , fig . [ figpt ] : @xmath28-spectra become flatter , which is due to stronger transverse expansion and larger radial flow .",
