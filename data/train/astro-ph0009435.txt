    "the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _ ( _ asca _  tanaka , inoue , and holt 1994 ) found that the @xmath0 fluorescent emission line in seyfert  1 galaxies is often very broad and the data are consistent with an interpretation of an origin from cold matter in an accretion disk rotating around a central black hole ( see fabian _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the line profile is sculpted by characteristic gravitational and doppler energy shifts . currently , study of the @xmath0 emission line is the only way to probe matter within a few to tens of gravitational radii of a black hole .",
    "these emission features become less common in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with a 210 kev intrinsic luminosity exceeding @xmath10 ( or synonymously , quasars ) . on the few occasions that an @xmath0 line is detected in high - luminosity agn it appears to be narrow ( fwhm @xmath11 km / s ) with a peak energy indicative of highly - ionized matter .",
    "this trend is discussed in nandra _",
    "( 1997a , b ) , reeves _ et al . _ ( 2000 ) and george _ et al . _ ( 2000 ) and references therein .    the bright , high - luminosity ( @xmath12 ; @xmath13 and @xmath14 throughout ) radio - loud quasar 3c  273 ( @xmath15 ) has been extensively studied in all wavebands ( e.g. see von montigny _",
    "_ 1997 ; trler _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , x - ray studies have found a featureless nonthermal continuum , with the occasional detection of an @xmath0 emission line .",
    "proportional counter experiments such as those on _",
    "exosat _ and _ ginga _ could not constrain the width of the line and , for a narrow line assumption , found equivalent widths of @xmath16 ev when it was detected ( e.g. turner _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ; williams _ et al .",
    "subsequent observations with _ asca _ again found some weak detections with an equivalent width of the order of tens of ev ( yaqoob _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; cappi _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; reeves _ et al .",
    "observations with _ bepposax _ told a similar story ( grandi _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; orr _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; haardt _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) .    in these",
    "_ asca _ and _ bepposax _ studies , the @xmath0 line in 3c 273 has been assumed or claimed to be narrow .",
    "however , on two occasions ( 1996 july and 1998 june ) , during coordinated _ asca _ , _ rxte _ and _ bepposax _ multi - mission cross - calibration campaigns , we found that the @xmath0 line was in fact broad .",
    "this is not inconsistent with previously published results because when the equivalent width of the line is small it is very difficult to constrain the intrinsic width .",
    "results from the 1996 july and subsequent _ asca _ observations have not yet been published . as for the _ bepposax _ results ( grandi _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; haardt _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , recalibration of the _ mecs _ aboard _ bepposax _ has recently brought the narrow width of the line into question ( grandi , private communication ) . in this _",
    "letter _ we re - examine the old _ asca _ data , and present results from three new _ asca _ observations , plus two simultaneous rxte observations , in order to investigate the nature of the elusive @xmath0 emission line in this source and we conclude that it is broad , just like that found in seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "between 1993 , june and 2000 , january , there were a total of six _ asca _ campaigns on 3c 273 , resulting in twelve pointed observations .",
    "two observations have simultaneous _ rxte _ data ( 1996 july and 1998 june ) .",
    "table 1 shows an observation log , exposure times and count rates for these observations .",
    "we utilize all four instruments aboard _ asca _ ( sis and gis ) , fitting the same model to all detectors simultaneously with only the relative normalizations independent .",
    "all the sis data were taken in 1-ccd mode .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "data were analysed using the methods described in detail in yaqoob _",
    "note that observation b was a calibration observation performed in four parts , placing the source sequentially on each of the four sis chips over a period of @xmath17 days .",
    "observation c was a multiple ` snapshot ' science campaign carried out over @xmath18 days .",
    "preliminary spectral fitting showed that we could not obtain useful constraints on the @xmath0 line parameters from the separate pointings due to insufficient signal - to - noise so we combined the spectra from individual pointings for each of the data sets `` b '' and `` c '' . for _ rxte _ we used only the proportional counter array ( pca ) data , which were reduced using methods described in weaver , krolik , & pier ( 1998 ) , except that we used a later version of the spectral response matrix ( v 7.01 ) and background model ( ` l7_240_faint ' ) . only data from pcu 0,1 and 2",
    ", layer 1 were used in this analysis . note that cross - calibration studies show that in the 210 kev band pca fluxes are systematically at least 20% higher than _ asca _ whereas _ asca _ and _ bepposax _ fluxes agree to a few percent .",
    "we will rely on the _ asca _ fluxes for consistency since we discuss only two _ rxte _ observations .    since we are only interested in the @xmath0 line properties for this work , we only utilize data in the 1.510 kev band for _ asca _ and 310 kev band for the pca ( the latter does not have a useful response below 3 kev ) .",
    "first , we fitted each data set with a simple power - law plus galactic absorption ( @xmath19 ; dickey & lockman 1990 ) , but omitting data between 48 kev ( the fe - k line region ) .",
    "visual inspection of the data / model residuals over the whole energy range then revealed , in most cases , a hump peaking around 5.5 kev ( observed frame ) , presumably due to an @xmath0 emission line .",
    "the most dramatic of these was for observation d , for which the sis , gis and pca data / model ratios are shown in figure 1 .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath0 line is very broad , extending from @xmath20 kev similar to the broad @xmath0 lines in seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "we emphasize that this is not a result of instrument calibration problems .",
    "the line is broad as measured by five independent instruments , out of which three instrument groups ( sis , gis and pca ) were calibrated independently in the relevant energy band .",
    "we show below that even the pca , despite its poor energy resolution resolves the @xmath0 line at 90% confidence . before discussing quantitative measurements of the line parameters we show in figure 2 similar data / model ratios resulting from co - adding all the sis0 and sis1 data in table 1 .",
    "this constitutes _ all _ the sis data for 3c 273 taken over the entire lifetime of _ asca _ , amounting to an exposure time of @xmath21 ks .",
    "the broad @xmath0 line can be seen with very high signal - to - noise .",
    "it is not meaningful to perform more detailed spectral fitting on the co - added spectra because it is known that the spectral index of the continuum is variable over long timescales ( turner _ et al . _ 1990 ) so we will not utilize the co - added spectrum further .",
    "note that in figure 2 , at the highest energies ( above @xmath22 kev ) , the sis1 data are systematically higher than sis0 .",
    "this is a known calibration uncertainty which shows up in other sources when the signal - to - noise is high .",
    "we then fitted each of the eight data sets ( six _ asca _ and two _ rxte _ ) with a simple power - law model ( including galactic absorption ) and a gaussian to model the line , utilizing all the data in the selected energy bands ( _ asca _ : 1.510 kev , pca : 310 kev ) .",
    "there were a maximum of three free parameters associated with the line ; the line center energy ( @xmath23 ) , intrinsic gaussian width ( @xmath24 ) , and intensity ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we found that all except observations d/ pca and e/ _ asca _ had insufficient signal - noise to constrain both the center energy and intrinsic width simultaneously so we fixed @xmath24 at 0.8 kev ( consistent with the best fitting values from observations d/ pca and e/ _ asca _ ) . in cases",
    "where the line was particularly weak we also had to fix @xmath23 ( at 6.67 kev , from the best - constrained measurement which was from observation e/_asca _ ) .",
    "the spectral fitting results are shown in table 2 , which also shows the values of @xmath26 compared to the case when no @xmath0 line was included in the model .",
    "clearly , the line is detected with a very high level of confidence ( for the two _ worst _ cases it is @xmath27 and @xmath28 for observations b and f respectively ) .",
    "note that in observations d/_asca _ and e / pca the line is actually resolved at the 90% confidence level .",
    "the best - fitting line energies from _ asca _ are all @xmath29 kev , and the weighted mean , from the _ asca _ observations that could constrain the energy , is @xmath30 kev .",
    "the statistical uncertainty is still sufficiently large that all ionization states of fe except h - like are allowed .",
    "previous work has shown that a compton - reflection continuum , common in seyfert 1 galaxies , is particularly weak in 3c 273 ( e.g. turner _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ; grandi _ et al .",
    "nevertheless , we tested whether compton - reflection could affect the deduced width of the @xmath0 line . using the _ asca _ data with the best - determined line width ( observation e )",
    ", we added a compton - reflection continuum to the power - law plus gaussian model .",
    "for the most conservative constraints we assumed the primary x - ray continuum illuminates a compton - thick disk viewed face - on .",
    "the only additional free parameter is the effective covering factor of the disk , @xmath31 , as a fraction of of the solid angle @xmath32 .",
    "the best - fitting value of @xmath31 was 0.0 , with a 90% confidence upper limit of 0.20 ( four interesting parameters , or @xmath33 ) .",
    "thus , the best - fitting line parameters remained unchanged , with the bounds on the line width slightly larger , ( @xmath34 kev ) .",
    "thus , compton reflection does not affect our conclusion about the broadness of the @xmath0 line .",
    "we used the pca data for observation e to obtain even tighter constraints on compton - reflection .",
    "using the same model , and extending the pca data up to 20 kev , we obtained @xmath35 with an upper limit of 0.094 ( 90% confidence , @xmath36 ; recall that the line width had to be fixed for the pca / e data ) .",
    "as can be seen from table 2 , the smallest and largest measurements of @xmath25 are for observations a and f respectively and do not overlap at the 90% confidence level , yet these observations have 210 kev fluxes which differ by only @xmath37 . observations a and f also have the smallest and largest ew respectively , which are also mutually exclusive at the 90% confidence level .",
    "however , a clear trend in the line variability is not apparent from these data ; studies with _ xmm _ will clarify this issue .    since the broad @xmath0 emission line ( figures 1 and 2 ) is similar to that seen in many seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. nandra _ et al .",
    "_ 1997a ; reynolds 1997 ) we fitted the",
    "data with a model in which the line photons are emitted in a disk rotating around a central schwarzschild black hole ( e.g. fabian _ et al .",
    "the parameters are @xmath38 ( inclination angle of the disk normal relative to the observer ) , @xmath39 ( inner radius ) , @xmath40 ( outer radius ) , @xmath41 ( power - law index characterizing the line emissivity as @xmath42 ) , @xmath43 ( intensity ) , and @xmath44 ( line energy in the disk rest frame ) .",
    "the fits were insensitive to @xmath39 and @xmath40 so they were fixed at @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the data could not constrain @xmath41 so we fixed it at 2.5 , a value consistent with the mean found from a sample of seyfert galaxies ( e.g. nandra _ et al . _",
    "unfortunately there is too much interplay between @xmath44 and the other line parameters so we fixed @xmath44 at 6.4 kev , corresponding to a cold disk .",
    "thus there are at most two free parameters in this model of the @xmath0 line ( @xmath48 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "moreover , we found that only observations d and e could constrain @xmath38 , so for the other fits we fixed @xmath38 at the best - fitting value for observation d. the results are shown in table 3 . both observations d and e",
    "give a consistent value for @xmath38 of @xmath9 , with a lower bound of @xmath49 ( the upper value is not bounded ) .",
    "this is somewhat surprising because quasars such as 3c 273 are thought to be observed face - on ( or near face - on ) . to investigate",
    "whether a higher rest - frame energy of the @xmath0 line can lower the inclination angle , we repeated the spectral fits with the rest energy fixed at the extreme value of 6.97 kev ( corresponding to h - like fe ) and obtained @xmath50 and @xmath51 degrees for observations d and e respectively .",
    "however , the fits are slightly _ worse _ , with @xmath26 between 23 .",
    "thus we can not unambiguously constrain the inclination angle and require better data , from _ xmm _ for example .",
    "note that ew values from the disk model ( for both values of the rest - frame energy ) are virtually the same as those obtained from the gaussian model .",
    "it should also be pointed out that in no case does the disk - line model formally provide a better fit than the gaussian model ( but the differences in @xmath52 are not significant ) .",
    "from an analysis of the entire database of _ asca _ observations of 3c 273 and two simultaneous _ rxte _ observations , we have shown that the @xmath0 line in this quasar is very broad .",
    "the line is resolved in two of the observations with a mean gaussian width of @xmath5 kev , corresponding to a fwhm of @xmath53 .",
    "the 210 kev intrinsic luminosity ranged from @xmath54 . the smallest and largest equivalent widths we measured are @xmath55 ev and @xmath8 ev respectively ( quasar frame ) but the data do not allow us to identify any clear trend of line variability and its relation to the continuum luminosity . the broad @xmath0 line is similar to the relativistic @xmath0 lines commonly found in seyfert  1 galaxies , which are thought to be shaped by gravitational and doppler shifts in the vicinity of a black hole .",
    "the ew of the lines in seyfert  1 galaxies is higher however , typically @xmath56 ev . the @xmath0 emission line was previously thought to be narrow ( fwhm @xmath57 km / s ) or absent in agn with a 210 kev luminosity exceeding @xmath58 .",
    "thus , 3c 273 is now the highest luminosity quasar in which a broad @xmath0 line has been found . when modeled by a gaussian , the weighted mean peak energy of the line is @xmath30 kev , indicative of he - like fe , although the 90% confidence errors allow all lower ionization states .",
    "if we model the @xmath0 line in 3c 273 as originating in an accretion disk around a black hole , we obtain a disk inclination angle @xmath59 if the @xmath0 line originates in cold matter .",
    "if the line - emitting region is highly ionized the disk inclination angle is allowed to be smaller , including near face - on for h - like fe .",
    "the disk model also predicts that the @xmath0 line should be accompanied by a compton - reflection continuum , but we constrained the magnitude of the latter to be less than 10% of that expected from a face - on , semi - infinite , compton - thick disk centrally illuminated by the primary x - ray continuum .",
    "the ew during some of the observations is too large compared to that predicted for the observed reflection continuum ( e.g. see george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "time lags longer than several days between line and continuum and/or an over - abundance of fe could reduce this discrepancy .",
    "time - resolved spectroscopy with _ xmm _ is needed to make further progress .",
