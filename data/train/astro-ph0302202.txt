    "much information is expected from ongoing and future experiments aimed at measuring the cmb radiation . in this framework ,",
    "a considerable amount of attention has been drawn in the recent literature by gaussianity tests on cmb data .",
    "such tests have been motivated by the prediction of the so - called theory of inflation , currently the most popular theory of the very early universe .",
    "standard inflation predicts that the temperature fluctuations of the cmb , should be ( very close to ) gaussian distributed ( see the reviews @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    "more recent , non - standard models of inflation predict small non - gaussianities ; detecting such effects would be important for understanding the physics of the primordial epochs @xcite .",
    "more radical deviations from gaussianity are predicted by models where topological defects are induced by phase transitions ( see ref.@xcite for a review ) .",
    "detecting non - gaussianities is also relevant as a tool for controlling systematic effects in cmb data . among the many procedures advocated in the literature ,",
    "many are based upon topological properties of spherical gaussian fields @xcite ; others are based on harmonic space properties @xcite for empirical results , see @xcite . + in a recent paper @xcite we proposed a new procedure to detect non - gaussianity in harmonic space using so - called empirical processes @xcite .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath1 denote the cmb fluctuations field , which we assume , as always , to be homogeneous and isotropic , for @xmath2 @xmath3 . assuming that @xmath4 has zero mean and finite second moments",
    ", it is well - known that the following spectral representation holds : @xmath5where @xmath6 denotes the spherical harmonics .",
    "the random coefficients ( amplitudes ) @xmath7 have zero - mean with variance @xmath8 .",
    "they are uncorrelated over @xmath9 and @xmath10 : @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the sequence @xmath13 denotes the angular power spectrum of the random field and the asterisk complex conjugation .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath1 is gaussian , the @xmath14 have a complex gaussian distribution . upon observing @xmath4 on the full sky",
    ", the random coefficients can be obtained through the inversion formula@xmath15 our idea in that paper was to study the empirical distribution function for the @xmath16 and to use these results to implement tests for non - gaussianity in harmonic space , in the presence of an unknown angular power spectrum .",
    "although the monte carlo evidence produced in @xcite was rather encouraging , several important issues were left for further research .",
    "indeed , it must be noted that although the joint distribution of the spherical harmonic coefficients is invariant under rotations ( under gaussianity ) , their numerical value is not ; as a result , the sample outcome of the test in @xcite is not rotationally invariant . in this paper",
    "this remark is exploited to implement an extended , more powerful version of the empirical process procedure , based upon the combination of results from several different choices of coordinate systems .",
    "furthermore , empirical process ideas are also implemented in four different setups : whereas in @xcite we focused only on the squared spherical harmonic coefficients , here we consider also the real and imaginary parts as separate random variables , which allows us to gain further efficiency improvements .",
    "more important , we consider the empirical process on the random phases of the gaussian field .",
    "this approach is especially convenient , because under gaussianity not only the random phases are model independent ( compare @xcite ) but the smirnov uniformization ( see below ) is exact , i.e. no bias arises .",
    "moreover the joint information on the random phases and the random amplitudes uniquely identifies the distribution of the field , under gaussianity .",
    "we address also some experimentally meaningful situations , such as the presence of instrumental noise and a galactic cut in the map ; concerning the latter , we advocate a solution which may have some independent interest for other harmonic space methods of statistical inference .",
    "our tests are implemented on models of non - gaussianity based upon ongoing research on non - standard inflationary models .",
    "+ the plan of the paper is as follows : in section ( [ sect : method ] ) we review the empirical process method ; the extensions provided in this paper are presented in ( [ sect : improvements ] ) .",
    "section ( [ sect : results ] ) presents the results from monte - carlo simulations on 100 realizations of a non - standard inflationary model , with varying levels of non - gaussianity .",
    "comments and directions for further research are collected in the final section ( [ sect : disc ] ) .",
    "the details of the empirical process approach to detect non - gaussianity in the cmb were given in @xcite . in short ,",
    "the method consists of a family of tests which focus on the total distribution of @xmath0 and checks for dependencies between @xmath17 @xmath9-rows .",
    "the first step is to transform the spherical harmonic coefficients into variables @xmath18 which have an approximate uniform distribution between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , given that the @xmath0 were initially gaussian distributed .",
    "this is done using the smirnov transformation , defined as @xmath21where @xmath22 is the cumulative distribution function of a @xmath23 with @xmath24 degrees of freedom and @xmath25 are the power spectrum coefficients estimated from the data . the error introduced by using estimated @xmath25 instead of the real underlying @xmath26 is dealt with using a bias - subtraction , as described in @xcite .",
    "+ then the joint empirical distribution function for row @xmath9 is formed , @xmath27 where @xmath28 determines the spacing between the rows for which the dependencies are tested and @xmath29 denotes the difference in @xmath30 for row @xmath31 . the parameters @xmath32 run over the interval @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "the empirical process is expressed using the centered and rescaled @xmath34 given as @xmath35 the intuition behind this procedure is as follows : if the @xmath0s are gaussian , @xmath36 converges to a well - defined limiting process , whose distribution can be readily tabulated . on the other hand ,",
    "for non - gaussian @xmath0s @xmath37 and thereby @xmath36 will take ` high ' values over some parts of @xmath38-space .",
    "thus , the analysis of some appropriate functional of @xmath36 can be used to detect non - gaussianity . to combine the information over all multipoles into one statistic",
    ", we define @xmath39}\\widehat{g}_{\\ell, ... ,\\ell+\\delta _ { \\ell , k-1}}(\\alpha _ { 1}, ... ,\\alpha _ { k})\\text { , } \\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the highest multipole where the data is signal dominated .",
    "the method can then be summarized as follows : the distribution of @xmath41 is found using monte - carlo simulations of gaussian distributed @xmath0 .",
    "then , for a given observed set of @xmath0 , the value @xmath42 is found and compared to the distribution obtained from monte - carlo .",
    "the consistency of the data with a gaussian distribution can then be estimated to any suitable @xmath43-level .",
    "the process described in the previous section can be improved in several ways .",
    "one important thing to notice is that if the @xmath0 are non - gaussian distributed , their joint distribution will change under a rotation of the sky , and therefore it will not be invariant with respect to the choice of coordinate system . in spherical harmonic space , the rotation of the sky with the euler angles @xmath44 can be written as , @xmath45 where the rotation matrices @xmath46 are described in appendix ( [ app : rot ] ) .",
    "this new sets of @xmath0 will yield a different ( although not independent ) value of @xmath47 ; averaging the @xmath47 obtained from the empirical process over several rotations may thus increase the probability for detecting non - gaussianity in the data . in table [",
    "tab : arot ] , we indeed prove that this effect is noticeable , considering a non - gaussian inflationary model with @xmath48 . to obtain this data , we used 100 gaussian monte - carlo simulations to find the distribution of @xmath47 .",
    "then we used 100 realizations of the non - gaussian model and for each realization we averaged the @xmath47 value obtained over 45 rotation in the @xmath49-direction .",
    "the results are shown using the process to test gaussianity and dependency between 1 , 2 and 3 @xmath9-rows .",
    "we define the @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 detection levels as the @xmath47 values over which we had @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 of the hits in the gaussian simulations respectively . +    .inflationary model , @xmath48 , test a [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in @xcite we argued that the empirical process method enjoyed a number of advantages over existing methods , such as being completely model independent , allowing for a rigorous statistical analysis , detecting the location of non - gaussianity in harmonic space , being easily amendable to extensions and generalizations . in this paper the potentials of this approach are further investigated .",
    "three further classes of tests in the same spirit as in the previous paper are proposed .",
    "changes of coordinates are implemented to make the procedure rotationally invariant and more powerful against non - gaussian alternatives .",
    "we have also considered experimentally meaningful situations such as the presence of gaps and noise .",
    "finally , we have tested the power of these procedures against physically reasonable models such as those expected by non - standard inflation ; we show that for the model considered , significant detections of non - gaussianities are achieved for non linear coupling parameters down to about 100 .",
    "overall we believe that empirical process methods emerge as valuable tools for further studies on the non - gaussianity of the cmb .",
