    "a crucial step in the calculation of the amplitudes for hard - scattering hadronic processes is the separation of the effects of the strong interactions into short - distance and long - distance contributions .",
    "the short - distance contributions are , by virtue of asymptotic freedom in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , perturbatively calculable , while the long - distance contributions are parametrized in terms of inherently nonperturbative quantities .",
    "these separations are usually embodied in factorization theorems for the processes . in the case of hard - scattering processes that involve heavy - quarkonium states",
    ", it has been proposed that the effective theory nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) could be used to describe the separation of perturbative effects that produce a heavy - quark pair from the nonperturbative effects that bring about the evolution of the heavy - quark pair into the quarkonium bound state @xcite .",
    "recently , progress has been made in understanding factorization issues in inclusive heavy - quarkonium production processes @xcite .",

    "measurements of the cross sections for double - charmonium production by the belle @xcite and babar @xcite collaborations have , in several instances , disagreed with theoretical predictions @xcite and have led to a re - examination of the bases for those predictions .",
    "the exclusive decays of @xmath1 mesons into a light meson plus a charmonium state are also of interest , partly because they could provide new constraints on the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix and enhance our understanding of the origins of cp violation . however , the nonperturbative effects of the strong interactions are significant in such processes and must be taken into account in order to make reliable qcd - based calculations of the process rates .",
    "factorization theorems for these processes would provide a first - principles framework within which to take into account the strong - interaction effects . in the case of exclusive decays of @xmath1 mesons into a light meson plus a charmonium state , several factorization theorems have been proposed @xcite .    in this paper , we present proofs , valid to all orders in qcd perturbation theory , of factorization theorems for the exclusive quarkonium - production processes mentioned above , giving details of the proofs that were summarized in ref .",

    "one could , in principle , deal with the low - virtuality contributions by devising a suitable subtraction scheme for the contributions that would appear order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "that would be a formidable task , as one would need to ensure that all such contributions are accounted for in an arbitrarily complicated feynman diagram , with no double counting of contributions .",

    "it is unphysical since , in a meson , confinement cuts off gluon energies at values of order @xmath13 .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to establish factorization in the on - shell case in order to guarantee the consistency of perturbative calculations of the hard part , which are usually carried out in the context of on - shell amplitudes . because the logarithmically enhanced contributions in the presence of a cutoff of order @xmath13 are a subset of the logarithmically enhanced contributions in the case of on - shell external lines , the factorization argument that we will present also applies in the simpler case of a model with a cutoff . as we will see , the methods that we use to prove factorization apply to models in which the external particles are off their mass shells , provided that the models maintain gauge invariance . for example , one could model the @xmath1 meson as an elementary , color - singlet pseudoscalar that produces the constituent quark and antiquark off their mass shells through a pointlike pseudoscalar - interaction vertex that is proportional to @xmath135 .      in describing the regions of loop momenta that yield contributions that are leading in powers of the large scale @xmath75",

    "we treat the semihard region as part of the hard region , and we include lines carrying semihard momenta in the hard subdiagram that we will describe below .",
    "the `` glauber '' region is also leading in power counting @xcite . in this region , @xmath171 . in processes with two incoming hadrons , such as drell - yan lepton - pair production",
    ", pinch singularities can develop in the glauber region for the @xmath172 and @xmath173 contours of integration on a diagram - by - diagram basis @xcite .",
    "the pinches arise when a gluon connects a spectator parton in one initial - state hadron with a spectator parton in the other initial - state hadron .",
    "( here , in contrast with the terminology that is used to discuss exclusive @xmath1-meson decays , `` spectator parton '' means a parton that does not participate in the hard - scattering process . )",
    "the pinches appear because the momentum of a gluon that attaches to a spectator - parton line must route through the hadron wave function and the active - parton line from that hadron to the hard process .",
    "if the gluon s momentum in the active - parton line is in the same direction as the momentum of the active parton , then , in the spectator - parton line , it is in the direction opposite to the momentum of the spectator parton .",
    "consequently , there is a pinch in the light - cone variable that is conjugate to the direction of the momentum of the hadron . in contrast , in exclusive processes , all of the partons in a hadron are connected in the lowest - order process , either through the hard subprocess or , possibly through a soft gluon in the case of @xmath1-meson decays .",
    "( see the discussion of the endpoint region above . )",
    "thus , if an additional gluon carrying soft momentum attaches to a parton , one can always route that momentum through a leading - order connection to the hard part , avoiding routings through other partons in the hadron that could produce a pinch .",
    "because of this , the @xmath172 and @xmath173 contours of integration are not pinched in the glauber region in exclusive processes , and it is possible to deform them out of the glauber region on a diagram - by - diagram basis .",
    "therefore , we ignore the glauber region in the remainder of our discussion .      in the case of a quarkonium , there are `` threshold enhancements '' that are associated with the exchange of a gluon between the quark and the antiquark .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for examples . ) in the quarkonium rest frame , the enhancement occurs when the exchanged gluon has momentum components @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "the enhancement produces a power infrared divergence that is cut off by the relative momentum of the quark and antiquark @xmath176 .",
    "the divergence is proportional to @xmath177 .",
    "now let us consider the momentum of the exchanged gluon in the @xmath0 cm frame in the case of @xmath0 annihilation and in the @xmath1-meson rest frame in the case of @xmath1-meson decays . in these frames",

    "therefore , the exchanged gluons associated with threshold enhancement have @xmath138 or @xmath139 momentum , and , in our analysis , we do not distinguish them from other gluons with @xmath138 or @xmath139 momentum . because the threshold enhancements involve the gluons and heavy quarks in a single quarkonium , in each feynman diagram they are _ a priori _ compatible with the factorized forms .",
    "therefore , it will not be necessary to manipulate the threshold contributions or to identify them by considering the limit @xmath180 .",
    "next we identify the configurations of momentum types that can yield leading contributions in the feynman diagrams . by `` leading '' , we mean contributions that are not suppressed as powers of ratios of momentum components .",
    "we follow the analysis presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . here , and throughout this paper , we work in the feynman gauge .",
    "we start with a basic diagram that is just the amplitude of lowest order that involves the external quark and antiquark from each meson .",
    "then we add gluons , one at a time , determining for each gluon the momentum types that produce leading contributions .",
    "the added gluons can contain quark , gluon , and ghost vacuum - polarization loops .    because there are many redundant ways to obtain a given momentum configuration in a diagram ,",

    "it follows that , for gluons in the singular regions , our convention that an allowed attachment of a gluon can not change the essential nature of the momentum of the line to which it attaches has the following meaning : the attaching gluon can not have an energy that is greater by an infinite factor than the energy of the line to which it attaches .    the rules in sec .",

    "@xcite did not consider the possibility that on - shell lines could emit gluons with arbitrarily small momenta .",
    "such a possibility arises , for example , when one computes short - distance coefficients by making use of on - shell matching conditions . in the present paper",
    ", we have shown that factorization still holds when one takes into account this possibility .",
    "we have also given more refined estimates of the violations of factorization than were given in ref .",
    "@xcite , by considering the dependence of such violations on the velocity @xmath7 of the heavy quark or antiquark in the quarkonium rest frame .",
    "we note that , although our proofs are demonstrated in models in which external lines are taken to be on the mass shell , the methods of these proofs would apply to off - shell models as well , provided that the models maintain gauge invariance .    in the proofs of factorization",
    ", our general strategy has been to identify soft singularities , collinear singularities , and would - be collinear singularities that appear in the limit of zero heavy - quark mass . by demonstrating the factorization of these singularities and would - be singularities , we are able to argue that the associated logarithmic enhancements also factorize .",
    "once the logarithmic enhancements have been removed , the remainder of the production amplitude can depend only on the hard scale and , hence , is perturbatively calculable .    in demonstrating the factorization of singularities and would - be singularities , we have made use of standard techniques ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , but we have had to augment them in order to deal with the situation in which low - energy collinear gluons attach to soft gluons . for this purpose , we made use of the approach developed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of the production of light mesons in @xmath0 annihilation .",

    "@xcite , the factorized form was written in terms of the quarkonium light - cone distribution , rather than in terms of nrqcd matrix elements . ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was conjectured that the violations of factorization should vanish in the limit @xmath83 , but a detailed analysis of the scaling of the violations of factorization with @xmath11 , @xmath82 , and @xmath7 was not given .",
    "we find , generally , that the violations of factorization are suppressed by a factor @xmath461 for each charmonium @xmath118 in an @xmath3-wave state and by a factor @xmath462 for each charmonium @xmath118 in a higher orbital - angular - momentum state , where @xmath8 is the cm energy in @xmath0 annihilation and @xmath463 in @xmath1-meson decays . because the violations of factorization are proportional to @xmath7 , they vanish ( up to corrections that are proportional to @xmath291 ) if one works to order @xmath464 in one charmonium .",
    "this statement has been confirmed in calculations at order @xmath317 ( refs .",
    ".    in the case of @xmath1-meson decays , the error - suppression factors for @xmath3-wave and @xmath72-wave charmonia are @xmath465 and @xmath466 , respectively . these are not particularly small , and the violations of factorization may well be comparable to the factorized contributions .",
    "in the case of @xmath0 annihilation , the error - suppression factors are smaller by a factor @xmath467 than in the case of @xmath1-meson decays .",
    "furthermore , there is a suppression factor for each quarkonium in the process .",
    "hence , in the case of @xmath0 annihilation , the errors are likely to be sufficiently small that the factorization formula would be useful .",
    "since the coefficients of the suppression factors are nonperturbative quantities , their sizes must be determined , at present , through phenomenological studies .    in special cases ,",
    "the relative sizes of the violations of factorization may be enhanced because of quantum - number considerations .",
    "for example , in @xmath1-meson decays , the production of @xmath468 or @xmath469 charmonia through factorized contributions is not allowed in order @xmath312 .",
    "the production of @xmath468 or @xmath469 charmonia through factorization - violating contributions _ does _ occur in order @xmath312 .",
    "therefore , in these cases , the violations of factorization are enhanced by a factor @xmath470 relative to the factorized contributions .",
    "finally , we mention that we could have written the collinear functions @xmath294 that are associated with each quarkonium in terms of light - cone distributions instead of nrqcd matrix elements . as we have explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : factorization - corrections ] , such an approach yields a hard - scattering function @xmath211 that is manifestly free of soft divergences .",
    "in contrast , in the factorized expressions involving nrqcd matrix elements that we have presented , power - suppressed soft divergences _ do _ appear in @xmath211 and must be discarded . in the case of double - charmonium production , these soft divergences are suppressed as @xmath323 , while the corrections to the light - cone - distribution factorization formula are suppressed only as @xmath324 .",
    "therefore , in the case of double - charmonium production , the factorized expression involving nrqcd matrix elements that we have presented is more accurate than a factorized expression involving light - cone distributions for the quarkonia .",
