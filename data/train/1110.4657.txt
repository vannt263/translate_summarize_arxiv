    "a great number of questions in machine learning , computer game intelligence , control theory , and numerous other applications involve the design of algorithms for decision - making by an agent under a specified set of circumstances . in the most general",
    "setting , the problem can be described mathematically in terms of the state and action pairs as follows .",
    "a state - action pair is an ordered pair of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the set of actions ( or moves , in case the agent is playing a game , for instance ) that the agent is capable of taking when it is in the state ( or , in case of a game , a state might be sometimes referred to as a position ) @xmath2 . due to randomness , hidden features , lack of memory , limitation of the sensor capabilities etc",
    ", the state may be only partially observable by the agent .",
    "mathematically this means that there is a function @xmath3 ( as a matter of fact , a random variable with respect the unknown probability space structure on the set @xmath4 ) where @xmath4 is the set of all states which could be either finite or infinite while @xmath5 is the set ( usually finite due to memory limitations ) of observations having the property that whenever @xmath6 ( i.e. whenever the agent can not distinguish states @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) then the corresponding state action pairs @xmath9 and @xmath10 are such that @xmath11 ( i.e. the agent knows which actions it can possibly take based only on the observation it makes ) . the general problem of reinforcement learning is to decide which action is best suited given the agent s knowledge ( that is the observation that the agent has made as well as the agent s past experience ) . in computational settings  suitability \" is naturally described in terms of a numerical reward value . in the probability theoretic sense the agent aims to maximize the expected reward ( the expected reward considered as a random variable on the enormous and unknown conditional probability space of states given a specific observation and an action taken ) .",
    "most common models such as pomdps ( partially observable markov decision processes ) assume that the next state and the corresponding numerical rewards depend stochastically only on the current observation and action . in a number of situations the immediate rewards after executing a single action are unknown . the so - called  model free \" reinforcement learning methods , such as monte carlo techniques ( i.e. algorithms based on repeated random sampling )",
    "are exploited to tackle problems of this type . in such algorithms a large number of _ rollouts _",
    "( i.e. simulations or self - plays ) are made and actions are assigned numerical payoffs that get updated dynamically ( i.e at every simulation of an algorithm ) . while the simulated self - plays started with a specific chosen action ,",
    "say @xmath12 , are entirely random , the action @xmath12 itself is chosen with respect to a dynamically updated probability distribution which ensures the exploration versus exploitation balance : the technique known as ucb ( upper confidence bounds ) .",
    "it may be worth emphasizing that the ucb methodology is based on a solid mathematical foundation ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "a combination of ucb with monte carlo sampling lead to tremendous break through in computer go performance level ( see @xcite and @xcite , for instance ) and much research is currently undergoing to widen the applicability of the method . some of the particularly challenging and interesting directions involve decision making in the environments ( or games ) involving randomness , hidden information and uncertainty or in  continuous \" environments where appropriate similarities on the set of states must be constructed due to runtime and memory limitations and also action evaluation polices must be enhanced to cope with drastic changes in the payoffs as well as an enormous combinatorial explosion in the branching factor of the decision tree . in recent years a number of heuristic approaches have been proposed based on the existing probabilistic planning methodology . despite some of these newly developed methods have already achieved surprisingly powerful performance levels : see @xcite and @xcite , the authors believe there is still room for drastic improvement based on the rigorous mathematical theory originated from classical population genetics ( @xcite ) and later adopted in traditional evolutionary computation theory ( @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) . theorems of this type are known as geiringer - like results and they address the limiting  frequency of occurrence \" of various sets of  genes \" as recombination is repeatedly applied over time .",
    "the main objective of the current work is to establish a rather general and powerful version of a geiringer - like theorem with ",
    "non - homologous \" recombination operators in the setting of monte carlo sampling .",
    "this theorem leads to simple dynamic algorithms that exploit the intrinsic similarity within the space of observations to increase exponentially the size of the already existing sample of rollouts yielding significantly more informative action - evaluation at very little or even no additional computational cost at all .",
    "the details of how this is done will be described in sections  [ equivsimsect ] and [ settingsect ] .",
    "due to space limitations , the actual algorithms will appear in sequel papers .",
    "as a matter of fact , we believe the interested readers may actually design such algorithms on their own after studying sections  [ equivsimsect ] and [ settingsect ] .",
    "due to the interdisciplinary nature of this work the authors did their best to make the paper accessible on various levels to a potentially wide audience having diverse backgrounds and research interests ranging from practical software engineering to applied mathematics , theoretical computer science and high - level algorithm design based on solid mathematical foundation .",
    "the next section ( section  [ equivsimsect ] ) is essential for understanding the main idea of the paper . it provides the notation and sets up a rigorous mathematical framework , while the informal comments motivating the various notions introduced , assist the reader s comprehension .",
    "section  [ settingsect ] contains all the necessary definitions and concepts required to state and to explain the results of the article .",
    "it ends with the statement of geiringer - like theorem aimed at applications to decision making in the environments with randomness and incomplete information where no immediate rewards are available .",
    "this is the central aim of the paper .",
    "a reader who is only after a calculus level understanding with the aim of developing applications within an appropriate area of software engineering may be satisfied reading section  [ settingsect ] and finishing their study at this point .",
    "section  [ generalthmsect ] is devoted to establishing and deriving the main results of the article in a mathematically rigorous fashion .",
    "clearly this is fundamentally important for understanding where these results come from and how one may modify them as needed .",
    "we strongly encourage all the interested readers to attempt understanding the entire section  [ generalthmsect ] .",
    "subsection  [ stagesubsect ] does require familiarity with elementary group theory .",
    "a number of textbooks on this subject are available ( see , for instance , @xcite ) but all of them contain way more material than necessary to understand our work . to get the minimal necessary understanding , the reader is invited to look at the previous papers on finite population geiringer theorems of the first two authors : @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , section  [ furthstrengthsect ] is included only for the sake of strengthening the general finite - population geiringer theorem to emphasize its validity for nonhomogenious time markov chains , namely theorem  [ geiringerextthm ] .",
    "example  [ intuitiveinterpex ] explains why this is of interest for the algorithm development .",
    "the material in section  [ furthstrengthsect ] is entirely independent of the rest of the paper .",
    "one could read it either at the beginning or at the end .",
    "the authors suspect this theory is known in modern math , but the literature emphasizing theorems  [ markovnonmarkovsubtleextcor ] and [ markovnonmarkovsubtleextcorext ] is virtually impossible to locate .",
    "moreover , mathematics behind these theorems is classical , general , simple and elegant . while section  [ furthstrengthsect ] is probably not of any interest to software engineers ( theorem  [ geiringerextthm ] may be thought to strengthen the justification of the main ideas ) , more mathematically inclined audience will find it enjoyable and easy to read",
    "let @xmath4 denote the set of states ( enormous but finite in this framework ) .",
    "formally each state @xmath13 is an ordered pair @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the set of actions an agent can possibly take when in the state @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 be an equivalence relation on @xmath4 .",
    "without loss of generality we will denote every equivalence class by an integer @xmath18 so that each element of @xmath4 as an ordered pair @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 with @xmath22 being some finite alphabet . with this notation @xmath23 iff @xmath24 . intuitively , @xmath4 is the set of states and @xmath17 is the similarity relation on the states .",
    "for example in a card game if the 2 states corresponding to the same player have cards of roughly equivalent value ( for that specific game ) and their opponent s cards are unknown ( and there might be some more hidden and random effects ) then the 2 states will be considered equivalent under @xmath17 .",
    "we will also require that for two equivalent states @xmath25 and @xmath26 under @xmath17 there are bijections @xmath27 and @xmath28 . for the time being , these bijections should be obvious from the representation of the environment ( and actions ) and reflect the similarity between these actions .",
    "[ formalreqcommsrem ] in theory we want functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 to be bijections and inverses of one another for the theoretical model to be perfectly rigorous , but in practice there should probably be no strict requirement on that .",
    "in fact , we believe that in practice one may even want to relax the assumption on @xmath17 to be an equivalence relation .    as described in sections  [ introsect ] and [ overviewsect ] , the most challenging question when applying an mct type of an algorithm to deal with randomness and incomplete information or simply with a large branching factor of the game tree is to evaluate the actions under consideration making the most out of the sample of independent rollouts .",
    "quite surprisingly , very powerful programs have already been developed and tested in practice against human players ( see @xcite ) , however the action - evaluation algorithms used in these software are purely heuristic and no theoretical foundation is presented to explain their success .",
    "in fact , most of these methods use some kind of a voting mechanism to deal with rather weak classifiers . in the next section",
    "we will set up the stage to state the main result of this paper which motivates new algorithms for evaluating actions ( or moves ) at the chance nodes and hopefully will provide some understanding for the success of the already existing techniques in the future research .",
    "[ treerootedbychancenode ] suppose we are given a chance node @xmath31 and a sequence @xmath32 of actions in @xmath15 ( it is possible that @xmath33 for @xmath34 ) .",
    "we may then call @xmath16 a _ root state _ , or a _ state in question _ , the sequence @xmath32 , the _ sequence of moves ( actions ) under evaluation _ and the set of moves @xmath35 for some @xmath36 with @xmath37 , the set of actions ( or moves ) under evaluation .    [ rolloutdefn ] a _ rollout _ with respect to the state in question @xmath31 and an action @xmath38 is a sequence of states following the action @xmath12 and ending with a terminal label @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an arbitrary set of labels represents a terminal state that we can assign a numerical value to via a function @xmath41 .",
    "the reason we introduce the set @xmath40 of formal labels as opposed to requiring that each terminal label is a rational number straight away , is to avoid confusion in the upcoming definitions ] , which looks as @xmath42 . for technical reasons which will become obvious later we will also require that @xmath43 for @xmath34 ( it is possible and common to have @xmath44 though ) . we will say that the total number of states in a rollout ( which is @xmath45 in the notation of this definition ) is the _ height _ of the rollout .    [ rolloutdefrem ] notice that in definition  [ rolloutdefn ] we included only the initial move @xmath12 made at the state in question ( see definition  [ treerootedbychancenode ] ) which is the move under evaluation ( see definition  [ treerootedbychancenode ] ) .",
    "the moves between the intermediate states are chosen randomly and are not evaluated so that there is no reason to consider them .",
    "[ crossoverconvrepresrem ] in subsection  [ equivsimsect ] we have introduced a convenient notation for states to emphasize their respective equivalence classes . with such notation a typical rollout would appear as a sequence @xmath46 with @xmath47 while @xmath48 . according to the requirement in definition  [ rolloutdefn ] , @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "a single rollout provides rather little information about an action particularly due to the combinatorial explosion in the branching factor of possible moves of the player and the opponents .",
    "normally a large , yet comparable with total resource limitations , number of rollouts is thrown to evaluate the actions at various positions . the challenging question which the current work addresses is how one can take full advantage of the parallel sequence of rollouts .",
    "since the main idea is motivated by geiringer theorem which is originated from population genetics ( @xcite ) and later has also been involved in evolutionary computation theory ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) we shall exploit the terminology of the evolutionary computation community here .",

    "a homologous population is one where equivalent states can not appear at different  heights \" .",
    "[ popofrolloutsrem ] each rollout @xmath59 in definition  [ popofrolloutsdefn ] is started with the corresponding move @xmath60 of the sequence of moves under evaluation ( see definition  [ treerootedbychancenode ] ) .",
    "it is clear that if one were to permute the rollouts without changing the actual sequences of states the corresponding populations should provide identical values for the corresponding actions under evaluation .",
    "in fact , most authors in evolutionary computation theory ( see @xcite , for instance ) do assume that such populations are equivalent and deal with the corresponding equivalence classes of multisets corresponding to the individuals ( these are sequences of rollouts ) . nonetheless , when dealing with finite - population geiringer - like theorems it is convenient for technical reasons which will become clear when the proof is presented ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) to assume the _ ordered multiset model _",
    "i.e. the populations are considered formally _",
    "distinct _ when the individuals are permuted",
    ". incidentally , ordered multiset models are useful for other types of theoretical analysis in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "[ poprolloutex ] a typical population with the convention as in remark  [ popofrolloutsrem ] might look as below .",
    "@xmath61 the height of the first rollout in the population pictured above would then be @xmath62 since it contains @xmath62 states .",
    "the reader can easily see that the heights of the rollouts in this population read from top to bottom are @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath62 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath63 respectively . clearly , the total number of states within the population is the sum of the heights of all the rollouts in the population .",
    "in fact , this very simple observation is rather valuable when establishing the main result of the current article as will become clear in subsection  [ specificthmderivationsubsect ] of section  [ generalthmsect ] .",
    "the main idea is that the random actions taken at the equivalent states should be interchangeable since they are chosen somehow at random during the simulation stage of the mct algorithm . in the language of evolutionary computing , such a swap of moves is called a crossover . due to randomness or incomplete information ( together with the equivalence relation which can be defined using the expert knowledge of a specific game being analyzed ) in order to obtain the most out of a sample ( population in our language ) of the parallel rollouts it is desirable to explore all possible populations obtained by making various swaps of the corresponding rollouts at the equivalent positions .",
    "computationally this task seems expensive if one were to run the type of genetic programming described precisely below , yet , it turns out that we can predict exactly what the limiting outcome of this  mixing procedure \" would be . and in section  [ generalthmsect ] .",
