    "ever since the direct observation of phase separations of unequal two - component @xmath0 cold atoms in experiments@xcite , the topic of polarized fermi gases has gained enormous interest from theoreticians interests in the past few years@xcite .",
    "such an imbalanced and attractively interacting fermionic system makes it possible to study in the laboratory several exotic fermionic pairing mechanisms , including sarma@xcite or breached pair@xcite state and fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state@xcite with finite pairing momentum .",
    "however , it is hard for fflo state to be experimentally observed in three - dimensional ( 3d ) free space .",
    "it was proved to survive in a very small region in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) side of feshbach resonance and totally vanish in the bec side , both for a homogeneous fermi gas@xcite and a trapped one@xcite .",
    "recently more and more attention has been paid to one - dimensional ( 1d)@xcite and two - dimensional ( 2d)@xcite systems .",
    "it has been pointed out that for these reduced dimensions , the polarization window of fflo state is generally broadened compared to 3d free space .    despite many previous studies on imbalanced fermions in pure 1d , 2d and 3d systems ,",
    "the crossover regimes between different dimensions are poorly understood and still need further investigations , such as quasi-1d and quasi-2d systems .",
    "experimentally , these geometries can be achieved by exposing magnetic or optical traps or optical lattices along selective directions . among all trapping confinements ,",
    "optical lattices are the most complicated because of the band structures .",
    "a very interesting and important question then immediately arises : how would the dimension and band structure affect the fermionic superfluidity , especially the exotic fflo state",
    "? there have been several works related to this subject .",
    "for example , the fflo state was studied in pure 1d , 2d and 3d optical latices and shown to be enhanced as a result of the van hove singularities@xcite ; it was also previously found with evident proportions in an array of 1d tubes produced by 2d optical lattices@xcite and in two - lag ladders@xcite . in the presence of optical lattices , however , all these studies have adopted the fermi - hubbard model based on the tight - binding approximation ( tba ) , which is generally believed to be valid for deep lattices and not very strong interactions such that the lowest band model is good enough to describe the system . on the other hand , a different approach based on",
    "the exact lattice spectrum@xcite shows that tba does not necessarily produce the correct results because of the multiband effects and deviations of the lowest band structures , even for optical lattices with considerable band gap .",
    "in this work we are going to use the exact spectrum to investigate the zero temperature phase diagrams for imbalanced fermions in asymmetric optical lattices , tuned by lattice potential depths and atomic densities .",
    "this work studies the fflo state in optical lattices with arbitrary potential depths .",
    "the results obtained reveal the fundamental effects of the dimension and the effective coupling to the strength of fermionic superfluidities , including fflo state , and thus give an answer to the question previously proposed .",
    "therefore our results can serve as a guideline for cold fermions experiments and might contribute to finally observing the novel fflo - type pairing state .",
    "in this work we consider optical lattices applied in selective directions and take into account the couplings between different reciprocal lattice vectors , which recently were proved to be necessary for optical lattices@xcite .",
    "the possibility of fflo pairing is studied in the remanent free direction(s ) .",
    "we find that by increasing the lattice depths , fflo gradually diminishes at low atomic densities as a result of the enhanced effective coupling , but revives at intermediate densities where the system undergoes a dimensional crossover .",
    "compared with the density - driven bcs - bec crossover initially studied in exciton superconductors@xcite and then applied to attractive fermi gases@xcite , the density - driven crossover from weak to strong coupling limits mentioned here is unique to optical lattices and may induce even more significant effects to the system in the sense that it changes the effective dimension .",
    "in contrast , the strength of unpolarized bcs superfluidity is enhanced at low atomic densities but frustrated at intermediate ones because of the discontinuity of the energy spectrum .",
    "all these results can be understood when investigating the density of state ( dos ) , which has an intimate and sensitive dependence on the lattice potential and the atomic density .",
    "finally , in the presence of the external harmonic trap , we use local density approximation ( lda ) to investigate the evolution of phase profiles merely tuned by the potential depths of asymmetric optical lattices .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we outline our general model and method . in sec .",
    "[ phasediag ] we give the phase diagrams for density - imbalanced two - component fermions in several asymmetric optical lattices , including quasi-1d and quasi-2d geometries .",
    "we mainly focus on quasi-1d case , which could be achieved by applying optical lattices to either 3d or effective 2d space .",
    "the effect of external harmonic confinement is studied in sec .",
    "[ h - trap ] .",
    "we summarize our results in the last section .",
    "we consider a two - component fermi gas with contact interactions by the following hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 is composed by the kinetic energy and optical lattice potential if applied ; @xmath3 is the bare contact interaction described by s - wave scattering length @xmath4 in 3d as @xmath5 ; and by the binding energy @xmath6 in effective 2d as @xmath7 .",
    "the renormalization of @xmath3 here is to eliminate the unphysical divergence due to the high - momentum contribution in a fermi gas .    to illustrate our scheme , we take a quasi-1d fermi gas confined by two orthogonal optical lattices in x and y directions .",
    "for example , @xmath8 $ ] , here @xmath9 is the lattice constant and @xmath10 the potential depth . by mean - field treatment",
    ", first we expand each field operator in terms of eigen - wavefunctions of @xmath11 , @xmath12 with @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the eigen - energy ; @xmath15 indicates the band index ; @xmath16 lies in the first brillouin zone ( @xmath17 ) while @xmath18 has no constraint ; @xmath19 is the reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "the bloch wave functions and eigen - energies can be obtained from the decoupled schrdinger equation in each ( x or y ) direction @xmath20\\delta_{gg ' } -\\frac{v_0}{4}\\sum_i\\delta_{g\\pm\\frac{2\\pi}{a},g'}\\big\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{90pt } \\times a_{nk}(g')=\\epsilon_{nk}a_{nk}(g),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the eigenvectors satisfy @xmath21 and @xmath22 . for convenience we rescale the energy and momentum respectively in units of the recoil energy @xmath23 and lattice reciprocal vector @xmath24 .",
    "then the lattice potential and atomic density are expressed by two dimensionless parameters : @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    toward the fflo state ,",
    "we employ the simplest single plane wave ansatz to the free direction as @xmath27 . for the lattice part , however , we focus on the most probable pairing mechanism , i.e. , pairing with two opposite crystal momenta within the same band .",
    "the pairing between different bands@xcite is to be neglected here in our work .",
    "one important reason is that we are dealing with the weak coupling regime and therefore the interaction is not large enough to overcome the energy differences and form inter - band pairs .    by employing two set of pairing fields in terms of bloch state indices @xmath28 and",
    "reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath29 , @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 all lying in x - y plane , the hamiltonian is then reduced to @xmath33 where the quasi - particle spectrum reads @xmath34 with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and chemical potentials @xmath37 , @xmath38 .    from the saddle - point equations @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    ", we obtain the gap , current and density equations as @xmath42    therefore the consideration of couplings between different @xmath43 directly results in the coupled gap equations ( [ gap - eq ] ) . to get solutions with great precision one must take into account as many non - zero @xmath43 as possible , and we find that the smaller ones dominate over the larger ones , especially in free space one has @xmath44 .",
    "this could be understood when examining the properties of @xmath45 , which is closely related to the pairing amplitude @xmath46 for each @xmath43 , for a simple 1d optical lattice . at very high energy levels ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 close to those in free space , so the contributions mainly come from several low bands .",
    "near the bottom of the lowest band , the perturbation theory justified for shallow lattices ( @xmath49 ) gives @xmath50 and zero for other high - order ones ; whereas the tba for deep lattices ( @xmath51 ) gives a smooth gaussian distribution as @xmath52 .",
    "for intermediate @xmath53 it is numerically verified that smaller @xmath54 always lead to predominantly larger @xmath45 and therefore contribute the most to the summations in eq.([delt ] ) and ( [ gap - eq ] ) .    in view of the properties of non - zero @xmath55pairing in this case , besides @xmath56 we consider the other four smallest nonzero ones : @xmath57 . because of the equivalence of x and y directions , all these non - zero @xmath43 share the same pairing amplitude @xmath58 .",
    "therefore we get @xmath59 , and the coupled gap equations are in terms of @xmath60 and @xmath58 .",
    "next we utilize the this model to study the phase diagrams of imbalanced fermions , either in terms of chemical potentials @xmath61 or in terms of particle densities @xmath62 . in the @xmath63 phase diagram ,",
    "the phase boundaries separating the fully paired bcs state , fflo state , and normal ( n ) state are determined as follows .",
    "we solve eq.([gap - eq ] ) for bcs state at given @xmath64 and obtain the minimum excitation energy @xmath65 as the first step .",
    "then the bcs - normal ( bcs - n ) phase boundary ( @xmath66 ) is determined from the following equation @xmath67 note that this equation has a solution for @xmath68 only when @xmath69 .",
    "otherwise the stable magnetized superfluid ( @xmath70 ) phase would interpolate between bcs and normal together with two continuous phase boundaries in between . near the fflo - n boundary , @xmath71 can be expanded in terms of small pairing amplitudes as @xmath72 where @xmath73 for particular pairing momentum ( @xmath74 ) , the upper limit of @xmath75 for fflo state ( @xmath76 ) is determined by setting @xmath77 , and in this particular case @xmath78 is a @xmath79 matrix . while the fflo - n boundaries ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) are obtained by finding the maximum of @xmath76 as a function of @xmath74 . under mean - field treatment , the bcs - n phase transition is always found to be first - order , while fflo - n is second - order . moreover , as the thermodynamic potentials of fflo and normal states are very close to each other near the bcs - fflo boundary ( @xmath82 ) , which makes @xmath82 very close to @xmath66 , in the following we do not distinguish these two boundaries .",
    "after obtain the @xmath63 phase diagram , we directly convert it to the polarization - density ( @xmath83 ) phase diagram composed of phase separation ( ps ) of bcs and n state , fflo and n state .",
    "for example , the bcs - n phase boundary of the former ( @xmath66 ) corresponds to the ps - n boundary of the latter ( @xmath84 ) ; in other words , @xmath84 is just the polarization of a n state with chemical potentials ( @xmath85 ) , for the reason that the ps with maximum polarization just represents the critical point when bcs state vanishes and n spreads to the whole space .",
    "similarly the fflo - n boundary of the former ( @xmath80 ) corresponds to the same one of the latter ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the phase diagrams of imbalanced two - component fermions including fflo state have been studied previously in free 3d@xcite and 2d@xcite spaces based on mean - field theory , and in a 1d@xcite space using bethe ansatz technique .",
    "remarkably in 1d case fflo exhibits a quite broad polarization window ranging from a rather small value to unity in the weak coupling limit . in this section",
    "we study the quasi-1d and quasi-2d geometries that can be achieved by applying optical lattices in selective directions .",
    "note that there are two ways to generate the quasi-1d system .",
    "one is from the combination of a tight harmonic confinement in one direction and an optical lattice in another , which generate 1d tubes lying in a plane ; the other is from two orthogonal optical lattices , which induce 1d tubes in 2d lattice sites . in the next subsections we illustrate these two cases .",
    "finally we briefly introduce the quasi-2d system generated by a 1d optical lattice .",
    "for realistic simulations , we apply the cutoff momentum well above the fermi momentum @xmath87 , which is defined for an unpolarized normal fermi gas with the same total atoms number as the polarized one studied , to ensure accuracy .",
    "the attractive s - wave interaction is fixed to be well within the weak coupling limit .      for an effective 2d space with the axial freedom of motion frozen by a tight harmonic confinement ,",
    "the renormalized atom - atom interaction is characterized by the two - body binding energy @xmath88@xcite , where @xmath89 is the confinement frequency , @xmath90 is the characteristic confinement length and @xmath91 . in such a 2d system , all phase boundaries could be analytically obtained@xcite except for fflo .",
    "we numerically calculate the fflo - n boundary and verify the previous predictions@xcite in weak coupling limit that two fermi surfaces just touch at the critical point , with a constant pairing momentum amplitude @xmath92 .",
    "the two relevant boundaries are @xmath93     diagram constructed by vacuum , bcs , fflo , partially polarized normal ( ppn ) and fully polarized normal ( fpn ) states .",

    "first , numerical simulations show that the fflo - n boundary @xmath80 , which is the maximum value of @xmath76 at certain non - zero @xmath74 , shows up immediately when @xmath109 , but is less than the bcs - n boundary @xmath66 until @xmath64 up to @xmath110 at point c [ shown in fig .",

    "second , fig .",
    "[ pure2d](b ) shows that the maximum polarization window for fflo state to exist as ground state is less than @xmath111 , even when taking into account the small distinction between @xmath82 and @xmath66 .",
    "third , throughout the range of @xmath64 , there is no stable magnetized superfluid ( @xmath70 ) phase found as that in the strong coupling limit in 3d free space .",
    "one powerful piece of evidence is that the sarma - n boundary ( @xmath112 ) can never exceed the lowest bcs excitation energy ( @xmath113 ) , @xmath114 implying the exclusion of @xmath70 from the ground - state solutions . here",
    "@xmath112 is obtained by solving the gap equations at zero gap amplitudes .",
    "we also use this criterion to judge the existence of @xmath70 in the following calculations for optical lattices .    .",

    "[ q1d_m1 ] .",
    "first we study the low density limit .",
    "it is observed that the minimum density for fflo to exist , @xmath120 , moves to the right ( becomes large ) as lattice potential @xmath53 increases .",
    "we argue that this indicates a much more enhanced coupling of atoms moving in deeper lattices .",

    "optical lattices applied here drive the system to a strongly interacting regime characterized by the enhanced effective binding energies and thus increase @xmath120 .",
    "moreover , in this dilute limit the maximum of critical chemical potential differences @xmath122 is always at @xmath123 ( see fig . [ q1d_m1_hcq](a ) ) , indicating no fflo but only an unstable sarma state ( @xmath124 ) .     as a function of total pairing momenta @xmath125 at several averaged chemical potentials ( @xmath117 ) with lattice potential @xmath126 .",

    "the optical lattice is applied along x direction .",
    "the inner and outer red dashed lines respectively represent the fermi surfaces at the top of the lowest band ( labeled by 0.264 ) and slightly beyond the bottom of a higher band ( 2.73 ) .",
    "the outer line also corresponds to the dashed - dotted curve in ( a).,width=264,height=283 ]    second we observe that as the density @xmath127 or @xmath64 increases , the fflo - n boundary @xmath80 initially goes up but then suddenly drops at certain position , the reason for which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ q1d_m1_hcq ] . as @xmath127 increases , @xmath80 with nonzero pairing momentum @xmath74 starts to exceed @xmath66 which stabilizes fflo states .",
    "meanwhile , the shape of fermi surface distorts from an ellipse to two disconnected lines , implying a crossover from 2d to a quasi-1d geometry and correspondingly @xmath80 has a rapid increase during the crossover .",
    "when @xmath127 increases further , the shape of fermi surface changes again when atoms begin to fill a higher lattice band .",
    "however , this occupation of a higher band exposes a destructive effect on fflo pairing along the free direction .",
    "for example fig .",
    "[ q1d_m1_hcq](a ) shows that the maximum value of @xmath76 for @xmath128 is much less than that for @xmath129 , leading to a sudden drop of @xmath80 as well as @xmath86 in fig .",
    "[ q1d_m1 ] .",

    "optical lattices are applied along an arbitrary direction in 2d space with different depths @xmath131 . in free space",
    "( @xmath132 ) , dos is a constant ( @xmath133).,width=264,height=170 ]    finally we comment that these effects of optical lattices at low and intermediate densities can be well understood from the point of view of density of state ( dos ) , see also fig .",
    "[ dos_q1d ] .",
    "the variations of dos bring two opposite effects to the bcs superfluidity ( sf ) and fflo . at low densities ( @xmath127 ) ,",
    "dos is enhanced by the optical lattices applied and therefore favors sf but disfavors fflo as a result of the strong effective couplings ; at intermediate @xmath127 , dos decreases with @xmath127 which approximately satisfies @xmath134 indicating the evolution to 1d geometry , so this time fflo is favored while sf is suppressed .",
    "when @xmath127 further increases , dos becomes stable at the same level as in 2d free gas when atoms start to fill a higher lattice band .",
    "after this point the quasi-1d geometry fades away and fflo is no longer favored .      the quasi-1d geometry in 3d space is formed by applying optical lattices along two orthogonal directions .",

    "moreover in this region , @xmath136 so actually fflo will not serve as a candidate for ground states .",
    "as @xmath127 continues to increase , the system undergoes a crossover to quasi-1d geometry , and @xmath80 gradually goes up . compared with a negligible fflo polarization window for the 3d free fermi gas , the optical lattice with @xmath126 can broaden the window from as large as @xmath137 at the optimum density @xmath138 . when @xmath127 or @xmath64 is large enough to touch a higher lattice band , @xmath80 and @xmath86 again suffer from a drop behavior as introduced in the previous section .",

    "<S> the zero - temperature phase diagrams of imbalanced two - species fermi gases are investigated in asymmetric optical lattices with arbitrary potential depths , based on the exact spectrum instead of the fermi - hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> we study the effect of lattice potentials and atomic densities to the fully paired bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) state and particularly the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the increasing lattice potential favors bcs at low densities because of the enhanced effective coupling ; whereas fflo is favored at intermediate densities when the system undergoes a dimensional crossover . finally using local density approximation we study the evolution of phase profile in the presence of external harmonic traps by merely tuning the lattice potentials . </S>"
