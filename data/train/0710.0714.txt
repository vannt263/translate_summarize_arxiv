    "the physics of exclusive heavy meson decays has provided very useful testing ground for the precise determination of the fundamental parameters of the standard model(sm ) and the development of a better understanding of the qcd dynamics .",
    "while the experimental tests of exclusive heavy meson decays are much easier than those of inclusive one , the theoretical understanding of exclusive decays is complicated mainly due to the nonperturbative hadronic matrix elements entered in the long distance nonperturbative contributions . since a rigrous field - theoretic formulation with a first principle application of qcd to make a reliable estimates of the nonperturbative hadronic matrix elements has not so far been possible , most of theoretical efforts have been devoted to looking for phenomenological approaches to nonperturbative qcd dynamics .    in our previous light - front quark model(lfqm ) analysis  @xcite based on the qcd - motivated effective hamiltonian , we have analyzed various exlcusive processes such as the semileptonic decays between heavy pseudoscalar mesons  @xcite and the rare @xmath6 decays  @xcite and found a good agreement with the experimental data . along with those exclusive processes , the magnetic dipole(@xmath0 ) transitions @xmath7 from the spin - triplet @xmath8-wave vector(v )",
    "mesons to the spin - singlet @xmath8-wave pseudoscalar(p ) mesons have also been considered as a valuable testing ground to further constrain the phenomenological model of hadrons  @xcite .    in this",
    "talk we thus investigate the magnetic dipole transition among the heavy - flavored mesons such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 using our lfqm  @xcite . since the experimental data available in this heavy - flavored sector are scanty , predictions of a model , if found reliable , can be utilized quite fruitfully .",
    "in addition , we calculate the weak decay constants of heavy pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "a reliable estimate of decay constants is important , as they appear in may processes from which we can extract fundamental quantities in the sm such as cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements . in our lfqm  @xcite , we have implemented the variational principle to qcd - motivated effective lf hamiltonian to enable us to analyze the meson mass spectra and to find optimized model parameters , which are to be used subsequently in the present investigation .",
    "such an approach can better constrain the phenomelogical parameters and establish the extent of applicability of our lfqm to wider ranging hadronic phenomena .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii , we briefly describe the formulation of our lfqm  @xcite and the procedure of fixing the model parameters using the variational principle for the qcd - motivated effective hamiltonian . the decay constants and radiative @xmath1 decay widths for heavy - flavored mesons are then uniquely determined in our model calculation . in sec .",
    "iii , the formulae for the decay constants of pseudoscalar and vector mesons as well as the decay widths for @xmath1 in our lfqm are given . to obtain the @xmath9-dependent transition form factors @xmath10 for @xmath11 transitions",
    ", we use the drell - yan - west @xmath12 frame(i.e .",
    "@xmath13 ) and then analytically continue the spacelike results to the timelike @xmath14 region by changing @xmath15 to @xmath16 in the form factor .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath17 needed for the calculations of the decay widths for @xmath1 can then be determined in the limit as @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath19 . in sec .",
    "iv , we present our numerical results and compare with the available experimental data as well as other theoretical model predictions .",
    "summary and conclusions follow in sec.v .",
    "the key idea in our lfqm  @xcite for mesons is to treat the radial wave function as trial function for the variational principle to the qcd - motivated effective hamiltonian saturating the fock state expansion by the constituent quark and antiquark .",
    "the qcd - motivated hamiltonian for a description of the ground state meson mass spectra is given by [ ham ] h_q|q|^jj_z_nlm&=&|^jj_z_nlm , + & = & [ h_0 + v_q|q]|^jj_z_nlm = m_q|q|^jj_z_nlm , where @xmath20 is the three - momentum of the constituent quark , @xmath21 is the mass of the meson , and @xmath22 is the meson wave function . in this work ,",
    "we use two interaction potentials @xmath23 for the pseudoscalar(@xmath24 ) and vector(@xmath25 ) mesons : ( 1 ) coulomb plus harmonic oscllator(ho ) , and ( 2 ) coulomb plus linear confining potentials .",
    "in addition , the hyperfine interaction , which is essential to distinguish vector from pseudoscalar mesons , is included for both cases , viz . , [ pot ] v_q|q = v_0 + v_hyp = a + v_conf- + ^2v_coul , where @xmath26 for the linear(ho ) potential and @xmath27 for the vector(pseudoscalar ) meson .    the momentum space light - front wave function of the ground state pseudoscalar and vector mesons is given by [ w.f ] ^jj_z_100(x_i,*k*_i,_i ) = r^jj_z__1_2(x_i,*k*_i ) ( x_i,*k*_i ) , where @xmath28 is the radial wave function and @xmath29 is the spin - orbit wave function , which is obtained by the interaction independent melosh transformation from the ordinary equal - time static spin - orbit wave function assigned by the quantum numbers @xmath30 . the model wave function in eq .",
    "( [ w.f ] ) is represented by the lorentz - invariant variables , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the momentum of the meson @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath33 are the momenta and the helicities of constituent quarks , respectively .",
    "the covariant forms of the spin - orbit wave functions for pseudoscalar and vector mesons are given by [ r00_a ] r__1_2 ^ 00 & = & , + r__1_2 ^ 1j_z & = & , + where @xmath37 is the polarization vector of the vector meson  @xcite , @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the invariant meson mass square @xmath39 defined as @xmath40 .",
    "the spin - orbit wave functions satisfy the following relations @xmath41 , for both pseudoscalar and vector mesons . for the radial wave function @xmath42",
    ", we use the same gaussian wave function for both pseudoscalar and vector mesons [ rad ] ( x_i,*k*_i)= ( -k^2/2 ^ 2 ) , where @xmath43 is the variational parameter .",
    "when the longitudinal component @xmath44 is defined by @xmath45 , the jacobian of the variable transformation @xmath46 is given by [ jacob ] = \\ { 1- ^2}. the normalization factor in eq .",
    "( [ rad ] ) is obtained from the following normalization of the total wave function , [ norm ] ^1_0dx |^jj_z_100(x,*k*_i)|^2=1 .",
    "our variational principle to the qcd - motivated effective hamiltonian first evaluate the expectation value of the central hamiltonian @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath48 with a trial function @xmath28 that depends on the variational parameters @xmath43 and varies @xmath43 until @xmath48 is a minimum .",
    "once these model parameters are fixed , then , the mass eigenvalue of each meson is obtained by @xmath49 .",
    "more detailed procedure of determining the model parameters of light and heavy quark sectors can be found in our previous works  @xcite .",
    "our model parameters @xmath50 for the heavy quark sector obtained from the linear and ho potential models are summarized in table  [ t1 ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  [ t5 ] , we present our results for the decay widths and branching ratios together with the available experimental data . the errors in our results for the decay widths and branching ratios come from the uncertainties of the experimental mass values and experimental mass values plus the full widths , respectively .",
    "our results of the branching ratios @xmath51\\%$ ] and @xmath52\\%$ ] obtained from the linear[ho ] parameters are in agreement with the experimental data  @xcite , @xmath53 and @xmath54 within the error bars . for the @xmath55 process , our predictions for the decay width and branching ratio obtained from the linear[ho ] parameters",

    "other model calculations for the @xmath62 radiative @xmath0 decay rates can be found in ref .",

    "[ fig4 ] , we show the dependence of @xmath59 on @xmath60 compared with other theoretical model calculations  @xcite . as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , our prediction for the dependence of @xmath59 on @xmath60 is quite consitent with other theoretical predictions for various @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "in this work , we investigated the weak decay constants and the magnetic dipole @xmath1 decays of heavy - flavored mesons such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 using the lfqm constrained by the variational principle for the qcd - motivated effective hamiltonian .",
    "our model parameters obtained from the variational principle uniquely determine the above nonperturbative quantities .",
    "this approach can establish the extent of applicability of our lfqm to wider ranging hadronic phenomena .",
    "our predictions of mass spectra and decay constants for heavy pseudoscalar and vector mesons are overall in good agreement with the available experimental data as well as other theoretical model calculations .",
    "our numerical results of the decay widths for @xmath64 and @xmath65 fall within the experimental error bars .",
    "our predictions for the branching ratios for the bottomed and bottomed - strange mesons are quite comparible with other theoretical model predictions . for the radiative decay of the bottomonium",
    ", we find that the decay widths @xmath59 is very sensitive to the value of @xmath66 .",
    "this sensitivity for the bottomonium radiative decay may help to determine the mass of @xmath5 experimentally .",
    "since the form fator @xmath10 of vector meson radiative decay @xmath11 presented in this work is precisely analogous to the vector current form factor @xmath67 in weak decay of ground state pseudoscalar meson to ground state vector meson , the ability of our model to describe such decay is therefore relevant to the reliability of the model for the weak decay .",
    "consideration on such exclusive weak decays in our lfqm is underway .",
    "although our previous lfqm  @xcite and this analyses did not include the heavy mesons comprising both @xmath68 and @xmath69 quarks such as @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the extension of our lfqm to these mesons will be explored in our future communication .",
