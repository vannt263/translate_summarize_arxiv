    "the effective mass ( em ) schrdinger equation with position dependent mass is a very useful model in many applied branches of modern physics , e.  g.   semiconductors @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , and @xmath0he clusters @xcite . in these cases",
    ", the envelope wave function actually provides a macroscopic description of the motion of carrier electrons with position dependent ( or equivalently material - composition dependent ) mass .",
    "recent interest in this field [ 417 ] stems from extraordinary development of nanostructure technology .",
    "this sophisticated technology of semiconductor growth like molecular beam epitaxy technique , makes production of ultrathin ( nonuniform ) semiconductor specimen a reality nowadays .",
    "consequently the study of such em equation becomes relevant for deeper understanding on the non - trivial quantum effects observed in those nanostructures .",
    "another area , where this equation has extensive use , is the study of quantum many - body systems in solids .",
    "for instance , the computational limitation of the green s function quantum monte carlo method is removed by using the so - called pseudopotentials .",
    "the em equation appears in the process when one attempts to replace the nonlocal ( and thus disadvantageous ) angular - momentum projection operator of the pseudopotentials @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "supersymmetric ( susy ) approach @xcite has been proved as a powerful tool in quantum mechanics identifying the isospectral partners in bosonic and fermionic sectors , and thereby generating a hiererchy of solvable hamiltonians @xcite . in the standard susy approach for em",
    "hamiltonians the ladder operators are taken as first order derivative operators similar to constant mass ( cm ) case , but now they depend on both superpotential and mass function .",
    "as a result one obtains two partner em potentials with the same effective mass sharing identical spectra up to the zero mode of supercharge . in the literature",
    "a generalization of standard susy known as higher derivative susy ( hsusy ) or @xmath1-fold susy , find a good usage for cm models [ 2131 ] .",
    "this method keeps the basic superalgebra and differs from standard first order susy in that the supercharges are represented as @xmath1-th order ( @xmath2 ) differential operators .",
    "recently this higher order approach has been extended for em hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "when one is interested in the solvability of the hamiltonian , shape - invariance ( si ) is an important criteria @xcite , because in this case one can obtain full spectra by successive application of raising operator .",
    "for instance , some classes of si hamiltonian have been discovered recently through first order susy formalism @xcite .",
    "our purpose in the present work is to extend the concept of si to second order susy ( ssusy ) in the effective mass framework .",
    "this type of extension has been done very recently @xcite for cm case .",
    "we have derived a new relation between the potential and mass functions , which gives an exactly - solvable ( es ) model satisfying a simple si condition .",
    "two specific examples are given , one is hyperbolic and other is algebraic . both these hamiltonians are new es models , because their wave functions and energy eigenvalues can be obtained by purely algebraic means . for certain values of the characterizing parameter",
    "these potentials acquire an inverse - square singularity at the center .",
    "such type of singular potentials has important applications in various fields e.  g.  molecular and high energy nuclear physics @xcite . in the constant mass limit",
    "both of these reduce to well - known harmonic oscillator or singular oscillator depending on the values of the si parameter .    in section  [ firstorder ]",
    "we set up first order susy for em models .",
    "section  [ secondorder ] is devoted to ssusy . after getting compact expressions for intertwined hamiltonians in terms of superpotentials and mass function ,",
    "we obtain the solution of zero mode equation of supercharges . in section  [ standarsusy ]",
    "we study in detail the connection of the second order scheme with the standard one .",
    "section  [ higherorder ] contains the main result concerning si for ssusy scheme .",
    "a new relation between potential and mass function leading to si model is derived .",
    "two examples satisfying such relation are provided .",
    "finally , section  [ conclusion ] contains the concluding remarks .",
    "the well - known superalgebra defined by the super hamiltonian @xmath3 and the supercharges @xmath4 is @xmath5=[q^{\\dagger},h_s]=0 , \\ ] ] where the symbol ` @xmath6 ' denotes the usual hermitian conjugation .",
    "the supercharges are represented in one dimensional quantum mechanics by the following @xmath7 matrices @xmath8 consequently , the super hamiltonian @xmath3 is diagonalized as @xmath9 in the standard susy approach to em models the ladder operators @xmath10 are first order differential operators @xmath11'\\ , ,     \\qquad \\left(\\partial\\equiv\\frac{d}{dx}\\right ) \\\\\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the em superpotential and the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "note that we have omitted the factor @xmath14 by defining the atomic units such that @xmath15 . denoting @xmath16 as @xmath17 the realization ( [ lad ] ) straightforwardly expresses the schrdinger em potentials in terms of mass and em superpotential @xmath18'\\ , , \\quad      v_-(x)=v_+(x)+2\\frac{{\\mbox{w}}'(x)}{\\sqrt{m(x)}}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m(x ) } }                       \\left [ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m(x)}}\\right ] ' ' .\\ ] ]",
    "the main feature of above construction is the intertwining relations between the bosonic and fermionic parts , which plays a crucial role in susy theory @xmath19 the vacuum states may be characterized as @xmath20 where @xmath21 denote the bound state wave functions for the schrdinger hamiltonian @xmath16 .",
    "let us point out that physically the mass function @xmath22 is positive definite and finite everywhere in the domain of definition of the em schrdinger equation .",
    "now , the existence of a zero mode will depend on the asymptotic nature of the superpotential @xmath12 and mass function @xmath22 .",
    "the ground state wave functions may be computed from equation ( [ vac ] ) @xmath23 \\ , , \\quad         \\psi_0 ^ -(x ) \\propto \\sqrt{m(x)}\\exp \\left              [ \\int^x\\sqrt{m(\\tau)}{\\mbox{w}}(\\tau)d\\tau\\right ] \\ , .\\ ] ] the existence of the vacuum states is ensured if and only if the integrals satisfy the following asymptotic condition @xmath24         \\longrightarrow \\\\[-1.2ex ]         \\scriptstyle x\\rightarrow\\pm \\infty         \\end{array }     + \\infty\\,(\\mbox { or}-\\infty)\\ , .\\ ] ] clearly both of the above conditions can not exist simultaneously and so at most one of the zero modes ( [ gr ] ) will be annihilated in which case susy is unbroken ( or exact ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if neither of the zero modes exist then susy is called spontaneously broken . in this context",
    "it should be kept in mind that this argument fails for periodic hamiltonians @xcite because in that case one usually considers bloch solutions and so the square - integrability criteria disappears [ 3537 ] .",
    "in fact the question of existence of zero modes are related with the specified functional space on which a quantum system is to be considered @xcite . however in this treatise we will not consider periodic models .",
    "thus for the systems defined on linear space it must be safely concluded that two zero modes can not exist simultaneously in the first order susy formalism . in the next section",
    "we will show that this is not the case for the ssusy scheme .    for definiteness ,",
    "let us suppose that the bosonic sector ( @xmath25 ) is fully known and possesses normalizable zero - energy state .",
    "thus , if either @xmath26 or @xmath12 is known , the other can be obtained exactly by formulae ( [ gr ] ) .",
    "now , one can extract full knowledge about the fermionic sector ( @xmath27 ) by the use of the intertwining relations ( [ intw ] ) : @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "let us now consider the em eigenvalue equation @xmath30\\psi ( x)=\\epsilon \\psi ( x)\\ ] ] the first step to study this equation is certainly to choose a suitable form of the hermitian kinetic energy operator @xmath31 .",
    "there is an intrinsic ambiguity in selecting such form as this class of physical problems are suffered from non - commutativity of momentum operator @xmath32 and the effective mass operator @xmath22 .",
    "several forms had been proposed in the literature for @xmath31 , and considerable efforts were made to remove the non - uniqueness of the kinetic energy operator [ 3843 ] .",
    "but still the problem of ambiguity remains a open question in this field .",
    "however one may rely on almost general representation suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath33 the parameters @xmath34 in the above equation are usually called ` ordering parameters ' .",
    "most of the present authors prefer to start from ( [ kin ] ) as this representation includes many special forms used in different context .",
    "for instance , the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite considered following kinetic energy operator to apply first order susy @xmath35 which was first proposed by bendaniel and duke @xcite , and is contained in the general representation ( [ kin ] ) for the special choice @xmath36 . in this connection",
    "we would like to mention an interesting work @xcite where the authors have proposed a new representation of first order susy ladder operators including ambiguity parameters of the kinetic energy operator ( [ kin ] ) and have obtained a substantial generalization over the result of ref .",
    "it is now well - known that @xcite the representation of ladder operators can be made free from the ambiguity parameters [ see equation ( [ lad ] ) ] at the cost of constraining the local potential @xmath37 in equation ( [ eigen1 ] ) with a pseudo potential term @xmath38 thereby considering the so - called effective potential energy @xmath39 .",
    "for the two - parametric representation ( [ kin ] ) of the kinetic energy operator this pseudo potential term is given by @xmath40 where we have absorbed the parameter @xmath41 using the constraint @xmath42 . in what follows we will consider the following general em schrdinger equation @xmath43\\psi(x )              = \\epsilon\\psi(x)\\ , , \\quad \\widetilde{v}_{\\textrm{\\tiny{em}}}(x)=v_{\\textrm{\\tiny{em}}}(x)+\\rho(m)\\ , .\\ ] ] in above equation , @xmath37 represents the local potential strength and the pseudo potential @xmath38 is given by ( [ rho ] ) , the latter depends on the ordering parameters @xmath44 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath44 are real .",
    "the em hamiltonian ( [ ems ] ) may then be identified with bosonic partner hamiltonian @xmath25 in ( [ sch ] ) as @xmath45 by assigning @xmath46 .",
    "the quantity @xmath47 is often termed as factorization energy in the susy procedure @xcite .",
    "we will now replace the intertwining operators @xmath10 in equations ( [ supalg])([lad ] ) by the following second order operators @xmath48 \\partial+\\left [ c(x)-{\\mathcal{w}\\,}'_m(x)\\right ] \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] in which we have used the abbreviation @xmath49 in the following we will use the terminology `` superpotential '' for the function @xmath50 . clearly the super hamiltonian @xmath3 given by ( [ supalg])([supch ] ) , is now a fourth order differential operator , and it will be physically meaningful if it can be expressed as a quadratic polynomial in the usual em schrdinger hamiltonians . thus we will introduce @xmath51    our task is to determine the following matrix identity @xmath52 where @xmath53 are arbitrary fixed real numbers .",
    "after some involved but straightforward steps one may express @xmath54 in terms of @xmath55 , the superpotential @xmath50 and the mass function @xmath22 @xmath56 where the function @xmath55 is given by @xmath57 in above equations the quantity @xmath58 is taken , without loss of generality as @xmath59 it should be emphasized that the quantity @xmath58 may be purely real or purely imaginary according as @xmath60 or @xmath61 .",
    "it is that constant which plays the role of determining reducible or irreducible ssusy @xcite . in the next section",
    "we will show that for hermitian quantum mechanics , ssusy scheme could be reduced to first order susy for real @xmath58 only .",
    "note that the em hamiltonian @xmath62 always commutes with super hamiltonian @xmath3 due to the relation ( [ i d ] ) , and hence both have simultaneous eigenstates .",
    "thus the intertwining relation ( [ intw ] ) implies that schrdinger hamiltonian ( [ emh ] ) is doubly degenerated ( up to zero modes of the supercharges ) , and wave functions are connected according to ( [ rw ] ) , where @xmath63 now denote eigenvalues of @xmath64 .",
    "it should be mentioned that above expressions for @xmath65 and @xmath55 satisfy additional intertwining relations between em hamiltonians @xmath64 @xmath66 this relation is important not only because of its elegant description , but also one can start from the requirement ( [ int2 ] ) , and may obtain expressions ( [ res1 ] ) and ( [ c ] ) .",
    "we will now show that zero modes of both operators ( [ hlad ] ) may exist simultaneously , in contrast to the standard first - order susy . to understand this",
    "let us write down the normalizable solutions of zero mode equations ( [ vac ] ) for supercharges .",
    "note that the equation ( [ vac ] ) becomes a second order differential equation with the replacement of @xmath10 by @xmath67 of ( [ hlad ] ) .",
    "these equations may be brought to the form similar to cm schrdinger equation @xmath68\\phi(x)=0\\ , , \\ ] ] by the transformations @xmath69}\\ , .\\ ] ] the normalizability of @xmath70 clearly depends on functional forms of both superpotential @xmath50 and mass function @xmath22 . to illustrate it ,",
    "consider that @xmath71 in ( [ sc ] ) is identified with normalizable ground state wave function of a known solvable cm hamiltonian by suitably choosing the superpotential @xmath50 .",
    "then the prefactor @xmath71 of @xmath70 in ( [ grh ] ) is well - behaved , and hence both @xmath70 will be normalizable if @xmath22 is also well - behaved and the integral @xmath72 is finite . thus in this instance",
    "both operators ( [ hlad ] ) have normalizable zero modes , as was the situation for cm models .",
    "the explicit solutions for zero - mode states of both supercharges may be written as follows @xmath73}\\ , ,   \\ : \\ : f_{j}(x)=\\frac{m{\\mathcal{w}\\,}_m^2+(-1)^j k_3}{2{\\mathcal{w}\\,}_m}\\ , , \\qquad j=1,2\\ , .\\ ] ]    note that for @xmath74 , @xmath75 and so in that case both operators may have at most one zero mode .",
    "it should be mentioned that both of the zero modes are also formal eigenstates of schrdinger hamiltonians @xmath64 for real @xmath58 only : @xmath76    before concluding the section it may be pointed out that the quantum systems built upon @xmath1-th order representation of ladder operators were categorized as type a @xmath1-fold susy ( see for details refs .",
    "hence it is not difficult to show that the systems investigated in this article are generically special cases of type a 2-fold susy .",
    "furthermore in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown systematically that the zero modes of one higher order supercharge can admit both physical and non - physical states , the latter may be used as a good transformation function to develop new solvable system @xcite .",
    "in the previous section we have derived the expressions for second - order susy partner potentials @xmath65 . in this section",
    "we want to investigate whether @xmath65 may be expressed through standard susy formalism .",
    "that is , to say whether there exist superpotentials @xmath77 in terms of which @xmath65 may be brought to the first order form given by ( [ scp ] ) . to proceed systematically ,",
    "let us write @xmath64 as @xmath78 where @xmath79 are first order em ladder operators and @xmath80 are suitable constants to be determined . in this section we will use the notations @xmath81 and @xmath82 interchangeably for 2-susy partners @xmath64 .",
    "let us consider that @xmath58 is purely real .",
    "assuming for definiteness @xmath83 , two types of solutions for @xmath77 are possible .    * * type i : * @xmath84 + the first order superpotentials are given by @xmath85   \\pm \\left   [ \\frac{{\\mathcal{w}\\,}_m'+k_3}{2{\\mathcal{w}\\,}_m\\sqrt{m}}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left (   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}}\\right ) ' \\right ] .\\ ] ] the relation between second order operators @xmath67 and the first order operators @xmath86 in this case is @xmath87 * * type ii : * @xmath88 @xmath89   \\pm \\left   [ \\frac{{\\mathcal{w}\\,}_m'}{2{\\mathcal{w}\\,}_m\\sqrt{m}}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left (   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}}\\right ) ' \\right ] .\\ ] ] the operator relation ( [ fs1 ] ) becomes @xmath90    we see that both types of reductions are distinct for the superpotential @xmath91 unless @xmath74 .",
    "one may check readily that type i reduction allows factorization of ladder operator @xmath92 in terms of first order operators @xmath86 as @xmath93 however this is not possible for type ii reduction .",
    "but in both cases @xmath65 are in 1-susy form , which is actually important .",
    "their respective 1-susy partners may be written down using the formula ( [ scp ] ) @xmath94 according to standard susy , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are isospectral where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are given by ( [ res1 ] ) .",
    "hence we see that second order susy formalism may give us opportunity of studying two standard susy pairs @xmath99 simultaneously for @xmath100 .",
    "the ground states of both pairs of hamiltonian are zero modes of first order operators @xmath101 given by ( [ pr ] ) .",
    "these can be computed by substituting for @xmath77 from ( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ t2 ] ) ( corresponding to type i and type ii reduction ) into the formulae ( [ gr ] ) for @xmath102 .",
    "for instance the zero modes for the opertors @xmath103 corresponding to type ii reduction are @xmath104 where @xmath105 are given by ( [ gr222 ] ) and @xmath106 denote ground state wave functions for the hamiltonians @xmath107 for @xmath100 respectively .",
    "let us point out that for imaginary @xmath58 , given by ( [ k3 ] ) , the above reduction is not possible in hermitian quantum mechanics @xcite , because both first order superpotentials @xmath77 will be complex [ see equations ( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ t2 ] ) ] .",
    "in fact this will lead us to an irreducible transformation between real and complex potentials for em hamltonians @xcite .",
    "the discussion in this section clearly shows that the factorization of a higher order linear differential operator in terms of lower order operators is in general non - unique .",
    "that is to say , one operator can admit both reducible and irreducible representations .",
    "hence from strictly mathematical sense the concept of reducibility of hsusy must be defined on the basis of an additional restriction on hamiltonians that they are factorizable according to ( [ t1 ] ) or ( [ t2 ] ) . in the next section",
    "we will propose a higher order si criteria for em hamiltonians .",
    "our purpose of introducing this section is to compare the result of si obtained through hsusy with that obtained via first order susy .",
    "this will give us a better insight about why and how si scheme proposed in this article is an important generalization over the si formalism in the standard approach .",
    "in ref .  @xcite two types of si criteria were discussed for em hamiltonian generated through first order susy let apart the generalized treatment proposed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "recently a kind of deformed si criteria has been introduced @xcite , which is also in the context of standard susy .",
    "searching for si hamiltonian is useful , because this integrability condition leads to certain relation between potential and mass functions producing an es model .",
    "for instance , claiming first order susy partners @xmath108 , from equation ( [ scp ] ) , one obtains following relation between first order superpotential @xmath12 and mass @xmath22 : @xmath109 just this relation was discovered in ref  @xcite . here",
    "we wish to enquire this simple si condition for ssusy partners @xmath110 , given by ( [ res1 ] ) .",
    "let us consider @xmath111 it is not very difficult to see that the above requirement expresses second order superpotential in the form @xmath112 where @xmath113 is an integration constant . substituting this expression for @xmath50 into ( [ res1 ] ) for @xmath114",
    ", we obtain following relation between potential and mass @xmath115 where we are considering @xmath83 .",
    "we stress that this is a new relation between potential and mass which gives us a class of si hamiltonian @xmath116 .",
    "the whole set @xmath117 of eigenstates and spectra for @xmath116 can be constructed by exploiting the intertwining relation ( [ int2 ] ) .",
    "the procedure is , as in the case for harmonic oscillator , to apply successively the raising operator @xmath118 upon zero mode of the lowering operator @xmath92 .",
    "note that the second order operator @xmath92 has two zero modes @xmath119 , given by ( [ gr222 ] ) .",
    "both these zero modes are formal solutions of schrdinger equation for @xmath116 [ see equation ( [ formal ] ) ] with the eigenvalues @xmath120 and @xmath121 , where @xmath122 .",
    "hence we obtain double sequences of eigenstates based on both zero modes .",
    "the labels of eigenstates will depend on the values of the si parameter @xmath123 in equation ( [ si ] ) . for simplicity",
    "let us first consider the case @xmath124 in this case the wave functions and energy eigenvalues of @xmath125 may be expressed as follows @xmath126    we will now turn to the case for @xmath127 .",
    "note that for all values of @xmath128 , the ground state will be given by the zero mode @xmath129 with the eigenvalue @xmath130 .",
    "higher excited states will be obtained in a similar procedure as described above , but one has to relabel the states according to the range of values of @xmath123 .",
    "to illustrate let us take the most general situation where @xmath131 here first @xmath132 members will be given by the sequence based on the zero mode @xmath129 .",
    "thus the wave functions are @xmath133 with the spectra @xmath134 it is a trivial exercise to verify that for @xmath135 , the sequence built on @xmath136 coincides with that built on @xmath129 except for the first @xmath132 members , which are the lowest states and only singular solutions .",
    "the wave functions and spectra will be provided by single sequence @xmath137    it should also be kept in mind that for ssusy scheme , zero modes of both operators @xmath92 and @xmath118 may simultaneously exist .",
    "this implies that the above sequences may terminate at @xmath138 if @xmath139 @xmath140 being the possible zero modes of @xmath118 , given by ( [ gr222 ] ) .",
    "note that for @xmath141 , we have from ( [ finwave ] ) harmonic - oscillator - like spectra @xmath142 while for @xmath143 , the spectra given by ( [ finwave ] ) , ( [ finwave2b ] ) or ( [ finwave3 ] ) separately coincide with those of singular oscillator .",
    "under the si condition ( [ si ] ) , all levels can be obtained in a closed analytic form .",
    "for instance , first three members of the sequence @xmath144 are @xmath145^{\\frac{\\lambda- k_3}{2\\lambda}}\\textrm{e}^{-\\frac{g^2(x)}{4\\lambda}}\\ , ,   \\quad { \\mathcal{a}}^{\\dagger}\\psi_{0,2}^+(x)\\propto \\left [ g^2(x)+k_3 - 2\\lambda\\right ] \\psi_{0,2}^+(x)\\ , , \\\\ [ 1ex ]     \\left ( { \\mathcal{a}}^{\\dagger}\\right ) ^2 \\psi_{0,2}^+(x)\\propto \\left [ \\left ( g^2(x)+k_3 - 4\\lambda\\right ) ^2                                + 2\\lambda\\left ( k_3 - 4\\lambda\\right ) \\right ] \\psi_{0,2}^+(x)\\ , .",

    "the members of the other sequence @xmath146 can be obtained by simply changing the sign of @xmath58 in the corresponding members of the sequence @xmath147 .",
    "the nature of the function @xmath148 given by ( [ sup ] ) is crucial for the normalizability of the wave functions . in the first place",
    ", @xmath22 must be so chosen that it verifies @xmath149 as @xmath150 and remains finite otherwise .",
    "secondly , suppose that @xmath148 is nodeless in the whole domain .",
    "then the potential @xmath151 is non - singular and both sequences provide regular ( non - singular ) solutions .",
    "but if @xmath148 has a node at @xmath152 then the potential is singular at that point for @xmath143 .",
    "let us note that the node of @xmath148 is of first order , because @xmath153 is always nodeless for chosen mass function .",
    "hence near @xmath154 , @xmath114 will behave like @xmath155 , where the constant @xmath156 characterizes the strength of the singularity .",
    "it is well - known that self - adjoint extension of such hamiltonian can be determined on the whole domain for the range @xmath157 .",
    "the singularity will be attractive or repulsive according as @xmath158 or @xmath159 .",
    "one may readily check from ( [ finwave1 ] ) that @xmath160 is singular for @xmath161 , and so in this case depending on the values of @xmath123 and other parameters some or all of the members of the sequence @xmath147 have to be deleted from the set of regular solutions of @xmath125 .",
    "hence we have proved that the hamiltonian @xmath125 with the potential @xmath151 in ( [ ssi ] ) is a new es model possessing second order si condition in the em framework .",
    "two remarks are in order . as one lowers the value of @xmath123 by increasing the value of @xmath132 in ( [ range2 ] ) ,",
    "the levels become closer and closer and in the limit @xmath162 only two levels will be left namely @xmath160 and @xmath163 with the eigenvalues @xmath164 respectively .",
    "clearly this gives a quasi - exactly solvable system with two known levels .",
    "since in this article we are only interested about es models , @xmath132 will be a finite quantity or equivalently the si parameter @xmath123 is a strictly non - zero finite positive number .",
    "secondly we have already mentioned that if the function @xmath148 in ( [ sup ] ) has a node at @xmath152 , the potential @xmath151 given by ( [ ssi ] ) will be singular at that point .",
    "hence extreme care should be taken to decrease ( or increase ) the value of @xmath123 in order to keep the strength @xmath156 of the singularity controlled ( @xmath157 ) , as for a given mass function @xmath22 and the constant @xmath58 the strength @xmath156 is inversely proportional with @xmath123",

    "the potential acquires an inverse - square singularity for @xmath143 , which is repulsive ( attractive ) for @xmath159 ( @xmath200 ) . for weakly repulsive singularity ( @xmath201 )",

    "physically the well confining the particle is divided into two zones by a high thin barrier at @xmath207 . but note that for weakly repulsive case this barrier is penetrable by a quantum - mechanical particle .      in subsection  [ theory ]",
    "we have proposed a second order si condition ( [ si ] ) and consequently have obtained a new system of es hamiltonians @xmath125 where the potential @xmath151 and the mass @xmath22 are related according to ( [ ssi ] ) . here",
    "we wish to show that the same system ( [ ssi ] ) ( up to a constant shift ) could be studied through first order si formalism provided the hamiltonians are factorizable according to ( [ t1 ] ) or ( [ t2 ] ) . to see this , consider the 1-susy pair @xmath208 given by ( [ res1 ] ) and ( [ part0 ] ) corresponding to type ii reduction ( [ t2 ] ) . here",

    "in the following we will use the symbol @xmath209 for @xmath58 .",
    "the relation between first order superpotential @xmath210 and the mass function @xmath22 reads from ( [ t2 ] ) and ( [ sup ] ) @xmath211 to have zero energy ground state , consider the hamiltonian @xmath212 , where the operator @xmath213 is given by ( [ pr ] ) and @xmath214 for type ii reduction .",

    "two points are to be noted .",
    "firstly imposing the restriction of factorizability on the hamiltonians one would come out with the si condition ( [ rsis ] ) and the relation ( [ rsi ] ) , which have not been reported so far in the literature for em hamiltonian .",
    "secondly the proposed ssusy scheme definitely leads to a generalized si criteria ( [ si ] ) , because in this case no such restrictions need to be imposed on the hamiltonians .",
    "our final remark is that in the cm limit @xmath225 , is taken to tally with the conventional choice of atomic units @xmath226 for constant mass @xmath227 . ]",
    "both potentials @xmath151 , given by ( [ si2 ] ) and ( [ si1 ] ) reduce to known si potential @xmath228 : @xmath229 and the wave functions and energy eigenvalues exactly coincide with those @xcite for ( [ cmsi ] ) .",
    "in this article we have used ssusy scheme for describing dynamics of a quantum particle with a position - dependent mass .",
    "we have derived a compact expression of 2-susy pairs @xmath110 in terms of second order superpotential @xmath50 and the mass function @xmath22 .",
    "a detailed analysis has been given about zero mode equations of second order supercharges and possible reduction of ssusy scheme to first order susy .",
    "based on the existence of intertwining relation between 2-susy partner hamiltonians @xmath64 , we have obtained a new relation between potential @xmath114 and mass @xmath22 leading to a simple si condition . as a result full spectra",
    "is achieved by successive application of second order raising operator @xmath118 upon the zero modes of the lowering operator @xmath92 .",
    "it is shown that in the reduced first order susy approach , one may obtain a new relation between first order superpotential @xmath230 and mass @xmath22 and the same system ( up to a constant shift ) could possess a first order si property provided the hamiltonians are factorizable .",
    "the advantage of using ssusy scheme is that it deals with a generalized but simpler si requirement , namely partner hamiltonians differ by a constant @xmath123 .",
    "we have constructed explicit examples for two types of position - dependence of mass function , one is hyperbolic and the other is algebraic .",
    "the corresponding potentials have very different aspects based on the values of the si parameter @xmath123 . both are non - singular for @xmath141 , where the constant @xmath58 appears in the process of relating schrdinger hamiltonian with super hamiltonian . the parameters @xmath180 and @xmath177 characterizes position - dependence of mass ( [ ex1 ] ) and ( [ ex2 ] ) respectively .",
    "the non - singular algebraic potential ( [ si1 ] ) shares same qualitative features as those discovered in ref .",
    "for @xmath143 , the potentials acquire an inverse square singularity , which is attractive ( repulsive ) for @xmath200 ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "the week strength of singularity ( @xmath157 ) is particularly of physical interest . because for weakly attractive singularity ( @xmath184 ) the ground state energy remains finite . on the other hand , for weakly repulsive singularity ( @xmath201 )",
    "the barrier is penetrable by quantum - mechanical particle . in both instances ,",
    "regular ( non - singular ) wave functions vanish at the center of the singularity .",
    "it is important to clarify that the novelty of our work lies in the fact that we have generalized for the first time the concept of si to the second order susy approach for em hamiltonians . in this context",
    "one should look into the explicit classification done in ref .",
    "@xcite via @xmath1-fold susy approach to em quantum systems .",
    "the systems investigated in this article belong to a special subclass of the systems studied there , which possess second order shape - invariance .",
    "hence one has a significant advantage of obtaining wave functions and energy eigenvalues for such hamiltonians over the existing general method for arbitrary potential and mass functions .",
    "we would like to mention that in many practical applications , where continuous spectra is of interest @xcite , ssusy scheme used here may be utilized to relate transmission and reflection amplitudes of partner hamiltonians .",
    "the idea of si condition for ssusy scheme can be straightforwardly extended to general @xmath1-th order representation ( @xmath231 ) of ladder operators .",
    "however obtaining a physical model will be much more difficult , because one has to make an appropriate choice of the mass function as well as of the coefficient functions in the ladder operators .",
