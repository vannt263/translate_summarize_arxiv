    "the production of @xmath3 mesons in low energy @xmath1 annihilation ( see @xcite and references therein ) is strongly enhanced in some channels for which the @xmath3 production is expected to be suppressed on the tree level according to the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule @xcite .",
    "these conspicuously ozi rule violating reactions are of considerable theoretical interest since they can be used for studying reaction mechanisms and the nucleon structure , in particular the problem of an intrinsic @xmath5 component @xcite .",
    "some well - known ozi - rule breaking mechanisms are two - step processes with ordinary hadrons in the intermediate state @xcite , therefore their role in the @xmath1 annihilation must be investigated .",
    "the two step mechanisms in nucleon - antinucleon annihilation have been studied for various final states containing @xmath3 mesons @xcite .",
    "it has been found that in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 channels , which show the most dramatic violation of the ozi rule , two - step mechanisms play an important role and result in a cross section comparable with the experimental data .",
    "however , for a number of reactions , including @xmath8 , no significant contributions from two - step mechanisms have been found .",
    "the goal of this paper is to reanalyze the role of two - step mechanisms for the @xmath1 annihilation into the @xmath4 channel . to this aim",
    "we go beyond the approximations used in previous studies .",
    "the resulting cross sections turn out to have the right order of magnitude .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ exp ] gives a brief summary of the experimental data and the previous calculations .",
    "a simple model illustrating the two - step mechanism with a resonant final state interaction is considered in sec .",
    "[ rrm ] . the reaction @xmath9 is discussed in sec",
    ".  [ rrmphipipi ] where the two - step mechanism with the @xmath2 intermediate state is studied in detail .",
    "the summary of the results is given in sec .",
    "[ concl ] . for earlier reviews concerning the two - step mechanisms we refer to @xcite .",
    "table  [ oziphirho ] gives a summary of the experimental data on the ozi rule violation in the @xmath0 and @xmath11 channels at different energies .",
    "the tree level expectations based on the deviation of the @xmath12 mixing angle from the ideal one are @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the ozi rule violation in these channels is therefore rather moderate production exceeds the estimate from @xmath14 mixing by more than one order of magnitude . ] .",
    "the experimental branching ratios for the reactions @xmath15 at rest are given in tab .",
    "[ tabpipikk ] .",
    ".[oziphirho ] the relative probabilities for the @xmath16 and @xmath17 channels in @xmath1 annihilation _ vs. _ antiproton momentum .",
    "phase space corrected ratios of yields are also tabulated .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]",
    "we have developed a general formalism describing resonant final state interaction in a multiparticle system .",
    "this mechanism is shown to play an important role in nucleon - antinucleon annihilation into ozi - rule breaking channels ( @xmath4 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "the resonant rescattering mechanism @xmath18 is studied in detail .",
    "off - mass - shell contributions are found to be very significant for this process , while the unitarity approximation is small .",
    "the interference of the resonant term with the nonresonant background which is essential for providing a correct analytical structure of the total amplitude in the case of elastic resonant rescattering , leads to the characteristic peak - dip structure of the invariant @xmath19 mass distribution for @xmath20 .",
    "this feature can help to distinguish the resonant fsi mechanism from other mechanisms of @xmath3 production when high resolution partial wave analysis of the @xmath19 production becomes available .",
    "the @xmath3 peak can get an additional enhancement due to this interference effect .",
    "the rate of the @xmath4 production at rest from the @xmath21 state is in good agreement with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "thus no unexplained ozi rule violation is required in this case  the same conclusion was obtained earlier for the @xmath22 , @xmath7 , @xmath23 channels as well ( see @xcite and references therein ) . the @xmath3 production due to resonant fsi decreases with increasing total energy as the fraction of the total phase space favourable for the resonance formation gets smaller .",
    "this feature agrees with the general trend of the ozi rule violation in the nucleon - antinucleon annihilation which is decreasing as a function of energy",
    ". it would be desirable to extend the present approach to the case when resonant fsi effects are taken into account simultaneously in the different subsystems mentioned earlier in order to achieve a unified description of the production of the @xmath3 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 resonances .",
    "we are grateful to m.  sapozhnikov and b .- s .",
    "zou for stimulating discussions .",
    "the differential @xmath26-particle phase space @xmath27 is defined by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the total four - momentum of the particles with four - momenta @xmath30 .",
    "the phase space reduction formula has the form @xmath31 the total @xmath26-particle phase space for the decay @xmath32 is @xmath33",
    "in order to describe the resonant final state interaction in a two - particle system , we introduce a variant of the weisskopf - wigner ( ww ) model with two channels .",
    "channel 1 is the scattering channel of interest , and channel 2 has a bound state @xmath34 with bare mass @xmath35 ( the rest of the dynamics in the second channel is ignored ) .",
    "the only interaction in the model results from the coupling between the channels .",
    "the @xmath36-matrix , as a function of the invariant mass squared @xmath37 , is defined by the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the interaction between channels 1 and 2 and @xmath40 and @xmath40 are the free green functions : @xmath41 here @xmath42 denotes the free two - particle state with relative momentum @xmath43 , both particles have the same mass @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "we assume the channel coupling to have the following form ( all particles are spinless ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the coupling constant and @xmath48 characterizes the range of interaction .",
    "the solution for the scattering amplitude in channel 1 has the form @xmath49 where the mass operator @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 from eqs.([f11],[pis ] ) the poles of the amplitude can be easily found . for the sake of illustration we consider the case of weak coupling ( the bare state @xmath52 is assumed to be above the threshold of the scattering channel ) ,",
    "then the scattering amplitude has a resonance pole at @xmath53 .",
    "the resonance shift @xmath54 and width @xmath55 due to the coupling to the open channel have the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "now we consider the decay @xmath58 described by a pointlike vertex with a coupling constant @xmath59 .",
    "using standard results from scattering theory we find that the decay amplitude with the final state interaction between particles 1 and 2 taken into account is proportional to the scattering wave function at zero distance @xmath60 between particles 1 and 2 .",
    "the result for the above described model has the form @xmath61 where the relative momentum @xmath62 is related to the the square of the invariant mass of the subsystem ( 1 + 2 ) : @xmath63    formula ( [ fa123 ] ) can be rewritten explicitly showing the pole - zero structure of the amplitude : @xmath64 note that the nominator in ( [ fabccm ] ) is a real function for real @xmath65 which has a zero at @xmath66 .",
