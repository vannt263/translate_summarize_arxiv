    "spherical accretion into black holes as a compton upscattering problem of low frequency photons was studied by blandford and payne ( blandford & payne 1981a , henceforth bp ; payne & blandford 1981 , henceforth pb ) . especially in",
    "pb the above authors solved the photon transfer equation in the case of a steady state spherically symmetric supercritical accretion into a central black hole with the assumptions of power law flow velocity and cold electrons @xmath1 .",
    "an extension of the work of pb on accreting black holes to include the thermal motions of the electrons along with the bulk motion was performed by colpi ( 1988 ) .",
    "however , in the papers mentioned above , the authors solved the photon transfer equation under the assumption that the inflow extends up to the center ( @xmath2 ) and thus its thickness is infinite .",
    "lyubarskij & sunyaev ( 1982 ) solved the radiation transfer equation in the case of a _ finite _ optically thick medium . in a extension of the work of blandford & payne ( 1981b ) , they studied comptonization in a radiation - dominated shock , taking into account not only the bulk motion of the electrons but also their thermal motion .",
    "in this paper we present the emergent spectrum from a spherical inflow by taking into account the effects of bulk motion and thermal comptonization in addition to the boundary conditions of the inflow . for proofs and detailed discussions",
    "the reader is referred to our long paper ( titarchuk , mastichiadis and kylafis 1996 , henceforth tmk ) . by extending the relevant work of mastichiadis & kylafis ( 1992 , henceforth mk92 ) we allowed the inner boundary to be anything from fully reflective to fully absorptive assigning the former case to a neutron star and the latter to a black hole . also , we determined the eigenvalues of the problem as functions of the mass accretion rate and we found numerically and analytically the general solution for the spectrum as well as its asymptotic forms .",
    "the obtained results in the black hole case show a remarkable similarity with the x - ray spectra of the galactic black hole candidates in their high states . in ",
    "2 we present the solution of the radiative transfer problem while in  3 we give some examples and draw our conclusions .",
    "consider a spherically symmetric accretion onto a compact object with mass rate @xmath3 , where the bulk velocity of the infalling plasma is given by @xmath4^{1/2 } ~ , \\eqno(1)\\ ] ] with @xmath5 the speed of light , @xmath6 the schwarzschild radius and @xmath7 the ratio of the escaping luminosity to the eddington one .",

    "consider next low energy photons that find themselves in the accretion flow .",
    "as the photons diffuse outward , they scatter off the inflowing electrons gaining energy on average . at some characteristic radius , called the trapping radius ( rees 1978 ; begelman 1979 ) , the conditions of optical depth and velocity of the inflowing electrons are such that the photons are advected inwards at the same rate as the one with which they diffuse outwards .",
    "photons that either are emitted inside the trapping radius or find themselves there can not escape easily , but if they do , they gain significant amount of energy .",
    "let us investigate next the relative importance of the bulk ( converging flow ) and the thermal motion of the electrons to the mean photon energy change per scattering .",
    "the mean energy gain per scattering of a photon by thermal comptonization @xmath18 is proportional to @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath20 . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean energy gain @xmath21 in the presence of a converging flow is proportional to @xmath22 ( e.g. , bp ) . by using equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) we write @xmath23",
    "thus , we have @xmath24 , where @xmath25",
    "this can be further written as @xmath26 , with @xmath27 kev ) .",
    "hence , the bulk motion comptonization dominates the thermal one if @xmath28 .",
    "the dominant power - law and the high - energy cutoff of the spectrum can be understood in the following way : as it was shown above , the fractional increase in energy of a low - energy photon in its collision with accreting electrons of bulk velocity @xmath29 and temperature @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 .",
    "at the same time , the recoil effects cause a fractional decrease in the energy of the photon given by @xmath32 . when @xmath33 , the recoil effect is negligible , resulting in a pure power - law spectrum . at high energies the two effects are comparable and the turnover in the spectrum occurs at @xmath34 , or @xmath35 when @xmath36 .",
    "the radiation spectrum observed at infinity can be found by solving the equation of radiative transfer for the photon occupation number @xmath37 ( eqn . [ 18 ] of bp ) .",
    "we remind the reader that the bp equation does not take fully into account general relativistic effects ; also the associated diffusion coefficient has been derived in a fully self consistent manner .",
    "both of these issues have been recently discussed ( zannias & titarchuk 1996 , henceforth zt96 ) .",
    "the two boundary conditions of the radiative transfer equation can be formulated in terms of the spectral energy flux @xmath38 ( cf .",
    "[ 21 ] of bp ) .",
    "the first is that the total spectral flux integrated over the photosphere should depend only on @xmath39 as @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "the second boundary condition is that we have a boundary with albedo @xmath42 at some radius @xmath43 .",
    "the net energy flux through this surface is @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath30 is the electron temperature considered to be constant throughout the flow . from the setup of the problem",
    ", @xmath43 is the smallest value that the variable @xmath46 can obtain .    if the inner boundary is fully reflective ( @xmath47 ) , all input photons escape .",
    "this is the problem considered in mk92 who pointed out the analogy of the fully reflective boundary to a neutron star surface . on the other hand , if the inner boundary is fully absorptive ( @xmath48 ) , then we have the equivalent of a black - hole horizon . however , since we do not take an infinite atmosphere but we consider instead a _ finite _ flow extending up to @xmath43 , our case is different from the one considered in pb and colpi ( 1988 ) .",
    "relativistic effects close to the horizon of the compact object have been ignored .",
    "the radiative transfer equation , satisfying the above formulated boundary conditions is solved in tmk .",
    "this solution is extended in zt96 by taking into account relativistic corrections .",
    "the spectra are calculated numerically by using the iteration method to solve the boundary problem of the appropriate fokker - planck equation .",
    "the analytic approximation found by the separation of variables method describes satisfactorily the emergent spectra in the whole energy range up to the high energy turnover @xmath49 .",
    "alternatively , as it is shown by tmk , this approximation can be written as a sum of two components : the low frequency injection is presented by a coherent solution and the high energy tail is presented by the fundamental mode .",
    "this mode can be presented by a convolution of the low - frequency source spectrum and the green function @xmath50 given by @xmath51 for @xmath52 and by @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "here @xmath55 , @xmath56^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the first eigenvalue of the appropriate boundary problem and the spectral index is determined by @xmath59 the normalization of @xmath50 is chosen in such a way as to keep the photon number equal to @xmath60 .    as we noted earlier ,",
    "the parameter which shows the importance of the bulk comptonization effects relative to thermal comptonization is @xmath61 , given by eqn .",
    "( 4 ) . in the case where @xmath62 and @xmath63 , then @xmath64 and this leads immediately to an _ asymptotic _ relation for the energy spectral index @xmath65 @xmath66 as long as @xmath64 , bulk comptonization effects dominate the thermal ones and the value of @xmath65 is independent of the temperature of the electrons .    this boundary condition , along with the radiative equation implies that the eigenvalues are the roots of the equation ( tmk ) @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69\\left[{{r_b}\\over{r_s(1-\\ell)}}\\right]^{1/2 } ~. \\eqno(10)\\ ] ] by using eqns .",
    "( 9 - 10 ) it can be demonstrated ( tmk ) that the spectrum becomes harder as @xmath42 increases .",
    "the dependence of the spectral index on the albedo @xmath42 is displayed in figure 1 .",
    "we point out that for @xmath48 the power - law index @xmath65 is always larger than 1 and approaches 1.5 for @xmath70 . for the fully reflective inner boundary case ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "thus , the hardest spectral slope ( @xmath73 ) corresponds to the fully reflective inner boundary as it was shown in mk92 .",
    "= 6.5 cm    of special interest is the case of a fully absorptive boundary @xmath48 .",
    "the obtained in this case spectral energy power - law index @xmath65 is shown in figure 2 as a function of @xmath11 . as it can be seen , the spectral index is a weak function of the electron temperature in the wide range of mass accretion rates @xmath74 and electron temperatures @xmath75 kev .",
    "the temperature dependence of the spectral index becomes stronger for very high accretion rates @xmath76 and for electron temperatures @xmath77 kev .",
    "a second important consequence of the solution is that , despite the presence of the exponential in front of the integral in equation ( 6b ) , the power law can extend to @xmath78 ( see tmk ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath36 , the power law extends to energies of order @xmath0 independently of the electron temperature . only for energies",
    "@xmath79 the spectrum exhibits an exponential turnover .",
    "= 6.5 cm    figure 3 shows a comparison between the analytical approximation where the hard tail of the specrum is presented by eqn . ( 6b ) and the numerical solution .",
    "the analytical approximation represents the emergent spectrum quite reliably in the whole energy range below the exponential turnover . in this region",
    "two effects , the bulk motion upscattering and the compton ( recoil ) downscattering , compete forming the hard tail . because the analytical representation does not take into account properly the inner boundary condition at energies @xmath80 there is a significant deviation of the analytical curve from the numerical solution close to the cut - off .",
    "when one takes into consideration the relativistic corrections , the hard tail becomes flatter , since compton downscattering is less efficient at high energies ( zt96 ) .    in figure 4",
    "the spectra are presented for different mass accretion rates . here",
    "( as in fig .",
    "3 ) we have assumed external illumination of the converging flow by the low - energy black body radiation of an accretion disk having a characteristic temperature @xmath81 ; furthermore we have assumed a space source distribution of the form ( see , for example , sobolev 1975 ) @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a normalization constant and @xmath84 is the cosine of the angle of incidence at @xmath85 .",
    "all spectra are pure power laws in the high energy range from 15 kev up to the exponential turnover , which occurs at energy @xmath86 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , despite the fact that the accretion rate is taken to vary from 2 to @xmath87 , the resulting energy spectra have indices around 1.5 .",
    "= 6.5 cm    = 6.5 cm",
    "we have solved numerically and analytically the radiative transfer equation in the diffusion approximation in the case of thermal electrons infalling spherically onto a compact object .",
    "we have considered a finite medium ( as opposed to an infinite medium considered in the related work of pb and colpi [ 1988 ] ) taking as inner boundary a totally absorptive or reflective surface , in the case where the compact object is a black hole or a neutron star , respectively .",
    "we have shown that the escaping spectral energy flux exhibits an extended power law at high energies up to a few hundred kev and has an index that depends on the inner boundary condition .",
    "the important parameter ( in addition to the albedo introduced through the inner boundary condition ) which determines the spectral slope is @xmath61 ( eq . 4 ) and as long as this remains much greater than unity the upscattering is mainly due to the bulk motion of the electrons .",
    "therefore we find that , for a wide range of values of the dimensionless accretion rate @xmath11 and of the electron temperature @xmath30 , the spectral slope is insensitive to both of these quantities .",
    "the above conclusion is especially true in the case of accretion into a black hole ( absorptive boundary ) .",
    "the dominant energy spectral index takes values around 1.5 for a wide variety of @xmath11 ranging from 1.5 to 10 ( see figs .",
    "furthermore , this spectral index appears to be independent of the electron temperature as long as this remains below 10 kev ( see fig .",
    "_ therefore we propose that our calculations may offer an explanation for the spectra observed by black - hole candidates in their high states _",
    "( e.g. ebisawa et al . 1993 , sunyaev et al .",
    "1994  for a recent review see tanaka & lewin 1995 ) .",
    "the situation is changed only when either the temperature of the electrons is higher than 10 kev or when the escaping luminosity approaches the eddington limit . in this last case",
    "the parameter @xmath61 is reduced due to the radiative force . in both cases the spectra are dominated by thermal comptonization and are related to the hard spectra of black holes and neutron stars .    _",
