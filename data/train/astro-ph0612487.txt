    "the standard way to obtain an evolving state parameter @xmath6 is to include scalar fields into a cosmological model . under general assumptions within single scalar field four - dimensional models",

    "for simplicity we put @xmath181 and construct solutions , which do not depend on @xmath182 . in this case @xmath183 using ( [ eom2 ] ) we can define the following explicit form of solutions : @xmath184    it is easy to check that if @xmath185 then @xmath186 let construct the superpotential : @xmath187 so @xmath188 the potential is ( we put @xmath100 ) @xmath189    thus we obtain the explicit solutions and the fourth degree polynomial potential , which corresponds to the hubble parameter from the sft inspired model with high derivatives .",
    "note that the standard method to construct models with scalar fields for the given behaviour of the hubble parameter is the method , which uses @xmath45 as a function of time  @xcite .",
    "if we know the hubble parameter @xmath46 , then , using ( [ vt ] ) , we obtain @xmath190 and after that we can attempt to find the functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 and the potential @xmath45 .",
    "such method is very effective if at least one of derivatives either @xmath191 or @xmath192 is such a function @xmath193 that a form of @xmath194 does not depend on @xmath24 and @xmath27 .",
    "for example , if @xmath195 where @xmath196 is a constant , then @xmath197 and ( [ eom4 ] ) is a linear differential equation in @xmath27 @xmath198 this equation allows to find @xmath44 if the hubble parameter @xmath46 is known  @xcite .",
    "the superpotential method is not so effective to seek potential in the form ( [ vexp ] ) for the given hubble parameter @xmath46 . on the other hand",
    "if the required form of the potential is a polynomial , the superpotential method is not less effective and maybe even more easy to use than the above - mentioned method .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the dynamics of two component de models , with one phantom field and one usual field .",
    "the main motivation for us is a model of the universe as a slowly decaying d3-brane , whose dynamics is described by a tachyon field  @xcite . to take into account the back reaction of gravity we add a scalar field with an usual kinetic term .",
    "we construct a cosmological model with the sft inspired polynomial potential @xmath45 and find two - parameter set of exact solutions .",
    "this set can be separated into two subset such that one subset corresponds to the quintessence large time behaviour , another subset corresponds to the phantom one .",
    "note that both subsets have solutions , which satisfy one and the same asymptotic conditions and the additional condition @xmath57 .",
    "we also construct two - fields model with the fourth degree polynomial potential , which corresponds to the hubble parameter , obtained in the sft framework  @xcite . in this model the state parameter @xmath25 crosses the cosmological constant barrier infinitely often .    in this paper",
    "we actively use the superpotential method and show that there are new ways to use this method in the case of two fields .",
    "we can not only construct potential for the given solutions , but also find new solutions .",
    "in particular superpotential method allows to generalize a one - parameter set of solutions up to two - parameter set .",
    "the superpotential method allows to separate the initial system of motion equations  ( [ eom1])([eom4 ] ) into two parts .",
    "one part is the equation on superpotential  ( [ dewolfe_potential ] ) , which in general case is not integrable , but for many polynomial potentials has special solutions . substituting these solutions into the second part ( system  ( [ dewolfe_method1])([dewolfe_method2 ] ) ) we obtain a system of ordinary differential equations , which is usually integrable at least in quadratures .",
    "note that the systems of the type ( [ dewolfe_method1])([dewolfe_method2 ] ) are actively investigated both in mechanics and in supersymmetry theories with bps states .",
    "so , the superpotential method allows to stand out from the system of the friedmann equations a subsystem , which can be integrable , even in the case of a nonintegrable initial system . on the other hand",
    "this method allows to make such a fine tuning of parameters of the considering gravitational models , for example , a choose of coefficients of the potential , that the explicit solutions exist .    for solutions with @xmath137",
    "we obtain that @xmath136 .",
    "similar solutions are known as bounce ones ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "note , that bounce solutions has been obtained in the sft inspired higher - derivative models  @xcite .",
