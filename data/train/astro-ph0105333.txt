    "although the model atmosphere grid has been calculated with a resolution of 1 dex in @xmath34 , only representative models are shown here . as expected ,",
    "the infrared flux deficiency becomes more important as the helium abundance is gradually increased , until it reaches a maximum at @xmath35 .",
    "simultaneously , the peak of the energy distribution moves towards shorter wavelengths , and the slope of the optical regions becomes steeper ( the star appears bluer ) .",
    "when the helium abundance is further increased , h@xmath15-he cia becomes only a small contribution to the total opacity , the infrared depression weakens , and the peak of the energy distribution rapidly shifts towards longer wavelengths .",
    "similar results were obtained by @xcite in two - color diagrams ( see their figs .  6 and 7 ) , although the convergence on the pure helium sequence that occurs at @xmath36 in our models was not reached in their analysis .",
    "note that the most extreme helium abundance models discussed here do not take into account the nonideal effects included in the equation - of - state of the pure helium model grid calculated by @xcite , and as such , these models should be considered illustrative only .",

    "hence a good fit could be achieved with @xmath44 , which is qualitatively similar to the best fit obtained in figure 8 of oppenheimer et al .",
    "our fit could even perhaps be improved by allowing @xmath38 and @xmath45 to vary .",
    "we also note that the discrepancy observed for the @xmath46 bandpass in the lower panel of figure [ fg : f2 ] is also present in the solution of oppenheimer et al . , but this discrepancy becomes less apparent when the solution is presented in terms of @xmath42 ( upper panel ) .",
    "both solutions differ quantitatively by nearly 3 orders of magnitude in helium abundance , however .",
    "the origin of this difference is unknown , but may stem from the differences in the input physics used in the two model sets .",
    "the important aspect of both solutions nevertheless remains that an _ extremely high helium abundance is required to fit the observed energy distribution of wd 0346@xmath0246_.    such a low hydrogen content of only @xmath47 is quite unrealistic , however .",
    "indeed , the white dwarf cooling age of wd 0346@xmath0246implied by our atmospheric parameter determination is 9.6 gyr ( using the thick layer evolutionary models described above ; thin layer models yield 8.9 gyr ) , during which the star has been traveling across the galaxy , accreting material from the interstellar medium , including large amounts of hydrogen . even though elements heavier than helium will rapidly sink below the photosphere because of the efficient gravitational chemical separation that exists in white dwarf atmospheres",
    ", hydrogen will tend to float to the surface in the absence of competing mechanisms .",
    "in other words , _",
    "the hydrogen abundance can only increase with time_. since the superficial layers of cool white dwarfs are strongly convective , however , hydrogen accreted from the interstellar medium will be homogeneously mixed with the helium convective zone . below @xmath48",
    "k , the mass of this helium convection zone is almost constant at @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen abundance determined here for wd 0346@xmath0246  thus implies a total mass of hydrogen accreted of @xmath50 @xmath51 , and an accretion rate from the interstellar medium of @xmath52 @xmath51  yr@xmath53 ( or @xmath54 @xmath51  yr@xmath53 if we use the abundance value of oppenheimer et al . ) .",
    "such low accretion rates are of course completely unrealistic and would require extremely efficient screening mechanisms .",
    "for instance , the theoretical estimates of @xcite suggest time - averaged accretion rates of @xmath55 @xmath51   yr@xmath53 .",
    "similarly , the two - phase accretion model invoked by @xcite to account for the presence of metals in cool helium - rich white dwarfs assumes that accretion is most of the time small , typically @xmath56",
    "@xmath51  yr@xmath53 , but may proceed at a much higher rate of @xmath57 @xmath51  yr@xmath53 during passages through dense interstellar clouds .",
    "the extreme purity of the atmosphere suggested for wd 0346@xmath0246  also represents a problem if the presence of metals is considered .",

    "model atmospheres have been calculated by including metals in the equation - of - state only ; metallic opacities , which are negligible at the abundances and temperatures considered here , are not taken into account .",
    "the main effect of the presence of heavy elements is to provide free electrons , and to increase the contribution of the he@xmath58 free - free opacity  the dominant opacity source in pure helium models . here",
    "we include only one heavy element , calcium , the most common metal observed in dz stars .",
    "calcium abundances determined in dz stars are typically @xmath59 , although abundances as high as @xmath60 have also been observed in some objects @xcite . since calcium lines are not observed in the spectrum of wd 0346@xmath0246 , we consider calcium abundances much lower than those determined in typical dz stars .",
    "the results of our calculations for white dwarf models with @xmath13  k , @xmath33 , @xmath44 , and for @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 are displayed in figure [ fg : f3 ] , together with the photometric observations of wd 0346@xmath0246  shown for comparison .",
    "this experiment shows that even with a low calcium abundance of only @xmath65 , the infrared fluxes are significantly different from those obtained with the zero - metallicity model , and different from the observed fluxes of wd 0346@xmath0246  as well .",
    "higher calcium abundances  and the inclusion of additional elements such as magnesium or iron  would probably make matters even worse .",
    "we thus conclude that an almost pure helium atmospheric composition for wd 0346@xmath0246 , or any cool white dwarf in this temperature range for that matter , represents an unlikely solution . in the following sections , we propose an alternate solution for this object .",
    "@xcite showed that the photometric observations of da ( hydrogen - line ) white dwarfs in the ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) two - color diagram are well reproduced by pure hydrogen models down to @xmath21  k , below which the observed sequence seems to be better reproduced by the pure helium models ( see their fig .",
    ". a closer examination of the fits to the energy distributions of the cooler da stars revealed that a missing opacity source near the @xmath66 filter , resulting in an excess of flux in this region , was responsible for this discrepancy . when only wavelengths longward of @xmath66 were considered , such as in ( @xmath24 , @xmath26 ) diagrams ( see fig .",
    "13 of @xcite and fig .  9 of @xcite )",
    ", the pure hydrogen models followed perfectly the observed da sequence .",
    "for this reason , the @xmath66 magnitude was excluded in the fits of the hydrogen - rich stars cooler than @xmath67  k.    @xcite proposed that this missing opacity source in the pure hydrogen models could be due to the bound - free opacity associated with the so - called dissolved atomic levels of the hydrogen atom , or pseudo - continuum opacity . when an electron makes a bound - bound transition from a lower level to an upper level , there is a finite probability that this upper level will be sufficiently perturbed by surrounding particles ( a _ dissolved _ level ) such that the electron is no longer bound to the nucleus , leading instead to a bound - free transition .",
    "this pseudo - continuum opacity can be treated within the hummer - mihalas formalism following the work of @xcite and @xcite , which we briefly describe for completeness .",
    "the contribution of level @xmath68 to the total monochromatic opacity is given in lte by    @xmath69 ( 1-e^{-h\\nu /kt } ) , \\eqno ( 1)\\ ] ]    where the first term corresponds to the bound - bound opacities weighted by the occupation probability of each level of the transition .",
    "the occupation probability @xmath70 of the atomic level @xmath68 corresponds to the probability that an electron in this particular state is bound to the atom relative to a similar atomic state in a non - interacting environment .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath71 is the probability that this state belongs to the continuum due to interactions with neighboring charged and neutral particles  the so - called dissolved levels .",
    "the second term in equation ( 1 ) corresponds to the pseudo - continuum opacity , where @xmath72 is the photoionization cross - section from level @xmath68 , and @xmath73 is the _ dissolved fraction _ of levels given by the expression    @xmath74    where @xmath75 corresponds to the effective quantum number of the atomic level reached after the absorption of a photon of energy @xmath76 , i.e. ,    @xmath77    the atomic level @xmath75 is of course fictitious unless @xmath75 has an integer value .",
    "an occupation probability @xmath78 is assigned to that fictitious level by interpolating the value from the occupation probability of the real atomic levels .",
    "when @xmath75 is negative ( @xmath79 ) , we define @xmath80 ( i.e. , @xmath81 ) , and the transition becomes a true bound - free transition . for positive values of @xmath75",
    ", @xmath73 decreases with increasing wavelength , and the product of this term with the photoionization cross - section @xmath72  which is simply extrapolated below the frequency threshold  yields a pseudo - continuum opacity that gradually fades away from the unperturbed bound - free threshold .",
    "the pseudo - continuum opacity for the balmer jump in typical white dwarf atmosphere conditions is illustrated in figures 9 and 10 of @xcite .",
    "a problem arises if one considers the pseudo - continuum opacity originating from the lyman edge .",
    "for instance , near 4000  , the dissolved fraction at the photosphere of a cool ( @xmath82  k ) , hydrogen - rich white dwarf is typically @xmath83 .",
    "that is , electrons in the ground level of hydrogen making a corresponding transition to the fictitious level @xmath84 ( setting @xmath85 and @xmath86   in equation [ 3 ] ) have only a small 0.01% probability of going into the continuum , and to contribute to the bound - free opacity .",
    "however , since the pseudo - continuum opacity also depends on the population of hydrogen in the ground state , which is typically @xmath87 under such conditions , it remains the dominant opacity source , even in the infrared !",
    "the problem is illustrated more quantitatively in figure [ fg : f4 ] where the contributions of the most relevant sources of opacity in a cool hydrogen - rich atmosphere are shown .",
    "the pseudo - continuum opacity from the @xmath88 level shows the expected behavior : the bound - free cross section with an unperturbed threshold at 3644   is extended towards longer wavelength , and is gradually attenuated by the dissolved fraction factor ( see also fig .  2 of * ? ? ?",
    "the behavior shown by the pseudo - continuum opacity from the @xmath89 level ( dotted line ) is obviously unphysical , however .",
    "the results would imply that this continuum opacity dominate all other sources of opacity at all wavelengths !",
    "this is a familiar problem for those who have attempted to implement the occupation probability formalism of hummer - mihalas in white dwarfs cooler than @xmath90  k , where most of the hydrogen lies in the ground state . to overcome this problem ,",
    "an arbitrary cutoff is usually applied , or the pseudo - continuum opacity from the lyman edge is omitted altogether .    the exact reason why the hummer - mihalas formalism breaks down in this particular situation is not known , and a detailed analysis of this problem is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "we simply mention , as discussed in @xcite , that far away from the lyman jump , the calculation of the fraction of dissolved levels is probably unreliable .",
    "indeed , @xmath73 is proportional to the difference between the occupation probability of the ground level and that of the upper ( fictitious ) dissolved level which , away from the edge , is located slightly above the ground level . as such , @xmath91 only _ approaches _ zero and its exact value is meaningless , and so is the value of the corresponding pseudo - continuum opacity .",
    "the fact nevertheless remains that some form of pseudo - continuum opacity from the lyman edge must exist in nature .",
    "this led @xcite to suggest that perhaps this neglected opacity could be responsible for the observed discrepancy at the blue end of the energy distribution of cool hydrogen - rich white dwarfs .",
    "after all , the ratio of the threshold opacity for the @xmath89 level is more than 9 orders of magnitude larger than that of the @xmath88 level , and it is not too farfetched to expect some of this pseudo - continuum opacity to affect the optical regions of the energy distribution .    despite the lack of an accurate theory for calculating the fraction of dissolved levels far away from the lyman edge , we may still make a suitable approximation by including a `` damping '' function into the pseudo - continuum opacity .",
    "here we apply a damping function of the form    @xmath92    where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are arbitrary damping factors that remain to be determined .",
    "the results of the calculations with @xmath95 and @xmath96   are shown in figure [ fg : f4 ] .",
    "this particular choice remains of course completely arbitrary but includes the two desired features , i.e.  sufficient damping so that the overall energy distribution is still dominated by h@xmath58 in the optical and by h@xmath15  cia in the infrared ( not seen in fig .",
    "[ fg : f4 ] ) , and not too much damping so that the pseudo - continuum opacity contributes to the total opacity near the blue end of the optical region .",

    "however , the flux is considerably reduced near the @xmath66 bandpass , and models that include the pseudo - continuum opacity reproduce the observed @xmath66 magnitude quite well , as opposed to the model fluxes where this opacity is neglected .",
    "models were also calculated for mixed hydrogen and helium compositions in the temperature range of wd 0346@xmath0246 .",
    "the pseudo - continuum opacity is more important in this object than in the other two da white dwarfs discussed above , not only because of its lower effective temperature , but mainly because of the increased atmospheric pressure resulting from the presence of helium . for this particular experiment , it was thus necessary to include self - consistently the pseudo - continuum opacity in the calculations of the model structures .",

    "alternatively , wd 0346@xmath0246  may have evolved from a thin hydrogen layer da star that has been convectively mixed below @xmath118  k. according to figure 40 of @xcite , the minimum helium - to - hydrogen abundance ratio that can be achieved for a 0.8 @xmath51  white dwarf is when the hydrogen atmosphere with a mass of @xmath119 @xmath51  is convectively mixed at @xmath21  k. this yields an abundance of @xmath120 .",
    "hence , to arrive at an abundance of @xmath115 by the time the star has cooled down to @xmath121  k , it must accrete an extra @xmath122 @xmath51  of hydrogen over a period of @xmath123 gyr ( assuming here thin hydrogen models ) , which corresponds to an accretion rate of @xmath55 @xmath51  yr@xmath53 .",
    "hence it is not possible from these arguments alone to determine whether wd 0346@xmath0246  has evolved from a thin hydrogen - layer da white dwarf , or from a hot db star .",
    "we also discussed the fact that the extreme helium - rich composition solution for wd 0346@xmath0246  was unlikely because of the effects the presence of even small amounts of elements heavier than helium have on the predicted fluxes ( see fig . [ fg : f3 ] ) .",
    "our solutions presented in figures [ fg : f5 ] or [ fg : f6 ] are not sensitive to the presence of these additional elements since hydrogen remains the most important contributor of free electrons .",
    "additional calculations not shown here indicate that the emergent fluxes are not affected even when the calcium abundance is set to a value as high as @xmath124 .",
    "our solution is thus robust against the presence of such additional elements .",
    "in this paper we have reexamined the atmospheric parameters of the halo white dwarf wd 0346@xmath0246 .",
    "a solution at @xmath125  k with an extremely low hydrogen abundance has been found , @xmath126 , in agreement with the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "we have showed , however , that such a low hydrogen content is very unlikely due to accretion from the interstellar medium over a cooling age of roughly 10 gyr .",
    "furthermore , this solution was shown to be extremely volatile when even minute amounts of heavy elements were included in the atmosphere .",
    "we have proposed instead a solution where hydrogen and helium are present in the atmosphere of wd 0346@xmath0246  in nearly equal amounts .",
    "a good fit has been achieved by including a pseudo - continuum opacity originating from the dissolved levels of hydrogen .",
    "this opacity has been parameterized with an _ ad hoc _ damping function , however , and it is clear that a better physical description must be sought before more quantitative results can be achieved .    the presence of this missing opacity source had already been foreseen in the study of cool hydrogen - rich white dwarfs by @xcite who refrained from interpreting two - color diagrams where one of the filters may be affected by this missing opacity , no matter what its origin might be  ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) diagrams for instance .",
    "these studies have also shown that for the coolest ( @xmath8  k ) hydrogen - rich stars , even the @xmath100 filter may be affected .",
    "the results presented in this paper also support this conclusion ( see fig .",
    "[ fg : f5 ] ) .",
    "it thus appears extremely dangerous to interpret these newly discovered ultracool white dwarfs in two - color or color magnitude diagrams which involve `` blue '' magnitudes ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) until this problem with the missing opacity has been properly dealt with , and included in the theoretical models and colors .",
    "it now remains to be seen whether this new opacity source , even when included with the approximate treatment introduced in this paper , can help resolve the mystery surrounding several ultracool white dwarfs whose energy distributions have yet failed to be successfully explained in terms of hydrogen or mixed hydrogen / helium compositions .",
    "we are grateful to s.  t.  hodgkin for providing us with the spectrum of wd 0346@xmath0246 , and to g.  fontaine and f.  wesemael for a careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "this work was supported in part by the nserc canada and by the fund fcar ( qubec ) ."
