    "protoplanetary disks evolve through a variety of physical processes . early in its evolution ,",
    "a massive gas - rich disk loses mass through accretion onto the star , outflows , and photevaporation by high - energy photons ( gorti et al . 2009 ) . at the same time , grains grow into larger bodies that settle onto the mid - plane of the disk where they can grow into rocks , planetesimals , and beyond .",
    "dust settling steepens the slope of the mid- and far - infrared ( ir ) spectral energy distribution ( sed ) because a smaller fraction of the stellar radiation is intercepted by circumstellar dust ( dullemond @xmath1 dominik , 2004 ) .",
    "also , since grain growth is expected to proceed faster in the inner disk , it could result in an inner opacity hole ( dullemond @xmath1 dominik , 2005 ) .",
    "as the disk mass and accretion rate decrease , chromospheric extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) photons start to penetrate the inner disk and euv - induced photoevaporation becomes important .",
    "when the accretion rate drops below the photoevaporation rate , the outer disk is no longer able to resupply the inner disk with material . at this point ,",
    "the inner disk drains on a viscous timescale ( @xmath010@xmath2 yr ) and an inner hole is formed ( alexander et al . 2006 ) .",
    "once this inner hole has formed , the euv photons can reach the inner edge of the disk unimpeded , preventing any material from the outer disk from flowing into the inner hole .",
    "this halts accretion and results on the rapid transition between the classical t tauri star ( ctts ) and the weak - line t tauri star ( wtts ) stage .",
    "the disk then quickly photoevaporates from the inside out .",
    "once the remaining gas photoevaporates , the small grains are removed by radiation pressure and poynting - robertson drag .",
    "what is left constitutes the initial conditions of a debris disk : a gas poor disk with large grains , planetesimals and/or planets .",
    "this evolutionary path is certainly not unique as some systems such as lkca 15 , dm tau , and gm aur seem to have developed sharp cavities due to the dynamical interactions with close ( sub)stellar companions or recently formed giant planets while their outer disks are still quite massive ( najita et al . 2007 ) .",
    "even though the broadest aspects of disk evolution summarized above are relatively well established ( see williams @xmath1 cieza , 2011 for a recent review on protoplanetary disks and their evolution ) , we are still far from developing a comprehensive disk evolution theory , for which additional observational constraints are much needed .",
    "the so - called  transition \" objects ( broadly defined as disks with inner opacity holes ) are particularly useful _ disk evolution laboratories _ as they are the systems where the key physical processes mentioned above have the clearest observational signatures .",
    "this is so simply because grain growth , photevaporation , and dynamical clearing all result in reduced levels of near- and/or mid - ir excess emission , which is the defining feature of transition objects .",
    "this paper is the third part of a series from an ongoing project aiming to characterize @xmath0100 _ spitzer_-selected transition disks located in nearby star - forming regions .",
    "this coordinated project has two main goals : 1 ) provide observational constraints on the evolution of primordial disks , their dissipation , and the primordial to debris disk transition , and 2 ) identify systems with strong evidence for ongoing giant planet formation so they can eventually be used as _",
    "planet formation laboratories_. in the first paper of the series ( cieza et al . 2010 ; paper i hereafter ) , we studied a sample of 26 ophiuchus transition disks , while in the second paper ( romero et al .",
    "2012 , apj , in press ; paper ii hereafter ) we analyzed a sample of 17 objects from the lupus , corona australis , and scorpius regions . in papers",
    "i and ii , we showed that transition disks are a very heterogenous group of objects with disk masses ranging from @xmath3  0.6 m@xmath4 to 40 m@xmath4 , accretion rates ranging from @xmath3  10@xmath5 to 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 , and fractional disk luminosities , l@xmath8/l@xmath9 , ranging from a few percent to @xmath10  10@xmath11 .",
    "we also showed that their diverse properties can be understood in terms of different disk evolution processes and distinct evolutionary stages .    here we present millimeter wavelength photometry ( from the submillimeter array and jcmt ) , high - resolution optical spectroscopy ( from the canada - franca - hawaii telescope ) , and adaptive optics near - infrared imaging ( from the gemini telscope ) for other 31 _ spitzer_-selected transition circumstellar disks located in the perseus , taurus , and auriga molecular clouds .",
    "as in our previous studies , we use these new ground - based data to estimate disk masses , accretion rates , and multiplicity for our sample in order to investigate the mechanisms potentially responsible for their inner opacity holes .",
    "these new 31 objects take our total sample of well characterized transition disks to 74 .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "our sample selection criteria are presented in section  2 , while our observations and data reduction techniques are described in section  3 .",
    "we present our results on disk masses , accretion rates , and multiplicity in section  4 . in section  5 ,",
    "we discuss the likely origins of the inner holes of the 31 new individual targets and discuss the properties of our combined sample of 74 transition objects in a broader context of disk evolution .",
    "finally , a summary of our results and conclusions is presented in section  6 .",
    "we drew our sample from the _ spitzer _ catalogs of 3 northern clouds mapped by 3 different legacy programs : _ cores to disks _ ( perseus molecular cloud ) , _ taurus _ ( taurus molecular cloud ) , and _",
    "gould s belt _ ( auriga molecular cloud ) . for a description of the _ cores to disks _ data products , see evans et al.del@xmath12document.pdf ] .",
    "the _ taurus _",
    "catalogs are discussed by padgett et al .. a the time of this writing , the _ gould s belt _ data products have not yet been delivered to nasa s infra - red science archive ( irsa ) , but they should also eventually become publicly available through irsa .",
    "as in papers i and ii , we selected all the targets meeting the following criteria :    _ a. _ have _ spitzer _ colors [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] @xmath3 0.25 .",
    "these are objects with small or no near - ir excess ( see figure  [ f : sample_sel ] ) .",
    "the lack of a [ 3.6 ] - [ 4.5 ] color excess in our targets is inconsistent with an optically thick disk extending inward to the dust sublimation radius , and therefore implies the presence of an inner opacity hole .",
    "the presence of this inner opacity hole is the defining feature we intend to capture in our sample .    _",
    "b. _ have _ spitzer _ colors [ 3.6]-[24 ] @xmath13 1.5 .",
    "we apply this criterion to ensure that all our targets have very significant 24 @xmath14 m excesses ( @xmath135 - 10 @xmath15 ) , unambiguously indicating the presence of circumstellar material .",
    "the exact color cut is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "we have empirically found that most ysoc with low 24 @xmath14 m excesses ( [ 3.6]-[24 ] @xmath10 1.5 ) are in fact background agb stars ( see paper ii ) .    _",
    "c. _ are detected with a signal to noise ratio @xmath13 7 in all 2mass and irac wavelengths as well as at 24 @xmath14 m , to ensure that we only include targets with very reliable photometry .    _",

    "the first two selection criteria ( [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] @xmath3 0.25 and [ 3.6]-[24 ] @xmath13 1.5 ) effectively become our working definition for a transition disk .",
    "these criteria are fairly inclusive and encompass most of the transition disk definitions found in the literature as they select disks with a significant flux decrement relative to  normal disks \" in the near - ir or at all wavelengths . in particular",
    ", our definition includes objects with falling mid - ir seds such as anemic ( lada et al .",
    "2006 ) or homologously depleted transition disks ( currie et la .",
    "2009 ) as well as objects with rising mid - ir seds such as classical transition disks ( muzerolle et al .",
    "2010 ) or cold disks ( brown et al . 2007 ; merin et al .",
    "the one type of transition disk that is likely to be under - represented in our sample is the so - called  pre - transitional \" disk category , which describes systems with optically thin gaps separating optically thick inner and outer disk components ( espaillat et al .",
    "these rare objects tend to have large near - ir excesses that could be excluded by our [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] @xmath3 0.25 criterion . for a concise description of the complex transition disk nomenclature , see evans et al .",
    "we find 41 targets that meet all of our selection criteria : 18 objects in perseus ( @xmath044@xmath17 ) , 6 in auriga ( @xmath015@xmath17 ) , and 17 in taurus ( @xmath041@xmath17 ) .",
    "we have observed all 41 objects in our target list ; however , as discussed in section  [ pms_id ] , this list includes 6 asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and 4 likely debris disks around main - sequence ( ms ) stars .",

    "similarly , the parent sample of our taurus objects has been discussed by rebull et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and luhman et al .",
    "we note that while rebull et al . only used the catalogs from the taurus legacy program as we do , the study by luhman et al .",
    "includes many additional observations of the taurus region from several general observer and guaranteed time observations programs .",

    "we used the natural guide star mode for the targets brighter than r = 15.5 mag , and the laser guide star mode for the objects fainter than r=15.5 mag . in all cases ,",

    "six objects remain unobserved at ( sub)millimeter wavelengths . however , since our ( sub)millimeter observing programs gave the lowest priority to objects with little 24 @xmath14 m excesses and/or lacking accretion signatures , these 6 unobserved targets turned out to be either an asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars contaminating our sample ( 1 object ) or a debris disk candidate ( 5 objects ; see section  [ pms_id ] ) .",

    "background galaxies are the main source of contamination .",
    "however , the optical and near - ir flux cuts we have implemented as part of our sample selection criteria are very efficient at removing extragalactic sources from the _ spitzer _ catalogs . at the bright end of the flux distribution , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars are the main source of contamination .",
    "agb stars are surrounded by shells of dust and thus have small , but detectable , ir excesses .",

    "circumstellar disks are initially very flared and intersect a significant fraction of the stellar radiation , most of which is reprocessed and reemitted at ir wavelengths . as dust grains coagulate and",
    "grow in the disk , they fall toward the mid - plane , where the surface density is higher and they can grow at a higher rate and settle even deeper into the disk . as a result , the disk becomes geometrically flatter with time , which reduces the fraction of stellar radiation intercepted by the disk and steepens the slope of the sed at mid - ir wavelengths ( dalessio et al . 2006 ; dullemond et al .",
    "grain growth is expected to proceed faster in the inner disk , where the surface densities are higher and the dynamical timescales are shorter .",

    "normal \" seds may contain one or more protoplanets that are not yet massive enough to open a wide hole in the disk , and as mentioned in section  2 , we are likely to miss pre - transition disks , with wide gaps but significant near - ir excess . we thus conclude that the giant planet disk candidates identified in our survey are likely to represent only a subsample of the entire population of disks actively forming planets in the molecular clouds we are considering . this subsample may be dominated by systems with multiple and/or very massive planets .",
    "dynamical clearing by stellar companions has been one of the main mechanisms proposed to explain the inner holes of transition disks .",
    "however , in section  [ classification ] we only found one circumbinary disk candidate in our sample of 31 transition disks .",
    "a low incidence of circumbinary disk candidates was also found in papers i and ii .",
    "the combined sample of 74 transition disks now allow us to derive more robust conclusions on the role multiplicity plays on transition disk systems . as in paper",
    "i , we compare the distribution of binary separations of our sample of transition disk to that of non - transition disk and disk - less pms stars .",
    "we draw our sample of non - transition disks ( objects with  normal \" levels of near - ir excess ) and disk - less pms stars from the compilation of multiplicity and _ spitzer _ data ( for disk identification ) presented by cieza et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for over 300 pms stars in the taurus , chameleon i , ophiuchus , and corona australis regions .",
    "as seen in figure  [ f : multi_fig ] , disk - less pms stars tend to have companions at smaller separations than stars with regular , non - transition disks . according to a two - sided kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov ( ks ) test , there is less than a 10@xmath11 probability that the distributions of binary separations of non - transition disks and disk - less stars have been drawn from the same parent population .",
    "this result can be understood in terms of the effect tidal truncation has on the lifetimes of the circumstellar disks of the individual components of the binary system ( cieza et al .",
    "2009 ; kraus et al .",
    "2011 ) . a binary system at the peak of the separation distribution ( @xmath030 au ) , is expected to initially have individual disks that are @xmath010 - 15 au in radius .",
    "given that the viscous timescale is roughly proportional to the size of the disk , such small disks are likely to have accretion lifetimes smaller than the age of the sample and hence they now appear as young disk - less stars .",
    "in very tight binary systems , the outer disk can survive in the form of a circumbinary disk , with a tidally truncated inner hole with a radius @xmath02@xmath19 the orbital separation ( artymowicz @xmath1 lubow , 1994 ) .",
    "if such close systems were a significant component of the transition disk population , one would expect to find a higher incidence of close binaries in transition disks that in non - transition disks . while our multiplicity census is clearly very incomplete at small separations",
    ", our ao observations should be sensitive to an over abundance of companions in the 10 to 30 au range that could in principle be responsible for many of the inner holes of our transition disks .",
    "however , we find that only @xmath04@xmath17 ( 3/74 ) of our transition disks have companions in this separation range .",
    "near - ir interferometry ( pott et al . 2010 ) and aperture masking observations ( kraus et al .",
    "2009 ) also suggest that the incidence of tight _ stellar _ companions is rather low in transition objects .",
    "we thus conclude that tight stellar companions tend to destroy each other s disk rather quickly .",
    "few close binary systems retain circumbinary disks with transition disk seds ( e.g. , coku tau/4 and fw tau ) .",
    "while it is increasingly clear that photoevaporation by the central star plays a fundamental role on the evolution and dissipation of protoplanetary disks , the heating mechanisms and magnitudes of the photoevaporation rates are still a matter of intense debate .",
    "in particular , the relative importance of far - uv ( fuv ) , extreme - uv ( euv ) , and x - ray photoevaporation is not well understood .",
    "all photoevaporation models predict the formation of an inner hole and subsequent inside - out dissipation once mass transport across the disk falls below the photoevaporation rate ; however , they strongly disagree on the mass a disk should have at the time the inner hole is formed .",
    "euv - driven photoevaporation models ( alexander et al .",
    "2006 ) predict low evaporation rates , of the order of 10@xmath55 m@xmath27/yr . as a result , the inner hole forms late on the evolution the disk , when most of the mass has been depleted ( disk mass @xmath10 1 m@xmath4 ) and the accretion rate onto the star has dropped below the 10@xmath55 m@xmath27/yr level .",
    "more recent euv+x - ray and fuv+x - ray photoevaporation models ( gorti et al . 2009 ; owen et al . 2011 ) predict much higher evaporation rates ( 10@xmath5610@xmath57 m@xmath27/yr ) and an earlier formation for the inner hole , when disk masses are @xmath24  5 m@xmath4 .",
    "these later models allow the presence of accretion in disks with inner holes that have formed through photoevaporation because the accretion rates from the draining of the inner disk become detectable for significant period of time .",
    "however , once the inner disk is drained , accretion must stop as material from the _ outer _ disk can not overcome the photoevaporation front .",
    "x - ray photevaporation models thus predict a population of non - accreing objects ( i.e. , wttss ) with relatively massive outer disks ( @xmath24  5  m@xmath4 ) .    in paper ii , we demonstrated the lack of massive outer disk around low - mass wttss , which contradicts the predictions of photoevaporating models with high accretion rates .",
    "this result stills holds for the new low - mass stars studied herein and seems to extend to higher mass objects .",
    "figure  [ f : mass_vs_spt ] shows the disk masses derived for our combined sample of transition disks .",
    "there is only one ( sub)millimeter detection at 0.4 m@xmath4 for non - accreting objects ( corresponding to fw tau ) , the rest are upper limits in the @xmath00.5 to @xmath05 m@xmath4 range . since fw tau is a circumbinary disk , there is not guarantee that its inner hole is due to photoevaporation .",
    "the sample now includes several non - accreting kgfab stars observed at millimeter wavelengths , but increasing the sample size for this type of objects is clearly desirable .",
    "an important caveat to figure  [ f : mass_vs_spt ] is the inherent uncertainty of deriving disk masses from ( sub)millimeter photometry , which requires strong assumptions on dust opacities and gas to dust mass ratios ( williams @xmath1 cieza , 2011 ) .",
    "if those assumptions are incorrect , they could lead to systematic errors in the determination of disk masses .",
    "however , the observed accretion rates of pms stars provide independent observational constraints that also favor photoevaporations rates significantly lower than 10@xmath57 m@xmath27/yr .",
    "if photoevaporation rates are @xmath010@xmath57 m@xmath27/yr , then it becomes difficult to explain all the cttss without inner holes that have accretion rates less than @xmath010@xmath57 m@xmath27/yr ( hartmann et al .",
    "overall , the observational evidence suggests that photoevaporation rates must be small ( @xmath010@xmath55 m@xmath27yr@xmath53 ) and that the phoptoevaporation front can only overcome accretion when disk masses have fallen below @xmath10  1  m@xmath4 .",
    "while the samples in papers i and ii were strongly dominated by m - type stars , our current combined sample does contain a significant number of higher mass kgfab - type stars .",
    "these allow us to investigate whether the incidence of the disk clearing mechanisms depend on stellar mass or luminosity .",
    "figure  [ f : hrd_types ] shows the same h - r diagram as in figure  [ f : hrd ] , but now indicating the location of each type of disk .",
    "the most striking feature of the diagram is that all 9 pms stars hotter than @xmath010@xmath58 ( 5754 k , corresponding to a g5 star ) have non - accreting disks , either photoevaporating disks or debris disks .",
    "this is in agreement with the results from _",
    "spitzer _ studies of young stellar clusters and associations showing that primordial disks dissipate faster around higher mass stars ( carpenter et al .",
    "2006 ; dahm @xmath1 hillenbrand , 2007 ) .",
    "the 4 ms stars with debris disks are also hot baf - type stars .",
    "this can be understood considering that debris disks are easier to detect at mid - ir wavelengths around more luminous objects ( e.g. , rieke et al .",
    "2005 ; hernandez et al .",
    "2006 ; cieza et al .",
    "table  4 shows the occurrence of different types of transition disks for m - type ( 48 objects ) , k - type ( 17 objects ) and gfab - type stars ( 9 objects ) in our combined sample . since m - type stars are fainter and cooler than higher mass stars , they may present weaker near- and/or mid - ir excesses even without grain growth and dust settling effects ( ercolano , clarke @xmath1 robitaille , 2009 ) .",
    "however , the fact that we see a _ lower _ fraction of grain - growth dominated disk candidates around m - type stars than around k - type stars , suggests that we are not significantly overestimating the fraction of m - type stars in this category .",
    "detailed modeling of individual objects are still needed to confirm the nature of some of these grain - growth dominated disks , especially the ones around very late m - type stars with modest decrements of ir emission .",
    "however , it is clear that grain - growth and dust settling play a fundamental role on the evolution of cicumstellar disks",
    ". the grain - growth dominated disk category accounts for @xmath2440@xmath17 of all disks around both the m - type stars and k - type stars in our sample .",
    "currie @xmath1 sicilia - aguilar ( 2011 ) recently showed that the percentage of disks in the transition phase increases significantly between @xmath01 to @xmath08 myr . the h - r diagram in figure  [ f : hrd_types ] , showing our combined sample , now allows us to investigate how the incidence of different transition disk _ types _ evolve with age .",
    "while the stellar ages of individual targets are highly uncertain , the age distribution of each disk category should carry more meaningful information .",
    "table  5 shows the occurrence of different types of transition disks for objects falling above the 1 myr isochrone ( 14 targets ) , between the 1 and 3 myr isochrones ( 30 objects ) , and below the 3 myr isochrone ( 30 objects , _ not _ including the 4 ms star candidates ) in our combined sample . even with our relatively small sample , we find that the incidence of photoevaporating disks and debris disks increases with age , while the fraction of grain - growth dominated disks decreases with time .",
    "these trends are in agreement with the overall evolution of typical protoplanetary disks ( williams @xmath1 cieza , 2011 ) .",
    "interestingly , the occurrence of plant - forming disks candidates peaks in the 1 - 3 myr old age bin and is @xmath00@xmath17 for objects above the 1 myr age isochrone . the lack of planet - forming disks with ages @xmath10 1 myr is suggestive , especially considering that the intrinsic age distribution of these objects is most likely to be narrower than that seen in the h - r diagram , where some of the scatter can be attributed to the observational uncertainties in t@xmath59 and luminosity .",
    "if taken at face at value , these results would imply that _ 1 ) _ the inferred giant planets have formed through core - accretion ( lissauer , 1993 ) as gravitational instability models ( boss , 2000 ) favor a younger age distribution , and _ 2 ) _ core accretion takes 2 to 3 myr to form giant planets massive enough to open a gap in the disk .",
    "while important caveats remain ( we are dealing with planet - forming disk _ candidates _ , the sample is relatively small , and stellar ages are highly uncertain and model dependent ) , these results are promising . in the near future ,",
    "detailed age analyses of larger samples of transition disks with increasingly clear planet - formation signatures are likely to provide strong astrophysical constraints on planet - formation timescales .",
    "as part of an ongoing program aiming to characterize a large number of _ spitzer_-selected transition disks , we have obtained millimeter wavelength photometry , high - resolution optical spectroscopy and adaptive optics near - infrared imaging for a sample of 31 transition objects located in the perseus , taurus , and auriga molecular clouds .",
    "we use these ground - based data to estimate disk masses , multiplicity , and accretion rates in order to investigate the mechanisms potentially responsible for their inner holes .",
    "we combined disk masses , accretion rates , and multiplicity data with other information , such as sed morphology and fractional disk luminosity to classify the disks as _",
    "strong candidates _ for the following categories : grain - growth dominates disks ( 7 objects ) , giant planet - forming disks ( 6 objects ) , photoevaporating disks ( 7 objects ) , debris disks ( 11 obecjts ) , and cicumbinary disks ( 1 object , which was also classified as photoevaporating disk ) .",
    "each category represents an educated guess , giving all the available data , on the evolutionary status of the disk or the physical process mainly responsible for the reduced levels of near - ir and/or mid - ir excesses characteristic of the objects in our sample .",
    "the boundaries between the categories are of course not perfectly defined .",
    "for instance , all primordial disks are expected to simultaneously undergo some degree of grain growth , dust settling , and photoevaporation .",
    "similarly , our criterion to distinguish primordial photoevaporating disks from debris disks is based on l@xmath8/l@xmath9 instead of on the gas content of their outer disks , which still remains highly unconstrained .",
    "the gas dissipation of the outer disk through photoevaporation is believed to mark the rapid transition from the primordial to the debris disk stage ( williams @xmath1 cieza , 2011 ) .",
    "conclusively establishing the nature of each target will thus require detail modeling and followup observations .",
    "even with the above caveats , the properties of transition disks can provide important clues on different aspects of disk evolution . combining our sample of 31 transition disks with those from papers i and ii results in a sample of 74 transition disk objects that have been selected , characterized , and classified in an homogenous way .",
    "the main conclusions derived from the analysis of this combined high - quality sample can be summarized as follows :    \\1 ) circumstellar disks with reduced levels of near - ir and/or mid - ir excesses in nearby molecular clouds represent a very heterogenous group of objects with a wide range of sed morphologies , disk masses , accretion rates , and fractional disk luminosities .",
    "this diversity points toward distinct evolutionary stages and physical processes driving the evolution of each disk .",
    "\\2 ) the incidence of objects with signatures of dynamical clearing by recently formed giant planets is significantly lower than the occurrence of giant planets within 20 au of mature solar - type stars ( @xmath05@xmath17 vs @xmath020@xmath17 ) .",
    "the giant planet disk candidates identified in our survey are likely to represent special cases , where multiple massive planets may be present .",
    "\\3 ) the incidence of circumbinary disk candidates in our sample of transition objects is low ( @xmath10 10@xmath17 ) implying that tight _ stellar _ companions tend to erode each other s disk rather quickly .",
    "\\4 ) there is a lack of massive disks around non - accreting stars of a wide range of spectral types , which contradicts the predictions of recent photoevaporation models that find very high evaporation rates ( @xmath010@xmath57 m@xmath27yr@xmath53 ) .",
    "our results suggest that photoevaporation rates must be small ( @xmath010@xmath55 m@xmath27yr@xmath53 ) and that the photoevaporation front can only overcome accretion when disk masses have fallen below @xmath10 1 m@xmath4 .",
    "5 ) debris disks and photoevaporating disk candidates are more common around hotter stars , consistent with the idea that primordial disks dissipate faster around more massive objects .",
    "\\6 ) grain growth - dominated disks account for @xmath2440@xmath17 of our sample of transition disks around k and m - type stars , confirming that grain - growth and dust settling play a major role on the evolution of primordial circumstellar disks .",
    "\\7 ) we find a trend in the sense that the incidence of photoevaporating disks and debris disks increases with age , while the fraction of grain - growth dominated disks decreases with time , which is consistent with disk evolution models .",
    "\\8 ) a preliminary analysis of the age distribution of disks with signatures of dynamical clearing by recently formed giant planets reveals a lack of such objects among the youngest stars in the sample .",
    "this favors core accretion as the main planet formation mechanism and a 2 to 3 myr formation timescale .",
    "transition objects are invaluable disk evolution and planet formation laboratories .",
    "detailed modeling and followup observations of different types of transition disks are highly desirable to further our understanding of key processes such as grain growth and dust settling , photoevaporation , dynamical clearing , and planet formation itself .",
