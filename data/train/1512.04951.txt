    "in flatter systems , the inner planet in a pair tends to have a smaller impact parameter , skewing the @xmath222 distribution to values greater than 1 .",
    "both the mutual inclinations and eccentricities affect the width of the @xmath222 distribution , but mutual inclination has a stronger effect because a small change in inclination has a strong effect on @xmath220 , whereas a small change in @xmath50 affects @xmath222 only modestly .",
    "the ensembles that produce the widest spacings ( represented by ed10@xmath145 in fig .",
    "[ fig : tranet ] ) also produce the largest period ratios , the lowest multiplicities , and the widest / least - skewed @xmath222 .",
    "they overproduce single tranets and underproduce high multiplicity systems .",
    "their spacing , period ratio , and @xmath222 distributions match the tails of the observed distributions but not the peak .",
    "the @xcite initial conditions also result in spacings , period ratios , and @xmath222 distributions that are too broad .",
    "in contrast , the ensembles that produce the tightest spacings ( exemplified by the intermediate damping ensemble , ed10@xmath143 , in fig .  [ fig : tranet ] ) match the peaks of the observed spacing and period ratio distributions but not the tails .",
    "they overproduce high multiplicity systems and underproduce single tranets .",
    "they produce a @xmath222 distribution that is too narrow and skewed .    rather than resembling a single one of our simulated ensembles , the observed distributions appear to comprise a mixture of ensembles .",
    "the simulated distributions from one ensemble can either match the peaks or tails of the observed distributions , but not both . in the right column of fig .",
    "[ fig : tranet ] , we combine the tranets from a tightly spaced , low mutual inclination ensemble ( ed@xmath157 ) with a widely spaced , larger mutual inclination ensemble ( ed@xmath147 ) . for the combined distribution , we use all the ed@xmath157 tranets and randomly draw 50% of the generated ed@xmath147 tranets ( where the 50% weighting is a free parameter that we chose to match the observations ) .",
    "the resulting mixed tranet population reproduces well both the peaks and tails of the observed @xmath12 , period ratio , and @xmath222 distributions , in addition to the relative occurrence rates of single and multiple tranets in the observed multiplicity distribution . what remains to be explained",
    "is the population of planets with the smallest period ratios @xmath111.5 and the tightest spacings @xmath223 .",
    "we speculate that these close neighbors may reflect orbital migration , either of super - earths or their progenitor cores .",
    "is a mixture of two populations truly necessary ?",
    "the ed@xmath147 ensemble is clearly a poor match to the observed distribution , but the improvement of the combined population over ed@xmath157 is less obvious . we perform some statistical tests to help decide this issue .",
    "a two - sample k - s test applied to the distribution of transit duration ratios ( fig .",
    "14 , row 4 ) leads us to reject the null hypothesis that the observed distribution and the ed@xmath157 distribution are drawn from the same distribution ( @xmath166-value 0.0004 ) ; at the same time , we can not reject the null hypothesis that the observed and combined - group period ratios are drawn from the same distribution ( @xmath166-value 0.02 ) . applying the k - s test to the period ratio distributions ( row 2 )",
    ", we reject the null hypothesis that the observed period ratios are drawn from any of the simulated distributions  if we consider the full range of period ratios .",
    "but if we restrict our attention to period ratios greater than that of the 3:2 resonance , we find that we can not reject the null hypothesis that the observed and combined - group period ratios are drawn from the same distribution ( @xmath166-value 0.06 ) , while still rejecting the null hypothesis that the observed period ratios and ed@xmath157 period ratios are drawn from the same distribution ( @xmath166-value 0.004 ) .",
    "when we apply the k - s test to the @xmath12 distributions ( row 1 ) , we reject the null hypothesis that the observed spacings are drawn from any of the simulated distributions ( ed@xmath147 , ed@xmath157 , or combined )  even if we make a cut for @xmath224 .",
    "finally , we consider the tranet multiplicity distribution ( row 3 ) , for which a k - s test is inappropriate because the distribution is spread across a small number of integers .",
    "if we assume poisson uncertainties and add them in quadrature , the observed ratios of tranet multiplicities are @xmath225 , and @xmath226 for 1:2 , 2:3 , 3:4 , 4:5 , and 5:6 tranet systems , respectively . in ed@xmath157 , these ratios are 2.5 , 3.6 , 1.7 , 2.6 , and 2.3 ( chi - squared of 27 ) , whereas for the mixture model , these ratios are 3.6 , 4.3 , 2.0 , 2.7 , and 2.3 ( chi - squared of 23 )",
    ". therefore the mixture model represents an improved match to the observations ; it matches the observed distribution well except that it overproduces two tranet systems relative to three tranet systems . in sum",
    ", the mixture model offers quantitative improvements for matching three out of the four observables in fig .",
    "the purpose of the k - s and chi - squared statistics computed here is to quantify the significance of features we see in the plots , such as a claimed difference between two distributions , or a putative improvement of a mixture model over a single ensemble .",
    "our aim is to ensure that the features discerned by eye are statistically significant and not due to chance and/or insufficient sample size .",
    "we caution that because of the simplifications in our simulations ( including their limited 30 myr timespan ) , these statistics should not be used to fine - tune our simulation parameters to match the observations .    when we extended the simulated timescale of the ed10@xmath143 ensemble from 30 myr to 180 myr , the distributions of tranet spacing , period ratio , and duration ratio remained just as different from the observed distributions , but the distribution of tranet multiplicities changed to provide a better match to the observed distribution .",
    "as discussed in section 5.2 , performing extended timescale simulations is an important next step for a detailed quantitative comparison to the observations .",
    "even if a single one of our ensembles could be made to adequately match the observations , our argument that the data support two modes of planet formation  reflecting gas - rich vs.  gas - poor environments  would still carry weight .",
    "the ensemble ed@xmath157 is itself a mixture model to a degree , since it contains simulations having a range of solid surface densities .",
    "core coagulation times are exponentially sensitive to solid surface density @xcite . for solid surface densities toward the upper end of the range in ed@xmath157 , cores coagulate sufficiently quickly that gas is still present at the end of coagulation . for solid surface densities toward the lower end of the range , cores coagulate more slowly , in environments drained of gas .",
    "the thesis of our paper is that the observations implicate two modes of core coagulation for super - earths : a gas - rich mode ( but not too gas - rich ; see @xcite and @xcite ) and a gas - poor mode .",
    "a mixture of two populations is consistent with the statistical study by @xcite of m - dwarf systems ; using a parametric mixture model for the distribution of tranets , they found evidence for two populations , one spawning single tranets and another of high tranet multiplicity .",
    "@xcite gave more weight to systems producing single tranets ( 1:1 ) than we do ( 0.5:1 ) .",
    "here we find that a mixture reproduces not only the multiplicity statistics but also the @xmath222 , @xmath12 , and period ratio distributions . in terms of the implications of our results for planet formation ,",
    "our mixture represents a set of planets that underwent most of their growth in the presence of some residual gas ( ed@xmath157 ) , plus another set that assembled after the gas disk had completely dissipated ( ed@xmath147 ; this ensemble could be replaced with one or more of the ed@xmath159 , ed@xmath156 , ed@xmath155 ensembles with different weightings ) .    among systems with two or more tranets ,",
    "the median eccentricity and inclination in ensemble ed@xmath157 are 0.02 and 0.7@xmath32 , respectively . without invoking tidal circularization ,",
    "the median eccentricity is in good agreement with the rayleigh parameter @xmath227 ( corresponding to a median @xmath228 ) measured by @xcite for planets with transit timing variations .",
    "furthermore , among our simulated pairs in ed@xmath157 with period ratios less than 2 , the median eccentricity is as small as @xmath229 .",
    "the ensemble ed@xmath157 is the one that we argued in section 6 should also produce the lowest density planets .",
    "in contrast , the ensembles that we argued should produce higher density planets have median tranet eccentricities of @xmath230 and inclinations of @xmath231 for ensembles @xmath232ed@xmath155 , ed@xmath156 , ed@xmath159 , ed@xmath233 , respectively . for period ratios less than 2 , the corresponding median eccentricities are @xmath234 @xmath235 .",
    "the lower eccentricities and lower bulk densities of the ed@xmath157 ensemble may account for the result of @xcite that larger planets ( @xmath12.54 @xmath236 ) having lower densities @xcite have smaller eccentricities than planets @xmath237 .",
    "another observational application of our simulations is to the finding of @xcite that planets with masses measured via transit timing variations ( ttvs , which necessarily involve tight orbital spacings ) have lower bulk densities than those measured via radial velocities ( which are easier to measure for more widely separated planets ; see also @xcite , and in particular @xcite for how selection effects based on mass may contribute to the result of @xcite ) . for the mixed ensemble plotted in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tranet ] , period ratios less than 2 ( i.e. , period ratios typical for ttv planets ) are dominated by planets in the ed@xmath157 ensemble , which are expected to have lower densities .",
    "furthermore , as described in section 6.1 , for a particular gas depletion factor and a range of solid surface densities , planets of a given mass having tighter spacings will also typically have lower densities .",
    "the circumstances of the giant impact era of planet formation link super - earths orbital properties to their compositions .",
    "two types of systems are established : dynamically hot ( widely spaced , eccentric , mutually inclined ) planets with high bulk densities , and dynamically cold ( tightly spaced , circular , flat ) planets with gas envelopes and low densities .",
    "our solar system s terrestrial planets fall into the former category .",
    "typical orbital properties for the latter category  hill spacings @xmath9 , @xmath238 , and @xmath239  are dynamically colder .",
    "the hill spacing is set by an eccentricity equilibrium between gravitational scatterings , which tend to increase @xmath50 , and mergers , which tend to damp it ( section 3 ) .",
    "this eccentricity equilibrium predicts that lower inclination systems end up with smaller hill spacings , a result that is confirmed numerically .    the two most important disk properties for determining the orbits and compositions of planets are the disk s solid surface density and its late - stage residual gas surface density ( section 6 ) .",
    "disks with higher solid surface density and moderate gas surface density ( depleted by a factor of @xmath1100 relative to the minimum - mass solar nebula ) tend to produce tightly spaced , low @xmath50 and @xmath36 , low density planets .",
    "higher solid surface density enables cores to form faster  fast enough for cores to accrete volumetrically significant atmospheres from residual gas before it dissipates completely ( section 6.1 ; see also @xcite who make the same point ) .",
    "a moderate late - stage gas surface density has enough dynamical friction to flatten the system  allowing for an eccentricity equilibrium to be achieved at tighter spacings ( section 3 )  but not so much that mergers up to the final core mass are prevented .",
    "higher gas surface densities prevent mergers , so cores grow only after the disk gas dissipates sufficiently .",
    "if gas surface densities are too low  and if the inner disk gas is not replenished ( see @xcite for a discussion of replenishment )  then planets fail to acquire significant atmospheres .",
    "hence a happy medium for the gas density is required to produce tightly spaced , low density planets .",
    "we found that we need a mixture of dynamically hot and dynamically cold systems to reproduce the observed hill spacings , period ratios , tranet multiplicities , and transit duration ratios of _ kepler  _ super - earths ( section 7 )",
    ". we can match the observed distributions with a combination of moderate and lower ( at the time of core assembly ) gas surface densities , in concert with a range of solid surface densities .",
    "however , we under - produce the tail of ultra tightly - spaced systems ( period ratios @xmath240 1.5 ; e.g. , kepler-36 , @xcite ) .",
    "our findings are consistent with previous work that modeled the multiplicity distribution parametrically and found the need for two populations to match the observed tranet multiplicity distribution @xcite . without needing to invoke tidal circularization ,",
    "our simulations with moderate residual gas surface density can account for the low eccentricities found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our finding that lower planetary bulk densities are linked to tighter spacings and smaller eccentricities can potentially account for the discovery by @xcite that larger super - earths ( having lower densities , e.g. , @xcite ) have smaller eccentricities .",
    "it can also help to explain the result of @xcite that planets with masses measured via transit timing variations ( which are necessarily more tightly spaced ) have lower bulk densities .    over the past couple decades",
    ", a variety of correlations have been uncovered between the orbital and compositional properties of planetary bodies and properties of their host stars .",
    "these include the connection between giant planet occurrence and host star metallicity ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; the correlation between spin - orbit misalignment and host star temperature ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; the relation between planet radius and host star metallicity ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; the correlation between dynamical excitation and host star metallicity ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; and the connection between kuiper belt objects compositional and orbital properties ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the theoretical connections we found here between super - earths orbital properties and their compositions provide a new test of formation theories .",
    "the simplified simulations and first - order comparisons to observations presented here can be improved upon .",
    "we caution that we did not incorporate photo - evaporation of planetary atmospheres into our models so future studies that search for the predicted links between orbital and compositional properties should either account for photo - evaporation or be limited to periods beyond @xmath115 days .",
    "eccentricity damping from residual gas could be incorporated explicitly into the scaling arguments in section 3 .",
    "more realistic simulations could implement prescriptions for atmospheric growth through accretion @xcite and collisional outcomes @xcite into mercury6 .",
    "longer integrations ( e.g. , to 10 gyr instead of the 30 myr reported here ) are important for detailed quantitative comparisons to the observed sample , because the median spacing increases by about 10% per decade in integration time ( section 5.2 ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "recently @xcite showed that a combination of planets formed from disks of solids with steep and shallow surface density profiles ( a range of @xmath44 ; eqn .",
    "[ eqn : memb ] ) could reproduce the observed distributions of multiplicity , period ratio , and transit duration ratio . to distinguish between theories that rely on differences in surface density slope ( moriarty & ballard ) or on differences in the normalizations of both gas and solid surface densities ( this work )",
    ", future studies should test how tranet properties vary with orbital period .",
    "they should also probe for correlations between orbital and compositional properties  correlations that our work predicts .",
    "a follow - up study focused on planets near resonance could determine whether the gas damping treated here provides sufficient dissipation to produce the observed asymmetry in period ratios near the 3:2 and 2:1 resonances without invoking tides ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the origin of the most tightly spaced planets ( period ratios @xmath241 ) remains a mystery and may be a signature of migration .",
