    "the x(3872 ) state , observed for the first time by belle  @xcite , has been found in many other experiments and is the paradigm of the charmonium states of non - conventional nature ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews on the issue ) . although for some time the quantum numbers were not well determined and both , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 were candidates , theoretical papers showed a preference for the @xmath3 state  @xcite , which has been recently confirmed by the lhcb  @xcite .",
    "the search for this state in lattice qcd simulations has also run parallel and several works have been devoted to this task  @xcite , finding one state close to the experimental one . yet , it was too difficult to unambiguously determine whether one had a bound state or simply @xmath0 scattering states which appear at around the same energy . an important step has been given very recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a bound state is obtained in a dynamical @xmath4 lattice simulation with @xmath5 mev below the @xmath0 threshold and quantum numbers @xmath3 .",
    "improvements on this can be done in the future using larger boxes and smaller pion masses .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to find a strategy to determine accurately the binding energy of the x(3872 ) in lattice qcd simulations . a precise determination , with an energy about 0.2 mev below the @xmath6 threshold , requires to differentiate between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 quark masses in order to account for the 7 mev difference between the neutral and charged components of the wave function  @xcite .",
    "the small binding of the state with respect to the @xmath6 threshold , much smaller than the difference of masses between the @xmath6 and @xmath9 components , makes this consideration imperative in order to get a precise value of the binding energy and unambiguously determine the bound state character of the x(3872 ) .",
    "in fact , when this is done , energy levels can be associated to either @xmath6 or @xmath10 .",
    "the strategy used here follows closely the work of ref .",
    "@xcite using coupled channels , where the energy levels related to the scalar mesons were investigated .",
    "it studies the levels of two - meson interaction in a finite box and tackles the inverse problem of deriving phase shifts from pseudolattice data using lscher formalism  @xcite and different strategies .",
    "the case of bound states is studied along similar lines in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the combination of lscher formalism and methods related to those used in refs .",
    "@xcite allow a precise determination of binding energies of hidden charm states .",
    "thus , in order to have an accurate measurement of the binding energy of the x(3872 ) , we present a method using different number of levels , different box sizes and determine the precision required for the lattice energies .",
    "in this section we discuss briefly the dynamical generation of the x(3872 ) in the continuum limit .",

    "[ eq : tpole ] has a zero between two asymptotes , the number of bound states in the box is now doubled .",
    "it is interesting to note , by looking at figs .",
    "[ fig : leddst ] and [ fig:2ch ] , that the nondiagonal transition potential between the @xmath100 and @xmath114 has a repulsive effect among the levels , which are now more separated than in fig .",
    "[ fig : leddst ] .",
    "once we have determined the dependence of poles of @xmath72 with @xmath73 using the potential for the @xmath117 , we want now to study the inverse problem .",
    "the idea is that qcd lattice data can be used to determine bound states of the @xmath118 system . for this purpose",
    "we assume that the lattice data are some discrete points on the energy trajectories obtained by us . starting with a set of synthetic data of energy and @xmath73",
    ", we wish to determine the potential which generates them .",
    "thus , simulating lattice data , we evaluate the potential , and furthermore , by means of eq .",
    "[ eq : bs ] we determine the pole position of the x(3872 ) in infinite volume with this potential .",
    "this study is very useful since we can estimate the uncertainties in the pole depending on the errors of the lattice data .",
    "thus , we generate a set of data for some @xmath73 for a value of the subtraction constant @xmath119 . in this case",
    "we generate 5 points in a range of @xmath120 $ ] and take 4 levels , this corresponds to @xmath121=0 and 1 in the momentum for both channels @xmath100 and @xmath114 . in addition , we simulate uncertainties in the obtained data , moving randomly by 1 mev the centroid of the energies , then we assign an error of 2 mev to these data . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] we show the simulated set of data .",
    "the second step is to choose the potential .",
    "we have chosen a potential with linear dependence in @xmath122 .",
    "this is given by @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the energy of the first threshold , and @xmath64=1 , 2 and 3 are the indices for each channel ( @xmath64=1 for @xmath100 , @xmath64=2 for @xmath114 and @xmath64=3 for the nondiagonal potential ) .",
    "therefore , there are six parameters to determine in the potential . with all these ingredients , we do the fit , evaluating those values of the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : potfit ] ) that minimize the @xmath125 function . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] we show the result of this fit together with the error band , which is obtained in the standard method  @xcite varying randomly the parameters of the potential in a moderate range ( 10@xmath126 change ) and choosing the set of parameters that satisfy the condition @xmath127 . with these sets of parameters we determine the binding energy of the system with its dispersion from the pole of @xmath128 . in both @xmath72 and @xmath71",
    "we need a value of @xmath43 to determinate @xmath75 or @xmath129 .",
    "the interesting thing that we observe is that the results for the binding energy are essentially independent of the choice of @xmath43 .",
    "changes in @xmath43 revert on changes of @xmath103 that compensate for it .",
    "we made choices of @xmath130 between -1.2 and -2.2 .",
    "representing @xmath127 .",
    "each area correspond to a pair of parameters @xmath131 for the same potential .",
    "points correspond to values of the parameters in the @xmath125 minimum .",
    "( circle and grey area are for @xmath132 and @xmath133 , square and diagonal lined area are for @xmath134 and @xmath135 and diamond and vertical lined area are for @xmath136 and @xmath137 . ) ]",
    "in the previous section we have commented our aim to determine the binding energy of the system with its uncertainty depending on the set of data chosen in the analysis .",
    "we choose several sets of data from fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] , varying also their assumed errors , and show the results obtained for the energy of the bound state in table  [ tab : respoles ] .",
    "we have fitted the first two levels ( @xmath121=0 and 1 ) for both channels @xmath100 and @xmath114 which gives four branches ( b ) in the data .",
    "the first option is taking only the first level with @xmath121=0 , so we have only two branches , which is more realistic for lattice results . with this choice we also consider several options of the number of points ( p ) on @xmath138 .",
    "then we take 5 points ( @xmath138=1.5 , 2.0 , 2.5 , 3.0 and 3.5 ) in one case and 3 points in another one ( @xmath138=1.5 , 2.5 and 3.5 ) .",
    "the last option that we consider is a modification of the error bars of the energies ( @xmath139 ) and the variation in the position on the centroid ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "we choose a first set of high precision with @xmath139=2 mev and @xmath140=1 mev and a second , less accurate , set with @xmath139=5 mev and @xmath139=2 mev .",
    "we have done the fits for different possible combinations of these variations in the data set up .",
    ".all possible set up changing number of branches ( @xmath141 ) , number of points ( @xmath16 ) , energy error bar ( @xmath139 ) and centroid of the energies ( @xmath140 ) and their set of parameters fitted .",
    "the columns denoted as results are the @xmath125 obtained in the fit , the pole is determined with the parameters , and the mean pole and the dispersion are calculated as explained in the text .",
    "the results are for @xmath142 .",
    "as noted in the text , the use of different values of @xmath43 change the potential but not the binding energy .",
    "note that we quote values of total @xmath125 not the reduced one , which is always much smaller than 1 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the results of the fits are shown in table  [ tab : respoles ] , where the first four columns determine the chosen set up of the synthetic data .",
    "the next columns are the fitted parameters , value of @xmath125 and pole position .",
    "the energy values in the `` pole '' column correspond to the pole positions of the @xmath71 matrix using the @xmath129 loop function of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gpropdr ] ) together with the parametrized potential of eq .",
    "( [ eq : potfit ] ) . to test the stability of the pole with the parameters ,",
    "we vary randomly the parameters by @xmath143 .",
    "if the new @xmath125 calculated with those parameters is less than the @xmath125 obtained in the fit plus one , we determine the pole position , otherwise it will be discarded .",
    "we iterate several times until we get 20 or 30 values of the pole positions .",
    "then , we calculate the mean value of those pole positions and their dispersion @xmath144 .",
    "the results are in the line with one should expect : fewer branches , fewer points or bigger errors which reverts into a higher dispersion in the binding energy .",
    "since it is difficult for lattice simulations to calculate higher levels , we have done also the test for the first level of energies for both channels , and in all cases the dispersion of the pole is higher than in the case where two levels are taken into account . since the experimental errors in the binding of the @xmath145 are of the order of 0.20 mev , the exercise done is telling the level of precision demanded for the lattice data if the experimental precision is to be matched .",
    "we have studied the @xmath145 state using coupled channels @xmath100 and @xmath114 in a finite box .",
    "this is done for a small binding energy . in the direct problem , we have reproduced the energy dependence with the size of the box @xmath73 in the two channel case .",
    "we obtain two energy curves for each level corresponding to the neutral and charged channels .",
    "on the other hand , we have addressed the inverse problem , obtaining the potential from the simulated lattice data with the aim of using it to evaluate the pole position in the infinite box case .",
    "the fit of the different setups give us an idea of what one should expect when analysing lattice data .",
    "first one needs that the fit should be good enough , that is , a chi square function should be sufficiently small . in order to reproduce the small binding energies .",
    "in addition , we have observed that in order to get a good precision in the binding energy , one does not need to extract the lattice data with very small errors .",
    "indeed , even with errors in the data points of 5 mev , one can obtain the binding energy with 1 mev ( or even smaller value ) precision .",
    "however , by looking at rows two and three of table [ tab : respoles ] it also becomes clear that very high precision in the binding energy requires small errors in the lattice data . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] , this is necessary to distinguish between the levels of @xmath100 and @xmath114 at large @xmath73 . from a practical point of view , knowing that it is difficult to get four levels in actual lattice calculations , it is rewarding to see that with only two levels one can get quite an accurate value for the binding , provided the levels are evaluated at several values of @xmath73 with enough precision .",
    "we hope that this work gives a reference in the study of lattice qcd for best strategies in order to obtain optimum values of the binding of the @xmath145 state .",
