    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars are the evolutionary descendents of massive o - type stars . with mass loss rates in the interval ( 1 - 5)10@xmath3  and terminal velocities of 1000 - 3000  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , these hot and luminous stars are one of the most powerful stellar wind sources in our galaxy",
    ". of - type stars are also characterized by high mass loss rates and terminal velocities ( lamers & leitherer 1993 ; prinja , barlow & howarth 1990 ) .",
    "the mechanical energy released to the interstellar medium ( ism ) during the wr phase only ( @xmath4 710@xmath5 yr , @xcite ) is in the range ( 1 - 30)10@xmath6 erg , comparable to the mechanical energy injected during a supernova explosion .",
    "both the mass flow from the wr star and the previous o - type star phases strongly modify the energetics , the morphology and the chemical abundances of the ism in the environs of the star .",
    "the interaction of the strong stellar winds with the surrounding interestellar matter has been analyzed by several authors , taking into account different enviroments ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the stellar flow sweeps up the surrounding material creating _ interstellar bubbles _ , which are detected at different wavelengths from the uv to the radio range . in the optical regime",
    ", these structures are generally observed as filamentary ring nebulae in the light of h@xmath7 and [ oiii ] ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". they are related to many wr stars and to a relatively large number of o and of stars .",
    "shell - shaped structures created by stellar winds from massive stars are also identified in the far infrared and in the thermal radio continuum emission ( e.g. @xcite ; cappa , goss & pineault 2002 ) .",
    "interstellar bubbles appear as cavities and expanding shells in the neutral hydrogen 21 cm line emission distribution ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "bubbles are external to their optical and radio continuum counterparts , and expand at relatively low velocities ( @xmath8 10 ) . in most of the cases the derived dynamical ages are larger than the duration of the wr phase , suggesting that the stellar winds of the massive o - type star progenitor has also contributed to creating the structures .    as part of a systematic search for neutral gas bubbles around massive stars",
    ", we present here a study of the ism surrounding wr85 (= hd155603b = lss3982 ) based mainly on  21cm - line data belonging to the southern galactic plane survey ( sgps ) and additional molecular and radio continuum data .",
    "wr85 is classified as wn6h+ob ? .",
    "different distance estimates have been published for this star .",
    "wr85 belongs to the hd155603 group , for which @xcite find a distance of 1.8 kpc . @xcite and @xcite locate the star at d = 3.7@xmath01.3 and 4.7@xmath02.3 kpc , respectively , while hipparcos measurements indicate 1.7 kpc .",
    "the x - ray point like source 1wgaj1714.4 - 3949 coincides in position with the wr star @xcite .",
    "hd155603b is associated with the optical ring nebula rcw118 , of about 25@xmath1 in diameter ( @xcite ; heckathorn , bruhweiler & gull 1982 , @xcite ; @xciteb ) .",
    "@xcite observed rcw118 with the curtis - schmidt-0.6 m telescope at ctio in h@xmath7 , [ oiii]@xmath95007 and [ sii]@xmath96730 .",
    "these authors found that the ionized gas in the nebula has a lsr velocity of 15 , and derived an expansion velocity @xmath10 10  and a dynamical age of 6.710@xmath5 yr , compatible with the duration of the wr phase .",
    "based on the velocity of the ionized gas and on standard galactic rotation models , they estimated a kinematical distance d@xmath11 2.3 kpc .",
    "@xcite reobserved the nebula using the same telescope .",
    "their h@xmath7 image reveals the presence of two semi - circular rings .",
    "the inner ring has a diameter of 93 and is centered on the wr star , whereas the outer one , 25  in diameter , is centered slightly to the south and south - east of the star .",
    "the two concentric structures can be clearly identified in the h@xmath7 image displayed in figure  [ optica ] .",
    "rcw118 is in the same line of sight to the snr g347.30.5 , discovered in the rosat all sky survey ( rass ) by @xcite .",

    "the  21cm - line emission data used in this paper belong to the southern galactic plane survey ( sgps ) ( @xcite ) obtained with the autralia telescope compact array ( atca ) and the parkes radiotelescope ( short spacing information )",

    "we have analyzed 21 cm line data belonging to the southern galactic plane survey searching for an  bubble related to wr85 and its ring nebula rcw118 .",
    "the main results of our search can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the  data allowed the identification of a cavity in the neutral gas distribution surrounded by a slowly expanding shell .",
    "the structure was detected at velocities spanning the interval 28.0 to 16.5 , and has a systemic velocity of 21@xmath05 .",
    "the cavity can also be identified in the co emission distribution at similar velocities .",
    "2 .   the ring nebula rcw118 appears projected onto the inner border of the  shell .",
    "the systemic velocity of the  structure is similar to the velocity of the ionized gas in rcw118 .",
    "wr85 is seen in projection onto the central part of the  cavity and close to its geometrical center .",
    "the coincidence , within errors , of the kinematical distance to the  structure and the stellar distance strongly suggests that the wr star is placed within the cavity .",
    "the morphological coincidence between the inner optical nebula and the  emission at about 28  suggests that the 93 nebula is located on the approaching part of the expanding shell .",
    "the wr star , which appears closely related to the inner nebula , is also probably located near the approaching part of the shell .",
    "the co emission distribution reveals the presence of a molecular shell almost encircling the hi envelope .",
    "the position of the iras protostellar candidates projected onto the molecular shell , suggests that star formation might be occuring in the region .",
    "however , additional studies should be performed to investigate this point .",
    "the stellar wind of wr85 is capable of blowing the observed ionized and neutral structure .",
    "the bulk of evidence ( i ) to ( ix ) strongly indicates that the   structure is the neutral gas counterpart of the optical bubble and shows the action of the stellar winds on the surrounding material .    adopting a distance of 2.8@xmath01.1 kpc ,",
    "the neutral interstelar bubble has a linear radius of @xmath1621 pc .",
    "taking into account an expansion velocity of @xmath172 , its dynamical age is @xmath18 yr , suggesting that both the present wr star and its massive stellar progenitor have contributed in shaping the bubble .",
    "the associated neutral and ionized masses are 3000 m@xmath19 , which indicates that the bubble evolved in a medium with an average ambient density of 3 @xmath20 .",
