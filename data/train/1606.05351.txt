    "early observations of the sub - mm sky , mostly carried out using the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) , revealed a population of very luminous , l@xmath6@xmath710@xmath8l@xmath3  corresponding to associated star - formation rates ( sfr ) @xmath9500m@xmath3yr@xmath4  , high redshift , @xmath1@xmath71 , galaxies which are extremely faint at optical wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the so - called sub - mm galaxies ( smgs ) .",
    "these sources , as a population , are responsible for the release of a significant fraction of the energy generated by all galaxies over the history of the universe @xcite .",
    "their very high ir to sub - mm fluxes , in comparison to the optical and uv outputs , indicate that a significant fraction of the luminosity in these galaxies is heavily obscured @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , smgs contribute about 20% @xcite to the integrated star formation rate density ( @xmath10sfr ) , thus indicating that a large fraction of the star formation in the universe is hidden by gas and dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    mostly due to their optical faintness ,",
    "measuring redshifts and assigning accurate multi - wavelength associations have been difficult and expensive in terms of telescope time .",
    "there is strong evidence that the majority of the smgs are at redshifts greater than unity , with a median redshift for the population of @xmath1@xmath112 - 3 @xcite .",
    "accurate spectroscopic redshifts and well - determined multi wavelength properties have now being derived for a few hundred smgs ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the observed gas and stellar surface densities of these smgs , when coupled to plausible spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , are significantly higher than those of low - redshift iras galaxies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , their luminosities and masses demand that the smg phase be short - lived as compared with the age of the universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the typical depletion timescale in smgs measured from molecular gas co observations is @xmath2100 - 200 myr , in contrast to the much longer , @xmath21 gyr , timescales derived for normal galaxies ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . still , the timescales for high redshift smgs are longer than those seen in local ulirgs , primarily due to the elevated gas fractions in high - redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "smgs are mostly found at @xmath1@xmath71 , and luminous ( @xmath12@xmath710@xmath13@xmath14 ) and ultra - luminous ( @xmath12@xmath710@xmath8@xmath14 ) ir galaxies , ( u)lirgs @xcite are considered their analogues in the local universe . however , while ( u)lirgs in the local universe are extremely rare , with space densities @xmath210@xmath15mpc@xmath16 ( comparable to those of quasars ; @xcite ) , smgs at @xmath1@xmath112.5 have space densities @xmath210@xmath17 higher at similar ir luminosities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this clearly points to a rapid evolution in the most extreme ir luminous galaxies , which has been parameterized as ( 1+@xmath1)@xmath18 with @xmath0@xmath113.5 for the total energy output attributed to these systems out to z@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "hence , while they are relatively unimportant in the local universe , ( u)lirgs can account for up to @xmath250% of the total star formation density by @xmath1@xmath22 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the nature of the large energy output in smgs is now commonly assumed to be associated with their vigorous star formation activity .",
    "nuclear activity is also expected to provide a contribution to the energy emission in a fraction of the systems .",
    "early studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) claimed that a very high fraction , @xmath275% of the radio - selected spectroscopically - identified smgs , can be associated with active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "in contrast , a lower agn fraction , @xmath215 - 30% , was reported for the general smg population @xcite , the vast majority of them subject to heavy obscuration @xcite .",
    "a strong connection between agn activity and strong starburst episodes has been proposed based both on observations @xcite and theory @xcite , in which these events are triggered by the major merger of gas rich galaxies .",
    "spatially - resolved observations of smgs using the _ hubble space telescope _ have not been conclusive in this regard @xcite , finding that smgs at @xmath1=0.7 - 3.4 are in general compact with spheroid / elliptical light profiles .",
    "similarly , recent alma observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have also found that brighter smgs are compact , @xmath20.2@xmath5 , in the sub - mm as well .",
    "integral field unit ( ifu ) spectrographs , in particular those assisted by adaptive optics ( ao ) , have been critical in studying the morphologies and kinematics of smgs at high spatial resolutions .",
    "the first comparison of the dynamical properties from sinfoni ( spectrograph for integral field observations in the near infrared ) installed at the vlt ( very large telescope ) by @xcite showed that bright smgs have larger velocity widths and are much more compact than the uv and optically selected @xmath1@xmath22 star forming galaxies ; they also have lower angular momenta and higher matter densities .",
    "this indicates that dissipative major mergers may dominate the smg population .",
    "early studies in the near - ir by @xcite of 6 high redshift smgs show that they consist of more than one sub - component with significant velocity offsets .",
    "similar results were found by @xcite for eight smgs , who interpreted them as evidence that smgs are systems in the early stages of major mergers .",
    "more recently , @xcite found evidence for the presence of a compact region characterized by broad h@xmath0 emission which can be associated with an agn together with clumps of narrow h@xmath0 emission due to star formation processes . at the same time",
    ", they do not see evidence for ordered motions , hence consistent with a connection between smgs and galaxy mergers .",
    "@xcite observed eight ulirgs that host agn activity and smgs at high redshift with ifu , concluding that the agn activity could be the dominant power source for driving all of the observed outflows , although star formation may also play a significant role in some of the sources .",
    "unfortunately , given the relatively low spatial densities of smgs and the required exposure times using 8 m telescopes and state - of - the - art instrumentation , only relatively small samples of galaxies have been studied so far .    in this paper , we present observations of eight smgs between @xmath1=1.4 and 2.5 using the sinfoni near - ir ifu at the european southern observatory ( eso ) very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "the main goal of this work is to study the morphology and kinematics of the star forming regions in high redshift smgs using the h@xmath0 line as a tracer . in section [ sec : obs ]",
    "we present the properties of the sample studied , the observations , data reduction and analysis .",
    "the results of these observations are presented in section [ sec : results ] , while the discussion and conclusions are presented in section [ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : conclusions ] respectively .",
    "we assume a @xmath19cdm cosmology with @xmath20=0.7 , @xmath21=0.27 and @xmath22=0.73 @xcite .",
    "as described in the previous section , only relatively small samples of targeted smgs at high - z have been studied so far using ifu spectroscopy .",
    "this paper focuses on follow - up ifu observations for eight @xmath1@xmath71 ulirgs selected based on two different and complementary criteria .",
    "hence , it will be possible to study how these selections are related to the properties of the observed sources .",
    "the basic properties of the sources studied in this work are presented in table  [ tab_properties ] .",
    "we categorize our sources in two groups , group a focuses on warm - dust ulirgs , while in group b we include only smgs with a suitable reference star for the ao corrections to have high spatial resolution for kinematic measurements .    ccccccccccccc    j033129.874 - 275722.40 & a & 03:31:29.87 & -27:57:22.40 & 1.482 & 11/2011 & h & 0.80 & 8@xmath5@xmath178@xmath5 & 2.0 & 1.2@xmath23 & 45@xmath244 + j033212.866 - 274640.89 & a & 03:32:12.86 & -27:46:40.89 & 1.930 & 11/2011 & k & 0.64 & 8@xmath5@xmath178@xmath5 & 2.5 & 2.2@xmath25 & 42@xmath249 + j033246.329 - 275327.01 & a & 03:32:46.32 & -27:53:27.01 & 1.382 & 10/2011 & h & 0.65 & 8@xmath5@xmath178@xmath5 & 2.0 & 0.4@xmath26 & 53@xmath2413 + j033249.352 - 275845.07 & a & 03:32:49.35 & -27:58:45.07 & 2.326 & 10/2011 & k & 0.86 & 8@xmath5@xmath178@xmath5 & 2.0 & 8.1@xmath27 & 56@xmath245 + l50879 & a & 03:33:37.67 & -27:46:35.26 & 2.509 & 11/2011 & k & 0.64 & 8@xmath5@xmath178@xmath5 & 2.5 & 0.8 & 46 + rgj030258 + 001016 & b & 03:02:58.94 & + 00:10:16.3 & 2.236 & 10/2012 & k & 0.34 & 3@xmath5@xmath173@xmath5 & 3.75 & 0.77@xmath28 & @xmath746 + smmj04431 + 0210 ( n4 ) & b & 04:43:07.25 & + 02:10:23.3 & 2.509 & 10/2012 & k & 0.35 & 3@xmath5@xmath173@xmath5 & 3.75 & 0.3 & 40 + smmj2135 - 0102 & b & 21:35:11.60 & -01:02:52.0 & 2.326 & 10/2012 & k & 0.34 & 3@xmath5@xmath173@xmath5 & 3.75 & 0.23@xmath29 & 30 - 60 +      group a consists of several warm - dust star - forming ulirgs at @xmath1@xmath21 - 2 . while smgs are proposed to contribute to as much as half of the star formation density at early epochs @xcite , smg observations at 850  @xmath31 m naturally select colder - dust ulirgs with t@xmath32@xmath3345k and",
    "thus potentially miss a whole subpopulation of high - z ulirgs by virtue of their warmer dust temperatures .",
    "recent work by @xcite show that there is a population of ulirgs that are fainter at 850  @xmath31 m and have higher dust temperatures , t@xmath32@xmath1150 k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "these so - called warm - dust ulirgs may contribute significantly to the cosmic star formation rate density at its peak , similar to the smg contribution .",

    "it is possible that these higher temperatures are due to the effects of agn heating .",
    "we have assembled a sample of warm - dust star - forming ulirgs from spectroscopic samples of 250  @xmath31m - selected blast galaxies from the observations described by @xcite .",

    "j033246 , j033249 , j033129 and j033212 ) the redshift was determined based on the detection of the h@xmath0 emission line , while for l50879 the ly@xmath0 line was detected and identified .",

    "the galaxy has a redshift of @xmath1=1.382 , as indicated by the detection of an emission line using vlt / isaac identified as h@xmath0 by @xcite .",
    "the measured rest - frame [ nii]/h@xmath0 line flux ratio of 0.13 suggests that the emission in this galaxy is dominated by star formation activity .",

    "two systems ( j033212 and j033129 ) in our sample were not detected by our vlt / sinfoni observations and thus are not further discussed .",
    "sources in this group were selected roughly independently of the target physical properties . the main goal in this case is to achieve the highest possible spatial resolution for our kinematic measurements .",
    "hence , the only smg selection criteria were the availability of a suitable reference star for the ao corrections ( which for vlt / sinfoni was a r@xmath3314 star closer than 30@xmath5 ) , a measured spectroscopic redshift of @xmath1@xmath21.5 or @xmath1@xmath22.5 , so that h@xmath0 would fall in either the h or k near - ir bands , and that the source is observable at high enough elevation by the vlt .",

    "sources were selected to have a suitable ao reference star , r@xmath3314 mag closer than 30@xmath5 .",
    "hence , observations were taken using the natural guide star ( ngs ) ao mode , using the 100 milli - arcsec pixel scale and a 3@xmath5@xmath173@xmath5 fov . since the main goal of these observations was to map the h@xmath0 emission , we used either the h - band grating , which provides a wavelength coverage of 1.45 - 1.85 @xmath31 m and a spectral resolution of 3000 , or the k - band grating with a spectral resolution of 4000 and wavelength coverage of 1.95 to 2.45 @xmath31 m , depending on the redshift of the source .",
    "the k grating was used for all sources except for j033246 .",
    "the total integration time per source ranged from 2 to 4 hours . since",
    "each source occupied a small fraction of the fov , the surrounding empty regions were used for sky - subtraction , thus achieving a 100% on - source time .",
    "each observation was broken into 1-hour observing blocks ( ob ) , which includes all overheads .",
    "for each ob , a corresponding telluric standard star was observed .",
    "the primary data reduction was performed using the eso sinfoni pipeline version 2.5.2 this pipeline is organized as a set of 6 stand - alone recipes .",
    "the first step evaluates the detector linearity ; this is produced by analyzing flat fields taken with increasing intensity in order to create a map of highly non - linear bad pixels .",
    "then , a master dark frame and a map of hot pixels are created from the median of a series of dark frames .",
    "finally , flat field frames with nearly constant intensity are combined to produce a master flat field and a third bad - pixels map ( bpm ) .",
    "these three bpms are then combined to produce a master bpm .",
    "the pipeline then computes the geometric distortions by placing a fiber at different positions on the detector .",
    "each science frame is therefore corrected for dark current , bad pixels , geometric distortions and then flat fielded and wavelength calibrated .",
    "we then performed sky estimation and subtraction , which is critical when dealing with faint sources , such as those in our sample , at near - ir wavelengths .",
    "since our targets have relatively small spatial extents , the sinfoni fov contains enough source - free area to provide a good sky estimation .",
    "the pipeline provides two methods to estimate and subtract the sky contribution .",
    "the first one , which computes the median of all images on a set as an estimation of the sky , is not very accurate especially when the sky is not stable .",
    "the second method , which we chose for our data reduction , uses the closest frame in time as an estimation of the sky to be subtracted .",
    "all frames are then shifted and co - added .",
    "they contain both spectral and spatial information , and are therefore reconstructed to produce 3d cubes .",
    "the extraction of a 2d image from the data cube for each source was done by creating a pseudo - longslit using the qfitsview software[multiblock footnote omitted ] and its imred analysis option .",
    "the size of the extraction aperture for each source is determined as a compromise between the maximum gathered flux and the minimum sky residual contribution .",
    "then , the apall iraf task was used to extract an integrated 1d spectrum for each source .",
    "finally , additional sky correction , particularly useful to eliminate residuals of sky emission lines , was carried out using the skycorr package @xcite .",

    "krispian lowe as part of his phd thesis[multiblock footnote omitted ] .    in order to estimate the spatial resolution of our observations , for each target we fitted gaussian profiles to the images of the corresponding standard stars . as presented in table 1 , the effective angular resolution for the non - ao targets ranges from 0.64@xmath5 to 0.84@xmath5 , with a mean and median of 0.7 and 0.65 respectively ( corresponding to @xmath20.59 kpc and @xmath20.55 kpc at z@xmath22 ) .",

    "this is in line with previous observations of similar high - luminosity ir and sub - mm galaxies at @xmath1@xmath22 , such as those reported by @xcite and @xcite among others .",
    "a recent analysis presented by @xcite , which takes a sample of local ir - luminous galaxies and artificially redshifts their h@xmath0 ifu data , shows that post - coalescence mergers may also display kinematics that can be wrongly classified as `` disk like '' , as appears to be the case for some of our sources .",
    "@xmath22 in the sins sample .",
    "the background blue points are template disks and red points are mergers , from the library of @xcite .",
    "while 3 out of the four sources , j033246 , rgj0302 + 0010 and smmj2135 - 0102 are located in the `` disk '' region of the diagram , only in one of them ( j033246 ) did we find evidence for ordered motions . in the other two cases , these are clearly clumpy galaxies in which each individual clump is spatially unresolved .",
    "smmj04431 + 0210 ( n4 ) is clearly in the `` mergers '' part of the diagram .",
    "[ fig_kinemetry ] ]      we now compare the star formation rates for the galaxies in our sample , previously derived from far - ir observations , with those obtained from the h@xmath0 observations described here .",
    "the implied star formation rates , including those derived from ir observations obtained from the literature are presented in table  [ tab_spec_der ] .",
    "specifically , we use the values reported by @xcite for j033246 and j033249 from spitzer - mips , blast and laboca observations . for rgj0302 + 0010 the values",
    "were derived by @xcite fitting model spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to the observed 850  @xmath31 m and 1.4 ghz fluxes assuming that the local far - ir / radio correlation @xcite holds at higher redshifts . for smmj04331 + 0210",
    "we used the values obtained by @xcite from observed 850@xmath31 m flux densities and assuming a modified grey - body model ( t=40 k ) and a frequency - dependent emissivity .",
    "finally , for smmj2135 - 0120 values were derived by @xcite from herschel , scuba-2 , vla and apex observations .",
    "both sfr measurements for smmj2135 - 0120 were corrected for lensing magnification assuming a factor of @xmath31=32.5@xmath244.5 @xcite , while a magnification factor of @xmath2=4.4 @xcite was assumed for smmj04431 + 0210 ( n4 ) .",
    "it should be noted that using the same lensing magnification for the h@xmath0 and fir fluxes is not ideal , as these emissions might come from slightly different regions and thus might present small variations in their magnifications .    in figure  [ fig_starformation",
    "] , we compare the sfr derived from the h@xmath0 luminosity with the fir sfrs for the galaxies in our sample , without correcting the h@xmath0 measurements for extinction . we also include in this comparison a sample of 30 high - redshift far - infrared luminous galaxies from @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0 determined sfrs are significantly lower than the values determined from the ir luminosity , by factors of @xmath23 - 5 .",
    "this is most likely explained by both the presence of large amounts of dust obscuration in these systems and if there are fully - dust - obscured sf regions in the galaxy that do not contribute much to the balmer emission lines .",
    "unfortunately , the wavelength coverage of our spectroscopic observations does not extend to the @xmath57 emission line , and thus the reddening in these galaxies can not be estimated directly from the balmer decrement , which would test this hypothesis . however",
    ", if we assume an average extinction value of a@xmath58=2.9@xmath240.5 , as previously used by @xcite and measured by @xcite , we find that the extinction - corrected h@xmath0 sfrs are in good agreement with those derived from the ir .",
    "the scatter seen in figure  [ fig_starformation ] could be explained by a combination of the fact that most of the star formation in these galaxies is not occurring in fully - dust - obscured regions , and due to the morphological diversity of sub - mm / ulirgs - selected galaxies .",
    "estimates of the sfr from the h@xmath0 flux in smgs retain the substantial caveat that in the presence of an agn , the blended nuclear emission may result in the broadening and brightening of the h@xmath0 emission , potentially leading to overestimates of the sfr . due to the large gas and dust reservoirs of smgs , which could potentially provide ample fuel to trigger an agn that could contaminate our estimates of sfr and @xmath10sfr . however , we note that only two sources in our sample show some evidence for the presence of an agn , either via elevated [ nii]/h@xmath0 ratios or a broad line component .",
    "previous ifu studies of smgs have mainly targeted galaxies showing strong agn signatures in their h@xmath0 spectra @xcite , whereas the majority of our sample does not display clear h@xmath0 agn signatures . in smgs , agn were found to only contribute at low levels ( @xmath3320% ) to the bolometric output @xcite .",
    "however , even if an agn is not dominating the bolometric output it may still affect the h@xmath0 distribution and dynamics , being energetic enough to drive ionized gas over scales of a few kpc @xcite .",

    "the smgs in our sample display high sfr surface densities ( @xmath40@xmath52 ) , similar to those found in the most extreme local environments , such as circum - nuclear starbursts and ir - luminous galaxies but over larger spatial extents .",
    "our ifu observations allow us to disentangle agn and starburst - like components ( from [ n ii]/h@xmath0 flux ratios ) .",
    "two of our targets ( rj0302 - 0010 and smmj04431 + 0210 ( n4 ) ) show possible signs of agn activity surrounded by star - forming regions / clumps .",
    "we then further confirm that these extreme smgs at high-@xmath1 appear to follow the same star - formation scaling relations as less luminous `` normal '' star forming galaxies .",
    "smgs in our group b sample are the only ones which present evidence for agn activity .",

    "<S> we present near - infrared integral - field spectroscopic observations targeting h@xmath0 in eight sub - millimeter galaxies ( smgs ) at @xmath1=1.3 - 2.5 using vlt / sinfoni , obtaining significant detections for six of them . </S>",
    "<S> the star formation rates derived from the h@xmath0 emission are @xmath2100 m@xmath3yr@xmath4 , which account for only @xmath2 20 - 30% of the infrared - derived values , thus suggesting that these systems are very dusty . </S>",
    "<S> two of these systems present [ nii]/h@xmath0 ratios indicative of the presence of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . </S>",
    "<S> we mapped the spatial distribution and kinematics of the star forming regions in these galaxies on kpc - scales . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the h@xmath0 morphologies tend to be highly irregular and/or clumpy , showing spatial extents of @xmath23 - 11  kpc . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence for significant spatial offsets , of @xmath20.1 - 0.4@xmath5 or 1.2 - 3.4 kpc , between the h@xmath0 and the continuum emission in three of the sources . performing a kinemetry analysis </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the majority of the sample is not consistent with disk - like rotation - dominated kinematics . instead </S>",
    "<S> , they tend to show irregular and/or clumpy and turbulent velocity and velocity dispersion fields . </S>",
    "<S> this can be interpreted as evidence for scenario in which these extreme star formation episodes are triggered by galaxy - galaxy interactions and major mergers . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to recent results for smgs , these sources appear to follow the same relations between gas and star forming rate densities as less luminous and/or normal star forming galaxies . </S>"
