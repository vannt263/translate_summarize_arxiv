    "thin - film solar cells based on  ( cigse ) are fabricated and deployed worldwide on an industrial scale due to their outstanding price / performance ratio  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to silicon - based solar cells  @xcite , the efficiency of cigse cells with polycrystalline light absorber exceeds the efficiency of their monocrystalline counterpart  @xcite .",
    "this is remarkable , because typically the performance of optoelectronic devices is considered to be worse for polycrystalline semiconductors due to the presence of grain boundaries ( gbs ) .",
    "gbs are expected to create deep gap levels that act as recombination centers and are commonly regarded detrimental for the solar - cell performance . despite the extensive studies carried out in the past decades to investigate the effects of gbs on the efficiency of cigse - based solar cells , their role remains a topic of intense debate .    in the literature , different atomic structures for symmetric gbs in  and  have been reported .",
    "abou - ras  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite identified and studied experimentally two types of  3 ( 112 ) gbs in : se - se - terminated \\{112 } plane gbs and cation - se - terminated \\{112 } plane gbs . while the former showed cu depletion and in enrichment , cu depletion without in enrichment",
    "was detected for the latter .",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , reported no change in the atomic composition near the cation - se - terminated \\{112 } plane gbs .",
    "this discrepancy could be due to different methods employed to study the atomic composition  @xcite .",
    "another type of  3  gb , namely  3 ( 114 ) , has been studied in  and  @xcite .",
    "although this type of gb is not experimentally identified in  and , its structure is adopted from gbs in cdte .",
    "a common feature of the  3  gbs is that high percentage of these gbs in  and  are charge neutral  @xcite .    due to the complex nature of thin - film devices , it would be highly desirable to achieve new insights from theoretical calculations .",
    "such results can serve as common ground between experimentalists and theoreticians leading to a better understanding of the properties of devices .",
    "taking advantage of the calculated results makes experimentalists able to improve the cells in the laboratory scale .",
    "consequently these knowledge can be transferred to the industrial scale .",
    "the outcomes of the previous first - principles studies on gbs , however , are not conclusive  @xcite . in their pioneering work , persson and zunger  @xcite employed lda and lda+u method to study the cation - terminated ( 112 ) surface of  to explain the anomalous characteristics of the symmetric gbs .",
    "they proposed that the valence band maximum ( vbm ) of the surface is lower than the bulk vbm therefore the gbs act as a hole barrier .",
    "the cu vacancy reconstruction at the surface , which lowers the surface vbm with respect to the bulk vbm , is in contrast to the results of yan _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "other authors employed different flavors of ( local ) lda and ( semi - local ) gga to study the  3 ( 114 ) gbs in  and . while some studies  @xcite suggested that these gbs do not create any gap state , the other studies predicted the formation of deep gap states in the bandgap of the systems with gbs @xcite .",
    "the results achieved by ( semi- ) local methods remain doubtful , even if they are in agreement with experimental findings .",
    "this is because of the employed methods in the aforementioned studies that do not describe the semiconducting nature of  and  adequately  @xcite .",
    "namely , for the defect - free  and  bulk , the bandgaps predicted by pbe and pbe+u are severely underestimated  .",
    "this failure is partly due to the shortcomings of ( semi- ) local methods and partly due to underestimation of the anion displacement ( @xmath0 ) of  @xcite .",
    "the size of the bandgap is of particular importance when the defect states , which might appear in the bandgap , are studied . in light of the shortcomings of the underlying methods , the inconsistencies between previous works are not surprising . in this work",
    "we report on the first - principles hybrid functional study of two types of  3  gbs , namely  3 ( 112 ) and  3 ( 114 ) , in  and .",
    "hybrid functionals are known as a rather accurate method to study the electronic structure of semiconductors . in this approach a portion of the exact exchange calculated by hartree - fock method",
    "is incorporated into the exchange - correlation functional calculated by density functional theory ( dft ) . in the present work",
    ", we used hse06 functional  @xcite with the fraction of the exact exchange set to  @xcite . using this setup ,",
    "the value of the anion displacement is calculated with an error smaller than and the computed bandgaps are and for  and , respectively , in agreement with experimental values  @xcite .",
    "all calculations have been performed within the framework of dft as implemented in vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp )  @xcite .",
    "we used the projector augmented wave ( paw )  @xcite method together with a plane - wave cutoff energy of and a mesh of ( @xmath1 ) k - points .",
    "for density of states ( dos ) calculations a denser k - mesh has been used .",
    "the supercells consist of 128 and 180 atoms for the  3 ( 112 ) and  3 ( 114 ) gbs , respectively . to construct the supercells ,",
    "the optimized lattice constants and atomic positions of the bulk have been used .",
    "the distance between periodic supercells separated by vacuum is about .",
    "slab calculations , which are generally employed to represent a material with gbs , might suffer from the charge transfer through the slabs due to dangling bonds at the surfaces of the slabs .",
    "to quench the dipole moment of the slabs and prevent charge transfer , the surface dangling bonds were passivated with hydrogen - like pseudoatoms with partial charges .",
    "the valency of these hydrogen - like pseudoatoms are chosen in such a way that they provide the amount of missing electrons for the surface atoms , so they fulfill the octet rule .",
    "the position of atoms in the outer four atomic layers were fixed to their bulk position to mimic the underlying bulk material .",
    "other atoms were fully relaxed until the forces on each atom were below . using the same methodology , a defect - free supercell with \\{112}-plane termination was constructed and considered as the reference .    to evaluate the relative shift of the vbm and conduction band minimum ( cbm ) with respect to the bulk , the macroscopic average of the electrostatic potentials are calculated  @xcite .",
    "the vbm shift can be expressed as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the energy difference from the vbm to the reference level of system 1   and @xmath4 is the energy difference from the vbm to the reference level of system 2 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bandalignment ] .",
    "the energy difference @xmath5 and @xmath6 are calculated in the region far form the gbs and are very close the values calculate for the perfect periodic bulk . by knowing the size of the bandgap , the cbm shift calculation is straightforward .",
    "the crystal structure of  and cdte has the same fundamental characteristics and the gbs in  and  can be modeled based on the observed gb structures in cdte . in the present work ,  3 ( 112 ) and  3 ( 114 ) correspond to lamellar and double - positioning twins in cdte  @xcite . in the  3 ( 112 ) gbs , either a cation - containing plane is next to a se - containing plane (  3 ( 112)-i ) or se - containing planes are facing each other (  3 ( 112)-ii ) . in the  3 ( 114 ) gbs , either se atoms have dangling bonds (  3 ( 114)-i ) or cations have dangling bonds (  3 ( 114)-ii ) . the atomic structure of the  3 ( 112 ) and  3 ( 114 ) gbs are very different : while the  3 ( 114 ) gbs contain dangling , wrong , and extra bonds the atomic structure of  3 ( 112)-i is very similar to the bulk and the  3 ( 112)-ii gb contains se dangling and se - se wrong bonds .",
    "the atomic structures of gbs in  after geometry optimization are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : gbs ] . while",
    " 3 ( 112)-i shows little changes in its structure ,  3 ( 112)-ii undergoes dramatic structural relaxation . compared to the bulk , se atoms at the  3 ( 112)-ii gb are not surrounded by four cations .",
    "after optimization , the minimum distance between se atoms increases from to .",
    "in contrast to , se atoms at the  3 ( 112)-ii gb of   ( not shown here ) are not located at the outermost layer of the gb : on one side of the gb se atoms migrate into the bulk and instead of se - se wrong bonds at the gbs , se - cation bonds are formed . in a qualitative agreement with the previous studies",
    "@xcite , in the  3 ( 114 ) gbs the atoms with dangling bonds show larger relaxation compared to the other atoms .",
    "it has been discussed that dangling and wrong bonds in cdte can create defect levels  @xcite . since the  3 ( 114 ) and  3",

    ", we calculated atom - projected partial dos for the systems with gbs .",
    "the projected partial dos for the  3 ( 112 ) and  3 ( 114 ) gbs in  are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : doscis ] .",
    "all gbs ( except  3 ( 112)-i that creates no gap state ) create unoccupied gap states close to the cbm which are in resonance with the conduction band states in agreement with the @xmath7 simulations  @xcite . from the total energy of the charged ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) gbs we have computed the thermodynamic charge transition levels . in  and , the positively - charged gbs are not stable but the defect states can trap electrons to make the gbs negatively charged .",
    "our data show that the existence of gbs shifts the vbm and cbm with respect to the bulk vbm and cbm .",
    "this can lead to ` electron - free'/`hole - free ' zone near the gbs where the concentration of electrons / holes is less than in the grain interior ( gi ) .",
