    "lunar occultations ( lo ) are a method to obtain high angular resolution by means of the analysis of the diffraction pattern generated when a background source is occulted by the lunar limb .",
    "one major advantage of lo is the fact that the angular resolution achieved is mainly dependent on relations between the wavelength and the distance to the moon , rather than the aperture of the telescope as in standard imaging .",
    "thus , the measurement of angular sizes well beyond the diffraction limit of even the largest telescopes on the ground or in space becomes possible .",
    "significant limitations of the method are that the sources can not be chosen at will , that the events are time - critical , and that opportunities to repeat the observations are rare . in order to detect and measure the diffraction fringes , it is necessary to sample the light curves with time resolutions of order 1ms .    at least three major goals can be achieved by lo : the measurement of stellar angular diameters , the detection and characterization of circumstellar envelopes and extended emissions , and finally the study of small - separation binary stars . for decades , lo have made contributions in the first two areas above , but currently long - baseline interferometry , more time consuming but more complete in its results , is often used ( see charm2 catalog , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . concerning binary stars",
    ", however , lo maintain an edge in that they are quick to observe , easy to analyze , and offer a combination of sensitivity and dynamic range which remains unsurpassed .",
    "in the course of a long program of occultations with the isaac instrument at the eso vlt , ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) have recorded over a thousand occultation events with an @xmath4% detection rate of mostly new binary or multiple systems , the majority of which are out of reach of other techniques .",
    "the isaac instrument has now been decommissioned , and only few observatories around the world remain suitably equipped to observe lo .    in this paper",
    "we first introduce the thai national telescope ( tnt ) , in conjunction with the ultraspec fast camera , as a new facility capable of recording high quality lo light curves in a geographical area where this technique was so far precluded .",
    "we then present the first lo results obtained at the tnt , and discuss in detail two of them : @xmath5  cnc , a claimed binary star for which we can put stringent upper limits on the separation and flux of the putative companion ; and hr  7072 , a known binary star for which the numerous measurements available until now seem to be not always in agreement and for which we provide a new accurate flux and separation determination .",
    "the thai national observatory , which includes also the flagship 2.4 m thai national telescope ( tnt ) , is located on one of the highest ridges of doi inthanon , the tallest peak in thailand . at 2457 m elevation",
    ", the site has observing conditions which compare favorably with those of most other locations in the region in terms of seeing and photometric conditions .",
    "it has a dry season which runs approximately from november to april , while the rest of the year is largely lost to observations due to high humidity and rainy conditions .",
    "the tnt was erected in 2012 and inaugurated in january 2013 .",
    "it is a ritchey - chrtien with two nasmyth foci , one of them being equipped with a multi - instrument port which mounts permanently also the ultraspec instrument .",
    "although a similarly named instrument based on the same detector has been used before , e.g. at the eso new technology telescope in chile @xcite , the one described here is novel in several aspects : in particular the optics have been specifically developed for tnt , and specific data acquisition modes have been developed .",
    "ultraspec at the tnt had its first light in november 2013 and is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here , we summarize only its capabilities for lo work .    in order to increase the time sampling ,",
    "ultraspec offers the possibility to read out only parts of the detector .",
    "one of its features is the 2k@xmath61k emccd chip , half of which is used for imaging and half for fast frame transfer .",
    "one or several subarray windows can be defined and read out simultaneously , and this is optimal to reach rates up to about 10  hz . for lo measurements , however , faster rates are needed . for this , the so - called drift - mode of the related instrument ultracam @xcite has been specifically adapted . in summary",
    ", two small windows can be selected along the same detector rows .",
    "although their position is freely selectable , the most efficient configuration is to place them close to the lower edge of the detector .",
    "a mask is then remotely positioned to cover the rest of the detector area . as",
    "the selected windows are pushed to the frame transfer area , the rows immediately above are shifted down and are ready for the next integration .",
    "other features that we do not describe in detail here are the possibility of on - chip rebinning and three levels of detector read - out speed .",
    "we have successfully tested the drift mode up to rates of 450hz .",
    "thanks to a large memory and to fast fiber links between the instrument electronics , the control computer and the data reduction machine , it is possible to obtain uninterrupted data sequences of any desired duration and to examine the data almost in real time . finally , we mention that a dedicated gps is used to stamp each frame with its mid - exposure time .",

    "is then converted to fits cubes , with the first two dimensions set by the combination of sub and bin , and thousands of frames long . from this point ,",
    "our data analysis procedure follows closely the methods already described in our previous papers , see e.g. @xcite and references therein . in summary",
    ", we adopt a mask extraction that allows us to reject unnecessary signal ( and related noise ) from the background , and end up with fast photometry sequences which are further restricted to very few seconds around the events .",
    "we use a model - independent maximum - likelihood method to estimate the brightness profile of the source , for example to detect possible multiple components in the light curve .",
    "a model - dependent least - squares method , whose convergence in @xmath13 is driven by noise components derived from the unocculted and totally occulted portions of the light curve , is used to derive precise values and errors of parameters such as intensities and separation in a binary model @xcite .",
    "this reference also describes additional features used in our fits such as the modelling of low - frequency scintillation .",
    "the first three sources in table  [ table : occlist ] were found to be point - like , with upper limits on the angular size of 2.4 and 1.5mas for sao  93721 and sao  97913 , respectively .",
    "these are consistent with the values expected from their spectral types and distances . the s / n of the sao  96543 light curve was insufficient for an upper limit determination .",
    "there were no previous literature reports on possible binarity for two of these sources , while sao  93721 is listed in the washington double star catalog .",
    "it has a faint , distant companion at about 170@xmath14 which is not included in our observation , and is also listed as a spectroscopic binary which we could not resolve . in the following ,",
    "we concentrate on the remaining two stars in our list .",
    "although these first measurements are few , table  [ table : occlist ] can be used for some initial estimate of the performance of lo with ultraspec at the tnt . using s / n=1 as a detection limit , the sensitivity achieved in the 5 light curves ranged from 9.3 to 10.4mag , with a dynamic range that in the best case was 5mag . the ability to resolve close companions",
    "was tested by means of simulations on the data of sao  93721 and @xmath5  cnc .",
    "we conclude that hypothetical companions with 1:1 flux ratio could have been detected as close as 2  mas .",
    "we obtained a good quality ( s / n=104 ) light curve of the bright star @xmath5  cnc ( hr  3572 , acubens ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alfcnc ] , along the position angle ( pa ) 77@xmath15 .",
    "the diffraction fringe pattern is well resolved thanks to the use of a narrow band filter and also to a contact angle of 40@xmath15 that contributed to slow down the apparent fringe motion .",
    "we could thus accurately measure the local limb slope , found to be close to 0@xmath15 , obtaining in turn a reliable conversion from time to angular scale .",
    "the star is known to have a companion forming the ads  7115 pair ; this is however about 10@xmath14 away and several magnitudes fainter , and we do not concern ourselves with it here .",
    "more interestingly , @xmath5  cnc has been claimed as a close double , mainly from previous lo observations but also from the analysis of hipparcos data .",
    "these are listed in the fourth catalog of interferometric measurements of binary stars ( by hartkopf , mason and wycoff , available online ; int4 hereafter ) .",
    "the two claims from previous occultations come from observations by amateur astronomers with small telescopes , and are not well documented .",
    "they claim a binary with equal components separated by 50mas in one case ( with no pa listed ) , or 4.2mas along pa=113@xmath15 in the other .",
    "we note that the ability to measure such a small separation by lo usually demands a rigorous treatment of high quality data .",
    "the bright star catalogue mentions in a note that @xmath5  cnc is a lo binary with @xmath16 separation , but without a reference .",
    "several speckle measurements with the soar 4.1 m telescope have not detected the companion , with upper limits @xmath17 on the angular separation and 4 to 6mag on the flux difference .",
    "in fact , for @xmath11m@xmath18mag the separation limit is 25mas ( tokovinin , priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "our data appear to be the first lo light curve recorded of this bright star with professional equipment at a medium - sized telescope .",
    "we can reliably exclude two components of similar brightness , to projected separations as small as 3mas ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : alfcnc ] ) .",
    "in fact , an analysis by a method developed for unresolved sources ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) results in a limit of 1.35mas on the angular size of the star .",
    "this is consistent with a stellar dimension roughly comparable to solar and a distance of 53pc as derived by hipparcos .",
    "for a simple comparison , we assume that the 50mas binary separation previously claimed was at a random position angle , and we consider an average projection factor @xmath19 . the resulting estimated 79mas true separation , against our upper limit of 3mas , would indicate a likelihood of @xmath20% that our lack of detection was due to projection effects .",
    "we note that the previously claimed binary separation would imply a period of very few years , and therefore any link between the geometry during our measurement in 2014 and the previous ones ( as much as 30 years earlier ) would not be preserved .",
    "the s / n of our light curve can also be used to assess an upper limit in flux on the presence of a companion with a more significant separation , of about 5mag in the red part of the spectrum .",
    "we mention also two light curves @xmath5  cnc , the disappearance and reappearance of the same event , observed with a 30-inch telescope in a 5214 interference filter by @xcite .",
    "the authors also found no evidence of binarity , but given the small telescope size scintillation was significant and the constraint on a putative companion was weaker than that from our data .",
    "the other indication of binarity in @xmath5  cnc comes from hipparcos , which detected an acceleration in the proper motion , interpreted as due to a companion .",
    "however no orbital solution could be derived and the nature of the companion ( separation and mass , hence brightness ) remains undetermined , and likely unrelated to the putative companion claimed by previous lo reports .",
    "@xcite , after examining several radial velocities catalogs , found no evidence of @xmath5  cnc being a spectroscopic binary .",
    "our reappearance light curve of hr  7072 ( kui 88ab , hip 92301 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hr7072-lo ] and it clearly reveals a companion .",
    "we find a flux ratio of 3.38@xmath210.01 , and a projected separation of 90.7@xmath210.2mas along pa=238@xmath15 . in order to successfully record the reappearance event",
    ", we opted for a larger subarray which resulted in a relatively slow sampling .",
    "thus , we are not able to determine independently the speed of the fringe pattern , and in turn we have an uncertainty on the the local limb slope and correspondingly on the pa and projected separation",
    ". however , an analysis of the lunar limb at the given point of contact and libration angles was made using the altimetry data from the kaguya probe ( herald , priv .",
    "comm . ) , and no significant local limb slope was found .",
    "hr  7072 is a known sub - arcsecond binary , with over 30 previous astrometric and lo determinations , starting from the initial discovery by @xcite and extending over 54 years .",
    "a list can be found in int4 , and additionally we mention @xcite .",
    "our result extends the time coverage to almost 65 years .",
    "an orbital solution has not yet been established , and in fact the interpretation of the available data is not straightforward .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : hr7072-orb ] shows the ra , dec position of the companion . for the lo results , which only provide a projected separation , we have plotted the lines that represent the loci of equivalent position . at a first glance",
    ", it can be noticed that the positions tend to cluster around the [ + 150,@xmath22400]mas region , with the notable exception of the points on the negative ra half - plane which are all prior to 1960 .",
    "these were visual determinations , while later measurements were obtained by speckle interferometry , the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : hr7072-orb ] puts the measurements , expressed now as pa and separation , along a time sequence .",
    "it can be seen that both quantities follow an almost linear evolution with time , however with the noticeable exception of two points .",
    "these are marked as outlined , rather than solid , symbols , on both panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : hr7072-orb ] .",
    "the first one is the discovery measurement by @xcite , the second one is the latest measurement , prior to ours , obtained by @xcite .",
    "the former was obtained by visual interferometry , the latter by speckle , but both at relatively smaller telescopes than the majority of the other determinations .",
    "we remark that most of the literature values do not have an associated error , so that it is difficult to verify quantitatively possible discrepancies .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : hr7072-orb ] we have made an attempt to estimate pa and separation for the two previous lo measurements and our own , based also on a visual fit to the rest of the points in the left panel .",
    "it can be seen that in this view the apparent discrepancy of the @xcite measurement could in fact be reconciled given a reasonable error , as expected from the method .",
    "the @xcite measurement is critical , in that taken at face value it points to a significant turn in the orbit .",
    "accordingly , we provide two pa - sep equivalents for our lo result : one fits a linear trend in time of pa and separation , consistent with a very long orbital period .",
    "the other follows the indication of the @xcite measurement , and reinforces the view of a closed orbit which would then seem to have a period of few 10@xmath23  y.    concerning the flux ratio , the available data span the range from 400 to 800 nm , and are quite consistent in their trend indicating that significant variability of either component can probably be excluded , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hr7072-flux ] .",
    "our own determination is in close agreement with this trend .",
    "the conclusion is that one of the two stars is significantly bluer than the other .",
    "measured the radial velocity of this system on two dates only , separated by just one year .",
    "they did not detect any variations .",
    "they quote the spectrum as composed of a1 and k0 .",
    "@xcite reported a1v and k1iii .",
    "this , together with the integrated color of @xmath24mag , points to the fact that the two stars have similar brightness in the blue , but that at longer wavelengths the k0 component is the primary .",
    "this is consistent with , who found a 12@xmath25 m excess for this star and mentioned binarity as a possible explanation .",
    "we reported the first lo observations from the thai national telescope equipped with the ultraspec instrument . using the specifically developed drift - mode ,",
    "time sampling of few milliseconds can be achieved . in the first observing season of this new facility , we have recorded 5 lo light curves and we have discussed in detail two of them .    in the case of @xmath5  cnc a duplicity has been previously claimed , although not convincingly demonstrated .",
    "we do not detect the companion , with an upper limit of 3mas in projected separation and 5mag in flux ratio . in the case of hr  7072",
    ", our measurement goes to complement a set of over 30 previous determinations , extending the time coverage from 54 to 65 years .",
    "we show that the data are still ambiguous , pointing to the detection of an orbital arch and a few 10@xmath23  y period , or alternatively to a much wider and longer orbit .",
    "observations by adaptive optics would quickly confirm one of the two scenarios .",
    "the flux ratios are consistent with an early a and an early k spectral types , with similar brightness in the blue but with the k type component dominating at longer wavelengths .",
    "the tnt with ultraspec in drift mode has successfully demonstrated high performance lo results , with a sensitivity estimated at @xmath26mag at s / n=1 , an angular resolution close to 1mas , and a dynamic range of at least 5mag .",
    "this facility is especially attractive in consideration of the fact the lo events are observable only along restricted ground tracks , and that no comparable capabilities existed until now in south - east asia .",
