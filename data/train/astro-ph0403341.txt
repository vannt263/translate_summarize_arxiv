    "many galactic black hole and neutron star sources in low mass x - ray binaries show both chaotic and quasi - periodic variability in their observed x - ray fluxes .",
    "some of the quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) are in the khz range and often come in pairs @xmath0 of _ twin peaks _ in the fourier power spectra ( e.g. , van der klis , 2000 ) . in all four black hole sources with twin peak khz qpos pairs , @xmath1 ( mcclintock & remillard , 2003 ) . for neutron stars",
    "sources the ratio of twin - peak frequencies is mostly close to @xmath2 too ( abramowicz , bulik , bursa , kluniak , 2003 ) . based on these and other properties of qpos kluniak & abramowicz ( 2000 ) concluded that twin peak khz qpos are due to a resonance in the accretion disc oscillation modes and they noticed that the specific @xmath3 ratio could be a consequence of strong gravity .    according to the standard shakura - sunyaev accretion disc model , matter spirals down into the central black hole along stream lines that are located almost on the equatorial plane @xmath4 , and that locally differ only slightly from a family of concentric circles @xmath5 .",
    "the small deviations , @xmath6 , @xmath7 are governed , with accuracy to linear terms , by    @xmath8    here the dot denotes the time derivative . for purely keplerian ( free ) motion @xmath9 , @xmath10 and",
    "the above equations describe two uncoupled harmonic oscillators with the eigenfrequencies @xmath11 , @xmath12",
    ".    we shall start with an argument which appeals to physical intuition and which shows that the resonance now discussed is a very natural , indeed necessary , consequence of strong gravity .",
    "assume that in thin discs , random fluctuations have @xmath13 thus , @xmath14 is a first order term in @xmath15 and should be included in the first order equation for vertical oscillations ( [ equation1 ] ) .",
    "the equation now takes the form ,    @xmath16 \\delta \\theta = \\delta a_{\\theta},\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is a known constant .",
    "the first order equation for @xmath18 has the solution @xmath19 . inserting this in ( [ equation5 ] ) together with @xmath10 ,",
    "one arrives to the mathieu equation ( @xmath20 is absorbed in @xmath17 ) ,    @xmath21 \\delta \\theta = 0,\\ ] ]    that describes the _",
    "parametric resonance_. from the theory of the mathieu equation one knows that when    @xmath22    the parametric resonance is excited ( landau & lifshitz , 1976 ) . the resonance is strongests for the smallest possible value of @xmath23 . because near black holes and neutron stars @xmath24 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) , the smallest possible value for resonance is @xmath25 , which means that @xmath26 .",
    "this is an example of a situation in which parametric resonance works in a thin accretion disc and it intuitively explains the observed 3:2 ratio ( kluniak and abramowicz , 2002 ) , because , obviously ,    @xmath27    of course , in real discs neither @xmath28 , nor @xmath10 exactly ; moreover in realistic situations , for purely geodesic motion ( @xmath29 ) the system does not show increasing amplitudes ( the higher terms prevent this from occurring ) .",
    "+ however , one may expect that because these equations are approximately obeyed in thin discs , the parametric resonance will indeed be excited .",
    "such a resonance was found in numerical simulations of oscillations in a nearly keplerian accretion disc by abramowicz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "the equations roughly outlined in the previous section will now be derived .",
    "the equations of the geodesic motion of a unit mass test - particle in spherical coordinates can be written in the form ( @xmath30 ) :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the effective potential and @xmath33 is the energy .    consider a geodesic on the equatorial plane @xmath34 and perturb it slightly , keeping constant the angular momentum .",
    "@xmath35    here @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote small devations from the circular orbit , and to first order they describe two uncoupled harmonic oscillators with epicyclic eigenfrequencies :    @xmath38    the ratio of the two frequencies is    @xmath39    this does not happen in the newtonian case where the radial and vertical frequencies are always equal to the orbital frequency ( @xmath40 ) . when continuing to higher orders in the taylor expansion , the two motions become coupled , and this is why the so - called parametric resonance can arise .",
    "the perturbed equations are nonlinear differential equations with constant coefficients which are the values of the different derivatives of the effective potential @xmath41 and the metric at equilibrium ( see appendix [ subsec : notation ] ) :    @xmath42    in the case of schwarzschild s metric ,    @xmath43    the third order terms in the taylor expansion provide the damping which saturates the increasing amplitudes : this motivates stopping the expansion at this order of the perturbation .",
    "+ in first approximation we used paczyski & wiita ( 1980 ) pseudo - newtonian model .",
    "the perturbed equations in the model and in general relativity look the same , apart from those terms in @xmath44 which involve @xmath45 that here are absent . + on the geodesics @xmath46 ; however , in order to explore the features of the resonance , a small additional isotropic force , parametrized by @xmath47 $ ] , can be added ( @xcite ) ; this force at the moment has no physical meaning ( it may be a coupling due for example to pressure or viscosity ) , it is just a mathematical tool .",
    "then    @xmath48    when @xmath49 the previous equations are just the approximation of the geodesics , while when @xmath50 increases , they describe slight deviations from the free motion .",
    "this method is a variation of the straightforward expansion which leads to a unformly valid approximate solution of systems of weakly nonlinear differential equations ; the underlying idea is to consider the expansion which represents the approximate solution to be a function of multiple independent variables , or scales , instead of a single variable .",
    "the new `` time - like '' independent variables are defined : @xmath51 expressing the solution as a function of more variables , treated as independent , is an artifice to remove the secular terms , which would make the solution to explode unphysically .",
    "+ by writing @xmath52 one makes a formal assumption of physical slow variation explicit .",
    "indeed @xmath52 define progressively longer time scales , which are not negligible when @xmath53 is of the order of @xmath54 or longer .",
    "the characteristic time scale of the orbital motion near a neutron star or a stellar mass black hole is short ( @xmath55ms ) : hence for @xmath56 of the order of @xmath57 the dynamical effects on the scale @xmath58 become important in the interval of @xmath59s .",
    "+ the conditions to eliminate the secular terms give a simpler system of differential equations : for a set of initial conditions the solution to such a system is a sum of trigonometric functions .",
    "the same solution can be found by assuming a priori that the asymptotic solution is the sum of trigonometric functions in which the dominant terms have frequencies not far from the original eigenfrequencies of the uncoupled harmonic oscillators ( method of lindstedt - poincar ) .",
    "the corrections to the eigenfrequencies depend on the amplitudes and on the constant coefficients hence in a fourier transform of the geodesics perturbed in the vicinity of @xmath60 , two peaks centered near @xmath3 would be found , the position of which and the ratio depend on the perturbation ( @xmath61 ) and on the initial amplitudes .",
    "this method was used to find the approximate solution to equations ( [ eqperturbategr ] ) ( both when @xmath62 , hence @xmath63 and not ) : @xmath64    the coefficients of the trigonometric functions ( @xmath65,@xmath66,@xmath67 .. ) are constants which depend on @xmath68 and the initial conditions",
    ". for simplicity of notation here the initial phases are equal to zero .",
    "the taylor expansion at constant angular momentum to third order near the stationary point of the effective potential leads to two nonlinear differential equations with constant coefficients :    @xmath69    the polynomials of third degree ( @xmath70 ) which constitute the nonlinear part of the equation depend on the symmetry of the effective potential and of the metric .",
    "+ the first part of the method of multiple scales consists in some algebraic calculations that highlight what are the so - called regions of resonance .",
    "indeed the coefficients of the approximate solution are found to have in the denominators terms like @xmath71 .",
    "these @xmath23 and @xmath72 can not take any value , but they depend on the symmetry of the effective potential , the metric and the perturbation via the @xmath73 which are present in the equations : the allowed @xmath23 and @xmath72 indentify the candidate regions of resonance .",
    "the symmetry restricts further these regions : it could happen that the constant coefficients cancel and then there would be no resonance at all . this calculations performed for a general effective potential @xmath74 showed that the following resonances , usually present , can not appear in the * plane - symmetric * case : @xmath75 the * only * possible resonances to this degree of approximation are then : @xmath76 since in general relativity @xmath77 ( this is due to the curvature of the space ) , then the only possible resonance is the @xmath3 , which is indeed observed most of the times in black holes candidates . in the next approximation",
    "a new resonance appears , @xmath78 , and one may find many other possible @xmath79 .",
    "however a property of parametric resonance is that the region of instability becomes thinner when @xmath80 increases : the `` higher '' resonances are less probable ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is why we do not observe them .",
    "+ landau & lifshitz (  mechanics \" 1976 ) , when studying systems similar to ours ( chapter @xmath81 par.@xmath82 ) with the non - geodesic terms @xmath62 , use the method of lindstedt - poincar and they conclude that these are the solution we are interested in , because in a closed system , without any source of energy , there can not be a spontaneus increment in the intensity of oscillations . in this sense",
    "we asserted that _ ",
    "no parametric resonance occurs for strictly geodesic motion\"_(@xcite ) : the initial conditions of the perturbation of the geodesics are related to the energy ; even if the initially small two perturbations couple and exchange energy , their amplitudes can not become observable .",
    "an approximate solution for schwarzschild s perturbed geodesics was obtained and the validity of the approximation was verified a posteriori for initial conditions of the order of @xmath57(which were used in the numerical integration ) .",
    "+ in this solution two modes remain locked , with the two frequencies near to the @xmath3 ratio : the value of these frequencies is were we would see the twin peaks in the fourier power spectra of the observed signal .",

    "the dependence on them is almost linear . +",
    "the analytic approximation in figure ( [ fig3 ] ) was obtained by fixing @xmath91 ( far from geodesics ) and @xmath92 : each point on the segment corresponds to the state reached by the system starting from differemt initial conditions ( @xmath93 $ ] and @xmath94 $ ] ) .",
    "the same slope was matched numerically ( in the pseudo - newtonian case ) by fixing the initial conditions and by varying @xmath61 + the fact that the slope is smaller than @xmath3 depends on the choice of the initial conditions .",
    "this analytic result is important in explaining the behaviour of the solution more than the numerical values : the fact that the observed ratios are not exactly in @xmath3 ratio is a feature of parametric resonance and the position of the centroid frequencies depends on the strength and features of the non - linear perturbation .",
    "the taylor expansion of the relativistic geodesics to the third order leads to two coupled harmonic oscillators : the purely geodesics motion is stable , while when it is perturbed there are cases for which parametric resonance may occur . + using the method of multiple scales one can highlight that , owing to the curvature ( through the way it determines the effective potential ) , the first allowed resonance between the radial an the vertical epicyclic frequencies is the @xmath3 , in agreement with the numerical analysis .",
    "+ moreover the deviation of the slope from @xmath3 is easily explained as a property of such a non - linear resonance + the analysis of this toy - model reinforces the theory that indeed the observed pairs of qpos may be due to parametric resonance , and finally to the strong gravitational field alone .",
