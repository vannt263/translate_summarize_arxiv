    "in 1983 , the _ iras_satellite detected a large infrared excess from vega ( @xmath1 lyr ) during a routine calibration observation ( aumann et  al .",
    "soon , a similar excess was detected from three more stars ( @xmath2  pic , fomalhaut and @xmath0  eri ) .",
    "the excess could only be explained by a shell or ring of dust , heated to between 50 and 125  k by the central star .",
    "quite by accident , _",
    "iras_had uncovered the first examples of solid material orbiting a normal main sequence star other that our own sun .",
    "the four stars mentioned above have become the prototypes for the ` vega excess ' phenomenon ( backman & paresce 1993 ; lagrange , backman & artymowicz 2000 ) .",
    "a systematic study of the _ iras_all - sky survey shows that around 15  per cent of all main - sequence stars have an ir excess due to circumstellar dust ( dominik & the hjhvega consortium 1997 ; fajardo - acosta et  al .",
    "coronographic and sub - mm imaging has shown the dust is typically in a ring or disk geometry ( smith & terrile 1984 ; holland et  al . 1998 ) and that these systems have much in common with our own solar system , i.e.   solid material in stable coplanar orbits distributed within a region roughly the size of the kuiper belt .",
    "though the vega phenomenon is common , the poor resolution of current far - ir and sub - mm instruments means that few vega excess stars are close enough to be resolved . for the cases where the disks are resolved , detailed analysis using realistic models for the optical properties and size distribution of the dust can be performed .",
    "this type of work has been attempted for @xmath2  pic(li & greenberg 1998a ) , hr4796 ( augereau et  al .",
    "1999b ; li & lunine 2003a ) and fomalhaut ( wyatt & dent 2002 ) .",
    "these models use the observed spatial distribution of dust , and fit the sed by varying the dust composition and size distribution .",
    "however , as these objects have been analysed on a case - by - case basis , different models and assumptions are used , which makes it somewhat difficult to make direct comparisons .",
    "in addition , there are so few resolved targets that it is impossible to look for statistical trends between disk size , age , stellar mass , etc .",
    "however , there are many unresolved targets with good sed information , and new instruments such as sirtf and sofia will produce many more such objects . a method which could retrieve the physical parameters of a disk from just its",
    "sed would be invaluable . to accomplish this ,",
    "the detailed properties of the dust grains in vega excess disks must be fully understood .",
    "we have tried to tackle these problems in two ways .",
    "firstly , we have made sub - mm photometric observations of vega excess stars , to help constrain their seds .",
    "secondly , we have attempted to model all known vega excess stars with sub - mm data , using a consistent model with realistic dust grains .",
    "this allows us to directly compare the results of modelling for resolved targets , and use the knowledge of dust grain size and composition gained to estimate the disk size for the unresolved targets .",
    "sub - mm observations were made using the scuba bolometer array on the james clerk maxwell telescope .",
    "the observations were made as part of several different observing programmes , and hence data was obtained in different observing modes .",
    "in addition , we have reduced unpublished archive observations of suspected vega - excess stars to enlarge our sample .",
    "the observations are summarised in table  [ tab : observations ] .",
    "scuba can be used in two ways , either for photometry or for mapping .",
    "the distinction arises because the bolometers are spaced too widely to fully sample the image at the focal plane .",
    "therefore in mapping mode , the moving secondary mirror is used to add slight offsets to the telescope pointing , and hence fill in the gaps in the map . whilst this is ideal for extended sources , for an observation of an unresolved object a lot of time",
    "is spent where no bolometer can see the source . to prevent wasting observation time in this way photometry mode can be used , which does not attempt to make a fully sampled map . in this mode ,",
    "the central bolometer is always on source , and hence the observation will be more sensitive .",
    "the disadvantage is that a fully sampled map is not produced , so if the object is resolved the measured flux will underestimate the true flux .",
    "this mode should therefore only be used if the target is known to be point - like .",
    "although a full jiggle map is not used in this mode , a small 9-point map is used to prevent small pointing errors from affecting the measurement .    for some of the observations",
    "an extended photometry mode was used , which used a 9-point map with a spacing of 5  arcsec between each point , instead of the normal 2  arcsec spacing .",
    "the aim of this was to ensure that the true flux was measured even if the source was marginally resolved , whilst retaining most of the sensitivity advantage of photometry mode .",
    "also , some data was taken using a 12-point pattern , with four points at the centre and eight points arranged around the central position , at a distance of 7  arcsec .",
    "data from these extended photometry modes were reduced in exactly the same way as the conventional photometry .",
    ".new observations used in our analysis .",
    "observations before 2000 were extracted from the jcmt archive .",
    "the extended photometry of hd128167 was observed with a 12  point pattern , all other extended photometry is 9  point .",
    "[ tab : observations ] [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]      mid and far ir photometry data is taken from the _",
    "iras_faint source catalogue ( moshir et  al . 1990 ) .",
    "where available , this is supplemented by ground based mid - ir data from the literature .",
    "also , published _",
    "iso_photometry has been added to help constrain the far - ir part of the seds ( in particular data from habing et  al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "our model of the dust grains is based on the assumption that the grains in protoplanetary disks are aggregates of interstellar dust grains , with an additional ice component frozen into them as they grow .",
    "this type of model was originally developed to simulate cometary grains ( greenberg 1982 , 1998 ) , but it has also been successfully applied to the dust grains in accretion disks ( pollack et  al .",
    "1994 ) , and to the debris disks of @xmath2  pic(li & greenberg 1998a ) , hr4796 ( augereau et  al . 1999b ; li & lunine 2003a ) , hd141569 ( li & lunine 2003b ) and hd207129 ( jourdain de muizon et  al . 1999 ) .    for the composition of the interstellar grains , we use the core - mantle model developed in & greenberg ( 1997 ) , which successfully fits the observed interstellar extinction and polarisation .",
    "this model has a silicate core surrounded by a uv - processed organic refractory mantle .",
    "we force the silicate / organic - refractory volume ratio to be 1:2 , as inferred for cometary grains ( greenberg 1998 ) .",
    "the grains are assumed to be porous , with the porosity being a free parameter of the model . for dust grains cooler than @xmath3 k , the gaps due to porosity may be filled with either vacuum , water ice or a mixture of the two ; for dust grains warmer than @xmath3 k most ices would sublime , so the gaps must be filled with vacuum .",
    "the free parameters in the dust composition model are therefore the porosity @xmath4 of the grains and the ice fraction @xmath5 , with the constraint that for warm grains the ice fraction must be zero .",
    "optical constants for the materials are taken from & greenberg ( 1997 , 1998a ) .",
    "the optical constants for the composite dust grain material are then calculated using maxwell - garnet effective medium theory .",
    "then , the absorption efficiencies for the dust grains are calculated using mie theory , rayleigh - gans theory , or geometric optics , depending on the size of the dust grain .",
    "details of maxwell - garnet effective medium theory , and the methods used to calculate absorption efficiencies are discussed in bohren & huffman ( 1983 ) .",
    "the size distribution that results from an infinite collisional cascade is ( dohnanyi 1969 ) : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of planetesimals of size between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "however , this distribution will only hold for large dust grains , as radiation pressure will blow out small grains ( e.g.  @xmath11 @xmath12 ) very rapidly , and poynting - robertson drag will cause intermediate sized grains ( e.g.  @xmath13 @xmath12 ) to spiral inwards toward the star . which of these two effects is dominant depends on the optical depth of the dust disk , but for all but the most tenuous disks the collisional timescale is shorter than the pr timescale , so pr drag can be safely ignored ( wyatt et  al .",
    "1999 ) . given this , we assume that the above size distribution holds down to the radiation blowout limit , when @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 ) , at which point there is a sharp cutoff .      for the spatial distribution of the dust grains ,",
    "we assume a infinitely thin , flat ring , with the ring s radius @xmath16 as a free parameter .",
    "this approach is motivated by the sub - mm images of fomalhaut and @xmath0  eri , which both show a narrow , well defined ring of emitting material .",
    "this spatial distribution is different from that used in wyatt & dent ( 2002 ) , as here no attempt is made to account for the eccentricities of the dust grains , which broadens the ring by about 50  au .",
    "the advantage of the simpler model is that it reduces the number of free parameters , but should still give a reasonable estimate of the overall extent of the disk .",
    "the fomalhaut results from the two versions of the model are almost identical ( see section  [ sec : fomalhaut ] ) , which gives us confidence that this simplification will not affect our conclusions .",
    "accurate stellar parameters are needed for several reasons .",
    "firstly , the photospheric flux must be estimated in each band , so that the excess flux due to dust can be determined .",
    "this is particularly important in the _",
    "iras_12  and 25  @xmath12bands , where the photosphere can be the dominant source of flux .",
    "secondly , the temperature of the dust depends on the luminosity of the star , and on the shape of the star s spectrum in the region where most power is emitted ( i.e. uv  optical  near - ir ) .",
    "the luminosity and stellar spectrum also determine the magnitude of the radiation forces which act on the dust grains .",
    "finally , an estimate of the mass of the star is needed to calculate the gravitational forces .    to determine the stellar parameters",
    ", we first obtained the spectral type of each star from simbad .",
    "this was used to estimate the star s effective temperature , using the calibration provided in gray & corbally ( 1994 ) .",
    "we then extracted a kurucz model atmosphere with this effective temperature , assuming solar metallicity and surface gravity @xmath17 appropriate for dwarf stars .",
    "the model atmosphere was then normalised to fit the k band magnitude .",
    "k band was preferred over optical photometry because it is less susceptible to the effects of reddening .",
    "the luminosity of the star was then calculated by integrating the normalised model atmosphere .",
    "finally , the mass of the star was estimated using the observed spectral type and the table provided by lang ( 1992 , page 132 ) .",
    "a model sed is specified by the grain composition ( porosity @xmath4 , ice fraction @xmath5 ) , radius of the dust ring ( @xmath16 ) , and the total dust luminosity . in the cases where",
    "the size of the dust ring is known , the ring radius is fixed to the observed size ; for the unresolved objects the ring radius is left as a free parameter .",
    "the approach we take is to choose a dust composition , and then find the best fit to the data by varying the remaining free parameters .",
    "the emission spectrum of an individual dust grain depends on its temperature and on the emission efficiency as a function of wavelength .",
    "the sed of a disk is simply the combined emission of all the dust grains . for a given dust composition model , the absorption efficiency",
    "is calculated as a function of grain size .",
    "given this , the temperature of the dust grains as a function of grain size and distance from the star can be determined .",
    "then , the total flux as a function of wavelength is found by integrating over all grain sizes , weighting with the size distribution given in equation [ eqn : size_dist ] .",
    "the model spectrum is then converted into an sed that can be directly compared to the observed points to obtain a @xmath18 value . to do this , the spectral response of each filter - instrument combination",
    "is multiplied by the model spectrum , to estimate the broad - band flux that would be recovered from a real observation of the model spectrum .",
    "this step is particularly important for the _ iras_data points , which have a very wide band - pass . by converting the model spectrum into broad - band fluxes ,",
    "we avoid having to make colour - correction to the original data , which would otherwise require detailed knowledge of the true spectrum of the source . however , when showing the result of the fit , a colour - correction must be applied so that the data points can be plotted in real units . for this purpose ,",
    "the best fitting model is used to estimate the colour correction for each point .",
    "if the best model is more than 3  sigma away from a data point , then no colour - correction is applied to that point , as the model is not likely to give a good estimate of the true colour - correction .",
    "for some objects it is impossible to fit all the data points simultaneously , because there is dust at a range of distances from the star . in these cases ,",
    "only the long wavelength points are fitted , in order to obtain an estimate of the overall extent of the ring .",
    "the size of fomalhaut s dust disk is known from the sub - mm images made with scuba ( holland et  al .",
    "2003 ) . because the ring is inclined and the images have low resolution the size of the ring can not be measured directly from the images , but the best estimate of the true size is 150  au ( wyatt & dent 2002 ) .",
    "the sed data for fomalhaut comes from _ iras _ , scuba and also _ iso_. the _ iso_fluxes are from walker et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , and are listed in wyatt & dent ( 2002 ) .",
    "our modelling ( figure  [ fig : fom_sed ] ) shows a good fit for solid dust grains ( i.e. @xmath19 ) , but rules out porous grains as this would make the dust hotter than is observed .",
    "the @xmath20 , @xmath21 model is also ruled out , as it fails to fit the mid - ir part of the sed .",
    "the reduced @xmath18 for the best fitting model is 4.2 , which indicates that the model is not consistent with the data .",
    "however , by far the dominant contribution to @xmath18 comes from the _ iso_data , which show considerable scatter from any smooth model .",
    "the _ iso_filters all have broad band passes ( @xmath22 ) , so the apparent scatter in the _",
    "iso_points is unlikely to be due to structure in the spectrum .",
    "a more likely explanation is that uncertainties on the _",
    "iso_points have been underestimated , and this would explain the high reduced @xmath18 .",
    "fomalhaut has already been modelled in detail by wyatt & dent ( 2002 ) , and the results here are almost identical to those results .",
    "as the modelling here uses the same data and dust grain model , it is hardly surprising that we recover the same results .",
    "however , this does confirm that the simpler spatial distribution used here does not significantly affect the results of the modelling .",
    "hr4796 is resolved in both mid - ir images of dust emission ( jayawardhana et  al .",
    "1998 ; koerner et  al . 1998 ) and scattered light images in the near - ir ( schneider et  al . 1999 ) .",
    "the best estimate of the size of the ring comes from mid - ir images , which suggest that the radius is 70  au . the star is younger than most of the other stars in the sample , with a age of @xmath23 myr ( stauffer et  al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the modelling results show that solid dust grains are unable to fit the observed sed and disk size ( figure  [ fig : hr4796_sed ] ) .",
    "however , using a porosity of @xmath20 provides a good fit to the sed .",
    "the icy model ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) is a worse fit than the solid grain model , so can be rejected . around 10  @xmath12 , there is an additional excess which can not be accounted for by any model .",
    "this is likely to be produced by a hot dust component close to the star .",
    "data in this part of the spectrum have therefore been excluded from the fit , and do not contribute to the total @xmath18 quoted in table  [ tab : fits ] .",
    "detailed modelling of this object has been done previously by ( 1999b ) , and our results here are in good agreement with this work .",
    "augereau et al .",
    "made a much more thorough exploration of parameter space , but their overall conclusion was that two dust populations are required : a cool component at 70  au , and a hotter component at about 10  au .",
    "their best fitting model for the cool dust has amorphous grains with a porosity of @xmath24 and an ice fraction ice @xmath25 . in their analysis ,",
    "the ring s diameter was constrained to be 70  au , but the grain porosity , ice fraction and the width of the dust ring were all left as free parameters . as for fomalhaut , our results confirm that the simpler model used here is able to produce similar results to a more detailed model .",
    "modelling of hr4796 has also been done by li & lunine ( 2003a ) , and they were able to fit the entire sed without having a hot dust component , in contrast to the results of ( 1999b ) and the results presented here .",
    "this discrepancy is probably because li and lunine s model contains a large number of grains which are much smaller than the blowout diameter , and these small grains produce a hot component in the sed even though they are distant from the central star .",
    "@xmath0  eriis a particularly interesting object , as it is the only cool star ( k2v ) with a resolved dust disk , all other resolved disks being around a stars .",
    "scuba images of @xmath0  erishow a distinct ring , which is approximately face on and has a radius of 60  au ( greaves et  al .",
    "1998 ) .    in modelling @xmath0  eri s dust disk",
    ", a problem arises due to the low luminosity of the star .",
    "our model for the dust size distribution assumes that radiation pressure will remove the smallest dust grains .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath0  erithe radiation pressure is not sufficient to blow dust grains out of the system when porous dust grains are used ( figure  [ fig : epseri_beta ] ) .",
    "in this situation , it is not clear what limits the size of the smallest dust grains . as a first step",
    ", we made the ad - hoc assumption that when porous grains were used , the small size cutoff is set at the grain size where @xmath2 is greatest , i.e.  where the radiation force is most significant compared to the gravitational force .",
    "modelling using this assumption produced a very interesting result : all of the models predict too much flux in the mid - ir , and too little in the sub - mm ( figure  [ fig : epseri_comp ] ) .",
    "this means that our models have too many small ( and therefore hot ) dust grains .",
    "this is an unexpected result , as there is no obvious mechanism for removing the small grains . by varying the minimum size cutoff explicitly ,",
    "an excellent fit is possible if the cutoff size is set to 3.5  @xmath12and the @xmath26 model is used , as shown in figure  [ fig : epseri_size ] .",
    "it is also possible to obtain a good fit using porous grains , but only if the minimum size cutoff is set to around 300  @xmath12(figure  [ fig : epseri_size_porus ] ) .",
    "this model does not predict the observed excess at 25  @xmath12 , but this flux could come from an additional hot component close to the star . modifying the slope of the size distribution can improve the fit ( figure  [ fig : epseri_slope ] ) , but can not make the model consistent with the data .",
    "solid dust grains with a size of 3.5 @xmath12have a @xmath2 of about 0.15 , much less than is needed to remove the grains by radiation pressure .",
    "it therefore seems that the disk around @xmath0  ericontains few grains smaller than about 3  @xmath12 , and radiation pressure from the star can not explain this deficiency .",
    "possible causes for this discrepancy are discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "recently , detailed modelling of @xmath0  erihas been presented by li , lunine & bendo ( 2003 ) who modelled the sed and scuba image using a porous dust model ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) , and were able to get an excellent fit .",
    "with this in mind , our results seem somewhat surprising , as they favour solid rather than porous grains , and fail to produce an acceptable fit at all unless grains with diameter smaller than 3.5  @xmath12are excluded .",
    "the discrepancy arises because of several differences in the assumptions made within the two models .",
    "the most important difference is that li et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) set a maximum grain size cutoff at a diameter of 2  cm , whereas in our modelling the maximum grain size is set to be 10  m. if the collisional cascade model is true , then the real size distribution will extend up to very large bodies ( i.e. kilometre scale and bigger ) , but the limit of 10  m is chosen because bodies of this size and larger make a negligible contribution to the sub - mm flux ( i.e. the longest wavelength data included in our fits ) , and so can be safely excluded from the model .",
    "this is not true of 2  cm bodies , as grains of around this size can make a very significant contribution the the flux at 850  @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , li et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) set an a priori limit on the minimum grain diameter at 2  @xmath12 ; our finding that we must remove grains smaller than 3.5  @xmath12is therefore in reasonable agreement with this ( the remaining discrepancy is due to the fact that li et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) allow the slope of the size distribution to be a free parameter , whereas in the models where we modified @xmath29 , @xmath30 was fixed to be @xmath31 ) . finally , li et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) have a different spatial dust distribution , with a peak at 55  au and fwhm of 30  au , compared with the infinitely thin ring at 60  au used in our model .",
    "the broad spatial distribution has not been considered here as it would make our sed fit worse . because li et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) set tight limits on the size distribution , the dust sed becomes quite sharply peaked , and a broad spatial distribution is needed to make the dust sed wide enough to fit all the points .",
    "conversely , in our model the broad size distribution means that the model sed is already _ too _ wide , so a broad spatial distribution would only make things worse .",
    "given the low signal to noise of the scuba image , a direct measurement of the width of the dust ring is not possible .",
    "dent et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) also modeled the @xmath0  eridata , and were able to fit the sed using a modified blackbody .",
    "the fitted parameters indicated that the disk must contain large grains ( @xmath32 @xmath12 ) , but this type of modelling does not constrain the composition or porosity of the dust grains .",
    "the original estimate for the size of vega was made by aumann et  al .",
    "( 1984 ) , who analysed special pointed observations made with _ iras_after the discovery of a far - ir excess .",
    "the estimated diameter was 23  arcsec at 60  @xmath12(corresponding to a radius of 90  au ) .",
    "subsequently , this data was reanalysed , giving a larger diameter of @xmath33 arcsec ( 135 au ) ( van der bliek , prusti & waters 1994 , and references therein ) .",
    "this discrepancy is attributed to the fact the aumann et al .",
    "did not account for the photospheric emission at 60  @xmath12 , and hence underestimated the extent of the excess emission .",
    "however , sub - mm observations made with scuba on the jcmt indicate a diameter of @xmath34 arcsec ( holland et  al .",
    "1998 ) , similar to the original estimate from the _ iras_data . at millimetre wavelengths ,",
    "aperture synthesis imaging has been done using the plateau de bure interferometer ( wilner et  al . 2002 ) and owens valley radio observatory ( koerner , sargent & ostroff 2001 ) . both of these observations suggested that the vega disk is very clumpy , and found bright clumps at a distance of 9  arcsec ( plateau de bure ) and 12  arcsec ( owens valley ) from the central star .",
    "this could indicate a disk radius as small as 70 au .",
    "given these observations , it is not obvious what the true size of the disk is , and so we were unable to fix this parameter in our model fits .",
    "instead , we fitted different grain models with disk size as a free parameter . with this approach",
    "we find that all of the dust grain models fit equally well ( figure  [ fig : vega_sed ] ) , but predict very different disk sizes .",
    "the porous grain models both have a fitted radius much larger than any of the observations , with the @xmath20 , @xmath28 model suggesting a radius of @xmath35 au , and the @xmath27 , @xmath28 model giving @xmath36 au . these models can therefore be rejected .",
    "however , the solid grain model ( @xmath19 ) gives a radius of @xmath37 au , and the icy @xmath20 , @xmath21 model gives @xmath38 au , both of which are compatible with the observations .",
    "without more detailed analysis of the structure observed in the disk , it is impossible to distinguish between these two options .",
    "there is a small additional excess at 25  @xmath12(@xmath39 jy ) , which none of the models account for .",
    "this could either be due to an additional warm dust component similar to that found for hr4796 , or because the spatial distribution is broad , with dust at a range of distances from the star .",
    "@xmath2  picis the most extensively studied vega excess star , with observations in scattered light , mid - ir , far - ir , sub - mm .",
    "the system is not a ring , but a disk with dust at a variety of distances from the star .",
    "the system has been modelled in detail by & greenberg ( 1998a ) , and our simpler model is not adequate to deal with the extended spatial structure of the disk .",
    "however , we have included @xmath2  pichere in order to show the consequences when our model is applied to objects where the dust is not contained within a ring .",
    "the ring morphology is one of the key assumptions of our model , so it is extremely important that we can determine whether or not this is true for unresolved objects .",
    "to fit the sed , we used the same approach taken for vega , i.e.  we left the ring radius as a free parameter , and fitted each dust composition to the sed .",
    "the modelling shows that it is not possible to fit the observed sed with any single model regardless of what dust composition is chosen ( figure  [ fig : betapic_sed ] ) .",
    "this is a helpful result , in that it shows that we are able to distinguish between a disk and a ring morphology purely from the sed .",
    "however , this modelling reveals little else about the composition and size distribution of dust grains in @xmath2  pic .",
    "hd141569 has a resolved circumstellar disk , first directly detected in near - ir scattered light images ( augereau et  al .",
    "1999a ; weinberger et  al .",
    "1999 ) , and subsequently resolved in mid - ir thermal emission ( fisher et  al .",
    "2000 ; mouillet et  al .",
    "2001 ; marsh et  al .",
    "most recently , the disk has been observed with the acs coronagraph ( clampin et  al .",
    "2002 ) , revealing that the structure observed in the disk is probably caused by a tidal interaction with a bound binary system at a projected distance of around 1000  au .",
    "the age of the system has been estimated to be @xmath40 myr ( weinberger et  al . 2000 ) , making it one of the youngest stars in our sample .",
    "however , despite its youth the disk appears to be in a collisional cascade , as modelling shows that it contains small dust grains which must leave the system on a very short timescale ( fisher et  al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the mid - ir imaging shows that the overall size of the disk is around 100 au , but the emission is produced at a range of distances from the star from 20  au outwards ( marsh et  al .",
    "this is also apparent from our sed modelling , as no model can simultaneously fit all the data ( figure  [ fig : hd141569_sed ] ) .",

    "this indicates that the thermal emission is probably produced by porous grains , in agreement with the modelling done by li & lunine ( 2003b ) .",

    "however , no model can simultaneously fit all of the data ( figure  [ fig : hd109085_sed ] ) .",
    "this indicates that there must be dust at a variety of distances from the star , as is the case for @xmath2  picand hd141569 . for our fitted model , the _",
    "iras_12  and 25  @xmath12points have not been included , so the fitted radius reflects the size of the coolest parts of the disk , i.e.   the disk s overall extent .",
    "this gives a result of 180  au , which at a distance of 18.2 pc gives an angular radius of 9.9 arcsec .",
    "this is more extended than the scuba beam , so our flux estimate is probably smaller that the true flux by a factor of @xmath39 ( table  [ tab : extphot ] ) .",
    "given the size and brightness of the disk , it should be possible to fully map hd109085 with scuba , and such observations are currently being performed ( wyatt et al . in preparation ) .",
    "hd38393 is extremely faint in the sub - mm , and is only detected at the 2.4 sigma level .",
    "the modelling produces a good fit to the sed ( figure  [ fig : hd38393_sed ] ) , but with a disk radius of @xmath41 au for solid dust grains . at the distance of hd38393 ( 9.0 pc )",
    ", this corresponds to a radius of 22  arcsec .",
    "this would place most of the flux outside the scuba beam ( even though the extended photometry mode was used ) , implying that the true flux at 850  @xmath12is much higher than the measured flux .",
    "in fact , if this radius is correct we would only detect emission if the source is edge on . revising our estimate of the 850 @xmath12flux results in a still larger fitted radius ( because a higher sub - mm flux indicates a cooler disk ) , and",
    "so does not resolve this problem .",
    "nor does choosing a different dust composition , as porous grains tend to be warmer than solid grains , and so also increase the estimated disk size .",
    "given the low significance of the detection , it is possible that the 850  @xmath12detection is either spurious , or caused by a background galaxy .",
    "using source counts of galaxies detected in blank fields ( e.g.  figure  11 in scott et  al .",
    "2002 ) , we find there is a 6  per cent probability that a 2.4 mjy background source will fall into the beam of scuba in extended photometry mode ( which is sensitive over a 300  arcsec@xmath42 area ) .",
    "( 2001 ) also concluded that their 170  @xmath12detection is likely to be due to a background galaxy , given the low flux and the galaxy number counts at that wavelength .",
    "however , an alternative explanation is that the estimate of the disk size is wrong : the difficulty fitting the sed of @xmath0  erimay indicate that our model is generally unreliable for cool stars , and hence the true size of the disk could be smaller than 200  au .",
    "this would mean that the disk is deficient in small grains compared with our model .",
    "excess sub - mm emission from @xmath43  boowas detected at the 3.6 sigma level , with a flux of 6.7 mjy .",
    "however , the best fitting model gives a disk radius of @xmath44 au , which corresponds to an angular radius of 20  arcsec , implying that most of the 850  @xmath12flux would be outside the scuba beam even in extended photometry mode .",
    "in addition , the best fitting model predicts a much lower 850  @xmath12flux than the observed value .",
    "as is the case for hd38393 , there is no model which is consistent with both the sed and the spatial constraints given by the scuba beam size .",
    "the problem is unlikely to be caused by errors in the far - ir data : the _ iras_and _ iso_results are entirely consistent , and the _",
    "iso_170  @xmath12observation has a beam radius of about 45  arcsec , so all the flux would be detected with _ iso _ , even if the disk really is very large .",
    "\\(2001 ) considered the possibility that their _",
    "iso_detection at 60  and 170  @xmath12was due to a background galaxy .",
    "they concluded that the excess was probably real , but could not rule out contamination by a background source .",
    "a background galaxy with a flux of 6.7 mjy is unlikely to fall into the scuba beam by chance alone ( 1 per cent probability ) , but as @xmath43  boowas selected on the basis of a far - ir excess , contamination by a background source becomes more likely .",
    "the alternative explanation is that @xmath43  boois deficient in small grains , which would reconcile the modelling results with the scuba beam size .",
    "hd48682 is a quoted as visual binary in the washington double star catalogue with a separation of 34  arcsec .",
    "however the two stars can not be physically associated due to their differing proper motions , and it appears that hd48682b is in fact a background object .",
    "given that the separation of the two components is similar to the _",
    "iras_beam size , it is not obvious whether the photosphere of the secondary will contribute to the _ iras_fluxes or not .",
    "iras_beam is different at each wavelength , as the diffraction limit is much smaller at 12  @xmath12than it is at 100  @xmath12 .",
    "this means that the secondary photosphere may only contribute to the measured fluxes at longer wavelengths .",
    "in addition , it is very difficult to estimate the brightness of the secondary at _ iras_wavelengths , because the star is most likely an m star and only optical photometry is available .",
    "a small uncertainty in the effective temperature therefore causes a large error in the estimated mid - ir flux . a k band image would resolve this problem , but unfortunately the secondary star is saturated on 2mass images , so a dedicated observation would be required .",
    "aumann & probst ( 1991 ) made ground based observations of hd48682 at 10  @xmath12 , and concluded that the 12  @xmath12excess comes from @xmath45 arcsec from the primary and is consistent with the flux from the secondary , but that the secondary photosphere can not account for the large 60  @xmath12excess .",
    "our detection with scuba confirms that the 60  @xmath12_iras_excess is associated with the primary and not the secondary , but the source of the 12  and 25  @xmath12excess is not clear .",
    "figure  [ fig : hd48682_sed ] shows the sed of hd48682 , and the best fit model .",
    "the modelling has been done in two ways , with and without the secondary included in the photosphere subtraction ( assuming a spectral type m0 ) . at 12  @xmath12 , the iras flux is more than the photosphere of the primary , which could either be due to circumprimary emission at @xmath45 arcsec , or flux from the secondary . at 25  @xmath12 , the _ iras_flux is more than the combined flux from primary and secondary , indicating that there is definitely emission by dust at this wavelength .",
    "there is a large excess at 60  @xmath12 , and the secondary photosphere could only make a small contribution even if it is within the beam .",
    "the modelling results are better if the secondary is included in the photosphere subtraction ( reduced @xmath46 , verses 7.0 if the secondary is not included ) .",
    "if the secondary is not included in the subtraction , the estimated radius is @xmath47 au , whereas if the secondary is included , the estimated radius is @xmath48 au . if the larger value is true , the projected radius would be 6.7 arcsec , so the disk could be marginally resolved with scuba mapping .",
    "the shape of the fitted model indicates that there would be only a small excess at 18  @xmath12 , so resolved ground based imaging would be difficult .",
    "hd207129 is not detected in our reduction of archived scuba measurements , but because there are _ iso_measurements at 170  @xmath12a model fit is possible , and the scuba upper limit also helps to constrain this fit .",
    "the sed and model fit are shown in figure  [ fig : hd207129_sed ] .",
    "the fitted size of the disk is @xmath49 au , which corresponds to an angular radius of 17  arcsec .",
    "since this is larger than the scuba beam a significant fraction of the flux would not have bean detected , and the quoted upper limit on the 850  @xmath12flux may actually be lower than the true flux .",
    "hd207129 was observed in both photometry mode and map mode , and the quoted upper limit of @xmath50 jy is based on both sets of measurements .",
    "if just the mapping data is used , then an integrated flux over a 20  arcsec radius aperture can be calculated .",
    "this method gives a flux @xmath51 jy ( 3 sigma ) .",
    "the most striking result of our modelling is that there is a large diversity in dust grain compositions between different disks .",
    "a simple explanation for this result is that dust grain composition may vary with age .",
    "the modelling of hd141569 and hr4796 ( age 5  and 8  myr respectively ) indicates high porosity grains ( @xmath27 ) , as does the previous modelling of @xmath2  pic(age 20  myr ) done by & greenberg ( 1998a ) .",
    "however , solid grains are indicated for fomalhaut and vega ( ages 150  and 350  myr ) .",
    "it may be that the older stars have less porous grains because the collisional cascade has reprocessed the initially fluffy grains into a more solid form .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the change in porosity is due to the effects of stellar radiation on the dust , as suggested to explain the differences between the porosity of long and short period comets ( mukai & fechtig 1983 ; li & greenberg 1998b ) .",
    "clearly , a larger sample of resolved disks is required to confirm this trend .",
    "the failure of our basic model to fit the sed of @xmath0  eriis extremely interesting , and it s important to determine what is causing the poor fit .",
    "there are essentially two possibilities : either there is an unknown physical effect which is modifying the size distribution in the particular case of @xmath0  eri , or else the size distribution model we have assumed is intrinsically wrong .",
    "@xmath0  eriis known to have a planet ( hatzes et  al .",
    "2000 ) , with a semi - major axis of 3.4 au and a mass of around 2  jupiter masses ( assuming an inclination of @xmath52 as measured by greaves et  al . ,",
    "this planet in unlikely to affect the dust size distribution at 60  au , because of its small orbital radius .",
    "however , a planet with a large semi - major axis has been inferred from the existence of clumps within the dust disk ( quillen & thorndike 2002 ) .",
    "if this planet is real , then dynamical effects are clearly very important in shaping the disk , and this would undoubtedly affect the size distribution of the dust ( wyatt 2003 , submitted ) .",
    "the alternative explanation is that the discrepancy is not due to an external influence , but that a more accurate treatment of the dust grain size distribution in a collisional cascade is needed to account for the sed .",
    "more detailed size distribution models allow the grain strength to vary with grain size , and account for the the effects of removing small grains on the overall size distribution ( campo bagatin et  al .",
    "1994 ; durda & dermott 1997 ) . for @xmath2  pic ,",
    "extensive numerical models of this type have been produced , both for the inner disk ( th ' ebault , augereau & beust , submitted ) and for the outer disk ( krivov , mann & krivova 2000 ) .",
    "both of these studies show significant deviation from the theoretical size distribution used in this paper .",
    "this suggests that a more rigorous treatment of the collisional cascade in @xmath0  eriwould also give a significantly different size distribution .",
    "however , it is not obvious that this would produce a better fit to the sed ( i.e.  that the new size distribution would have few grains smaller than 3  @xmath12 ) .",
    "in fact , according to ( 1994 ) we should expect an enhancement of grains just above the blowout radius as they are less likely to be destroyed by collisions , which would make the problem worse .",
    "conversely , the modelling of @xmath2  pic s outer disk by ( 2000 ) suggests a reduction in the number of grains just above the blowout limit , because they are destroyed by small , fast moving grains as they are ejected from the system by radiation pressure .",
    "however , as the stellar luminosity is much lower for @xmath0  eri , this mechanism is likely to be less important . only detailed modelling specific to @xmath0",
    "eri s dust disk can answer this question .",
    "the new sub - mm data significantly expands the sample of true vega excess stars detected at this wavelength . regardless of the dust properties , we are able to distinguish between a disk morphology and a ring morphology . out of the five new objects ,",
    "only hd109085 is disk like , indicating that this type is less common than the ring like structure observed around fomalhaut and @xmath0  eri .",
    "one of the main aims of this work was to determine the size of an unresolved disk from just its sed .",
    "however , the modelling of resolved targets has shown that this may not be possible .",
    "the large diversity in dust properties for the resolved disks mean that we can not make a reliable assumption as to the composition of the grains in an unresolved disk .",
    "in addition , the poor fit to @xmath0  eri s sed shows that the model may not in general contain all of the physics necessary to account for the observations .",
    "our estimates of the disk size are based on assumption that the dust grains are solid ( as for fomalhaut ) , but if the grain properties are different , then the size estimates will be incorrect .",
    "future progress in this field depends on spatially resolving disks , as this allows a direct measure of disk size and thus measurements of the dust composition .",
    "our results indicate that there are probably a few more targets that can be resolved using scuba , given sufficient integration time .",
    "also , ground based mid - ir observations also have the ability to resolve some disks .",
    "however , large numbers of resolved disks may have to wait until sirtf and sofia become available .",
    "we have presented new observations and modelling of vega excess disks with sub - mm data .",
    "our observations expand the sample of vega excess stars detected in the sub - mm from 5 to  10 , with a further 4  objects which were not detected but have useful upper limits .",
    "we have fitted the observed seds with models based on realistic dust grain composition and size distribution .",
    "we find that dust grain composition varies significantly between different objects , with younger disks having more porous grains .",
    "for @xmath0  eri , our model fails to fit the data unless there are less small grains in the system than expected from a collisional cascade .",
    "this discrepancy may be due to an inadequacy in our model of the size distribution , or the result of an external influence such as a planet .",
    "for the unresolved targets , disk size is estimated assuming solid dust grains , but given the observed diversity in dust composition and the problems fitting @xmath0  eri , these size estimates may not be reliable .",
