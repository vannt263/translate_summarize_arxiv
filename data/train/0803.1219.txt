    "section  [ sec : con ] supplies a conclusion and an outlook .",
    "we consider a high finesse cavity with two perfectly reflecting fixed end mirrors , and a partially reflective movable middle mirror as shown in fig.1 .    the middle mirror is assumed to execute small harmonic oscillations @xmath0 about its equilibrium position .",
    "it couples dissipatively ( linearly in @xmath0 ) to a cavity mode @xmath1 of frequency @xmath2 and dispersively ( quadratically in @xmath0 ) to a second mode @xmath3 of frequency @xmath4 .",

    "the first two terms in the hamiltonian @xmath5 describe the energies of the optical modes , the next two the energy of the oscillating mirror , and the last two the dissipative and dispersive coupling energies .",
    "the bosonic modes obey the commutation relations @xmath26=1 $ ] and @xmath27=1 $ ] , and the dynamical variables of the oscillating mirror follow the canonical commutation relation @xmath28=i\\hbar$ ] .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hq ] ) indicates that for low values of @xmath29 the spring potential energy dominates the anti - trapping due to radiation pressure , hence the middle mirror still behaves as a harmonic oscillator , but of lower frequency .",
    "however , for @xmath30 increasing @xmath31 leads to a point @xmath32 where the mirror behaves as a free particle . for even higher values of @xmath31 radiation pressure - induced anti - trapping dominates and the mirror behaves like an inverted harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "we do not consider that regime in this paper .",
    "this is consistent with the assumption of small mirror displacements @xmath0 used to derive the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hsc ] ) , as well as with requirements of stability .    in the following we consider a semiclassical version of the hamiltonian @xmath5 valid for situations where",
    "the optical modes can be treated classically . in that case @xmath33 and expressing the mirror displacement in terms of raising and lowering operators @xmath34 we have @xmath35 where we have removed a constant energy @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the semiclassical hamiltonian @xmath38 we have also introduced the operators @xmath39 which together with @xmath40 and @xmath41 form the basis of the so - called two - photon lie algebra @xcite , with @xmath42&= & \\pm k_\\pm , \\,\\,\\,\\ ,      \\left [ k_- , k_+\\right ] = 2 k_0 ,   \\nonumber \\\\      \\left [ k_-,c \\right ] & = & \\left [ k_+,c^\\dagger\\right ] = 0 , \\nonumber \\\\      \\left [ k_-,c^\\dagger \\right ] & = & c , \\,\\,\\,\\ ,      \\left [ k_0,c^\\dagger \\right ] = c^\\dagger/2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as is well known , the operators @xmath43 and @xmath44 form two sub - algebras , the associated operators forming the generators of coherent states and of squeezed states , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hsc ] ) has previously been studied in some detail in the context of molecular translational - vibrational interactions @xcite and laser - plasma scattering @xcite and very recently in the context of atomic vapors inside resonators @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for additional discussions of this model .",

    "( [ eq : chi ] ) quantifies the mismatch from the condition @xmath54 [ eq .  [ eq : crit ] ] which demarcates the regimes of qualitatively different physical behaviors in the system . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : complexnu ] ) and  ( [ eq : chi ] ) @xmath55 can both increase or decrease the characteristic time scale of the displacement as well as its magnitude .",
    "the displacement in phase space is given by the absolute value of @xmath56 .",
    "a plot of @xmath57 versus time for typical experimental parameters is shown in fig.[fig : displace ] .",
    "near the first minimum i.e. for @xmath58 the displacement is linear in time to lowest order , i.e. @xmath59 + \\mathcal{o}\\left[t^5\\right ] \\right|,\\ ] ] and the effects of squeezing come in at third order .",
    "interestingly , by adjusting the squeezing such that @xmath60 , which is still in the @xmath61 regime , the third - order time dependence of the displacement can be removed .",
    "qualitatively similar behavior can be seen near every minimum in fig .",
    "[ fig : displace ] .",
    "we note that in the absence of squeezing @xmath53 , @xmath62 while for large squeezing @xmath63 , @xmath64 for typical parameters we have @xmath65 .",
    "therefore for both small and large squeezing a coherent mechanical state of the middle mirror of relatively large amplitude can be produced starting from the ground state .",
    "returning to the various components of the evolution operator @xmath66 we observe that @xmath67 is a rotation operator , and @xmath68 is a squeezing operator , with @xmath69 as expected that operator does not depend on @xmath70 , i.e. displacement does not affect squeezing .",
    "it turns out that the rotation angle @xmath71 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rot ] ) is exactly opposite the angle at which the squeeze operator tilts the error ellipse of the moving mirror in phase space @xcite , i.e. @xmath72.\\ ] ] the two rotations therefore cancel each other out and @xmath71 effectively plays no role in the dynamics .",
    "it is in fact intuitively clear that the effects of rotation should cancel out , i.e. the axes of the final error ellipse should be aligned along @xmath73 and @xmath0 in phase space .",
    "this is because eq .",
    "( [ eq : hq ] ) stipulates that position is the only quadrature of the oscillating middle mirror that can be squeezed or anti - squeezed , the latter situation corresponding to momentum squeezing .",
    "figure  [ fig : squeeze ] shows @xmath74 versus time for typical experimental parameters .    as can be seen from that plot the squeezing first grows linearly in time .",
    "this can be confirmed by analytically expanding eq .",
    "[ eq : modkappa ] for the case of @xmath75 @xmath76+\\mathcal{o}\\left[t^5\\right]\\right|.\\ ] ] we note that the third - order time dependence can be removed for @xmath77 . actually under this condition it can readily be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : modkappa ] ) that all higher orders vanish and squeezing is purely linear in time : @xmath78 .",
    "however that case corresponds to @xmath79 , a situation where the mirror does not behave as a bound harmonic oscillator .",
    "if the middle mirror is prepared in its quantum mechanical ground state , the squeezing operator  ( [ eq : skappa ] ) produces a squeezed vacuum @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig : squeeze ] , the maximum value of @xmath80 is approximately 4 , which implies a maximum squeezing of @xmath81 , or log@xmath82db of squeezing .",
    "however the placement of a macroscopic nano - oscillator in its ground state has not yet been achieved experimentally , so we also consider thermal states of the middle mirror .",
    "they are characterized by a thermal phonon number given by the bose distribution @xmath83^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the mirror equilibrium temperature and @xmath85 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "any realistic model should also include the damping of the mirror .",
    "we estimate these effects by including noise and damping in the heisenberg equations of the mirror in a manner consistent with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "this produces the corresponding quantum langevin equations from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hq ] ) in a standard way .",
    "setting @xmath86 for simplicity and concentrating therefore solely on the squeezing part of the hamiltonian @xmath38 the quantum langevin equations turn out to be @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the damping constant of the mirror and @xmath89 represents brownian noise with average zero and fluctuations correlated as @xmath90 .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a high mechanical quality factor , the brownian force becomes delta - correlated in the time domain @xcite . in fourier space the correlation can then be written as @xmath91 by setting the time derivatives equal to zero the steady - state solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : qle ] ) can easily be found to be @xmath92 linearizing all operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qle ] ) as sums of a semiclassical steady - state value and a small quantum fluctuation ( i.e. @xmath93 ) we obtain linear dynamical equations for the fluctuations . using fourier transforms and eq .",
    "( [ eq : fcorr ] ) we can solve the fluctuation equations to obtain @xmath94 , etc .",
    "we can therefore also find the ( equal - time ) correlation function for the position @xmath95 which is independent of time since the noise process we have considered is stationary [ eq .  ( [ eq : brownian ] ) ] .",
    "this result for the position uncertainty has followed from a linear response analysis , however it agrees to first order with results from more sophisticated computations @xcite .",
    "for example in the absence of squeezing @xmath53 , and at high temperatures , @xmath96 , @xmath97 on the other hand for @xmath98 and low temperatures @xmath99 , @xmath100 which is just the square of the oscillator length of the ground state of the moving mirror . the results in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hot ] ) and  ( [ eq : cold ] ) agree with an earlier and more rigorous derivation @xcite . using eq .",
    "( [ fluctuations ] ) in the presence of squeezing @xmath101 and defining a position uncertainty @xmath102 in terms of the ground state oscillator length we find @xmath103^{1/2 } \\sim \\left(\\frac{k_b t_{e}}{\\hbar c_s } \\right)^{1/2},\\ ] ] where the last expression has been written in the limit of high temperature and high squeezing .",
    "@xmath102 needs to be lower than 1 for squeezing to be present , i.e. the fluctuations in the position need to be smaller than the ground state uncertainty in position . for millikelvin temperatures and hundreds of milliwatts of laser power , @xmath104 and about 8db of mechanical squeezing can be obtained , which is still considerable .",
    "in conclusion we have considered a partially reflective vibrating mirror coupled dispersively to an optical mode of a high finesse cavity .",
    "we have shown that quantum squeezing of the mechanical motion of the mirror can be achieved in this way .",
    "we have described the unitary dynamics of the oscillator in some detail and shown that the squeezing remains non - negligible in the presence of noise and damping .",
    "clearly the squeezing field itself can be employed in a time - dependent fashion although we have not investigated such a scenario .",
    "it was also shown that the oscillator can be displaced by a second field to which it is coupled dissipatively .",
    "the dynamics of the displacement can be influenced by the squeezing field , although the converse is not true .",
    "it would be interesting to explore the effects of the fully quantum mechanical hamiltonian [ eq .  ( [ eq : hq ] ) ] without making the semiclassical approximation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : semic ] ) .",
    "this may lead to highly non - classical states of the mirror - field system as found in the case of purely dissipative coupling @xcite .",
    "we are currently also working on generalizing the present proposal to the case of multiple mirrors in the same cavity .",
