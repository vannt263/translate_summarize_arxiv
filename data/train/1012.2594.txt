    ", we consider an initial distribution of particles @xmath30 .",
    "the dynamics of the uncoupled particles model ( [ eq : energy ] ) is such that particles in a given energy shell @xmath31 $ ] keep moving inside that shell , eventually reaching a homogeneous distribution within it . as a result",
    ", the system attains the following steady state distribution @xmath32 for simplicity , we present below the analysis for the often studied _ waterbag _ initial condition @xmath33 in order to evaluate @xmath34 , it is convenient to first consider the energy distribution @xmath35 . for the waterbag initial state ( [ eq : wb ] ) it is given by @xmath36 carrying out the integral over @xmath37 , one gets @xmath38 for @xmath39 and zero outside this range .",

    "we now use these results in order to probe the steady states of the hmf model , where the particles are now interacting . for the distribution ( [ eq : distr1 ] ) to be a stationary state of the corresponding hmf model one has to demand that the steady state magnetization of the model with non interacting particles satisfies @xmath69 @xcite , where @xmath70 the strategy we propose is to solve the above self - consistency equation in @xmath25 and then substitute the selected value of @xmath25 into eq .  ( [ eq : distr1 ] ) to get the steady state distributions , not only of the uncoupled system but also of the hmf .",
    "this is the main result of this paper . in applying these results to the hmf model",
    ", it is assumed that the magnetization takes its steady state value instantaneously at @xmath71 .",
    "this is of course not correct since the magnetization evolves towards its steady state value on a finite time scale , during which the momentum distribution also changes .",
    "thus the correspondence between the initial state and the steady state distribution is only approximate.this approximations works well for some initial conditions and not so well for others , as discussed below .",
    "we proceed by solving the self - consistency equation ( [ eq : self ] ) . for all @xmath72 and at small @xmath25",
    "the leading term in the marginal @xmath73 behaves like @xmath74 .",

    "the integration on both the first and the second domain displays a @xmath74 behavior and the first integral can be explicitly computed , giving @xmath78 .",
    "the third integral gives an order @xmath79 contribution . when computing @xmath80 in formula ( [ eq : self ] ) the first and second integral contribute terms that are opposite in sign for large enough @xmath59 and do not cancel each other .",
    "when @xmath59 reaches @xmath60 the @xmath74 terms cancel , giving rise in this limit to an order @xmath25 global contribution ( we give below explicitly the result for @xmath81 ) . because of the @xmath74 behavior , the @xmath82 solution is always unstable .",
    "therefore the magnetization is expected to be non zero at any value of @xmath50 @xcite .",
