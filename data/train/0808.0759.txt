    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mean eddington ratios adopted in our calculations are derived from an agn sample , which are in the range of @xmath89 .",

    "we also use the hard x - ray lf derived from an agn sample at high redshifts by @xcite in stead of the bolometric lf of @xcite in the calculations .",

    "<S> the comparison of the black hole mass function ( bhmf ) of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) relics with the measured mass function of the massive black holes in galaxies provides strong evidence for the growth of massive black holes being dominated by mass accretion . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the eddington ratio distributions as functions of black hole mass and redshift from a large agn sample with measured eddington ratios given by kollmeier et al . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , even at the low mass end , most black holes are accreting at eddington ratio @xmath0 , which implies that the objects accreting at extremely high rates should be rare or such phases are very short . </S>",
    "<S> using the derived eddington ratios , we explore the cosmological evolution of massive black holes with an agn bolometric luminosity function ( lf ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the resulted bhmf of agn relics is unable to match the measured local bhmf of galaxies for any value of ( constant ) radiative efficiency @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by volonteri , sikora & lasota s study on the spin evolution of massive black holes , we assume the radiative efficiency to be dependent on black hole mass , i.e. , @xmath1 is low for @xmath2 and it increases with black hole mass for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the bhmf of agn relics can roughly reproduce the local bhmf of galaxies if @xmath4 for @xmath5 and it increases to @xmath6 for @xmath7 , which implies that most massive black holes ( @xmath8 ) are spinning very rapidly .
