    "there are quantum mechanical problems in which the hamiltonian depends explicitly on time , for example , the interaction of the system with an external time - dependent field where @xmath0 . in such cases ,",
    "the system does not remain in any stationary state , and the behavior of it is governed by the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath1 the problem will now be an initial - value ( cauchy ) problem of solving this partial differential equation for a prescribed initial condition at @xmath2 . when problems of this short are discussed formally , it is common to speak of the perturbation ( @xmath3 ) as causing _ transitions _ between eigenstates of @xmath4 . if this statement is interpreted to mean that the state has changed from its inital value to a final value , than it is incorrect .",
    "the effect of a time - dependent perturbation is to produce a nonstationary state , rather than to cause a jump from one stationary state to another which were determined by considering boundary conditions solely .    experiments open the possibility to investigate dynamical properties of confined systems . in that field , of particular interest",
    "is the response of the system to time - dependent variations of the confining field .",
    "then , even assuming complete isolation of the many - body confined system from the environment , there is the question of how the correlation properties change",
    ". furthermore , one can consider an atom in its ground state .",
    "if at times @xmath5 it becomes subject to a time - varying potential energy caused by a charged heavy projectile passing by , its electron cloud will be shaken up so that its energy increases .",
    "the energy change , related to the stopping power , is a measurable quantity .",
    "however , when we have shake - up processes , the application of one - particle auxiliary pictures is not necessarily useful _ a priori_.    motivated by such problems , in this work we consider a simplified interacting model system introduced by heisenberg @xcite in the early days of quantum mechanics @xmath6 where @xmath7}$ ] measures the strength of repulsive interparticle interaction .",
    "we will use ideas and methods @xcite for solving the quantum motion of a particle in a harmonic oscillator with time - dependent frequency , by adding a quadrupolar ( @xmath8 ) time - dependent perturbation , of @xmath9 character , to the above ground - state hamiltonian @xmath10 in the field of heavy - particle interaction with atoms , such term could mimic the shake - up process due to close encounters . there , as was stressed @xcite by fermi , quantum mechanics",
    "is needed since bohr s classical treatment is valid @xcite only for dipolar perturbation .",
    "one might think that a two - particle model is a bit trivial to test time - dependent many - body methods .",
    "but , this is not the case .",
    "indeed , it is the few - body correlated dynamics that serve @xcite as benchmark for methods beyond , for instance , time dependent density functional theory , td - dft .",
    "furthermore , to the theory of breathing modes of many - body systems in harmonic confinement , it was utilized @xcite to replace a given ( say , with coulombic interparticle interaction ) hamiltonian with a quadratic hamiltonian for which an analytic solution exist .",
    "a mapping at the hamiltonian level could be a practical version of the isospectral deformation discussed earlier @xcite in the light of the , unfortunately , formal character of pure existence theorems and mapping lemmas behind td - dft .",
    "we believe that experience about relevant details in interacting systems is best governed by studying time - dependent quantities based on exactly solvable instructive examples .",
    "in particular , the simultaneous treatment of the notorious kinetic and interparticle energy components could be more accurate than in td - dft where both are approximated .",
    "besides , our result allows a transparent implementation of the mapping - formalism @xcite designed to construct independent - particle potentials ( and to discuss @xcite an alarming paradox arising there ) by using exact probabilistic quantities of the correlated model as inputs .    as a last motivation",
    ", we note that there have been efforts to clarify the basic relations between interparticle correlation and information - theoretic measures for entanglement .",
    "for instance , the stationary ground - state of the correlated model applied in the present work has already been investigated in this respect . a surprising duality between rnyi s entropies characterizing entangled systems , with attractive ( @xmath11 ) and repulsive interparticle interactions",
    "was found @xcite and explained @xcite recently .",
    "the question of how such a remarkable duality will change when the correlated system is perturbed by a time - dependent external field is an exciting one of broad relevance .",
    "one of our goals here is to provide an answer .",
    "we stress that we restrict ourselves to the linear - response limit , by taking our @xmath12 sufficiently small or sudden , since the main goal is on the time - dependent spectral aspects of correlation - dynamics and not on comparison with data .",
    "however , we should note that similarly to the born series of stationary scattering theory , an order - by - order expansion could result in only an asymptotic series .",
    "indeed , higher - order response to external field is an important topic in the energy change during shake - up dynamics of a nucleus @xcite or an atom @xcite . the idea that by renormalization of the kinetic energy one could @xcite extend the validity of linear - response formalism is also a challenging one .",
    "such questions need accurate solutions in linear and nonlinear responses .",
    "the nonlinear version of the exact determination of energy changes in our correlated model system will be published separately .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii contains our theoretical results .",
    "section iii is devoted to a short summary and few relevant comments .",
    "we will use natural , rather than atomic , units in this work , except where the opposite is explicitly stated .",
    "by introducing the normal coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath14 , one can easily rewrite @xcite the unperturbed hamiltonian in the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the resulting independent - mode frequencies .",
    "it is this separated form which shows that a time - dependent perturbation of dipolar character , @xmath18\\ , x_1 $ ] , will couple only to one normal mode characterized by the unperturbed angular frequency @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , such perturbation @xcite produces an energy change independent of the correlated aspect of our model .    in the case",
    "investigated here , we have @xmath20 , i.e. , there is time - dependent quadrupolar perturbation in both independent normal modes , which will evolve in time independently .",
    "thus , we proceed by one oscillator [ @xmath21 in a time - dependent harmonic confinement , following the established theoretical path , where one has to solve a time - dependent schrdinger equation , of the form given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , with @xmath22 the solution rests on making proper changes of the time and distance scales @xcite in order to consider frequency variations in @xmath23 as it changes from @xmath24 during time - evolution .",

    "remarkably , eq . ( 8) shows transparently that the breathing frequency @xcite is precisely @xmath41 , i.e. , the double of the confinement frequency characterizing the ground - state mode of the unperturbed @xmath42 .    once an explicit form for @xmath43 is prescribed to be used in both ( @xmath44 ) differential equations for @xmath45 [ considering the two independent _ modes _ , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 and the solutions for @xmath48 are found , the time - dependent wave function becomes @xmath49 which is valid for @xmath50 , and to which the form for @xmath51 is given by eq .",

    "its product form reflects the independence of two normal modes during propagation .",
    "when we are close to the stability limit at @xmath63 , even a weak external field could result in an almost perfect orthogonality at certain , @xmath43-dependent , time @xmath5 .",
    "now , we turn to quantities which show explicitly the entangled nature of the correlated two - particle system in the time domain . by rewriting the wave function in terms of original coordinates , we determine the reduced single - particle density matrix [ @xmath64 from @xmath65 after a long , but straightforward , calculation we obtain @xmath66 where , for further clarifications below , we introduced the following abbreviations @xmath67^{1/4}\\ , e^{-\\frac{m}{2\\hbar}\\omega_s(t)\\ , x^2[1-i\\ , \\alpha(t)/\\omega_s(t)]},\\ ] ] @xmath68\\ ] ] @xmath69 ^ 2 + [ \\dot{r}_1(\\omega_1,t)/r_1(\\omega_1,t ) - \\dot{r}_2(\\omega_2,t)/r_2(\\omega_2,t)]^2 } { \\omega_1(t)+\\omega_2(t)}\\ ] ] with @xmath70 $ ] , where @xmath71 ^ 2 $ ] .",

    "i.e. , neglecting the important role of the interparticle coordinate , we can define an auxiliary independent - particle model , where the particles move in a _ certain _ external field .",
    "the wave function of this modeling becomes @xmath79 this approximate state will still result in the exact probability density and exact probability current , by construction .",

    "at least upto a time - dependent constant @xcite . in the so - called adiabatic treatment in td - dft ,",
    "one uses @xcite only the first term as a time - dependent external field .",
    "but , with such a single - particle potential , which produces from a time - dependent wave equation the @xmath82 state , we also arrive at a dilemma .",
    "we know the exact schrdinger hamiltonian .",
    "especially , we know how the unperturbed hamiltonian is modified by adding a time - dependent quadrupolar perturbation to it . furthermore , since the perturbation acts only over a limited time in our problem , in the schrdinger picture we can follow the standard quantum mechanical prescription to determine the energy change by calculating expectation values with the exact wave function @xmath83 and unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath84 . in the light of @xmath85 $ ] , the situation in the orbital version of td - dft is not so clear .",
    "for instance , it will contain a @xmath86-proportional higher - order derivative @xcite . quite unfortunately , in td - dft , which is based @xcite on a density - potential mapping lemma , we do not @xcite know universal functionals to determine an energy change via them .",
    "after the above remarks on open questions in applied dt - dft , and motivated partly by dreizler s early suggestion @xcite on using an isospectral deformation ( @xmath87 ) and a constrained search , we turn to the decomposition of our reduced one - particle density matrix , and , in addition , put forward an idea on the possibility of using an _ approximate _",

    "following our experience @xcite on the decomposition of the stationary @xmath89 , we will use mehler s formula @xcite now to @xmath90 .",

    "however , even by these extracted quantities one can calculate the exact kinetic , and the external - potential energies , respectively , while in td - dft only the last energy is , in principle , exact .",
    "thus , to formulate an idea , which is based on inversion from _ known _ probability density @xmath100 and probability current @xmath74 ( i.e. , from the crucial @xcite @xmath103 phase ) , we make a rewriting @xmath104[z(t)]^l    [ 1-z_d(t)][z_d(t)]^l|\\phi_l[x , t,\\omega_d(t)]|^{2},\\ ] ] which is valid if and only if @xmath105/[1-z_d(t)]$ ] .",
    "so , with one - particle probabilistic functions as input , we can prescribe , from the r.h.s .",
    "of the above equation , a trace - conserving @xmath88 which has the form of @xmath90 .",
    "such nonidempotent form contains two ( interconnected ) parameters @xmath106 and @xmath107 , instead of the uniquely derived @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "whether this deformed one - matrix could result in , because of its _ tunable _ flexibility , an essentially better approximation for the kinetic energy than the td - dft [ @xmath108 where the one - matrix is idempotent , requires future investigations within the framework of a constrained search @xcite .",
    "the information - theoretic aspects of iterparticle interaction , i.e. , of a crucial term in the hamiltonian , may be considered via entropic measures which do not use expectation values with physical dimensions but use pure probabilities encoded in the occupation numbers @xmath109\\ , [ z(t)]^l},\\ ] ] which are , in the present case , time - dependent quantities as well .",
    "first , we calculate rnyi s entropy @xcite , with @xmath110 and @xmath111 , from @xmath112^q}{1-[z(t)]^q}}.\\ ] ] the von neumann entropy is obtained as a limiting case when @xmath113 .",

    "notice , that the knowledge of rnyi entropies for arbitrary values of @xmath118 provides , mainly from information - theoretic point of view , more information than the von neumann entropy alone , since one could extract @xcite from them the full spectrum of the one - matrix .",
    "but , as eq .",
    "( 26 ) shows transparently , to physical expectation values one also needs the proper basis set .",
    "armed the above , strongly interrelated , theoretical details on the dynamics of interparticle correlation we come to their implementation .",
    "we use a simple model for illustration , with @xmath119 . by tuning the value of the effective rate of change ( denoted by @xmath120 ) we can easily investigate the sudden and adiabatic limits .",

    "as expected on physical grounds , the change at long time , i.e. , taking @xmath128 first , becomes a constant which tends to zero in the @xmath129 sudden limit . in the long - time limit the overlap parameter of eq .",
    "( 13 ) , which measures the time - evolution of orthogonality between exact states , also tends to a constant value .",

    "two options are analyzed here , and a remarkable result is found , as figure 1 signals .",
    "namely , with @xmath133 , i.e. , with the density - optimal modeling , the corresponding energy _ change _ tends to the exact one at high enough values of @xmath120 , since @xmath134 .",

    "we have checked , using both sides of eq .",

    "also in bohr s pioneering modeling @xcite with time - dependent dipole fields of a passing charge , the time - scale derived above using collision theory , could play a more quantitative role to understand fine details behind experimental predictions @xcite on energy losses of slow ions in insulators .",
    "furthermore , in the renewed field of time - dependent energy losses , a proper time - scale also could help to analyze further a remarkable theoretical prediction @xcite on the strong interplay of nuclear and electronic stopping components of the observable total energy transfer .",
    "indeed , few - electron shake - up processes can be dominant at close encounters in condensed matter . in such dynamical cases , one - electron approximations , with double - occupancy for an auxiliary spatial orbital , could result in inaccuracies .",

    "<S> time - dependent quantities are calculated in the linear response limit for a correlated one dimensional model atom driven by an external quadrupolar time - dependent field . besides the analysis of the time - evolving energy change in the correlated two - particle system , and orthogonality of initial and final states , mehler s formula is applied in order to derive a point - wise decomposition of the time - dependent one - matrix in terms of time - dependent occupation numbers and time - dependent orthonormal , natural orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> based on such exact spectral decomposition on the time domain , rnyi s entropy is also investigated . </S>",
    "<S> considering the structure of the exact time - dependent one - matrix , an independent - particle model is defined from it which contains exact information on the single - particle probability density and probability current . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting noninteracting auxiliary state is used to construct an effective potential and discuss its applicability . </S>"
