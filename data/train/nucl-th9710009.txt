    "the two - body spectator ( or gross ) equations were first introduced in 1969 and have been developed in a number of subsequent papers @xcite .",
    "the treatment of electromagnetic interactions in this context has also been studied @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , all of these previous treatments have been largely based on the analysis of feynman diagrams , and the equations have been largely derived from this diagrammatic analysis . in this paper",
    "we present an algebraic derivation of the equations which is complementary to previous diagrammatic derivations .",
    "more specifically , we develop a new operator algebra which involves some non - associative rules for the treatment of products of singular operators .",
    "once this operator algebra has been carefully defined and developed , it provides a powerful tool for the formal manipulation of the equations and permits a careful and detailed comparison with the bethe - salpeter equations .",
    "it also alows us to derive several new results which would be difficult to derive using a purely diagrammatic approach . in applications the relativistic kernel for either the bethe - salpeter equation or the gross equation",
    "is usually expanded in a perturbation series , and in this paper we obtain , for the first time , the form of the electromagnetic current operator for the gross equation which is valid to all orders in this expansion .",
    "we also show explicitly that the theory conserves the charge of a bound state , and that gauge invariance is _ exactly _ preserved when the theory is truncated to any finite order , provided only that the strong kernel and the electromagnetic current operator are both truncated to the same finite order .",
    "this work is a continuation of recent work @xcite in which the normalization condition for the three - body vertex function was derived , and also lays the foundation for extension of recent developments of the three - body gross equations by stadler and gross @xcite .",
    "the new algebra developed in this paper will be used to derive , in this forthcoming paper , the electromagnetic current operator for the three - body gross equations @xcite , and we have developed the formalism here with an eye to this extension .",
    "spectator currents have also been independently discussed by kvinikhidze and blankleider @xcite .",
    "their discussion is more limited in scope than ours ( here we develop an operator algebra , discuss the connection with the bethe - salpeter equation , and obtain results to all orders ) , but the results they do obtain agree with us ( see the discussion in sec .",
    "iii below ) .",
    "a number of other works deriving the electromagnetic current for various relativistic equations have appeared recently .",
    "coester and riska have derived the current operator for the blankenbecler - sugar equation @xcite and devine and wallace @xcite and phillips and wallace @xcite have discussed the construction of a current operator for use with a relativistic version of the equal time equation .",

    "iv we present the final form for the currents and show that the currents appropriate for identical and nonidentical particles are equivalent . we also show that the exact results in the two formalisms ( bs and spectator ) are identical if both are calculated to all orders .",

    "identical particles will be discussed later .      in order to introduce the singular operators needed for our discussion and to derive their non - associative operator algebra , we first review the procedure used to motivate the rearrangement of the multiple scattering series which leads to the gross equation .",

    "this will be obtained from the five - point propagator as in our discussion of the bs equation .",

    "= 1.5 in    the location of the 10 poles in the energy loop integral is shown in fig .",
    "[ contour_photon ] .",
    "since there are now two propagators for particle 1 in the loop , there are two positive energy poles for particle 1 labeled @xmath52 and @xmath114 corresponding to the two propagators . if the contour is closed in the lower half - plane as shown in fig .",
    "[ contour_photon ] , the contour integral therefore contains two contributions corresponding to placing particle 1 on shell either before or after the photon absorption .",
    "the separation of propagators in the presence of the single nucleon current operator is then illustrated by the contour integrals displayed in fig .",
    "[ contour_photon2 ] . for spin 1/2 particles ,",
    "the contour integral is decomposed into three terms @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are operators corresponding to the particle exchanges which occur before and after the interaction , @xmath118 with @xmath119 , and the last term is the remainder of the @xmath120 integration coming from all of the poles _ except _ @xmath52 and @xmath114 .",
    "note that the singularities which appear in the first two terms after the integration _ cancel _ as @xmath121 and that therefore the @xmath122 prescriptions have been dropped from the propagators .",
    "in algebraic form this decomposition can be written    = 2.5 in    @xmath123 where the @xmath124 brackets indicate that only one loop integration is present even though there are two operators @xmath125 .",
    "note that the expression ( [ g_1jg_1sep ] ) does _ not _ contain the term @xmath126 which might be expected if the decomposition ( [ g_1sep ] ) were blindly inserted into @xmath127 . in order to obtain such a term the contour integration would have to pick up the two poles at @xmath52 and @xmath128 _ simultaneously _ , which is clearly impossible .",
    "the only sense in which the contour integration might seem to pick up these two poles simultaneously is when they coalesce into a single _",
    "double _ pole , which can occur for certain values of the external and internal loop momenta .",
    "however , even in these special cases the residue theorem @xmath129 = 2\\pi\\,i\\ , f'(z_0 ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] shows that the only contribution comes from the single poles which result from the laurent expansion of the integrand at the point @xmath130 ; there is no contribution from the double singularity itself . in our case ,",
    "when the two poles _ do _ coalesce , the combination of the first two terms on the rhs ( [ g_1jg_1sep ] ) gives the correct result by producing a derivative term ( similar to the @xmath131 term in the above example ) arising from the cancellation of the singular parts of each term .",
    "note that when the current couples to _ external _ lines , or when particle 1 is disconnected from the graph so that there is _ no loop integration involved _ , the term @xmath126 _ will _ be present .",
    "it vanishes only from internal loops .",
    "the relationship between various n - point functions as described in the bethe - salpeter formalism and the corresponding quantities for the gross equation can always be obtained by a similar procedure .",
    "that is , starting with the bethe - salpeter quantity :    1 .   identify all loops contributing to the n - point function .",
    "reduce all redundant products of one - body operators .",
    "for example in ( [ g_mubs ] ) use @xmath132 .",

    "replace the quantity @xmath133 using ( [ g_1jg_1sep ] ) .",
    "careful application of this procedure will always result in a correct expression for the gross n - point functions , and is straightforward when applied to the derivation of the gross five - point propagator .",
    "however , in the application to three body systems it is necessary to treat the six- and seven - point functions , and the task of identifying all possible configurations of loops in these cases is quite tedious . in this case",
    "the task is greatly simplified if we develop a few identities which are equivalent to introducing a non - associative algebra for the operators which occur in the spectator theory .",
    "these identities also simplify the discussion of two - body systems , and will therefore be developed now .",
    "the discussion of the application of these ideas to three - body systems is postponed for forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "since @xmath67 is very singular at the positive energy pole , considerable care must be taken in evaluating the product of this operator with other operators which may also be singular or vanishing at the pole position .",

    "<S> this paper presents a new non - associative algebra which is used to ( i ) show how the spectator ( or gross ) two - body equations and electromagnetic currents can be formally derived from the bethe - salpeter equation and currents if both are treated to all orders , ( ii ) obtain explicit expressions for the gross two - body electromagnetic currents valid to any order , and ( iii ) prove that the currents so derived are exactly gauge invariant when truncated consistently to _ any _ finite order . </S>",
