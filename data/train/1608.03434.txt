    "two - dimensional  ( 2d ) materials have been intensively investigated since the first successful isolation of graphene  @xcite .",
    "recently , this interest has been stimulated further by the discovery of the special properties of single - layer transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmdc )  @xcite .",
    "van - der - waals coupled 2d  materials now span the whole range from metallic over semiconducting up to isolating materials and their combination leads to fascinating opportunities for designing stacked heterostructures  @xcite .",
    "tmdc heterostructures have shown promise for various electronic applications , in particular optoelectronic devices , such as pn - diodes  @xcite , ( field - effect ) transitors  @xcite , photovoltaic cells and photodetectors  @xcite , light - emitting diodes  @xcite and nanolasers  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "future applications beyond conventional optoelectronics might be based on the coupled spin and valley physics of tmdc monolayers due to their broken inversion symmetry  @xcite .",
    "this coupling allows the excitation of specific spin carriers into a specific valley which has been demonstrated by optical pumping with circularly polarized light  @xcite .",
    "these findings pave the way for a new class of prospective devices called valleytronics .",
    "the energy alignment of tmdc heterostructures  @xcite as well as interlayer charge- and energy - transfer processes  @xcite are of particular interest in fundamental and applied research . due to the van - der - waals coupling",
    ", arbitrary layer stacking is possible .",
    "rotational misfit between two tmdc monolayers of a layered structure results in a corresponding rotation of the hexagonal brillouin zones of the two layers leading to momentum - mismatched interlayer excitations .",
    "therefore , the stacking influences charge and energy transfer and therby the performance of the device .",
    "it has been shown that the interlayer coupling of homo - stacked layers depends considerably on the respective stacking angles  @xcite and the same should hold for the coupling of hetero - bilayers  @xcite . indeed , a distinct difference in the exciton dynamics of coherently and randomly stacked heterostructures has been observed  @xcite .",
    "however , most of the present time - resolved studies on tmdc heterostructures do not discuss the stacking of their materials at all .",
    "furthermore , some studies report explicitly that their results do not depend on the relative orientation between the individual monolayers in the heterostructure  @xcite .    thus , systematic studies are highly needed to investigate how structural characteristics like the stacking angle of 2d  heterostructures correlate with other physical properties of the materials such as the existence and dynamics of charge transfer excitons . in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate that spatially resolved optical second - harmonic generation ( shg ) , i.e.  shg imaging microscopy , is a powerful experimental technique to perform such time - resolved studies in consideration of the material s structure .",
    "it allows to study systematically both the orientation and the charge carrier dynamics of tmdc monolayers and heterostructures with the same experimental setup .",
    "in particular , a complementary technique to analyze the stacking of the material is not needed . as an example",
    ", we report time - resolved shg imaging microscopy studies on mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 monolayer flakes grown by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) on a @xmath1  nm sio@xmath0/si(001 ) substrate .",
    "previous studies already demonstrated that second harmonic generation is a versatile technique to investigate single- and multilayers of tmdcs  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the sh response of the tmdcs exhibits a dramatic odd - even oscillation with the number of layers consistent with the absence ( presence ) of inversion symmetry in odd ( even ) layers  @xcite .",
    "rotational anisotropy shg measurements probing the sh response of tmdc monolayers as a function of the crystal orientation reveal the expected six - fold rotational symmetry  @xcite .",
    "this allows the determination of crystallographic orientations for single - layer flakes  @xcite , domain boundaries and orientations of cvd grown monolayer structures  @xcite as well as stacking angles of twisted bilayers  @xcite .",
    "time - resolved shg has also been applied to study the dynamics of various phenomena at surfaces and interfaces of bulk semiconductors .",
    "its sensitivity to symmetry changes and to interface electronic states has been exploited for time - domain investigations of phase transformations  @xcite , of adsorbate reactions  @xcite , of interface - specific electron dynamics  @xcite and to the detection of transient electric fields at interfaces  @xcite .",
    "one has to point out that the high sensitivity of shg to the discussed quantities allows one to explore very small effects .",
    "for example , coverage changes on surfaces of less than 1% of a monolayer may be detected by means of shg  @xcite .",
    "time - resolved shg experiments on tmdc samples have to cope with the small flake / domain size of exfoliated and cvd grown samples available at the moment .",
    "therefore , almost all previous optical experiments were performed at normal incidence by means of microscope objectives(@xmath2 ) with short working distances and probe beams focused to @xmath3 .",
    "this kind of setup is disadvantageous for time - resolved pump - probe studies like shg because it makes the non - collinear incidence of pump and probe beam difficult .",
    "as the pump beam also generates sh signal , this has to be differentiated from the sh response of the probe beam .",
    "furthermore , the time - resolution is reduced by the dispersion of the used optical elements .",
    "these difficulties might explain why , to the best of our knowledge , there is only one published time - resolved shg study on tmdcs . here ,",
    "the dynamical sh response of single - layer mos@xmath0 to intense above - bandgap photoexcitation was investigated  @xcite .",
    "shg imaging microscopy combines the advantages of time - resolved shg with an optical microscopy setup .",
    "the sh response of the sample is imaged optically magnified on a ccd chip .",
    "similar setups have been used to study surface reactions like desorption or diffusion  @xcite as well as electric field distributions and carrier motion  @xcite .",
    "shg imaging microscopy copes with both of the discussed challenges of time - resolved studies on tmdcs . on the one hand ,",
    "the sh response of pump and probe beam can be separated very easily . on the other hand ,",
    "the time - resolution is virtually limited by the pulse duration of the laser system .",
    "the sh response of large sample areas ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) can be probed in a single shot without the need of any mapping or scanning . by means of polarization dependent measurements , the crystalline orientation of single - layer flakes and domains , or the stacking angles of heterostructures",
    "can be evaluated for the whole field of view .",
    "pump - probe experiments at the corresponding area then allow to correlate observed transient changes of the sh response with the underlying structure . with this technique polarization- and time - resolved measurements",
    "can be performed systematically and routinely .",
    "shg imaging microscopy is also suited to study fluence dependent phenomena  @xcite .",
    "the experiments were performed under ambient conditions using 40  fs laser pulses generated by a femtosecond ti : sapphire laser amplifier system ( coherent rega ) operating at 800  nm with a repetition rate of 100  khz .",
    "the main part of the amplifier output ( @xmath6 ) is used to pump a travelling - wave optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) operating in the visible range .",
    "the output of the opa is recompressed by a pair of lafn28 brewster prisms .",
    "this visible pump beam is then focussed under the angle of @xmath7 onto the sample as illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the remaining part of the amplifier output ( @xmath8 ) is focused on the sample under an angle of @xmath9 to probe the sh response . due to",

    "is used to pump an optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) generating visible pump pulses .",
    "the remaining part of the amplifier output is used to probe the sh response .",
    "pump and probe beam are focussed onto the sample under an angle of @xmath7 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the specular reflected sh light of the probe pulse is imaged optically magnified by a camera lens on the ccd camera .",
    "[ fig1 ] , width=325 ]    the specular reflected sh response of the probe beam is imaged optically magnified by a camera lens ( nikon nikkor , @xmath10  ed , @xmath11 ) on an electron - multiplied ccd chip ( princeton instruments proem - hs ) with a size of @xmath12  pixels ; each pixel covers an area of @xmath13  @xmath5 on the chip .",
    "the camera is sensitive in a spectral range from @xmath14 up to @xmath15 and was operated in full image mode .",
    "the used magnification was m@xmath16 , thus the visible sample region on the ccd was about @xmath17 .",
    "the overall resolution of our imaging microscopy setup is better than 4  @xmath18 as determined by a standard resolution target ( c.f .",
    "s3 in the supplemental material ( _ sm _ )  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the resolution is close to the diffraction limit of @xmath19 .",
    "the time - delay between pump and probe beam is varied by a motorized delay stage .",
    "the polarization of pump and probe beam can be varied by means of @xmath20-plates .",
    "the polarization of the second - harmonic response is analyzed by a combination of @xmath20-plate and analyzer .",
    "color filters for separation of both the incident @xmath21- and detected @xmath22-light have been used ( rg715 , fbh400 - 40 ) .",
    "the spot diameter of pump and probe beam on the sample [ full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) ] were @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "a combination of @xmath20-plate and polarizer enable the continuous variation of the incident pump fluences on the sample .",
    "the incident fluence of pump and probe beam was @xmath25 in each case .",
    "long term measurements with these fluences applied did not exhibit any multishot damage .",
    "the studied tmdc sample consists of mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 monolayer flakes which were cvd grown successively on the same @xmath1  nm sio@xmath0/si(001 ) substrate ( 2d semiconductors ) .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows an optical microscope image ( @xmath26 ) in comparison to the respective shg microscopy image ( p - polarized sh component , @xmath27 ) which is intensity - inverted for better comparability .",
    "one can identify several dark triangular flakes and some additional bulky flakes showing less contrast on the bright sio@xmath0/si(001 ) substrate . by means of photoluminescence measurements ( not shown ) the flakes have been identified as single - layer mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "previous rotational anisotropy measurements probing the sh radiation component parallel ( perpendicular ) to the polarization of the fundamental field revealed the expected @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) dependence  @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath30 denotes the angle between the mirror plane in the crystal structure ( i.e. the armchair direction ) and the polarization of the probe beam . rotating the sample",
    "then allows direct access to the symmetry of the sample and to the crystal orientation  @xcite .",
    "however , in order to exploit the advantage of shg imaging microscopy probing a larger surface area at once , the sample is chosen to be fixed and the polarization of the fundamental is rotated . as it is known from literature  @xcite and further derived in the _ sm _  @xcite ,",
    "the expected dependence of p- and s - polarized components of the sh intensity on the polarization yield @xmath31    here , @xmath32 denotes the angle of the polarization with respect to the horizontal and @xmath33 the angle between the armchair direction of the 2d - crystal and the horizontal as sketched in fig .  [ fig3](b ) .",
    "thus , instead of the six - fold rotational symmetry , a four - fold rotational symmetry is expected , but again the crystal orientation can be evaluated from the data .",
    "please note , that because of the threefold rotational symmetry of the tmdc monolayers , shg without phase information does not deduce opposite crystal orientations .",
    "consequently , it only determines domain orientations modulo @xmath34 .",
    "since the observed triangular mos@xmath0 flakes represent ideal orientation markers , the consistency of the evaluation can be checked easily ( cf . section  2 in the _ sm _  @xcite ) .",
    "a movie of the polarization dependent shg microscopy measurements showing the p - polarized sh component ( @xmath35 ) for varying polarization of the fundamental from @xmath36 to @xmath37 in steps of @xmath38 can be found in the _ sm _  @xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the corresponding polar plots of the sh intensity of some mos@xmath0  ( c ) and ws@xmath0  ( d ) regions marked in the shg microscopy image  ( a ) .",
    "as described above , the crystal orientations along the armchair direction of the three mos@xmath0 ( ws@xmath0 ) flakes are evaluated from the observed phase of the corresponding fits to @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath40 ) .",
    "a statistical analysis of 13  mos@xmath0 flakes finds that the orientations are distributed around @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( c.f . fig .",
    "s2 in the _ sm _",
    "this indicates a predominant growth direction of mos@xmath0 most - likely induced by the geometry of the substrate . for ws@xmath0 ,",
    "there were not enough monolayer flakes to perform a similar statistical analysis .",
    "furthermore , one finds that the amplitudes of the rotational anisotropy for the ws@xmath0 flakes differ strongly while the mos@xmath0 amplitudes are very similar .",
    "this indicates that the cvd growth conditions have led to much less uniform structures for the ws@xmath0 flakes on the sio@xmath0/si(001 ) substrate .",
    "this is in accordance with the observed bulky and inhomogeneous appearance of the ws@xmath0 flakes in optical microscopy .",
    "while the performed photoluminescence measurements clearly suggest single - layered ws@xmath0 , one might suspect a partial existence of ws@xmath0 multilayers .",
    "one has to point out that the determination of the crystal orientation or stacking angles by means of shg originates directly from the symmetry properties of the tmdc layers .",
    "neither a complementary experimental technique nor further modelling is needed for the evaluation .",
    "this is in contrast to similar considerations for graphene which is , by the way , not accessible by shg due to its inversion symmetry . instead",
    ", the stacking of bilayer graphene has been studied systematically for example by the combination of structural and optical experimental techniques like transmission electron microscopy and raman spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "the results of a time - resolved pump - probe experiment on the same surface area is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . the used pump - wavelength of 618  nm ( 2.01  ev ) was chosen to match the energies of the a - exciton of ws@xmath0 ( 1.95  ev ) and the b - exciton of mos@xmath0 ( 2.01  ev )  @xcite .",
    "while the observed transients of the two different materials show a similar and fast pump - induced decrease of the sh response , their subsequent relaxation differs considerably , but can be described by a bi - exponential behavior in each case .",
    "the averaged time - constants obtained from the corresponding fits yield @xmath45  fs and @xmath46  ps for mos@xmath0 and @xmath47  ps and @xmath48  ns for ws@xmath0 .",
    "we attribute the fast decrease of the sh response due to the pump - induced depopulation of the valence band associated with the excitation of excitons .",
    "the subsequent progression then is interpreted as exciton relaxation within the monolayer materials .",
    "since the mos@xmath0 values compare reasonably well with time - constants obtained from linear optical spectroscopy  @xcite , this assignment seems appropriate .",
    "however , the overall number and values of reported time - constants differ quite strongly within these studies .",
    "single-  @xcite , bi-  @xcite and tri-  @xcite exponential behavior has been reported . the value of the shortest time - constant ranges from 500  fs up to 100  ps and that of the longest time - constant from 15  ps up to 500  ps .",
    "similar variation holds for the reported studies on ws@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "these differences might be explained among other things by the use of different substrates , different temperatures , different pump- and probe energies and laser fluences , as well as varying sample quality , and of course , also by systematic effects of the applied techniques .",
    "furthermore , a correlation of the crystal orientation and the pump laser polarization might be possible .    from this lack of clarity for these quite simple 2d  monolayer systems , one might anticipate the complexity for 2d  heterostructures and corresponding devices .",
    "thus , systematic time - resolved studies on monolayer and heterostructure systems are mandatory in identifying the genuine physical effects and understanding the underlying mechanisms correlated to the layer stacking .",
    "consequently , this knowledge will facilitate the further development and improvement of prospective applications based on 2d  materials .",
    "the operation and performance of devices based on tmdc heterostructures strongly depend on the stacking of individual layers . concurrently , reported results of time - resolved optical spectroscopy on simple tmdc monolayer systems reveal a large variability .",
    "we have introduced shg imaging microscopy as a powerful method for the investigation of monolayers and heterostructures of two - dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides . in particular , it is suited to perform systematic pump - probe experiments and to correlate the observed transient changes of the second harmonic response to the stacking of the material . from polarization",
    "dependent measurements , the crystalline orientations of single - layer mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 flakes grown on sio@xmath0/si(001 ) are evaluated .",
    "time - resolved experiments exhibit a fast pump - induced decrease of the sh response in both materials while its relaxation differs considerably for mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 . from the corresponding time - constants the transient changes are attributed to the excitation and relaxation of excitons within the monolayer materials .",
