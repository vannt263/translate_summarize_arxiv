    "in @xcite , we introduced a renormalizable model of an extended color gauge sector which naturally address the experimental observation that the third family of quarks has only a small mixing with the lighter families , and which realizes next - to - minimal flavor violation .",
    "the color interactions are extended to an @xmath4 structure in which the third generation quarks couple differently than the lighter quarks .",
    "in addition to a set of heavy color - octet vector bosons ( colorons ) , the model also contains a set of heavy weak vector quarks .",
    "mixing between ordinary quark generations occurs only because all three generations mix with the vector quarks .",
    "since the heavy vector quarks transform in the same way under the extended color sector as the third generation quarks and differently from the lighter families , we naturally obtain small mixing between the third generation of quarks and the first two .",
    "the model has the gauge structure @xmath5 .",
