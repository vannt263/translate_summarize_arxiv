    "random numbers play a key role in many areas , such as statistical analysis , computer simulations and cryptography @xcite .",
    "traditionally , pseudo - random number generator ( pseudo - rng ) based on deterministic algorithms has long been used for various applications . recently",
    ", physical - rng based on chaotic behaviors of semiconductor lasers has been proposed to generate ultrahigh - speed random bits @xcite .",
    "generally speaking , the above schemes can not generate truly random numbers with information - theoretically provable randomness .",
    "the output signal from a chaotic - laser system @xcite presents a property of periodicity due to the photon round trip time and the chaotic - laser system is essentially a deterministic system , which in principle can not offer truly inherent randomness .",
    "we remark that very recently , fast physical - rng using amplified optical noise has also been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "quantum - rng ( qrng ) , on the other hand , can generate truly random numbers from the fundamentally probabilistic nature of quantum processes . in the past decade ,",
    "several qrng schemes , such as single - photon detection @xcite , quantum non - locality @xcite , and vacuum state fluctuations @xcite have been demonstrated .",
    "meanwhile , commercial qrngs such as i d quantique system @xcite have already appeared on the market .",
    "however , previous implementations have been limited to a relatively low rate due to the difficulties in measuring quantum effects : the speed of the single - photon - detection qrng @xcite is limited by the maximum counting rate of single - photon detectors , which is typically below 100 mhz @xcite ; quantum - non - locality qrng @xcite is a proof - of - concept demonstration ( with a random number generation rate on the order of 1 bit / s ) and thus unsuitable for practical applications ; building a fast shot - noise limited homodyne - detector for vacuum - state - fluctuations qrng @xcite is also a big challenge . in 2009 , our group proposed and built a fast qrng by measuring the quantum phase fluctuations ( or noise ) of a laser , which yields a speed of 500 mb / s @xcite . instead of directly measuring weak quantum effects , this scheme measures the enhanced quantum noise ( amplified spontaneous emissions ) and",
    "thus can be realized by _",
    "conventional photodetectors _ at a high - speed and with a low cost .",
    "a similar scheme at a lower speed has also been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the key point is , the generation rates of all previous qrngs are still too low for many applications , such as high - speed quantum key distribution @xcite operating over ghz .",
    "moreover in real experiments , the quantum randomness is inevitably mixed with the classical noise , which may be observed or even controlled by a potential adversary .",
    "if we consider a scenario where the adversary tries to guess the outcomes from a qrng , then she could take advantage of the side information due to classical noise .",
    "thus , a refined post - processing scheme is necessary to remove the correlation between the generated random bits and the classical noise .",
    "two post - processing methods that are widely - used in various qrng implementations are least - significant - bits ( lsb ) @xcite and non - universal hashing functions @xcite .",
    "it is important to perform such post - processing on the raw data to distill out a shorter , but more secure , string of random bits .",
    "however , neither lsb procedures nor non - universal hashing functions are _ information - theoretically provable _ , the property of which is especially valuable in current technology .",
    "hence , it is still arguable whether these two methods can indeed extract out perfect - random bits . on the other hand , in theoretical computer science",
    ", there has been much interest in post - processing methods , called randomness extractors @xcite .",
    "the randomness from many extractors has been information - theoretically proven , such as trevisan s extractor @xcite .",
    "however , none of these extractors have been implemented in a real qrng experiment .",
    "therefore , there is a gap between theory and experiment .    in this paper , we report an ultrafast qrng with a generation rate over 6 gb / s based on measuring the quantum phase fluctuations of a laser operating at a low intensity level . compared with our previous works @xcite , both the hardware design and post - processing algorithm have been substantially improved . on the hardware side , a compact planar lightwave circuit mach - zehnder interferometer ( plc - mzi ) with internal temperature control",
    "is introduced to replace the bulky mzi constructed with discrete fiber components in ref .",
    "the high stability of the plc - mzi allows us to stabilize its phase by simply controlling its temperature .",
    "we emphasize that the simple and robust design of our qrng suggests that it can be readily commercialized for practical applications .    on the post - processing side ,",
    "we bridge the gap between the theory and practice of randomness extraction by applying randomness extractors . here",
    ", we quantify the quantum randomness and classical noise ( present in the qrng ) separately by min - entropy .",
    "the min - entropy is defined as @xmath10 \\right)$ ] , which quantifies the amount of randomness of a distribution @xmath11 on @xmath12 . in our experiment ,",
    "the min - entropy is evaluated by modeling the physical setup .",
    "we optimize the experimental parameters by maximizing the quantum randomness and implement two randomness extractors , trevisan s extractor @xcite and universal hashing ( toeplitz - hashing ) @xcite .",
    "both methods take finite - size effects into consideration . with this new post - processing scheme ,",
    "we not only improve the random number generation rate @xcite by more than one order of magnitude , but also achieve an information - theoretically provable randomness .",
    "it is the first qrng experiment that implements such extractors .",
    "it is well known that the fundamental phase fluctuations ( or noise ) of a laser can be attributed to spontaneous emission , which is quantum mechanical by nature @xcite .",
    "the quantum phase fluctuations are inversely proportional to the laser output power @xcite . by operating the laser at a low intensity level",
    ", the quantum phase fluctuations can dominate over classical phase noise @xcite and be readily extracted to generate truly random numbers .",
    "we have developed a delayed self - heterodyning system to measure the phase fluctuations .",
    "the schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in fig .  [ fig.1 ] .",
    "a 1.55 _ @xmath13 m _ single mode cw distribute - feedback ( dfb ) diode laser ( ilx lightwave ) operating at a low intensity level is the source of quantum phase fluctuations .",
    "a plc - mzi with a 500ps delay difference ( manufactured by ntt ) is employed to convert the phase fluctuations to intensity fluctuations , which is subsequently detected by a 5ghz ingaas photodetector ( thorlabs ) .",
    "note that to achieve a high interference visibility , a polarization maintaining fiber is used to connect the laser and the plc - mzi . a temperature controller ( tc )",
    "@xcite is used to stabilize the phase difference of plc - mzi .",

    "we have assumed that the intensity noise of the laser is negligible @xcite , which has been verified experimentally ( see discussion below ) .",
    "it is convenient to further separate the total phase fluctuations ( measured by the system ) into a quantum part and a classical part .",
    "while the quantum phase fluctuations are inversely proportional to laser output power and can be treated as gaussian white noise @xcite , the classical phase noise is laser - power independent @xcite , which in principle could be controlled by a potential adversary .",
    "hence , the variance of the total phase fluctuations can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes a statistical average , @xmath3 and @xmath2 represent the contributions of quantum phase fluctuations and classical phase noise respectively .",
    "we remark that within the time scale of our experiment , @xmath31 , @xmath21 and @xmath2 do not vary with time .    in practice ,",
    "the detection system will also contribute a laser - power independent background noise @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the variance of the output a.c .",
    "voltage @xmath5 from the photodetector of our system is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is is a constant determined by the gain of the photodetector .    in eq .",

    "the experimental data points are determined with an oscilloscope at different laser power levels ( see details in ref .",
    "we can see that at low and high power range , either the background noise @xmath32 or the classical phase noise @xmath42 will dominate over the quantum signal .",
    "the optimal ratio @xmath43 is achieved at @xmath44 @xmath45 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , by operating the laser at this power , the extractable quantum randomness is also maximized .",
    "therefore , we choose @xmath46 @xmath45 as the working point of laser .",
    "we also perform measurements in the frequency domain by using an rf spectrum analyzer .",
    "three different power - spectra have been acquired : ( 1 ) the spectrum of total phase fluctuations under the optimal working condition ( @xmath46 @xmath45 ) ; ( 2 ) the intensity noise spectrum acquired by connecting the laser output directly to the photodetector ; ( 3 ) the background noise spectrum acquired by turning off the laser .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] .",
    "we can see that under the normal operating condition , the intensity noise is negligible compared to the phase fluctuations .",
    "this result supports our previous assumption .",
    "note that since the plc - mzi is a fiber - pigtailed compact device , we expect that the coupling efficiency between the laser and the plc - mzi will stay constant over time .",
    "as we expect from a perfect white noise source , the spectrum of phase fluctuations itself is flat over the whole measurement frequency range . in the spectrum of background noise",
    ", there are a few spectral lines that could be environmental em noise picked up by our detector @xcite .",

    "the sampling range of adc is determined by the peak - to - peak voltage of @xmath5 ( around 30 mv ) @xcite and the bins of adc are equally spaced .",
    "thus , from each sample point , we can generate 8 raw random bits that are ready for post - processing .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the raw random bits from our qrng are contributed by both the quantum signal and the classical noise . in order to remove the correlation between the random bits and the classical noise ( and",

    "the evaluation of min - entropy is discussed in this section , while randomness extraction will be described in the following section .",

    "a simple illustration of the evaluation process is shown in fig .",
    "[ minentropy : fig ] , where the raw - data follows a gaussian distribution and is digitized by a 3-bit adc .",

    "[ minentropy : fig ] ) with maximal probability is ` 011 ' ( or ` 100 ' ) and its corresponding probability @xmath50 can be calculated from its bin area .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ minentropy : fig ] , three key parameters to determine @xmath50 ( thus min - entropy ) are the standard deviation of gaussian distribution ( @xmath51 ) , the adc sampling range ( @xmath52 ) and the resolution of adc ( 3-bit in fig  [ minentropy : fig ] ) .    in our experiment ,",
    "a physical model is derived to evaluate the quantum min - entropy of the raw - data .",
    "our main assumptions are : ( 1 ) quantum signal is independent of classical noise when the laser is operating above threshold ; ( 2 ) quantum signal follows a gaussian distribution @xcite ; ( 3 ) the sequence of the raw - data is independent and identically distributed ( iid , see @xcite and discussion below ) .    with these assumptions",

    "we can obtain the variance of the total fluctuations , @xmath53 . at the laser emission power 0.95 @xmath45",
    ", we choose the adc sampling range as @xmath54 mv and obtain the variance of the total fluctuations as @xmath55 .",
    "2 .   evaluate signal to noise ratio : from fig .",

    "3 .   evaluate the quantum variance : from eq .",

    "the quantum variance is @xmath56 .",
    "4 .   calculate the lower bound of the quantum min - entropy : as shown in fig .",
    "[ minentropy : fig ] , given the adc range @xmath52 , we evaluate the bin with maximal probability from the gaussian distribution derived in step 3 , which gives the lower bound of the min - entropy of the quantum signal .",
    "note that in real experiment we use an 8-bit adc ( instead of 3-bit in fig .",
    "[ minentropy : fig ] ) and its bins are equally spaced . at 0.95 @xmath45 ,",
    "the standard deviation of the gaussian distribution is @xmath57 @xmath58 and the corresponding maximal probability of the raw sequence is @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ minentropy : definition ] ) , the quantum min - entropy of our raw - data is 6.7 bits per sample ( 8 raw bits from the adc in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] ) .",
    "one might ask ` whether the randomness generation rate is bounded by the channel capacity @xcite of a noisy channel through the signal - to - noise ratio ? ' in our opinion , the answer is _",
    "no_. the main function of a qrng is not to recover the quantum signal ( source of quantum randomness ) from the background of the classical noise , but to generate random bits which have no correlations with the classical noise .",
    "we can assume that our quantum signal ultimately gives us a classical number _ x _ ( random number generation ) and the adversary ( eve ) inputs a classical number _ e _ ( by controlling the classical noise ) .",
    "_ x _ and _ e _ are combined together to obtain the raw output _",
    "y_. hence , the whole discussion can be phrased within classical information theory .",
    "for instance , we can consider the discrete case and the simple function that _ y _ is the exclusive - or of _ x _ and _ e_. suppose _ x _ and _ e _ are both one random bit , then the output _",
    "y _ will also be random and the conditional entropy @xmath60 is 1 bit , where eve has no information about _",
    "y_. on the other hand , since eve can decide whether to flip the bit or not , the mutual information between _ x _ and _ y _ is @xmath61 .",
    "the channel capacity is zero . in summary",
    ", this simple example shows that it is possible for the randomness generation ( i.e. @xmath62 bit ) to be non - zero even though the channel capacity is zero .",
    "the channel capacity is not an upper bound to the randomness generation rate .",
    "in previous section , we have shown that the lower bound of quantum min - entropy is 6.7 bits per sample , which means that we can generate 6.7 information - theoretically random bits from each sample ( 8 raw bits ) .",
    "we remark that the raw - data itself can not pass the statistical random tests , which is mainly due to the classical noises mixed in the raw - data and the fact that the as - obtained quantum phase fluctuations follow a gaussian distribution instead of an uniform distribution .",
    "therefore , to extract the 6.7 perfect - random bits and improve the randomness quality of our raw - data , randomness extractor is implemented .",
    "roughly speaking , a randomness extractor is a function as @xmath63 which means that for a raw and non - perfect - random sequence @xmath11 on @xmath12 with min - entropy @xmath64 , the extracted output sequence @xmath65 is a nearly uniform distribution on @xmath66 . in other words",
    ", a randomness extractor takes a small random seed ( @xmath67 bits ) and a raw random source ( @xmath9 bits ) and outputs a near perfect - random bit - string ( @xmath18 bits ) .",
    "a more rigorous discussion of randomness extractor can be found in @xcite .",
    "we implement two randomness extractors , toeplitz - hashing extractor @xcite and trevisan s extractor @xcite .",
    "both are proven to be information - theoretically secure and take finite - size effects into account @xcite .",
    "the details of our implementation are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we give a brief summary .",
    "toeplitz - hashing extractor extracts random bit - string @xmath18 by multiplying the raw sequence @xmath9 with the toeplitz matrix ( @xmath9-by-@xmath18 matrix , random seed ) .",
    "the seed length of random bits required to construct the toeplitz matrix is @xmath68 @xcite . in our implementation with matlab on a standard laptop computer ,",
    "we choose the input bit - string length as @xmath69 .",
    "since the min - entropy of our raw - data is 6.7 bits per 8-bit sample , the output bit - string is @xmath70 . to generate near perfect - random bits ,",
    "the output length is set to @xmath71 bits ( see @xcite ) .",

    "note that toeplitz - hashing can be implemented much faster with hardware implementations @xcite . for trevisan s extractor",
    ", we implement its improved version @xcite and the details are shown in @xcite .",
    "the output from both extractors successfully passes all the standard statistic tests of diehard @xcite , nist @xcite , and testu01 @xcite .",

    "figure  [ fig : subfig1 ] shows the autocorrelation results of our raw - data .",
    "the low values of the autocorrelation between raw samples ( 8-bit per sample ) verify the iid assumption of our physical model for min - entropy evaluation ( see assumption 3 in section  [ minentropy ] ) .",
