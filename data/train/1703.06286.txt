    "quantum walks ( qws ) were introduced as a quantization of random walks ( rws ) @xcite .",

    "the amplitude of quantum walker is obtained by this unitary iteration to some initial state . due to the unitarity of the time iteration ,",
    "the norm of the amplitude is preserved , which implies that the distribution can be defined at each time step .",
    "however it is believed that there are no non - trivial representations of the present distribution of qws by that of past time like markov chain @xcite .",

    "grover s search algorithm was introduced to search marked elements in database .    in this paper",

    "moreover the multiplicity of @xmath142 is also @xmath136 because of @xmath143 .",
    "so we can obtain @xmath144 considering the connectivity of @xmath41 and the summation of their multiplicities , we can obtain that @xmath122 is the only graph which leads ( 1 ) as a spectrum of its transition matrix .",
    "indeed , @xmath145 obviously it induces a @xmath123-periodic grover walk .",
    "then such a graph is only @xmath122 .",
    "in this section we show that the graphs inducing an odd - periodic grover walk should satisfy some conditions .",

    "we assume that @xmath150 . for all of the eigenvalues of @xmath39",

    "if @xmath150 , then at least one @xmath142 is an eigenvalue of @xmath39 by theorem 1.2 . since @xmath0 is odd , @xmath142 does not satisfy the condition .",
    "thus it should hold that @xmath153 .",
    "it follows that @xmath154 from the connectivity of @xmath41 .",
    "then such graphs must be trees , which satisfy @xmath155 , or cycles , unicycles , which satisfy @xmath156 . from corollary 3.4 and theorem 1.2 , trees , even cycles , and even unicycles are improper graphs since they are bipartite .",
    "hence , an odd cycle and an odd unicycles can induce a @xmath0-periodic grover walk for an odd @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath146      first , we introduce an easy lemma and obtain a restriction of unicycle graphs which induce an odd - periodic grover walk .",
    "we prove theorem 3.2 with them .",
    "the graphs @xmath157 induce a @xmath0-periodic grover walk .",

    ", it should hold that @xmath175 .",
    "we consider two cases ( i ) @xmath176 , ( ii ) @xmath177 and show @xmath178 in the both of cases .",

    ", we consider the walks with length @xmath0 from @xmath81 to @xmath81 .",
    "since the distance between @xmath81 and @xmath81 is even and @xmath41 is a unicycle , we have to traverse @xmath166 to go from @xmath81 to @xmath81 with odd steps .",
    "this walk has the length at least @xmath180 .",
    "so there are no walks from @xmath81 to @xmath81 with length @xmath0 since @xmath176 .",
    "therefore we can conclude that @xmath181 , and it gives us a contradiction .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath182 . by the observation of ( i ) , the walks should run through @xmath166 at once .",
    "since @xmath182 , there are only two walks such as @xmath183 hence , @xmath184 it follows @xmath185 and @xmath186 from @xmath175 .",
    "therefore @xmath187 however it holds that @xmath188 due to the choice of the subgraph .",
    "thus it follows that @xmath189 .",
    "@xmath146    proof of theorem 3.2 : from the previous arguments , the graphs inducing @xmath128 , @xmath27-periodic grover walks are @xmath126 , @xmath127 or the other unicycle graphs , respectively .",
    "proposition 3.6 leads the fact that the girth @xmath70 of such unicycle graphs should be @xmath190 for @xmath191 , and @xmath27 .",

    "similar to proof of theorem 2.1 , for any @xmath108 , it should hold that @xmath194 , and it follows that @xmath195 thus , @xmath196 .",
    "therefore we can obtain @xmath193 immediately , their multiplicities are determined by lemma 2.2 and lemma 2.3 .",
    "next we show its sufficiency .",
