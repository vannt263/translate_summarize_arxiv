    "one of the most important results derived from deep galaxy surveys is that star formation in the more massive galaxies ( galaxies with stellar masses larger than approximately @xmath1  m@xmath2 ) is regulated by gradual processes such as gas exhaustion ( @xcite ) .",
    "this fact implies that the star formation history ( sfh ) of these galaxies can be described by slowly varying functions of time ( on timescales larger than approximately 100  myr ) . however , stochastic processes are expected to dominate in dwarf galaxies ( galaxies with stellar masses lower than approximately @xmath1  m@xmath2 ) .",
    "specifically , the star formation in dwarf galaxies occurs in only a small number of regions and in a small volume . in such systems ,",
    "feedback from supernovae can heat and expel gas from a volume comparable to the entire volume of the cold gas region , resulting in a temporary quenching of star formation .",
    "therefore , the sfhs of dwarf galaxies are characterized by frequent bursts of star formation and subsequent quenching ( on timescales of the order of a few myr ; @xcite ) .",
    "this burstiness may be caused mainly by supernovae feedback ( @xcite ) .",
    "bursty sfhs complicate our interpretation of observable properties , and oversimplification of these sfhs may lead to significant biases in determinations of fundamental galaxy properties ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent studies are showing that low mass galaxies at high redshift are contributing significantly to the total star formation rate density ( @xcite ) . understanding these low mass galaxies , especially at @xmath33 when the star formation rate ( sfr ) of the universe peaked ( @xcite ) ,",
    "is essential for explaining a number of phenomena in the early universe .",
    "first , it is thought that dwarf galaxies reionized the intergalactic medium at @xmath4 and provided a significant fraction of the ionizing background at @xmath5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "many investigations of escaping lyman continuum from galaxies are necessarily conducted at redshifts of @xmath6 ( @xcite ) , as the igm becomes more opaque at higher redshift ( @xcite ) . in these studies",
    ", one typically assumes an intrinsic lyman continuum flux based on the non - ionizing uv flux at approximately 1500    ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , this conversion usually assumes constant star formation for a long duration ( longer than 100  myr ) .",
    "the bursty sfhs of dwarf galaxies will significantly affect the level of lyman continuum flux , the selection of the galaxies , and our interpretation of the global _ escape fraction _ of lyman continuum photons .",
    "furthermore , the bursty star formation also has important implications for interpreting the byproducts of the lyman continuum ( nebular emission lines ) in dwarf galaxies .",
    "second , among more massive galaxies , there is a tight correlation between star formation and stellar mass .",
    "this correlation , called the star - forming main sequence , may exist from the local universe up to @xmath7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these observations lead to the interpretation , mentioned above , that star formation in these galaxies is predominantly regulated by gradual processes .",
    "whether this tight relation remains at lower masses is still unclear , although very recently progress has been made by @xcite in measuring the _ average _ main sequence in lower mass galaxies .",
    "bursty star formation should increase the dispersion in this relation .",
    "unfortunately , the star formation indicators that we typically use , namely ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) fluxes , vary on much larger time scales than the star formation in dwarf galaxies .",
    "it is therefore possible that we are not able to detect an increased scatter in the sfr at low mass with these traditional indicators .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze how bursty sfhs produced by hydro - dynamical simulations affect our current knowledge of the two issues stated above : the ionizing photon production and its subsequent effect on observables ( nebular line strengths , searches for escaping lyman continuum ) , and the appearance of a tight star - forming main sequence .",
    "the methodology is based on using a stellar population synthesis code to model the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of these bursty galaxies , which cover the stellar mass range from @xmath8  m@xmath2 to @xmath9  m@xmath2 at @xmath3 .",
    "physical galaxy properties such as stellar masses and star - formation rates are also derived by using sed fitting , which are compared with their known values from the model galaxies ( @xcite ) .",

    "finally , we summarize in  [ sec : summary ] the main conclusions of our analysis . throughout the paper",
    ", we use the same cosmology assumed by the simulations , this is , a @xmath10cdm cosmology with @xmath11  km  s@xmath12  mpc@xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ( according to data from the third release of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe , wmap  3 , @xcite ) .",
    "the bursty in - situ sfhs used in our analysis , defined as the star formation that occurs within the most massive progenitor of the main halo , are extracted from the hydro - dynamical simulations that are described in this section .",
    "the high - resolution simulations used in this work were run using the _ volume re - normalization technique _ ( or _ zoom - in technique _ ) with the n - body plus smoothed - particle hydrodynamics code ` gasoline ` ( @xcite ) .",
    "the galaxies were selected to span a range of merger histories .",
    "all 11 of the galaxies in this work have been published and discussed more extensively in previous papers .",
    "importantly for this work , earlier papers using these simulated galaxies have shown that they have realistic rotation curves ( @xcite ) , that they match the @xmath15 stellar mass to halo mass relation derived from abundance matching techniques ( @xcite ) , and that the bursty star formation history in the seven lowest mass galaxies leads to the creation of dark matter cores in their central density profiles ( @xcite ) .",
    "these simulations also match the observed mass  metallicity relation ( @xcite ) , the sizes of galaxy disks ( @xcite ) , and result in a realistic population of satellites in milky way - mass galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "these simulated galaxies are among the highest resolution achieved in cosmological simulations to date .",
    "the high resolution allows us to resolve the high density gas clouds where stars form . with this scheme ,",
    "we have successfully matched a large range of observed galaxy properties , as mentioned above .",
    "an extensive discussion of the star formation and feedback scheme in these simulations is found in @xcite .",
    "below , we summarize the salient information about the simulations .",
    "the spline force softening in these simulations ranges from 65  pc ( h2003 ) to 87  pc ( h516 and h799 ) to 174  pc ( all others ) .",
    "high resolution dark matter particles have masses of 6661  m@xmath2 ( 1.3@xmath1610@xmath17  m@xmath2 ) , while gas particles start with 1407  m@xmath2 ( 2.7@xmath1610@xmath18  m@xmath2 ) for the lowest ( largest ) mass galaxies .",
    "star particles are born with 30% of the mass of their parent gas particle and lose mass through supernova ( both ia and ii ) and stellar winds .",
    "each of these galaxies has between one to five million dark matter particles within the virial radius at @xmath15 .",
    "the simulations not only include metal line cooling and metal diffusion ( @xcite ) , but a prescription for the formation ( both gas - phase and on dust grains ) and destruction ( primarily photo - dissociation by lyman - werner radiation from nearby stellar populations ) of h@xmath19 ( @xcite ) .",
    "star formation is tied directly to the presence of h@xmath19 , as observed ( @xcite ) .",
    "these simulations also include a uniform uv background that turns on at @xmath20 , mimicking cosmic reionization following a modified version of @xcite .",
    ".the first column lists the simulation name .",
    "the second and third columns show the stellar masses at @xmath21 and @xmath15 ( respectively ; see text for details ) from the in - situ sfhs output by the ` galaxev ` code .",
    "the galaxies are sorted increasingly from top to bottom by their stellar mass at @xmath21 .",
    "the h986.grp2 and h986.grp3 merge with the most massive progenitor h986.grp1 by @xmath15 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the sfrs of dwarf galaxies are expected to change on time - scales similar to lifetimes of the ionizing o - stars .",
    "therefore , we might expect wide variations in the ionizing photon production rate in these systems .",
    "the ratio between the continuum luminosities @xmath22 is typically used to derive the relative escape fraction of ionizing photons and also to convert from observed uv luminosity functions to lyc photon production rates ( @xcite ) .",
    "this flux ratio is usually assumed as a constant ratio of approximately 7 ( or 0.84 in @xmath23 ) .",
    "this value is reached when the equilibrium state is produced under continuous star formation when the number of stars producing lyc and 1500    flux is constant ( or about 200  myr after the burst ) .",
    "the @xmath24 $ ] is shown in figure  [ fig : uvratio ] as a function of time for three different galaxies .",
    "we see that the scatter of @xmath24 $ ] is significantly larger in the low mass galaxies , varying by nearly an order of magnitude on short time scales but only around 0.1  dex for the larger mass galaxies .    in figure",
    "[ fig : histuv ] , we show the normalized distribution of @xmath24 $ ] for three different stellar mass bins that include all evolutionary stages . from the analysis of our simulations ,",
    "it is clear that the assumption of @xmath24\\sim 0.84 $ ] is valid for the larger mass galaxies but not for the lower mass galaxies due to significantly large scatter .",
    "the scatter is quantified as the standard deviation of the distribution in three stellar mass bins in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "this scatter in @xmath22 in low mass galaxies will require particular care in interpreting studies of escaping lyc .",
    "first , there are some galaxies , caught just when a burst begins , that have large lyc luminosities relative to the non - ionizing 1500    luminosities .",
    "this will make them easier to detect in direct lyc searches .",
    "these same galaxies will have very high intrinsic ( unextinguished by dust ) ew ( see figure [ fig : lyavsuv ] ) .",
    "therefore , galaxies selected for high ew ( @xcite ) will have a higher likelihood of lyc detection than galaxies with lower ew , even if the lyc escape fractions are similar .",
    "second , low mass galaxies that have recently turned off their star formation will still be reasonably luminous at 1500   , but will not be producing significant lyc photons . in figure",
    "[ fig : histuv ] , we can see that 38% of low mass ( m@xmath25  m@xmath2 ) galaxies have @xmath24>1.3 $ ] ( or above 20 in linear terms ) .",
    "these galaxies would often result in non - detections in direct lyc surveys , even if the lyc escape fractions of these galaxies were high .",
    "ultimately , the _ burstiness _ of star formation as a function of mass will need to be better determined and incorporated into any analysis of lyc observations .",
    "we note that in larger mass galaxies ( m@xmath26 ) , it is reasonable to assume a constant @xmath22 because the star formation does not typically change much on short time scales .     for three galaxies of significantly different stellar mass at different evolutionary stages .",
    "these galaxies are our lowest mass galaxy h2003.grp1 ( @xmath27 ) , the intermediate mass galaxy h986.grp1 ( @xmath28 ) , and our largest mass galaxy h277.grp1 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the evolutionary stages above the horizontal line are considered typical emitters . in general ,",
    "non - emitter are significantly faint in the lyc .",
    "though many lyc searches of high redshift galaxies are not targeting low mass galaxies with low ew , those galaxies likely do not have strong lyman continuum luminosities anyway , as the star formation may have recently been quenched .",
    "for instance , our galaxy of lowest mass is a emitter for 57% of the time . ]",
    "@xcite find a high ionizing emissivity from emitters at @xmath30 , possibly explaining the entire ionizing background at that redshift .",
    "this finding is initially surprising because only a subset of uv - bright galaxies ( ly@xmath31 emitters ) is enough to explain , at least , a significant fraction of the ionizing background .",
    "however , it may be possible that ly@xmath31-emitting galaxies are the only ones producing significantly strong lyc .",
    "indeed , this is shown in figure  [ fig : lyavsuv ] , where we plot ew as a function of @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "the horizontal line shown in figure  [ fig : lyavsuv ] defines typical emitters as intrinsic ew larger than 60    if we assume a escape fraction of 50% .",
    "( typically emitters are selected at ew larger than 30    and have escape fractions of 3060% , @xcite . )",
    "as we see in the figure , in general , galaxies that are not emitters are by definition faint in the lyc .",
    "we stress here that all of these ew predictions are _ intrinsic _ measures before scattering by hi and absorption by dust",
    ". of course , most of the more massive , dusty galaxies , will not be emitters .",
    "therefore , galaxies selected as emitters may be primarily composed of lower mass galaxies ( with lower columns of neutral hydrogen and dust ) in a burst phase . determining exactly when each galaxy will be a ly@xmath31-emitter requires more detailed dust modeling and ray tracing , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "nonetheless , we stress that low mass galaxies may not produce significant lyc about half of the time and selection on high ew will miss these galaxies .",
    "thus , it may not be surprising that a large fraction of the known ionizing background at high redshift is caused by low mass galaxies selected as ly@xmath31-emitters .",

    "$ ] versus stellar mass for our galaxies .",
    "the dashed line shows that ratio at 2.05 for a constant sfh after a steady state is reached .",
    "the bursty sfhs of the numerical simulations predict that a population exists with @xmath0>2.5 $ ] at @xmath32 , a clear indicator of rapid quenching of star formation . ]",
    "a potential problem in our calculations is the fact that photons significantly scatter with neutral hydrogen within the galaxy before escaping .",
    "this effect may produce a delay in the escape of the photons from the galaxy , which could smooth the luminosity time variation .",
    "however , given the size of a typical dwarf galaxy at @xmath3 ( of the order of a kpc ) any delay due to a large number of scatters should be significantly smaller than the 1  myr resolution of our simulations .",
    "recently , very young galaxies have been found at @xmath33 by identifying galaxies with large ew nebular emission lines ( @xcite ) . in particular , the ew is a proxy of the specific star - formation rate of a galaxy ( the star - formation per unit of stellar mass ) .",
    "the rest - frame intrinsic and ews are plotted in figure  [ fig : ews ] as a function of stellar mass .",
    "both ews have a similar behaviour . their scatter increases in the low mass galaxies as a consequence of the burstiness of the sfhs .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] quantifies the dispersion of the and ews distribution as the standard deviation in three stellar mass bins .",
    "we note that the dispersion of the ew is larger than the dispersion of ew at all masses .",
    "the reason is that when the lyc is high ( during a burst of star formation ) , both and emission - line luminosities increase by the same factor .",
    "however , the rest - uv continuum at 1216    also increase strongly at the same time , whereas the continuum near 6563    does not change as much as the rest - uv continuum .",
    "therefore , the ew change is more dramatic .",
    "the equivalent widths increase immediately following a new burst of star formation , as the ionizing photon production rate reacts immediately , but the continuum flux takes a longer time to increase .",
    "conversely , a few myr after the star formation turns off , the lyc disappears but the 1500    flux fades much more slowly .",
    "thus , the ews quickly go to zero in recently quenched systems .",
    "we note that the plotted ews are maximum values because it is expected that a significant fraction of photons will be absorbed by dust as it scatters through the interstellar and circumgalactic media .",
    "two of the most common star formation rate indicators at high redshift are the uv and luminosities . however , as seen above , the ionizing continuum responsible for producing can change on very short time scales but the uv continuum takes longer to react .",
    "therefore , we expect that the uv and h@xmath31-derived sfrs may differ significantly depending on when the galaxy is observed ( @xcite )",
    ". figure  [ fig : luvha ] shows the @xmath0 $ ] as a function of stellar mass .",
    "the @xmath0 $ ] tends to a value of 2.05 for the larger mass galaxies .",
    "this value corresponds to luminosities from a galaxy with constant sfr when the equilibrium in the number of o - stars to uv - emitting stars is reached .",
    "we can see in figure  [ fig : luvha ] that dwarf galaxies with bursty sfhs are characterized by @xmath0>2.5 $ ] shortly after star formation has been quenched . both @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    "are typically observed by deep galaxy surveys .",
    "therefore , this figure provides a reliable test for bursty sfhs in star - forming galaxies based on large ratios of the uv continuum at 1500    and the emission luminosity .",
    "the effect of periodic bursty sfhs on the ratio of uv and luminosity is studied in low redshift dwarf galaxies by some authors such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors use analytical models to explore the amplitude , duty cycle , and duration of bursts of star formation by fitting the observed distribution of uv to ratios . in our analysis",
    ", we take an alternative approach using sfhs motivated by results from hydro - dynamical cosmological simulations .      at low sfrs",
    ", additional analysis uncertainties may arise due to poor sampling of the high mass end of the imf .",
    "individual bursts may also have different imfs .",
    "stochastic effects on the imf have been studied by other authors such as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite using the code stochastically lighting up galaxies by @xcite . according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure 1 and figure 2 ) this effect becomes important at star formation rates lower than 0.01  m@xmath2yr@xmath12 . from the examples shown in our figure  [ fig : sfhs ] , we note that the stellar mass involved in the bursts considered is sufficiently high that individual bursts fairly sample the underlying imf .",
    "this implies that this stochasticity effect should not be too large in our sample .",
    "though we expect this to be a minor effect , it will result in a slight decrease in the distribution of and ews at the low mass end in figure  [ fig : ews ] .",
    "however , all the main observational conclusions of this paper will not be affected .",
    "typically , when evaluating trends in sfhs , the sfr is plotted as a function of stellar mass to show the star - forming main sequence .",
    "our theoretical work complements other observational analyses of the main sequence . here , we choose to analyze directly the luminosities instead of the sfrs to avoid any uncertainties from their conversion .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ms ] , we plot the sfr versus stellar mass .",
    "in addition , three other observables are plotted in figure  [ fig : ms ] , h@xmath31 luminosity , uv luminosity density , and optical luminosity density versus stellar mass .",
    "one can see that the large variation in sfr in low mass galaxies is traced very well by as it reacts quickly to the changing sfr .",
    "the uv variations are not as large as the sfr variations , and the optical luminosity is essentially unaffected by the sfr variations .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] lists the standard deviation of these observables in three mass bins . at large mass ,",
    "the dispersion in sfr is small , and both and uv reasonably trace the sfr variations ( though is certainly better ) .",
    "however , at lower masses ( m@xmath36  m@xmath2 ) , as the sfr variations increase , the uv dramatically under - predicts the sfr variation .",
    "therefore , our results show that , for low mass galaxies , a tight correlation of @xmath37 with stellar mass does not necessarily mean a smooth star formation history .",
    "rather , it just means that a significant amount of the variance in star formation is on time scales shorter than it takes for the uv - emitting stars to react .",
    "as we study fainter galaxies , we must seek to use star formation indicators that trace shorter times scales such as and other nebular emission lines .",
    "we also emphasize that observationally a flux limited survey will be strongly biased towards galaxies in the burst phase .",
    "this is especially true when the selection is made on emission lines because the luminosities change dramatically .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig : ms ] shows that the selection of recent hst  wfc3/ir grism surveys ( wisp , @xcite ; 3dhst , @xcite ) can detect galaxies at @xmath38 in a recent burst at stellar masses larger than @xmath39  m@xmath2 , but will miss the vast majority of the galaxies at around @xmath39  m@xmath2 .",
    "when the selection is made in the uv continuum the bias will be less severe since the uv scatter is lower but still significant .",
    "figure 7 shows that the hudf depths ( @xcite ) can detect galaxies currently in a burst at @xmath40  m@xmath2 but the depths need to be an order of magnitude lower to detect all galaxies of that mass .",
    "indeed , uv selection of dwarf galaxies at these redshifts ( @xcite ) is still finding mostly galaxies which appear to be in a strong and recent burst of star formation ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we note that in figure  [ fig : ms ] , we calculate the average of the sfr and each observable for each galaxy by adding all of the individual values at each time step and dividing by the number of time steps ( that is , to get a mean , rather than a geometric mean ) .",
    "the values are plotted with the large star symbols , and are analogous to what observers would obtain when stacking large samples of galaxies in bins of stellar mass .",
    "the slope of the _ average _ sfr versus m@xmath41 relation is near one , consistent with the slope measured by @xcite in galaxies with @xmath42 at these high redshifts .",
    "however , other authors such as @xcite find a shallower slope of @xmath43 in galaxies with @xmath44 .",
    "we believe this is a natural consequence of a bias toward galaxies in a burst phase when selecting via emission lines . as a result ,",
    "the lowest mass galaxies detected in that survey are those with the largest sfrs .",
    "such a bias will naturally lead to perceiving a shallower main sequence .",
    "in this section , we explore how well sed fitting to broadband photometry can determine the physical properties of bursty galaxies .",
    "in particular , we examine the effects of the incorrect parameterization of the sfh on determining the galaxies sfrs and stellar masses .",
    "the code fitting and assessment of synthetic templates ( ` fast ` , see the appendix in @xcite for details ) is used to find the best fitting sed template from a grid of bc03 models .",
    "this fitting procedure is applied to the model galaxies simulating the following photometry : the uv / optical channel ( uvis ) of the wide - field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , the advance camera survey ( acs)/wfc ( f475w , f625w , f775w and f850lp ) and the near - infrared ( ir ) with wfc3/ir ( f125w and f160w ) .",
    "this is the same photometry used by @xcite and it spans the rest - uv to rest - optical across the balmer/4000  break .",
    "nebular emission lines are not included in the photometry , nor are they considered in the sed templates .",
    "therefore , we are isolating the effects of the bursty sfhs independent of complications due to emission line contributions to broadband photometry .",
    "a signal - to - noise of 20 is assumed for each photometric band , thus noise is not a significant issue .",
    "the imf is assumed to be given by @xcite .",
    "the parameter space explored by ` fast ` is given by @xmath45 up to a maximum age given by the age of the universe , @xmath46 ( since our model galaxies do not have any dust extinction ) , the metallicity is fixed to @xmath47 and the sfh @xmath48 with @xmath4910  gyr .",
    "note that we assume that , on average , the sfrs are exponentially rising .",
    "this has been suggested to be more accurate than exponentially decreasing sfhs by other authors such as @xcite in describing star - forming galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "then , physical properties are derived from these fits such as galaxy stellar mass and sfr .    , this galaxy has a stellar mass of @xmath28 .",
    "though the sed fitting reflects the average sfr , it can not recover the short timescale variations . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : h986 ] plots the galaxy sfr versus time for one of our simulated galaxies ( h986.grp1 , which has a stellar mass at @xmath21 of @xmath28 ) .",
    "the figure is showing the simulated sfr with a 1  myr resolution , the sfr from the simulations but averaged over 5  myr , and the sfr that is estimated from the sed fitting .",
    "it is clearly illustrated that the sfr provided by the sed fitting does not react rapidly enough to the bursty variations of the actual sfr as a consequence of being based on the uv continuum .",

    "a comparison of the sfrs from the sed fitting and the simulated sfrs is shown in figure  [ fig : sfr ] .",
    "the average values are calculated by the linear ( not geometric ) mean .",
    "this ensemble average is similar to what a deep - field survey would measure , as it randomly samples many galaxies at different stages of bursting and quenching to derive a star formation rate density .",
    "interestingly , the average sed - derived sfrs agree well with the actual average seds on long time scales . that is , there is no bias in one direction .",
    "these conclusions apply only if we observe the entire population of galaxies at a given mass .",
    "if a flux - limited survey only selects the brighter galaxies at a given mass , then it will only select the galaxies in a new burst and the derived average sfr would be biased high . as expected",
    ", the actual sfr scatter matches the scatter derived by the sed fitting for the larger mass galaxies .",
    "however , as expected from the previous result shown in figure  [ fig : h986 ] , the scatter in the sed - derived sfr is much lower than the actual sfr in the lower mass galaxies .    in figure  [",

    "the reason is that recent bursts ( with their high mass - to - light ratios ) can completely dominate the high mass - to - light ratio light from older generations of stars .",
    "qualitatively our results on the stellar masses are compatible with other analyses such as the one presented by @xcite .",

    "the star formation histories of dwarf galaxies are thought to be characterized by short bursts followed by rapid quenching due to supernovae feedback .",

    "the main points presented in our analysis are briefly summarized in this section .    * because the lyman continuum , @xmath56 , is emitted from only the most massive short - lived stars , it accurately traces the rapid and large variations in sfr in the low mass galaxies . specifically , the lyc ( and nebular emission lines related to the lyc ) vary by 1.03 , 0.45 , and 0.22  dex in the mass ranges of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "though the scatter in the non - ionizing uv continuum , @xmath34 , increases toward lower stellar mass , it does so at a much lower degree ( 0.43 , 0.28 , 0.16  dex in the same mass ranges ) . finally , the continuum at optical wavelengths , @xmath60 , and longward increases by only approximately 0.05  dex from the most massive to least massive bins . * because the ionizing photons vary on different time scales than the longer wavelength continuum photons , the ratio of non - ionizing to ionizing continuum can vary significantly in low mass galaxies , as the sfr variation also increases .",
    "this ratio , @xmath22 is an important number for converting direct lyc detections to lyc escape fractions or for converting observed uv luminosity functions to ionizing photon production rates . a constant value is often assumed .",
    "however , we show that this ratio can be lower by a factor of 2 in galaxies with recent bursts and can be very large after recent star - formation quenching .",
    "careful consideration of this variation will need to be taken into account in future studies of low mass galaxies . * because of the widely varying luminosities of dwarf galaxies , it is very difficult to obtain complete samples at a given mass in flux - limited surveys .",
    "selection of dwarf galaxies near the flux limit of a survey will be biased toward galaxies in the burst phase .",
    "this is of particular concern for h@xmath31-selected samples of lower mass galaxies like those selected with wfc3/ir grism spectroscopy .",
    "yet , it is also a concern for uv - selected dwarf galaxies as well .",
    "such selection biases should be carefully considered when attempting to determine average properties of dwarf galaxies at high redshift in future studies . *",
    "the ratio between uv and luminosity is a useful observable that quantifies burstiness in the sfh of dwarf galaxies .",
    "as new instruments allow detection in galaxies of lower mass at @xmath3 , this will be a particularly useful metric with which to quantify bursty star formation .",
    "specifically , @xmath0>2.5 $ ] signifies a recent shutdown of star formation on the timescale of less than 10  myr . determining this ratio in a large sample of dwarf galaxies will allow us to better constrain our models and simulations of supernovae feedback and bursty star formation . *",
    "dwarf galaxies are only significantly producing ionizing photons in their burst phase . and because galaxies in this phase are preferentially selected ( via uv continuum or nebular emission lines ) , it is much easier to find the galaxies responsible for the bulk of the ionizing emission than it is to detect a mass complete sample .",
    "such selection biases and their effects on derived escape fractions or volume ionizing emissivities of dwarf galaxies should be carefully considered .",
    "* while the scatter in @xmath34 does increase towards lower stellar masses , the scatter in @xmath35 is three times larger and closely reflects the actual variation in the sfr .",
    "therefore , when characterizing the dispersion in sfr of galaxies with @xmath61 , it is important to use a short timescale tracer of star formation such as h@xmath31 , and not the uv - to - optical continuum seds .",
    "* we investigate whether an incorrect ( slowly varying ) parametrization of the sfh results in incorrect derived quantities ( sfrs and stellar masses ) .",
    "we find that , on average , the sfrs derived from sed fitting are correct at all stellar masses .",
    "however , the sfr dispersion derived from seds is considerably smaller than the true sfr dispersion in these galaxies .",
    "these conclusions apply only if we sample the entire population of galaxies at a given mass , otherwise the sfr will be overestimated as flux - limited surveys will be biased toward selecting galaxies in a burst phase . * on average , for galaxies with @xmath52 ,",
    "the stellar masses from sed fitting are correct . however , for galaxies with @xmath62 , we find that stellar masses are underpredicted by the sed fitting by a factor 0.2  dex when assuming slowly varying sfhs .",
