    "in the aharonov - bohm effect ( ab),@xcite idealized in fig .",
    "1 , the motion of an electron in a mach - zehnder interferometer is influenced by electromagnetic fields even though the electron experiences no local , contemporaneous maxwell field .",
    "that comes about because the hamiltonian    @xmath0    contains the gauge fields v and @xmath1 , which have nonvanishing values at some points in the domain of the electron s position @xmath2 . for ab effect",
    ", we can ignore the electron s spin .",
    "then the operator equations of motion for the only observables are    @xmath3    those of a free particle , containing no electromagnetic fields .",
    "however , in quantum mechanics the equations of motion alone do not determine the dynamics .",
    "in the magnetic ab effect ( fig .",
    "1a ) , the partial waves in the two arms of the interferometer acquire a relative phase shift @xmath4 given by    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the flux through the solenoid .    in the electric ab effect ( fig .",
    "1b ) , the two arms of the interferometer carry the electron through conducting cylinders that shield the electron from an electric field .",
    "while the split wave packet is deep within one cylinder or the other , potentials @xmath7 and @xmath8 are applied to the two cylinders .",
    "that causes a relative phase shift given by    @xmath9    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the length of the time interval during which @xmath12 is different from zero .    in both cases ,",
    "the relative phase shift is measured by the outbound intensities    @xmath13    the ab effect is nonlocal in that the electron experiences no force and exchanges no momentum , energy , or angular momentum with the electromagnetic field ; and in that the hamiltonian , the equations of motion , and the commutation relations involve no local contemporaneous maxwell field at the electron s position .",
    "ab is a topological effect in that it requires the electron to be confined to a multiply- connected region and in that there is no objective way to relate a phase shift to any particular place or to either arm of the interferometer .",
    "the phase shift between any two feynman amplitudes depends only upon the difference between the topological winding numbers @xmath14 of their paths .",
    "@xmath15    the relative phase shift depends upon an integral whose integrand is not gauge invariant and not observable .",
    "the only gauge - invariant observable is the integral of this integrand over a closed path , and its value is proportional to the magnetic flux enclosed by this path .",
    "this effect is manifestly nonlocal , since its value depends upon a physical quantity in a region outside the domain of integration .",
    "it is topological in the sense that it depends only upon the topology of the path with reference to the enclosed magnetic flux . in an interferometer ,",
    "the winding numbers of the two arms differ by unity .",
    "the general role of the winding numbers is more obvious in the magnetic scattering geometry , illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . the differences in phase shift between different paths are gauge invariant , but no measurable phase shift can be assigned to any one path because @xmath16 along any one path depends upon the choice of gauge .",
    "the same is true of the electric ab effect .",
    "the potential difference @xmath17 is gauge invariant , but the potential v on one of the cylinders can be given any value by choice of gauge . therefore there is no objective way to associate the phase shift with one arm of the interferometer or the other .",
    "in a recent series of experiments , allman @xmath18@xcite passed unpolarized neutrons through a mach - zehnder interferometer one arm of which traversed a magnetic field @xmath19 , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "3 . the intensities of the two outbound beams were observed to obey eq .",
    "( 1.5 ) , where now the relative phase shift is given by    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the neutron s magnetic moment , b is the magnetic field strength , and @xmath22 is the time spent in the magnetic field .",
    "the experimenters interpreted their results as demonstrating a new topological effect which they named scalar aharonov - bohm effect ( sab ) .",
    "that claim was refuted by one of us,@xcite who pointed to ambiguities introduced by the use of unpolarized neutrons .",
    "( the same point had been made earlier by zeilinger,@xcite and the meaning of this kind of experiment was also discussed by anandan.@xcite )    here we will analyze the ideal sab experiment , also illustrated by fig .",
    "3 , in which : the neutron is to be polarized with @xmath23 , where the @xmath24 direction is that of the magnetic field , assumed to be spatially uniform ; b(t ) vanishes except during a time interval of length @xmath22 when it has the value b ; and the neutron is assumed to be in the magnetic field region throughout the time interval t so that it never experiences a field gradient .",
    "the relation of the @xmath24 direction to the plane of fig .",
    "3 is immaterial .",
    "the purposes of this analysis are to show that using polarized neutrons will not help and to explain how sab differs in principle from ab .",
    "in sab , the hamiltonian    @xmath25    contains the maxwell field , in contrast to ab , where the hamiltonian ( 1.1 ) contains only the gauge fields . the operator equations of motion    @xmath26    contain the local contemporaneous maxwell field , in contrast to ab , where no electromagnetic field enters the equation of motion of any measurable quantity .",
    "however , it is argued that sab resembles the electric ab affect ( eab ) in that role of in the sab hamiltonian ( 2.2 ) is very much that of a potential acting on the magnetic moment and in that no force acts on the neutron .",
    "also , the consequences of eq .",
    "( 2.3 ) are possibly uncertain because @xmath27 in a state with @xmath23 . in terms of the schroedinger equation , one may replace @xmath28 by the number + 1 in the hamiltonian ( 2.2 ) so that it becomes    @xmath29    and restrict the hilbert space to what appears as a one - component wave function with no dynamical variables other that and .",
    "then the mathematical analogy with eab is complete and one has the illusion @xcite that sab is a nonlocal , topological effect in the same sense as is eab .",
    "that reasoning gets the correct phase shift but it leads to an incorrect interpretation of the experiment . in sab ,",
    "the relative phase shift depends upon an integral whose integrand is locally gauge invariant and observable at every point in the path of the neutron .",
    "the integrand is proportional to the magnetic field directly in the path of the neutron and does not depend upon a physical quantity in a region outside that path .",
    "sab does not have the same topological character as ab , because the sab phase shift depends upon the local field along the path and not upon any winding number expressing the topology of a path around a region in which the particle does not move .",
    "the operator equations of motion do involve the local , contemporaneous maxwell field .",
    "moreover , in quantum mechanics , the spin is a dynamical variable and it can not simply be replaced by a number . the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 2.3 ) is a torque on the neutron whose expectation value vanishes at all times but whose fluctuations do not vanish .",
    "@xmath30    then an equal and opposite angular momentum must be transmitted to the local electromagnetic field , again with zero expectation but with fluctuations correlated with those of the neutron s angular momentum so that the total angular momentum is conserved .",
    "those field angular momentum fluctuations are not observable by a measurement on the field in the limit of a classical field , but they are observable in principle in a finite field .    the effect of the torque on the neutron is exposed by considering the spin autocorrelation operators    @xmath31 \\nonumber \\\\ s(t ) & = & \\case{1}{4 } [ { \\sigma_x}\\,(0 ) { \\sigma_y}\\,(t ) - { \\sigma_y}\\,(0 )   { \\sigma_x}\\,(t ) + h.c.]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these are hermitean operators , measurable in principle , and they commute with so there is no question about their significance in a state of definite @xmath28 .",
    "their equations of motion ,    @xmath32    contain the local contemporaneous maxwell field and the solutions are given by    @xmath33    where    @xmath34    these spin correlation operators can not be described classically for spin 1/2 , but they can be described simply in the context of the usual semiclassical vector model . there , the vectors @xmath35 and @xmath36 are depicted as precessing on a cone with random phase so that their projections on the xy plane vanish on the average . equations ( 2.7 , 2.8 ) show that the relative angle @xmath37 between the two projections is changed by the action of the local torque .    when the two partial waves merge at the final mirror of the interferometer in fig .",
    "3 , their spin correlation angle is    @xmath38    the intensities in the two outgoing beams are of course given by the same eqs .",
    "however , now the effect has been described as the measurement of a spin correlation .",
    "the factor 2 in eq .",
    "( 2.10 ) is the usual factor for rotations of spin 1/2 .",
    "none of this is really surprising from either a classical or a quantum mechanical point of view .",
    "a spinning particle is represented classically as a symmetric rotor whose angular momentum precesses in a magnetic field .",
    "the precession frequency @xmath39 is independent of the angle between the rotation axis and the magnetic field .",
    "that is why the spin autocorrelations are independent of the spin state in eqs .",
    "classically , the only exceptions are the two states wherein the spin points exactly in the @xmath40 or the @xmath41 direction , a set of measure zero for which the x and y components vanish and the precession frequency has no meaning . however , if one defines the precession frequency by any limiting process , it again has the value @xmath39 . in quantum mechanics",
    "only the expectation values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 vanish .",
    "their fluctuations are large , equal in magnitude to @xmath28 . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the local magnetic field separates the energies of the two states of definite @xmath28 and that energy separation gives rise to the precession of@xmath42 and @xmath43 which becomes visible in the spin autocorrelation functions .",
    "the scalar aharonov - bohm effect has been described as the ordinary action of a magnetic field on the magnetic moment of the neutron , causing the neutron to precess in the ordinary way .",
    "the return torque transmits angular momentum to the local contemporaneous magnetic field in the ordinary way .",
    "locality in the sense of faraday and maxwell is preserved to the extent that it ever is in quantum mechanics .",
    "we have identified measurable dynamical variables , the spin autocorrelation operators , whose operator equations of motion obey the classical laws .",
    "the conventional semiclassical vector model shows exactly how the torque in the magnetic field acts on the spin autocorrelation .",
    "sab is not a topological effect in the same sense as is the ab effect , in spite of the mathematical similarity of sab and electric ab effect . in sab ,",
    "we know exactly where the neutron experienced the torque that changed the outcome of the experiment , and no gauge transformation can obscure that information .",
    "allman @xmath44 @xcite defined a topological effect as one in which the relative phase shift @xmath45 is independent of the energy of the neutron .",
    "that criterion was justified by a result of zeilinger@xcite , who however showed only that the energy independence is a necessary condition for a force - free effect .",
    "the trouble with using that criterion in the present context can be seen by considering a problem in which the magnetic field in one arm of the interferometer is replaced by an optical phase shifter whose index of refraction is made to depend upon the time and to differ from unity only during the time the neutron is inside some box , for instance by pumping a refractive gas in and out . in principle , the phase shift can be made independent of the energy over the experimental range .",
    "no electromagnetic field is involved .",
    "the energy - independence criterion would describe the influence of that phase shifter as a topological effect .",
    "we have chosen to discuss the aharonov - bohm effect on the magnetic moment of a spin- 1/2 particle in terms of the sab effect because of the experimental interest in that example .",
    "however the discussion is identical for the aharonov - casher ( ac ) effect @xcite . in ac , a neutron with @xmath46 traverses an external electric field in the @xmath47 plane . in an adequate approximation ,",
    "the ac hamiltonian is given by eq.j(2.2 ) , where now @xmath48 is the magnetic field in the rest frame of the neutron , given by      for a neutron whose velocity is confined to the @xmath47 plane , points in the @xmath24 direction and interference effects not ascribable to forces , like those in sab , are predicted .",
    "however , the torques , spin autocorrelations , and angular momentum exchange with the local maxwell field appear to be the same as in sab , so it follows that ac , like sab , is neither a nonlocal nor a topological effect .",
    "the basic physics underlying our argument is in fact very simple .",
    "the spin of a neutron precesses in an external magnetic field as a result of the local interaction of the neutron magnetic moment with the field .",
    "this precession has been observed in many experiments .",
    "it is conjectured that such precession is absent when the neutron spin is exactly in the directions of the field and the components of the spin normal to the field vanish exactly ; e.g. for a field in the z - direction the spin components satisfy the condition @xmath50",
    "however this condition can be satisfied in classical mechanics only for a set of states of measure zero . in quantum mechanics this condition can not be satisfied at all , since the operators @xmath51 and @xmath52 do not commute with one another and furthermore do not have an allowed zero eigenvalue .",
    "the expectation values of @xmath51 and @xmath53 do indeed vanish when a neutron is  polarized in the z - direction \" ; i.e. when it is in an eigenstate of @xmath54",
    ". however , this only means that their average value vanishes .",
    "we have shown here that the precession in the magnetic field of the spin components normal to the field is still observable , even when the neutron is so - called  polarized in the direction of the field \" .",
    "this precession is in fact observed experimentally in the ac and sab effects .",
    "we have pointed out a marked difference between the topology and locality which characterize the ab and the analogous considerations in ac and sab .",
    "instead the sab experiment provides evidence that the normal components of the neutron spin do indeed precess with the normal precession frequency in an external magnetic field , even though the expectation values of these normal components vanish .",
    "the precession is expressed formally by spin autocorrelation functions .",
