    "noise , also known as photon noise , is a basic form of uncertainty associated with the measurement of light",
    ". an image sensor measures scene irradiance by counting the number of photons incident on the sensor over a given time interval .",
    "the photon counting is a classic poisson process that follows poisson distribution [ 1 ] .",
    "poisson noise removal is a fundamental task for many imaging applications where images are generated by photon - counting devices such as computed tomography ( ct ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and astronomical imaging .",
    "many methods and algorithms have been proposed for poisson denoising [ 2 - 21 ] . in this paper , we focus on solving the variational poisson denoising model proposed in [ 9 ] .    in [ 9 ] , along the lines of the famous rof model [ 22 ] , le , chartrand and asaki proposed the following poisson denoising model with total variation regularization ( called lca model in this paper ) . in detail , if @xmath0 ( @xmath1 , a bounded , open subset of @xmath2 ) is an original image with poisson noise , then the reconstructed image @xmath3 is obtained by    @xmath4    where the functional @xmath5 is defined on the set of @xmath6 such that @xmath7 ; in particular , @xmath8 must be positive almost everywhere ( a.e . ) in @xmath9 .",
    "the authors used gradient descent with the forward - time central - space finite difference scheme to solve problem ( 1 ) .",
    "they implemented a straightforward , discretized version of the following pde : @xmath10 spatial derivatives are computed with standard centered difference approximations .",
    "the quantity @xmath11 is replaced with @xmath12 for a small , positive @xmath13 . the time evolution is done with fixed time step @xmath14 , until the change in @xmath8 is sufficiently small .",
    "however , this numerical scheme has two main drawbacks : 1 ) the reconstructed image @xmath15 obtained by this scheme can not be guaranteed to be positive a.e . in @xmath9 mathematically ; in fact , our experiments show that the reconstructed image @xmath15 is sign - changing in @xmath9 .",
    "the functional @xmath5 is singular in the non - positive orthant of the sign - changing solution @xmath15 due to the presence of @xmath16 in the functional @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , @xmath15 is not the best approximation to @xmath3 defined by ( 1 ) .",
    "2 ) the time step @xmath14 must be chosen small enough to ensure the stability of the used explicit numerical scheme due to the cfl condition .",
    "after the lca model , many algorithms were proposed to solve the lca model . in [ 10 ] ,",
    "chan and chen proposed a multilevel algorithm for efficiently solving the lca model .",
    "however , this method also confronts the problem that the reconstructed image is sign - changing in @xmath9 and it spends a little long time . in [ 13 ] , figueiredo and bioucas - dias used an alternating direction method of multipliers to solve the lca model . to address the problem that the reconstructed image is sign - changing in @xmath9",
    ", they replaced @xmath8 with the projection @xmath17 during iteration .",
    "however , @xmath5 is still meaningless because of @xmath18 for @xmath19 .    in this letter",
    ", we first prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution for the lca model by a different method .",
    "then a semi - implicit difference scheme is designed to solve numerically the derived gradient descent flow of the lca model .",
    "the proposed scheme can guarantee the restored image to be strictly positive in the image domain and is stable for a large time step .",
    "in this paper , we propose a new method to solve the poisson denoising model [ 9 ] :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is a subset of @xmath22 and @xmath23 is an original image with poisson noise .    inspired by the proof of theorem 4.1 in [ 23 ] , in the following we give a new proof of the existence and uniqueness of solution for problem ( 3 ) , which differs from the proof in [ 9 ] .",
    "if @xmath24 , then problem ( 1 ) has exactly one solution .",
    "let @xmath25 and @xmath26 . since @xmath27 decreases if @xmath28 and increases if @xmath29 , we have @xmath30 and similarly , @xmath31 since @xmath32 and @xmath33 we have @xmath34 and @xmath35 thus we can assume @xmath36 a.e . in @xmath9 .    since @xmath24 , we have @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which implies that @xmath5 is bounded below in @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath40 be the minimization sequence of problem ( 3 ) such that @xmath41 then , there is an @xmath42 such that , for every @xmath43 , @xmath44 which implies @xmath45 recalling that @xmath46 , thus @xmath40 is bounded in @xmath22 which implies there exists a @xmath47 such that , up to a subsequnce , @xmath48 weakly in @xmath49 and strongly in @xmath50 .",
    "since @xmath51 a.e . in @xmath52",
    ", we have @xmath53 a.e . in @xmath52 .",
    "we further have @xmath54 a.e . in @xmath52 ; otherwise , up to a sequence , @xmath55 which contradicts with the fact that @xmath56 thus @xmath57 .",
    "thanks to the lower semi - continuity of the total variation and fatou s lemma , we get that @xmath58 is a solution of problem ( 3 ) .",
    "the uniqueness of the solution is guaranteed by the strict convexity of problem ( 3 ) .    in what follows",
    ", we design a semi - implicit difference scheme for the discretization of the gradient descent flow for problem ( 3 ) .",
    "the gradient descend flow of problem ( 3 ) is @xmath59    to guarantee that the restored image is positive , we design the following semi - implicit difference scheme to discretize equation ( 4 ) : @xmath60 equation ( 5 ) can be rewritten as @xmath61 the restored image is given as the positive solution of equation ( 6 ) : @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "in this section , we present some experimental results to show the performance and the effectiveness of the proposed numerical scheme , in comparison to other relevant numerical schemes in [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] and [ 13 ] in terms of quality and time .",
    "ten images are chosen as test images , which are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the corresponding poisson noisy images were generated from the test images by using the matlab command ",
    "imnoise  with noise type parameter  poisson  .",
    "since poisson noise depends only on the intensity of the image , there is no extra parameter in the matlab command .",
    "the stop criteria for our method is set as @xmath65 .",
    "the parameters for the proposed numerical scheme are set as @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the parameters for the numerical scheme in [ 9 ] are set as @xmath66 , @xmath69 and iteration numbers are all set 30 for all experiments .",
    "the parameters for the multilevel algorithm [ 10 ] are set as @xmath70 , @xmath71 ; by our experiments , @xmath70 is averagely the best value for the ten test images .",
    "the parameters for the method [ 13 ] are set as the same values as in [ 13 ] : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the maximal value of the poisson image .",
    "the inner and outer iteration numbers of the method [ 13 ] are 10 and 6 , respectively , which can averagely achieve the highest signal - to - noise ratio ( psnr ) and the structural similarity index ( ssim ) .    in figure 2 ,",
    "an example of the denoised results for the compared algorithms are given . from figure 2",
    ", we can see that our algorithm and the algorithms [ 10 , 13 ] have similar visual effects , while the image restored by the algorithm [ 9 ] is somewhat blur .    to evaluate the performance of the compared algorithms quantitatively ,",
    "the indexes psnr and ssim are used to measure the similarity between the denoised image and the original noisy - free image .",
    "the resulting values are displayed in table 1 .",
    "since the code provided by the authors of [ 10 ] can only process the images of same width and height , some of the psnr and ssim of the algorithm [ 10 ] can not be listed in table 1 . from table 1",
    ", we can see that our algorithm and the algorithm [ 13 ] have almost same psnr and ssim values averagely , which outperform ones of the algorithms in [ 9 ] and [ 10 ] .",
    "but the runtime for our algorithm is almost one - fifth of the runtime for the algorithm [ 13 ] .     +     +   +    [",
