    "vortices in magnetic field concentrations in the simulated upper solar photosphere , first identified by @xcite , have recently attracted a lot of interest .",
    "these structures have been suggested as a primary candidate mechanism for energy transport from the solar interior to the outer layers of the solar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite demonstrated that the major contributor to vertical vorticity in these photospheric magnetic field concentrations is magnetic tension in the low plasma @xmath0 regions .",
    "initial analysis of velocity fields in magnetic photospheric vortices demonstrated a complex multi - layered structure of oppositely rotating surfaces with nearly constant vorticity that are parallel to the magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a similar behaviour of the velocity field in the solar photospheric simulations carried out with co5bold @xcite .",
    "poynting flux emerging from the simulated solar photosphere was linked to the horizontal plasma motions in the photospheric magnetic field @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that vortex motions in the simulated photosphere are able to dissipate their energy and produce additional local heating of the solar chromosphere .",
    "@xcite suggested that small - scale solar atmospheric eruptions , such as spicules , are linked to horizontal vortex - like motions in photospheric magnetic flux tubes .",
    "@xcite observationally demonstrated excitation of incompressible waves in the solar chromosphere by photospheric vortex motions . using multi - wavelength observations",
    ", it was recently demonstrated that these essentially magnetic structures extend from the lower photosphere to the corona , and are connected to the observed swirls in the solar chromosphere @xcite and lower coronal regions @xcite .    in this letter , using a time series of magnetised photospheric models produced by the muram code @xcite , we further analyse the character of plasma motions in intergranular magnetic field concentrations . we demonstrate that , if dependence of the local velocity field on time is taken into account , the apparent swirling motions in the strong magnetic field disappear , and swirls do not exist in photospheric magnetic flux tubes . instead , a wave - like behaviour is observed for horizontal motions of test particles following the time - dependent velocity field . the restoring force of magnetic tension acts as a conduit of oscillatory vorticity upward from deeper photospheric layers , where it is generated by convective motions .",
    "using vertical - component - of - vorticity time - distance diagrams taken along a vertical axis we show that the vorticity perturbations propagate upward along the nearly - vertical field lines of photospheric magnetic field concentrations with time - dependent local alfvn speed , and thus can be identified as torsional alfvn waves .",
    "this result also explains quasiperiodic oscillations and the short lifetimes of photospheric magnetic vortices , as noted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this letter is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the simulation setup and the data we use for our analysis of photospheric vortices .",
    "the time - distance analysis of plasma motions in the upper - photospheric magnetic field concentrations is described in section 3 .",
    "section 4 concludes our findings .",
    "the muram radiative mhd code @xcite has been used to carry out simulations of the magnetised solar photosphere .",
    "the code is well - tested , has demonstrated similar performance to other radiative mhd codes available in the community@xcite , and has been widely used to provide an insight into the physical processes behind various solar observational phenomena , such as , for example , sunspots @xcite , magnetic flux emergence @xcite , and photospheric bright points @xcite .",
    "the code reproduces thermal and radiative properties of the solar photosphere well , as demonstrated by comparison of simulated photospheric spectral lines with observations @xcite .    for the analysis presented in this letter we use the code setup described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the physical domain size is @xmath1 in the horizontal directions and @xmath2 in the vertical direction , and the resolution is @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . to generate the photospheric data",
    ", we introduce a uniform 200 g vertical magnetic field into a well - developed non - magnetic photospheric convection model , and , after the initial transient phase ( about 40 minutes of physical time ) , we record 240 snapshots of photospheric model data with a mean cadence of 2.41 seconds .",
    "this short time step is required to capture processes at alfvnic time scales in strongly magnetised regions of the solar photosphere where the characteristic speed can reach 50100 @xmath5 .    during the initial simulation phase",
    ", the magnetic field is advected into the intergranular lanes by convective motions , and photospheric magnetic flux concentrations with the strength of about 1.7 kg at the continuum formation height and of about 800 g in the upper photosphere are formed .",
    "simultaneously , magnetic vortex structures appear in the low plasma @xmath0 regions of the simulated solar atmosphere .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] displays the dependences of absolute values of magnetic ( black curve ) and hydrodynamic ( blue curve ) sources in the vertical component of vorticity according to equation ( 4 ) of @xcite , as well as the modulus of the vertical component of vorticity itself ( pink curve ) , all averaged horizontally over the numerical domain .",
    "the figure shows that in the lower photosphere ( below 0.2 mm ) the main source of vorticity is compressible fluid motion .",
    "conversely , in the strongly magnetised upper photosphere ( above 0.2 mm ) , magnetic sources dominate over purely hydrodynamic vorticity sources .",
    "this clearly indicates that magnetic field effects are responsible for a strong increase in vertical vorticity above 0.3 mm in the photosphere .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the vorticity source term , which contains magnetic tension , is responsible for this effect .",
    "to visualise the three - dimensional velocity field in as simple and clear a manner as possible , we use a small number of seed particles that are randomly magnetic field - weight distributed around a magnetic field concentration over a horizontal plane close to the top boundary of the domain .",
    "this biases them toward the strong - field regions near the tube axis .",
    "we first plot probe particle tracks under the action of the velocity field obtained from the first snapshot of the data series .",
    "an example of probe particle tracks under the action of this velocity field is shown in fig .",
    "these are streamlines .",
    "as is evident from the figure , a vortex - like structure is present in the upper part of the simulated photosphere .",
    "however , if the probe particles with the same initial coordinates are let to evolve in the time - dependent velocity field from the whole time series of the simulation , the upper - photospheric vortex completely disappears and is replaced by nearly random , quasi - oscillatory particle tracks ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "these are pathlines .",
    "streamlines and pathlines coincide only in steady flows .",
    "their disparity clearly demonstrates that three - dimensional flow in upper - photospheric vortices in regions of strong magnetic field is far from steady .",
    "@xcite recently pointed out that the low twist of the magnetic field lines in their modelling indicates a non - stationary character of the flow .",
    "indeed , the time scale for flow change is similar to the flow time scale itself .",
    "thus , processes in the upper - photospheric magnetic vortices can not be physically related to those in sinks or tornadoes in earth s atmosphere , where steady velocity fields are present .",
    "vortical flow in a low - beta atmosphere can not be sustained over many alfvn crossing times unless it is an essentially solid - body rotation induced by rotational flows or flux tube unwindings in the high - beta layers below , since dominant magnetic tension will resist it .",
    "in the following section , we confirm this finding with more detailed analysis of propagation of the vorticity perturbation through the solar atmosphere .",
    "basic analysis of the probe particle motions given in the previous section shows an absence of steady vortex flows in photospheric magnetic field concentrations .",
    "the presence of both vorticity signs , earlier reported by @xcite and @xcite , manifests both clockwise and anti - clockwise torsional motions within the same magnetic structure .",
    "this fact suggests wave - like motions of the plasma in photospheric magnetic field concentrations . to study these waves and to identify their types we perform time - distance analysis of the vorticity perturbation along the magnetic field lines in the simulated domain .",
    "construction of time - dependent three - dimensional magnetic surfaces is a computationally difficult task , so we choose points where the magnetic field is nearly vertical in the neighbourhood of the upper boundary of the domain .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows a map of the vertical ( @xmath6-)component of vorticity measured at about 500 km above the average continuum formation level ( left panel ) , and four examples of time - distance diagrams of vertical propagation of the vertical component of vorticity . in choosing the examples , we restricted the selection to waves that propagate upwards only , though both upward and downward directions of wave propagation are observed .",
    "as is evident from the plots , all examples show oscillatory patterns of fast - propagating perturbations along the vertical direction .",
    "we were able to identify the wave type by overplotting the path for a test particle , which moves with the local , time - dependent alfvn speed , according to the equation @xmath7 in _ cgs _ units , where @xmath8 is local time - dependent vertical flow speed .",
    "the test particle tracks are plotted over the time - distance diagrams and clearly coincide with the oscillatory pattern of the vertical component of the vorticity .",
    "notably , the mean vertical flow speed averaged over the time series never exceeds @xmath9 , and the maximum vertical flow speed is about @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , motions of the test particles with speed about @xmath11 can not be explained by vertical plasma flows , as is evident from fig .",
    "this finding demonstrates that the propagation speed for the vorticity perturbation is equal to the alfvn speed . in the plots shown in the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the maximum magnetic field inclination angle in the time - distance region where a clear wave propagation pattern is observed is less than @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the assumption about equivalence of propagation along the magnetic field line and along the vertical direction is well - justified . summarising the findings ,",
    "the perturbation in the vertical component of the vorticity , that propagates vertically along magnetic field lines , is a horizontal torsional velocity perturbation , and thus it can be identified as a torsional alfvn wave .",
    "in fact , nearly all vertical columns in the regions of strong magnetic field in the simulation domain show propagation of a perturbation with speed close to the alfvn speed .",
    "abundance of these patterns in the domain and nearly perfect agreement between the perturbation phase speed and the alfvn speed also rule out a possibility of advection of pre - existing vorticity patterns by horizontal bulk flows .",
    "thus , it can be concluded that torsional alfvn waves originating in the higher photosphere are abundant in plage regions of the solar photosphere .",
    "in this letter , we analysed apparent photospheric magnetic vortex structures in a dynamic realistic simulation of solar photospheric magnetoconvection .",
    "we identified that no long - lived vortex structures in photospheric magnetic field concentrations exist .",
    "instead , the time - dependent velocity field obtained from the simulations shows oscillatory behaviour in the strong intergranular magnetic field regions . using time - distance analysis of the vertical component of vorticity we found that the perturbations propagate vertically along the magnetic field lines with speeds equal to the local alfvn speed .",
    "thus we identified the perturbations as torsional alfvn waves in intergranular magnetic flux concentrations . in the structures shown in our simulations the velocity pattern changes within approximately 50 seconds to the opposite direction .",
    "this timescale is considerably shorter than the lifetime of the inter granular magnetic field concentrations which continue to exist throughout this process .",
    "as our study shows , we must exercise caution when visualising three - dimensional motions in the turbulent and magnetised solar atmosphere .",
    "steady velocity fields can not be used for analysis , since the speed with which the velocity pattern changes is of the same order as the actual velocity , while studies of time - dependent velocity fields impose additional requirements on the simulated data series , such as spatial resolution and cadence , as well as on the computational resources needed to perform the computations .",
    "the vorticity perturbations we observe in the simulations , unlike pure alfvn waves , cause perturbations in thermodynamic parameters of the solar plasma .",
    "these perturbations are possibly caused by some unavoidable amount of artificial diffusivity and resistivity included in the code for numerical stability .",
    "another reason for these perturbations may be that other , magneto - acoustic oscillatory modes are present in the simulated magnetic field concentrations .",
    "it also should be mentioned that , apparently , photospheric magnetic bright point motions , which originate at the base of the photosphere , do not represent good candidates for this type of wave observation , since they are formed deeper in photospheric layers @xcite .",
    "their measured paths @xcite suggest a hydrodynamic , non - oscillatory type of photospheric horizontal motion .",
    "previous observational and theoretical reports on alfvn waves in the solar chromosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in sunspots @xcite clearly suggest that alfvn waves are a common phenomenon in strong solar magnetic fields .",
    "interestingly , recent high - cadence observations of prominences show that their tornado - like appearance is `` an illusion due to projection effects '' @xcite , suggesting a general presence of alfvn - type motions in the solar atmosphere and corona .",
    "observational confirmation of the result given in this letter is currently rather difficult since it requires spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric observations with both very high resolution of the order of 2050  km and extremely high cadence of about 2 seconds .",
    "these may become possible with upcoming high - aperture instruments , such as atst .",
    "further investigation of the reaction of spectral line profiles to photospheric alfvn waves will be needed before such an observational attempt .",
    "another interesting problem is detailed identification of the lower - photospheric sources of upper - photospheric torsional waves . among the possibilities are hydrodynamic vortices in the deep photosphere , small - scale granular motions and short - lived turbulent eddies .",
    "further theoretical and computational work is needed to fully determine the sources of alfvn waves observed in the upper photosphere .",
