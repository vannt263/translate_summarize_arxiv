    "the chiral anomaly is a well - known and fascinating aspect of qcd .",

    "one immediately identifies the theoretical prediction for @xmath7 which arises from the second line of eq .",
    "1 @xmath8 which is in excellent agreement with the experimental value@xcite @xmath9    in a corresponding fashion one can read off from eq .",
    "1 the prediction for the @xmath10 vertex @xmath11 in this case , agreement with the value quoted experimentally@xcite @xmath12 is not particularly convincing and could even be said to favor the value @xmath13 ! however , since such a violation would have severe consequences about the very foundations of qcd it warrants a more careful look , which is the purpose of the present note . since the prediction of the anomaly strictly speaking hold only at zero four - momentum ,",
    "while the experimental data is obtained over a range of energies above threshold , it is essential to understand the energy dependence of the @xmath14 amplitude generated by @xmath15 and higher contributions , and this is done in section ii .",
    "then in section iii we use these results to confront existing experimental information and comment on implications for future experiments such as that approved at cebaf.@xcite",
    "the issue of finite energy correction to predictions of the anomaly has been addressed by a number of authors and is now reasonably well understood .",
    "the first such consideration was that of terentev who , on phenomenological grounds , suggested the form@xcite @xmath16\\ ] ] where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is an phenomenological phase factor , and @xmath19 represents the pure vector dominance contribution .",
    "the next step was taken by rudaz who , noting that the amplitude for @xmath7 could be generated entirely via the vector dominance diagram @xmath20 , _ cf . _",
    "figure 1a , proposed the same for the @xmath14 process , _ cf . _",
    "figure 1b , yielding@xcite @xmath21\\ ] ]    however , it was soon realized that this expression conflicted both with the ksrf relation@xcite as well as with the anomalous ward identities of aviv and zee@xcite and that the correct form was@xcite @xmath22\\ ] ] which contains both a vector dominance piece _ and _ a contact term .    in recent years , the problem has also been addressed via a one loop expansion in chiral perturbation theory , yielding the form , correct to @xmath15 in the derivative expansion@xcite and determine the coefficient of the term linear in s , t , u ( a free parameter in strict chiral perturbation theory ) by demanding agreement with expansion of the vector dominance form eq . 9 . ]",
    "@xmath23\\ ] ] where @xmath24    the vector dominance form  eq .",
    "9may be made consistent with its chiral counterpart  eq .",
    "10provided we include the effects of final state p - wave pi - pi scattering .",
    "we begin by noting that the n / d form @xmath25 with @xmath26 being the familiar p - wave weinberg or current algebra prediction@xcite and @xmath27 providing an analytic approximation to the omnes function , ] but the result is similar.]@xcite provides a rather successful representation for the @xmath28 pi - pi scattering amplitude@xcite @xmath29 likewise , a reasonable approximation to the electromagnetic form factor of the charged pion is@xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is an energy dependent quantity which reduces to the rho width when @xmath32 . here",
    "we have noted that @xmath33 and have utilized the ksrf relation @xmath34.@xcite we observe that eqs . 9 and 10 can be made to agree to low order in @xmath35 provided we use the form @xmath36\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\left({1-{s\\over m_\\rho^2}\\over d_1(s)}\\right ) \\left({1-{t\\over",
    "m_\\rho^2}\\over d_1(t)}\\right)\\left({1-{u\\over m_\\rho^2}\\over d_1(u)}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is suggested by the feature that rescattering occurs in each of the three pi - pi channels simultaneously .",
    "it should also be noted that eq .",
    "20 satisfies the requirements of the fermi - watson theorem ( _ i.e. _ unitarity ) for the process @xmath37 and provides the preferred form to use in future analysis .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , it is often asserted that the experimental and theoretical values for @xmath38 are in significant disagreement .",
    "however , a more careful look at the paper of antipov et al.@xcite reveals that this is not the case .",
    "in fact , the experimental value quoted in eq .",
    "5 obtains only under the assumption that the matrix element @xmath39 is _ independent _ of momentum . on the other hand , averaging the from given by terentev over the experimental spectrum yields ( in units of gev@xmath40)@xcite @xmath41 since the spectral shape given by terentev  eq .",
    "6is basically in agreement with the form given by anomaly considerations eq .",
    "9provided @xmath42 , and since the experiment of antipov et al .",
    "was primarily at low values of the energy where unitarity corrections given by eq .",
    "19 are small we find the solution @xmath43 thus the disagreement with the number required by the chiral anomaly is at the 1.6@xmath44 level rather than the 2.3@xmath44 level generally quoted .",
    "nevertheless , the experimental value is still on the high side and should certainly be subjected to additional experimental scrutiny , as will take place in the approved clas experiment at cebaf.@xcite when such data are analyzed they should use forms such as eq . 20 which both satisfy chiral and unitarity restrictions as well as the phenomenological requirements of vector dominance .",
    "that use of such a form can make a significant difference can be seen in table 1 , where we compare the modifications of the lowest order anomaly prediction as generated by eqs .",
    "10,9,20 .",
    ".spectral modifications to the process @xmath37 generated via eqs .",
    "10,9,20 respectively .",
    "all values of s , t are in units of @xmath45 and the numbers quoted in the table represent percentage deviations from the anomaly prediction . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the region @xmath46 explored by the antipov et al experiment the differences between the various forms are moderate , but in cebaf proposal much larger values of energy and momentum transfer are involved@xmath47 and the use of a properly unitarized form for the decay amplitude is essential in order to extract the value of the anomaly .",
