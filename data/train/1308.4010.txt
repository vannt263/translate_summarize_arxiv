    "soon after its discovery by @xcite , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) was postulated as primarily responsible for the rotational excitation of cn observed in diffuse clouds @xcite .",
    "optical absorption - line measurements of interstellar cn have thus long been used to estimate the temperature of cmb radiation at 2.6 and 1.3  mm , the wavelengths of the two lowest cn rotational transitions @xcite .",
    "it was soon realized , however , that the accuracy of this indirect method is limited by line saturation and local collisional excitation effects .",
    "since the first high accuracy measurements of the cmb temperature by the _ cobe _",
    "satellite @xcite , with the latest value at @xmath6  k @xcite , cn absorption line observations have been used to provide an independent calibration of the _ cobe _ satellite , to sample the cmb far from the near - earth environment , and to measure the rotational excitation of cn in excess of @xmath7 , i.e. the local excitation processes .",
    "differences between the _ cobe _ results and those from cn have recently been discussed by @xcite .",
    "cn absorption lines with very high signal - to - noise ratio were observed recently by @xcite along 13 lines of sight through diffuse molecular clouds .",
    "their careful analysis of the cn rotational excitation implies a mean excess over the temperature of the cmb of only 29@xmath8  mk , which is significantly lower than previous measurements .",
    "if electron - impact is the dominant local cn excitation process , as it is generally assumed , then the excess temperature can yield an estimate of the electron density in the gas @xcite .",
    "the electron density is a crucial parameter for modelling both the physics and chemistry of molecular clouds .",
    "it is generally estimated from the observation of ultraviolet lines of atomic species like c and c@xmath9 . in clouds of modest density ( @xmath10 1000  @xmath5 )",
    "the fractional ionization ( @xmath11 ) is thus typically 10@xmath12  10@xmath13 .",
    "an accurate and independent determination of the electron density from cn excitation obviously requires a good knowledge of the electron - impact excitation rate coefficients .",
    "the first cross section calculations for the electron - impact rotational excitation of cn were based on the born approximation @xcite .",
    "more accurate close - coupling calculations were then performed @xcite and these were found to agree with the born results ( for the @xmath14 transition ) within a factor of 3 above @xmath1515  k @xcite .",
    "more recently , we have revisited the rotational excitation of the cn radical using the r - matrix approach combined with the infinite - order - sudden ( ios ) approximation to derive , for the first time ,",
    "electron - impact spin - coupled cross sections @xcite .",
    "our calculations were restricted to electron energies above 0.1  ev and the high energy results were found to be heavily influenced by both the a  @xmath16 and b  @xmath17 excitation thresholds at 1.52 and 3.49  ev , respectively . at energy below these thresholds , however , the usual propensity rule for parity - conserving transitions ( @xmath18 ) was found to hold .    in this work , we extend the calculations of @xcite to lower collision energies in order to derive rate coefficients down to the low temperatures of the interstellar medium .",
    "in addition to the spin - doubling of cn , we consider also the hyperfine structure . in section  2 , the method employed to derive the fine and hyperfine rate coefficients is outlined and comparisons with other sets of collisional data are presented . in section  3 ,",
    "the results of radiative transfer calculations , including the cmb radiation and local excitation caused by electron and neutral collisions , are presented and compared to observational results .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section  4 .",
    "electron - impact rate coefficients for both fine and hyperfine transitions were calculated from the pure rotational rate coefficients using the ios formalism .",
    "the rotational cross sections were computed as in @xcite by combining r - matrix calculations @xcite , born corrected for dipolar transitions @xcite , with the adiabatic - nuclei - rotation ( anr ) approximation , which is very similar to the infinite - order sudden ( ios ) approximation . both approximations consist of assuming that the target rotational states are degenerate , which is valid when the rotational spacings are negligible with respect to collisional energy . in practice ,",
    "cross sections were obtained for collision energies above 10  mev and they were corrected using a kinematic ratio to account for the rotational spacings , as in @xcite .",
    "they were finally extrapolated down to the rotational thresholds using the procedure described in @xcite , see eq .",
    "( 1 ) of their paper , which was calibrated using the rotational close - coupling results of @xcite .",
    "assuming that the electron velocity distribution is maxwellian , rate coefficients were obtained for temperatures in the range 10 - 1000  k and for transitions among all levels up to @xmath0 = 20 . a similar study by @xcite considered hyperfine structure in electron collisions with the electron spin singlet hcn / hnc system which therefore does not display fine structure splitting .    within the anr or ios formalism , the spin - coupled or fine structure rate coefficients ( and cross sections ) can be obtained from the fundamental pure rotational cross sections , i.e. those out of the lowest @xmath19 level , as follows ( see @xcite and references therein ) : @xmath20 where @xmath0 is the rotational angular momentum of cn , @xmath21 is the electron spin ( here @xmath221/2 ) , @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the pure rotational rate coefficients out of the lowest @xmath19 level . in practice , as the rotational cross sections were corrected for threshold effects and extrapolated , eq .

    "full details on the above procedure can be found in @xcite where scaled ios rate coefficients are compared in detail with almost exact recoupling calculations on cn - h@xmath2 .",
    "the scaled ios method was found by these authors to reproduce the recoupling results within a factor of 3 or better , down to very low temperature .",
    "results should be even better for electron collisions since the electron motion is much more rapid than h@xmath2 and the adiabatic rotational approximation holds at lower temperature .",
    "it should be also emphasized that the ios method properly includes the recoupling algebra , via the 3-@xmath41 and 6-@xmath41 coefficients , and the propensity rules @xmath42 ( parity - conserving ) and @xmath43 are correctly predicted .",
    "@xcite showed that these rules play an important role in radiative transfer applications when line saturation is important .",
    "figures [ fig:00 - 01.eps ] & [ fig:00 - 02.eps ] present the rotational rates @xmath44 and @xmath45 as a function of temperature , up to 1000  k , including a comparison with the relevant data from the work of @xcite which has been so far employed in the astronomical literature .",
    "it is clear that the present rotational rates are larger than those of @xcite , particularly at temperatures below 100  k where our data is about a factor of 2 larger at the peaks .",

    "we can notice that dipolar transitions with @xmath46 have the largest rates for e - cn , in contrast to cn - h@xmath2(@xmath3 ) collisions where transitions with @xmath47 are preferred .",
    "we note , however , that dipolar transitions are also favoured in the case of cn colliding with rotationally excited h@xmath2 ( @xmath48 ) ( lique , private communication ) . for both systems ,",

    "the present data will be made available in the basecol database @xcite .",
    "as explained in the introduction , in diffuse molecular clouds the rotational excitation of cn is controlled by a competition between the collisional excitation and the interaction with the cmb radiation .",
    "this competition results in an excess of the cn rotational excitation over the temperature of the cmb ( 2.725  k ) .",
    "the cn excitation temperature , determined from optical absorption lines , is thus defined as : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the contribution due to local excitation mechanism and @xmath59 is determined through the boltzmann equation : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the column densities of the upper and lower rotational states , respectively , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the corresponding statistical weights . in practice , only the 3 lowest rotational states are significantly populated , i.e. @xmath0=0 , 1 and 2 , yielding the measured excitation temperatures @xmath65(cn ) and @xmath66(cn ) .",
    "the local excitation effects can be also directly determined from a measurement of cn millimetre emission which is unfortunately weak and rarely detected .",
    "observationally , the most recent cn optical absorption - line measurements have provided a weighted mean value of @xmath67  k , implying an excess over the temperature of the cmb of @xmath68  mk @xcite .",
    "we note that the dispersion of these measurements is quite large , i.e. 134  mk , with some sight lines showing ( unphysical ) excitation temperature below @xmath7 .",
    "it is generally assumed that electron - impact excitation is the dominant contribution to this excess temperature .",
    "below we investigate the influence of varying the electron density on the local excitation , using a radiative transfer code combined with the best available electron and neutral collisional rates : those from this work for electrons and those of @xcite for para - h@xmath2(@xmath3 ) , assumed to be identical for hydrogen atoms(@xmath69 ) exceed those for para - h@xmath2(@xmath3 ) by up to a factor of 10 ( lique , private communication ) .",
    "however ortho - h@xmath2(@xmath69 ) can be neglected here since its abundance in cold ( @xmath70  k ) diffuse clouds is expected to be at least 30 times lower than that of para - h@xmath2(@xmath3 ) . ] .",
    "this kind of analysis has been previously performed by @xcite with old collision data .",
    "radiative transfer calculations were performed with the ` radex ` code @xcite , using the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approximation for an expanding sphere .",
    "the kinetic temperature was fixed at @xmath71=20  k , as in the calculations of @xcite . the line width ( fwhm ) was taken to be 1.0  kms@xmath72 , corresponding to a doppler line broadening parameter @xmath73 of 0.6 kms@xmath72 .",
    "the column density was taken at two typical values @xmath74 and @xmath75  @xmath76 .",
    "the density of neutral collision partners ( @xmath77 ) was fixed at three representative values : 100 , 300 and 1000  @xmath5 .",
    "finally the electron abundance was varied from @xmath78 to 1  @xmath5 , corresponding to electron fractions @xmath79 in the range @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",
    "results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cn.eps ] . in each panel , the excitation temperature @xmath65(cn )",
    "is plotted as a function of the electron abundance .",
    "it should be noted that our excitation calculations provide the populations of hyperfine levels , from which @xmath65 was computed by summing over hyperfine sublevels .",
    "the dashed horizontal line gives the cmb at 2.725  k while the horizontal dotted line gives the measured excitation temperature @xmath65 at 2.754  k. we first observe that the excess temperature of 29  mk can not be reproduced at very low electron density , indicating that neutral collisions alone can not explain the local excitation of cn .",
    "this confirms the conclusions of past investigators @xcite .",
    "second , it can be noticed that the local excitation is reproduced for a rather restricted range of electron densities : from 0.01  @xmath5 at @xmath82=1000  @xmath5 to 0.06  @xmath5 at @xmath82=100  @xmath5 with a weak dependence on the cn column density .",
    "assuming hydrogen is entirely molecular , these electron density correspond to electron fractions ( @xmath83 ) in the range @xmath84 .",
    "this is consistent with the abundance of interstellar c@xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) which is the main source of electrons in the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "in fact , more accurate determination of the electron density can be achieved for clouds where the physical conditions are reasonably well known .",
    "for instance , the kinetic temperature and the collision density were determined for the source hd  154368 from the analysis of c@xmath2 excitation by @xcite .",
    "these authors found @xmath87  k and @xmath88 , with @xmath89=60  @xmath5 and @xmath90=90  @xmath5 .",
    "the cn column density towards the star hd  154368 is 2.7@xmath91  @xmath76 and the line width is 1.2  kms@xmath72 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this source also shows the second highest excitation temperature @xmath65(cn)=2.911@xmath92  k , which is significantly larger than the weighted mean value of 2.754  k. using the physical conditions determined by @xcite , we have found that an electron density of 0.3  @xmath5 is necessary to reproduce the measured @xmath65 towards hd  154368 .",
    "this corresponds to an electron fraction @xmath93 , which is too high with respect to the available carbon .",
    "@xcite obtained an even larger value of 0.69  @xmath5 for hd  154368 and concluded that it probably corresponds to an upper limit considering the dispersion of 134  mk .",
    "in fact , for this source , @xcite have detected a weak emission of cn : the strongest hyperfine component @xmath94 at 113.49  ghz with an antenna temperature @xmath95  mk .",
    "figure  [ fig : tmb.eps ] shows that this value ( blue hatched zone ) is reproduced for an electron density of @xmath96  @xmath5 , corresponding to an electron fraction @xmath97 , as expected if carbon is fully ionized . in addition , the corresponding excitation temperature is @xmath98  k , in very good agreement with the weighted mean value of 2.754  k determined by @xcite .    in summary",
    ", our calculations suggest that in the diffuse cloud regions where cn resides , the electron density lie in the range @xmath99  @xmath5 .",
    "this range is significantly smaller than that derived by @xcite , @xmath100  @xmath5 , reflecting the low ( mean ) excess temperature @xmath58=29@xmath8  mk derived by @xcite . on the other hand , for individual sources",
    ", we have shown that the dispersion of the optical measurements ( @xmath15134  mk ) must be taken into account , as recommended by @xcite .",
    "in fact , the weak millimeter emission of cn probably provides the best accurate measurement of @xmath58 , which in turn yields an accurate determination of @xmath101 if the kinetic temperature and hydrogen density is known .",
    "thus , the electron density @xmath102  @xmath76 derived for hd  154368 might represent the best indirect measurement of electron density in a diffuse cloud .",
    "in this work we present a comprehensive set of rates for fine - structure and hyperfine - structure resolved electron - impact rotational excitation of the cn radical .",
    "similar rates have previously been used in an attempt to determine electron densities from shocked regions of the interstellar medium @xcite . here",

    ", our calculations suggest that the electron density lies in the range @xmath4  @xmath5 for typical physical conditions present in diffuse clouds .",
