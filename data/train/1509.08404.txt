    "massive , mixed neutrinos , inferred from the phenomenon of oscillations , remain until this day the only physics found beyond the original formulation of the standard model . while the standard model can be extended to account for these experimental facts , precise measurements of the parameters involved in the phenomenon are necessary to constrain the different theories that attempt to explain it .",
    "the current knowledge favors the existence of three active neutrinos ( flavor eigenstates @xmath1 ) whose mixing can be fully determined by the pmns matrix @xmath2 .",
    "the matrix is often parameterized as the product of three rotation matrices , related to the mixing angles @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and a complex cp phase @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 . the last matrix in the multiplication does not affect neutrino oscillations , and only exists if neutrinos are majorana particles @xcite .",
    "the three angles that determine the mixing matrix are known to a precision of 10% or better @xcite .",
    "the absolute differences of the square of the masses ( mass splittings @xmath10 with @xmath11 ) , which play a role in oscillations , are known to a precision better than 5% .",
    "while the sign of the mass splitting between the states 1 - 2 ( @xmath12 ) is known from matter effects in solar neutrino oscillations , the relative difference between @xmath13 and @xmath14 remains unknown .",
    "the relative values of the neutrino masses are commonly referred to as the neutrino mass ordering ( nmo ) , which has two possible options : the normal ordering ( no ) , with @xmath15 , and the inverted ordering ( io ) , with @xmath16 .",
    "the determination of the nmo is important as the parameter can discriminate between flavor symmetry models @xcite .",
    "also , the sensitivity of experiments attempting to determine the neutrino nature depend on the nmo @xcite . finally , knowing the nmo would help to measure the value of the @xmath6 phase , which in turn would be an important step forward towards solving the fundamental question of the prevalence of matter over anti - matter in the universe .",
    "better measurements of all the parameters involved in neutrino oscillations are therefore necessary to understand if the current model is correct and how to incorporate it to the standard model .    in this view ,",
    "atmospheric neutrinos remain a promising tool for studying oscillations : they cover a wide energy range , from mev to tev , and can reach a detector after traveling distances from a few to about 12700 km when they cross the earth .",
    "no man - made beam covers a similar parameter space .",
    "however , the flux strongly decreases with energy . detecting it implies building large detectors , such as very large volume neutrino telescopes ( vlvnts ) to study atmospheric neutrino oscillations .    in the recent years first antares and",
    "then icecube / deepcore have proven that these studies are feasible by analyzing interactions of neutrinos with energy as low as 15gev .",
    "the current result from icecube on @xmath17 and @xmath18 reaches a precision which is only a factor of three to four times less stringent than global fits which combine all available data @xcite .",
    "building upon the success of these studies , proposals of new , more densely instrumented telescopes , as extensions or part of new projects , have appeared .",
    "pingu and orca aim to improve the precision of these measurements and reduce the energy threshold to a few gev , where matter effects are strong , and use these effects to measure the nmo .",
    "this review begins by covering , in section  [ sec : atm_osc ] , the current knowledge on atmospheric neutrinos , and how oscillations affect their flux .",
    "section  [ sec : vlvnt ] describes the design and operation of vlvnts .",
    "special attention is paid to relevant sources of uncertainty .",

    "the flux of atmospheric neutrinos in the energies relevant for a vlvnt , together with how the flux is modified by neutrino oscillations for those neutrinos that cross the earth , are the topics covered in this section .",
    "cosmic rays ( cr ) continuously arrive at the earth from all directions and interact with nuclei in the atmosphere at altitudes of about 25 km above sea level and initiate showers of particles . during the shower development ,",
    "charged mesons are produced that eventually decay in comparable numbers of muons and neutrinos : @xmath19    the atmospheric muons produced in air showers can travel long distances before they decay .",
    "they are able to penetrate deep into the earth , depending on their energy and the material that they are crossing @xcite , and constitute the dominant background in the measurement of atmospheric neutrinos .     as a function of energy and neutrino arrival direction for neutrinos that cross the earth , as predicted by the latest hkkm model @xcite .",

    "[ fig : atmnu_flux ] ) .",
    "the most noticeable difference between the models is the absolute flux , which changes by up to 20% both for electron and muon ( anti)neutrinos .",
    "apart from that , the models agree that atmospheric neutrinos follow a power - law energy spectrum with a spectral index close to 3 in the energy range @xmath20$]gev",
    ". measurements from @xcite estimate an uncertainty of @xmath21 on the spectral index of atmospheric neutrinos . a similar uncertainty has been also derived from varying the underlying cosmic ray model in neutrino flux calculations @xcite .",
    "muon neutrinos dominate the flux , and also have the hardest spectral index ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : atmnu_flux ] ) .",
    "since electron ( anti)neutrinos mainly come from muons that lose energy before decaying ( see eq.[eq : nu_production ] ) their spectral index is softer , and their relative contribution to the total neutrino flux depends on energy and direction .",
    "the direction - averaged flux of @xmath22 is between 1.1 and 1.3 times smaller than that of @xmath23 , depending on the energy . the electron ( anti)neutrino direction - averaged flux at a few gev is about 2.5 times smaller than its muon ( anti)neutrino counterpart . figure  [ fig : atmnu_ratios ] shows iso - contours of the neutrino flux flavor ratio as a function of energy and zenith angle for neutrinos that cross the earth .",
    "the flux difference between @xmath23 and @xmath24 grows both with energy and @xmath25 . already at 40gev",
    "the direction - averaged ratio is close to four .    above 10gev",
    "the neutrino flux as a function of zenith angle is almost symmetric around @xmath26 .",
    "the angular dependence of the flux at the detection site is influenced by hadronization processes , the local atmospheric density and geomagnetic effects at the interaction point .",
    "the uncertainties associated to these processes result in energy - dependent modeling errors of the arrival zenith angle by up to 20% on the ratio @xmath27 for muon neutrinos and 8% for electron neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the flux of atmospheric neutrinos at a detection site is modified by oscillations .",
    "the oscillations that act over the @xmath29 parameter space accessible with atmospheric neutrinos that cross the earth ( @xmath30km / gev ) are mainly driven by the large mass splitting , @xmath31 and the mixing angles @xmath4 , @xmath5",

    "the angle @xmath4 has been recently measured and found to be small but non - zero @xcite .",
    "it is then the case that @xmath47 can acquire any value , depending on the neutrino energy and the electron density of the material being crossed , as shown in eq .",
    "[ eq : theta_matter ] . for a low electron density or neutrino energy , the parameters ( and equations ) in vacuum are recovered .",
    "a particularly interesting case appears when @xmath48 , which gives @xmath49 , maximizing the mixing between states 1 - 3 , i.e. a resonance appears @xcite .",
    "the effective mass splitting acquires its minimum value under this condition , and is reduced by a factor @xmath50 .",
    "the resonance that leads to maximal 1 - 3 mixing can only happen if the potential @xmath51 and the mass difference @xmath52 have the same sign , so for neutrinos in the case of no and anti - neutrinos in the case of io .",
    "identifying whether the resonance takes place in neutrinos or antineutrinos is a way to identify the nmo .    for @xmath53",

    "note , however , that the approximations presented here serve the purpose of explaining the main features of neutrino oscillations in matter . figures contained in this review , as well as",

    "neutrinos crossing the mantle experience the resonance around @xmath64gev ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : theta_matter ] ) , while the saturation condition @xmath53 is fulfilled already at @xmath65gev .",
    "neutrinos measured by vlvnts then experience oscillations either in the resonant or saturated regime , depending on the energy threshold of the detector .",
    "another interesting effect takes place on neutrinos that cross the earth s core . these neutrinos experience a symmetric electron density profile that changes abruptly . for the right combination of neutrino energy and electron densities ,",
    "a so - called _ parametric resonance _ can appear @xcite .",
    "the effect , however , is not the dominant one at the energies at which future projects ( section  [ sec : future ] ) will be sensitive to .    in the saturated regime",
    "atmospheric neutrino oscillations are independent of the mass ordering , dominated by @xmath66 transitions and well described by eq.[eq : osc_musimple ] . near the resonance condition transitions involving electron ( anti)neutrinos also play a role , and patterns become complex .",

    "transitions of these type are almost symmetric between the two flavors ( see fig .  [",

    "they can measure muon neutrino disappearance as well as tau neutrino appearance , and thus @xmath5 and @xmath44 .",

    "the spacing between the optical sensors define the energy threshold of vlvnts , which is approximately 15gev in currently operating detectors .",

    "the spacing between sensors is uneven , being considerably larger in the @xmath76 plane ( in between lines / strings ) than in the @xmath77 plane .",

    "the neutrino telescopes currently in operation are icecube in antarctica @xcite , antares in the mediterranean sea @xcite , and the prototype of the gigaton volume detector in lake baikal @xcite .",
    "both antares and icecube have published studies of neutrino oscillations , and are therefore the only ones discussed in this review .",
    "antares is located between depths of 2025 - 2475 m , 20 km away from toulon ( french riviera ) , in the mediterranean sea @xcite .",

    "some 50% of the pmts in this region have 35% higher quantum efficiency than the standard icecube pmts .",
    "the deepcore fiducial volume used for data analysis is defined by a cylinder with a height of 350 m and a radius of approximately 150 m that starts below a dust layer , where the light transparency is reduced , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : icecube_diagram ] .",
    "this volume , which corresponds to roughly 2.5 times that of antares , encloses about 550 doms with reduced spacing and results in a threshold for detection and reconstruction of neutrinos of about 15 gev .",
    "the optical modules of both icecube and antares are glass spheres enclosing a ten - inch pmt , optical coupling gel , and a @xmath79-metal cage for magnetic shielding .",
    "the icecube om digitizes the waveforms detected by the pmt inside the module before transmission @xcite , while the antares om keeps the readout to a minimum and only transmits the time and amplitude of a signal above threshold @xcite .",
    "antares optical modules have a baseline noise rate of 70khz at single photon level @xcite , while for icecube ( deepcore ) oms the noise is 0.45khz ( 0.65khz ) @xcite .",
    "the optical properties of the medium affect the time of arrival and the number of detected cherenkov photons . at the antares site ( salt water )",
    "the absorption length , which is 60 m for blue light ( @xmath80470 nm ) and 26 m for uv light ( @xmath80375 nm ) , reduces the number of photons observed . the effective scattering length , which is 256 m for blue light and 122 m for uv light , is considerably larger than the spacing between sensors @xcite . in the clear ice in which deepcore is located",

    "water offers the advantage of being a homogeneous medium .",
    "nonetheless , sea currents can deviate the detector lines so the position of the lines needs to be monitored constantly .",
    "this is achieved by combining acoustic triangulations with tilt and compass measurements yielding a precision better than 10  cm , which does not affect the angular resolution @xcite .",
    "high sea currents can also trigger bioluminescence bursts that must be accounted for in the optical background simulation , in addition to the stable optical noise arising for @xmath81k decays .",
    "the latter can be used for determining the absolute detection efficiency of the optical modules .    in ice ,",
    "the positions of the optical modules are fixed and known to within a few cm .",
    "noise levels are constant and a hundred times lower than in salt water after the detector has stabilized .",
    "a disadvantage of using ice is that the medium is not homogeneous and its structure has to be modeled .",
    "this is particularly challenging in the immediate surroundings of the optical modules .",
    "columns of the original glacier are melted to deploy the instrumentation .",
    "the refreezing process leaves behind clear ice near to the boundaries of the hole , and a cylinder of ice of about 10 cm in diameter with a high concentration of bubbles towards the center of the column .",
    "these changes in ice properties modify the dom angular acceptance measured in the laboratory .",
    "future detectors in ice will consider the possibility of de - gassing the water to avoid trapping air bubbles inside the hole ice , and with that reduce the impact of the medium .",
    "the absolute optical efficiency of the optical modules as well as their angular acceptance must be determined in situ after deployment .",
    "antares and icecube use both controlled light sources and minimum ionizing muons to calibrate the efficiency and timing accuracy of their optical modules @xcite .",
    "relative arrival times are known with a precision better than 3ns and 1.5ns for icecube @xcite and antares , respectively .      the dominant neutrino interaction for most of the energy range that vlvnts can access is neutrino - nucleon deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , with other processes being only a sub - dominant contribution .",
    "nonetheless , below 15gev , the region of interest to search for matter effects in neutrino oscillations and the nmo , quasi - elastic scattering and production of resonances compete with dis processes .",
    "figure[fig : neutrino_xs ] shows a calculation of the competing @xmath82 cross sections around the gev region , together with the data available .",
    "most of the knowledge of neutrino - nucleon cross sections between @xmath83gev comes from bubble chambers or spark chamber detectors which collected comparatively small data samples .",
    "thus , the constraints on the models that describe them are rather weak @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty with the largest impact on the neutrino cross sections for quasi - elastic and resonant interactions , which changes them by up to 40% , is the value of the axial mass that effectively describes the nucleon form factor and has an estimated error of 15%-25% @xcite .",
    "dis interactions in the crossover region have a small momentum transfer .",
    "non - perturbative qcd calculations are required @xcite , and the estimated errors are as well of the order of 20% @xcite .",
    "deep inelastic scattering accounts for 90% or more of the total cross section of neutrinos and antineutrinos above an energy of roughly 12gev , as shown in fig.[fig : neutrino_xs ] .",
    "dis in the perturbative regime is comparatively better understood than the processes discussed so far , with uncertainties coming mainly from the determination of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the nucleons .",
    "the uncertainties on the pdfs change the total cross section by 5% or less @xcite .    at these energies",
    "the neutrino - nucleon dis charged current ( cc ) cross section is quasi - independent of the inelasticity @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) of the interaction , while for antineutrinos the cross section is accompanied by a factor @xmath86 , which suppresses kinematic configurations where the hadronic part of the interaction takes most of the energy .",
    "the inelasticity dependence makes the total @xmath87 cross section about one half of that of @xmath82 .",
    "pdf uncertainties impact the inelasticity dependent cross section by only a few percent @xcite .    while the neutrino - nucleon dis cc cross sections for @xmath24 and @xmath23 are equal , the @xmath88 one is suppressed due to the mass of the tau lepton .",
    "it is only at @xmath89gev that the cross section reaches half of the value of the other neutrino flavors @xcite .            in neutral current interactions ( nc ) one or several hadrons are produced , initiating a hadronic shower . in charged current ( cc )",
    "interactions a hadronic shower is also present , but now the neutrino transforms into a charged lepton .",
    "electrons and taus also initiate a shower of particles after they are produced .",
    "muons , on the other hand , travel practically undisturbed and lose energy at a quasi - constant rate .",
    "for muons passing through water @xmath90gev / m up to a few hundred gev @xcite .",
    "once they travel distances comparable to the detector spacing they can be identified , and charged current @xmath23 interactions can be tagged .",
    "neutrino interactions are reconstructed using the number of photons recorded by the optical module ( or time over threshold ) , as well as the time at which they arrive . for the energy range under consideration ,",
    "the most general hypothesis is an interaction which produces a hadronic shower ( all interaction types ) , an electromagnetic shower ( @xmath24 cc ) or a long range muon ( @xmath23 cc ) .",
    "the direction in which these particles are produced is reconstructed from the arrival times of the emitted photons .",
    "the cherenkov light of muons is produced almost perfectly in a cone .",
    "the light coming from the cascade is also beamed in the cherenkov angle , but the smearing due to multiple particle contributions to it is larger , which degrades the achievable precision of directional reconstructions .",
    "this smearing effect is stronger for hadronic showers .    the energy reconstruction of showers is primarily given by the number of photons detected from a given interaction , and its accuracy depends mainly on the reconstructed position of the interaction vertex .",
    "to estimate the energy an assumption has to be made on whether the shower is hadronic or electromagnetic .",
    "the energy of muons can be estimated by the observed range in the detector .    in principle",
    "it is possible to fit the directions of both cascade and track components in an interaction .",
