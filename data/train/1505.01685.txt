    "electronic bands with non - zero chern numbers are at the origin of a large variety of topological phenomena in condensed - matter systems.@xcite in a pioneering work in 1988 , haldane showed that a two - dimensional graphene - like lattice model with broken time - reversal symmetry can exhibit an integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) without an external magnetic field.@xcite later , in 2005 , kane and mele generalized this model to restore time - reversal symmetry with the help of the natural spin degree of freedom in graphene with spin - orbit coupling.@xcite the lowest - energy spin bands in this model carry non - zero but opposite chern numbers that result in the quantum spin hall effect ( qshe ) , which manifests itself in a quantized conductance associated with the transverse spin current . whereas the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling is too small in graphene to reveal the effect ,",
    "the qshe was later predicted@xcite to occur and measured@xcite in hgte / cdte quantum wells .",
    "the presence of an iqhe in a band with a non - zero chern number indicates a certain similarity between the band and the landau level of the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in a strong magnetic field .",
    "however , in contrast to the latter the energy bands obtained in tight - binding models have usually a non - negligible dispersion . in order to investigate in further details the relation between landau levels and energy bands with non - zero chern numbers , special effort has recently been invested into the engineering of flat bands in specially designed tight - binding models.@xcite if these bands are partially filled and if electron - electron interactions are taken into account , one would then expect correlation effects similar to the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) .",
    "the effect , also called fractional chern insulator , was later corroborated within numerical studies@xcite ( for recent reviews , see ) .",
    "the analogy between flat bands with non - zero chern number and landau levels can be pushed further when the internal spin degree of freedom is taken into account .",
    "indeed , when there are as many electrons as flux quanta threading the 2deg , the spins are spontaneously aligned and form a ferromagnetic state ( quantum hall ferromagnet ) in order to minimize the electron - electron repulsion.@xcite this situation corresponds to half - filling in a lattice model if only the two lowest ( spin ) bands are taken into account . however , in contrast to landau levels , where time - reversal symmetry is broken by the external magnetic field and the landau levels occur merely in two spin copies , the situation is more involved in lattice models .",
    "one needs to distinguish two generic situations . in the first one , time - reversal symmetry",
    "is preserved such that spin and orbital degrees of freedom are coupled . in this case , possible spin excitations are described in the framework of rather unusual commutation relations for the spin - density operators@xcite and the resulting ferromagnetic state is expected to respect the underlying z@xmath2 symmetry of topological insulators.@xcite this type of ferromagnetism has recently been investigated within numerical exact - diagonalization studies by neupert _",
    "et al . _ , who find a gapped ising ferromagnetic ground state.@xcite the second situation arises when time - reversal symmetry is broken on the level of the lattice model , and where the chern bands occur in two spin copies without any spin - orbit structure .    in the present paper",
    ", we investigate ferromagnetism in both situations , within a specially adapted tight - binding model on a square lattice with on - site hubbard repulsion that is a generalization of the model originally presented in ref .  .",
    "the tight - binding model , in the absence of interactions , bears a staggered @xmath1-flux phase for each spin component , and time - reversal symmetry determines whether the two spin species experience either the same or an opposite flux per plaquette . if time - reversal symmetry is broken , one is confronted with a correlated flat - band chern insulator , whereas one finds a correlated flat - band z@xmath2 topological insulator in the case of preserved time - reversal symmetry .",
    "for both situations , we investigate the ferromagnetic state at quarter - filling of the lattice that corresponds to half - filling of the two lowest energy bands . in order to investigate its stability and collective spin - wave excitations",
    ", we construct a nonpertubartive bosonization scheme similar to the one proposed in ref . to describe the 2deg at filling factor @xmath4 .",
    "such a formalism was also applied to study quantum hall ferromagnetic phases realized in graphene at filling factors @xmath5 and @xmath6@xcite and to describe the bose - einstein condensate of magnetic excitons realized in a bilayer quantum hall system at total filling factor @xmath7.@xcite          we show that the bosonization scheme,@xcite originally developed for the 2deg at filling factor @xmath3 , can be generalized for lattice models that describe flat - band chern and z@xmath2 topological insulators .    for both _ correlated _ chern and z@xmath2 topological insulators described above , we map the interacting fermion model to an effective _ interacting _ boson model .",
    "we consider the effective boson model in the harmonic approximation and show that the ground state is indeed given by a spin polarized ( ferromagnetic ) state .",
    "our main results are in fact the analytical calculation of the spin - wave excitation spectra of both ferromagnets ( figs .",
    "[ fig : disp - u ] and [ fig : disp - u - sqhe ] ) .",
    "the spin - wave dispersion relation corresponds to the energy of the bosons at the harmonic approximation .",
    "due to the bipartite nature of the underlying square lattice , we identify two types of collective spin - wave excitations .",
    "we find that the correlated flat - band chern insulator has one gapless and one gapped spin - wave excitation branches ( fig .",
    "[ fig : disp - u ] ) while the correlated flat - band topological insulator , two gapped ones ( fig .",
    "[ fig : disp - u - sqhe ] ) .",
    "for the latter , the excitation gap we obtain at zero - wave vector coincides with the result numerically calculated by neupert _",

    "the spin - dependent phases @xmath32 reflect that time - reversal symmetry is preserved for @xmath33 , whereas it is broken if @xmath34 ( see appendix  [ ap : symmetries ] for details ) .",
    "the tight - binding model is a generalization for the case of electrons with spin of the @xmath1-flux model discussed in ref .  .",
    "since the nearest - neighbor hopping energy is complex , each electron acquires a phase @xmath1 as it hops around a plaquette in the direction of the arrows indicated in fig .",

    "after fourier transformation , i.e. , introducing @xmath38 with the momentum sum running over the bz associated with the underlying bravais lattice [ see fig .",
